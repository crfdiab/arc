Why is Venus longest day?
-------------------------

A planet’s day is the time it takes the planet to rotate or spin once on its axis. Venus rotates much more slowly than Earth does, so a day on Venus is much longer than a day on Earth. A day on Venus lasts for 243 Earth days or 5,832 hours! A day on Earth is 23.943 hours.

Why does Venus have the longest rotation period of all the planets?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The sun’s gravitational pull is very strong on Venus and Mercury, making their rotations very slow and their days longer than their years. Venus’s period of rotation is 254 days, while a Venusian year is only 224 days.

How long is the solar system’s longest day Venus has the answer?
----------------------------------------------------------------

‘ It was already known that Venus has the longest day – the time the planet takes for a single rotation on its axis – of any planet in our solar system, though there were discrepancies among previous estimates. The study found that a single Venusian rotation takes 243.0226 Earth days.

Why does Venus have The Longest Day, based on its?
--------------------------------------------------

The length of its day is not necessarily related to the size of a planet. It is thought that Venus was hit during its formation by a large planetesimal that effectively slowed and reversed its rotation, possibly an off centre impact by flipping the planet upside down?

Which is the planet with the longest day?
-----------------------------------------

It was already known that Venus has the longest day – the time the planet takes for a single rotation on its axis – of any planet in our solar system, though there were discrepancies among previous estimates. The study found that a single Venusian rotation takes 243.0226 Earth days.

Which is closer to the Sun, Venus or the Earth?
-----------------------------------------------

Venus is closer to the Sun; therefore, its orbit takes a shorter period of time than its rotation upon its axis. The planet also rotates in retrograde. That means it spins in the opposite direction of the Earth.

Why is Venus in the position it is?
-----------------------------------

Venus’ fate only makes sense when part of this greater narrative. Otherwise, it would have been another, warmer Earth. This is because Venus is a very new planet, in its current form and position. So it has not had time to gain a proper rotation, by way of millions of years of normalising the rotations of other objects.
