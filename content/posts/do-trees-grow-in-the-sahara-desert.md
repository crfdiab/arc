Do trees grow in the Sahara desert?
-----------------------------------

Despite conceptions that the Sahara Desert is a desolate wasteland, in fact it is home to 1.8 billion trees. Researchers discovered this by utilizing satellite imagery from NASA, and deep learning. This is the first time that anyone counted trees across a large dryland region.

What climate is found in the Sahara?
------------------------------------

The Sahara is dominated by two climatic regimes: a dry subtropical climate in the north and a dry tropical climate in the south. The dry subtropical climate is characterized by unusually high annual and diurnal temperature ranges, cold to cool winters and hot summers, and two precipitation maximums.

What animals live in Sahara?
----------------------------

Among the mammal species still found in the Sahara are the gerbil, jerboa, Cape hare, and desert hedgehog; Barbary sheep and scimitar-horned oryx; dorcas gazelle, dama deer, and Nubian wild ass; anubis baboon; spotted hyena, common jackal, and sand fox; and Libyan striped weasel and slender mongoose.

Is there a greening of the Sahara Desert?
-----------------------------------------

Studying past climate variability in northern Africa is a key tool for gaining a better understanding of a potential future greening of the Sahel or Sahara and its climatic and environmental implications.

When was the last time the Sahara was green?
--------------------------------------------

Under a “high-emission” scenario (i.e., business as usual), by the end of the century CO 2 levels will reach values last seen 50 million years before present (BP; &gt;1,000 ppm), a period of climate warmth and a green northern tropical Africa. 23,24

How does the WAM affect the climate of the Sahara Desert?
---------------------------------------------------------

The WAM regulates the annual rainfall amount and the climatological rainfall patterns, which in the long term affect land-surface characteristics, determine the type of vegetation that can survive in the region, and modulate mineral-dust emissions.

Are there any wet periods in the Sahara Desert?
-----------------------------------------------

The Sahara Desert has indeed periodically experienced wet periods, often termed African humid periods (AHPs), with a more vegetated landscape, extending back to at least the late Miocene 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 (∼10 million years BP).
