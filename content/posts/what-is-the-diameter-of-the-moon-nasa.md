What is the diameter of the moon NASA?
--------------------------------------

3,476 km  
The diameter of the Moon (D) is 3,476 km.

What percentage of the moon’s diameter is taken up by the lunar core?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System, after Io. However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about 350 kilometres (220 mi) or less, around 20% of the radius of the Moon.

Is the core of the moon small?
------------------------------

The Moon’s core is, in fact, proportionately smaller than the cores of any of the inner planets in the Solar System.

How did NASA determine the internal structure of the moon?
----------------------------------------------------------

NASA deployed the frist seismographs on the moon as part of the Apollo Mission in 1969. These seismographs collected data and enabled researchers to determine that the moon’s structure consisted of a thin crust of about 65 kilometers, a mantle about 100 kilometers thick and a core with a radius of about 500 kilometers.

How big is the core of the Moon?
--------------------------------

The team’s findings suggest the moon possesses a solid, iron-rich inner core with a radius of nearly 150 miles and a fluid, primarily liquid-iron outer core with a radius of roughly 205 miles. Where it differs from Earth is a partially molten boundary layer around the core estimated to have a radius of nearly 300 miles.

How did NASA get data from the Moon?
------------------------------------

Moonquakes and meteoroid impacts accounted for the majority of the data, though NASA did intentionally crashed rocket stages of several Saturn V moon rockets and the lunar landers used in the Apollo missions to help calibrate the seismic network.

How did Buzz Aldrin find the core of the Moon?
----------------------------------------------

Buzz Aldrin deploys a seismometer in the Sea of Tranquility. Signals from seismic sensors left on the lunar surface by Apollo astronauts in the 1970s have revealed new insight into the moon’s core, thanks to a fresh analysis using 21st century computing power.

What kind of magnetic field does the Moon have?
-----------------------------------------------

The data sheds light on the evolution of a lunar dynamo — a natural process by which our moon may have generated and maintained its own strong magnetic field.
