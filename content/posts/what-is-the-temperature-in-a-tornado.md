What is the temperature in a tornado?
-------------------------------------

During this type of storm there is an extremely strong updraft of warm moist Gulf air with temperatures that are usually above 75 degrees F. This gulf air interacts with the fast moving cooler northern air moving south. The last factor needed to produce the tornado is the jet stream to be moving at least 150 mph.

Is it hot during a tornado?
---------------------------

There is no particular temperature at which tornadoes form. Even if it is cold near the surface, as long as it is colder higher up, the winds are right to set up low-level wind shear, along with other necessary ingredients, a tornado is possible.

What are the weather conditions during a tornado?
-------------------------------------------------

Basically, a tornado is formed when varying temperature and humidity come together and result in formation of thunderclouds. Conditions: cold and dry conditions in upper atmosphere and warm and moist conditions in the lower atmosphere, which are most suitable for the formation of tornadoes, are most often observed,…

What is the weather like in a tornado?
--------------------------------------

A tornado is a powerful column of winds that rotate around a center of low pressure. The winds inside a tornado spiral inward and upward, often exceeding speeds of 300 mph. For a thunderstorm to produce a tornado requires warm humid air near the surface with cold dry air above.

What states have tornadoes?
---------------------------

About 1,000 tornadoes hit the United States every year. Most of these touch down in America’s Plains states, an area known as Tornado Alley, which is generally considered to be Oklahoma, Kansas, the Texas Panhandle, Nebraska, eastern South Dakota, and eastern Colorado.

What happens before a tornado?
------------------------------

Before a tornado actually appears or arrives, hail usually tumbles to the ground. The hail is often the size of golf balls but may be smaller. Before the tornado inflicts its damage, initial damage is often done by hail striking roofs and other parts of houses, vehicles and street signs.
