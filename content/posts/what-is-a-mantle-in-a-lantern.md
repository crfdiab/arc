What is a mantle in a lantern?
------------------------------

The mantles are a ceramic mesh that encase the flame produced by the lantern. Mantles start out as silk fabric sacks impregnated with different oxides. The standard for decades has been the Welsbach mantle, which uses a mixture of thorium oxide, cerium oxide and magnesium oxide.

Do Coleman lanterns attract bugs?
---------------------------------

Went out fishing for cats all last night on the Snake River in ID with my Coleman lantern. It puts out a ton of light, but the drawback is that it draws bugs like crazy.

Are thorium mantles dangerous?
------------------------------

One potential cause for concern is that particles from thorium gas mantles “fall out” over time and get into the air, where they may be ingested in food or drink. These particles may also be inhaled and remain in the lungs or liver, causing long-term exposure exceeding the risk of background radiation.

How long do Coleman mantles last?
---------------------------------

How long does one of these last? Answer: They should last a lot longer than 3-5 burns, but they do become brittle after first use.

Can you use a lantern without a globe?
--------------------------------------

In passing: The lantern can be operated without a globe. I would hesitate to use it in adverse weather. The mantles are fragile and a strong wind or a raindrop can do them in, but for inside or on calm evenings, they are quite usable.

What can be used as a lantern mantle?
-------------------------------------

Things You’ll Need The mantle is usually made from artificial silk or rayon fabric. The fabric is completely soaked with an earth oxide. Thorium is an example of a rare earth oxide that can be used to saturate the fabric. The mantle is then placed inside of the lantern.

Are Coleman lanterns safe?
--------------------------

ANSWER: Burning any fossil fuel indoors is potentially dangerous. Coleman lanterns burn fossil fuel and if used indoors create the potential for a fatal buildup of carbon monoxide. For this reason, Coleman strongly urges consumers to use its lanterns only outdoors.

Are old Coleman lanterns safe?
------------------------------

Especially if you know little or nothing about the lamp or lantern, you must confirm that it is safe. Look for damp spots on and under the fuel tank and test the function of each control. Never loosen the fuel filler cap while the lamp/lantern is burning. Turn the appliance off and allow it to cool first.

Are lantern mantles still radioactive?
--------------------------------------

The mantles in such lamps are actually radioactive . . . The mantles used on modern lanterns acquire their radioactive properties during the manufacturing process. First, the fabric that will eventually form the small rayon mesh pouches is dipped into a solution of thorium and cerium nitrates.

Do Coleman mantles have thorium?
--------------------------------

Sometime around 1990, the Coleman Company replaced the thorium in their mantles with yttrium. The yttrium mantle produces about 20% less light, but it lasts longer.

Do lantern mantles expire?
--------------------------

Well, with normal use (being, I suppose, five hours per night) I would fully expect a mantle to last a month at least. As for transporting, depends on how much it gets jarred. They are definitely not durable when being banged around.

Can you light a Coleman lantern without mantles?
------------------------------------------------

You can’t light the lamp without fuel. You are better off using Coleman fuel, though various other options can work just as effectively.

What makes a good camping lantern for camping?
----------------------------------------------

Also, since the lantern has a battery indicator, you’ll never be too late or too early when changing the batteries, which is what sets this one apart as one of a top choice lantern for camping. Even with little to no light, changing the batteries is easy with the aid of the keyed battery door.

What do you need to know about knots for camping?
-------------------------------------------------

Knowing a few basic knots for camping will enable you to secure tarps and shelters, fasten guy lines on tents, tie down gear on the car and fix up lines for drying washing or hanging lanterns.

What kind of light source does a lantern have?
----------------------------------------------

A lantern generally contains a burning light source: a candle, liquid oil with a wick, or gas with a mantle.

Where to put a mosquito net for camping?
----------------------------------------

The bottom can be tucked under the mattress to make sure mosquitos stay outside of your “safe zone”. This net by Universal Backpackers comes in a sturdy circular carry bag with a hanging kit included so that you don’t need anything else to stay protected during the night.
