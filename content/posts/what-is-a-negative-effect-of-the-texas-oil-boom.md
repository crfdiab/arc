What is a negative effect of the Texas oil boom?
------------------------------------------------

Although petrochemicals provided many important benefits to the Texas economy and the public, their production raised environmental concerns. The processes used to separate these chemicals from oil created tons of toxic waste each year. They also released cancer-causing fumes and gases into the air.

What effects did the oil industry have on Texas?
------------------------------------------------

The oil industry brought opportunities to Texans. Texas became the center of oil exploration and production in the nation. Many rural areas grew into cities. New types of jobs were created, and people had more time to enjoy leisure activities such as baseball.

What was the price of oil in the Texas oil boom?
------------------------------------------------

The overabundance of supply led oil prices in the U.S. to drop to a record low of 3 cents per barrel, less than the price of water in some areas. Beaumont almost instantly became a boomtown with investors from around the state and the nation participating in land speculation.

Why are oil prices so negative in Alberta?
------------------------------------------

And so Alberta oil prices have become negative in the sense that the benchmark price is now lower than the cost of production, transport and storage. This state of affairs cannot be expected to last for long.

How does the price of oil affect the United States?
---------------------------------------------------

Greater domestic oil production is a net positive for the United States. However, as an oil-producing country (and not just an oil consumer), the United States now also feels an unpleasant pinch when oil prices drop. The price of oil influences the costs of other production and manufacturing across the United States.

Why is Texas leading the way in oil production?
-----------------------------------------------

Texas is leading the way in a massive boom in U.S. oil production: oil exports are higher than theyâ€™ve been since the 1950s, when the Suez Canal crisis caused a brief jump in shipments. Imports have dropped significantly, but even with that decline, Americans still import about a fourth of the oil they use.
