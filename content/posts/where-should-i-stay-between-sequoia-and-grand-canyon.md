    Which park is better Yellowstone or Yosemite?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    If you must choose between the two national parks, some things you should consider are: Yosemite is only a 3-hour drive from San Fransisco, and is much more accessible than Yellowstone. Yellowstone is vast and serene with more wildlife. Yosemite has more waterfalls and a stunningly rugged landscape.

    Where is the best place to see the giant sequoias?
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    Massive, ancient giant sequoias live in three groves in Yosemite National Park. The most easily accessible of these (spring through fall) is the Mariposa Grove near the park’s South Entrance, off of the Wawona Road (Highway 41). Two smaller—and less visited—groves are the Tuolumne and Merced Groves near Crane Flat.
    
    What’s the difference between redwoods and sequoias?
    ----------------------------------------------------
    
    —The giant sequoia is the largest tree in the world in volume and has an immense trunk with very slight taper; the redwood is the world’s tallest tree and has a slender trunk. —The wood of the giant sequoia is much coarser in texture than that of the redwood, and growth rings of the redwood are wider.
