What type of volcanic material appears black?
---------------------------------------------

Basaltic lava solidifies into a black rock called basalt (Figs 5.3 &amp; 5.4) with a high content of mafic minerals.

What is the black stuff on lava called?
---------------------------------------

It erupts non-explosively and moves very quickly when it reaches Earth’s surface as lava. This lava cools into basalt, a rock that is heavy and dark in color due to its higher iron and magnesium levels. Basalt is one of the most common rocks in Earth’s crust as well as the volcanic islands created by hot spots.

What do the particles of a volcano look like?
---------------------------------------------

Coarse particles of volcanic ash look and feel like grains of sand, while very fine particles are powder y. Particles are sometimes called tephra —which actually refers to all solid material eject ed by volcanoes. Ash is a product of explosive volcanic eruption s. When gases inside a volcano’s magma chamber expand,…

What kind of glass is found in a volcano?
-----------------------------------------

Obsidian is silicic volcanic glass that has undergone minimal crystallization, and has been documented in volcanic products spanning rhyolitic to phonolitic compositions. Although most abundant within lava flows, obsidian is also found in volcanic bombs and shallow intrusion margins.

What kind of particles are in volcanic ash?
-------------------------------------------

Particles less than 2 mm in diameter are called volcanic ash. Volcanic ash consists of small mineral grains and glass. Figure 11.16 shows volcanic ash on three scales: in the upper left is ash from the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland. The image was taken with a scanning electron microscope at approximately 1000 times magnification.

What kind of materials are produced by a volcanic eruption?
-----------------------------------------------------------

2 Materials Produced by Volcanic Eruptions Volcanic eruptions produce three types of materials: gas, lava, and fragmented debris called tephra. Volcanic Gas. Magma contains gas. At high pressures, the gases are dissolved within magma. However, if the pressure decreases, the gas comes out of solution, forming bubbles.
