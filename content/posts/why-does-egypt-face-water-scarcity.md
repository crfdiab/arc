Why does Egypt face water scarcity?
-----------------------------------

Egypt has been suffering from severe water scarcity in recent years. Uneven water distribution, misuse of water resources and inefficient irrigation techniques are some of the major factors playing havoc with water security in the country. Egypt is facing an annual water deficit of around 7 billion cubic metres.

Does Egypt have enough water?
-----------------------------

Water resources Egypt’s main source of freshwater is the Nile River. The river supplies 56.8 billion m³ of freshwater every year, which represents 97% of all renewable water resources in Egypt. Since 2005, Egypt is classified as a water scarce country as it has less than 1000 m³ of fresh water per year per capita.

How can we save water in Egypt?
-------------------------------

\*\* Strip irrigation: Egyptian farmers traditionally irrigate their fields by flooding or by supplying water through furrows. Strip irrigation applies water through furrows at wider intervals, i.e., a reduced number of furrows. We can expect to save up to 20% to 30% of the water for irrigation in the Nile Delta.

What are the issues of water scarcity in Egypt?
-----------------------------------------------

The two-day-conference tackles many water issues including the mechanisms used to benefit most from available water resources, water desalination, and the challenges of climate change, sustainable management for irrigation, investments in different water fields, ways to use renewable energy in irrigations and the spread of awareness about water.

Why is Egypt worried about the Nile River?
------------------------------------------

This creates major concern for Egypt, who is worried that this damn would decrease the amount of water it receives (55.5 billion cubic meters) from the Nile River. Egypt is concerned that during dry months, not enough water will be released from the GERD thus decreasing the water received downstream.

How is Egypt coping with the water crisis?
------------------------------------------

Despite the latest negotiations between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan to resolve the technical issues of the dam, Egypt is keen to look for new sources of water and to rationalize its usage to overcome any water scarcity problems in the future. Wastewater management is one of negotiable mitigation means to ease the crisis.

How much water does Egypt get in a year?
----------------------------------------

Egypt receives less than 80 mm of rainfall a year, and only 6 percent of the country is arable and agricultural land, with the rest being desert. This leads to excessive watering and the use of wasteful irrigation techniques such as flood irrigation \[an outdated method of irrigation where gallons of water are pumped over the crops\].
