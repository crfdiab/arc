How many invasive species are in the Great Lakes?
-------------------------------------------------

180 species  
Scientists estimate the Great Lakes have been invaded by more than 180 species.

How are invasive species affecting Lake Michigan?
-------------------------------------------------

Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) threaten the health and vitality of Michigan’s Great Lakes and inland waters. AIS compete with native species for food and habitat, disrupt aquatic food webs, impact water quality and cost the state millions.

What has caused damage to ecosystems in the Great Lakes?
--------------------------------------------------------

Threats to the Great Lakes’ ecosystems, include invasive species, climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. Climate change affects water temperatures, weather patterns, and lake levels. Pollutants from residential, agricultural, and industrial areas reduce water quality.

Where are zebra mussels in Michigan?
------------------------------------

Zebra Mussel

- Identification:
- Habitat: Freshwater lakes, rivers, and reservoirs.
- Diet: Mussels are filter feeders that consume algae and phytoplankton in the water.
- Native Range: Zebra mussels are native to freshwater rivers and lakes in Eastern Europe and western Asia.

What kind of ecosystem is the Great Lakes?
------------------------------------------

The Great Lakes are complex ecosystems. There is a natural coupling between river and Great Lakes systems. Many species and species assemblages or communities are co-adapted to features of these complex and coupled systems. Lake sturgeon are members of a group of species referred to as “Benthivores”.

What kind of animals live in the Great Lakes?
---------------------------------------------

The Great Lakes constitute the largest freshwater ecosystem in the world. The basin is home to 3,500 species of plants and animals, including Canada Lynx, Gray Wolves, and Bald Eagles, and over 170 species of fish.

How are invasive species affecting the Great Lakes ecosystem?
-------------------------------------------------------------

These “invaders” take the niches and habitats of native species. This may cause a loss of biodiversity in the ecosystem. An example would be the invasive species, zebra mussels, causing native clam species to go extinct or be endangered. Invasive species may also alter beaches and fisheries (National Wildlife Federation).

Are there any non native species in the Great Lakes?
----------------------------------------------------

Zebra mussels, quagga mussels, sea lampreys, alewive, and asian carps are all present in the Great Lakes, but are not native to this area. Another non-native species is the spiny water flea in Lake Ontario. How they got there? Approximately 180 non-native species “invaded” the Great Lakes ecosystem in the late 19th century (Klappenbach, 2013).
