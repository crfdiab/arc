What do scientists learn about Neptune?
---------------------------------------

By figuring out where Neptune was born and how the planet evolved, scientists learn what conditions in the early solar system were like, around the time life arose on Earth. Neptune has 14 known moons, half of which were likely captured by the planet’s gravity rather than forming in place.

Why do scientists think Neptune is warmer than Uranus?
------------------------------------------------------

“Yet that unusual result is associated with the fact that Uranus does not have a significant internal heat source.” Neptune is finding a way to warm itself up to the level of Uranus, while the latter is unable to generate any extra heat other than that gleaned from the sun.

Do scientists believe that Neptune can support life?
----------------------------------------------------

To find life on Neptune, the planet would need to have a source of energy that bacterial life can exploit, as well as a standing source of liquid water. Right now, scientists don’t know if there’s any life on Neptune, and the conditions on the planet seem very hostile for life. It’s unlikely we’ll ever find any there.

10 Interesting Facts About Neptune

- Neptune is the Most Distant Planet:
- Neptune is the Smallest of the Gas Giants:
- Neptune’s Surface Gravity is Almost Earth-like:
- The Discovery of Neptune is Still a Controversy:
- Neptune has the Strongest Winds in the Solar System:
- Neptune is the Coldest Planet in the Solar System:

Why do scientists want to know why Neptune has so much heat?
------------------------------------------------------------

Simon said scientists want to know why Neptune generates such heat, because this affects weather processes on the planet.

How did Neptune get knocked out of the Solar System?
----------------------------------------------------

During the solar system’s infancy 4.5 billion years ago, they say, the giant planet was knocked out of the planet-forming region near the sun. Slowed down by gas, the planet settled into a distant elliptical orbit, where it still lurks today. The claim is the strongest yet in the centuries-long search for a “Planet X” beyond Neptune.

When was the planet Neptune supposed to be found?
-------------------------------------------------

In 1846, for example, the French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier predicted the existence of a giant planet from irregularities in the orbit of Uranus. Astronomers at the Berlin Observatory found the new planet, Neptune, where it was supposed to be, sparking a media sensation.

How are scientists able to see Neptune from space?
--------------------------------------------------

Until another spacecraft can get out there, scientists must rely on ground-based telescopes such as Keck II, and space-based observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the Kepler space telescope, to get occasional glimpses of Neptune in between their other duties. This leaves a lot of unanswered questions about the blue planet.
