What are some space tools?
--------------------------

Below are a few of the tools used to construct the International Space Station, one of the most challenging feats of engineering ever attempted.

1. Pistol-Grip Tool. The main tool used by spacewalkers is this 21st century hand-drill, built by Swales Aerospace Inc.
2. Robot Crane.
3. Trace Gas Analyzer.
4. Safety Tethers.

What are the common tools used in space exploration?
----------------------------------------------------

Earth-Based Observations.

6. Airborne and Orbital Telescopes.
7. Probes and Fly-by Spacecraft.
8. Orbiters.
9. Landers.
10. Rovers.
11. Sample Return. What does NASA use instead of space shuttles?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    Orion is NASA’s new spacecraft, built to take humans farther into space than they’ve ever gone before. It will carry the crew to space, provide emergency abort capability, sustain the crew and provide a safe return to Earth.
    
    What equipment do astronauts use in space?
    ------------------------------------------
    
    The International Space Station is equipped with three machines designed to give astronauts that full-body workout: a bicycle, a treadmill, and a weightlifting machine called ARED, for Advanced Resistive Exercise Device.
    
    Do they wear a special suit in space why?
    -----------------------------------------
    
    A spacesuit protects astronauts from those extreme temperatures. Spacesuits also supply astronauts with oxygen to breathe while they are in the vacuum of space. They contain water to drink during spacewalks. They protect astronauts from being injured from impacts of small bits of space dust.
    
    What is space tool?
    -------------------
    
    The space label is drawn using a pre-defined or user-defined symbol, can display not only name and number, but virtually any desired information. Space objects automatically calculate their area, volume, and perimeter.
    
    What kind of space suits do they use?
    -------------------------------------
    
    Full- (Body) Pressure-suits can be either Low-Pressure (pure oxygen at 32.4 kPa) or High-Pressure (breathing mix at 101.3 kPa, normal Terran atmospheric pressure). All NASA spacecraft and space station habitat modules are High-Pressure. At least the ones designed after the Apollo 1 tragedy claimed the lives of three astronauts.
    
    What kind of device do astronauts use in space?
    -----------------------------------------------
    
    NASA has also developed some gas-powered rocket maneuvering devices to allow astronauts to move freely in space without being tethered to the spacecraft. One such device, which was called the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), was basically a gas-thruster powered chair with a joystick control.
    
    Are there any alternatives to an expendable rocket?
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    A number of alternatives to expendable rockets have been proposed. In some systems such as a combination launch system, skyhook, rocket sled launch, rockoon, or air launch, a rocket would be part, but only part of the system used to reach orbit.
    
    How are SpaceX’s sleek spacesuit changes astronaut fashion?
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    
    The SpaceX spacesuits are a cool, one-piece white design, and much sleeker than the bulky space shuttle launch suits, which were also known as the Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES).
