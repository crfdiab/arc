Can cyclones cause tidal waves?
-------------------------------

While significant surges usually accompany tropical cyclones, storm surges caused by large low-pressure systems can also bring dangerous storm tides and damage to coastal communities all around Australia.

What is an example of a tidal wave?
-----------------------------------

A tidal wave is a shallow water wave caused by the gravitational interactions between the Sun, Moon, and Earth (“tidal wave” was used in earlier times to describe what we now call a tsunami.) Tsunamis and Tsunami Hazards. Tsunami and Earthquake Research.

Which wave is also called storm waves?
--------------------------------------

A tidal wave/storm surge is the rise of the water level in the sea, an estuary or lake as result of strong wind driving the seawater towards the coast. This so-called wind setup is superimposed on the normal astronomical tide. The mean high water level can be exceeded by five and more metres.

What are tidal waves?
---------------------

A tidal wave is a shallow water wave caused by the gravitational interactions between the Sun, Moon, and Earth. The term “tidal wave” is often used to refer to tsunamis; however, this reference is incorrect as tsunamis have nothing to do with tides.

Are waves big after a storm?
----------------------------

“Because the storm surge increases the water’s depth near the shore, the waves generated by the wind can now propagate on deeper water, and larger waves and wave breaking can occur nearer to the shore than would occur without the hurricane.”

What is bigger tidal wave or tsunami?
-------------------------------------

Tidal waves are waves created by the gravitational forces of the sun or moon, and cause changes in the level of water bodies. Tsunami is a series of water waves caused by the displacement of large bodies of water. They generally have low amplitude but a high (a few hundred km long) wavelength.

What is considered a high wave height?
--------------------------------------

If we take a sample forecast of Seas Beyond the Reef of 2 to 4 feet, this implies that the average of the highest one-third waves will have a Significant Wave Height of 2 to 4 feet. considered in describing sea state.

How are tidal waves and storm surges related?
---------------------------------------------

A tidal wave/storm surge is the rise of the water level in the sea, an estuary or lake as result of strong wind driving the seawater towards the coast. This so-called wind setup is superimposed on the normal astronomical tide.

How is a winter storm related to a tropical cyclone?
----------------------------------------------------

A winter storm emerges from a extra-tropical cyclone, a synoptic scale low pressure system that occurs in the middle latitudes of the Earth and is connected to fronts and horizontal gradients in temperature and dew point. A winter storm comes along with high wind speeds, gusts, thunderstorms, rain and often storm surges.

Where do most tsunamis and tidal waves occur?
---------------------------------------------

A majority of tsunamis (80%) occur in the Pacific Ocean but can occur in any large body of water if the underlying causes are present. Tidal waves occur on a daily basis in most coastal area, whereas tsunamis occur as when there is seismic disturbance in large water bodies.

What’s the difference between a typhoon and a tropical cyclone?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The term “typhoon” is used when the weather system originates over the Northwest Pacific Ocean. The term “cyclone” is used when the weather system originates over the South Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean. Meteorologists officially use the umbrella term “Tropical Cyclone” to cover all three systems regardless of their location.
