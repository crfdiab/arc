Is it safe to take shelter in a car during a tornado?
-----------------------------------------------------

There is no safe option when caught in a tornado in a car, just slightly less-dangerous ones. If the tornado is visible, far away, and the traffic is light, you may be able to drive out of its path by moving at right angles to the tornado. Seek shelter in a sturdy building, or underground if possible.

When should you seek shelter from a tornado?
--------------------------------------------

If a tornado has been spotted or indicated by weather radar, you need to seek shelter immediately. Of course, the safest place to be when a tornado approaches is in a basement or storm shelter underground. But if you are not able to get to a shelter or basement, you need to find shelter that is available.

Is a car safer than a house in a tornado?
-----------------------------------------

The theory that opening house windows can equalize pressure and prevent damage is a myth. You could be wasting valuable time getting to shelter. You are not any safer in a car than in a mobile home during a tornado. Avoid both and determine another safe place for your family.

What should you do if you are in a car during a tornado?
--------------------------------------------------------

In a vehicle: Being in a vehicle during a tornado is not safe. The best course of action is to drive to the closest shelter. If you are unable to make it to a safe shelter, either get down in your car and cover your head, or abandon your car and seek shelter in a low lying area such as a ditch or ravine.

Is it safe to leave your home during a tornado?
-----------------------------------------------

Generally speaking, you should not leave your home in your vehicle when a tornado threatens. In most cases, you will have a better chance of surviving by staying put in your home. Every home is different â€“ there is no absolute safe place in every home.

What do you need to know about tornado shelters?
------------------------------------------------

Safe Rooms A reinforced safe room (or above-ground tornado shelter) is as good as an underground shelter in most situations. Safe rooms are specially-designed reinforced tornado shelters built into homes, schools and other buildings.

What to do if your mobile home is destroyed by a tornado?
---------------------------------------------------------

Taking cover under sturdy furniture, in a bathtub or closet or under a mattress will be meaningless in a mobile home if the home itself is destroyed, blown over, or rolled over by tornado or severe thunderstorm winds. Get out of mobile homes and find a more substantial shelter as quickly as possible.
