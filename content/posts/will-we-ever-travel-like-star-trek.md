Will we ever travel like Star Trek?
-----------------------------------

If humanity ever wants to travel easily between stars, people will need to go faster than light. But so far, faster-than-light travel is possible only in science fiction. In Issac Asimov’s Foundation series, humanity can travel from planet to planet, star to star or across the universe using jump drives.

How does space travel work in Star Trek?
----------------------------------------

Warp drive was a technology that allowed space travel at faster-than-light speeds. It worked by generating warp fields to form a subspace bubble that enveloped the starship, distorting the local spacetime continuum and moving the starship at velocities that could greatly exceed the speed of light.

Will humans ever travel beyond our solar system?
------------------------------------------------

The technology required to travel between galaxies is far beyond humanity’s present capabilities, and currently only the subject of speculation, hypothesis, and science fiction. However, theoretically speaking, there is nothing to conclusively indicate that intergalactic travel is impossible.

How close are we to FTL travel?
-------------------------------

It is about 4.25 light-years away, or about 25 trillion miles (40 trillion km). The fastest ever spacecraft, the now-in-space Parker Solar Probe will reach a top speed of 450,000 miles (724,000 km) per hour.

Are there any episodes of Star Trek that have time travel?
----------------------------------------------------------

This list includes all episodes the television series and the movies with time travel plots, from the original series through to ‘The Next Generation’, ‘Deep Space Nine’ and ‘Voyager’, as well as the movies and the latest incarnation, ‘Discovery’.

How does the transporter work in Star Trek?
-------------------------------------------

It’s one of the most famous lines in the “Star Trek” franchise and refers to the futuristic matter transportation device or “transporter” on every ship in the galaxy. The transporter dematerializes entire humans (and other objects) and sends their constituent particles to another destination where they are perfectly reassembled.

How long would it take to travel to Mars in Star Trek?
------------------------------------------------------

The numbers get a little wiggly, owing to the constant movement of the two involved planets, but a crewed trip to Mars, using current technology, would take about nine months. That’s quite a road trip. The point is, there’s a whole lot of space out there and getting anywhere interesting takes way too long.

Are there any movies that use sound in outer space?
---------------------------------------------------

The short-lived television series “Firefly” avoided using sound effects for exterior space shots. But many movies, such as the “Star Wars” and “Star Trek” series, have dozens of scenes that combine action in outer space with nifty sound effects.
