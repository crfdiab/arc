How are the 3 types of boundaries different?
--------------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseDivergent boundaries — where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other. Convergent boundaries — where crust is destroyed as one plate dives under another. Transform boundaries — where crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other.

Are the three different types of convergent plate boundaries?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseConvergent boundaries , where two plates are moving toward each other, are of three types, depending on the type of crust present on either side of the boundary — oceanic or continental . The types are ocean-ocean, ocean-continent, and continent-continent.

How many convergent boundary types are there and what are the differences between the different convergent boundary types?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseWhen two tectonic plates move toward each other and collide, they form a convergent plate boundary. There are three types of convergent plate boundaries: oceanic-oceanic boundaries, oceanic-continental boundaries, and continental-continental boundaries. Each one is unique because of the density of the plates involved.

What are the three types of convergent plate boundaries?
--------------------------------------------------------

• There are three types of convergent plate boundaries: oceanic-oceanic boundaries, oceanic-continental boundaries, and continental-continental boundaries. Each one is unique because of the density of the plates involved. • Convergent plate boundaries are often the sites of earthquakes, volcanoes, and other significant geological activity.

What’s the difference between convergent and transform plates?
--------------------------------------------------------------

CONVERGENT PLATES: Convergent plates push boundaries together. TRANSFORM (CONSERVATIVE) PLATES: Conservative (transform) plate boundaries slide across from each other. Now, let’s take a look at each type of tectonic plate boundary in a bit more detail. Like seams of a baseball, tectonic plate boundaries wrap around the Earth.

What happens to the crust at a convergent boundary?
---------------------------------------------------

Thus, at convergent boundaries, continental crust is created and oceanic crust is destroyed. Two plates sliding past each other forms a transform plate boundary. Natural or human-made structures that cross a transform boundary are offset—split into pieces and carried in opposite directions.

How are earthquakes different from convergent and divergent boundaries?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As the plates alternately jam and jump against each other, earthquakes rattle through a wide boundary zone. In contrast to convergent and divergent boundaries, no magma is formed. Thus, crust is cracked and broken at transform margins, but is not created or destroyed.
