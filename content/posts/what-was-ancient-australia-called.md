What was ancient Australia called?
----------------------------------

the Prehistory of Australia  
Ancient Australia (also called the Prehistory of Australia), covers the time from when the first humans came to Australia to the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788. Aboriginal artefacts on Rottnest Island have been dated from 6,500 to more than 30,000 years ago.

Are the aboriginal people the oldest people on earth?
-----------------------------------------------------

\[Australian Aboriginal people\] are probably the oldest group in the world that you can link to one particular place. Another study found that a primitive group of humans descended from the Neanderthals and migrated from Siberia to tropical parts of Asia.

When did the first humans come to Australia?

Where did the ancient Australians find their land?
--------------------------------------------------

In the vicinity of Panama and south of it, but seperated by his east-west ocean, he placed “Antipodes” which now is South America. His fourth land mass, balancing out the other continents and situated below what we now call the Indian ocean, he described “Antoeci”, now known as Australia.

When did the first Aboriginal people come to Australia?
-------------------------------------------------------

Aboriginal artefacts on Rottnest Island have been dated from 6,500 to more than 30,000 years ago. However, more recent evidence suggests human occupation by or even before 50,000 years ago. During the Pleistocene period, sea levels were much lower than they are today.
