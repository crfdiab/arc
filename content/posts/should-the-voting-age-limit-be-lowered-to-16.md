Should the voting age limit be lowered to 16?
---------------------------------------------

A key argument put forward in favour of lowering the voting age is that the younger someone engages with the electoral process, the greater the chance they will become lifelong voters. Research shows that voting is habitual. Roughly 75% of 16- and 17-year-olds voted in the Scottish referendum.
