What is in a ocean habitat?
---------------------------

Ocean habitats can be divided into two: coastal and open ocean habitats. Ocean and coastal habitats can be created by species living in them. Corals, kelp, mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses are the “eco-engineers” of the coasts. They reshape the marine environment to create habitats for other organisms.

What can be found in the ocean?
-------------------------------

Marine invertebrates include sea slugs, sea anemones, starfish, octopi, clams, sponges, sea worms, crabs, and lobsters. Most of these animals are found close to the shore, but they can be found throughout the ocean. Fish are vertebrates; they have a backbone.

What kind of habitat does the ocean have?
-----------------------------------------

Ocean Habitat. Overview. Oceans contain the greatest diversity of life on Earth. From the freezing polar regions to the warm waters of the tropics and deep sea hydrothermal vents to shallow seagrass beds, marine organisms abound. Humans rely on the oceans for their important natural resources.

What kind of animals live in different habitats?
------------------------------------------------

Some animals, like whales, sea turtles and fish may occupy several zones throughout their lives or in different seasons. Other animals, like sessile barnacles, may stay in one zone for most of their lives. Major Habitats in the Ocean Habitats in the ocean range from warm, shallow, light-filled waters to deep, dark, cold areas.

How are animals adapted to live in the ocean?
---------------------------------------------

The resources are also available at the top of the page. The ocean has three broad habitats: the intertidal zone, the pelagic zone, and the abyss. Water depth, temperature, and the presence or absence of light are some of the conditions that differ in these habitats. Animals adapt to their environments to help them survive.
