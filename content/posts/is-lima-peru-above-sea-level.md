Is Lima Peru above sea level?
-----------------------------

Lima, for example, is about 505 feet (154 meters) above sea level at the Plaza de Armas (the main plaza), while Cerro San Cristóbal (the highest point in Lima) rises up to 1,312 feet (400 meters). That means that while certain cities may have low elevations listed, expect to change elevations as you travel.

Machu Picchu/Elevation

You may be wondering how the altitude at Machu Picchu will affect your visit. The site itself is not considered a high-altitude destination. The saddle of the mountain, where most of the ruins are located, is roughly 7,900 feet above sea level—about 3,300 feet lower than Cusco and 1,600 feet below the Sacred Valley.

How do you prepare for Machu Picchu high altitude?
--------------------------------------------------

4\. Go lower and acclimatise. Head straight to the lower altitude of the Sacred Valley or Machu Picchu. Believe it or not, Cusco is at an altitude of 3400m (11,154ft) so heading to Pisac or Urubamba at 2,900m (9,514ft) or Machu Picchu at 2,400m (7,874ft) can make a huge difference.

Lima, for example, is about 505 feet (154 meters) above sea level at the Plaza de Armas (the main plaza), while Cerro San Cristóbal (the highest point in Lima) rises up to 1,312 feet (400 meters). The table also includes altitudes for some of Peru’s most popular tourist attractions.

How tall is the city of Puno in Peru?

You can see in the table above, Cusco and Puno are two cities ( lake Titicaca is at Puno) with more than 10,000 ft height. Other cities are not really that high. Many of the cities in USA are at above 5,000 ft elevation.

How long does it take to acclimate to altitude in Peru?
-------------------------------------------------------

Many tour agencies try to organize the tour looking in such a way so that you can acclimatize while enjoying the tour. If you are planning a tour of longer time, 2/3 weeks, you must move from cities of lower elevation to cities of higher elevation. Like from Arequipa and at the end Lake Titicaca, Puno.
