What does a 1 earthquake feel like?
-----------------------------------

A small earthquake nearby will feel like a small sharp jolt followed by a few stronger sharp shakes that pass quickly. A small earthquake far away will probably not be felt at all, but if you do feel it, it will be a subtle gentle shake or two that is easier to feel if you’re still and sitting down.

Where do earthquakes usually hit?
---------------------------------

Over 90% of earthquakes – including almost all of the largest and most destructive ones – happen at or near so-called plate boundaries, where the 15 or so major subdivisions (“plates”) of the Earth’s crust and uppermost mantle move towards, alongside, or away from each other.

Do people fall in earthquake cracks?
------------------------------------

So when imagining an opening crack during an earthquake, it would be wrong to think of a crack that penetrates very deep. It is a tiny opening and if you fall in, it is very likely that you will be squished into it due to hydrostatic pressure. You could get squished, you could fall deeper.

How does an earthquake happen on the Earth?
-------------------------------------------

Earthquakes happen when the boundaries of the Earth’s tectonic plates bump and slide past one another; sometimes, they get stuck on jagged edges and cause earthquakes once they are released.

Is there any way to tell when an earthquake is going to happen?
---------------------------------------------------------------

By measuring the amount of time between events, they can come up with a rough idea of when a major quake might hit. Cycles can stretch for hundreds of years–it may be 600 years (or more or less) between major earthquakes along a fault–but there’s no way to truly know if or when the next big quake will occur.

What happens to your home during an earthquake?
-----------------------------------------------

By planning and practicing what to do if an earthquake strikes, you and your family can learn to react correctly and automatically when the shaking begins. During an earthquake, most deaths and injuries are caused by collapsing building materials and heavy falling objects, such as bookcases, cabinets, and heating units.

How does an earthquake cause a seismograph to shake?
----------------------------------------------------

The seismograph has a base that sets firmly in the ground, and a heavy weight that hangs free. When an earthquake causes the ground to shake, the base of the seismograph shakes too, but the hanging weight does not. Instead the spring or string that it is hanging from absorbs all the movement.
