Why are they digging in Antarctica?
-----------------------------------

Drilling into the ice of Antarctica is like going back in time. Their aim is to extract ice cores that will help them to piece together what happened to our planet’s climate during a crucial and mysterious period of change that occurred around 1 million years ago.

Should there be mining in Antarctica?
-------------------------------------

There has never been any commercial mining in Antarctica thanks to the Antarctic Treaty which has completely banned mining under the Environmental Protocol. In 1989, France and Australia refused to sign the convention, saying that no mining should be allowed to take place in Antarctica – period.

Can you drill in Antarctica?
----------------------------

They aim to drill the first 150 metres into the ice over the next Antarctic summer between November 2020 and January 2021. As they drill down, the team will pump a thick, non-toxic fluid into the resulting borehole to prevent the pressure of the ice sheet from closing it up.

Is there a staircase in Antarctica from Google Earth?
-----------------------------------------------------

Since then, people have been scouring Google Earth images of Antarctica and discovering some surprising things. The Antarctic “staircase” found last year. While most of these have been written off as simply natural ice or rock formations, that hasn’t stopped YouTube detectives from digging up more Antarctic mysteries using Google Earth.

Why did they need to go to Antarctica?
--------------------------------------

The polar researcher needed access to the purest, most isolated tracts of Antarctica in order to fully test her hypothesis that tiny particles of man made plastic, less than 5 millimeter in size, might have made their way even into this pristine environment, highlighting the impact humans can have on the environment.

How did they get the minerals in Antarctica?
--------------------------------------------

But getting to them would have required battling the hazardous Antarctic conditions. Miners would have had to get through the thick ice sheet to reach the minerals. Antarctica is also a long way from world markets. Mined minerals would have had to be shipped over the treacherous Southern Ocean.

Why do you have to be roped together in Antarctica?
---------------------------------------------------

And that’s important in an environment like Antarctica when you need to eat up to five meals a day to replace all the calories your body is using just to stay warm.” For safety reasons, expeditioners have to be roped together when out in the field.
