What is causing the depths of the earthquakes to change?
--------------------------------------------------------

The most prominent example of this is in subduction zones, where plates are colliding and one plate is being subducted beneath another. As the slab descends into the mantle, rheology changes (viscosity characteristics) cause the plate to bend and deform, and generates these earthquakes.

What causes deep-focus earthquakes?
-----------------------------------

They are caused by the collision and subduction of the Indian Plate under the Eurasian Plate, the deepest earthquakes centered on the furthest subducted sections of the plate.

What is the depth of focus for earthquakes at subduction zones?
---------------------------------------------------------------

In subduction zones, where older and colder oceanic crust sinks under another tectonic plate, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths in the mantle, ranging from 300 km (190 mi) up to 700 km (430 mi).

What’s the typical depth of an earthquake focus?
------------------------------------------------

Shallow earthquakes are between 0 and 70 km deep; intermediate earthquakes, 70 – 300 km deep; and deep earthquakes, 300 – 700 km deep. In general, the term “deep-focus earthquakes” is applied to earthquakes deeper than 70 km.

What is the significance of the depth of an earthquake?
-------------------------------------------------------

The strength of shaking from an earthquake diminishes with increasing distance from the earthquake’s source, so the strength of shaking at the surface from an earthquake that occurs at 500km deep is considerably less than if the same earthquake had occurred at 20 km depth.

Are there shallow, intermediate, and deep earthquakes?
------------------------------------------------------

Shallow, intermediate, and deep foci. Most parts of the world experience at least occasional shallow earthquakes—those that originate within 60 km (40 miles) of the Earth’s outer surface. In fact, the great majority of earthquake foci are shallow.

How big are earthquakes in the subduction zone?
-----------------------------------------------

The plate boundary contact between two such plates generate very large, shallow subduction zone earthquakes such as the Sumatra 2004 M9.1 event, and the 2011 M9.0 Japan earthquake, and is only active to relatively shallow depths – approximately 60 km.

Where do earthquakes occur on the earth’s surface?
--------------------------------------------------

Earthquakes occur at the following three kinds of plate boundary: ocean ridges where the plates are pulled apart, margins where the plates scrape past one another, and margins where one plate is thrust under the other. Thus, we can predict the general regions on the earth’s surface where we can expect large earthquakes in the future.
