How does winter affect coral reefs?
-----------------------------------

“On a short time scale, the cold event was actually more harmful to the corals than an equivalent warming event, but over time, these corals were able to acclimate to the cold. Accordingly, the researchers found that the cold both disrupted the photosynthetic system of the symbionts and greatly reduced coral growth.

How will climate change affect coral reefs?
-------------------------------------------

When conditions such as the temperature change, corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, responsible for their colour. A spike of 1–2°C in ocean temperatures sustained over several weeks can lead to bleaching, turning corals white. If corals are bleached for prolonged periods, they eventually die.

Why is my coral turning white?
------------------------------

When water is too warm, corals will expel the algae (zooxanthellae) living in their tissues causing the coral to turn completely white. This is called coral bleaching. When a coral bleaches, it is not dead. Corals can survive a bleaching event, but they are under more stress and are subject to mortality.

What happens to coral reefs when the environment changes?
---------------------------------------------------------

But when the ocean environment changes—if it gets too hot, for instance—the coral stresses out and expels the algae. As the algae leaves, the coral fades until it looks like it’s been bleached. If the temperature stays high, the coral won’t let the algae back, and the coral will die. You can help protect coral reefs, too.

What’s the best temperature for a coral reef?
---------------------------------------------

1 The temperature of the water should not be below 20°C. The most favourable temperature for the growth of the coral reefs is between 23°C to 25°C. 2 Corals can survive only under saline conditions with an average salinity between 27% to 40%. 3 Coral reefs grow better in shallow water having a depth less than 50 m. …

When does bleaching of coral reefs take place?
----------------------------------------------

MARK EAKIN: No. Corals will bleach when temperatures get too high. That’s also the only time that we see these mass bleaching events that cover huge areas—lots of reefs in a region all at the same time bleaching because you’ve got this big warm water mass. You can get localized bleaching when water temperatures get too cold too fast.

What happens to coral when they break it up?
--------------------------------------------

They’re breaking up pieces of tissue to get rid of this, to slough it off. What happens is the coral is actually clear, the tissue of the coral is actually clear and that maximizes the light that can get through and get to the zooxanthellae, these symbiotic algae.
