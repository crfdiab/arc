Where was the Byzantine Empire located?
---------------------------------------

Where was the Byzantine Empire? At its greatest extent, the Byzantine Empire covered much of the land surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, including what is now Italy, Greece, and Turkey along with portions of North Africa and the Middle East.

Where is the capital of the Byzantine Empire located today?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Constantinople  
Constantinople is an ancient city in modern-day Turkey that’s now known as Istanbul. First settled in the seventh century B.C., Constantinople developed into a thriving port thanks to its prime geographic location between Europe and Asia and its natural harbor.

Why was Constantinople the capital of the Byzantine Empire?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Constantinople endured for more than 1,100 years as the Byzantine capital in large part due to the protective wall completed under Theodosius II in 413. Expanding the city perimeter west from Constantine’s wall by approximately a mile, the new one stretched 3-1/2 miles from the Sea of Marmara to the Golden Horn.

Who was the leader of the Byzantine Empire?

Is the Byzantine Empire the same as the Roman Empire?
-----------------------------------------------------

Both “Byzantine Empire” and “Eastern Roman Empire” are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire simply as the Roman Empire (Greek: Βασιλεία Ῥωμαίων, tr. Basileia Rhōmaiōn; Latin: Imperium Romanum), or Romania (Ῥωμανία), and to themselves as “Romans”.

What was the capital of the Roman Empire?
-----------------------------------------

However, Rome, which was the capital of the Roman Empire, was considered to be a hindrance to achieving these objectives as it was far from the empire’s frontiers, armies, and imperial courts. The empire identified Byzantium as an ideal location for a capital city and imperial residence.
