Licensed Childcare Home. In Texas, licensed childcare homes are open for fewer than 24 hours each day for seven to 12 children under the age of 14 in the licensee’s home. These homes are regularly inspected and monitored by the state. The process to become licensed requires the applicant to go through background checks and orientations.
