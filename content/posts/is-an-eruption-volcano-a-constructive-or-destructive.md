To scientists, volcanoes are known as “constructive” forces. That is, volcanoes often result in the construction of new landforms. “Destructive” forces are those like erosion or weathering in which landforms are broken down into smaller pieces like soil and sand.

Why is volcanoes a constructive force?
--------------------------------------

Volcanoes are both destructive and constructive forces. They are constructive because cooled lava is good for the soil. Volcanoes are destructive because the lava can start fires and burn things like houses, trees, and people.

What are the constructive effect?
---------------------------------

Unlike the destructive effects of earthquakes, in constructive effect, it assists the Earth in the freeing up of stored up energy that keeps the planet in an adequate structure. The movement of the earth’s crust can result in the formation of new landforms, like lakes, raising the lower-lying parts of the earth, etc.

Is the lava from a volcano constructive or destructive?
-------------------------------------------------------

They are constructive because cooled lava is good for the soil. Volcanoes are destructive because the lava can start fires and burn things like houses, trees, and people. Some forces are only constructive, while others are destructive. One may also ask, is wind constructive or destructive?

How are volcanoes a constructive force in the world?
----------------------------------------------------

Volcanoes are constructive forces in that they create new land, fertilize existing lands and bring many new minerals to the surface of the planet. Volcanoes also bring heat to the areas surrounding them and attract wildlife on land and beneath the sea.

Which is an example of a constructive force?
--------------------------------------------
