Are surface currents warm or cold?
----------------------------------

The global conveyor belt’s circulation is the result of two simultaneous processes: warm surface currents carrying less dense water away from the Equator toward the poles, and cold deep ocean currents carrying denser water away from the poles toward the Equator.

Do ocean currents affect surface temperature?
---------------------------------------------

Ocean water is constantly evaporating, increasing the temperature and humidity of the surrounding air to form rain and storms that are then carried by trade winds. Thus, ocean currents regulate global climate, helping to counteract the uneven distribution of solar radiation reaching Earth’s surface.

Are surface currents always warm?
---------------------------------

The surface ocean currents have a strong effect on Earth’s climate. However, these areas do not constantly get warmer and warmer, because the ocean currents and winds transport the heat from the lower latitudes near the equator to higher latitudes near the poles. …

Are ocean currents affected by unequal heating?
-----------------------------------------------

The different kinds of weather you might experience in these regions are caused by moving patterns in the Earth’s atmospheric and oceanic circulation, unequal heating of the Earth, and the rotation of the Earth on its tilted axis.

How are surface currents different from ocean currents?
-------------------------------------------------------

Water current is the movement of water from one place to another. Ocean currents are massive currents that are influenced by a variety of different forces that act to propel the water both on the surface and in deep ocean waters. Surface currents are found in the upper 1,300 feet of the ocean.

How does the temperature affect the ocean current?
--------------------------------------------------

Ocean Current Worksheet Temperature Affects and Surface Currents: Surface waters of the Earth’s oceans are forced to move, primarily by winds.

Why do deep water currents occur in the ocean?
----------------------------------------------

Deep water currents move the ocean water below 1,300 feet. Thermohaline circulation is caused by caused by differences in water temperature and salt content and the movement that is produced by these differences. As the heavy, colder water sinks and warmer, less dense water rises, water is moved throughout the entire ocean.

How are tides and wind related to ocean currents?
-------------------------------------------------

Tides contribute to coastal currents that travel short distances. Major surface ocean currents in the open ocean, however, are set in motion by the wind, which drags on the surface of the water as it blows. The water starts flowing in the same direction as the wind.
