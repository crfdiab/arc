What is the highest intensity level on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this reason, the scale is sometimes named Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg scale, or MCS scale. Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann translated it into English, and published it as Mercalli–Wood–Neumann (MWN) scale….Correlation with magnitude.

<table><tr><th>Magnitude</th><th>Typical Maximum Modified Mercalli Intensity</th></tr><tr><td>8.0 or higher</td><td>VIII or higher</td></tr></table>

What is the range of the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale?
-----------------------------------------------------------

It was developed in 1931 by the American seismologists Harry Wood and Frank Neumann. This scale, composed of increasing levels of intensity that range from imperceptible shaking to catastrophic destruction, is designated by Roman numerals.

What intensity is completely devastating?
-----------------------------------------

PHIVOLCS Earthquake Intensity Scale (PEIS)

<table><tr><th>Intensity Scale</th><th>Shaking</th></tr><tr><td>VII</td><td>Destructive</td></tr><tr><td>VIII</td><td>Very Destructive</td></tr><tr><td>IX</td><td>Devastating</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>Completely Devastating</td></tr></table>

Is the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale still used today?
----------------------------------------------------------

The effect of an earthquake on the Earth’s surface is called the intensity. Although numerousintensity scales have been developed over the last several hundred years to evaluate the effects of earthquakes, the one currently used in the United States is the Modified Mercalli (MM) Intensity Scale.

What do you need to know about the Mercalli intensity scale?
------------------------------------------------------------

Jump to navigation Jump to search. The Mercalli intensity scale (or more precisely the Modified Mercalli intensity scale) is a scale to measure the intensity of earthquakes. Unlike with the Richter scale, the Mercalli scale does not take into account energy of an earthquake directly.

Is the USGS based on the Modified Mercalli scale?
-------------------------------------------------

Intensities assigned by the U. S. Geological Survey and (prior to 1973) by agencies in the U. S. Department of Commerce have for many decades been based on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale of 1931 (Wood and Neumann, 1931), which we usually refer to simply as the “Modified Mercalli” or “MM” scale.

What was the magnitude of the Mercalli earthquake?
--------------------------------------------------

The Mercalli Scale Magnitude Typical Mercalli Intensity Felt Near Epi 1.0 – 3.0 I 3.0 – 3.9 II – III 4.0 – 4.9 IV – V 5.0 – 5.9 VI – VII

What was the original name of the Mercalli scale?
-------------------------------------------------

Giuseppe Mercalli (1850-1914) originally developed the scale, with ten levels. In 1902, Adolfo Cancani extended the scale to include twelve levels. August Heinrich Sieberg copletely rewrote the scale. For this reason, the scale is sometimes named Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg scale, or MCS scale.
