How cold is the ground in Antarctica?
-------------------------------------

Just how cold can it get on Earth’s surface? About minus 144°F, according to recent satellite measurements of the coldest known place on the planet. Scientists recorded this extreme temperature on the ice sheet deep in the middle of Antarctica during the long, dark polar winter.

What climate does Antarctica have?
----------------------------------

Antarctica’s Climate Antarctica is the coldest continent on Earth. The average temperature in the interior throughout the year is about -57°C, with the minimum temperature being -90°C during the winter season. It is, on average, the coldest, windiest, and driest of all the continents on Earth.

What is the average temperature in Antarctic?
---------------------------------------------

Antarctica’s average annual temperature ranges from about −10 °C on the coast to −60 °C at the highest parts of the interior. Near the coast, the temperature can exceed +10 °C in summer and fall to below −40 °C in winter. Over the elevated inland, it can rise to about −30 °C in summer but fall below −80 °C in winter.

How does the land and sea make Antarctica cold?
-----------------------------------------------

Land masses Water flows around Antarctica, getting colder and colder. Land traps heat and then transfers heat into ocean currents, which, in turn, bring warmer water up to the Arctic. The Southern hemisphere has relatively little land – just small countries that can not trap as much heat.

Why can t polar bears live in the Antarctic?
--------------------------------------------

The main reasons there are no polar bears in Antarctica are evolution, location and climate.

How cold is Antartica?
----------------------

The temperatures of the Antarctica’s Southern Ocean are influenced by winds and currents that encircle the ocean. Continental Antarctica is the coldest place on earth, with temperatures in some parts being lower than those experienced on Mars. Surface temperatures average at -10 °C but can plunge to -68 °C further inland.

What’s the climate like on the Antarctic Peninsula?
---------------------------------------------------

The Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate. Higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below freezing. The total precipitation on Antarctica, averaged over the entire continent, is about 166 millimetres (6.5 inches) per year (Vaughan et al., J Climate, 1999).

How is the temperature in Antarctica changing over time?
--------------------------------------------------------

Across most of the continent and the surrounding Southern Ocean, temperatures climbed. In some places the rate of warming approached a tenth of a degree Celsius each year, which would translate to more than two degrees over the entire period.

What is the average precipitation in the Antarctic?
---------------------------------------------------

The total precipitation on Antarctica, averaged over the entire continent, is about 166 millimetres (6.5 inches) per year (Vaughan et al., J Climate, 1999).
