Why is the earth axis inclined?
-------------------------------

The angle varies a little over time, but the gravitational pull of the moon prevents it from shifting by more than a degree or so. This tilt is what gives us seasons. The Earth’s axis always points the same direction, so as the planet makes its way around the sun, each hemisphere sees varying amounts of sunlight.

What would happen if Earth was tilted 35 degrees?
-------------------------------------------------

If the earth were to tilt to 35 degree this would mean a massive change in climate. In the northern and southern hemispheres winters would be colder and summers would be hotter, but a significant amount.

How much has the Earth tilted on its axis?
------------------------------------------

Earth’s axis of rotation isn’t straight up and down like the axes of Mercury or Jupiter. Rather, our planet’s axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees.

Why is the earth tilted on its axis?
------------------------------------

The axis of the earth is tilted simply because of the way the earth rotates. The axis does not determine the way the Earth tilts, but the Earth, when spinning, spins at a different angle than the orbit around the sun, which we call flat. Thus, the spin of the Earth is what ultimately determines the tilt or angle of the axis.

How much has the earth tilted on its axis?
------------------------------------------

Today, the Earth’s axis is tilted 23.5 degrees from the plane of its orbit around the sun. But this tilt changes. During a cycle that averages about 40,000 years, the tilt of the axis varies between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees.

What if the Earth was not tilted on its axis?
---------------------------------------------

If the Earth weren’t tilted on its axis, there would be no seasons. And humanity would suffer. When a Mars-size object collided with Earth 4.5 billion years ago, it knocked off a chunk that would become the moon. It also tilted Earth sideways a bit, so that our planet now orbits the sun on a slant.

Is the earth tilted on an axis?
-------------------------------

The Earth is tilted on its rotational axis, running north-south, to a relative figure of 23.5 degrees. This axial tilt is what causes changes to the seasons as the Earth makes its annual journey around the Sun. The tilt allows the two poles to be aligned towards the Sun during June and December, alternatively.
