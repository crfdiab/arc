What are the environmental problems in the ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------------------

Some of the key issues are:

- Pollution.
- Global warming.
- Overpopulation.
- Waste disposal.
- Ocean acidification.
- Loss of biodiversity.
- Deforestation.
- Ozone layer depletion.

How does eco tourism affect the environment?
--------------------------------------------

In addition, it helps preserve biodiversity, accelerates the transition to a green economy, minimizes desertification and pollution, and contributes to the national GDP.

What are the impacts of eco tourism?
------------------------------------

With increased tourism comes increased pressure to develop areas and make them more inclusive and resort-like. Building more accommodation, businesses and amenities within these communities and destinations damages and destroys habitats. By damaging the local environment, you increase the pressure on native species.

What are some of the major environmental problems?
--------------------------------------------------

Some of the major environmental problems are as follows: 1. Ozone Depletion, Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming 2. Desertification 3. Deforestation 4. Loss of Biodiversity 5.

How is overpopulation a problem for the environment?
----------------------------------------------------

Overpopulation: The population of the planet is reaching unsustainable levels as it faces shortage of resources like water, fuel and food. Population explosion in less developed and developing countries is straining the already scarce resources.

How is natural resource depletion a problem for the environment?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Natural Resource Depletion: Natural resource depletion is another crucial current environmental problems. Fossil fuel consumption results in emission of Greenhouse gases, which is responsible for global warming and climate change.

How is urban sprawl a problem for the environment?
--------------------------------------------------

13\. Urban Sprawl: Urban sprawl refers to migration of population from high density urban areas to low density rural areas which results in spreading of city over more and more rural land. Urban sprawl results in land degradation, increased traffic, environmental issues and health issues.
