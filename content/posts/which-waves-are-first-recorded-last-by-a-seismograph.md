Which waves are first recorded last by a seismograph?
-----------------------------------------------------

The P wave is designated the primary preliminary wave because it is the first to arrive at a seismic station after an earthquake. It travels at a speed usually less than 6 kilometers per second in the Earthâ€™s crust and jumps to 13 kilometers per second through the core.

What is the correct order of seismic waves according to speed?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Of the body waves, the primary, or P, wave has the higher speed of propagation and so reaches a seismic recording station faster than the secondary, or S, wave.

How are seismic waves measured in a seismometer?
------------------------------------------------

A seismometer is a device designed to measure movement in the Earth. Seismometers are typically used to measure seismic waves originating from an earthquake or explosion, and traveling through the ground as waves of force in the rocks and soil. The basic design of seismometers is typically based on two objects, or masses.

What do you need to know about a seismograph?
---------------------------------------------

What is a seismograph. A seismograph, or seismometer, is an instrument used to detect and record seismic waves. Seismic waves are propagating vibrations that carry energy from the source of an earthquake outward in all directions.

What is the fundamental sensing principle of a seismometer?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The fundamental sensing principle for the seismometer is based on the differential motion between a free mass (which tends to remain at rest) and a supporting structure anchored in the ground (which moves with the vibrating Earth) to record seismic waves. This same principle is used in accelerometers. The four basic types of seismic waves are:

How are seismic waves related to body waves?
--------------------------------------------

The energy released by the disturbance propagates away from the source of the disturbance as seismic waves. The seismic waves that propagate through the earth are called body waves and are either P waves or S waves. P waves are longitudinal waves while S waves are transverse waves.
