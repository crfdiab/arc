What is the main purpose of nickel?
-----------------------------------

A silvery metal that resists corrosion even at high temperatures. Nickel resists corrosion and is used to plate other metals to protect them. It is, however, mainly used in making alloys such as stainless steel. Nichrome is an alloy of nickel and chromium with small amounts of silicon, manganese and iron.

Is nickel a rare metal?
-----------------------

The most abundant rare earth elements are cerium, yttrium, lanthanum and neodymium \[2\]. They have average crustal abundances that are similar to commonly used industrial metals such as chromium, nickel, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and lead \[1\]. Again, they are rarely found in extractable concentrations.

Where can nickel be mined?
--------------------------

Where Does Nickel Mining Occur? Indonesia is the world’s leading nickel producer, followed by the Philippines. The metal’s stockpiles are believed to be 94 million tonnes worldwide, with Indonesia and Australia owning the world’s greatest nickel reserves.

What are the characteristics of nickel?
---------------------------------------

Nickel is silvery-white. hard, malleable, and ductile metal. It is of the iron group and it takes on a high polish. It is a fairly good conductor of heat and electricity.

Which country has the most nickel deposits?
-------------------------------------------

Indonesia  
As the country with the largest nickel reserves, it is fitting that Indonesia is also the world’s largest producer, having produced 760,000 metric tons in 2020 ….Nickel reserves worldwide as of 2020, by country (in million metric tons)

Where is nickel used in daily life?
-----------------------------------

Nickel is used as an alloying element in cast irons, steels (such as austenitic stainless steels) and non-ferrous alloys. It is also used in nickel-based alloys, which are applied to more challenging applications.

How are precious metals classified in Puerto Rico?
--------------------------------------------------

Precious metals are classified as commercial minerals, according to the Mining Law of Puerto Rico (1979), and as such belong to the Commonwealth.

Where are gold and silver found in Puerto Rico?
-----------------------------------------------

The highest gold and silver values were apparently found in samples with visible chalcopyrite and sphalerite (Bergey, 1960). Precious metals are classified as commercial minerals, according to the Mining Law of Puerto Rico (1979), and as such belong to the Commonwealth.

What kind of products can nickel be used for?
---------------------------------------------

Nickel has outstanding physical and chemical properties, which make it essential in hundreds of thousands of products. Its biggest use is in alloying – particularly with chromium and other metals to produce stainless and heat-resisting steels.

What kind of minerals are found in Puerto Rico?
-----------------------------------------------

Mineralization consists of pyrite and chalcopyrite in a steeply-dipping microcrystalline quartz vein. Oxidized portions of the vein contain malachite and native gold. Silicification is prominent near the vein, and propylitic alteration is widespread.
