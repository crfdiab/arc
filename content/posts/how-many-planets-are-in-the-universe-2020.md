How many planets are in the universe 2020?
------------------------------------------

There are over 700 quintillion planets in the universe — but there’s no place like home.

How many planets are there like Earth in the universe?
------------------------------------------------------

6 billion Earth  
Study estimates there may be up to 6 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy. Earth is the only planet that’s capable of hosting life in the universe. For years, scientists have been hunting for exoplanets – planets beyond our solar system – to discover the probability of life elsewhere in the Milky Way.

What is the 9 planet name?
--------------------------

ever. When many of us grew up, there were nine planets in the Solar System. It was like a fixed point in our brains. As kids, memorizing this list was an early right of passage of nerd pride: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.

How many planets and stars are there in the universe?
-----------------------------------------------------

It stretches for 105,700 light-years in diameter and may contain at least 100 billion planets and around 400 billion stars. Now, if we were to imagine how many planets and stars those 2 trillion galaxies might have, we would probably have to throw out our calculators.

How many solar systems are there in our galaxy?
-----------------------------------------------

That’s just how many we’ve found so far. There are likely to be many more planetary systems out there waiting to be discovered! Our Sun is just one of about 200 billion stars in our galaxy. That gives scientists plenty of places to hunt for exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system.

How many planets are in the Virgo Supercluster?
-----------------------------------------------

The Virgo Supercluster is then one of about 10 million superclusters in the observable universe ( source ). To keep going with our estimates, this would make the number of planets in the universe 10 million times 2 quadrillion (the estimate of the number of planets in the Virgo Supercluster), which comes to 21.6 sextillion. That is 2 plus 23 zeros.

Is there a Planet 9 in our Solar System?
----------------------------------------

Yes, NASA’s astrophysicists have recently presented evidence that a huge and, as yet, undiscovered Planet 9 (or ‘Planet X’) probably exists at the far reaches of our solar system. To read more on this, see our piece on Planet 9. 2. How many stars and planets are in the Milky Way galaxy?
