What kind of decomposers are in the desert?
-------------------------------------------

Many of the desert decomposers you can find are insects.

- Dung beetle: insect that feeds off animal feces.
- Fly: insect that feeds off decaying materials.
- Millipede: arthropod that feeds of decaying plant material.
- Saharan silver ant: fast ants who thrive in deserts and feed off things like animal carcasses. What is a decomposer in a desert food chain?
    --------------------------------------------
    
    Decomposers break down organic matter. These include bacteria and fungi. Most animals are part of more than one food chain and eat more than one kind of food in order to meet their food and energy requirements.
    
    What is the Great Sandy Desert made of?
    ---------------------------------------
    
    It lies in the heart of the Karlamilyi National Park. The Great Sandyâ€™s dunefields comprise both variable and remarkably consistent forms. Its rocky outcrops include sandstone, siltstone and mudstone ridges and ranges in the southeastern part of the desert.
    
    What is found in the Great Australian desert?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    The Great Sandy Desert (GSD) is an interim Australian bioregion, located in the north west of Western Australia straddling the Pilbara and southern Kimberley regions. It is the second largest desert in Australia after the Great Victoria Desert and encompasses an area of 284,993 square kilometres (110,036 sq mi).
    
    What are some decomposers that live in the desert?
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    What Are Some Decomposers That Live in the Desert. One of the only decomposers that is able to survive in the desert is bacteria because they are tiny and can survive in the air. Other decomposers, such as millipedes, earth worms and beetles, also live in the desert, but they have a difficult time surviving because they depend on moist areas.
    
    What kind of rocks are in the Great Sandy Desert?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    The desert is flat for the most part and has tall red sand dune fields that consist of sandstones, siltstones and mudstone ridges. The sand of the desert is extremely dry and does not contain many minerals making it hard for any plants to sustain life. The Uluru also known as the Ayers Rock, is a sandstone rock formation in Central Australia.
    
    What kind of animals live in the Great Sandy Desert?
    ----------------------------------------------------
    
    Invasive animals Invasive animal species known to occur in the Great Sandy Desert bioregion include: Common name Scientific name Feral pig Sus scrofa Fox Vulpes vulpes Rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus Wild dog Canis spp. Feral cat Felis cattus Camel Camelus dromedaries Donkey Equus asinus Horse Equus caballus See www.anra.gov.au for distribution maps
    
    What is the bioregion of the Great Sandy Desert?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    The Great Sandy Desert bioregion is characterised by red sand plains, dunefields and remnant rocky outcrops. Vegetation is predominantly spinifex grasslands, low woodlands and shrubs. Tenure comprises unallocated crown land, conservation reserves and Aboriginal land, with the main industries being tourism, mining and mineral exploration.
