Why has population increased?
-----------------------------

Population began growing rapidly in the Western world during the industrial revolution. The most significant increase in the world’s population has been since the 1950s, mainly due to medical advancements and increases in agricultural productivity.

How do populations grow?
------------------------

In an ideal environment (one that has no limiting factors) populations grow at an exponential rate. As competition increases and resources become increasingly scarce, populations reach the carrying capacity (K) of their environment, causing their growth rate to slow nearly to zero.

How does parasitism affect population growth?
---------------------------------------------

Parasite species varied widely in their effects on host fecundity, host survival, host density reduction, and the frequency with which they drove host populations to extinction (Figure 9.1). The fewer offspring an infected host produced, the lower the density of its population.

What are some of the causes of population increase?
---------------------------------------------------

Causes of population increase include quality health care, increased food production, immigration, fight against poverty and lack of family planning. High population increase has negative impacts to the country, including conflicts, environmental degradation, high cost of living and reduction in natural resources.

Why is the world population expected to decrease?
-------------------------------------------------

This drop is caused by sustained low levels of fertility. The impact of low fertility on population size is reinforced in some locations by high rates of emigration. Between 2019 and 2050, populations are projected to decrease by one per cent or more in 55 countries or areas, of which 26 may see a reduction of at least ten per cent.

What’s the best way to stop population increase?
------------------------------------------------

The relatively easy solution is to stop or reduce drastically population increase. This can be achieved in two ways – increase mortality and/or reduce fertility. Since it is morally wrong to recommend mortality increase, the only alternative is fertility reduction to 2.1 children per couple.

How did the population increase before the Industrial Revolution?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Prior to the industrial revolution the worldwide population growth was quite stable. It was increasing, yes, but not at the extreme rate seen post industrial revolution.
