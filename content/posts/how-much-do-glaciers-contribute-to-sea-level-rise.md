How much do glaciers contribute to sea level rise?
--------------------------------------------------

The melted ice of glaciers therefore accounts for 25 to 30 percent of the currently observed increase in global sea levels.

How does melting glaciers and rising sea levels impact water systems?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Sea levels: rising and rising and rising As glaciers shrink and oceans warm, global sea levels rise. “Local sea-level rise will lead to increased flooding, which could lead to infrastructure and ecosystem damage as well as coastline erosion.”

How high would the sea rise if all ice melted?
----------------------------------------------

about 70 meters  
The simple answer is no. The whole world will never be underwater. But our coastlines would be very different. If all the ice covering Antarctica , Greenland, and in mountain glaciers around the world were to melt, sea level would rise about 70 meters (230 feet).

How did the sea level change during the glacial period?
-------------------------------------------------------

• For millions of years, sea level has fluctuated with changes in the Earth’s climate • During glacial periods, much of the Earth’s water is trapped in glacial ice, with this water released back to the sea during interglacial periods Examination of Ice Cores

How does sea ice affect the circulation of the ocean?
-----------------------------------------------------

Water below sea ice has a higher concentration of salt and is denser than the surrounding ocean water, so it sinks and moves from the surface. In this way, sea ice contributes to the circulation of the global ocean conveyor belt.

How are ice and glaciers part of the water cycle?
-------------------------------------------------

Ice and glaciers are part of the water cycle, even though the water in them moves very slowly. Ice caps influence the weather, too.

How did the Laurentide Ice Sheet affect sea level?
--------------------------------------------------

• The graph on right shows – The rapid fall in sea level as the Laurentide ice sheet built up and – The rapid rise in sea level when the glacier retreated, – Slowing of the rise about 10,000 years ago – Further slowing about 3,000 years ago when near present-day levels were reached (most coastal wetlands formed since this time)
