Where is contour plowing used the most?
---------------------------------------

Contour ploughing is a soil conservation technology that is practiced throughout Grenada to mitigate the negative consequences of natural disasters on soil quality and composition.

Where is contour farming used?
------------------------------

Contour farming is a traditional Pacific Island practice that is very good for growing food on hillsides. When farmers carry out their farming activities (plowing, planting, cultivating, and harvesting) across the slope instead of up and down the slope, they are using contour farming contour farming contour farming.

What is contour plowing used for?
---------------------------------

Contour plowing furrows run crosswise to the slope, slowing runoff and allowing the soil to absorb rainfall rather than wash away. Contour plowing is usually employed along with strip cropping, that is, alternating different crops in narrow strips.

What are the disadvantages of contour plowing?
----------------------------------------------

Drawbacks to contour plowing have caused it to be less widely used than conventional tillage methods. Some farmers may not have been fully aware of erosion damage and prevention. Lack of access to equipment, funding, or training sometimes take their toll.

What is the difference between terracing and contour plowing?
-------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between contour ploughing and terrace farming? In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion. Terrace farming alters the shape of the slope to produce flat areas whereas contour ploughing follows the natural shape of the slope without altering it.

What is an example of contour farming?
--------------------------------------

Contour farming is farming with row patterns that run nearly level around the hill — not up and down the hill. Contour stripcropping is crop rotation and contouring combined in equal-width strips of corn or soybeans planted on the contour and alternated with strips of oats, grasses, or legumes.

What are the types of contour farming?
--------------------------------------

- Mulch farming. Mulch is a layer of crop residue placed on the soil surface.
- Conservation tillage. Soil structure is extremely prone to intense tropical rains and harsh climate.
- Strip cropping.
- Contour farming.
- Cover crops.
- Vegetative hedges or strips. What is the disadvantages of contour System?
    --------------------------------------------
    
    Disadvantages/Cons/Drawbacks: It involves the wastage of land. Lay out requirement in land preparation and irrigation is much bigger in check basin irrigation as compared to other methods. Repairing of ridges and careful supervision during irrigation is needed. Uneven distribution of water within the plot.
    
    Is contour plowing sustainable?
    -------------------------------
    
    Contour farming captures twice the soil moisture and reduces soil erosion up to eight-fold. Above the “T” value means we are losing more soil than we are making which is not sustainable. We can calculate the annual average soil erosion rate by using a formula agronomists call the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation.
    
    Does contour plowing conserve soil?
    -----------------------------------
    
    The Soil Erosion Service was one of the federal programs started in the 1930s to save the land that had been destroyed by years of wind erosion, over plowing, and over grazing. Contour plowing forms ridges, slows the water flow and helps save precious topsoil.
    
    What is the purpose of Contour ploughing in farming?
    ----------------------------------------------------
    
    Contour plowing or contour farming or Contour ploughing is the farming practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of soil erosion.
    
    What happens when you plow parallel to a contour?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    At one end of a contour the slope of the land will always be steeper than at the other. Thus when plowing parallel runs paralleling any contour the plow furrows soon deviate from a true contour. Rain water in these furrows will thus flow sideways along the falling “contour” line.
    
    When to use contour plowing in Western Canada?
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    Contour plowing is also promoted in countries with similar rainfall patterns to the United States such as western Canada and Australia . The practice is effective only on slopes with between 2% and 10% gradient and when rainfall does not exceed a certain amount within a certain period.
    
    Why did Leroy Hoffman change to contour plowing?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    Contour plowing forms ridges, slows the water flow and helps save precious topsoil. LeRoy Hoffman rented farmland for his entire farming career and remembers when the government urged farmers to change their plowing methods.
