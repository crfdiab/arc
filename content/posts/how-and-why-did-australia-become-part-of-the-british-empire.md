How and why did Australia become part of the British Empire?
------------------------------------------------------------

In 1770, Royal Navy James Cook, during his first voyage to the Pacific, sailed along and mapped the east coast of Australia, which he named New South Wales and claimed for Great Britain. The six colonies federated in 1901 and the Commonwealth of Australia was formed as a Dominion of the British Empire.

When did the British Empire invade Australia?
---------------------------------------------

January 26, 1788

Why did people in Australia resent the British Empire?
------------------------------------------------------

One was a campaign against its cruelty (in Britain and Australia). Another was that the growing population of settlers began to see themselves as ‘Australians’ and began to resent Britain dumping its poorest and most troubled people in their country.

Why was South Australia colonised by the British?
-------------------------------------------------

A gold rush to the north and north-west of the town in the 1850s brought large numbers of migrants to the region. A colony at South Australia was formed in 1836, also without convict labor. Here, systematic colonisation was based on the plan of Edward Wakefield. Land was sold to settlers rather than given as grants\]

Why was the British Invasion of Australia a failure?
----------------------------------------------------

Why did the transportation of England end in Australia?
-------------------------------------------------------
