What are the negatives of urban sprawl?
---------------------------------------

As cities get bigger, they clearly have to expand around their peripheries for it is much more difficult to increase central densities. Urban sprawl has many negative consequences for residents and the environment, water and air pollution, increased traffic and traffic jams, increased car dependency, parking, etc.).

What is the main driver for urbanization in China?
--------------------------------------------------

The key determinants of urban expansion in China are population, income, and agricultural land rent, and urban core growth is affected by industrialization (Deng, Huang, Rozelle, &amp; Uchida, 2008).

Housing, water, sanitation, power and jobs are all in short supply in China’s cities. Many of the urban poor are from the countryside. The informal economy is key to a lifestyle described as “informal survivalism.” Developing the informal economy is seen as key to providing jobs and services.

    For years, scientists have argued that sprawling urban and suburban development patterns are creating negative impacts including habitat fragmentation, water and air pollution, increased infrastructure costs, inequality, and social homogeneity (Ewing 1997; Squires 2002).
    
    What are the impacts of urbanisation?
    -------------------------------------
    
    Poor air and water quality, insufficient water availability, waste-disposal problems, and high energy consumption are exacerbated by the increasing population density and demands of urban environments.
    
    Why is there so much sprawl in China?
    -------------------------------------
    
    Industrial land is heavily subsidised, so factories have remained in urban areas rather than move to cheaper sites on city outskirts. The amount of land classified as urban has more than doubled since 2000—40% of new urbanites became so when cities engulfed their villages. Sprawl has resulted in populations becoming more thinly spread.

Some live in the basements of apartment blocks, or in shacks built in courtyards.
