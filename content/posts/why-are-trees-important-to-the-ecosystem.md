Why are trees important to the ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------

TREES SUSTAIN LIFE ON EARTH Trees are a vital part of our planet’s ecosystem. We all rely on trees and their products: oxygen, fruits, wood, water, medicines and soil nutrients to name a few. They not only give life, but they also improve livelihoods.

How do trees affect ecosystems?
-------------------------------

At a larger level, trees help mitigate climate change. They sequester carbon in their trunks by taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Trees reduce the most common greenhouse gas contributing to climate change, and your investment in trees thereby helps preserve the environment.

Why should we save trees?
-------------------------

Why Should we Save Trees? Trees have a major contribution to the sustenance of the environment. They provide oxygen, improve air quality, maintain climate, conserve water, preserve soil, and support wildlife. Trees take in carbon dioxide during the process of photosynthesis and produce the oxygen we breathe.

What is the important of trees?
-------------------------------

Trees are vital. As the biggest plants on the planet, they give us oxygen, store carbon, stabilise the soil and give life to the world’s wildlife. They also provide us with the materials for tools and shelter.

How trees are useful in our life?
---------------------------------

How do trees benefit humans?
----------------------------

Trees help us breathe Trees produce oxygen and clean carbon dioxide out of the air we breathe. Without trees, life could not continue. Trees have also proved to remove airborne particles from the air and reduce smog, thereby improving the air we breathe, and therefore, our respiratory health.

How do we save tree?
--------------------

Here are some simple ways children can help save trees.

1. Don’t waste paper. We are all aware that we can help save trees from being cut down by using less paper.
2. Play with Rubbish!

4. Plant a tree.
5. Visit the forest.
6. Stay on the footpaths/trails.

How are trees a good thing for the environment?
-----------------------------------------------

Trees clean the air. Not only do trees produce oxygen but they also absorb carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases. Trees help prevent natural disasters. The roots of trees capture rainwater that might otherwise cause floods or landslides. Trees provide a home for wildlife. Many species rely on trees for shelter and food.

How are trees a part of the ecosystem?
--------------------------------------

Trees provide an ecosystem for animals, insects, and other life. Trees are an important part of many ecosystems. They are not just part of the carbon cycle, but also a home and a food source for many critters.

How are trees good for the air we breathe?
------------------------------------------

Trees help us breathe. Trees produce oxygen and clean carbon dioxide out of the air we breathe. Without trees, life could not continue. Trees have also proved to remove airborne particles from the air and reduce smog, thereby improving the air we breathe, and therefore, our respiratory health.

What are the benefits of being in the forest?
---------------------------------------------

Being among trees has real health benefits. Studies show that even looking at trees can calm us. The Japanese even have a word for this: Shirin-yoku, or forest bathing. Spending time in the forest is known to reduce stress, anger, and feelings of depression.
