What are optimal conditions inside a greenhouse?
------------------------------------------------

The ideal temperature inside the greenhouse is about 80 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit, so the first and most important lesson is learning how to keep the internal temperature steady.

What type of conditions do greenhouses have to endure?
------------------------------------------------------

Greenhouses Trap Heat and Light. Plants need light, warm temperatures, air, water, and nutrients to survive and grow. Different plants have different requirements for each of these necessities.

How can climate be controlled in a greenhouse?
----------------------------------------------

The control of humidity provides to avoid the extremely high or low air humidity values. Concerning to energy saving avoiding the high humidity is more important. The control of humidity can be achieved by heating and/or by ventilation. CO2 concentration can be controlled by opening the top window in the greenhouse.

What 5 Environmental factors are ideally controlled in a greenhouse?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The five factors of greenhouse environmental control

- Temperature. Temperature is one of the most important factors responsible for the growth of plants.
- Humidity. Humidity is another important factor essential to maintain plant growth.
- Sunlight.
- Soil moisture.
- Carbon dioxide (CO2)

Should I close my greenhouse door at night?
-------------------------------------------

For effective ventilation: Open all doors and vents on sunny days. These can be left open at night if the temperature remains high. Larger greenhouses may, at high cost, be fitted with automated ventilation and shading.

What factors must be controlled in a greenhouse to improve plant growth?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the factors that need to be controlled in a greenhouse?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The atmospheric factors that must be controlled within a greenhouse are air temperature, relative humidity and carbon dioxide (CO2) content. Latitude and the months the greenhouse will be in operation will be the factors that determine whether heating or cooling will be the primary consideration or whether a combination of both will be required.

How are pests and diseases controlled in a greenhouse?
------------------------------------------------------

To control the pests and diseases in the greenhouse, there are generally two ways to take measures. There is careful monitoring of the crop every day while growing, and where there is a sense of pest &amp; disease, by spraying or drenching on the infected &amp; surrounding crop.

How does a climate control system work in a greenhouse?
-------------------------------------------------------

The greenhouse sensor system have elements that monitor and control temperature, humidity, electrical conductivity, pH, carbon dioxide (c02), fogging, shading and read external weather conditions via a weather station.

What do you need to know about a greenhouse?
--------------------------------------------

A greenhouse is a structure that regulates climate conditions. It can be of any size and shape, and has transparent walls and a roof, allowing the internal temperature to remain warmer than the outside temperature. Greenhouses are primarily made from glass, plastic, steel, and timber.
