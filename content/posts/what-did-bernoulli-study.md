What did Bernoulli study?
-------------------------

Bernoulli, Daniel (1700–82) Swiss mathematician and physicist. His work on hydrodynamics demonstrated that pressure in a fluid decreases as the velocity of fluid flow increases. This fact, which explains the lift of an aircraft, became known as Bernoulli’s principle.

Where did Daniel Bernoulli do his work?
---------------------------------------

Undoubtedly the most important work which Daniel Bernoulli did while in St Petersburg was his work on hydrodynamics. Even the term itself is based on the title of the work which he produced called Hydrodynamica and, before he left St Petersburg, Daniel left a draft copy of the book with a printer.

What nationality is Bernoulli?

What was Daniel Bernoulli’s first profession?
---------------------------------------------

In 1734, Bernoulli left St. Petersburg to return to Basel, where he took a position teaching Botany. Although this wasn’t what he was really interested in, he was glad to be back home. Eventually, he would be named a professor of physics at Basel, which suited him much better.

Why is Bernoulli’s principle important?
---------------------------------------

Bernoulli’s Principle is the single principle that helps explain how heavier-than-air objects can fly. Air pressure is the amount of pressure, or “push”, air particles exert. It is this principle that helps us understand how airplanes produce lift (or the ability to get into the air).

What is Bernoulli’s first name?
-------------------------------

Daniel Bernoulli  
Daniel Bernoulli FRS (German: \[bɛʁˈnʊli\]; 8 February \[O.S. 29 January\] 1700 – 27 March 1782) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family from Basel.

Is Bernoulli an Italian name?
-----------------------------

The Bernoulli family (German pronunciation: \[bɛʁˈnʊli\]) of Basel was a patrician family, notable for having produced eight mathematically gifted academics who, among them, contributed substantially to the development of mathematics and physics during the early modern period.
