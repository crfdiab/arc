Why does the Moon rise 50 minutes later each day?
-------------------------------------------------

The Moon is continually moving on ahead in its orbit while the Earth rotates. Because the Moon has moved 13 degrees or so since its last moonrise, it’s going to take another hour or so for the Earth to catch back up to the Moon’s new location, delaying the Moon’s rising above your horizons by ~50 minutes each day.

Why does the Moon rises about 30 to 70 minutes later each day than the previous day?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer: The moon moves in its orbit around the earth in the eastern direction by about 12 to 15 degrees every day. This causes the earth to have to rotate a little extra each day to get to the same proximity of the moon as the previous day. Hence, the moon rises 30 to 70 minutes later each day than the previous day.

How many minutes does the Moon rise later each day?
---------------------------------------------------

50 minutes  
Thus the moon rises, on average, about 50 minutes later each day. The later and later rising times of the moon cause our companion world to appear in a different part of the sky at each nightfall for the two weeks between new and full moon.

Why does moon rises late on Karwa Chauth?
-----------------------------------------

Why Does the Moon Rise Late on Karwa Chauth? The fast, or vrat, is observed on the fourth day, after the full moon of the month, which rises at the same time as the sunset. With every passing day, the Earth orientations to the Moon shifts by 12 degrees and thus the Moon rise is 48 minutes late every day.

How long does it take for the Moon to rise every day?
-----------------------------------------------------

In addition, all the places on earth would have experienced the same delay (of 50 minutes) in moon-rise time everyday. But since the planes are oriented in the way they are, the daily ‘delay’ in the moon-rise time is different at different places on earth and they average out to be about 50 minutes.

What causes the Moon to rise in the sky?
----------------------------------------

Moonrise happens when the Earth has rotated enough on its own axis that the Moon has appeared in your personal sky – your horizon has caught up with the Moon. When exactly that happens is a combination of the Earth’s rapid rotation, and the Moon’s continual motion through the skies.

How does the position of the moon vary from day to day?
-------------------------------------------------------

It depends on how far the Moon dips below the horizon from one day to the next. Our satellite moves, on average, 13.2° per day relative to the background stars. But the angle at which the Moon’s orbit (tilted 5° to Earth’s orbit around the Sun) intercepts the eastern horizon varies considerably during any given month.

How does the angle of the moon affect the Earth?
------------------------------------------------

When the angle is steep, the Moon will lie well below the horizon at the same time the following night and Earth must rotate more to bring it into view. When the angle is shallow, Luna dips only a few degrees below the horizon from one night to the next and rises with much less lag time.
