Are faults older than rock layers?
----------------------------------

A fault is always younger than the rock it cuts through. The surface where new rock layers meet a much older rock surface beneath them is called an unconformity. An unconformity is a gap in the geologic record.

Are faults older than the rocks they displace?
----------------------------------------------

The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that a fault or intrusion is younger than the rocks that it cuts through. The fault cuts through all three sedimentary rock layers (A, B, and C) and also the intrusion (D). So the fault must be the youngest feature.

When looking at layers or rock which layers are newer which are older?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

According to the Law of Superposition newer rock layers form on top of already existing layers. As more and more layers are deposited, the older rock layers end up at the bottom and the newer ones toward the top. 3.

Which rock or feature is the oldest?
------------------------------------

The oldest zircon dates are 4.36 billion years. Before this study, the oldest dated rocks were from a body of rock known as the Acasta Gneiss in the Northwest Territories, which are 4.03 billion years old.

Which is older fault or intrusion?
----------------------------------

The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that a fault or intrusion is younger than the rocks that it cuts. The fault labeled ‘E’ cuts through all three sedimentary rock layers (A, B, and C) and also cuts through the intrusion (D). So the fault must be the youngest formation that is seen.

What is the oldest fault?
-------------------------

In our area, the longest and most active of these many cracks was the Ramapo Fault, which, through a process known as normal faulting, caused one side of the earth’s crust to slip lower—the Piedmont—relative to the other side—the Highlands. “All this occurred about 225 million years ago,” says Gates.

At which location is the oldest rock most likely to be found?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Bedrock along the northeast coast of Hudson Bay, Canada, has the oldest rock on Earth. Canadian bedrock more than 4 billion years old may be the oldest known section of the Earth’s early crust.

Which rock layer would be determined to be the oldest?
------------------------------------------------------

bottom layer  
The bottom layer of rock forms first, which means it is oldest. Each layer above that is younger, and the top layer is youngest of all. This ordering is relative because you cannot be sure exactly when each layer formed, only that each layer is younger then the one below it.

Which is younger a fault or a rock layer?
-----------------------------------------

always younger than the rock layers around and beneath it. More clues come from the study of faults. A fault is a break in Earth’s crust. A fault is always younger than the rock it cuts through. The surface where new rock layers meet a much older rock surface beneath them is called an unconformity. An

Is the intrusion older or younger than rock layer B?
----------------------------------------------------

An intrusion is always younger than the rock layers around and beneath it. More clues come from the study of faults. A fault is a break in Earth’s crust. A fault is always younger than the rock it cuts through.

Which is older rock layer F or D?
---------------------------------

First, we know from the principle of superposition that rock layer F is older than E, E is older than D, D is older than C, and C is older than B. Second, we observe that rock layer H (which is an igneous intrusion) cuts into rock layers B-F.

How do Geologists know the age of a rock?
-----------------------------------------

When investigating rocks in the field, geologists commonly observe features such as igneous intrusions or faults that cut through other rocks. Because these features are the ones doing the cutting, we know that they are younger than the rocks that they cut into.
