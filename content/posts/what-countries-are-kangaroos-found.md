What countries are kangaroos found?
-----------------------------------

Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea.

Do kangaroos exist in Africa?
-----------------------------

Kangaroos aren’t native to Africa. Kangaroos and wallabies are a type of marsupial called a macropod. Macropods only exist in Australia, New Guinea, and a few nearby islands. Marsupials originated in North America.

Could kangaroos survive in America?
-----------------------------------

All species of kangaroos are herbivores, and even in their native Australia, they are found living in habitats ranging from forests to grasslands. It’s not impossible that a kangaroo population could live off the land in the U.S., but as the largest marsupial on the planet, it would be hard for them hide.

Are kangaroos friendly to humans?
---------------------------------

But many people see large male kangaroos as placid grazing animals. The reality is that they can be aggressive towards people. Although the risk of this happening is very small, we still need to be wary around them.

Can female kangaroos swim?
--------------------------

All kangaroos have short hair, powerful hind legs, small forelimbs, big feet and a long tail. They have excellent hearing and keen eyesight. They also use their tail when swimming; that’s right – kangaroos are good swimmers! They swim to avoid predators, and can use their forepaws to drown pursuers.

Can kangaroos stand on their tail?
----------------------------------

Kangaroos can stand erect on their hind legs, supported by their tail as the third leg of a tripod (they can even balance on their tail alone). Kangaroos use “pentapedal locomotion” while grazing. In this gait, the tail and the forelimbs form a tripod while the hind legs are being moved.

Are there any kangaroos that live outside of Australia?
-------------------------------------------------------

Kangaroos predominantly exist in Australia. Those that are found outside Australia were introduced to those parts by humans. Kangaroos live in a few other countries apart from Australia. These countries include Papua New Guinea which is a state located north of Australia and New Zealand.

Why do kangaroos live in Papua New Guinea?
------------------------------------------

Kangaroos are found mainly in Australia, but also in Papua New Guinea (to the north). It seem no one really know why kangaroos are in Australia. They are a grass eating marsupial – fun to watch. One theory is that they only survived in Australia because there are no fierce meat eating predators!

Where did the First Kangaroos come from in the world?
-----------------------------------------------------

At the time all continents were part of the super continent known as Gondwanaland. However, 180 million years ago, the continents split away occupying their present locations. Consequently, most of the kangaroos became natives of Australia. Therefore, the original home of the kangaroos was South America.

Where do rat kangaroos and antilopine kangaroos live?
-----------------------------------------------------

The rat-kangaroos like to make their abode in little nests in the rainforests in northeastern Queensland. However, the gray kangaroos live in the forests of Tasmania and Australia. Antilopine kangaroos, on the other hand, have their habitat in the eucalyptus woodlands located far north of Australia.
