How do I know if my power supply is AC or DC?
---------------------------------------------

One way to determine if you have an AC-DC power supply or a DC-DC model is to look at the device itself. Often, the input and output information will appear somewhere on the surface. If the input is AC, you have an AC-DC power supply, and you have a DC-DC model if the input and output both are DC.

Is house hold current AC or DC?
-------------------------------

Many devices in your house need DC. When you plug things into the outlet in your house, you don’t get DC. Household outlets are AC – Alternating Current. This current has a frequency of 60 Hz and would look something like this (if you plotted current as a function of time).

What is the main source of electricity in South Africa?
-------------------------------------------------------

coal  
The main energy resources in the South African economy are coal, oil, gas, nuclear power, hydropower and renewable sources such as wind, solar, biomass and wave power. Figure 2, gives the percentage distribution of energy to total primary energy supply in South Africa during 20007.

What type of electricity is supplied in residential areas AC or DC?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the Americas use 60 Hz AC, the 120/240 volt split-phase system domestically and three phase for larger installations. North American transformers usually power homes at 240 volts, similar to Europe’s 230 volts. It is the split-phase that allows use of 120 volts in the home.

Why AC is dangerous than DC?
----------------------------

AC current is said to be more dangerous than DC current because the root mean squared value of AC is much more than its original value. Our heart is driven by electric pulses; the high electric frequency of AC current can affect the frequency of the heart and can lead to a heart attack.

How do you convert AC to DC?
----------------------------

In the first step of converting AC to DC, the voltage is rectified using a series of diodes. This transforms the sinusoidal AC wave into a series of positive peaks using a rectifier. At this point, however, there is still waveform fluctuation – the time between the peaks – that needs to be removed.

Who is the electricity supplier in South Africa?
------------------------------------------------

The supplier of South African electricity, Eskom, and government, have prioritized the extension of the South African electrical grid with the construction of new power stations, diversification of power sources and instituting energy efficient programs. Tourists to South Africa should be aware that:

What are the power plugs in South Africa?
-----------------------------------------

There were four plug and socket versions: 2 A, 5 A (=type D), 15 A (=type M) and 30 A. South Africa initially standardized on both the 5 amp plug ( type D) and the 15 amp plug ( type M ), but in the end only type M sockets remained. In older buildings, however, type D sockets can still be found.

What is the mains voltage in South Africa?
------------------------------------------

What is the mains voltage in South Africa ? In South Africa, the standard voltage is 230 volts and the frequency is 50 Hz. 230 V ~ 50 Hz

What kind of energy is used in South Africa?
--------------------------------------------

With current-generation methods being primarily coal-based, and as such being extremely high emitters of carbon dioxide, the government is seeking a more diversified environmentally friendly energy mix. On a national scale, it is actively supporting a number of sustainable clean-energy generation initiatives.
