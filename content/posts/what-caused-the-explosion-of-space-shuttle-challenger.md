What caused the explosion of space shuttle Challenger?
------------------------------------------------------

Hot gases from the rocket had slipped past the O-rings in two of the SRB segments. At roughly the 73-second mark after launch, the right SRB triggered the rupture of the external fuel tank. Liquid hydrogen and oxygen ignited, and the explosion enveloped Challenger.

Why did the Challenger explode 35 years ago?
--------------------------------------------

After an investigation, the cause of the explosion was determined to be an o-ring failure in a solid rocket booster. Cold weather was a contributing factor.

Who was on the Space Shuttle Challenger when it exploded?
---------------------------------------------------------

The NASA space shuttle Challenger exploded on January 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after liftoff, bringing a devastating end to the spacecraft’s 10th mission. The disaster claimed the lives of all seven astronauts aboard, including Christa McAuliffe, a teacher from New Hampshire who would have been the first civilian in space.

What was the result of the Challenger disaster?
-----------------------------------------------

The Challenger disaster grounded NASA’s space shuttle program for about three years, but some key changes were made once it restarted. Technical changes were made to the shuttle, and NASA worked to change its workforce culture to become more transparent. The shuttle program resumed on September 29, 1988 with Space Shuttle Discovery.

What was the weather like when the Challenger went into space?
--------------------------------------------------------------

(Image credit: NASA) It was a cold morning on Jan. 28, 1986, when Challenger was supposed to fly into space. Temperatures dipped below freezing and some of the shuttle’s engineers were concerned about the integrity of the seals on the solid rocket boosters in such low temperatures.

Aftermath of the Challenger Explosion The NASA space shuttle Challenger exploded on January 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after liftoff, bringing a devastating end to the spacecraft’s 10th mission.
