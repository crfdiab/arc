Which is an example of man made pollution?
------------------------------------------

Many sources of air pollution are man-made. Industrial processes often create both types of pollutants that escape into the air. Automobiles and other moving sources of pollution affect the quality of air. Agriculture adds to air pollution through the methane and ammonia produced by animal waste.

What are the different types of air pollution?
----------------------------------------------

Air pollution includes particulate materials and toxic pollutants that come from many different sources. Particulate materials include large particles, such as dust, lead or asbestos, and small particles, including nitrates and sulfates.

What are the individual reactions to air pollution?
---------------------------------------------------

Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individualâ€™s health status and genetics.

What kind of air pollution makes it difficult to see?
-----------------------------------------------------

Smog is a type of air pollution that looks like smoky fog and makes it difficult to see. Smog is a type of air pollution in cities that makes it difficult to see outside. Here are images of Beijing on a clear day after a rain (left) and on a smoggy day (right).

What are some ways to control air pollution?
--------------------------------------------

Other air pollution control measures include: By minimizing and reducing the use of fire and fire products. Since industrial emissions are one of the major causes of air pollution, the pollutants can be controlled or treated at the source itself to reduce its effects. Fuel substitution is another way of controlling air pollution.

Which is an example of a secondary pollutant?
---------------------------------------------

The pollutants formed by the intermingling and reaction of primary pollutants are known as secondary pollutants. Smog, formed by the intermingling of smoke and fog, is a secondary pollutant. Also Read: Water Pollution Causes of Air Pollution
