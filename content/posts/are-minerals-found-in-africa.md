Are minerals found in Africa?
-----------------------------

Africa is richly endowed with mineral reserves and ranks first in quantity of world reserves of bauxite, cobalt, industrial diamond, phosphate rock, platinum-group metals (PGM), vermiculite, and zirconium. Many other minerals are present in quantity.

Where is mining in Africa?
--------------------------

Some of the major mining countries in Africa are Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. It is estimated that Africa houses roughly 30 percent of the known global mineral reserves, and these desirable commodities have been extracted, and often exploited, for centuries.

How are minerals obtained?
--------------------------

Once a mineral deposit has been found it has to be extracted from the ground to access the valuable minerals it contains. This can be done by opencast quarrying or underground mining. Certain minerals can also be extracted by pumping.

Why are there so many minerals in Africa?
-----------------------------------------

South Africa is endowed with precious minerals because they have ultramafic rocks. The rocks were formed during the early stages of fractional crystallisation. They were formed at a very high temperature and pressure. Secondly, South Africa’s geology hosts some of the oldest surviving Archean rocks.

Which country in Africa is richest in minerals?
-----------------------------------------------

Democratic Republic of Congo – rich in copper, cobalt, diamond, oil, coltan, gold, and tin. DRC has one of the richest deposits of mineral resources. Since 1960, DRC has been known for its mineralization as one of the most industrialized countries in Africa.

What are minerals and its types?
--------------------------------

Minerals are classified into two types: Metallic and non-metallic. Ferrous minerals: They contain iron. Examples are iron ore, manganese ore, chromite, pyrite, nickel, and cobalt. Non-ferrous minerals: They contain metals other than iron. Examples include gold, silver, copper, lead, bauxite, tin and magnesium.

Where do most of Africa’s minerals come from?
---------------------------------------------

North Africa’s reserves of petroleum and iron ore may run out in a few decades. In sub-Saharan Africa, metals and minerals are concentrated in a few major areas, and about half of the region’s mineral production comes from two countries: SOUTH AFRICA with its gold and diamonds and NIGERIA with petroleum.

What are the natural resources of East Africa?
----------------------------------------------

East Africa. In East Africa, there are many different natural resources to be found. This includes Coal, Natural Gas, Petroleum, precious metals, minerals, and Uranium. East Africa is also notorious for having one of the biggest oil deposits in the world. Countries in this part of Africa are experiencing the highest investment levels on Earth.

Which is the largest mining country in Africa?
----------------------------------------------

Minerals and mineral fuels accounted for more than 50% of the export earnings of Mali (gold), Mauritania (iron ore), Mozambique (aluminium), Namibia (diamond, uranium, gold, and zinc), and Zambia (copper and cobalt).

What was the mineral industry in South Africa?
----------------------------------------------

An additional $9.56 billion was reported for potential precious metals projects in South Africa (that is, feasibility-level projects for which funds had not yet been committed). PGM accounted for 69% of the investment and gold 31%. Potential investments in iron ore projects was at least $950 million.
