What is it called when an ecosystem has reached balance?
--------------------------------------------------------

The balance of nature (also known as ecological balance) is a theory that proposes that ecological systems are usually in a stable equilibrium or homeostasis, which is to say that a small change (the size of a particular population, for example) will be corrected by some negative feedback that will bring the parameter …

When an ecosystem is balanced it has reached?
---------------------------------------------

Ecological balance has been defined by various online dictionaries as “a state of dynamic equilibrium within a community of organisms in which genetic, species and ecosystem diversity remain relatively stable, subject to gradual changes through natural succession.” and “A stable balance in the numbers of each species …

When does an ecosystem go into an ecological imbalance?
-------------------------------------------------------

If something happens in an ecosystem, it can shift from a state of balance to a state of imbalance. Ecological imbalance is when a natural or human-caused disturbance disrupts the natural balance of an ecosystem. A disturbance is any change that causes a disruption in the balance of an ecosystem.

How does deforestation affect an unbalanced ecosystem?
------------------------------------------------------

Deforestation impacts changes in temperature causing the forest floor to become dryer. The plant matter that was once there before deforestation helped keep the ecosystem together but due to deforestation, the lack of trees increases wind and flood rains to impact the forest floor which raises the chance of erosion.

How are humans a part of a balanced ecosystem?
----------------------------------------------

Although, humans depend on a balanced ecosystem in terms of productive soil and healthy meat and fish. The pollution input from humans’ activities (industries and agriculture) disrupts this balance of the ecosystem and subsequently, an imbalance of nutrients occurs.

How does pollution affect the balance of the ecosystem?
-------------------------------------------------------

Pollution originates from domestic and industrial effluents and runoff from agriculture intimidates the balance of marine ecosystems. Controlling non-point source pollutions especially from agriculture farms remarkably helps to sustain the ecological balance.
