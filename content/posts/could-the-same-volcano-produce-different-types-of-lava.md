Could the same volcano produce different types of lava?
-------------------------------------------------------

The fact that different mineralogies and textures may be developed from the same initial magmas has led petrologists to rely heavily on chemistry to look at a volcanic rock’s origin.

What is the difference between volcano and lava?
------------------------------------------------

is that volcano is a vent or fissure on the surface of a planet (usually in a mountainous form) with a magma chamber attached to the mantle of a planet or moon, periodically erupting forth lava and volcanic gases onto the surface while lava is the melted rock ejected by a volcano from its crater or fissured sides.

How are the different types of volcanoes different?
---------------------------------------------------

Types of Lava. There are several different types of volcanoes: steep stratovolcanoes, wide shield volcanoes, and mounded lava domes. The shape of a volcano actually depends on the types of lava that it’s made up of. And so, there are several different types of lava. The type of lava coming out of a volcano depends on its mineral content.

How are the different types of lava different?
----------------------------------------------

And so, there are several different types of lava. The type of lava coming out of a volcano depends on its mineral content. Some lava is very thin, and can flow out of a volcano in great rivers that go for dozens of kilometers. Other lava is very thick, and only flows for a short distance before cooling and hardening.

What happens to the lava when a volcano erupts?
-----------------------------------------------

These volcanoes produce large violent eruptions which often lead to mud-slides and produce fast moving clouds of hot gas and volcanic matter called pyroclastic flow.

What kind of lava does a shield volcano produce?
------------------------------------------------

Shield volcano These volcanoes have a flat dome-like appearance and release lava in a gentle manner that is generally slow and easy for humans and animals to out run. They produce Basaltic lava, which is the most common type found on earth.
