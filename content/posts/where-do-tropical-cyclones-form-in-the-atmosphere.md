Where do tropical cyclones form in the atmosphere?
--------------------------------------------------

Tropical cyclones form over warm waters of the tropical or subtropical zone from pre-existing disturbances, which consist of areas of instability, such as tropical waves. They may also form in the area of instability at the southern end of a cold front and sometimes from areas of low cold core pressure (cold lows) in the upper atmosphere.

How is tropical cyclogenesis different from mid latitude cyclones?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Tropical cyclogenesis is the development and strengthening of a tropical cyclone. The mechanisms by which tropical cyclogenesis occurs are distinctly different from those that produce mid- latitude cyclones.

What is the process of cyclone formation and intensification?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Cyclogenesis is the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies.

How many types of cyclones are there in the world?
--------------------------------------------------

A cyclone of a large enough magnitude could cause several tornadoes. Cyclones are categorized into five types depending on their intensity and the damage that are capable of causing. Cyclones are categorized into five divisions based on their wind speeds. Category 1 includes cyclones having wind speeds of up to 125 kilometres per hour.

How often do tropical cyclones occur in Australia?
--------------------------------------------------

Approximately on average 10 tropical cyclones develop over the Australian waters are approximately six of the ten cyclones hit the coastline. El Niño and la Nina are Spanish words which refer to the amount of rain fall in an area. For cyclones, if they form in the el Nino region, where it is warm and moist, it is a tropical cyclone.

How are tropical cyclones and hurricanes the same?
--------------------------------------------------

The scientific term for all these storms is tropical cyclone. Only tropical cyclones that form over the Atlantic Ocean or eastern Pacific Ocean are called “hurricanes.”. Whatever they are called, tropical cyclones all form the same way. Tropical cyclones are like giant engines that use warm, moist air as fuel.

What are tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean called?
------------------------------------------------------

In the western South Pacific and Indian Ocean they are variously referred to as severe tropical cyclones, tropical cyclones, or simply cyclones. All these different names refer to the same type of storm.
