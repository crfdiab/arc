Who provides the most energy in the ecosystem?
----------------------------------------------

Explanation: Producers (plants) have the most energy in a food chain or web (besides the sun) and they give an organism more energy than a primary consumer or secondary consumer would.

What provides the most energy in a food chain?
----------------------------------------------

The Sun  
3.1 The Sun is the major source of energy for organisms and the ecosystems of which they are a part. Producers such as plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use the energy from sunlight to make organic matter from carbon dioxide and water. This establishes the beginning of energy flow through almost all food webs.

Which trophic level has the most energy and number of organisms?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The first trophic level contains the greatest number of organisms and is comprised mainly of plants. The organisms in this layer are called primary producers because they get their energy from an abiotic source. Most primary producers get their energy directly from the sun.

What consumers get the most energy?
-----------------------------------

Food Chains and Energy Flow

<table><tr><th>A</th><th>B</th></tr><tr><td>Which group of consumers receives the most energy in a food chain?</td><td>plant eaters (herbivores)</td></tr><tr><td>Which group of consumers receives the least amount of energy in a food chain?</td><td>tertiary or top level consumers</td></tr></table>

Who is the end of food chain?
-----------------------------

Thus the living part of a food chain always starts with plant life and ends with an animal. Plants are called producers because they are able to use light energy from the sun to produce food (sugar) from carbon dioxide and water. Animals cannot make their own food so they must eat plants and/or other animals.

Why are trophic levels important in the food chain?
---------------------------------------------------

While some organisms (autotrophs) can produce energy, others (heterotrophs) must consume other organisms to meet their energy needs. Trophic levels enable us to see the general energy relationship between different organisms as well as how that energy flows through the food chain.

Which is trophic level has the maximum energy in the ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------------------------

No soil, no food, no life. The trophic level of an organism is the position it occupies in the food chain. Plant and algae use sunlight to make their food, are called PRODUCERS. The top level of the food chain are the APEX PREDATORS. Lions, for example, are land apex predators, the kings of the jungle.

Which is the primary source of energy in the food chain?
--------------------------------------------------------

The trophic level helps determine the nutritional relationship between the organism and the primary source of energy. The primary source of energy in any food chain is the sun, except in the case of some deep-sea ecosystems.

Which is the level with the most energy?
----------------------------------------

Answer and Explanation: The first trophic level of the food chain has the most energy. This level contains the producers, which are all of the photosynthetic organisms. Which level has the least amount of energy? Tertiary consumers receive 10% of the energy available at the secondary level (0.1% of the original energy).
