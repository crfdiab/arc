Why can we predict tides?
-------------------------

The tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon, which create “bulges” of water in the oceans. So the most important factors in predicting the tides are the positions of the Sun and Moon — their distance from Earth, their direction in space, and how they’re moving.

Why do we have two high tides per day?
--------------------------------------

Because the Earth rotates through two tidal “bulges” every lunar day, coastal areas experience two high and two low tides every 24 hours and 50 minutes. Since the Earth rotates through two tidal “bulges” every lunar day, we experience two high and two low tides every 24 hours and 50 minutes.

What causes the tides to be the way they are?
---------------------------------------------

What Causes the Tides? Tides may seem simple on the surface, but the ins and outs of tides confounded great scientific thinkers for centuries they even led Galileo astray into a bunk theory. Today people know that the gravitational pulls between the earth, moon and sun dictate the tides. The moon, however, influences tides the most.

How is the force of the Moon related to the tides?
--------------------------------------------------

Arrows represent the force of the moon’s gravitational pull on Earth. To get the tidal force—the force that causes the tides—we subtract this average gravitational pull on Earth from the gravitational pull at each location on Earth.

What causes high tides and low tides in Canada?
-----------------------------------------------

The tidal force causes Earth—and its water—to bulge out on the side closest to the moon and the side farthest from the moon. These bulges of water are high tides.

How does inertia affect high tide on Earth?
-------------------------------------------

If no other forces were at play, shores would experience one high tide a day as the earth rotated on its axis and coasts ran into the oceans’ bulge facing the moon. However, inertia — the tendency of a moving object to keep moving — affects the earth’s oceans too.
