What two fronts make a tornado?
-------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseIn simple terms, tornados are formed during severe weather cycles that combine thunderstorms, colliding air masses (or fronts), a combination of cold and warm air, and high and low pressure changes. When two or more moving air masses (cold or warm fronts) collide, strong weather will develop.

What two air masses are responsible for Tornado Alley?
------------------------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseYou need warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air from Canada. When these two air masses meet, they create instability in the atmosphere.

What type of front is associated with most tornadoes?
-----------------------------------------------------

Cold fronts  
Hear this out loudPauseCold fronts are notoriously known for their bad weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes and heavy rain. Many of our severe weather events during the winter months are caused by cold fronts. These fronts can produce tornadoes over Florida during the winter.

Which two regions together are known as Tornado Alley?
------------------------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseAlthough the boundaries of Tornado Alley are debatable (depending on which criteria you use—frequency, intensity, or events per unit area), the region from central Texas, northward to northern Iowa, and from central Kansas and Nebraska east to western Ohio is often collectively known as Tornado Alley.

How do cold fronts work?
------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseA cold front forms when a cold air mass pushes into a warmer air mass. They move fast, up to twice as fast as a warm front. As a cold front moves into an area, the heavier (more dense) cool air pushes under the lighter (less dense) warm air, causing it to rise up into the troposphere.

Where is Tornado Alley in the United States?
--------------------------------------------

There’s no official boundary but the nation’s tornado alley usually includes Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota. These states have the highest frequency of strong tornadoes. Arkansas may not be included in this alley but we are apart of “Dixie Alley,” an area of the Mid-South with relatively high tornado frequency and damage.

What causes tornadoes to form in Tornado Alley?
-----------------------------------------------

Tornadoes are produced when two differing air masses meet. When cooler polar air masses meet warm and moist tropical air masses, the potential for severe weather is created. In tornado alley, air masses to the west are typically continental airmasses meaning there is little moisture in the air.

When does Tornado Alley start in the Gulf Coast?
------------------------------------------------

The Gulf Coast area has a separate tornado maximum nicknamed “Dixie Alley” with a relatively high frequency of tornadoes occurring in the late fall (October through December).

How are tornadoes formed in the Central Plains?
-----------------------------------------------

 When cooler polar air masses meet warm and moist tropical air masses, the potential for severe weather is created. In tornado alley, air masses to the west are typically continental air masses meaning there is little moisture in the air. This warm, dry air meets the warm, moist air in the Central Plains creating a dryline.
