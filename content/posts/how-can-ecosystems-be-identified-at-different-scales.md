How can ecosystems be identified at different scales?
-----------------------------------------------------

Ecosystems can be classified into three main scales. Micro: A small scale ecosystem such as a pond, puddle, tree trunk, under a rock etc. Messo: A medium scale ecosystem such as a forest or a large lake.

What are the three main scales of ecosystems?
---------------------------------------------

To make things simple, let us classify ecosystems into three main scales.

- Micro: It is a small scale ecosystem such as a pond, puddle, tree trunk, under a rock, etc.
- Messo: It is a medium scale ecosystem such as a forest or a large lake.
- Biome: What can you do with an ecosystem map?
    --------------------------------------
    
    If an Ecosystem Map helps you identify a previously overlooked user group to interview and job shadow, you can plan to spend time with drivers and the billing department playing Rose, Bud, Thorn or Plan Your Day to gather their input. A good Ecosystem Map should give you the basics for creating Context Scenarios and User Personas.
    
    What do you need to know about learning ecosystems?
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    You only need to know that the technology will work for you to have a successful online experience. For your technical team, learning ecosystems are about the back end. They are the people who need to care about whatâ€™s proprietary APIs, PENS, opinionated systems, custom APIs and so on.
    
    How can humans contribute to the ecosystem services?
    ----------------------------------------------------
    
    Ecosystem services are defined as services provided by nature to humans. This straightforward definition suggests a passive role for humans as receivers of the outputs of nature. However, there is also an active role for people to play in providing these services.
    
    How are the living things in an ecosystem?
    ------------------------------------------
    
    For example, a pond ecosystem may consist of a pond habitat, inhabited by aquatic plants, microorganisms in the mud at the bottom, fish in the water and a heron on the bank. If one part of an ecosystem is changed, this may affect other living things in the ecosystem.
