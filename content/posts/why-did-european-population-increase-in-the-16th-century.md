Why did European population increase in the 16th century?
---------------------------------------------------------

One reason was food. New crops that had come from the Americas to Asia and Europe during the 16th century contributed to population growth on these continents. The indigenous populations of the Americas, however, were decimated by diseases brought by European colonizers.

What factors led to the growth of Europe’s population during the 1700’s?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The changes in Europe were enhanced by the agricultural revolution.

5. A large population increase happened during this time.
6. Population was increased by new technology allowing for better crops and farming.
7. Increase in health care and living standards increased life spans and birth rates. What led to the emergence of feudalism in Europe?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    As the Vikings invaded western European kingdoms, local nobles took over the duty of raising armies and protecting their property. Power passed from kings to local lords, giving rise to a system known as feudalism.
    
    What were the factors that led to an increase in the population of Europe?
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Most of the European Union’s population growth (900,000, or 62%) was due to net migration; the remainder (500,000, or 38%) came from natural increase, which is the number of births minus the number of deaths.
    
    What was the population of England in the 16th century?
    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    By 1530 the population of England and Wales had risen to around 3 million and by 1600 it was about 4 million.
    
    What was the population growth rate in early modern Europe?
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    
    As noted above, early modern Europe experienced not one constant rate of population growth but an oscillation, that is, fairly rapid growth of about 1 percent per annum between 1500 and 1625 and again after 1750 interrupted by more than a century of rough stability. Yet it is not likely that the outer limits of growth were ever approached.
    
    Why was the population of Europe in 1750 underestimated?
    --------------------------------------------------------
    
    It should also be noted that the 1750 to 1900 figures underestimate growth because they take no cognizance of mass emigration from Europe. Perhaps 50 million Europeans went overseas from 1840 to 1914. Migrants, their children, and their children’s children were removed from the demographic equation.
    
    What was the population of Europe in the 1300s?
    -----------------------------------------------
    
    By 1300, the population of Europe had reached somewhere in the range of 50 to 100 million. Europe’s population would not exceed the limits reached in 1300 until about 1600. Many regions of Europe would not be this populated again until 1700, and in some regions, not until 1800. More people were alive in the 1300s in Europe than ever before.
    
    What was the population like in the Middle Ages?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    In the Early Middle Ages, population totals in Europe were relatively stagnant, growing very slightly from the 6th through 10th centuries. The population of Europe was sparse and during the final few centuries of the Roman Empire’s existence, the population of Europe had fallen, century after century.
