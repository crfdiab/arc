When the lighted side of the Moon faces away from Earth it is called?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

New Moon  
New Moon: The lighted side of the Moon faces away from the Earth. This means that the Sun, Earth, and Moon are almost in a straight line, with the Moon in between the Sun and the Earth. The Moon that we see looks very dark.

What is the light part of the Moon called?
------------------------------------------

highlands  
The light areas are the highlands, which are mountains that were uplifted as a result of impacts. The lunar surface is covered by a fine-grained soil called “regolith” which results from the constant bombardment of the lunar rocks by small meteorites.

Which is the side of the Moon that is facing the Earth?
-------------------------------------------------------

In the diagram above, you can see the Moon always has a lit side (facing the Sun) and a dark side (facing away from the Sun). From the Earth, we can only see the part of the Moon that is facing toward us at any time (which is often called the near side of the Moon) and we cannot see the part of the Moon facing away from Earth…

Why does the Moon always face the Earth?
----------------------------------------

It is often assumed that the moon is a perfect sphere, which it is not. The side of the moon facing earth is more dense than the side facing away. Therefore, it takes energy for the moon to rotate its earth-facing side away from the earth. Such energy is not currently available, so the same side always faces earth, caught in earth’s gravity.

What do you call the shape of the Moon when it is full?
-------------------------------------------------------

The visible shape of the moon is called gibbous (when the moon is between first quarter and full moon phases) Full Moon. The entire sunlit side faces the earth. The time when the moon is fully illuminated. Waning Gibbous. The portion of the moon you can see wanes, or shrinks.

What does it mean when the Moon is in a straight line?
------------------------------------------------------

Full Moon: The lighted side of the Moon faces the Earth. This means that the Earth, Sun, and Moon are nearly in a straight line, with the Earth in the middle. The Moon that we see is very bright from the sunlight reflecting off it. Last Quarter: Sometimes called Third Quarter.
