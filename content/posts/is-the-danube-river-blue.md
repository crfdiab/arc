Is the Danube River Blue?
-------------------------

Exploring the Danube River in Vienna What surprises many people, especially given its prominence in Viennese tradition, is that the Danube doesn’t actually flow through the centre of Vienna, and – like most commercial waterways – it is certainly not blue.

What color is the Danube?
-------------------------

Blue  
Blue, muddy yellow or blood-red: the colour of the Danube varies according to history and geography. Never able to truly form the countries through which it runs into a single political entity, it nevertheless connects peoples and regions reconcilable only in dreams or poetry, writes László Földenyi.

Why was the Blue Danube written?
--------------------------------

The piece was originally written as a choral work. Strauss was commissioned to write a piece for the Vienna Men’s Choral Society to uplift the people of Vienna who were reeling after losing the Austro-Prussian War. He was inspired by Karl Isidor Beck’s poem about the ‘beautiful blue Danube.

Who made Blue Danube?
---------------------

Johann Strauss II  
The Blue Danube/Composers

What is Blue Danube China?

What color is Blue Danube?
--------------------------

If it is a blue you want, try Sailor’s Sea Blue. Unless you have an important wall, I would reconsider painting an accent color. Instead, use a flattering coordinate which works both with the east exposure and the blue walls. I would suggest a pale yellow, in fabric and/or art.

Why was the Danube called the Blue Danube?
------------------------------------------

One can sense the longing for the carefree suppression of memory, but also sadness about the inexorability of fate. These lines also arose on the banks of the Danube – the Danube that, in his waltz composed a few years earlier in 1866, the same Johann Strauss called blue ( The Blue Danube ).

Why did Strauss bring the Blue Danube to Paris?
-----------------------------------------------

This may have been due to the fact that both the choir and the audience hated the words. But when, later that year, Strauss introduced the waltz in its orchestral garb to Paris at the World Exhibition, it created a sensation.

When did the Blue Danube Waltz come out?
----------------------------------------

The Blue Danube, the lovely and legendary Strauss waltz which we now associate with loving tribute to the iconic waterway, was composed in 1866. The piece wasn’t an immediate success, falling prey to an unfortunate set of satirical choral lyrics which ridiculed Austria’s loss to Prussia in the Seven Weeks War.

Who was the conductor of the Blue Danube?
-----------------------------------------

Did You Know? J Strauss II made his American debut in Boston on June 17, 1872, conducting The Blue Danube for the World Peace Jubilee. For the occasion, Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore, an Irish bandmaster, assembled an orchestra of 2000 and a choir of 20,000.
