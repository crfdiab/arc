What is a natural cause of oil pollution?
-----------------------------------------

Oil Spill Pollution Causes. Oil spills may originate in natural or anthropogenic causes. Natural causes – such as oil that seeps from the bottom of oceans which enters the marine environment. Crude oil is formed during long periods of time through natural processes involving organic matter from dead organisms.

Are natural oil seeps pollution?
--------------------------------

Here are three little-reported sources of oil that contribute to oil pollution in North American oceans. Natural seeps of oil underneath the Earth’s surface account for 60 percent of the estimated total load in North American waters and 40 percent worldwide, according to the National Academy of Sciences.

How do oil leaks affect the environment?
----------------------------------------

Oil spills are harmful to marine birds and mammals as well as fish and shellfish. Oil destroys the insulating ability of fur-bearing mammals, such as sea otters, and the water repellency of a bird’s feathers, thus exposing these creatures to the harsh elements.

What is the main cause of oil pollution?
----------------------------------------

Oil spills that happen in rivers, bays and the ocean most often are caused by accidents involving tankers, barges, pipelines, refineries, drilling rigs and storage facilities, but also occur from recreational boats and in marinas. Spills can be caused by: people making mistakes or being careless. equipment breaking …

What are the major sources of oil pollution?
--------------------------------------------

Accidental or deliberate, operational discharges and spills of oil from ships, especially tankers, offshore platforms and pipelines, is the most obvious and visible cause of oil pollution of the marine environment.

What are natural oil seeps?
---------------------------

An oil seep is a natural leak of crude oil and gas that migrates up through the seafloor and ocean depths. Natural seeps release oil slowly over time, allowing ecosystems to adapt, whereas oil spills from human activities like commercial oil transport can quickly release oil in quantities that overwhelm an ecosystem.

What are the main sources of oil pollution?
-------------------------------------------

What do oil seeps do to the environment?
----------------------------------------

Oil from underwater seeps generally behaves like oil spilledduring or after extraction, forming large slicks which spread and drift with winds and currents. The slicks can form miles-long lines of black, brown, and tan oil, easily observed from the air. As oil drifts away from seeps and continues to weather, it forms tarballs and mats.

Where does the oil from spilled oil come from?
----------------------------------------------

Once in the ocean, some spilled oil can become co-mingled with oil originating from natural seeps, further complicating the matter. Oil seeps stem from oil fields underneath the seafloor. Oils extracted from these formations may be chemically similar to seep oil, but oil coming from seeps is often more degraded and weathered than spilled oil.

How does an oil spill affect the environment?
---------------------------------------------

As a result, oil from seeps affects fish, birds, and wildlife; can impair surface waters and shorelines; and can impact recreational activities. Cleaning up an oil spill in an area known for having abundant natural seeps, such as the waters off southern California, can be a complicated process.

How do you find seep oil in the ocean?
--------------------------------------

One way to identify seep oil in the ocean is by the consistent pattern of surface expression, which can be traced back to the source from the air. Slicks of seep oil may also be associated with bubbling of natural gas at the ocean surface.
