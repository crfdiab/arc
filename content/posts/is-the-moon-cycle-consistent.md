Is the Moon cycle consistent?
-----------------------------

The Moon completes one orbit around Earth every 27.3 days (a sidereal month), but due to Earth’s orbital motion around the Sun, the Moon does not yet finish a synodic cycle until it has reached the point in its orbit where the Sun is in the same relative position.

Why does the Moon cycle repeat?
-------------------------------

As the moon travels in its 29-day orbit, its position changes daily. Sometimes it’s between the Earth and the sun and sometimes it’s behind us. So a different section of the moon’s face is lit up by the sun, causing it to show different phases.

Does the Moon cycle repeat?
---------------------------

The phases of the moon — new moon, first quarter, full moon and last quarter — repeat themselves about once every month. First of all, the moon revolves around the Earth once every 29.5 days. And secondly, as the moon carries out its voyage around the planet, it’s lit from varying angles by the sun.

How often do the Moon cycle repeat?
-----------------------------------

every 29.5 days  
The Moon passes through four major shapes during a cycle that repeats itself every 29.5 days. The phases always follow one another in the same order.

How does the phase of the Moon change?
--------------------------------------

In this phase the Moon’s illumination is growing smaller each day until the New Moon. During this part of the Moon cycle, the Moon is getting closer to the Sun as viewed from Earth and the night side of the Moon is facing the Earth with only a small edge of the Moon being illuminated.

Why is the menstrual cycle the same length as the Moon?
-------------------------------------------------------

Gerbils avoid foraging at night during a full Moon, because the extra light makes them more likely to be eaten by owls. But the human menstrual cycle is only the same length as the lunar month – it isn’t synchronised with a particular phase.

How does the waning moon cycle affect you?
------------------------------------------

Creativity and intuition can feel heightened. Energy is at a peak. Once the full moon is over, it begins to shrink down again, and this is known as a ‘waning’ moon. As I described above, tasks of wrapping up and completion of a project can flow more easily during this period. Finalize projects, take care of last details during a waning moon cycle.

How long does it take for the waning crescent of the Moon to appear?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

? Waning Crescent: In the Northern Hemisphere, we see the waning crescent phase as a thin crescent of light on the left. The Moon displays these eight phases one after the other as it moves through its cycle each month. It takes 27 days for the Moon to orbit Earth.
