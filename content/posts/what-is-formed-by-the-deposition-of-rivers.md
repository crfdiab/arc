What is formed by the deposition of rivers?
-------------------------------------------

The work of the river is mainly deposition, building up its bed and forming an extensive flood plain. Landforms like braided channels, floodplains, levees, meanders, oxbow lakes, deltas etc. can be seen at this stage.

What is formed when sediment are deposition at the mouth of a river?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The river mouth is where much of this gravel, sand, silt, and clay—called alluvium—is deposited. When large amounts of alluvium are deposited at the mouth of a river, a delta is formed. These sediments form the flat, usually triangle-shaped land of a delta.

What does sediment deposition form?
-----------------------------------

Deposition is the geological process in which sediments, soil and rocks are added to a landform or landmass. Wind, ice, water, and gravity transport previously weathered surface material, which, at the loss of enough kinetic energy in the fluid, is deposited, building up layers of sediment.

Which is formed when sediment is deposited into the still water of a lake or ocean?

Where does most deposition occur in a river?
--------------------------------------------

In rivers, deposition occurs along the inside bank of the river bend \[This “area” is where water flows slower\], while erosion occurs along the outside bank of the bend, where the water flows a lot faster.

What causes sediment to be washed down a river?
-----------------------------------------------

Erosion is the removal and transportation of rock or soil. Erosion can move sediment through water, ice, or wind. Water can wash sediment, such as gravel or pebbles, down from a creek, into a river, and eventually to that river’s delta.

What are the depositional landforms created by rivers?
------------------------------------------------------

The depth of sediments has been reported to be hundreds of metres. For example, the average depth of sediments in Mississippi delta is about 610m. The shape of delta also varies from one river to the other. Common shapes of delta are arcuate shape, bird-foot shape, elongated shape etc.

What causes sediment to be deposited on the surface?
----------------------------------------------------

Wind, ice, water, and gravity transport previously weathered surface material, which, at the loss of enough kinetic energy in the fluid, is deposited, building up layers of sediment. Deposition occurs when the forces responsible for sediment transportation are no longer sufficient to overcome the forces of gravity and friction,…

How is erosion related to the movement of sediment?
---------------------------------------------------

Erosion is the removal and transportation of rock or soil. Erosion can move sediment through water, ice, or wind. Erosion can move sediment through water, ice, or wind. Water can wash sediment, such as gravel or pebble s, down from a creek , into a river , and eventually to that river’s delta .
