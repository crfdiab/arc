Can a planet have no moons?
---------------------------

The answer is no moons at all. That’s right, Venus (and the planet Mercury) are the only two planets that don’t have a single natural moon orbiting them. Figuring out why is one question keeping astronomers busy as they study the Solar System. Astronomers have three explanations about how planets get a moon or moons.

Is it possible for a moon to have a moon?
-----------------------------------------

A subsatellite, also known as a submoon or moonmoon, is a natural or artificial satellite that orbits a natural satellite, i.e. a “moon of a moon”. Nonetheless, aside from human-launched satellites in temporary lunar orbit, no notable “moon of a moon” or subsatellite is known in the Solar System or beyond.

Are there any moons in the Solar System?
----------------------------------------

In the Solar System, we have the central Sun, a great many planets, asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, and moons. While most of the planets have moons, and some of the Kuiper belt objects and even asteroids have natural satellites that orbit them, there are no known “moons of moons” out there.

Is it possible for the Moon to become a planet?
-----------------------------------------------

Sure, asteroid Ceres will become a planet. Pluto’s moon Charon will become a planet. But we’re talking really strange. Eventually, if Earth and its Moon survive long enough, the Moon will have to be reclassified as a planet, said Gregory Laughlin, an extrasolar planet researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Are there any planets that orbit other stars?
---------------------------------------------

There are planets that orbit other stars out in space. And those planets could have moons. Those moons are called exomoons. Exomoons should be common. But efforts to find them have turned up empty so far. One person who wants to know more about these moons is Mario Sucerquia.

Is the Moon going to move outside of Earth?
-------------------------------------------

The answer right now is “yes”. But over time, that barycenter will move outside of Earth. That’s because the Moon is slowly receding from our planet at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters (1.5 inches) a year. It’ll take a long time, but eventually the center of our system’s mass will not be within our planet.
