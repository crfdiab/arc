What are the cause of mangrove destruction?
-------------------------------------------

Many thousands of acres of mangrove forest have been destroyed to make way for rice paddies, rubber trees, palm oil plantations, and other forms of agriculture. Farmers often use fertilizers and chemicals, and runoff containing these pollutants makes its way into water supplies.

What are the major threats to mangroves?
----------------------------------------

“In recent years the biggest regional threats to mangroves are the ever-increasing development of the tourism industry, pollution from runoff of fertilizers and pesticides, and improper disposal of wastes.

What are the harmful effects of mangrove swamp destruction?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Destroying the mangroves contributes to changes in the coastlines such as coastal erosion. The rapid destruction of the mangrove forests for economic activities leads to the increase in the sediment load in the water that leads to the increase in siltation.

What are the four main threats to the mangrove ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------------------

The major threats to mangrove forests include population explosion, conversion to aquaculture ponds, clear-felling for timber, charcoal and wood chip production for industrial and urban development.

What are the environmental impacts of destroying mangroves excessively?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The loss of mangroves contributes to nearly one-fifth of global emissions from deforestation. Climate change also affects their survival. The report indicates that the effects of climate change could result in a loss of a further 10 – 15 per cent of mangroves by year 2100.

How do mangroves affect humans?
-------------------------------

Mangroves are important to people because they help stabilize Florida’s coastline ecosystem and prevent erosion. Mangroves also provide natural infrastructure and protection to nearby populated areas by preventing erosion and absorbing storm surge impacts during extreme weather events such as hurricanes.

What affects mangrove growth?
-----------------------------

As well as salt, other factors that affect mangrove distribution include wave energy, waterlogging, unstable and oxygen-deficient soils, drainage and nutrient levels. Where one species finds tolerable conditions, it tends to become dominant. This has led to the clear zonation among mangrove species.

What are the threats to the mangrove forest?
--------------------------------------------

Business-oriented people are a serious threat for the mangroves Forest. They somehow for the advantages do over-logging, agricultural practices, farming of fish and shrimp etc. in the coastal areas which led to the edge of destruction of the ecosystem.

Why are so many mangrove swamps being destroyed?
------------------------------------------------

Mangrove Destruction. Despite increasing awareness regarding value and importance, the destruction of mangrove swamps continues to take place in many parts of the world under a variety of economic as-well-as political motives.

Why are mangroves important to the coastal ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------------------

The mangroves act as shields and protect the inner coastal areas from destruction caused due to cyclones or storms. Thus, the mangroves have an important role in sustaining and preserving coastal ecosystem. The threats posed by human activities can upset the natural balance and cause their depletion.

Why are water diversions bad for the mangroves?
-----------------------------------------------

These water diversions alter the natural flow of water that maintains the health of surrounding mangroves as well as ecosystems farther inland and offshore. Diverting water can harm mangroves by preventing their seeds from being dispersed via seawater, and it can kill the trees by cutting off freshwater supplies.
