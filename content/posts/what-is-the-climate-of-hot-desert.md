What is the climate of hot desert?
----------------------------------

A hot desert is a part of the world that has high average temperatures and very low precipitation. These areas need to have less than 250mm of rainfall per year to be classified as a desert.

Where the climate is hot and dry?
---------------------------------

Very high daytime temperatures, with very little precipitation and a short and mild winter season characterize this climate. Another important characteristic is a high diurnal temperature variation. You can be boiling during the day and cold at night.

What is a hot dry climate called?
---------------------------------

Dry climates, otherwise known as arid or semi-arid climates, have very little rainfall throughout the year. Deserts are often found in dry climates and they remain dry during the winter seasons. Yearly temperature in dry-hot climates is usually above 64 degrees Fahrenheit.

Why is the desert so hot?
-------------------------

But what makes it so hot in a desert? Deserts occur where there is a lack of moisture and thus an abundance of sunlight. With no evaporative cooling and a relative lack of vegetation to use the sunlight, most all of the sunlight goes into warming the ground surface. This causes very hot afternoon temperatures.

Where is hot and dry?
---------------------

Hot and dry desert. The four major North American deserts of this type are the Chihuahuan, Sonoran, Mojave and Great Basin. Others outside the U.S. include the Southern Asian realm, Neotropical (South and Central America), Ethiopian (Africa) and Australian.

What is the climate like in the desert?
---------------------------------------

Generally, the climate in these areas is hot, dry, and sunny throughout the year. In summer, the maximum temperature may soar to 40 0C and the hottest regions sometimes experience temperatures exceeding 45 0C.

Which is colder the hot desert or the cold desert?
--------------------------------------------------

Though hot in the summer, it shares the very cold winters of the rest of Central Asia. Cold desert climates are typically found at higher altitudes than hot desert climates and are usually drier than hot desert climates.

What kind of vegetation does the hot desert have?
-------------------------------------------------

The veg­etation of hot desert climate is of xerophytic type which has special characteristics to withstand harsh climate characterized by extreme aridity, high tem­perature and very high rate of evaporation.

What’s the difference between hot and dry climate?
--------------------------------------------------

• Hot and dry (mean monthly temperature &gt;30 and relatively humidity &lt;55%). • Warm and humid (mean monthly temperature &gt;25-30 and relatively humidity &lt;55-75%). • Cold and dry (mean monthly temperature &lt;25 and relatively humidity- all values).
