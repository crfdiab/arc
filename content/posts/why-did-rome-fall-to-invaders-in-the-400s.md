Why did Rome fall to invaders in the 400s?
------------------------------------------

Why did Rome fall to invaders in the 400s? The emperors were weak and military leaders were busy fighting among themselves, which allowed a foreign general to overthrow the last emperor in Rome and name himself king of Italy. Germanic farmers were invited to farm the land; in turn they ignored Roman emperors.

What disease brought down the Roman Empire?
-------------------------------------------

Antonine Plague  
The Antonine Plague of 165 to 180 AD, also known as the Plague of Galen (after Galen, the physician who described it), was an ancient pandemic brought to the Roman Empire by troops who were returning from campaigns in the Near East. Scholars have suspected it to have been either smallpox or measles.

Why did the barbarians hate Rome?
---------------------------------

The Visigoths had another big reason to dislike Rome. Emperor Valens had promised them that they could be given land and slaves if they could control all the other barbarians along the Danube River. But Rome was suffering from a financial crisis. Eventually, they began to attack Rome but it took some time.

Why did the Romans want to invade Britain?
------------------------------------------

Roman military leaders were often enthusiastic about conquering new territories…

Why did the Germanic tribes invade the Roman Empire?
----------------------------------------------------

The Barbarian attacks on Rome partially stemmed from a mass migration caused by the Huns’ invasion of Europe in the late fourth century. When these Eurasian warriors rampaged through northern Europe, they drove many Germanic tribes to the borders of the Roman Empire.

Why was the Roman conquest of Italy so important?
-------------------------------------------------

The successful conquest of Italy gave Rome access to a manpower pool unrivalled by any contemporary state and paved the way to the eventual Roman domination of the entire Mediterranean world.

Why was the decline of the Roman empire inevitable?
---------------------------------------------------

“The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness…… The story of its ruin (downfall) is simple and obvious; and instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long.”. The fall of Rome is an example of the domino effect.
