What is the difference between glass and Pyrex?
-----------------------------------------------

Glass vs Pyrex The difference between glass and pyrex is that pyrex is more strong, fire-proof, which means that it can withstand greater temperature fluctuations and shatterproof as well when compared to normal glasses which cannot handle such temperature fluctuations.

What is special about Pyrex glass?
----------------------------------

Pyrex pieces used to be made of borosilicate glass, which is more resistant to breakage when subjected to extreme shifts in temperature. Although tempered glass can better withstand thermal shock than regular soda-lime glass can, it’s not as resilient to such stress as borosilicate.

Why did Pyrex stop using borosilicate?
--------------------------------------

In 1998, Corning sold the Pyrex brand to World Kitchen LLC, which stopped using borosilicate glass and started using soda-lime glass, according to Consumer Reports. Soda-lime glass is just ordinary glass. It’s not resistant to thermal-shock, and it could shatter when going from one temperature extreme to another.

Are Pyrex materials made of glass?
----------------------------------

Pyrex, (trademark), a type of glass and glassware that is resistant to heat, chemicals, and electricity. It is used to make chemical apparatus, industrial equipment, including piping and thermometers, and ovenware.

Can I pour boiling water into Pyrex?
------------------------------------

Even heat-resistant glasses like Pyrex can shatter when poured with boiling water incorrectly. To prevent the glass from cracking when exposed to boiling water, you should avoid extreme and abrupt changes in temperature.

Is Pyrex a good brand?
----------------------

Pyrex products made from borosilicate glass are widely trusted and among the highest quality glassware available to customers.

Is Pyrex expensive?
-------------------

Pyrex patterns are classified as Standard or Promotional. As you can imagine, promotional Pyrex patterns can be quite expensive. In fact, the Pyrex pattern that’s the most in demand can go for upwards of $4,000 and is called Lucky in Love. If you ever find one of these pieces, you’ll be lucky indeed.

Is Pyrex unsafe?
----------------

Safer Dishware and Food Storage It’s affordable, good quality, and very safe. Pyrex did briefly make a line called Vintage Charm that was inspired by the vintage pieces but would fit under new FDA standards.

Is Pyrex no longer made?
------------------------

Pyrex (trademarked as PYREX and pyrex) is a brand introduced by Corning Inc. in 1915 for a line of clear, low-thermal-expansion borosilicate glass used for laboratory glassware and kitchenware. Corning Inc. no longer manufactures or markets consumer products, only industrial ones.

Is Pyrex glass good?
--------------------

Borosilicate PYREX Glass has excellent thermal shock resistance. It does not expand or contract like ordinary Soda-Lime glass does when exposed to rapid changes in heat or cold. The company that bought the PYREX® trademark for European use continues to make Borosilicate Glass PYREX.

What kind of materials are used to make Pyrex glass?
----------------------------------------------------

Pyrex glass is a borosilicate glass first produced by The Corning Glass Works company. It is made by heating raw materials like silica sand and boric oxide to extremely high temperatures for extended periods of time.

What’s the difference between glass and Pyrex molding?
------------------------------------------------------

Pyrex is made by the low coefficient expansion of borosilicate glass whereas glass is blown and pressed to prepare it for the molding process. When ordinary glass acquires some new characteristics due to some tempering and other processes, it is called Pyrex.

What makes up the molecular structure of Pyrex?
-----------------------------------------------

Boric oxide is responsible for the unique Pyrex molecular structure. Boric oxide makes up anywhere from 5% to 20% of Pyrex glass. Secondary ingredients used in glass production include fluxes, stabilizers, and colorants. Fluxes are included in glass mixtures because they reduce the melting temperature of the borosilicate glass.

When did Pyrex start using borosilicate glass?
----------------------------------------------

Seven years later, Pyrex cookware hit the American market. The company referred to its products as “fire-glass” in early ads. These dates are important because Corning’s patent on the borosilicate glass used to make Pyrex pans expired in 1936.
