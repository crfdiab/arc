Which ocean is more salt Atlantic or Pacific?
---------------------------------------------

As oceanographers have known for many years—but now can “see”—the Atlantic Ocean is saltier than the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Near most coastlines and inland seas in the map, waters appear much fresher or saltier than in open-ocean locations.

Why Pacific Ocean is called Pacific?
------------------------------------

Explorer Ferdinand Magellan named the Pacific Ocean in the 16th Century. He called this body of water pacific, due to the calmness of the water at the time (‘pacific’ means peaceful). When Magellan and his crew entered the Pacific Ocean after their long journey, they thought that the Spice Islands were close at hand.

Why is the Atlantic Ocean the saltiest?
---------------------------------------

Of the five ocean basins, the Atlantic Ocean is the saltiest. Fresh water, in the form of water vapor, moves from the ocean to the atmosphere through evaporation causing the higher salinity. Toward the poles, fresh water from melting ice decreases the surface salinity once again.

Why is the Pacific ocean more clear than the Atlantic?
------------------------------------------------------

That’s when the warmer surface temperatures of the ocean move further out to sea and are replaced with deeper, colder and more sediment-rich waters. The Pacific Ocean is huge and turns a lot of water brownish-gray as a result of upwelling. Cloudier, gray water is more nutrient-rich than clear, sparkling water.

Why is it easier to float in sea water?
---------------------------------------

The extreme example would be the Dead Sea, which has about 10–12X as much salt as sea water does. In the Dead Sea you can float with your arms and legs out of the water. Just your torso is displacing enough of the fluid to keep you afloat.

Which is bigger the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean?
--------------------------------------------------------

In England you float more in the sea than you do in Peru. My conclusion was that there was more salt in the Atlantic than the Pacific. The Atlantic is the second largest ocean in the world, but over half the rivers flow in to it. The Pacific is the biggest ocean in the world.

Which is saltier the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean?
---------------------------------------------------------

The Atlantic is the world’s saltiest ocean and it is at its saltiest in the North Atlantic where it is 37 parts salt to a thousand parts of water. The Pacific averages about 34 parts salt to water, but its highest areas of salinity is in equatorial areas.

Why is it so easy to float in the Dead Sea?
-------------------------------------------

The Dead Sea is not really a sea at all, but rather a salt lake, bordered by Jordan and Israel. It is the seventh saltiest body of water on Earth— the Don Juan Pond in Antarctica is the saltiest. You’ve probably heard that floating in the ocean is significantly easier than floating in fresh water, just because the ocean is comprised of salt water.
