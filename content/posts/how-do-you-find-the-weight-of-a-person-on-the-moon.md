How do you find the weight of a person on the moon?
---------------------------------------------------

Calculating Your Weight on the Moon Multiply your weight by the moon’s gravity relative to earth’s, which is 0.165. Solve the equation. In the example, you would obtain the product 22.28 lbs. So a person weighing 135 pounds on Earth would weigh just over 22 pounds on the moon.

How much would a 70kg man weigh on the moon what would be his mass on the Earth and on the moon?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hence the weight of the man on the moon will be 114.1 Newtons which is the actual unit of weight of the man. Now the mass of the man will be constant irrespective of whether he is on the Earth or on the moon since mass is an intrinsic property of matter. Hence the mass of man on Earth and the moon will be 70 kg.

How to calculate the weight of an object on the Moon?
-----------------------------------------------------

The weight of the first object on the Earth is 90 pounds but on the moon, it is 15 pounds. This gives us a ratio between the relative gravitational field strengths of the Earth and the moon, In other words, your weight on the moon is 1 6 of what it is on Earth. Thus we multiply the mass of the heavier object (algebraically) like this:

How much does a woman weigh on the Moon?
----------------------------------------

Weight on the moon A woman has a mass of 55.0 kg. (a) What is her weight on earth? (b) What are her mass and her weight on the moon, where g = 1.62 ms–2? Solution: (a) On earth ! ! W = m g = 55.0 x 9.8 = 539 N (b) On moon, her mass remains the same, but the acceleration due to gravity is different, so W = m gm= 55.0 x 1.62 = 89.1 N Title

What is the weight of 80 kg on the Moon?
----------------------------------------

So the weight of the same 80 kg mass on the moon is 133.28 N. Start your 48-hour free trial and unlock all the summaries, Q&amp;A, and analyses you need to get better grades now. Already a member? Log in here.

How big is the acceleration on the Moon?
----------------------------------------

The acceleration due to gravity on the moon is 1.6 N/Kg. An astronaut weighs 670N on the earth’s surface A. Find the mass of the astronaut B. His weight on the moon’s surface. The acceleration due to gravity on the Moon’s surface is one-sixth that on Earth.
