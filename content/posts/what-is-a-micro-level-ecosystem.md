What is a micro level ecosystem?
--------------------------------

Micro-level ecosystems are local areas such a specific mountain or valley (Barnes et al. 1998). As one moves from the macro-level ecosystems to the micro-level ecosystems we reduce the amount of complexity. That is to say that the micro-level ecosystems are more homogenous than the macro- and meso-level ecosystems.

What are the processes of ecosystems?
-------------------------------------

Ecological processes such as primary production, respiration, energy, carbon and nutrient flow through food webs, reproduction, and decomposition are represented as rates of change, which requires repeated measurement over time.

What is needed for a self-sustaining ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------------

What Factors Are Needed to Have a Self-Sustaining Ecosystem? Just like any ecosystem, a self-sustaining ecosystem needs light for primary production and nutrient cycling. The environment must find an ecological balance and be able to support the survival and reproduction of all organisms living inside it.

Which is an example of a micro ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------

Micro Ecosystem – It refers to the ecosystem, which are very small like pond ecosystems, communities living under a rock, etc. Meso Ecosystem – It refers to the ecosystem, which are of medium size like large lakes, etc. Macro Ecosystem – It refers to the ecosystem, which is of large size like the entire rainforest.

How does a microorganism get its energy from?
---------------------------------------------

Microorganisms are classified as autotrophs or heterotrophs based on whether or not they require pre-formed organic matter. Autotrophs derive energy from either light absorption (photoautotrophs) or oxidation of inorganic molecules (chemoautotrophs).

What are the roles of microbes in an ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------------

1 (1) Generate Oxygen in the Atmosphere. 2 (2) Recycle nutrients stored in organic matter to an inorganic form. 3 (3) Fix nitrogen from the Atmosphere into a Useable Form. 4 (4) Allow Herbivores to Consume Poor Quality Food. 5 (5) Give Plant Roots Access to Nutrients in the Soil.

What do microbes need to grow and reproduce?
--------------------------------------------

Microbes must acquire certain elements to grow and reproduce — these elements compose their protoplasm in the proportions listed in the table above. In addition, they must produce ATP in order to use the stored energy in this molecule to operate various cellular processes.
