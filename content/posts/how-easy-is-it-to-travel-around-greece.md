How easy is it to travel around Greece?
---------------------------------------

Getting Around the Greek Islands Traveling by ferry makes island hopping simple, especially if you’re staying within one archipelago. It is possible, of course, to rent a car in Athens — or on one of the islands — and drive it onto the ferry, essentially turning your island hopping excursion into a seafaring road trip.

If you have a couple weeks to spare while traveling Greece one of my best Greek travel tips is to hit up a few islands instead of spending all your time on one. Some of the islands are only one hour apart by ferry, while some may take all day. Do your research on sites like Ferry Hopper and see what is best for you.

Can you go to more than one island in Greece?
---------------------------------------------

These days most people tend to stick to one island per trip (the golden age of Greek island hopping was back in the 70s and 80s).
