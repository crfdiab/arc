George Custer’s entire direct command wiped out by Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors, exactly 144 years ago today. At the conclusion of the ceremony, an old Lakota warrior named White Bull stepped forward and handed his tomahawk to retired Gen. Edward Godfrey, who had served as a lieutenant in the battle.

How did Custer lose?
--------------------

Custer was defeated at the Battle of the Little Bighorn because he made a lot of fundamental errors. He acted alone – even though Gibbon’s last words to him were – Custer, don’t be greedy. Wait for us. Instead of going round the Wolf Mountains, Custer force-marched his men through the mountains.

Who was the chief of the Lakota tribe that defeated Custer?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Why did Custer want to be an Indian fighter?

Who was in charge of the army at Custer’s last stand?
-----------------------------------------------------

The U.S. Army dispatched three columns of soldiers, including Custer and his 7th Cavalry, to round up the Indians and return them to their reservations. The plan was for Custer’s cavalry and Brigadier General Alfred Terry’s infantry to rendezvous with troops under the command of Colonel John Gibbon and Brigadier General George Crook.
