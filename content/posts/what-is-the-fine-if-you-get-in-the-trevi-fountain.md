Do Trevi Fountain wishes come true?

In 2016, an estimated €1.4 million (US$1.5 million) was thrown into the fountain.

When is the best time to go to the Trevi Fountain?
--------------------------------------------------

If you want pictures with the fountain, you might have a chance – but you’ll likely have to wait in line and deal with a lot of teenagers trying to snap 100+ selfies. In my opinion, the absolute best time to visit the Trevi Fountain is early in the morning before the crowds arrive.
