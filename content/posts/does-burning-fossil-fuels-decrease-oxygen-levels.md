Does burning fossil fuels decrease oxygen levels?
-------------------------------------------------

Today, burning billions of tons of stored carbon in fossil fuels is removing large amounts of oxygen from the atmosphere, reversing the pattern that drove the rise in oxygen. And so the oxygen level in the atmosphere falls as the concentration of carbon dioxide rises.

How does the burning of fossil fuels affect the carbon oxygen balance?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

“\[Plants\] uptake oxygen in photosynthesis and release it in respiration so they don’t alter the oxygen balance in a stable biosphere,” says Fraser. “As you burn fossil fuels and create carbon dioxide you actually remove an equivalent amount of oxygen from the atmosphere,” says Fraser.

Why is oxygen decreasing?
-------------------------

Oxygen levels are decreasing globally due to fossil-fuel burning. The changes are too small to have an impact on human health, but are of interest to the study of climate change and carbon dioxide. This corresponds to losing 19 O2 molecules out of every 1 million O2 molecules in the atmosphere each year.

Is oxygen a fossil fuel?
------------------------

Fossil fuels are hydrocarbons comprised primarily of the following elements: carbon and hydrogen and some sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen, and mineral matter.

What is the lowest oxygen concentration that can support human life?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

19.5 percent  
The minimum oxygen concentration in the air required for human breathing is 19.5 percent. The human body takes the oxygen breathed in from the lungs and transports it to the other parts of the body via the body’s red blood cells. Each cell uses and requires oxygen to thrive.

Are we losing oxygen?
---------------------

Oxygen makes up one-fifth of the air we breathe, but it’s the most vital component – and it does seem to be declining. The main cause is the burning of fossil fuels, which consumes free oxygen. Fortunately, the atmosphere contains so much oxygen that we’re in no danger of running out soon.

How does the burning of fossil fuels affect the climate?
--------------------------------------------------------

But too many greenhouse gases can cause too much warming. The burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil increase the amount of CO 2 in our air. This happens because the burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO 2. It’s important that we monitor CO 2 levels, because too much CO 2 can cause too much warming on Earth.

Why is the O2 level in the atmosphere decreasing?
-------------------------------------------------

Atmospheric O2 is Decreasing Burning carbon requires oxygen (O2), and when we burn an atom of carbon, the required oxygen becomes part of the CO2 molecule. So if the CO2 increase is caused by burning carbon (fossil fuels), we would expect atmospheric O2 levels to decrease at the same rate.

What is causing the increase in atmospheric CO2?
------------------------------------------------

There are many lines of evidence which clearly show that the atmospheric CO2 increase is caused by humans. The clearest of these is simple accounting – humans are emitting CO2 at a rate twice as fast as the atmospheric increase (natural sinks are absorbing the other half). There is no question whatsoever that the CO2 increase is human-caused.

Why are volcanoes a significant source of carbon dioxide?
---------------------------------------------------------

“If volcanoes were a significant source of carbon dioxide then you’d have a big spike in the growth rate corresponding to when the volcano goes off. We don’t see that, it’s just a steady increase.” “The amount of carbon that volcanoes emit is just not enough.
