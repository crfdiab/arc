Can invasive species be accidentally introduced?
------------------------------------------------

Many invasive species are introduced into a new region accidentally. Zebra mussels arrived in the Great Lakes of North America accidentally, stuck to large ships that traveled between the two regions. There are now so many zebra mussels in the Great Lakes that they have threatened native species.

Do invasive species have to come from another country?
------------------------------------------------------

Species that grow and reproduce quickly, and spread aggressively, with potential to cause harm, are given the label “invasive.” An invasive species does not have to come from another country.

Why do some species introduced to a new area become invasive?
-------------------------------------------------------------

An introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for resources such as nutrients, light, physical space, water, or food. If these species evolved under great competition or predation, then the new environment may host fewer able competitors, allowing the invader to proliferate quickly.

How do invasive species travel from one country to another?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Species can become unintentionally transported globally, by catching a ride in places like ship ballast water, or locally, by attaching to boats or other equipment used by anglers and hunters. Imported: Intentionally imported species are not usually intended for widespread distribution into the environment.

How are invasive species introduced into new regions?
-----------------------------------------------------

It must harm property, the economy, or the native plants and animals of the region. Many invasive species are introduced into a new region accidentally. Zebra mussel s are native to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea in Central Asia.

Are there any invasive species that are native to Asia?
-------------------------------------------------------

Some species have been introduced, intentionally or not, in habitats and lands where they do not belong, sometimes with disastrous consequences. 1. Burmese python (Photo: Hannes Steyn / Flickr / CC BY-SA 2.0) Burmese pythons are, as their name suggests, native to Southern and South Eastern Asian tropical and subtropical regions.

How did zebra mussels become an invasive species?
-------------------------------------------------

To be invasive, a species must adapt to the new area easily. It must reproduce quickly. It must harm property, the economy, or the native plants and animals of the region. Many invasive species are introduced into a new region accidentally. Zebra mussel s are native to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea in Central Asia.

What are some examples of humans importing invasive species?
------------------------------------------------------------

They have outcompeted other, native species – for example, the malaria and yellow fever mosquito in Calcutta – and have sometimes filled a previously empty niche with no native species to compete with – for example in Europe. 8. Whiteflies (Photo: Scot Nelson / Flickr / CC BY 2.0)
