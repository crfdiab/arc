What continent do we think most early humans came from?
-------------------------------------------------------

As the gaps are filled, the story is likely to change, but in broad outline, today’s scientists believe that from their beginnings in Africa, the modern humans went first to Asia between 80,000 and 60,000 years ago. By 45,000 years ago, or possibly earlier, they had settled Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia.

When did the first human appear on Earth?

There’s a lot anthropologists still don’t know about how different groups …

When did modern humans come out of Africa?
------------------------------------------

Genetic studies also support the idea of earlier dispersals of modern humans out of Africa starting from about 220,000 years ago. There is also evidence in the form of stone tools that indicate the possibility that earlier dispersals reached beyond the Levant.

Where did the first migration of humans take place?

This initial migration was followed by other archaic humans including H.

When did the first humans arrive in Southeast Asia?
---------------------------------------------------

Archaeological evidence shows that modern humans had reached Southeast Asia by 70,000 years ago, however the oldest securely dated modern human remains are only about 40,000 years old. This species is one of the best known of our ancestors.
