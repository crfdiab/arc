--------------------------------------

The Semiarid climates are found in sections of the Great Plains regions, parts of Texas, New Mexico, the intermontane basin of Nevada, parts of eastern Washington and Oregon, and sections of neighboring states. This climate is a transitional one between the desert types and the humid types.

What makes an area a semi arid climate?
---------------------------------------

An area is considered semiarid if it averages between 10-20 inches of rain annually (yearly). Some years these places may get 20-40 inches of rain, but sometimes 5-10–this is why they are semi-arid and dangerous for human settlement. Similar to Arid climate, Semiarid climate’s precipitation levels are due to ocean currents.

What’s the weather like in the inland region of Texas?

The winters in the inland region are variable, but usually mild. Snow is a rare occurrence due to the lack of humidity in winter, and the summers are for the most part hot and dry, but at times can be humid when winds come off the Gulf of Mexico.
