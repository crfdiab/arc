What type of resource is hydroelectricity?
------------------------------------------

It is a form of energyâ€”a renewable resource. Hydropower provides about 96 per cent of the renewable energy in the United States. Other renewable resources include geothermal, wave power, tidal power, wind power, and solar power.

Is nuclear a renewable resource?
--------------------------------

Nuclear energy is usually considered another non-renewable energy source. Although nuclear energy itself is a renewable energy source, the material used in nuclear power plants is not. Nuclear energy is released through nuclear fission, the process where the nucleus of an atom splits.

Where does the energy for hydroelectricity come from?
-----------------------------------------------------

Hydroelectricity relies on water, which is a clean, renewable energy source. A renewable source of energy is one that will not run out. Renewable energy comes from natural sources, like wind, sunlight, rain, tides, and geothermal energy (the heat produced inside the Earth).

When did the world agree that hydroelectric power is renewable?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Representatives of more than 170 countries reached consensus at the Top World Conference on Sustainable Development, in Johannesburg (2002), and at the 3rd World Forum on Water, in Kyoto (2003): hydroelectric generation is renewable and has certain merits Here are ten reasons leading them to this conclusion. 1.

How is hydroelectric power good for the environment?
----------------------------------------------------

Hydroelectric power for the Nation 1 Fuel is not burned so there is minimal pollution 2 Water to run the power plant is provided free by nature 3 Hydropower plays a major role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions 4 Relatively low operations and maintenance costs 5 The technology is reliable and proven over time

How are hydroelectric power plants different from other types of power plants?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the blades of the turbine spin, they power a generator. Another type of hydroelectric energy plant is a diversion facility. This type of plant is unique because it does not use a dam. Instead, it uses a series of canals to channel flowing river water toward the generator-powering turbines.
