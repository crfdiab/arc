What are decomposers in the ocean food chain?
---------------------------------------------

Decomposers. Decomposers exist on every trophic level. They are mainly bacteria that break down dead organisms. This process releases nutrients to support the producers as well as the consumers that feed through absorbing organic material in the water column.

What are the decomposers in the Pacific ocean?
----------------------------------------------

Decomposer. A few decomposers of the ocean would be bacteria, fungus, marine worms, sea slugs, sea worms, and brittle stars.

Are crabs decomposers in the ocean?
-----------------------------------

Crustaceans and Molluscs Similar to the echinoderms, many molluscs and crustacean creatures like clams, mussels, crabs, shrimp, etc., are also macrodecomposers, which feed and convert decaying organic matter floating around in the seawater, thereby sustaining the food cycle, and maintaining the underwater ecosystems.

What are 5 Ocean decomposers?
-----------------------------

Overall, the main decomposer organisms in marine ecosystems are bacteria. Other important decomposers are fungi, marine worms, echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks.

What are the different types of decomposers in the ocean?
---------------------------------------------------------

Various types of decomposers include lobsters, starfish, shrimp, crabs, sea slugs and worms. Their main function is to break down wastes of other oceanic living things. Decomposers break down what is left of nutrients, and recycle the remains back into the food chain. Also, these recyclers feed on decaying or dead organisms.

What kind of food does a decomposer eat?
----------------------------------------

Photic zone- zone in which sunlight reaches the ocean floor. In this particular area phytoplankon absorb and utilize sunlight, while whales feed on them. 4. Aphotic zone- zone in which no sunlight is available. Home to many decomposers that feed on dead matter on the ocean floor.

Who are the decomposers of the abyssal zone?
--------------------------------------------

Abyssal zone known as the home for many decomposers which feed on bits and pieces of dead stuff that sink down to the bottom. The decompsers that we can found in Abyssal zone are : 1. Bacteria. Bacteria are a type of microbe, or organism so small that it can only be seen with the use of a microscope.

Where does decomposition take place in the ocean?
-------------------------------------------------

The majority of decomposition occurs on the floor of the ocean because organisms tend to sink after they die. Some of the nutrients that decomposers help release back into the ocean are phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium. Organisms belonging to another class of marine life, the producers,â€¦
