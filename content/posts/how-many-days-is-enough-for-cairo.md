How many days is enough for Cairo?
----------------------------------

So bottom line is give Cairo at least 2 days and Luxor at least one additional day if not 2. So that’s 2-4 days total for doing Egypt as an add-on when you’re already in the region. Now, for those who are flying across the ocean to visit Egypt, you’ll want to stay a little longer.
