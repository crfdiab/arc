What is the definition of global grid in geography?
---------------------------------------------------

The global grid consists of imaginary lines of latitude and longitude (see Figure 1). Latitude lines go across the map â€” latitude comes from the Latin latitudo, meaning breadth, or the measure of the side-to-side dimension of a solid.

What is a global grid simple definition?
----------------------------------------

An open systems architecture that provides global connectivity instantaneously on warrior demand. The global grid can support both vertical and horizontal information flow to joint and multinational forces. See also common operating environment; node/command, control, communications, and computers node.

What is a global grid answer?
-----------------------------

Answer: global grid. An open systems architecture that provides global connectivity instantaneously on warrior demand. The global grid can support both vertical and horizontal information flow to joint and multinational forces. The global grid system uses both the parallels of latitude and the meridian of longitude.

What is the function of the global grid?
----------------------------------------

Discrete Global Grids are used as the geometric basis for the building of geospatial data structures. Each cell is related with data objects or values, or (in the hierarchical case) may be associated with other cells.

How do you use global grid to find places in the world?
-------------------------------------------------------

The global grid system uses both the parallels of latitude and the meridian of longitude. When giving a location in latitude and longitude, latitude is always first. As an example, the location for New Orleans is 30 N, 90 W. This is read as 30 degrees north latitude, and 90 degrees west longitude.

What is the global grid made of?
--------------------------------

The global grid system, which is made up of lines of latitude and longitude, help people find the absolute location of a place.

What is the significance of grid and time?
------------------------------------------

The grid lines act here as a guide to place your elements, position and at the same time scale them, instead of randomly placing your elements, consuming more of our time. Think grid as the foundation to your layout, its one of the first thing you lay down and then build upon your story.

Why is 400 kV used?
-------------------

It is first stepped up to 400 kV by a transformer and then transmitted across the country in aluminium cables roughly 2 cm in diameter. High voltages are used because the power loss per kilometre (I2R) for a given power output will be much less at high voltage and low current than at low voltage and high current.
