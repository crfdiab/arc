Why should we not melt glaciers?
--------------------------------

Melting glaciers add to rising sea levels, which in turn increases coastal erosion and elevates storm surge as warming air and ocean temperatures create more frequent and intense coastal storms like hurricanes and typhoons.

What happens to glaciers during warm weather?
---------------------------------------------

Heat-trapping gases, sometimes called “greenhouse gases,” are the cause of most of the climate warming and glacier retreat in the past 50 years. If all the lost or gained glacial ice were converted to water and spread evenly over glacier surface area, the depth of that water layer is the water equivalence.

Are there glaciers on Earth that are growing?
---------------------------------------------

In the midst of global warming, some glaciers on our planet appear to be growing instead of shrinking. The volcanic Mount Shasta in the U.S. state of California is home to several growing glaciers, despite rising temperatures in the region. Glaciers are literally big, moving ice cubes.

What happens to the glacier when it snows?
------------------------------------------

This snow will settle down, and when it snows again the lower layer of snow gets compressed. Every time it snows, the below layers will compress more, finally turning into hard ice. This ice is what forms the glacier. When the temperature rises slightly, the outer edges of the formed glacier and fresh snow will melt.

Where does the velocity of glacial ice change?
----------------------------------------------

The velocity of glacial ice changes throughout the glacier. The velocity is low next to the base of the glacier and where it is contact with valley walls. The velocity increases toward the center and upper parts of the glacier. Glaciation Glaciation:

Why are the glaciers in the Arctic colder than the equator?
-----------------------------------------------------------

In theory, the Arctic remains colder than the equator because more of the heat from the sun is reflected off the ice, back into space. Glaciers around the world can range from ice that is several hundred to several thousand years old and provide a scientific record of how climate has changed over time.
