What are the southwestern states of the United States?
------------------------------------------------------

The southwestern United States, also known as the American Southwest or simply the Southwest, is a geographic and cultural region of the United States that generally includes Arizona, New Mexico, and adjacent portions of California, Colorado, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah.

Why did California become part of the United States?
----------------------------------------------------

Why did California became a state? In 1849, Californians sought statehood and, after heated debate in the U.S. Congress arising out of the slavery issue, California entered the Union as a free, nonslavery state by the Compromise of 1850.

When did people first come to the southwest?
--------------------------------------------

Long before the appearance of the first Spanish explorers in the 1500s, the Southwest was inhabited by a variety of native populations. Groups of hunters walked here across the Bering Straits over a land bridge that once joined Asia with North America; estimates of when that occurred range from 15,000 to 35,000 years ago.

Where did the Spanish divide California into two parts?
-------------------------------------------------------

The Spanish divided California into two parts, Baja California and Alta California, as provinces of New Spain (Mexico). Baja or lower California consisted of the Baja Peninsula and terminated roughly at San Diego, California, where Alta California started.

How did the US gain control of the southwest?
---------------------------------------------

The United States, undergoing a period of expansion, annexed the Republic of Texas, which initiated a war with Mexico for control of much of the Southwest. After the war between the U.S. and Mexico (1846-1848), the U.S. negotiated to receive lands that became the states we know as New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado.
