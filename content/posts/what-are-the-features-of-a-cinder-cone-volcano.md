What are the features of a cinder cone volcano?
-----------------------------------------------

Cinder cones are the simplest type of volcano. They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone.

What is intrusive and Extrusive vulcanicity?
--------------------------------------------

, geologist. Intrusive – MAGMA solidifies underground e.g. sills, dykes, batholith. Extrusive – LAVA ejected onto the surface of the earth before solidification – e.g. lava flows, nuee ardente, even volcanic plugs.

What is the internal structure of a cinder cone?
------------------------------------------------

Schematic of the internal structure of a typical cinder cone A cinder cone is a steep conical hill of loose pyroclastic fragments, such as volcanic clinkers, volcanic ash, or cinder that has been built around a volcanic vent. The pyroclastic fragments are formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single, typically cylindrical, vent.

What kind of volcano is a cinder cone?
--------------------------------------

Cinder cones are also known as ash cones. Cinder cones are the type of volcano that is formed by pyroclastic fragments like volcanic ashes, solidified lava pieces, volcanic clinkers, pumice and hot gases. These volcanoes are formed around the volcanic vent and are known to be the simplest form of a volcano.

Where are the cinder cones in the US?
-------------------------------------

…and Preserve, region of volcanic cones, craters, and lava flows near the foot of the Pioneer Mountains in south-central Idaho, U.S., 18 miles (29 km) southwest of Arco. …is centred on a truncated cinder cone, the remnant of an extinct volcano, that rises 1,000 feet (300 metres) above the surrounding area.

How long does it take a cinder cone to form?
--------------------------------------------

Cinder cones are formed when the gas-charged lava is blown with a great force into the air; it breaks into small fragments and solidifies. This solidified material builds up a circular or oval-shaped cone with a bowl-shaped crater at the top. They grow rapidly and in some cases it’s been recorded that cinder cones grow up 1,000 feet.
