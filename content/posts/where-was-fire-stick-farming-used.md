Where was fire stick farming used?
----------------------------------

Currently, most fire stick farming occurs in the NT, northern QLD and northern WA. In 2018, for example, there were nearly 80 cultural burns across savannas in northern Australia.

How long has Firestick farming been around?
-------------------------------------------

It has taken 200 years for the fire-stick to be recognised as the agricultural instrument that it had been for up to 60,000 years or more before European colonisation. Penny Van Oosterzee, 1993, The Centre – The Natural history of Australia’s Desert Regions, Reed Australia.

When did cultural burning start?
--------------------------------

Other indigenous peoples applied the same technique, for example the Indigenous Peoples of Canada. The Northern Territory started supporting cultural burns on public lands from the early 1980s, New South Wales not before 2017.

What are the disadvantages of Firestick farming?
------------------------------------------------

CON’S

- It pollutes the air: The smoke from the fires can pollute the air and cause health problems.
- It can kill animals: Land animals might die when people burn off because they can’t climb trees or get away fast enough or even go into their burrows because they will get cooked as a result of the heat. Is Firestick farming still used today?
    --------------------------------------
    
    Current use While it has been discontinued in many parts of Australia, it has been reintroduced to some Aboriginal groups by the teachings of custodians from areas where the practice is extant in continuous unbroken tradition, such as the Noongar peoples’ cold fire.

    What are the reasons for cultural burning?
    ------------------------------------------
    
    Cultural Burning practices were developed by Aboriginal people to enhance the health of the land and its people. It includes burning (or prevention of burning) for the health of particular plants and animals.
    
    Who invented fire stick farming?
    --------------------------------
    
    Fire-stick farming are words used by Australian archaeologist Rhys Jones in 1969. They describe the way that Indigenous Australians used fire regularly to burn the land. This helped hunting by herding the animals into particular areas, and also caused new grass to grow which attracted more animals.
    
    Why is Firestick farming important?
    -----------------------------------
    
    Fire stick farming can prevent invasive weed species into the area because of its capacity and cost effectiveness. They can outcompete native species, decrease agriculture production, and reduce land and cultural values. Mimosa pigra is an example of invasive weed species that has been threatening biodiversity in NT.
