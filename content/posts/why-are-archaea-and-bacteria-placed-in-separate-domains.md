Why are archaea and bacteria placed in separate domains?
--------------------------------------------------------

Like bacteria, archaea are prokaryotic organisms and do not have a membrane-bound nucleus. Archaea differ from bacteria in cell wall composition and differ from both bacteria and eukaryotes in membrane composition and rRNA type. These differences are substantial enough to warrant that archaea have a separate domain.

Which of the following is the most important reason that archaea and bacteria belong to separate biological domains?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following is the MOST important reason that Archaea and bacteria belong to separate biological domains? Archaea have a very different sensitivity to antibiotics than bacteria and most are more resistant. Archaea transfer genes similar to a eukaryote, and they have a different genetic history than bacteria.

Why is it important to study bacteria and archaea?
--------------------------------------------------

Bacteria and archaea, along with microbial eukaryotes, are also critical for recycling the nutrients essential for creating new biomolecules. They also drive the evolution of new ecosystems (natural or man-made).

What are two major differences between bacteria and archaea?
------------------------------------------------------------

Responses will vary. A possible answer is: Bacteria contain peptidoglycan in the cell wall; archaea do not. The cell membrane in bacteria is a lipid bilayer; in archaea, it can be a lipid bilayer or a monolayer. Bacteria contain fatty acids on the cell membrane, whereas archaea contain phytanyl.

Why are prokaryotes split into two domains?
-------------------------------------------

Prokaryotes are divided into two groups, Eubacteria (bacteria) and Archaebacteria (archaea), because of some basic differences. -They do not have the same material in their cellular walls (bacteria having peptidoglycan and archaea lacking it).

What are 3 differences between bacteria and archaea?
----------------------------------------------------

Differences between bacteria and archaea include the presence of peptidoglycan in bacteria’s cell walls, differing numbers of ribosomal RNA polymerases, archaea’s adaptability to extreme conditions, and bacteria’s aversion to antibiotics.

What is the purpose of archaea?
-------------------------------

Archaea can also generate energy differently and have unique ecological roles to play, such as being responsible for producing biological methane—something no eukaryotes or bacteria can do.

What is older archaea or bacteria?
----------------------------------

These names have stuck, though a battle continues over whether another word — prokaryotes, meaning Bacteria plus Archaea together — has any legitimate use. And it is no longer believed that Archaea are any older than Bacteria, as their name and the New York Times headline might imply.

What are the similarities and differences between Bacteria and Archaea?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Similar to bacteria, archaea do not have interior membranes but both have a cell wall and use flagella to swim. Archaea differ in the fact that their cell wall does not contain peptidoglycan and cell membrane uses ether linked lipids as opposed to ester linked lipids in bacteria.

What are differences between Bacteria and Archaea?
--------------------------------------------------

A possible answer is: Bacteria contain peptidoglycan in the cell wall; archaea do not. The cell membrane in bacteria is a lipid bilayer; in archaea, it can be a lipid bilayer or a monolayer. Bacteria contain fatty acids on the cell membrane, whereas archaea contain phytanyl.

Why are bacteria and archaea in different domains?
--------------------------------------------------

I understand that bacteria and archaebacteria have enough of a genetic difference to be separate kingdoms, but why are they separate domains? The reason that Archaea were determined to be a separate (and only the third) kingdom so late ( 1977 according to this reference) was because archaea often completely resemble eubacteria.

Where was the first place archaea were discovered?
--------------------------------------------------

Although many books and articles still refer to them as “Archaebacteria”, that term has been abandoned because they aren’t bacteria — they’re Archaea. Finding Archaea : The hot springs of Yellowstone National Park, USA, were among the first places Archaea were discovered.

When did Carl Woese discover the domain Archaea?
------------------------------------------------

Domain Archaea/Archaebacteria: In the 1970s, while studying the relationships among prokaryotes using DNA sequences, a scientist named Carl Woese discovered some “ unusual ” organisms that appear to be very distinct from prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

How are enzymes from archaea used in everyday life?
---------------------------------------------------

Some enzymes from Archaea are also used to convert cornstarch into the fiber dextrin. Some Archaea also bear the potential for bioremediation or help in cleaning contaminated sites.
