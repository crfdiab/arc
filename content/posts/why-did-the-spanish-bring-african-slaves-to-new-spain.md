Why did the Spanish bring African slaves to New Spain?
------------------------------------------------------

To meet the mounting demand for labor in mining and agriculture, the Spanish began to exploit a new labor force: slaves from western Africa. Slavery was a familiar institution to many sixteenth-century Europeans.

How many African slaves were brought to New Spain?
--------------------------------------------------

When we examine a delimited period in the sixteenth century, between 1521 and 1594, the data indicates that approximately 36,500 Africans had been brought to New Spain.

When did slavery end in New Spain?

1811 â€“ Spain abolishes slavery, including in its colonies, though Cuba rejects ban and continues to deal in slaves.

How many slaves were brought to Spanish America?
------------------------------------------------

We now believe that as many as 1,506,000 enslaved Africans arrived in the Spanish Americas directly from Africa between 1520 and 1867. We further estimate that an additional 566,000 enslaved Africans were disembarked in Spanish America from other European colonies in the New World, such as Jamaica and Brazil.

How did slaves get to the Spanish colonies?
-------------------------------------------

British slave traders would supply slaves from Africa to the Spanish colonies in South America, via the island of Jamaica. Many Bristol merchants traded with Jamaica. This meant that many enslaved Africans were shipped to Jamaica in Bristol-owned ships, and later sold on to the Spanish colonies in South.

When did slavery start in the New Spain?

At the beginning of the sixteenth century, in New Spain a large number of indigenous people lived in conditions of slavery. By 1517 King Charles V of Spain had granted permission to his colonies for the purchase of slaves, and with this the commercial exchange of Africans began.

Why did the Africans come to New Spain?
---------------------------------------

Thus, the African population arrived in New Spain as slaves to be employed in the heaviest jobs.

How did Spain gain control of the Americas?
-------------------------------------------

Just as Castilian concessions in 1479 helped put Isabel on the throne of Castile, similar recognition of Portuguese claims in Africa in 1494 helped to secure Spanish interests in the Americas. As a result, it was Spain, rather than Portugal, that first made extensive use of enslaved Africans as a colonial labor force in the Americas.
