When was the first rocket launched into space?
----------------------------------------------

What was the first man-made object to reach another world? When was the first rocket launched into space? The first rocket which could fly high enough to get into space was the V2 missile which was first launched by Germany in 1942. The first rocket which actually launched something into space was used to launch Sputnik, the first satellite.

What was the first partially reusable orbital spacecraft?
---------------------------------------------------------

The first partially reusable orbital spacecraft, a winged non-capsule, the Space Shuttle, was launched by the USA on the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin ‘s flight, on April 12, 1981. During the Shuttle era, six orbiters were built, all of which have flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space.

Who was the first country to launch a satellite into space?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Sputnik, more officially known as Sputnik 1, was the first artificial satellite to safely make it into Earth orbit. The Soviet Union launched it in secret on Oct. 4, 1957, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the same location where Russia launches crews to the International Space Station nowadays.

What kind of rocket was used to launch Sputnik?
-----------------------------------------------

The first rocket which actually launched something into space was used to launch Sputnik, the first satellite, on October 4, 1957. The rocket that launched Sputnik was a R-7 ICBM rocket. Continue the conversation on

Which is the first country to send a man into space?
----------------------------------------------------

China has succeeded in sending its first manned spacecraft into orbit, making it only the third country ever to send a human into space. A Long March 2F rocket known as the Shenzhou V blasted off from the Gobi desert launch pad at 0900 (0100 GMT), and was orbiting Earth 10 minutes later.

When was the first artificial satellite launched into space?

Replica of Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, launched by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957.

Who was the first person to go into space?
------------------------------------------

On that day in 1961, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin (left, on the way to the launch pad) became the first human in space, making a 108-minute orbital flight in his Vostok 1 spacecraft. Newspapers like The Huntsville Times (right) trumpeted Gagarin’s accomplishment.

Who was the first person to go to space?
----------------------------------------

A V-2 A4 rocket launched from Peenemünde, an island off Germany’s Baltic coast, became the first known man-made object to reach space, traveling 118 miles on October 3, 1942. The 2-ton, liquid-propellant rocket was designed by rocket scientist Wernher von Braun and proved extraordinarily deadly during World War II.

Which is the most powerful rocket in the world?
-----------------------------------------------

NASA is currently working on the Space Launch System (SLS), which will be the most powerful rocket the agency has ever built. The launch vehicle is designed for deep space missions and will provide the power to help the Orion spacecraft reach a speed of at least 24,500 mph needed to break out of low-Earth orbit and travel to the Moon.

The story begins on October 3, 1942, almost exactly 15 years before the momentous launch of Sputnik 1. On that day Germany’s secret V-2 rocket (then designated the A-4) achieved its first successful vertical test flight from Peenemünde, off the Baltic coast, climbing to a record altitude of 84.5 kilometers,…
