What is called terminal bud?
----------------------------

The terminal bud is the end of the embryonic shoot, still undeveloped. The apex is the tip of the shoot where you find the terminal bud. Plants with terminal buds will concentrate their resources on that bud to make it grow and allow the plant to get taller.

What is a terminal bud used for?
--------------------------------

A terminal bud grows at the tip of a shoot and causes the shoot to grow longer. These buds produce hormones that move downward along the shoot, inhibiting the growth of other buds on that shoot.

What is a terminal bud on a tree?
---------------------------------

The apical meristem, along with the tiny developing leaves around it, is referred to as the terminal bud. The terminal bud is found at the end of each branch. In most young trees, normally one of the terminal buds grows straight up, and this is called the leader.

What is auxiliary and terminal bud?
-----------------------------------

These buds are capable to form shoots, it can form vegetative shoots (stems and branches) or reproductive shoots (flowers). The terminal bud is also known as apical bud which is the primary growing point situated at the tip of the stem which forms the dominant bud.

Where is the apical bud?
------------------------

(botany) The bud located at the top of the plant. Buds may be classified and described according to their different positions in a plant: terminal bud.

What does bud scales mean?
--------------------------

n. (Botany) one of the hard protective sometimes hairy or resinous specialized leaves surrounding the buds of certain plants, such as the rhododendron.

What is the main function of an apical bud?
-------------------------------------------

Typically, the end of a shoot contains an apical bud, which is the location where shoot growth occurs. The apical bud produces a plant hormone, auxin, (IAA) that inhibits growth of the lateral buds further down on the stem towards the axillary bud.

How do I identify a tree by its bud?
------------------------------------

Buds can be helpful in identifying tree species in winter, when deciduous trees are without foliage. Those at the end of a twig are called terminal buds, while those growing along the twig are lateral buds. The arrangement of these lateral buds can help establish a treeâ€™s identity.

What is the difference between apical bud and terminal bud?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Apical buds occur at the end, or apex, of stems. Because of this location, they are also known as terminal buds. Axillary buds occur at a leaf node, which is where a leaf emerges from the stem of a stem.

What is the first apical bud of shoot?
--------------------------------------

An axillary bud, the precursor of a branch or lateral shoot, is formed at the junction between a leaf and the stem. The shoot apex tends to inhibit outgrowth of axillary buds, a phenomenon called apical dominance.

What is a terminal bud scale scar?
----------------------------------

nodes are the positions on the stem where leaves and buds arise. bud scales are scale-like modified leaves that protect the lateral and terminal buds (better view on next photo). bud scale scars are the scars remaining after the bud scales fall off. a leaf scar is the scar remaining after the leaf falls off.

What happens if a terminal bud is removed?
------------------------------------------

If a terminal bud is removed, the growth of lateral buds is stimulated and the plant becomes bushier. But if lateral buds or branches are removed, growth is channeled into the terminal bud and the plant becomes taller or longer.

Where do terminal buds and axillary buds occur?
-----------------------------------------------

Also known as apical buds, terminal buds are able to hinder the growth of other buds known as axillary buds. Apical buds occur at the end, or apex, of stems. Because of this location, they are also known as terminal buds. Axillary buds occur at a leaf node, which is where a leaf emerges from the stem of a stem.

What are the buds at the end of the stem?
-----------------------------------------

Also known as apical buds, terminal buds are able to hinder the growth of other buds known as axillary buds. Apical buds occur at the end, or apex, of stems. Because of this location, they are also known as terminal buds.

What are the differences between Terminal and apical buds?
----------------------------------------------------------

What Are the Differences Between Terminal &amp; Apical Buds? On plants, new growth primarily occurs at terminal buds. Also known as apical buds, terminal buds are able to hinder the growth of other buds known as axillary buds.

Where are the buds located on a plant?
--------------------------------------

Location of Buds. Apical buds occur at the end, or apex, of stems. Because of this location, they are also known as terminal buds.
