Why does freezing rain happen?
------------------------------

Freezing rain occurs when the layer of freezing air is so thin that the raindrops do not have enough time to freeze before reaching the ground. Instead, the water freezes on contact with the surface, creating a coating of ice on whatever the raindrops contact.

What conditions are necessary for freezing rain?
------------------------------------------------

Freezing rain is simply rain that falls through a shallow layer of cold temperatures at or below 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees F) near the surface. When this rain becomes supercooled, it can freeze on contact with roads, bridges, trees, power lines, and vehicles.

Is it safe to drive when its below freezing?
--------------------------------------------

Whether the roadway has been treated or not, black ice can form (or reform) extremely quickly. When driving at or below freezing temperatures, be extremely cautious on bridges and overpasses, especially if they appear to be wet. The wet looking surface may actually be ice.

What happens if you don’t warm up your car before driving?
----------------------------------------------------------

What Will Happen if You Don’t Warm Up Your Carbureted Car Before Driving? The more you drive with your engine cold the faster the cylinder and piston will wear out. Simply leaving the engine to idle doesn’t warm it up efficiently, so the car’s application will remain cold until you start driving.

How do you drive safe in freezing rain?
---------------------------------------

Safety tips for driving in freezing rain:

1. Stay home if you can!
2. Take your time.
3. Leave space.
4. Give yourself extra time.
5. Use your windshield wipers and fluid.
6. Equip your car with winter tires.
7. Keep a safety kit handy.

What makes the water freeze up in freezing rain?
------------------------------------------------

Freezing rain occurs when the conditions are just “right.” Falling snow encounters, first a layer of warmer air, which melts the snowflakes, and then, just above the surface of Earth, a very cold layer, which makes the liquid water “super-cooled,” ready to freeze up at the slightest hint of encouragement.

Which is worse freezing rain or falling snow?
---------------------------------------------

However, freezing rain can be even worse. Freezing rain occurs when the conditions are just “right.” Falling snow encounters, first a layer of warmer air, which melts the snowflakes, and then, just above the surface of Earth, a very cold layer, which makes the liquid water “super-cooled,” ready to freeze up at the slightest hint of encouragement.

What causes freezing rain in the Gulf of Mexico?
------------------------------------------------

The warm air from the Gulf of Mexico is often the fuel for freezing precipitation. Freezing rain develops when falling snow encounters a layer of warm air aloft, typically around the 800 mbar (800 hPa) level, causing the snow to melt and become rain.

Where does freezing rain occur in the world?
--------------------------------------------

Freezing rain can also occur in valleys where cold air can get dammed or stuck. Because cold air sinks below warm air, it sometimes can get stuck in pools or forced into lower elevations by wind, such as cold air damming situations that occur a few times each winter in the Southeast east of the Appalachians.
