What are 3 ways that desert plants are adapted to the desert environment?

How plants adapt to arid conditions

- thick, waxy skin to reduce loss of water and to reflect heat.

- spikes protect cacti from animals wishing to use stored water.
- deep roots to tap groundwater.

They trap moisture near the plant. Deciduous plants lose their leaves for part of the year, this is convenient for desert plants because that means less water loss.
