What was the name of the all water route to the Pacific Ocean the expedition was tasked with finding?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section Summary. In 1803, Thomas Jefferson appointed Meriwether Lewis to organize an expedition into the Louisiana Territory to explore and map the area but also to find an all-water route from the Missouri River to the Pacific Coast.

What is the name of the all water route across the continent?
-------------------------------------------------------------

For hundreds of years, explorers had searched for a way to cross the continent by a water route, sometimes know as the Northwest Passage or the Passage to India. Jefferson and most other geographers of the time were not aware of the size and extent of the Rocky Mountains.

Who was the first person to cross the Pacific Ocean?
----------------------------------------------------

Alexander Mackenzie had already charted a route in his quest for the Pacific, following Canada’s Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean in 1789. Mackenzie and his party were the first to cross America north of Mexico, reaching the Pacific coast in British Columbia in 1793–a dozen years before Lewis and Clark.

Where was the route of the Northwest Passage?
---------------------------------------------

Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. The quest for the passage was one of the world’s severest maritime challenges. The route is located 500 miles (800 km) north of the Arctic Circle and less than 1,200 miles (1,930 km) from the North Pole.

How is the Pacific Ocean connected to the Indian Ocean?
-------------------------------------------------------

Geography. The Indonesian Seaway (including the Strait of Malacca and Torres Strait) joins the Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the west, and Drake Passage and the Strait of Magellan link the Pacific with the Atlantic Ocean on the east. To the north, the Bering Strait connects the Pacific with the Arctic Ocean.

Where does the South Pacific Ocean meet the North Pacific Ocean?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Ocean circulation (caused by the Coriolis effect) subdivides it into two largely independent volumes of water, which meet at the equator: the North (ern) Pacific Ocean and South (ern) Pacific Ocean. The Galápagos and Gilbert Islands, while straddling the equator, are deemed wholly within the South Pacific.
