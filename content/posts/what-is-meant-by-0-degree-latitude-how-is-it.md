What is meant by 0 degree latitude How is it?
---------------------------------------------

Zero degrees latitude is the line designating the Equator and divides the Earth into two equal hemispheres (north and south). The Equator is the line of zero degrees latitude around the middle of Earth.

What is the zero degrees latitude starting point?
-------------------------------------------------

The equator  
The equator is the starting point for measuring latitude–that’s why it’s marked as 0 degrees latitude. The number of latitude degrees will be larger the further away from the equator the place is located, all the way up to 90 degrees latitude at the poles.

Where is 0 degrees latitude and 0 degrees longitude?
----------------------------------------------------

What Is at 0 Degrees Latitude What Is at 0 Degrees Latitude and 0 Degrees Longitude? The intersection point of the prime meridian (0 degrees longitude) and the equator (0 degrees latitude) is in the Atlantic Ocean in the Gulf of Guinea, almost 400 miles south of the Republic of Ghana on the west coast of Africa.

Is there an island at zero latitude and zero longitude?
-------------------------------------------------------

There is a fictional island known as null island at zero latitude and zero longitude that can be found in the public domain Natural Earth GIS data. This one square meter area island is used for troubleshooting purposes for flagging geocoding failures. The map below shows in dashed red the lines of zero degrees latitude and zero degrees longitude.

Why are there zero degrees on the equator?
------------------------------------------

Zero degrees latitude is the line designating the Equator and divides the Earth into two equal hemispheres (north and south). Zero degrees longitude is an imaginary line known as the Prime Meridian. Therefore, we are looking for what exists at the location where the Equator and the Prime Meridian cross each other.

Are there 90 degrees latitude from the equator to the North Pole?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

There are 90 degrees latitude from the equator (zero degrees latitude) to the North Pole. What are the names of the lines at zero degrees latitude and zero degrees longitude? Zero degrees latitude is the “Equator” and zero degrees Longitude is the “Prime Meridian”. What is zero degrees latitude is called the?
