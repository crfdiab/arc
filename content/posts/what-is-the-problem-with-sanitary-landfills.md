What is the problem with sanitary landfills?
--------------------------------------------

The largest issue associated with sanitary landfills is the risk of pollution. As waste breaks down, methane gas is created, and if it escapes from the landfill, it could pollute the air. In addition, methane gas can be dangerous if it builds up in the landfill because it is flammable and could be explosive.

How do landfills effect the environment?
----------------------------------------

Landfilling has many effects on water resources. Almost 2/3rd of landfill waste is biodegradable. This waste rots and decomposes, and produces harmful gases (CO2 and Methane) which are both greenhouse gases and contribute to global warming. Landfills also pollute the local environment, including the water and the soil.

What are the environmental and socio impacts of a sanitary landfill?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The degradation of wastes in the landfill results in the production of leachate and gases. Socio-economic impacts of landfills include risks for public health derived from surfaceor groundwater contamination by leachate, the diffusion of litter into the wider environment and inadequate on-site recycling activities.

What are 2 major problems associated with sanitary landfills?
-------------------------------------------------------------

There are many negative issues associated with landfill. The three most important problems with landfill are toxins, leachate and greenhouse gases.

What are 3 environmental impacts of sending waste to a landfill?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The three main problems with landfill are toxins, leachate and greenhouse gases. Organic waste produces bacteria which break the rubbish down. The decaying rubbish produces weak acidic chemicals which combine with liquids in the waste to form leachate and landfill gas.

Are landfills good for the economy?
-----------------------------------

In many communities where landfills are based they are the largest tax payers, contributing significantly to local revenue and development. Many landfill owners also implement programs that support their local communities. Landfills also provide a economic benefits in terms of taxes paid, host community fees and jobs.

Why are sanitary landfills important to the environment?
--------------------------------------------------------

Sanitary landfills are considered as the most common E-waste disposal technique which aims to reduce or mitigate the potential risks associated with the environment and human health. Landfills are typically positioned in areas where prevailing land features can perform as natural buffers between the environment and landfills.

How are landfills a threat to the environment?
----------------------------------------------

Landfills are designed both to store and to treat wastes. Much of the potential risk from MSW landfill results from the migration of contaminated leachate and landfill gas therefore the environmental impacts of the many landfills existing throughout the world cannot be ignored.

What are the environmental impacts of MSW landfills?
----------------------------------------------------

It is well known that the impact of MSW landfills can cause pollution of all environmental components. The negative environmental impact of landfills can be reduced by applying protec- tion technologies and appropriate solid waste management technologies.

How does methane from landfills affect the environment?
-------------------------------------------------------

In the U.K., much of that methane from landfill sites produce electricity, with carbon dioxide as a by-product, which has a weaker global warming effect. Oftentimes the air surrounding landfill sites smells unpleasant, due to the decaying organic waste.
