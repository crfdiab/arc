How do they name hurricanes and storms?
---------------------------------------

For that reason, the World Meteorological Organization develops a list of names that are assigned in alphabetical order to tropical storms as they are discovered in each hurricane season. Names can be repeated after an interval of six years, but the names of especially severe storms are permanently retired from use.

Are hurricanes named in alphabetical order?
-------------------------------------------

The storms were named in alphabetical order. If one hurricane season runs through all the assigned names for that year, the National Hurricane Center uses the Greek alphabet to name the additional hurricanes. We then have Hurricane Alpha, Hurricane Beta, Hurricane Gamma, etc.

What is the naming system of a hurricane called?
------------------------------------------------

NOAA’s National Hurricane Center does not control the naming of tropical storms. Instead, there is a strict procedure established by the World Meteorological Organization. For Atlantic hurricanes, there is a list of male and female names which are used on a six-year rotation.

How are hurricanes classified according to their category?
----------------------------------------------------------

Hurricanes are classified into five categories based on their wind speed, central pressure, and damage potential (see chart). Category Three and higher hurricanes are considered major hurricanes, though Categories One and Two are still extremely dangerous and warrant your full attention. Check Out The Hurricane Maps.

What kind of naming system does a hurricane use?
------------------------------------------------

Hurricanes are named using a naming system created by the World Meteorological Organization Tropical Cyclone Programme. Hurricane names from the Atlantic 2013 hurricane season list.

When do tropical storms get a specific name?
--------------------------------------------

Every year, tropical storms tracked by the National Hurricane Center are given a specific name when they reach the speed of 39 mph. (They retain that name if, or when, their speed is tracking to hurricane levels.) Here’s what you need to know about that process, and why it’s important. Why do we name hurricanes?
