How do dolphins change the environment?
---------------------------------------

Dolphins play an important role in keeping their environment in balance. They eat other animals – mainly fish and squid – and are themselves a source of food for some sharks and other creatures. Without dolphins, the animals they prey on would increase in number, and their predators wouldn’t have as much to eat.

How dolphins are affected by climate change?
--------------------------------------------

According to new research, the impacts of climate change on dolphins and marine life are more severe than scientists previously thought. After collecting data for 10 years, researchers found that dolphins’ survival rates decreased by 12 percent after the heat wave of 2011 and female dolphins gave birth less often.

How does a dolphin grow and change?
-----------------------------------

Within a few minutes of its birth, the calf can swim and breathe independently and begins to follow its mother closely. Baby dolphins are called calves and may appear paler in color than adult dolphins. It takes between five and ten years for a calf to reach puberty and mate among most dolphin species.

Are dolphins dangerous?
-----------------------

Dolphins are large and powerful marine predators and interacting with them poses serious health and safety concerns for both people and animals. Dolphins at swim-with attractions have been known to seriously hurt humans by butting them and the resulting injuries have included lacerations and broken bones.

How are dolphins a part of the ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------

Dolphins and the ecosystem. Dolphins are apex or top level predators. They are the natural control mechanism for the number of fish and squid and help to maintain the balance in the ecosystem. This balance is fine tuned and delicate.

Why are the Dolphins making a move south?
-----------------------------------------

It is still unclear whether the move south is simply for warmth, or whether it is due to other factors, such as increased numbers of prey. The amount of salt in the water also affected whether dolphins hung around – the dolphins were at their lowest abundance when salinity was high.

How are toxins in the water affect Dolphins?
--------------------------------------------

When toxins in the water affect dinoflagellate plankton, they produce the brevotoxin when they bloom, which is lethal to dolphins if ingested, according to the International Dolphin Watch Website. Dolphins are mammals that breathe oxygen.

When do dolphins migrate to the warmer waters?
----------------------------------------------

Just like a human fingerprint, these features allow identification of individual dolphins, so each dolphin could be tracked throughout their migrations. The researchers found that dolphins tended to begin migration when water temperatures dropped, moving south to warmer waters.
