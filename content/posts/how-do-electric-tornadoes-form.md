How do electric tornadoes form?
-------------------------------

He shows: the high electric voltage between clouds and ground surface produces the intensive electron/ion flow into tornado. That flow creates the air stream which sucks off (pumping) air from the inside tornado channel and make the tornado stability.

Can tornadoes be artificially created?
--------------------------------------

Tornadoes can be artificially created using either steam or dry ice so there’s at least something to see, a fan and a cylinder of some type. You can also use an enclosed canister with soapy water inside and shake it to create a vortex.

What is a tornado powered by?
-----------------------------

Tornadoes form when warm, humid air collides with cold, dry air. The denser cold air is pushed over the warm air, usually producing thunderstorms. The warm air rises through the colder air, causing an updraft. The updraft will begin to rotate if winds vary sharply in speed or direction.

Can a man made tornado produce green energy?
--------------------------------------------

Man-made tornadoes may produce green energy (PHOTOS) Massive man-made twisters reaching to the skies from cyclopean structures on the ground may be the future of suburban landscape. A Canadian firm is developing the technology to use the tornadoes to produce electricity – and assures it would be safe.

What makes a tornado in the Gulf of Mexico?
-------------------------------------------

The first ingredient needed to make a tornado, he explains, is energy in the form of warm, moist, unstable air. In Oklahoma, that comes on southerly winds off the Gulf of Mexico. The second ingredient is wind shear —a measure of how much the wind changes speed and direction between the ground and higher levels of the atmosphere.

What happens to the particles in a tornado?
-------------------------------------------

As tornadoes form, particles become charged in the swirling mass of air. The resulting low-frequency electromagnetic waves might form the basis of an early warning system In this image taken by the tornado hunters the rotation area and some general storm structure can be seen, as well as a dramatic indication of its electrical power

What are the two main parts of a tornado?
-----------------------------------------

Tornadoes require two main parts. The first being energy, which comes as warm, moist, unstable air from the Gulf of Mexico. The second is wind shear—a measure of how much the wind changes speed and direction between the ground and higher levels of the atmosphere.
