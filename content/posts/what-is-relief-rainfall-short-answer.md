What is relief rainfall short answer?
-------------------------------------

Relief rainfall, also known as orographic rainfall, occurs in areas where land increases in height. Relief rainfall is formed when the air cools as it rises over relief features in the landscape such as hills or mountains. As the air rises, it cools, condenses and forms rain.

What is the difference between relief and frontal rainfall?
-----------------------------------------------------------

1- Relief Rainfall is known as Orographic Rainfall. Frontal Rainfall occurs when a warm air mass and other air masses meet.

What is relief organic rainfall?
--------------------------------

Orographic precipitation, rain, snow, or other precipitation produced when moist air is lifted as it moves over a mountain range. As the air rises and cools, orographic clouds form and serve as the source of the precipitation, most of which falls upwind of the mountain ridge.

What is relief and frontal rainfall?
------------------------------------

Relief rainfall Air is forced to rise over high areas. Air cools and condenses. Clouds form and it rains. Air descends on the other side of the mountains.

What is rain also called?
-------------------------

In meteorology, precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravitational pull from clouds. The main forms of precipitation include drizzling, rain, sleet, snow, ice pellets, graupel and hail.

Why is it called relief rainfall?
---------------------------------

leeward (sheltered) 2 Relief rainfall Wind is just moving air. When the wind meets a line of high hills or mountains, there’s only one way to go – up! So the air rises and cools, and we get rain. We call it relief rainfall.

What are three types of rainfall weather?
-----------------------------------------

The three types of rainfall include relief, convectional, and frontal rainfall.

What is frontal rain caused by?
-------------------------------

Frontal precipitation is the result of frontal systems surrounding extratropical cyclones or lows, which form when warm and tropical air meets cooler air. Frontal precipitation typically falls out of nimbostratus clouds.

Who is the wife of rain?

How is rainfall caused?
-----------------------

What causes rain? Clouds are made of water droplets. Within a cloud, water droplets condense onto one another, causing the droplets to grow. When these water droplets get too heavy to stay suspended in the cloud, they fall to Earth as rain.

What kind of rain is a relief rainfall?
---------------------------------------

Relief rainfall, also known as orographic rainfall, is a type of rain caused by warm, moist air that is forced to rise as it passes over higher elevations.

How is relief rain formed in the sky?
-------------------------------------

Relief rain is formed from moised air that rises from the sea and rises over highland such as mountains and hills, and starts to cool and condensates (forms clouds), which then forms heavy rain. What is the meaning for rainfall? The meanin Relief rainfall is rain that affects the weather

When does orographic rain form in the landscape?
------------------------------------------------

Relief or orographic rain is formed when air is forced to cool when it rises over relief features in the landscape such as hills or mountains.

What causes relief rainfall on the lee slope?
---------------------------------------------

Relief rainfall is when warm, moist air, typically from a body of water, is pushed up a slope or mountain. The air is cooled as it rises, and loses its moisture as rain or snow. This usually produces drier conditions on the lee slope (downwind).
