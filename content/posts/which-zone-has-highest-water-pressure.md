Which zone has highest water pressure?
--------------------------------------

Temperatures in the Mesopelagic zone range from 5 to 4 °C (41 to 39 °F). The pressure is higher here, it can be up to 1,470 pounds per square inch (10,100,000 Pa) and increases with depth. 54% of the ocean lies in the Bathypelagic (aphotic) zone into which no light penetrates.

What is the deepest part of the aphotic zone?
---------------------------------------------

The zone starts at 2,000 m deep into the ocean and extends down to the ocean floor. This spans about 2,000 m, since the ocean is 4,000 m on average. The aphotic zone is also known as the “midnight zone”.

What happens in aphotic zone of a body of water?
------------------------------------------------

The aphotic zone (aphotic from Greek prefix ἀ- + φῶς “without light”) is the portion of a lake or ocean where there is little or no sunlight. Most food in this zone comes from dead organisms sinking to the bottom of the lake or ocean from overlying waters.

What is the water pressure in the sunlight zone?
------------------------------------------------

5,850 pounds per square inch  
This zone extends from 1,000 meters (3,281 feet) down to 4,000 meters (13,124 feet). Here the only visible light is that produced by the creatures themselves. The water pressure at this depth is immense, reaching 5,850 pounds per square inch.

How much of the ocean is in the midnight zone?
----------------------------------------------

Ninety percent  
Midnight Zone: Ninety percent of the ocean is in the midnight zone. It is entirely dark—there is no light. The water pressure is extreme. The temperature is near freezing.

What fish live in midnight zone?
--------------------------------

Let’s learn about the Midnight Zone of the Ocean! The midnight zone is home to many different animals including the: Anglerfish, Octopuses, Vampire Squids, Eels, and Jellyfish. It is the third layer down from the top of the ocean.

Where is an aphotic zone?
-------------------------

The bottommost, or aphotic, zone is the region of perpetual darkness that lies beneath the photic zone and includes most of the ocean waters.

What type of fish live in the Twilight Zone?
--------------------------------------------

Animals that live in the twilight zone include: lantern fish, rattalk fish, hatchet fish, viperfish, and mid-water jellyfish. This murky part of the ocean begins at about 600 feet under the water and extends to the darkest part, which begins about 3000 feet down. Some squid and fish can use their bodies to make light.

What are the 5 pelagic zones?
-----------------------------

The pelagic zone is divided into epipelagic, mesopelagic, bathypelagic, abyssopelagic, and hadopelagic zones.

How big is the aphotic zone in the ocean?
-----------------------------------------

In clear water, the aphotic zone begins at depths of about xx feet; in murky water, it starts around xx feet. It is usually somewhere between these two extremes. On average, the depth of the ocean is about 13,000 feet (4,000 m). Temperature is nearly freezing and decreases with depth. Pressure is extremely high and increases with depth.

Why are oxygen levels lower in the aphotic zone?
------------------------------------------------

Oxygen levels are definitely lower as compared to the photic zone, but far from what can be considered ‘severe shortage’. This can be attributed to the temperature of the water, with cold water dissolving more oxygen than warm water. 8. Despite the harsh abiotic factors, quite a few species thrive in this part of the ocean.

What is the definition of a pressure zone?
------------------------------------------

Definition and Benefits of Pressure Zones A pressure zone is defined as the area bounded by both a lower and upper elevation, all of which receives water from a given hydraulic grade line (HGL) or pressure from a set water surface.

How much pressure is there in the ocean?
----------------------------------------

Pressure in the ocean increases about one atmosphere for every 10 meters of water depth. So, for example, at a depth of 100 meters, the pressure will be approximately 10 atmospheres or 10 times greater than the pressure at sea level. Travel to 2,000 meters below the ocean’s surface, and the pressure will be approximately 200 atmospheres.
