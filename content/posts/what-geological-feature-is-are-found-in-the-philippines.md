What geological feature is are found in the Philippines?
--------------------------------------------------------

The Philippines may be viewed as a collage of metamorphic terranes, magmatic arcs, ophiolitic complexes, sedimentary basins, and a continental block of Eurasian affinity subjected to tectonic processes.

What is the geology like where metals are found?
------------------------------------------------

Metallic ores occur in every kind of rock and some varieties of soil. The metallic minerals are concentrated into rich masses by igneous, hydrothermal, or erosional/weathering processes. Metals such as chromium, platinum, nickel, copper, and iron can precipitate as sulfide minerals in a cooling body of magma.

Which type of rock is the most common on Earth?
-----------------------------------------------

Sedimentary rocks  
Sedimentary rocks are the most common rocks exposed on Earth’s surface but are only a minor constituent of the entire crust, which is dominated by igneous and metamorphic rocks.

What is the most dominant type of rock in the Philippines?
----------------------------------------------------------

Igneous rocks are commonly found in the Philippines. Sciencelearn.org.nz says, “Igneous rocks are formed from magma in the earth’s mantle.” Typically there are no fossils on the rocks and look glassy.

Where are the gold mines in the Philippines?
--------------------------------------------

Gold and copper deposits in the Philippines tend to be clustered in certain areas such as Luzon Central Cordillera, Camarines Norte, Surigao and Davao, although large deposits may also be found elsewhere, as in Zambales (Dizon mine), Cebu (Atlas mine) and South Cotabato (Tampakan project).

What kind of geology does the Philippines have?
-----------------------------------------------

The Philippines may be viewed as a collage of metamorphic terranes, magmatic arcs, ophiolitic complexes, sedimentary basins and continental block of Eurasian affinity subjected to tectonic processes such as subduction, collision and major strike slip faulting.

What are geologic structures found near the location of?
--------------------------------------------------------

The structures that can be found near the location of metallic deposit are volcanoes and trenches. Gold, copper, iron, chromite, cobalt and other metals are seen near the volcanoes since they are a result of the change in temperature and state of the lava inside the volcanoes that were not released during the eruption.

Where are sedimentary basins located in the Philippines?
--------------------------------------------------------

Sedimentary basins located between arcs include the Ilocos-Central Valley Basin, Cagayan Valley Basin, southeast Luzon Basin, Visayan Sea Basin, Agusan-Davao Basin and Cotabato Basin.
