Is Antarctica twice the size of Australia?
------------------------------------------

Antarctica covers the South Pole and is roughly twice the size of Australia. In the dark of winter the ocean around Antarctica also freezes which doubles its size. Some more facts about Antarctica: Antarctica is the southernmost continent on Earth.

Why does Antarctica look so large?
----------------------------------

The most popular map, the Mercator, does not distort direction/bearing so it was popular for navigating by ship, but it distorts size to an extreme amount at the poles, so places like Greenland and Antarctica look far larger than they really are.

Why does Antarctica look smaller on a globe?
--------------------------------------------

Its because of the projection type used to depict the earth surface. Most the maps we study during our schools are Mercator Projections. They are intended to show the relative position of the continents.

How big is Antarctica with all its ice?
---------------------------------------

Photo: Icebridge (NASA) Antarctica is roughly 5.4 million square miles (14 million square kilometers) in size, and that’s with all of its ice. There is a land mass beneath, which looks like this. Twitter user Icebridgemade this image to illustrate just how large our most unvisited continent actually is.

How big is Antarctica compared to the Southern Ocean?
-----------------------------------------------------

Antarctica is the world’s southernmost continent resting in the Antarctic Circle and surrounded by the Southern Ocean. With 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles) of area, it’s the 5th largest continent.

How big of a population does Antarctica have?
---------------------------------------------

With many governments maintaining permanent manned research facilities here, there is a small but not very stable population between 1,000 and 5,000, depending on the season. This means Antarctica has a population density of just 0.00007 people per square kilometer to 0.0035 people per square kilometer.

How does NASA measure the size of Antarctica?
---------------------------------------------

One tool that NASA uses is ICESat. That stands for the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite. Using ICESat, NASA can measure changes in the size of Antarctica’s ice sheets. ICESat also helps NASA understand how changing polar ice may affect the rest of the planet.
