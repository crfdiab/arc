Why is the natural cycling of materials in the environment important?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Microorganisms help return minerals and nutrients back to the environment so that the materials can then be used by other organisms. As the bacteria and fungi decompose dead matter, they also respire and so release carbon dioxide to the environment, contributing to the carbon cycle .

What are the different cycle of materials in the environment?
-------------------------------------------------------------

2\. Biogeochemical Cycles:-Water, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus all take paths fromthe nonliving environment to living organisms, suchas trees, and then back to the nonliving environment. These paths form cycles, known as biogeochemical cycles.

What are some ways we can respond to environmental issues?
----------------------------------------------------------

Recycle (&amp; then recycle properly) Implementing recycling habits into your daily life is one of the most effective ways to help lessen landfill waste, conserve natural resources, save habitats, reduce pollution, cut down on energy consumption, and slow down global warming.

Why are material cycles important?
----------------------------------

10.1 Material Flows and Cycles. Material flows are an important part of all ecosystems, from the smallest microcosm to the biosphere as a whole. As inputs to production processes, materials enable the development of ecosystem structure and metabolism.

How is flow of materials in ecosystem is cyclic?
------------------------------------------------

Now, according to 10 per cent law, 10% of 200 j, that is, 20 J of energy will be available in deer as flesh food. (iii) The deer will transfer 10% of its 20 J energy to the lion. Thus, the food energy available to the lion will be 10% of 20 J which comes to 2 J.

What makes an ecosystem a self sustaining community?
----------------------------------------------------

An ecosystem is defined as a self-sustaining community of organisms living in a physical environment. Part of what sustains an ecosystem is the constant interchange of matter between its living and physical components. This is the focus of Session 8: Material Cycles in Ecosystems.

Which is an example of a material cycle?
----------------------------------------

This is the focus of Session 8: Material Cycles in Ecosystems. Ecosystems can be vast, like the tropical rainforests that occur along the equator. They can also be very small, like the ecosystem inside the leaves of pitcher plants discussed by Dr. Aaron Ellison in the video.

Why is the flow of energy in an ecosystem unidirectional?
---------------------------------------------------------

This makes the flow of energy in ecosystem ‘unidirectional’. Thus, the flow of energy in the ecosystem is said to be unidirectional because the energy lost as heat from the living organisms of a food chain cannot be reused by plants in photosynthesis.
