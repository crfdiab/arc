The King of Spain gave Magellan five ships and he set off for South America in 1519.

When did Ferdinand Magellan reach Rio de la Plata?
--------------------------------------------------

Ferdinand Magellan reaches South America. There the crew was resupplied, but bad conditions caused them to delay. Afterwards, they continued to sail south along South America’s east coast, looking for the strait that Magellan believed would lead to the Spice Islands. The fleet reached Río de la Plata on January 10, 1520.

----------------------------------------------------

The goal of the expedition was to find a western route to the Moluccas (Spice Islands) and trade for spices.

Magellan believed he had found the Spice Islands and exclaimed, “Montevideo,” that is, “I see a mountain”; but it was only the large delta of the Rio de la Plata.
