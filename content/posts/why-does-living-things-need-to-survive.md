Why does living things need to survive?
---------------------------------------

In order to survive, all living things need air, water, and food. Animals obtain their food from plants and other animals, which provides them with the energy they need to move and grow. An animal’s home (habitat) must provide these basic needs (air, water and food) along with shelter from bad weather and predators.

Do living things need matter to survive?
----------------------------------------

Lesson Summary All living things require a constant input of free energy and matter in order to survive. This energy ultimately comes from the sun as photons, and this sunlight then gets converted into usable energy by plants during photosynthesis. Because they are self-feeders, plants are called autotrophs.

How do non living things affect the environment?
------------------------------------------------

Rocks, Dirt, Sunlight and Water The nonliving things in an ecosystem create and define the ecosystem’s environment and include sunlight, temperature, precipitation, weather, landscape, soil chemistry, water chemistry and even base nutrient supply.

Why living things are important?
--------------------------------

The most fundamental need of living things is water; without this vital resource, life could not exist. Water is needed for many chemical reactions that take place in cells. It also helps transport nutrients and eliminate waste matter. All organisms need nutrients for energy, growth, and repair.

What do all living things need to live?
---------------------------------------

Most living things need food, water, light, temperatures within certain limits, and air. Living things have a variety of characteristics that are displayed to different degrees: they respire, move, respond to stimuli, reproduce and grow, and are dependent on their environment.

How can we protect non-living things?
-------------------------------------

Here are some tips:

1. Make sure you don’t throw toxic, or harmful, materials in the trash, like paint or car batteries.
2. Don’t take super long showers or let water run when you aren’t using it.
3. Don’t drink from plastic water bottles.
4. Don’t have wild animals as pets.
5. Don’t depend on someone else to do this!

How are non living things important to humans?
----------------------------------------------

Some non-living things are so imporint that human can not live without them. Like air and water. Air is one of the most important elcments because air contains the gas oxygen. Oxygen is very important for human because human cannot survive even 5 minutes without oxygen.

Why are living things important to living things?
-------------------------------------------------

Keeping this in consideration, why is living things important? The Earth is definitely the most important thing to our lives. The Earth provides us with the necessities of life; food, water, shelter, oxygen. The Earth did not adapt itself to fit us, we adapted to fit the Earth.

How are non living things related to biota?
-------------------------------------------

The non-living things (physical and chemical processes and materials) compose both independent factors that can control everything (such as sunlight) as well as interactive factors which dynamically interact with biota (such as carbon dioxide, other plant nutrients and for that matter, factors such as humidity and temperature).
