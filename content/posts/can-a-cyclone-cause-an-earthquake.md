Can a cyclone cause an earthquake?
----------------------------------

Summary: Researcher have uncovered a new geophysical phenomenon where a hurricane or other strong storm can spark seismic events in the nearby ocean as strong as a 3.5 magnitude earthquake.

What is a cyclone made of?
--------------------------

A tropical cyclone needs two main ingredients: a cluster of thunderstorms and a warm body of water – at least 27ºC – from which the storm gathers its energy. The warm, tropical ocean under a developing storm evaporates then condenses to form clouds, releasing heat throughout the process.

How can we prevent cyclone?
---------------------------

Effective measures to prevent cyclone disaster

1. A cyclone forecast and warning service.
2. Shifting the people quickly to a safer place.
3. Construction of storm shelters.
4. Afforestation.
5. Construction of cyclone shelters in the cyclone prone areas, and Administrative arrangements for moving people fast to safer places.

How are tropical cyclones formed and what causes them to form?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core. Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases.

Which is worse an earthquake or a cyclone?
------------------------------------------

The cyclone hazard is the most frequent to affect the people of the Pacific and housing damages are almost always a considerable part of the suffering. The earthquake hazard, though much less frequent, can have a devastating impact. On average, around 80% of the deaths caused by earthquakes, are caused by collapsing buildings.

How are the boundaries of an extratropical cyclone determined?
--------------------------------------------------------------

A fictitious synoptic chart of an extratropical cyclone affecting the UK and Ireland. The blue arrows between isobars indicate the direction of the wind, while the “L” symbol denotes the centre of the “low”. Note the occluded, cold and warm frontal boundaries.

Are there any extraterrestrial planets that have cyclones?
----------------------------------------------------------

Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune. Cyclogenesis is the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones.
