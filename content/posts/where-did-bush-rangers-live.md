When did bushrangers stop in Australia?
---------------------------------------

1850s

Why did men turn bushranging?
-----------------------------

Men would have had different reasons for turning to bushranging. Some, like thousands of the convicts transported to NSW, turned to crime out of desperation because of unemployment, or poverty. There were also criminals (like the bushranger Dan Morgan) who were violent offenders and had a history of criminal behaviour.

They generated significant social interest and people often followed their illicit endeavours salaciously illustrated newspapers.
