How does the monsoon season affect China?
-----------------------------------------

The Monsoon Wind, blowing from Africa across the Indian Ocean and over the Himalayas brings water and sediment to Chinaâ€™s coastal Plain. The well-watered, fertile soil has produced enough food to feed a large population for thousands of years.

How does monsoon affect China climate?
--------------------------------------

During summer monsoon period, warm and moist air over tropical oceans is transported to the East Asian region \[1\], forming plenty summer monsoon rainfall. The above-normal rainfall over eastern China is associated with the warm and moist southerlies.

Why is winter monsoon important?
--------------------------------

The winter monsoon brings moist air from the South China Sea to areas like Indonesia and Malaysia. The Asian-Australian monsoon, which includes the Indian Ocean, stretches from northern Australia to Russias Pacific coast. This huge monsoon wind system then stretches into the Indian Ocean.

How does the East Asian Winter Monsoon affect China?
----------------------------------------------------

The warm ENSO induced lower-level southwesterly winds deflect from the southeast coast of China, and thus, the influence of ENSO on winter rainfall is mainly in southern China. The lower-level southerly winds associated with a weak EAWM penetrate northward over eastern China, and thus, the EAWM influences winter rainfall in eastern China.

Why are winter monsoon winds less powerful than summer winds?
-------------------------------------------------------------

These winds start in the air above Mongolia and northwestern China. Winter monsoons are less powerful than summer monsoons in Southeast Asia, in part because the Himalaya Mountains prevent much of the wind and moisture of the monsoons from reaching the coast.

How are people affected by the summer monsoon?
----------------------------------------------

During summer monsoons, heavy rainfall can cause flooding. Powerful floodwaters can drown victims and damage buildings, leaving people without homes and vulnerable to the elements. During the 2014 summer monsoon in Pakistan and India, nearly 300 people lost their lives during landslides and home collapses.

Where does the wind blow in the monsoon?
----------------------------------------

The Monsoon wind blows in opposite directions at different times of the year. As the Northern hemisphere warms in spring and summer the Monsoon wind changes directions and instead of blowing towards Africa it blows from Africa across the Indian Ocean, India and over the Himalayan Mountains into China and across the Tibetan Plateau.
