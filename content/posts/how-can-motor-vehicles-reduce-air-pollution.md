How can motor vehicles reduce air pollution?
--------------------------------------------

Follow these tips to reduce the time you spend driving:

1. Walk or bike when you can.
2. Use the bike-share programs if your city or town has them.
3. Take public transit when possible.
4. Carpool with friends instead of driving alone.
5. Use ride-sharing services.

How can we reduce the air pollution?
------------------------------------

Ways to Reduce Air Pollution

1. Riding a bike or walking instead of driving.
2. Taking a bus or carpooling.
3. Buying a car that has greater fuel efficiency.
4. Turning off lights and appliances when they are not in use.
5. Using energy efficient light bulbs and appliances.
6. Buying fewer things that are manufactured using fossil fuels.

How can we reduce pollution from cars?
--------------------------------------

Everyone can take steps to reduce vehicle pollution

1. Ride a bike or walk. If you are only going a short distance, consider riding a bike or walking instead of driving.
2. Take public transit.
3. Carpool.
4. Avoid idling.
5. Use alternative fuels.

Which energy can be used to control air pollution?
--------------------------------------------------

Power plants reduce air pollution emissions in various ways Burning low-sulfur-content coal to reduce SO2 emissions. Some coal-fired power plants cofire wood chips with coal to reduce SO2 emissions. Pretreating and processing coal can also reduce the level of undesirable compounds in combustion gases.

How do vehicles pollute the air?
--------------------------------

Carbon monoxide- This odorless, colorless gas is formed by the combustion of fossil fuels such as gasoline. Cars and trucks are the source of nearly two-thirds of this pollutant. Hazardous air pollutants- These chemical compounds, which are emitted by cars, trucks, refineries, gas pumps, and related sources.

How can we protect from pollution?
----------------------------------

On Days when High Particle Levels are Expected, Take these Extra Steps to Reduce Pollution:

1. Reduce the number of trips you take in your car.
2. Reduce or eliminate fireplace and wood stove use.
3. Avoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials.
4. Avoid using gas-powered lawn and garden equipment.

Are cars bad for pollution?
---------------------------

Road transport is a major source of air pollution that harms human health and the environment. Vehicles emit a range of pollutants including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM).

How are catalytic converters used to reduce air pollution?
----------------------------------------------------------

Catalytic converters only work when they are hot, so a lot of exhaust escapes as the car is warming up. Catalytic converters are placed on modern cars in the United States. Making a vehicle more fuel efficient. Lighter more streamlined vehicles need less energy. Hybrid vehicles have an electric motor and a rechargeable battery.

How are cars helping to reduce air pollution?
---------------------------------------------

Reducing air pollution from vehicles can be done in a number of ways. Breaking down pollutants before they are released into the atmosphere. Motor vehicles emit less pollution than they once did because of catalytic converters ( Figure below ).

How is the United States reducing air pollution?
------------------------------------------------

Increasing our use of renewable energy and decreasing our use of coal-powered electricity, increasing alternative transportation such as hybrid/electric vehicles and adding catalytic converters to automobiles has reduced acid deposition in the United States. Q. What is a primary pollutant?

Are there any fuel cells that produce no pollution?
---------------------------------------------------

Fuel cells are extremely efficient and they produce no pollutants. But developing fuel-cell technology has had many problems and no one knows when or if they will become practical. A hydrogen fuel-cell car looks like a gasoline-powered car.
