How many parallels of latitude are important on a globe?
--------------------------------------------------------

four important parallels  
Besides the equator (0°), the North Pole (90°N) and the South Pole (90° S), there are four important parallels of latitudes– (i) Tropic of Cancer (23½° N) in the Northern Hemisphere. (ii) Tropic of Capricorn (23½° S) in the Southern Hemisphere. (iii) Arctic Circle at 66½° north of the equator.

What are the important parallel on the globe?
---------------------------------------------

The five major parallels of latitudes from north to south are called: Arctic Circle, Tropic of Cancer, Equator, Tropic of Capricorn, and the Antarctic Circle.

What is the total number of parallels and meridians?
----------------------------------------------------

Explanation: There are 181 parallels and 360 meridians on the Earth.

How many parallels are there in total?
--------------------------------------

Answer: The total number of latitudes is 180 Lines of latitude are known as parallels and there are 180 degrees of latitude in total. There are 360 longitudes.

What is the total number of parallels across the globe?
-------------------------------------------------------

The total number of parallels across the globe is 181. 360 is total number of longitudinal lines, not parallel (Latitude) lines. Explanation: The Earth is divided by the Equator into two equal halves known as the Northern Hemisphere (with 90 parallels) and the Southern Hemisphere (with 90 parallels).

How many parallels are there with the equator?
----------------------------------------------

These 180 parallels along with the Equator make a total of 181 parallels across the globe.

Why are lines of latitude called Parallels on the globe?
--------------------------------------------------------

Parallels are another name for lines of latitude. You will see that these lines do not converge, or come together, anywhere on the globe. We call these parallels because they are always an equal distance apart. The first parallel is the equator. It is latitude 0. Latitude measures distance north and south from the Equator.

Are there any parallels between the north and South Poles?
----------------------------------------------------------

Important Parallels of latitudes The North Pole (90ºN) &amp; the South Pole (90ºS) are important Latitudes, since the location of the Equator is obtained… The Equator (0º) divides the Earth into two hemispheres, the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere, All the… The Tropic of Cancer (23 1 …
