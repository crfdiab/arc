What are the effects of anticyclones?
-------------------------------------

Anticyclones can bring us very cold, crisp bright winter days and warm, sunny summer weather. In winter, the clear, settled conditions and light winds associated with anticyclones can lead to frost and fog.

Why are anticyclones responsible for good weather?
--------------------------------------------------

In summer, anticyclones bring dry, hot weather. In winter, clear skies may bring cold nights and frost. In cold conditions, anticyclones may also bring fog and mist. This is because the cold forces moisture in the air to condense at low altitudes.

Are anticyclones good weather?
------------------------------

Areas of high pressure are called anticyclones, whilst low pressure areas are known as cyclones or depressions. Each brings with it different weather patterns. Anticyclones typically result in stable, fine weather, with clear skies whilst depressions are associated with cloudier, wetter, windier conditions.

What kind of weather does a anticyclone cause?
----------------------------------------------

Effects of surface-based anticyclones include clearing skies as well as cooler, drier air. Fog can also form overnight within a region of higher pressure.

Why do anticyclones occur?
--------------------------

Anticyclones form from air masses cooling more than their surroundings, which causes the air to contract slightly making the air more dense. Since dense air weighs more, the weight of the atmosphere overlying a locatiion increases, causing increased surface air pressure.

What happens to the weather during an anticyclone?
--------------------------------------------------

This means that the winds are gentle. As the air sinks, it warms up, leading to warm and dry weather. Anticyclones are much larger than depressions and produce periods of settled and calm weather lasting many days or weeks.

How are anticyclones different from depressions and depressions?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Anticyclones are much larger than depressions and produce periods of settled and calm weather lasting many days or weeks. Anticyclones often block the path of depressions, either slowing down the bad weather, or forcing it round the outside of the high pressure system. They are then called ‘ Blocking Highs ‘.

What are the effects of an anticyclonic air circulation?
--------------------------------------------------------

The development of an anticyclonic type of air circulation is called anticyclogenesis and, depending on how it is, anticyclones are classified as warm or cold. Anticyclones generate some meteorological effects in the areas where they occur, such as fog, frost, increased pollution, clear skies and even headaches.

How are cyclones and low pressure systems related?
--------------------------------------------------

Within these low-pressure systems, air rises from the surface, leading to cloud formation. As a result, low-pressure systems are associated with cloudy weather, a full-range of precipitation and strong winds. One way that cyclones affect the weather is through their warm fronts. These fronts extend eastward from the cyclones.
