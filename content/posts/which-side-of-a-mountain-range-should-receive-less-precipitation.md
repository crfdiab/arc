Which side of a mountain range should receive less precipitation?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

leeward side  
The opposite side of the mountain is called the leeward side and usually sees much less precipitation. The reason is that air is descending on the leeward side of the mountain, and descending air is warmer and drier, which is the opposite of ascending air.

Why is precipitation more abundant on one side of the mountain?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Why do mountains receive more rainfall? They receive more rainfall than low lying areas because the temperature on top of mountains is lower than the temperature at sea level. Winds carry moist air over the land. When air reaches the mountain, it rises because the mountains are in the way.

How is the leeward side of a mountain different from the windward side?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is true most times — but not always.) In contrast to the windward side of a mountain which is moist, the leeward side typically has a dry, warm climate. This is because by the time air rises up the windward side and reaches the summit, it has already stripped of the majority of its moisture.

Why does precipitation fall on the windward side of a mountain?
---------------------------------------------------------------

This cooling often results in the formation of clouds, and eventually, precipitation which falls on the windward slope and at the summit. Known as orographic lifting, this event is one of three ways precipitation can form (the other two are frontal wedging and convection).

What kind of winds blow down the lee side of mountains?
-------------------------------------------------------

Winds that blow down the lee side of mountains are called “downslope winds.” They not only carry low relative humidity but also rush down at extremely strong speeds and can bring temperatures more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the surrounding air.

How are mountains related to weather and climate?
-------------------------------------------------

The influence of mountains on weather and climate, usually referring to the increase of precipitation on the windward side of mountains, and a drier zone (or rain shadow) on the leeward or downwind side of the mountain. The theory that explains the gradual movement of large geological platforms (or plates) along Earth’s surface.
