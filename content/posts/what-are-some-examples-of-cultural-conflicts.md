    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    Individuals are unable to break free of their own cultural barriers, and adapt to Canadian cultural barriers that are frankly different and built upon social norms. What one would consider normal in his birthplace may be deemed a crime in Canadian society which is why the cultural conflicts continue to create more crime within Canada.
    
    Why are there so many crime issues in Canada?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    Conflict culture, subcultures and differential association theory all underlie the reasons why there is a constant issue with crime in the multicultural metro poles. Individuals are unable to break free of their own cultural barriers, and adapt to Canadian cultural barriers that are frankly different and built upon social norms.
    
    How is Canadian Society a reflection of multiculturalism?
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    However, many Canadians consider the presence of many ethno-cultural groups in society as proof of multiculturalism. Some would count heads or utilize the variety of ethnic presence in a work setting as a measure of multiculturalism. The reality is that a society can be diverse in composition without becoming multicultural.
    
    How does culture conflict relate to multiculturalism?
    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    This concept of culture relating to multiculturalism can relate to culture of conflict theory, the subculture theory and the differential association theory. It is not only within ethnic groups that cultural conflicts exist, but also within subcultural groups that are within a larger context of society.
