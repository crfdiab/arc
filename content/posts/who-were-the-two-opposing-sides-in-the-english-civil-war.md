Who were the two opposing sides in the English Civil War?
---------------------------------------------------------

Introduction. Between 1642 and 1646 England was torn apart by a bloody civil war. On the one hand stood the supporters of King Charles I: the Royalists. On the other stood the supporters of the rights and privileges of Parliament: the Parliamentarians.

What religion was Oliver Cromwell?
----------------------------------

Puritan  
Called a dictator by some — including future British Prime Minister Winston Churchill — Cromwell, a devout Puritan, was particularly intolerant of Catholics and Quakers, though he is also credited by others for helping to lead Great Britain toward a constitutional government.

What caused English Civil War?
------------------------------

The English Civil Wars (1642-1651) stemmed from conflict between Charles I and Parliament over an Irish insurrection. Initially northern and western England, together with much of Ireland, stood for the king, while the southeast (including London), the Royal Navy, and Scotland fought for Parliament.

Where did Catholics fight in the Civil War?
-------------------------------------------

Catholics and non-Catholics living, marching, and fighting together overcame many old prejudices. In October 1866, the American hierarchy held a plenary council in the nation’s first episcopal see, Baltimore, in an effort to demonstrate this unity.

Why did people choose sides in the English Civil War?
-----------------------------------------------------

Not only did the men he sought manage to escape, but public opinion was outraged by his action. London was soon in an uproar, and the King, fearing for his life, was forced to flee. War was now inevitable and over the next few months rival sides began to emerge across the country.

Who was the Catholic general in the Civil War?
----------------------------------------------

In the North, prominent Catholics included General William D. Rosecrans, Generals Hugh and Charles Ewing, and General Philip Sheridan. General Grant referred to Sheridan as a man who had no superior as a general, either living or dead, and perhaps no equal.

Why was there friction in the Church of England during the Civil War?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Friction was particularly apparent between religious conservatives, men and women who were happy with the Church of England as it had been established at the time of the Reformation, and more ‘Godly’ protestants’, those who considered the Church to be ‘but half reformed’ and were determined to rid it of the ‘rags and patches of Rome’.
