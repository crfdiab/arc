How many stomata does a plant have?
-----------------------------------

The evaporation of water from the leaf is called transpiration. The number of stomata on leaf surfaces varies widely among different species of plants. The lower epidermis of the leaf tends to have a higher total than the upper surface. The average number of stomata is about 300 per square mm of leaf surface.

What happens if a plant has less stomata?
-----------------------------------------

Most plants use a pore-like structure called stomata (singular: stoma) on the undersides of leaves to absorb carbon dioxide from the air. If there are fewer stomata, or the stomata are closed more of the day, gas exchange will be limited — transpiration included.

Why do stomata close at night?
------------------------------

Stomata are mouth-like cellular complexes at the epidermis that regulate gas transfer between plants and atmosphere. In leaves, they typically open during the day to favor CO2 diffusion when light is available for photosynthesis, and close at night to limit transpiration and save water.

Which side has more stomata?
----------------------------

Transpiration is the loss of water through stomata, so, more stomata are found on the lower surface to prevent excessive loss of water.

Which plants have the most stomata?
-----------------------------------

In vascular plants the number, size and distribution of stomata varies widely. Dicotyledons usually have more stomata on the lower surface of the leaves than the upper surface. Monocotyledons such as onion, oat and maize may have about the same number of stomata on both leaf surfaces.

Does more stomata mean more transpiration?
------------------------------------------

More stomata will provide more pores for transpiration. A leaf with a bigger surface area will transpire faster than a leaf with a smaller surface area.

Where is the stomata located?
-----------------------------

epidermis  
Stomate, also called stoma, plural stomata or stomas, any of the microscopic openings or pores in the epidermis of leaves and young stems. Stomata are generally more numerous on the underside of leaves.

How big are stomata in real life?
---------------------------------

Stomata also varied widely in size, with mean guard cell length ranging from 19.1 to 71.5 μm.

Why are there fewer stomata in the desert?
------------------------------------------

Although plants get plenty of sun light in the desert for photosynthesis, it’s actually too much. Extra heat and low humidity mean that water will pass out of the plant that much faster. Also, there isn’t as much water in the soil, so the plant cannot reliably replace water that is lost.

Why do some plants have more stomata than others?
-------------------------------------------------

Plants have more stomata only if they can afford to lose that much moisture , fewer stomata if they must conserve water . Are you new to botany? In case you’re a bit green, let’s take a step back. What are stomata, exactly?

How tall are the trees in the rainforest?
-----------------------------------------

Plants structure the rainforest through four different layers. Each rainforest layer contains plants that to some extent share similar characteristics. The emergent layer consists of rainforest trees that reach 200 feet tall. Such trees receive the highest amount of sunlight in the forest.

Why does a CAM plant not open its stomata?
------------------------------------------

Rather than leave the stomata gaping during the day to provide that CO2 , CAM plants suck in CO2 at night and stockpile it until day. At that time, it is released in saturating bursts to the right plant parts when the sun is up, without the stomata having to open in the heat.
