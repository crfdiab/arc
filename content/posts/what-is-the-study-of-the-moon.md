What is the study of the moon?
------------------------------

Selenography  
Selenography is the study of the surface and physical features of the Moon. Historically, the principal concern of selenographists was the mapping and naming of the lunar maria, craters, mountain ranges, and other various features.

Which phase of the moon is most powerful?
-----------------------------------------

The Moon exerts a strong gravitational pull that causes the changing tides in our oceans and seas. This gravitational pull is at its strongest during the New Moon and Full Moon, so here we experience the highest and lowest tides.

Why is it important to study moon phases?
-----------------------------------------

Understanding moon phases and eclipses will help students better understand our solar system, the sun, tides, and much more. They will understand what causes the moon phases, and why the moon appears to be a different shape every night.

What is the favorite phase of the moon?
---------------------------------------

Why? Personally, my favorite phases are when the Moon is a waxing crescent 2-4 days after New Moon. I also prefer observing the Moon in the pre-dawn hours before sunrise. A Waning Gibbous is my least favorite Moon phase.

What is a person who studies the Moon called?
---------------------------------------------

An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of Earth. They observe astronomical objects such as stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies – in either observational (by analyzing the data) or theoretical astronomy.

How to learn the phases of the Moon?
------------------------------------

Keep your arm perfectly straight in front of you and the Moon at eye level. GROOVY NOTE: Pay attention to the shadows created on the Moon which mimic the phases of the moon we see here on Earth. Rotate all the way around until you have completed a full lunar cycle and are facing the Sun again.

Why are scientists interested in studying the Moon?
---------------------------------------------------

There are a couple of really good mysteries there — as well as some really good galactic history. Two questions intriguing planetary scientists today are why the gravity of the moon is uneven and why there is so much hydrogen at the lunar poles.

How does the position of the sun affect the phases of the Moon?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The other side of the Moon is dark. The position of the Moon and the Sun during Each of the Moon’s phases and the Moon as it appears from Earth during each phase. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech On Earth, our view of the illuminated part of the Moon changes each night, depending on where the Moon is in its orbit, or path, around Earth.

How are people going to live on the Moon?
-----------------------------------------

Since the time on the moon and the earth is different, participants would need to undergo some unique training. In the preliminary phase, fuel will be sent to the lunar base from the earth, together with four to five groups of people to establish life there.
