Do storms occur in Antarctica?
------------------------------

The wind began to blow at approximately 1:00AM on December 20. In Antarctica the wind blows most of the time, as there is nothing to slow it down and air is continually shifting from location to location due to density.

How bad is the weather in Antarctica?
-------------------------------------

65°S – 70°S. Cold winters and short cold summers, approx. +2°C to -20°C monthly averages. Temperatures are higher than many non-Antarctic continental areas even in winter, summer temperatures kept low due to ice and snow cover.

Does it ever rain in Antarctica?
--------------------------------

Rain is observed near the coast, but most precipitation over Antarctica is in the form of snow or ice crystals. Windy conditions make it difficult to measure snowfall accurately. The average accumulation of snow over the whole continent is estimated to be equivalent to about 150 mm of water per year.

Has anyone ever tried to live in Antarctica?
--------------------------------------------

No-one lives in Antarctica indefinitely in the way that they do in the rest of the world. It has no commercial industries, no towns or cities, no permanent residents. The only “settlements” with longer term residents (who stay for some months or a year, maybe two) are scientific bases.

What is the season in Antarctica now?
-------------------------------------

Antarctica only has two seasons: summer and winter. Because it’s located in the southern hemisphere, Antarctica’s summer is from October to February.

Is Antarctica melting 2020?
---------------------------

The top left map shows the total melt days for the Antarctic Ice Sheet for the 2020 to 2021 melt year. Since mid-February, melting on the Antarctic continent dropped to almost nil, capping a season that started with a few intense melt events in the Peninsula, the Amery Ice Shelf, and the Filchner Ice Shelf (see map).

How big was the snow storm in Antarctica?
-----------------------------------------

Drifts of snow around our tents were 3 to 4 feet high (0.9-1.2 meters). The wind had scalloped out snow in other places making walking around camp treacherous. Mac-Op’s assured us that we should start to see improvement later that day, so we were hopeful that we would not have to re-build our eroding snow walls. The rule of the day was to dig.

When was the worst polar storm in Antarctica?
---------------------------------------------

In the morning of Christmas Eve, the wind was stronger than at any time during the first storm. Clem commented that this was possibly the worst polar storm he had ever been in. This coming from a man on his second trip to Antarctica, as well as having spent time in Greenland did not comfort me very much.

Why is there no rain or snow in Antarctica?
-------------------------------------------

Antarctica is technically a desert, and a particularly dry one at that. This is because the cold air simply can’t hold much water. There’s no precipitation without humidity, and there’s no humidity without heat. You might be wondering why the continent is covered in snow if it rarely falls.

When does the wind start blowing in Antarctica?
