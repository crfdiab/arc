    What is secondary Victimisation?

    ---------------------------------------------------------

    Who is more likely to have PTSD or psychosis?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    Research studies have indicated that between half to 98% of people with experience of psychosis have had at least one traumatic happening in their life. This includes emotional, physical and sexual abuse. People who have experienced psychosis are much more likely, therefore, to have PTSD than those who have never experienced it.
    
    Which is more common PTSD in teens or adults?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    PTSD in adolescents is more common in the later teen years; while the prevalence of PTSD for teens aged 13–14 is 3.7 percent, that number increases to 7 percent in the 17–18 age group. While the overall past year prevalence of PTSD in adults is estimated at 3.6 percent, the numbers indicate that PTSD is far more common in women than in men.
    
    Why do so many victims of domestic violence get PTSD?
    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    The probability of domestic violence victims developing PTSD may be influenced by the severity and duration of violence, as well as the age the violence is experienced. The perceived level of threat from domestic violence — for example, whether or not someone feels their life is in danger — can also influence the development of PTSD.
