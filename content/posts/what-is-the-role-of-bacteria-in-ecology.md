What is the role of bacteria in ecology?
----------------------------------------

Bacteria play important roles in the global ecosystem. The cycling of nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur is completed by their ceaseless labor. Decomposition is the breakdown of these organisms, and the release of nutrients back into the environment, and is one of the most important roles of the bacteria.

Why do we study bacteria?
-------------------------

Bacteria are used in molecular biology, biochemistry and genetic research, because they can grow quickly and are relatively easy to manipulate. Scientists use bacteria to study how genes and enzymes work. Bacteria are needed to make antibiotics.

Why is it important to study microbial ecology?
-----------------------------------------------

Microbial ecology aims to study how microbes live and interact with their environment. Though this branch of study is relatively new compared to others, it is immensely important to all life on Earth.

What is the ecology of bacteria?
--------------------------------

Bacterial ecology is defined as the interaction between bacteria and with their environment. Bacteria play a vital role in the biosphere and certain key processes, such as, the production and oxidation of methane, soil formation, conversion of rock to soil etc. Related Journals of Bacterial Ecology.

How do we use bacteria?
-----------------------

Bacteria are economically important as these microorganisms are used by humans for many purposes. The beneficial uses of bacteria include the production of traditional foods such as yogurt, cheese, and vinegar. Microbes are also important in agriculture for the compost and fertilizer production.

What are disadvantages of bacteria?
-----------------------------------

Some bacteria cause infections or produce toxic substances that are a threat to life and/or health. Bacteria cause spoiling of food so that it does not keep as long as we may desire. Some bacteria may cause infections of plants, threatening our food supply or ornamental plant.

What are good questions about bacteria?
---------------------------------------

9 questions you were too grossed out to ask about the bacteria living on you

- 1) What is the microbiome?
- 2) Am I wrong to not want trillions of microbes living on my body?
- 3) How did microbes get there in the first place?
- 4) So what are these microbes doing to me?
- 5) Does everyone have the same microbes?

What is the main focus of microbial ecology?
--------------------------------------------

Microbial ecology is the study of the interactions of microorganisms with their environment, each other, and plant and animal species. It includes the study of symbioses, biogeochemical cycles and the interaction of microbes with anthropogenic effects such as pollution and climate change.

What diseases are caused by bacteria?
-------------------------------------

Other serious bacterial diseases include cholera, diphtheria, bacterial meningitis, tetanus, Lyme disease, gonorrhea, and syphilis.

Why is the study of microorganisms so important?
------------------------------------------------

Microbiology is the study of microorganisms including, bacteria, viruses, algae, fungi and protozoa. Microorganisms are most famous for their ability to cause disease, however, microorganisms are also vital to agriculture, industry and ecology. In fact, life on Earth would not survive without microorganisms. Microbiology is an interdisciplinary â€¦

How are bacteria important to the global ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------------

Bacteria play important roles in the global ecosystem. The ecosystem, both on land and in the water, depends heavily upon the activity of bacteria. The cycling of nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur is completed by their ceaseless labor.

Why do community ecologists study infectious diseases and what we can?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Community ecologists study the interactions among different species. Ecosystem ecologists study the role organisms play in the flows of energy and elements like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus through nature. In the past quarter-century there has been a flourishing of activity known as the ecology of infectious diseases.

Do you think studying bacteria is a good thing?
-----------------------------------------------

While everyone can get behind studying bacteria that cause life-threatening diseases like typhoid fever and cholera, I think that it is often harder to convince people of the value of studying ordinary and sometimes obscure bacteria that do not directly affect human health.
