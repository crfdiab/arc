Why does the tornado happen?
----------------------------

A lot of people wonder: “How do tornadoes form?” These severe weather events typically stem from thunderstorms, although they don’t have to. Wind shear is one of the most critical components for the formation of a tornado. Wind shear is the change of direction and speed of the wind with height.

Why do tornadoes form in the US?
--------------------------------

Tornadoes form when conditions for strong convective thunderstorms exist. A cold, dense front colliding with a warm, moist front pushes the warm moist air up into the atmosphere, causing the air to cool, condense, and form massive clouds and highly unstable winds.

How does a tornado make contact with the Earth?
-----------------------------------------------

Tornadoes are destructive columns of air that rotate and have contact between earth’s surface and a cumulonimbus cloud. In unusual cases, tornadoes can make contact with earth’s surface and cumulus clouds. Twisters, or cyclones are other names for what is formally known as a tornado.

Why are there so many tornadoes in Tornado Alley?
-------------------------------------------------

Tropical air, when forced upward, encounters naturally cooler air (hence, snow-topped mountains). Like a hot air balloon, the warm air rises freely. The collision of air masses occurs several thousand feet in the atmosphere, fuelling a river of high velocity wind that generally moves west to east across tornado alley.

Why do some thunderstorms turn into tornadoes and not others?
-------------------------------------------------------------

There’s no clear explanation as to why some thunderstorms turn into tornadoes and others don’t, nor do scientists know why they die. Research meteorologist Harold Brooks notes, “Eventually the air gets too cold and it chokes off the inflow of new air into the storm,” but specifics are sparse.

Why are tornadoes so common in flat land?
-----------------------------------------

So while wide expanses of flat land—think: Kansas—are often blamed for playing a role in regions more susceptible to tornadoes, it’s actually how the air flows above that land—and how many supercell thunderstorms form as a result—that makes all the difference. A Canadian inventor believes his tornado machine could solve the world’s energy crisis.
