What has the greatest species diversity?
----------------------------------------

Amazonia represents the quintessence of biodiversity – the richest ecosystem on earth. Yet a study by Smithsonian scientists, published this week in the journal Science, shows that differences in species composition of tropical forests are greater over distance in Panama than in Amazonia.

Which areas have greater species diversity?
-------------------------------------------

Species diversity is greatest in the tropics, particularly in tropical forests and coral reefs. The Amazon basin in South America has the largest area of tropical forests. The southwestern Pacific has the greatest diver- sity of coral reef species.

Which biome has the highest diversity of species Brainly?
---------------------------------------------------------

Explanation: Tropical rain forest biome has the highest diversity of species.

Which forest has maximum diversity?
-----------------------------------

So, the correct answer is ‘Tropical forests’

What is the difference between species richness and index of diversity?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Species richness is simply the number of species in a community. Species diversity is more complex, and includes a measure of the number of species in a community, and a measure of the abundance of each species. Species diversity is usually described by an index, such as Shannon’s Index H’.

How are the tundra and taiga alike?
-----------------------------------

Follow Us: Both the tundra and the taiga biomes have short summers and long winters with low precipitation and permafrost. The same animals and plant species are found in both, such as wolves, brown bears, bees, sedges, grasses and willows.

Which is biome has the greatest species diversity?
--------------------------------------------------

High species diversity : Tropical forests are widely considered to have the greatest species diversity of the terrestrial biomes but diversity is also high in the temperate deciduous biome and Low species diversity : The tundra biome has the least biodiversity, but the northern coniferous biome also has low species diversity.

What are the major biomes in the world?
---------------------------------------

1 Rain Forests. Tropical rainforests are characterized by dense vegetation, 2 Savannas. Savannas are open grasslands with very few trees. 3 Deserts. Deserts are typically dry areas that experience extremely small amounts of rainfall. 4 Chaparrals. Chaparrals, found in coastline regions.

Where are species diversity high in tropical forests?
-----------------------------------------------------

Figure 3. Species diversity is very high in tropical wet forests, such as these forests of Madre de Dios, Peru, near the Amazon River. (credit: Roosevelt Garcia) Tropical rainforests are characterized by vertical layering of vegetation and the formation of distinct habitats for animals within each layer.

How are the major habitats of the world determined?
---------------------------------------------------

Biomes are the world’s major habitats. These habitats are identified by the vegetation and animals that populate them. The location of each land biome is determined by the regional climate. Tropical rainforests are characterized by dense vegetation, seasonally warm temperatures, and abundant rainfall.
