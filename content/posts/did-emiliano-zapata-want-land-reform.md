Did Emiliano Zapata want land reform?
-------------------------------------

Emiliano Zapata led the Liberating Army of the South during the Mexican Revolution. Zapata’s movement began with a demand for land reform, and his beliefs are most often captured by reference to the Plan de Ayala, which he promulgated in 1911.

What was the purpose of Plan de Ayala?
--------------------------------------

The Plan of Ayala was designed to make Zapata’s philosophy clear and draw support from other peasant groups. It had the desired effect as disenfranchised peons from southern Mexico flocked to join Zapata’s army and movement.

What does the Plan de Ayala say?
--------------------------------

It detailed Zapata’s ideology and vision succinctly in the cry “”Reforma, Libertad, Justicia y Ley!” (“Reform, Freedom, Justice and Law!”), later (after Zapata’s death) shortened to “Tierra y Libertad!” (“Land and Freedom!”, a phrase first used by Ricardo Flores Magón as the title for one of his books).

Why did Francisco Zapata want land reform in Mexico?
----------------------------------------------------

Zapata, seeing an opportunity to promote land reform in Mexico, made quiet alliances with Madero, whom he perceived to be the best chance for genuine change in the country. Although he was wary about Madero, Zapata cooperated with him when Madero made vague promises about land reform in his Plan of San Luis Potosí.

What did Zapata do to the Zapatistas?
-------------------------------------

In November 1911, Zapata promulgated the Plan de Ayala which called for substantial land reforms, redistributing lands to the peasants. Madero sent the Federal Army to root out the Zapatistas in Morelos.

What did the Zapatismo plan call for in 1919?
---------------------------------------------

The plan is a denunciation of Madero as well as a manifesto of Zapatismo and what it stood for. It calls for land reform and freedom and would become very important to Zapata’s movement until his assassination in 1919.

When did Madero declare Zapata an outlaw?
-----------------------------------------

Still, once Madero took power in early 1911, he forgot about Zapata and ignored calls for land reform. When Zapata once again took up arms, Madero declared him an outlaw and sent an army after him. The Plan of Ayala Zapata was enraged by Madero’s betrayal and fought against him with both the pen and the sword.
