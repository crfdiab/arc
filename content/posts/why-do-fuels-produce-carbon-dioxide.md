Why do fuels produce carbon dioxide?
------------------------------------

The amount of CO2 produced when a fuel is burned is a function of the carbon content of the fuel. The heat content or the amount of energy produced when a fuel is burned is mainly determined by the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) content of the fuel. Heat is produced when C and H combine with oxygen (O) during combustion.

Do fuels release carbon dioxide?
--------------------------------

The heat content, or the amount of energy produced when a fuel is burned, is mainly determined by the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) content of the fuel….Pounds of CO2 emitted per million British thermal units (Btu) of energy for various fuels.

<table><tr><th>Coal (anthracite)</th><th>228.6</th></tr><tr><td>Gasoline (without ethanol)</td><td>157.2</td></tr><tr><td>Propane</td><td>139.0</td></tr></table>

Why does coal produce more CO2 than natural gas?
------------------------------------------------

Coal, unlike gas fuels and oil, does not emit carbons into the air in its natural state. However, during the mining of coal, methane is released into the air. Coal combustion produces more greenhouse gases than the combustion of any other fossil fuel.

How is carbon dioxide produced when different fuels?
----------------------------------------------------

“Different fuels emit different amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2) in relation to the energy they produce when burned. To analyze emissions across fuels, compare the amount of CO 2 emitted per unit of energy output or heat content.

Why does burning petrol in a car engine produce carbon?
-------------------------------------------------------

Not on its own, and it depends on what is burning. A fire can only produce carbon dioxide if the substance burning with the oxygen contains carbon. And even then, if there are other elements, you will get more substances as products. Carbon will produce carbon dioxide and usually some carbon monoxide as well. Hydrogen will produce water vapor.

Why is carbon dioxide heavier than petrol and diesel?
-----------------------------------------------------

To understand why the total carbon dioxide produced is heavier than the original litre of fuel, we have to look at the chemistry: diesel and petrol are full of carbon, but carbon is quite light. When the fuel burns, the carbon combines with two oxygen molecules (both of which are heavier than the carbon) to create carbon dioxide.

How is heat produced when fuel is burned?
-----------------------------------------

The heat content or the amount of energy produced when a fuel is burned is mainly determined by the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) content of the fuel. Heat is produced when C and H combine with oxygen (O) during combustion. Natural gas is primarily methane (CH 4 ),…
