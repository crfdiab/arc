What do volcano does?
---------------------

Gases and rock shoot up through the opening and spill over or fill the air with lava fragments. Eruptions can cause lateral blasts, lava flows, hot ash flows, mudslides, avalanches, falling ash and floods. Volcano eruptions have been known to knock down entire forests.

What is a volcano Class 7?
--------------------------

An opening in the earth’s crust that allows hot molten lava, ash and gases to escape from below the surface, is called a volcano. The earth is composed of three layers: Crust, Mantle and Core. The mantle consists of magma, on which the lithospheric plates move.

What is formed by a volcano?
----------------------------

Volcanoes are vents, or openings in Earth’s crust, that release ash, gases and steam, and hot liquid rock called lava. When the lava cools and hardens, it forms into the cone-shaped mountain we think of as a volcano.

Where does the term volcano come from and what does it mean?
------------------------------------------------------------

Volcano, vent in the crust of Earth or another planet or satellite, from which issue eruptions of molten rock, hot rock fragments, and hot gases. The term volcano can also refer to the landform created by the accumulation of solidified lava and volcanic debris near the vent.

How is a volcano different from a mountain?
-------------------------------------------

A volcano is an opening in a planet or moon’s crust through which molten rock, hot gases, and other materials erupt. Volcanoes often form a hill or mountain as layers of rock and ash build up from repeated eruptions. Volcanoes are classified as active, dormant, or extinct.

What makes a volcano an active or dormant volcano?
--------------------------------------------------

Volcanoes often form a hill or mountain as layers of rock and ash build up from repeated eruptions. Volcanoes are classified as active, dormant, or extinct. Active volcanoes have a recent history of eruptions; they are likely to erupt again. Dormant volcanoes have not erupted for a very long time but may erupt at a future time.

What are some interesting facts about a volcano?
------------------------------------------------

Volcano facts. Put simply, a volcano is an opening (usually in a mountain) in the Earth’s surface from which gas, hot magma and ash can escape. 2. The word “volcano” comes from the Roman name “Vulcan” – the Roman god of fire. 3. Volcanoes are often found at meeting points of what are called “tectonic plates”.
