Does cloud formation warm the air?
----------------------------------

The base of the cloud forms at the altitude at which the rising air cools and condensation starts. However, rising air remains warmer than the surrounding air and continues to rise. As it rises, more vapor condenses, forming the billowing columns.

How are warm clouds formed?
---------------------------

Warm clouds consist entirely of droplets which have been formed by condensation onto aerosol particles. Above a certain relative humidity soluble particles will deliquesce â€“ the solid particle dissolves in the water it has taken on and becomes a tiny liquid drop, but not yet a cloud drop.

Where are warm clouds found?
----------------------------

These aerosols are found in the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere, which collectively make up the greatest part of the homosphere. Clouds consist of microscopic droplets of liquid water (warm clouds), tiny crystals of ice (cold clouds), or both (mixed phase clouds).

Why do clouds form when the temperature rises?
----------------------------------------------

That warmed air starts to rise because, when warm, it is lighter and less dense than the air around it. As it rises, its pressure and temperature drop causing water vapor to condense. Eventually, enough moisture will condense out of the air to form a cloud.

What kind of clouds form at a cold front?
-----------------------------------------

Clouds that produce rain like nimbostratus and cumulonimbus are also common at warm fronts. At a cold front, where heavy a cold air mass pushes a warm air mass upward, cumulous clouds are common. They often grow into cumulonimbus clouds, which produce thunderstorms. Nimbostratus, stratocumulus, and stratus clouds can also form at cold front.

How are orographic clouds formed in the sky?
--------------------------------------------

Orographic clouds get their shape from mountains or hills that force the air to move over or around them. They can also be formed by sea breezes and often appear as lines where two air masses meet. Weather prediction: An early sign that the conditions might be right to form afternoon thunderstorms!

What happens when warm air rises and cools?
-------------------------------------------

As the moist, hot air rises and cools, water vapor condenses and forms clouds. As it begins to rain, latent heat energy is released from warm air near the surface of the Earth as cold downdrafts accompany the rain as it falls. Larger supercells occasionally give birth to tornadoes, especially during warmer parts of the year.
