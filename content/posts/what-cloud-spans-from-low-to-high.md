What cloud spans from low to high?
----------------------------------

Cumulonimbus clouds  
Cumulonimbus – Cumulonimbus clouds are very tall clouds that span all the way from low level to high level.

What is the name of the cloud that is very tall going from the low level to the high level atmosphere?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the same reason, cumulonimbus is both a low-level and high-level type of cloud. At the low-altitude base, the cloud is mostly made of water droplets but the high-altitude summit is dominated by ice crystals. The rain comes and goes with this cloud but when it does, it can come pouring.

Which cloud is a low level cloud?

Is a stratus cloud high or low?
-------------------------------

Stratus clouds are low-level clouds characterized by horizontal layering with a uniform base, as opposed to convective or cumuliform clouds that are formed by rising thermals.

What are the different types of clouds in the atmosphere?
---------------------------------------------------------

Thus, the 10 types are: 1 Low-level clouds (cumulus, stratus, stratocumulus) that lie below 6,500 feet (1,981 m) 2 Middle clouds (altocumulus, ni 3 High-level clouds (cirrus, cirrocumulus, cirrostratus) that form above 20,000 feet (6,096 m) 4 Cumulonimbus, which tower across the low, middle, and upper atmosphere

Why are small cumulus clouds grouped with low clouds?
-----------------------------------------------------

Small cumulus are commonly grouped with the low clouds because they do not show significant vertical extent. Of the multi-level genus-types, those with the greatest convective activity are often grouped separately as towering vertical. The genus types all have Latin names. The genera are also grouped into five physical forms.

What kind of clouds have large horizontal bands?
------------------------------------------------

Large horizontal bands that appear to converge at the horizon; normally associated with fibratus and uncinus species. Sheets at different layers of the upper troposphere, which may be connected at one or more points; normally associated with fibratus and uncinus species.

What kind of cloud produces showers and thunderstorms?
------------------------------------------------------

The cloud that produces showers and thunderstorms. Credit: Pixabay. Cumulonimbus is fluffy and white like cumulus but the cloud formations are far larger. It’s a vertical developing type of cloud whose base grows from one to up to eight kilometers, hence it’s commonly called a tower cloud.
