What did the US do in ww1?
--------------------------

However, there were also negative effects of the war.

Could the United States have avoided entering world war 1?

Why was the United States neutrality in World War 1?
----------------------------------------------------

What was the outcome of World War 1 without the US?
---------------------------------------------------

Without the backing of American weaponry, munitions and loans, the Allies would have been forced to abandon their goal of the knockout blow. The war might have ended in 1915 or 1916 with a negotiated peace based on the mutual admission that the conflict had become a stalemate.
