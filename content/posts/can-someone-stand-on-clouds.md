Can someone stand on clouds?
----------------------------

Nope. You can’t sit on a cloud, because there’s really nothing there. What you think of as a cloud is basically just air. It looks the way it looks because there are many, many, many tiny droplets of water suspended in the air, which refract the light and make them look white (or gray, depending on conditions).

Can a cloud support weight?
---------------------------

Clouds can hold no weight at all. They are not a coherent material, but consist mostly of air, with tiny droplets of water (or ice crystals) suspended in it. You may have experienced fog. That’s a cloud that’s low enough that you’re inside it when you’re standing on the ground.

Is it possible to sit on a cloud?
---------------------------------

Nope. You can’t sit on a cloud, because there’s really nothing there. What you think of as a cloud is basically just air. It looks the way it looks because there are many, many, many tiny droplets of water suspended in the air, which refract the light and make them look white (or gray, depending on conditions). Those droplets can’t hold you up.

Why do you see clouds move in the sky?
--------------------------------------

A big misconception a lot of people have is that when you see clouds move, they’re not actually moving. Rather, it’s supposed to be the Earth spinning around and what we actually see is the sky spinning around the clouds, not the other way around.

Why does a cloud have to be substantial to walk on?
---------------------------------------------------

The reason is, for a cloud to be substantial enough to walk on (let alone build on) there would have to be some force holding the cloud together, and that force would have to be stronger than the force of you (or your building) forcing it apart.

How tall are the clouds in the sky?
-----------------------------------

A cloud is made of water droplets or tiny ice crystals. Clouds are given different names based on their shape and their height in the sky. Some clouds are near the ground. Others are almost as high as 15,000 meters.. Some are puffy like cotton, others are grey and uniform, like smoke.
