How are buildings made to withstand earthquakes?
------------------------------------------------

To withstand collapse, buildings need to redistribute the forces that travel through them during a seismic event. Shear walls, cross braces, diaphragms, and moment-resisting frames are central to reinforcing a building. Shear walls are a useful building technology that helps to transfer earthquake forces.

How much does it cost to earthquake-proof a building?
-----------------------------------------------------

While there isn’t a standard cost for earthquake retrofitting a home, the range is usually about $3,000 to $7,000. Larger homes, those built on hillsides, and those with basements or rooms over garages will typically cost more to retrofit. Many houses that require only bolting cost about $3,000.

Does earthquake retrofitting increase home value?
-------------------------------------------------

How much is your home worth? A seismic retrofit should add value to the home appraisal. ‘ A marble countertop in a half-bathroom would increase the home’s value about five times its cost, but something that would drastically reduce the damage in a quake has zero impact on its price.

Which is the worst building to withstand an earthquake?
-------------------------------------------------------

Also well constructed wood frame houses are known to ride out earthquakes pretty well. Unreinforced masonry and non-ductile concrete buildings are the worst as they are easily damaged by quakes. How strong an earthquake can a building withstand?

What kind of materials are used in earthquake proof buildings?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Wood and steel have more give than stucco, unreinforced concrete, or masonry, and they are favored materials for building in fault zones. Skyscrapers everywhere must be reinforced to withstand strong forces from high winds, but in quake zones, there are additional considerations. Click to see full answer.

What do you mean by earthquake resistant construction?
------------------------------------------------------

Earthquake-resistant construction. Written By: Earthquake-resistant construction, the fabrication of a building or structure that is able to withstand the sudden ground shaking that is characteristic of earthquakes, thereby minimizing structural damage and human deaths and injuries.

What’s the best way to prepare for an earthquake?
-------------------------------------------------

For a moderate earthquake, the main aim is to protect a building from structural damage. For a major earthquake, however, the goal is to protect life by ensuring a building will not collapse and people can escape from it, even if the building itself is badly damaged.
