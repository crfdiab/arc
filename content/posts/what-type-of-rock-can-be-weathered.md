What type of rock can be weathered?
-----------------------------------

Igneous rocks, especially intrusive igneous rocks such as granite, weather slowly because it is hard for water to penetrate them. Other types of rock, such as limestone, are easily weathered because they dissolve in weak acids. Rocks that resist weathering remain at the surface and form ridges or hills.

How can we prevent weathering of rocks?
---------------------------------------

Power washing cement or asphalt surfaces, and weeding regularly, will prevent the breaking down of such surfaces from the decomposition induced by acids released by lichens or mosses. Likewise, removing large trees can help to prevent the uplifting of rock or cement caused by the trees’ roots.

How are rocks weathered in acid rain water?
-------------------------------------------

The physically weathered ‘High Bridestones’ in North Yorkshire, Northern England. Acid rain water will gradually break up even igneous rocks by slow chemical reactions. Some of the minerals dissolve and free up particles of the insoluble material. Even hard igneous rocks get weathered away eventually over millions of years to form sand grains.

Which is an example of the weathering of a rock?
------------------------------------------------

1 (i) physical weathering examples e.g. Liquid water from rain or melted snow/ice runs into rock cracks. 2 (ii) chemical weathering examples (a sort of ‘corrosion’ of rocks) e.g. Acid rain water will gradually break up even igneous rocks by slow chemical reactions. 3 (iii) biological weathering examples e.g. …

What kind of minerals are affected by acid rain?
------------------------------------------------

Calcium-based minerals such as marble and limestone are particularly vulnerable; this is due to calcium’s reaction with the sulfuric acid in acid rain. Acid rain’s ability to dissolve marble and limestone makes it hazardous to buildings and outdoor monuments.

How are rocks weathered to form sand grains?
--------------------------------------------

Even hard igneous rocks get weathered away eventually over millions of years to form sand grains. Rain is ‘naturally’ acid from – dissolved carbon dioxide from respiration and forest fires, nitrogen oxides from lightning flashes and sulphur dioxide from volcanoes.
