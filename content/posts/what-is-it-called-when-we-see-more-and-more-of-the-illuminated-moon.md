What is it called when we see more and more of the illuminated moon?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

As our Moon continues its orbit counterclockwise around Earth (viewed from above the north pole), more and more of the illuminated part of the Moon becomes visible to us, until it reaches the “full Moon” stage. A full Moon occurs when the Moon has moved in its orbit so that Earth is “between” the Moon and the Sun.

What is it called when you see more of the Moon each day?
---------------------------------------------------------

The amount of the Moon that we can see will grow larger and larger every day. (“Waxing” means increasing, or growing larger.) This Moon is called a Waning Gibbous Moon. This Moon can be seen after the Full Moon, but before the Last Quarter Moon.

What does it mean when the Moon illuminate?
-------------------------------------------

The moon shines because its surface reflects light from the sun. The perceived brightness of the moon from Earth depends on where the moon is in its orbit around the planet. The moon travels once around Earth every 29.5 days, and during its journey, it’s lit from varying angles by the sun.

When the illuminated part of the Moon is getting smaller with each day we say it is?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Waning Moon Shrinks The Waning Gibbous phase is when the lit-up part of the Moon shrinks from 99.9% to 50.1%. It starts just after Full Moon and lasts until the Third Quarter Moon. Waning means that it is shrinking and getting smaller, while gibbous refers to the oval-to-round shape.

What comes after First Quarter moon?
------------------------------------

After the first quarter, the sunlit portion is still increasing, but now it is more than half, so it is waxing gibbous. After the full moon (maximum illumination), the light continually decreases. So the waning gibbous phase occurs next.

What are the names of the different phases of the Moon?
-------------------------------------------------------

An easy way to remember and understand those “between” lunar phase names is by breaking out and defining 4 words: crescent, gibbous, waxing, and waning. The word crescent refers to the phases where the moon is less than half illuminated. The word gibbous refers to phases where the moon is more than half illuminated.

When does the first quarter of a full moon occur?
-------------------------------------------------

The First and Last Quarter phases happen when the Moon is exactly half illuminated, with 50-percent luminosity. When people say “today is a Full Moon” it’s important to remember that doesn’t mean the Moon is full all day long, only that the Full Moon Phase occurs on this day. In reality, the exact moment of the Full Moon can be timed to the second.

What does the far side of the Moon look like?
---------------------------------------------

At that point, the far side of the Moon is facing the Sun. This phase is called a new moon. During the new moon, the side facing Earth is dark. ? New: We cannot see the Moon when it is a new moon. ? Waxing Crescent: In the Northern Hemisphere, we see the waxing crescent phase as a thin crescent of light on the right.

What happens to the light of the Moon after the new moon?
---------------------------------------------------------

After the new moon, the sunlit portion is increasing, but less than half, so it is waxing crescent. After the first quarter, the sunlit portion is still increasing, but now it is more than half, so it is waxing gibbous. After the full moon (maximum illumination), the light continually decreases.
