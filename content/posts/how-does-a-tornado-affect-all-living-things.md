How does a tornado affect all living things?
--------------------------------------------

A tornado effects many living things such as human ,plant life and animals. A tornado kills animals so it will effect the food chain system.

How does a tornado affect the local economy?
--------------------------------------------

The impact of a tornado results in both direct and indirect losses to the local economy. Direct losses result from the destruction of assets from the initial impact of the tornado and include the loss of human lives, roads, power and phone lines, crops, factories, homes, and natural resources.

How does a tornado affect the environment in Oklahoma?
------------------------------------------------------

Also, they contaminate the soil and water, thereby, making the environment a toxic one. Tornadoes that brush through cities destroy lots of property resulting in a major economic impact and indirectly affecting the environment. For example, the Moore twister in 1999, in Oklahoma, caused a damage of about $1.1 billion.

What do people do in the event of a tornado?
--------------------------------------------

For generations, families in regions with significant numbers of tornadoes have built storm cellars where they can take shelter if a tornado occurs. New construction techniques are being developed to make buildings more resistant to strong winds but most people still live in homes which offer limited protection.

How does a tornado affect the economy of Oklahoma?
--------------------------------------------------

This can have a considerable economic impact. In 1999, Oklahoma suffered about $1.1 billion in property damage and crop losses from tornadoes. When you consider the size of Earth, tornadoes have a relatively small effect on the overall environment. However, the areas where tornadoes strike are greatly impacted.

How are tornadoes different from other natural disasters?
---------------------------------------------------------

Tornadoes are different than other natural disasters, such as hurricanes, because they are confined to a relatively small area (typically a few hundred meters wide). Though hurricanes have more total energy, the energy density within a tornado can be much higher. The Enhanced Fujita scale is a measure that determines the strength of a tornado.

Why are tornadoes on the rise in the United States?
---------------------------------------------------

The number of tornadoes in the states that make up Tornado Alley are falling, while tornado events have been on the rise in the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky. There is speculation that some of these changes are linked to climate change and its effect on the jet stream.
