What region is between South America and Antarctica?
----------------------------------------------------

The Drake Passage (referred to as Mar de Hoces \[“Hoces Sea”\] in Spain and other Spanish speaking countries) is the body of water between South America’s Cape Horn, Chile and the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica.

What connects South America and Antarctica?
-------------------------------------------

The South American–Antarctic Ridge (SAAR or AAR) is the tectonic spreading center between the South American Plate and the Antarctic Plate. It runs along the sea-floor from the Bouvet Triple Junction in the South Atlantic Ocean south-westward to a major transform fault boundary east of the South Sandwich Islands.

What continent did Antarctica separate from?
--------------------------------------------

Australia  
Australia began to separate from Antarctica 85 million years ago. The separation started slowly — at a rate of only a few millimetres a year — accelerating to the present rate of 7 cm a year. Australia completely separated from Antarctica about 30 million years ago.

What is the sea that separates South America from Antarctica?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Ocean that separate’s South America from Antarctica is the Southern Ocean. The Sea that separates the tip of South America from the Antarctic peninsula is called the Scotia Sea.

Is there a land bridge between North America and South America?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Isthmus of Panama joins the two continents of North America and South America. It is a land bridge that narrows down to about 50 miles or 80 kilometers at a point. The Drake Passage to the south of Cape Horn separates the continent of Antarctica from South America. There are very few islands found around the continent.

Where is the division between North America and South America?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The division between North America and South America is in the isthmus of Panama, which separates this territory on the border between Panama and Colombia. Most of the Caribbean islands are part of North America; However, Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire are in the south.

How are the continents of Europe and North America separated?
-------------------------------------------------------------

These continents are separated by the Wallace line, which crosses the Malay archipelago. Europe and North America are separated by the Atlantic Ocean. Although Europe borders the Atlantic to the west, Iceland and the archipelago of the Azores (located between Europe and America) are considered part of European territory.
