Do killer bees attack humans?

Which state has the most killer bees?
-------------------------------------

Africanized honey bees can be found in most of mid and southern Texas, about one-third of New Mexico, all over Arizona, the southern half of New Mexico, and the southern third of California. Killer bees continue to migrate northward and have reached most of the southern U.S. up to the Chesapeake Bay area.

How far will killer bees follow you?

A bee can obtain speeds of from 12 to 15 miles per hour, but most healthy humans can outrun them. So, RUN! And when you run Keep Running ! Africanized honey bees have been known to follow people for more than a quarter mile.

Is Killer Bee honey dangerous?
------------------------------

How do you tell the difference between a honey bee and a killer bee?

Is the Africanized honey bee a Killer Bee?
