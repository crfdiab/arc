What type of plate boundary is Surtsey on?
------------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPausePlate Boundaries Surtsey is located almost directly on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is considered a part of the Eurasian plate boundary. It is this geographic situation that contributed to the formation of the island’s iconic volcano.

Is Iceland convergent plate boundary?
-------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseThe tectonic plates whose turbulent interactions formed Iceland, are the Eurasian tectonic plate and the North American tectonic plate. Spanning the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Iceland emerged as a result of the divergent, spreading, boundary between these two plates and the activity of Iceland´s own hotspot or mantle plume.

Is Iceland part of the Eurasian plate?
--------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseIceland sits on the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates. It is the only place in the world where you can see those two tectonic plates and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge above ground.

How old is Surtsey?
-------------------

Hear this out loudPauseSurtsey is a new island formed by volcanic eruptions in 1963-67. It has been legally protected from its birth and provides the world with a pristine natural laboratory. Free from human interference, Surtsey has produced long-term information on the colonisation process of new land by plant and animal life.

How has volcanic activity benefited Iceland?
--------------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseHot springs can be found almost everywhere, and the melt water created by sub-glacial volcanoes provides the country with a potential source of hydroelectric power. All this clean energy has made Iceland one of the least polluted countries in the world.

What kind of a landform is created at divergent plate boundaries?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseTwo landforms that are created from divergent boundaries are rift valleys and mid-oceanic ridges.

Where are the eruptive centres of the Shiveluch volcano?
--------------------------------------------------------

Shiveluch is composed of two eruptive centres, Old Shiveluch and Young Shiveluch. The Young Shiveluch volcanic centre is located within the crater formed by the catastrophic collapse of Old Shiveluch during the Late Pleistocene and it is this younger centre that is the site of all Holocene volcanism.

What kind of rock is the Shiveluch volcano made of?
---------------------------------------------------

About 75% of the volume of Old Shiveluch is constituted by magnesian andesites with from 53.7-63.8% silicate. These andesites were erupted during the initial explosive phase which produced the old pyroclastics forming the base of the complex but also during the initial effusive phase.

How big is the magma chamber of Shiveluch?
------------------------------------------

The top of the peripheral (upper) magma chamber of Shiveluch could be as little as 4 km under the edifice, whilst a larger crustal chamber starting at a depth of 20 km may also be involved in intermediate storage of magma. The chambers have been calculated to have volumes of about 100 and 200 cubic km, respectively (Fedotov et al. 2000.

Where are the Karan domes on the Shiveluch volcano?
---------------------------------------------------

During the evolution of Young Shiveluch, a further dome complex known as the Karan Domes was formed outside of the perimeter of the Old Shiveluch Collapse scar immediately NW of the location of the Baidarny Vent.
