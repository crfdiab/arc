When water condenses in the sky the water droplets form?
--------------------------------------------------------

The air is full of water, even if you can’t see it. Higher in the sky where it is colder than at the land surface, invisible water vapor condenses into tiny liquid water droplets—clouds.

What is it called when water droplets fall from the sky?
--------------------------------------------------------

Rain is liquid precipitation: water falling from the sky. Raindrops fall to Earth when clouds become saturated, or filled, with water droplets.

What is it called when water vapor in the air condenses?
--------------------------------------------------------

Just as water particles condense on grass to form dew, the. tiny airborne particles of water vapor condense into liquid or ice on the surfaces of dust particles in the air. As more water vapor condenses into water droplets, a visible cloud forms.

What are water droplets that condense from the air called?
----------------------------------------------------------

Q. Water droplets that condense from the air onto cool surfaces near the ground are called…. Q. What is relative humidity? Q. The actual amount of water vapor in the air is called

Why do water droplets fall out of the cloud?
--------------------------------------------

Water droplets may grow as a result of additional condensation of water vapor when the particles collide. If enough collisions occur to produce a droplet with a fall velocity which exceeds the cloud updraft speed, then it will fall out of the cloud as precipitation.

What makes up the water vapor in the clouds?
--------------------------------------------

The clouds floating overhead contain water vapor and cloud droplets, which are small drops of condensed water. These droplets are way too small to fall as precipitation, but they are large enough to form visible clouds.

What is the size of a cloud condensation nucleus?
-------------------------------------------------

Cloud condensation nuclei or CCNs (also known as cloud seeds) are small particles typically 0.2 µm, or 1/100 the size of a cloud droplet on which water vapor condenses. Water requires a non-gaseous surface to make the transition from a vapour to a liquid; this process is called condensation.
