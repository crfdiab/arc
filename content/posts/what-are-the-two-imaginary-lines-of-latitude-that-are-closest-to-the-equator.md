What are the two imaginary lines of latitude that are closest to the equator?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

tropic. one of the two imaginary lines around the Earth on either side of the equator. The Tropic of Cancer is 23° 26′ north of it and the Tropic of Capricorn is 23° 26′ south of it.

How are lines of latitude related to the equator?
-------------------------------------------------

A circle of latitude is an imaginary ring linking all points sharing a parallel. The Equator is the line of 0 degrees latitude. Each parallel measures one degree north or south of the Equator, with 90 degrees north of the Equator and 90 degrees south of the Equator. Degrees of latitude are divided into 60 minutes.

What are the two significant latitude lines north of the equator?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn each lie at 23.5 degrees latitude. 1﻿ The Tropic of Cancer is located at 23.5 degrees north of the equator and runs through Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India, and southern China.

Are there lines of latitude above and below the equator?
--------------------------------------------------------

Both the north pole and south pole are at 90 degrees with respect to the equator. So, when you count all of the lines of the latitude above and below the equator. What you get are 180 parallels. And, when you add the equator i.e at 0 degrees, you get 181 degrees of latitudes.

What kind of lines are used to measure latitude?
------------------------------------------------

Latitude is the measurement of distance north or south of the Equator. It is measured with 180 imaginary lines that form circles around the Earth east-west, parallel to the Equator. These lines are known as parallels.

How is a circle of latitude related to the equator?
---------------------------------------------------

A circle of latitude is an imaginary ring linking all points sharing a parallel. The Equator is the line of 0 degrees latitude. Each parallel measures one degree north or south of the Equator, with 90 degrees north of the Equator and 90 degrees south of the Equator.

How are lines of longitude and latitude parallel?
-------------------------------------------------

They are parallel. Lines of longitude run from the top of the Earth to the bottom. They are not parallel as lines of latitude are – they meet at a point at the north and south poles and are called meridians. They divide the Earth into segments, like an orange.
