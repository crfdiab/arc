How is seafloor spreading different from continental drift?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Supporters of continental drift originally theorized that the continents moved (drifted) through unmoving oceans. Seafloor spreading proves that the ocean itself is a site of tectonic activity. Seafloor spreading is just one part of plate tectonics. Subduction is another.

How did Hess’s hypothesis explain seafloor movement?
----------------------------------------------------

Hess envisaged that oceans grew from their centres, with molten material (basalt) oozing up from the Earth’s mantle along the mid ocean ridges. This created new seafloor which then spread away from the ridge in both directions.

How does molten material on the ocean floor support the theory of seafloor spreading?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sea floor spreads apart along both sides of a mid-ocean ridge as new crust is added. As a result, the ocean floors move like conveyor belts, carrying the continents along with them. Molten material erupts through the valley that runs along the center of some mid-ocean ridges.

What did Harry Hess find significant about mid ocean ridges quizlet?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Hess’s theory that new seafloor is formed when magma is forced upward toward the surface at a mid-ocean ridge. Scientist that came up with the theory of seafloor spreading. Hess hypothesis that hot, less dense material below Earth’s crust rises toward the surface at the mid – ocean ridge.

What do ridges and rises have in common?
----------------------------------------

They both have a prominent rift valley at the ridge axis. They are both associated with divergent plate boundaries. They are both found predominantly on land. They are both steep and rugged.

Which feature of Earth is created at mid-ocean ridges quizlet?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge. Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.
