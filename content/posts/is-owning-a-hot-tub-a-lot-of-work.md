Is owning a hot tub a lot of work?
----------------------------------

People tell us that hot tubs are a lot of work and that is actually true. When you look at a competitor’s hot tub or one that was made years ago, they were designed to require 12 hours of maintenance, $230 worth of chemicals, and filters that cost as much as $175 per year.

Is hiring a hot tub worth it?
-----------------------------

Choosing to hire a hot tub ensures you that you will always have a hot tub that works well and is in a good and safe condition. Hiring a hot tub can also save you money in the long-term, because you are only paying for the time you use the hot tub, rather than having to invest in the full price cost.

How much does a typical hot tub cost?
-------------------------------------

The average price of a hot tub can range from about $3,000 to $16,000 and more. While the initial cost can seem like sticker shock, it’s important to zoom out and consider your long-term value and enjoyment in the tub that you select.

Is a hot tub high maintenance?
------------------------------

Is a hot tub HIGH maintenance? Not really. It just requires a basic understanding of water chemistry and a simple schedule (which we’ll dive into), but it’s not expensive. All you really need is some chemicals and testing supplies which is about a $20/month investment.

Can you insure a hot tub?
-------------------------

Yes, structures like your conservatory, garden wall, fitted hot tubs and paving could be covered by your buildings insurance, as they are technically classed as fixtures and fittings of your home. An example of this could be a barbeque, or your garden’s table and chairs.

Can hot tubs be used indoors?
-----------------------------

Yes, you can have a hot tub inside. Hot tubs can be installed either outdoors or inside a house. In fact, it’s sometimes easier to install your hot tub indoors when compared to outdoors, but of course, the experience will be different depending on whether your tub is outside or inside.

How far should a hot tub be from the house?
-------------------------------------------

Having your hot tub right next to the wall of your home is probably too close. The steam that comes from the water may seep into windows and water splashed from the tub may cause a slippery walkway. A few feet away from your home and a few feet away from your walkway is typically the ideal combination.

Are Costco hot tubs a good deal?
