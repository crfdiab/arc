What food did pioneers eat on the Oregon Trail?
-----------------------------------------------

The mainstays of a pioneer diet were simple fare like potatoes, beans and rice, hardtack (which is simply flour, water, 1 teaspoon each of salt and sugar, then baked), soda biscuits (flour, milk, one t. each of carbonate of soda and salt), Johnny cakes, cornbread, cornmeal mush, and bread.

What did pioneers bring on the Oregon Trail?
--------------------------------------------

The pioneers would take with them as many supplies as possible. They took cornmeal, bacon, eggs, potatoes, rice, beans, yeast, dried fruit, crackers, dried meat, and a large barrel of water that was tied to the side of the wagon. The cow was used for milk and meat if they ran out of food.

What did Pioneers do for fun on the Oregon Trail?
-------------------------------------------------

What did pioneers do for fun on the Oregon Trail? They had races and played games such as Sheep Over the River, Hide and Seek, Pull the Rope, and Steal-Stick Duck-Stones. They also sang and danced. They made dolls from corn cobs and rags and used a bladder balloon for ball games.

What kind of flour did the Oregon Trail pioneers use?
-----------------------------------------------------

Ingredient number one on any responsible pioneer’s packing list was flour. A family of four typically needed 600 pounds – that’s as heavy as one male grizzly bear – to survive the whole trip. The most common type of flour was called shorts, a cross between rough bran (good for fiber, BTW) and a coarse, ground flour.

When did the settlers start the Oregon Trail?
---------------------------------------------

Oregon Trail preparedness: What supplies did the settlers carry? The year was 1834, a year that didn’t really stand out as all that particularly important in American history. But like any other year, it had its share of firsts.

What foods did people eat on the Oregon Trail?
----------------------------------------------

But given that they ate the same foods over and over, they really needed something to sweeten things up. Travelers mostly carried brown sugar, which went through fewer processes than white sugar, so it was cheaper. However, it still contained molasses, which could make the sugar run in the hot sun.
