What looks bigger the stars or the moon?
----------------------------------------

We take it for granted these days that the stars are unimaginably bigger than the planets and the moons. But when you look at the sky, it does not appear this way. The moon looks bigger and brighter than the stars.

What is bigger than a star?
---------------------------

A solar system is a star and all of its planets, asteroids, comets and other bodies. It is significantly bigger than a star. A galaxy, such as our Milky Way Galaxy, is a collection of solar systems orbiting around a central core.

What is bigger than the moon?
-----------------------------

Earth is much bigger than Moon. Diameter of Earth is 12756 kilometers. Moon diameter is only 3475 Kilometers/.

Who is the biggest moon and star?
---------------------------------

The largest known star in the universe is UY Scuti, a hypergiant with a radius around 1,700 times larger than the sun.

Which is the hottest star in the Universe?
------------------------------------------

But the hottest known stars in the Universe are the blue hypergiant stars. These are stars with more than 100 times the mass of the Sun. One of the best known examples is Eta Carinae, located about 7,500 light-years from the Sun.

Which is bigger the Moon or the Earth?
--------------------------------------

Mars is then much larger than the moon (which is only 14% of Mars volume). So yes, even little stars (which are unusually small) are far bigger than the Earth, the moon, or Mars. Tony Fredericks, I keep up with as much as I can. Google is a great resource Some consider neutron stars to be stars.

Which is smaller the Moon or the star?
--------------------------------------

The star looks so small, so they must be the smallest. The moon looks bigger than the stars, so they must be bigger. You cannot see the Earth completely, so probably it is smaller than the moon. And your brain, you cannot see that at all, so probably it is way smaller! Does that answer your question? I hope not.

Which is bigger a star or a planet?
-----------------------------------

The star is by far the bighest, then the earth, then the moon. Definitely a star is more bigger than the planet ,moon or some other celestial bodies like asteroids,dwarf planet etc. For most of the cases ( â€˜coz a neutron star may have size smaller than earth!) , the order should be:

Is the Moon a planet or a star?
-------------------------------

The moon is neither a planet nor a star. Instead, it is a satellite.
