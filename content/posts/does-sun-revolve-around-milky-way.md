Does Sun revolve around Milky Way?
----------------------------------

Yes, the Sun – in fact, our whole solar system – orbits around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. We are moving at an average velocity of 828,000 km/hr. But even at that high rate, it still takes us about 230 million years to make one complete orbit around the Milky Way!

How many times has the Earth orbited the galaxy?
------------------------------------------------

The folks behind Galactic Tick Day went with an estimate of 225 million. Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old, which means it has lived through about 20 complete loops around the galaxy.

Can I see the Milky Way from my location?
-----------------------------------------

You can see the Milky Way all year, no matter where you are in the world. It’s visible just so long as the sky is clear and the light pollution is minimal. The location is almost the same, but you will notice that the Milky Way appears to move.

How long does it take the sun to orbit the center of the Milky Way?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Bottom line: The planets in our solar system orbit (revolve) around the sun, and the sun orbits (revolves) around the center of the Milky Way galaxy. We take about 225-250 million years to revolve once around the galaxy’s center. This length of time is called a cosmic year.

Is the Milky Way galaxy revolves around something?
--------------------------------------------------

Answer is YES, Milky Way Galaxy revolves around something and revolves around itself just like the Earth. Actually the entire Milky Way Galaxy, revolves around our neighbor Andromeda Galaxy. Also, Andromeda is spinning around itself.

How many miles an hour does our Solar System move?
--------------------------------------------------

Meanwhile, our entire solar system – our sun with its family of planets, moon, asteroid and comets – orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Our sun and solar system move at about about 500,000 miles an hour (800,000 km/hr) in this huge orbit.

What happens to the Sun as it moves through the Galaxy?
-------------------------------------------------------

But as the Sun moves through the disk of the galaxy, it also encounters giant molecular clouds in which new stars are forming. These clouds can also alter the Sun’s orbit.
