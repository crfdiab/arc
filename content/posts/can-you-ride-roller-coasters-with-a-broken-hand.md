Keep in mind there are no “weight restrictions” on any of Universal’s theme-park attractions; instead, it comes down to how your unique body dimensions fit inside each ride’s restraint system.

    Where are the restraints at Universal Studios Florida?
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
    The vast majority of the time, the problem concerns the restraint system. Let’s take a look at this issue in detail, shall we? Located near the attraction entrance, each of Universal’s thrill rides has a mock-up of the seats and restraints used in the ride vehicle.
    
    Do you have to buckle seat belts at Universal Studios?
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
    If you can buckle the test seat’s straps easily, you should be able to ride in the modified seats with no problem. If you fit, but just barely, you’ll need the help of another party member. Make sure you get seated first and have your companion push the restraint down enough until you can get it buckled.
    
    Can you have a hand tattoo at Universal Studios?
    ------------------------------------------------

    Why is it difficult to get out of Universal Studios ride?
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    The problem occurs when you try to get out. The constant deluge of water makes the ride vehicle floors very slippery; when you attempt to exit the vehicle, you may have great difficulty, as I do, because the opening can be very tight for a large person, and it’s almost impossible to get your feet under your body to lift with your legs.
