What are some unique features of deserts?
-----------------------------------------

Unique Features of Deserts

- Alluvial Fans and Bajadas. Alluvial fans are large fan-shaped piles of loose gravel, sand, silt and clay which occur on flat plains, at the base of narrow desert canyons and at the foot of desert mountain ranges.
- Desert Varnish.
- Highly Drought-tolerant Vegetation.

What physical features are in desert?
-------------------------------------

Valleys, which are low-lying areas between mountains or hills, and canyons, which are narrow valleys with very steep sides, are also landforms found in many deserts. Flat regions called plains, sand dunes, and oases are other desert landscape features.

What is the major feature of all deserts?
-----------------------------------------

The characteristics of hot deserts include high temperatures in summer; greater evaporation than precipitation, usually exacerbated by high temperatures, strong winds and lack of cloud cover; considerable variation in the occurrence of precipitation, its intensity and distribution; and low humidity.

What physical features mean?
----------------------------

Human and physical features are things that you can see all around you. Physical features like seas, mountains and rivers are natural. They would be here even if there were no people around. Human features like houses, roads and bridges are things that have been built by people.

Which is the most common feature of a desert?
---------------------------------------------

The most common landscape features found in deserts are sand dunes, yardangs, desert pavements, debris, playas, oases, mesas, alluvial fans, arroyos and buttes. These landforms vary from desert to desert. Sand dunes are thought of as a typical feature in most deserts, but these landforms occupy only a relatively small part of deserts in the world.

How are sand dunes different from other deserts?
------------------------------------------------

Deserts differ greatly in their land features. They may include dunes of shifting sand, mountains, bare rock, and plains of gravel and boulders. Sand dunes are not as common in deserts as many people think. For example, they make up only about 10 percent of the Sahara of northern Africa.

Why are there few plants in the desert?
---------------------------------------

Though they are very dry, the main reason they have few plants is that it is so cold there. A cold desert covers much of Antarctica. The Gobi in central Asia is another cold desert. Desert plants and animals have features that help them survive in the dry climate.

What kind of rock is found in the desert?
-----------------------------------------

Yardangs are the bare rock surfaces found in most deserts. These features occur where surface particles have been removed by wind, which leaves the hard bedrock exposed. Desert pavements are tightly compacted layers of rock and gravel that cover mostly flat areas.
