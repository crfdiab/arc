How does greenhouse gas emissions affect the environment?
---------------------------------------------------------

Greenhouse gases have far-ranging environmental and health effects. They cause climate change by trapping heat, and they also contribute to respiratory disease from smog and air pollution. Extreme weather, food supply disruptions, and increased wildfires are other effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gases.

What is human emissions of greenhouse gases?
--------------------------------------------

Human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years. 1. The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United States is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.

How are humans affected by the greenhouse effect?
-------------------------------------------------

CONSEQUENCES OF THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT ON HUMAN HEALTH In addition to the problems derived directly from pollution, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that global warming will cause infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera or dengue to spread to many more areas of the planet.

What is the effect of increased CO2 emissions?
----------------------------------------------

The amount of carbon emissions trapped in our atmosphere causes global warming, which causes climate change, symptoms of which include melting of the polar ice caps, the rising of sea levels, the disturbance of animals’ natural habitats, extreme weather events, and so many more negative side effects that are dangerous …

What are ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?
-------------------------------------------------

Greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by making power on-site with renewables and other climate-friendly energy resources. Examples include rooftop solar panels, solar water heating, small-scale wind generation, fuel cells powered by natural gas or renewable hydrogen, and geothermal energy.

What are the factors affecting greenhouse gas?
----------------------------------------------

Natural factors, such as variations in the sun’s output, volcanic activity, the Earth’s orbit, the carbon cycle, and others, also affect Earth’s radiative balance. However, beginning in the late 1700s, the net global effect of human activities has been a continual increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.
