Why is moon visible at night?
-----------------------------

Answer: The moon does not shine by its own light, but by the reflected light of the sun. We see the moon because the sun is shining on it. But because it is so close to the earth, it provides enough light at night to cast shadows when it is full or nearly full.

Why does the moon appear bright in the night sky?
-------------------------------------------------

The Moon gets its light from the Sun. In the same way that the Sun illuminates Earth, the Moon reflects the Sun’s light, making it appear bright in our sky.

Why is the moon visible today?
------------------------------

How the moon becomes visible in the day. The moon rises in the east and sets in the west just like everything else in the night sky. That’s because Earth is rotating from west to east. The moon is orbiting in the same direction, also from west to east.

Why is there no moon in the sky at night?
-----------------------------------------

You will also have no evidence of the moon in the sky during the day, as the sun will wash out any visible signs. During the phases, the moon travels through the sky and will only reach just above the horizon or very low in the sky during the night.

When is the Moon visible in the morning sky?
--------------------------------------------

At this time it rises in the middle of the night, and is visible in the morning sky. The Moon is said to be waxing in the period between new moon and full moon, when it is visible in the evening sky and the illuminated portion of its disk is growing from one night to the next.

What does it mean when it is a moonless night?
----------------------------------------------

A moonless night is, as you suspect, a night in which the Moon does not appear visible in the sky. This happens once per month, when the Moon is near the Sun. Due to the proximity of the Moon and the Sun in the sky, at that time the Moon is the smallest sliver possible, and therefore not a full moon. This is because it is actually…

Why is the Moon less visible during the day?
--------------------------------------------

However, with the passage of each day, the moon keeps getting nearer to the sun until finally it appears to be very close (around the time of a new moon), rising and setting at almost the same time as the sun. The upshot of this is that the moon becomes less visible at night and more visible during the daytime.
