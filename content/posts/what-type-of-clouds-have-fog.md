What type of clouds have fog?
-----------------------------

Stratus cloud often look like thin, white sheets covering the whole sky. Since they are so thin, they seldom produce much rain or snow. Sometimes, in the mountains or hills, these clouds appear to be fog. Cumulonimbus clouds grow on hot days when warm, wet air rises very high into the sky.

What type of stratus cloud is fog?
----------------------------------

Discriminating Stratus from Fog Stratus is used to describe flat, featureless clouds of low altitude, typically less than 300 metres. On the other hand, fog is a stratus cloud in contact with the ground. Horizontal visibility in fog is less than 1 km.

What’s the difference between a fog and a cloud?
------------------------------------------------

Fog forms only at low altitudes. Clouds can form at many different altitudes. They can be as high as 12 miles above sea level or as low as the ground. Fog is a kind of cloud that touches the ground. Fog forms when the air near the ground cools enough to turn its water vapor into liquid water or ice.

What makes a fog form in the air?
---------------------------------

Fog is a form of cloud which consists of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air near the earth’s surface and it is influenced by water bodies, climate, etc. There are 8 types of fogs present, they are:

What kind of fog is composed of ice crystals?
---------------------------------------------

When composed of ice crystals, it is called ice fog. (1) Advection fog. Advection fog forms due to moist air moving over a colder surface, and the resulting cooling of the near-surface air to below its dew-point temperature. Advection fog occurs over both water (e.g., steam fog) and land. (2) Radiation fog (ground or valley fog).
