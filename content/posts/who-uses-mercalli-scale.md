Who uses Mercalli scale?
------------------------

Very often, non-geologists use this scale, because it is easier for people to describe what damage an earthquake caused, than to do calculations to get a value on the Richter scale. Values range from I – Instrumental to XII – Catastrophic. Giuseppe Mercalli (1850-1914) originally developed the scale, with ten levels.

What is the modified Mercalli scale used for?
---------------------------------------------

Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale This is a semi-quantitative scale used to evaluate ground shaking and damage. This scale is composed of 12 increasing levels of intensity based on observed effects. These range from imperceptible shaking to catastrophic destruction, designated by Roman numerals.

Why don’t we use the Mercalli scale?
------------------------------------

The Richter scale was abandoned because it worked best for earthquakes in southern California, and only those hitting within about 370 miles (600 kilometers) of seismometers. These days, scientists detect temblors on the other side of the Earth.

What is the used of Mercalli scale and Rossi Forel scale?
---------------------------------------------------------

Intensity scales, like the Modified Mercalli Scale and the Rossi-Forel scale, measure the amount of shaking at a particular location. An earthquake causes many different intensities of shaking in the area of the epicenter where it occurs. In the United States, we use the Modified Mercalli (MMI) Scale.

What is the use of Rossi Forel scale?
-------------------------------------

The Rossi–Forel scale was one of the first seismic scales to represent earthquake intensities.

What are the disadvantages of the Richter Scale?
------------------------------------------------

Disadvantages of Richter Scale Earthquakes can cause subsidence, or the lowering of the ground surface. This can cause coastal areas to be permanently flooded. Lateral spreading can also occur, wherein sloping ground moves downhill, opening up cracks.

Who is the creator of the Mercalli scale?
-----------------------------------------

The Mercalli Intensity Scale was developed by Italian volcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli in 1884 and expanded to include 12 degrees of intensity in 1902 by Adolfo Cancani. It was modified again by Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann in 1931. It is known today as the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale.

What are the levels of the Modified Mercalli scale?
---------------------------------------------------

Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale. This is a semi-quantitative scale used to evaluate ground shaking and damage. This scale is composed of 12 increasing levels of intensity based on observed effects. These range from imperceptible shaking to catastrophic destruction,…

When was the Mercalli earthquake intensity scale created?
---------------------------------------------------------

The Mercalli intensity scale is a seismic intensity scale used for measuring the intensity of an earthquake. It measures the effects of an earthquake. The Italian volcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli revised the widely used simple ten-degree Rossi–Forel scale between 1884 and 1906, creating the Mercalli Intensity scale which is still used nowadays.

What kind of scale is the Richter scale?
----------------------------------------

The Richter Scale is a numerical scale that measures the magnitude of the earthquake. The Richter Scale uses numbers to measure. What is the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale Level? The Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale is a seismic scale, used for measuring the intensity of an earthquake.
