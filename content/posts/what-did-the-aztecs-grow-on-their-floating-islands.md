What did the Aztecs grow on their floating islands?
---------------------------------------------------

The Aztecs used stunning floating gardens — otherwise known as chinampas — to grow their crops without harming the environment. Chinampas were created by piling mud and decaying plants into small stationary islands on top of which the farmers would sow maize, beans, chilies, squash, tomatoes, and greens.

Where did the Aztecs farmed?
----------------------------

To grow all this food, the Aztecs used two main farming methods: the chinampas and terracing. Chinampas were essentially man-made islands, raised bed gardens on the surface of Lake Texcoco’s shallow waters.

How did the Aztecs use floating gardens?
----------------------------------------

To feed their enormous population, the Aztecs ingeniously built chinampas, or floating gardens, to convert the marshy wetlands of Lake Texcoco into arable farmland. These floating gardens were a masterpiece of engineering. Each garden was lined on all sides by canals to allow canoes to pass with workers and materials.

What did the Aztecs farm?
-------------------------

Aztec Farm crops Farms included crops of maize, beans, and squash. Tomatoes and chilies were also popular crops. But the gardens and particularly the chinampas were used to grow large amounts of flowers, making the Aztec farming land an even more lush and colourful place.

Did Chinampas really float?
---------------------------

Sometimes referred to as “floating gardens,” chinampas are artificial islands that were created by interweaving reeds with stakes beneath the lake’s surface, creating underwater fences. The bodies of land appeared to be “floating” on the water because the canals surrounded the chinampa plots.

Why did the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan build chinampas?
---------------------------------------------------

Certainly there were a number of techniques used in the Aztec empire. But with the great city of Tenochtitlan built on swampy but rich ground, the chinampas became key to the food production of the people. These canals of course offered irrigation, and provided food of their own such as fish and water fowl.

What did the Aztecs use the floating islands for?
-------------------------------------------------

The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, was surrounded with chinampas, small artificial islands used for agriculture known as “floating gardens” (though not really floating). Floating gardens on a large scale have been demonstrated with aquaponics systems in China growing rice, wheat and canna lily on islands,…

How did the floating gardens of the Aztecs work?
------------------------------------------------

The Floating Gardens of the Aztecs. The rectangular gardens were anchored to the lake by willow trees planted at the corners. Each garden was lined on all sides by canals to allow canoes to pass with workers and materials. This network of gardens extended for 22,000 acres across the surface of the lake.

How did the Aztecs make the Lake Texcoco livable?
-------------------------------------------------

At 2,100 square miles, Lake Texcoco was not an easy environment to make livable. But the Aztecs converted much of the nearby freshwater lakes and swampland into floating gardens, called chinampas, and enjoyed multiple harvests per year. Chinampas: Aztec Floating Gardens

What did the Aztecs do to feed their people?
--------------------------------------------

The Floating Gardens of the Aztecs. Tenochtitlan, now Mexico City, was the biggest and best-fed city in the world, and this fortress city was completely surrounded by water. To feed their enormous population, the Aztecs ingeniously built chinampas, or floating gardens, to convert the marshy wetlands of Lake Texcoco into arable farmland.
