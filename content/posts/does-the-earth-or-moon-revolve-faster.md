Does the Earth or Moon revolve faster?
--------------------------------------

When the moon is closest to Earth, its rotation is slower than its journey through space, allowing observers to see an additional 8 degrees on the eastern side. When the moon is farthest, the rotation is faster, so an additional 8 degrees are visible on the western side.

Does the Earth and moon revolve?
--------------------------------

Does the Moon orbit Earth? Yes. The Moon takes about one month to orbit Earth (27.3 days to complete a revolution, but 29.5 days to change from New Moon to New Moon). As the Moon completes each 27.3-day orbit around Earth, both Earth and the Moon are moving around the Sun.

Is the Moon’s speed equal to the Earth’s?
-----------------------------------------

The moon has a certain speed from its orbit around the Earth. Let’s call this x. The Earth has a certain speed from its orbit around the Sun. Let’s call this y. Since the moon is “stuck” to the Earth and moves with it, it also has speed y from going around the Sun at the same rate. Therefore, the moon’s speed is equal to x + y.

Why does the Moon rotate at the same time every month?
------------------------------------------------------

If you stood on the Moon, the stars would rise and set, just like they do on Earth, except that a lunar day is a month long, the same as the Moon’s orbital period. The Moon rotates at just the right speed so that it always keeps one face pointed toward the Earth, which seems like a pretty big coincidence, doesn’t it?

Do all the planets orbit the Sun at the same speed?
---------------------------------------------------

All of the planets are orbiting the sun, so the mass is the same, but the distance is different. Click to see full answer. Also asked, do all the planets rotate at the same speed? Each planet in the solar system has its own unique rotation rate. Tiny Mercury, sizzling closest to the Sun, takes 59 Earth days to turn around just once.

How fast does the Earth travel while orbiting the Sun?
------------------------------------------------------

How Fast Does the Earth Travel While Orbiting the Sun? In addition to the rotational speed of the Earth spinning on its axis, the planet is also speeding at about 66,660 miles per hour (107,278.87 km/h) in its revolution around the sun once every 365.2425 days.
