What causes a sea storm?
------------------------

The main cause of a storm surge is high winds pushing the seawater towards the coast, causing it to pile up there. In the case of tropical storms (such as hurricanes), there may also be a very large amount of rain which further increases the risk of flooding.

What storm generates in Caribbean Sea?
--------------------------------------

Caribbean hurricanes are one of the most frequent natural disasters that impact the Caribbean. A hurricane is a tropical cyclone with sustained one-minute winds of at least 74 miles per hour. They are created when warm water hits the troposphere and high pressure pushes warm, dry air down in the center.

What are the possible causes of storm in coastal areas?
-------------------------------------------------------

Answer: Small localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground, resulting in smaller disturbances such as dust Coastal Storm – Large wind waves and/or storm surge that strike the coastal zone.

What causes and hurricane?
--------------------------

Hurricanes form over the warm ocean water of the tropics. When warm moist air over the water rises, it is replaced by cooler air. The cooler air will then warm and start to rise. If there is enough warm water, the cycle will continue and the storm clouds and wind speeds will grow causing a hurricane to form.

What happens when there is a storm at sea?
------------------------------------------

A storm surge is a rise in sea level that occurs during tropical cyclones, intense storms also known as typhoons or hurricanes. The storms produce strong winds that push the water into shore, which can lead to flooding. The water level rises where the winds are strongest.

What kind of storms happen at sea?
----------------------------------

In the North Atlantic Ocean, Northeast Pacific Ocean, and South Pacific Ocean, they are called “hurricanes,” but in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, they are called “typhoons.” In the Southwest Pacific Ocean or Southeast Indian Ocean, they are called “severe tropical cyclones.” In the North Indian Ocean, they are called “ …

How do shorelines affect weather?
---------------------------------

Coasts are sensitive to sea level rise, changes in the frequency and intensity of storms, increases in precipitation, and warmer ocean temperatures. In addition, rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) are causing the oceans to absorb more of the gas and become more acidic.

What makes an extreme storm in the ocean?
-----------------------------------------

They found that extreme storms – those producing at least 0.12 inches (3 millimeters) of rain per hour over a 16-mile (25-kilometer) area – formed when the sea surface temperature was higher than about 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degrees Celsius).

What causes foam to form in the ocean?
--------------------------------------

When the ocean is agitated by wind and waves this can create the froth-like foam. It can also be caused by decomposed materials from the seas animals and excreta. As these tides move continuously they form bubbles of air and are moved towards the sea-shore because of the pull of the currents.

How did Jesus calm the sea during the storm?
--------------------------------------------

With one quick word from Christ, the storm abated and the sea became calm (Mark 4:39). The apostles marveled at this powerful display of Jesus’ supernatural ability over the elements (Luke 8:25). This can be immensely comforting to the Christian in a storm.

Are there sea foam storms in the UK?
------------------------------------

Coastal areas in Europe and the UK have also experienced sea foam, a phenomenon only created in fairly rare, stormy circumstances.
