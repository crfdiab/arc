What is the largest active volcano in the United States?
--------------------------------------------------------

Yellowstone is one of the largest known volcanoes in the world and the largest volcanic system in North America.

Is Yellowstone pyroclastic?
---------------------------

The Yellowstone region has produced three exceedingly large volcanic eruptions in the past 2.1 million years. Pyroclastic flows from this eruption left thick volcanic deposits known as the Lava Creek Tuff, which can be seen in the south-facing cliffs east of Madison, where they form the north wall of the caldera.

Does Alaska has the highest number of active volcanoes for an American state?

Is Yellowstone the largest supervolcano?
----------------------------------------

The largest (super) eruption at Yellowstone (2.1 million years ago) had a volume of 2,450 cubic kilometers. Like many other caldera-forming volcanoes, most of Yellowstone’s many eruptions have been smaller than VEI 8 supereruptions, so it is confusing to categorize Yellowstone as a “supervolcano.”
