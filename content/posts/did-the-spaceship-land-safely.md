Did the spaceship land safely?
------------------------------

SpaceX has safely landed 4 astronauts in the ocean for NASA, completing the US’s longest human spaceflight. SpaceX’s Crew Dragon Resilience spaceship has returned to Earth and landed in the Gulf of Mexico.

Did SpaceX land back on Earth?
------------------------------

The four astronauts aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule “Resilience” safely returned to Earth on Sunday, splashing down in parachutes landing in the Gulf of Mexico after a record-setting mission to the International Space Station.

What causes a spacecraft to re-enter the Earth?
-----------------------------------------------

B­ringing it back is another. Spacecraft re-entry is tricky business for several reasons. When an object enters the Earth’s atmosphere, it experiences a few forces, including gravity and drag. Gravity will naturally pull an object back to earth. But gravity alone would cause the object to fall dangerously fast.

When a mission is finished and the shuttle is halfway around the world from the landing site (Kennedy Space Center, Edwards Air Force Base), mission control gives the command to come home, which prompts the crew to:

How does a space shuttle come back to Earth?
--------------------------------------------

When it was time to come back to Earth in both the shuttle and Soyuz, we turned the spacecraft around backward, fired the engine for a few minutes, slowed down by a few hundred mph, and our orbital flight path trajectory was bent downward toward the planet.

How does NASA decide where spacecraft will land when they land?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Windows are the result of backwards planning. For each end goal, be it landing in California, docking with the ISS , or touchdown on the moon, backwards planning can be used to calculate the earliest and latest start time that will lead to that outcome. Often, the inputs are complex.
