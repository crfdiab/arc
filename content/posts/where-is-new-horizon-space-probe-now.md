Where is New Horizon space probe now?
-------------------------------------

Currently exploring the Kuiper Belt beyond Pluto, New Horizons is just one of five spacecraft to reach 50 astronomical units – 50 times the distance between the Sun and Earth – on its way out of the solar system and, eventually, into interstellar space.

How long will New Horizons probe last?
--------------------------------------

Though it’s been streaking through space for 15 years, the probe remains in perfect health, Stern said, and it could continue to study its exotic environs for many years to come. “We have power and fuel to go on into the late 2030s,” said Stern, who’s based at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado.

Jul 14, 2020 – Five years ago today, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft made history. After a voyage of nearly 10 years and more than 3 billion miles, the intrepid piano-sized probe flew within 7,800 miles of Pluto. For the first time ever, we saw the surface of this distant world in spectacular, colored detail.

What did NASA’s New Horizons discover around Pluto?
---------------------------------------------------

In 2015, NASA’s New Horizons space probe whizzed by Pluto. Now it has sent back all of its data, what did it see and discover? In this video, I showcase the journey New Horizons took in order to get to Pluto, its moons, geological features, and Pluto’s atmosphere. A big thank you to brilliant.org for supporting this video.
