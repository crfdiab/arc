What are the rules for common law marriage in Texas?
----------------------------------------------------

According to Chapter 2.401 the Texas Family Code, a common law marriage must have these three elements:

- The couple has agreed to be married;
- The couple has agreed to live together as husband and wife;

It makes it harder for you to prove a common law marriage existed if you wait for more than two years after you separate before taking action.
    
    How does a declaration of marriage work in Texas?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    A declaration of marriage may be used to validate or prove a common law marriage is in existence. The declaration also allows the parties to identify on what date the couple agrees to the marriage. A declaration of marriage can help make your common law marriage “official” in Texas.
    
    How old do you have to be to get married in Texas?
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    You must show that you and your partner: are not already married, informally or formally, to anyone else at the time the marriage was created, AND both you and your partner were at least 18 years of age when the marriage was created; and afterward, lived in Texas as a married couple, and
