How are valley and canyons similar?
-----------------------------------

Both are depressions in the landscape, often formed by the movement of water such as rivers. Often the terms are used interchangeably, but most geologists will tell you the major difference between them is that canyons are deeper, more narrow and with steep sides.

What type of valleys are canyons?
---------------------------------

Canyon, deep, steep-walled, V-shaped valley cut by a river through resistant rock. Such valleys often occur in the upper courses of rivers, where the stream has a strong, swift current that digs its valley relatively rapidly. Smaller valleys of similar appearance are called gorges.

What are the similarities between gorges and canyons?
-----------------------------------------------------

A gorge is a narrow valley with steep, rocky walls located between hills or mountains. The term comes from the French word gorge, which means throat or neck. A gorge is often smaller than a canyon, although both words are used to describe deep, narrow valleys with a stream or river running along their bottom.

How is a valley formed?
-----------------------

These geological formations are created by running rivers and shifting glaciers. Valleys are depressed areas of land–scoured and washed out by the conspiring forces of gravity, water, and ice. Some hang; others are hollow.

Are canyons located in deserts?
-------------------------------

Join Grand Canyon National Park Trips For many of us, Arizona conjures up images of a vast desert with canyons that are deep and rock formations that jut out of a stark landscape. And this is no surprise. The Grand Canyon state is home to two prominent deserts, the Sonoran and Mojave.

Are valleys in canyons?
-----------------------

The main difference between canyon and valley is that canyons are deeper and have steeper sides than valleys. Canyons and valleys are two landforms created by running rivers and erosion. A valley is a depressed area of land between mountains or hills, while a canyon is a deep and narrow valley having steep sides.

What is the difference between George and canyons?
--------------------------------------------------

A gorge has rocky, steep walls caused by natural factors like erosion. A canyon is a narrow deep valley formed by water erosion or tectonic activity.

What’s the difference between a valley and a canyon?
----------------------------------------------------

The main difference between Valley and Canyon is that the Valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it and Canyon is a deep ravine between cliffs. A valley is a low area between hills or mountains often with a river running through it. In geology, a valley or dale is a depression that is longer than it is wide.

Which is an example of a mountain canyon?
-----------------------------------------

Examples of mountain-type canyons are Provo Canyon in Utah or Yosemite Valley in California’s Sierra Nevada. Canyons within mountains, or gorges that have an opening on only one side, are called box canyons. Slot canyons are very narrow canyons that often have smooth walls.

Which is an example of a valley in the world?
---------------------------------------------

Valley is a generic term that applies to any depression between two cliffs or mountains. It usually contains a river. Indus Valley in Pakistan or Kashmir Valley in India is two very famous examples of valleys in the world.

How are submarine canyons different from regular canyons?
---------------------------------------------------------

Unlike canyons on land, submarine canyons are thought to be formed by turbidity currents and landslides. An elongated depression between hills or mountains, often with a river flowing through it.
