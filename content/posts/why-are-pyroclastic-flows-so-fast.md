Why are pyroclastic flows so fast?
----------------------------------

Pyroclastic flow speeds are so intense, they seem to defy the laws of physics, given the high static friction of volcanic particles. Now volcanic researchers have figured out how it works – those hot currents generate a layer of air at their base, over which they glide almost without friction.

Where and what is the largest active volcano?
---------------------------------------------

Rising gradually to more than 4 km (2.5 mi) above sea level, Hawaii’s Mauna Loa is the largest active volcano on our planet.

How dangerous are pyroclastic flows?
------------------------------------

Why a Pyroclastic Flow is so Dangerous. A pyroclastic flow is so dangerous because it moves so quickly it does not give anyone the opportunity to escape its potential effects. Furthermore it can move uphill as it is driven both by the power of the eruption and by the gravity force of the material behind it.

What are the dangers of the pyroclastic flow?
---------------------------------------------

 At a Glance Pyroclastic flows are a very dangerous phenomenon that occur during some volcanic eruptions. The speed of these flows, as well as the extremely high temperatures, make them almost impossible to escape. Many of the deaths in Sunday’s Volcano of Fire eruption in Guatemala were blamed on pyroclastic flows.

What are the characteristics and effects of a pyroclastic flow?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Pyroclastic flows vary considerably in size and speed, but even relatively small flows that move &lt;5 km from a volcano can destroy buildings, forests, and farmland. On the margins of pyroclastic flows, death and serious injury to people and animals may result from burns and inhalation of hot ash and gases.

Would pyroclastic flow kill you?
--------------------------------

Both its temperature and its chemical composition make pyroclastic flows deadly, especially because their velocity surpasses that of any regular land vehicle. If you have the misfortune to cross the path of a pyroclastic flow, the most likely outcome will be a quick, scorching death.
