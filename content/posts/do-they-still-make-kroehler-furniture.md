We generally encourage sellers to list used furniture at about 20 – 50% of the original retail price since furniture is very much like any other depreciable asset. One exception: pieces that are part of a unique or special collection because they tend to lose value once they’re taken from their retail location.

How can you tell if something is worth money?
---------------------------------------------

For most pieces, the value is determined by the rarity and the condition. If an item was mass produced, even if it has been billed as a collectible, it will be worth less than something that was produced in small quantities. Condition is also important. For most items, any imperfections will lessen the value.

How can I find out what my inherited furniture is worth?
--------------------------------------------------------

Take clear, well-lit photographs from all angles. Search the piece for any labels or maker’s marks. Write them down and take photos. Look to see if any previous repairs have been made to the piece (like a new screw replacing an old one). Write down any known provenance of the piece. Was it your grandfather’s? Did it come over on a ship during WWII?

Where can I get an appraiser for my furniture?
----------------------------------------------

Reputable auction houses and professional associations such as the American Society of Appraisers are useful resources. Hire someone who specializes in what you need to be appraised. You don’t want a furniture specialist assessing a coin collection. If the appraiser offers to sell your item, walk away; that’s a conflict of interest.

Is it OK to clean antique furniture before selling?
---------------------------------------------------

Don’t touch the furniture until you know its value. It can be tempting to want to spruce up your antique furniture before selling it or bringing it to the appraiser, but hands off! Until you know what you’re dealing with, any attempted repairs or cleaning could lower the value of your piece.
