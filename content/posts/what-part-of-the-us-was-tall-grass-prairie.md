What part of the US was tall grass prairie?
-------------------------------------------

Tallgrass prairie is a fire-dependent ecosystem distinguished by tall grasses (up to 10 feet tall), and deep, rich soils. Tallgrass prairie once covered parts of 14 states in the Midwest, including more than 80% of Iowa. Today, less than 0.1% of the original tallgrass prairie remains in Iowa.

Where is the largest remaining protected area of tall grass prairie in the world located?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve  
Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve at 39,650 acres is the largest protected piece of tallgrass prairie left on earth. Urban sprawl and conversion to cropland have left this once expansive landscape, originally spanning across 14 states from Texas to Minnesota, at less than 4% of its original size.

Where does prairie grass grow?
------------------------------

Prairies historically covered 170 million acres of North America. This sea of grass stretched from the Rocky Mountains to east of the Mississippi River and from Saskatchewan, south to Texas. It was the continent’s largest continuous ecosystem supporting an enormous quantity of plants and animals.

Which state has the most prairie?

What kind of grassland is found in South America?
-------------------------------------------------

Prairies are open grassland specially in South America. Prairies are ecosystems considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and a composition of grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type.

Why are the grasslands of the Great Plains not subject to erosion?
------------------------------------------------------------------

In spite of long recurrent droughts and occasional torrential rains, the grasslands of the Great Plains were not subject to great soil erosion. The root systems of native prairie grasses firmly held the soil in place to prevent run-off of soil.
