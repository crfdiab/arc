Did anyone die in the Pullman strike?
-------------------------------------

The US celebrates Labor Day because of a bloody clash over 100 years ago that left 30 people dead and cost $80 million in damages. Labor Day became a federal holiday in 1894, after the Pullman strike. The bloody strike led to 30 deaths and millions of dollars in damage.

How many people were at Pullman strike?
---------------------------------------

Responding to layoffs, wage cuts, and firings, workers at Pullman Palace Car Company in Chicago went on strike, and, eventually, some 125,000–250,000 railroad workers in 27 states joined their cause, stifling the national rail network west of Chicago.

What was the end result of the Pullman strike?
----------------------------------------------

Railway companies started to hire nonunion workers to restart business. By the time the strike ended, it had cost the railroads millions of dollars in lost revenue and in looted and damaged property. Striking workers had lost more than $1 million in wages.

What was the result of the great railroad strike of 1877?
---------------------------------------------------------

The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 was the country’s first major rail strike and witnessed the first general strike in the nation’s history. The strikes and the violence it spawned briefly paralyzed the country’s commerce and led governors in ten states to mobilize 60,000 militia members to reopen rail traffic.

Why did the Pullman strike fail?
--------------------------------

Among the reasons for the strike were the absence of democracy within the town of Pullman and its politics, the rigid paternalistic control of the workers by the company, excessive water and gas rates, and a refusal by the company to allow workers to buy and own houses. They had not yet formed a union.

Why did the Martinsburg strike eventually end peacefully?
---------------------------------------------------------

The strike on both sides of the river was ended after the governor appealed for help and gained the intervention of some 3,000 federal troops and 5,000 deputized special police. These armed forces killed at least eighteen people in skirmishes around the city.
