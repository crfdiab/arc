What are the top 10 countries that use biomass?
-----------------------------------------------

Almost 75% of the world’s biomass power capacity can be attributed to the United States, Brazil, China, Germany, Austria, Sweden, India, Italy, UK and Finland.

What is the most widely used biomass?
-------------------------------------

The most common biomass materials used for energy are plants, wood, and waste.

How much of the world uses biomass?
-----------------------------------

The world production of biomass is estimated at 146 billion metric tons a year, mostly wild plant growth. Biomass accounts for 35% of primary energy consumption in developing countries, raising the world total to 14% of primary energy consumption.

What country uses biomass the most 2020?
----------------------------------------

20 Countries Turning Waste And Biomass Into Energy

<table><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Country</th><th>Biomass and Combustible Waste as Percentage of Energy Supply</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Ethiopia</td><td>92.9%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>DR Congo</td><td>92.2%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Tanzania</td><td>85.0%</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Nigeria</td><td>81.5%</td></tr></table>

Does biomass pollute the air?
-----------------------------

Outside of contributing carbon dioxide emissions, burning biomass in a solid, liquid, or gaseous state can also emit other pollutants and particulate matter into the air, including carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and nitrogen oxides.

Who invented biomass?
---------------------

Jens Dall Bentzen  
A biomass system created by Danish inventor Jens Dall Bentzen greatly increases the types of biomass fuels that can be used, while further reducing associated emissions and increasing overall energy efficiency.

What is the best biomass fuel?
------------------------------

Wood wastes of all types make excellent biomass fuels and can be used in a wide variety of biomass technologies. Combustion of woody fuels to generate steam or electricity is a proven technology and is the most common biomass-to-energy process.

What advantages does biomass have?
----------------------------------

Some of the advantages of biomass energy are:

- Biomass is always and widely available as a renewable source of energy.
- It is carbon neutral.
- It reduces the overreliance of fossil fuels.
- Is less expensive than fossil fuels.
- Biomass production adds a revenue source for manufacturers.
- Less garbage in landfills.

What countries are 100 green?
-----------------------------

Albania, Iceland, and Paraguay obtain essentially all of their electricity from renewable sources (Albania and Paraguay 100% from hydroelectricity, Iceland 72% hydro and 28% geothermal). Norway obtains nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources (97 percent from hydropower).

Why biomass is bad?
-------------------

“Biomass is far from “clean” – burning biomass creates air pollution that causes a sweeping array of health harms, from asthma attacks to cancer to heart attacks, resulting in emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and premature deaths.”

What are the disadvantages of using biomass?
--------------------------------------------

While the advantages of biomass energy are plenty, there are also some shortcomings, including:

- Biomass energy is not as efficient as fossil fuels. Some biofuels, like Ethanol, is relatively inefficient as compared to gasoline.
- It is not entirely clean.
- Can lead to deforestation.
- Biomass plants require a lot of space.

How is biomass energy used in developing countries?
---------------------------------------------------

Because biomass energy requires very little processing, it is accessible to people who don’t have means of utilizing other forms of energy, such as nuclear or fossil fuels. However, many developing countries supplement biomass fuel with renewable energy in the form of solar energy; you don’t need an energy grid for solar energy.

Which is country burn the most biomass for energy?
--------------------------------------------------

Which Countries Burn the Most Biomass? Some of the countries that burn the most biomass for energy include Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Nigeria, and Haiti.

Why is Finland the largest biomass plant in the world?
------------------------------------------------------

Another reason why Finland leads the ranking of the world’s five largest biomass plants is because the country was until a few years ago energetically dependent on other countries. Since 2010, Finland’s energy self-sufficiency has been sought, focusing on renewable energies.

What kind of biomass is used in the UK?
---------------------------------------

Animal husbandry residues, such as poultry litter, are common in the UK. Wiki Info: There is research involving algae or algae-derived biomass, as this non-food resource can be produced at rates five to ten times those of other types of land-based agriculture, such as corn and soy.
