What did the Celts call Scotland?
---------------------------------

The Picts survived as a group until early in the 10th century. There is no record of their dying out or migrating to other places. It is likely that the Picts simply developed into a multi-ethnic nation of Scotti, Picts, Britons, and Angles, which we now call Scotland.

What were Celtic Warriors called?
---------------------------------

The Celtic warriors, or Gauls as they were called in the French part of their range, spiked their hair up with lime and wore horned and winged helmets to emphasize their large stature. Their attacks on the battlefield were fearless, wild and savage, but they were also skilled and deadly.

What did the Romans call the British Isles?
-------------------------------------------

The post-conquest Romans used Britannia or Britannia Magna (Large Britain) for Britain and Hibernia or Britannia Parva (Small Britain) for Ireland.

What language did the Celts bring to the British Isles?
-------------------------------------------------------

The Britons spoke an Insular Celtic language known as Common Brittonic. Brittonic was spoken throughout the island of Britain (in modern terms, England, Wales and Scotland), as well as offshore islands such as the Isle of Man, Isles of Scilly, Orkney, Hebrides, Isle of Wight and Shetland.

Why did the Normans call Ireland the Emerald Isle?
--------------------------------------------------

He argued that the fashion for styling it a ‘Norman’ conquest goes back only to the 19th century. Colin Veach agreed, stating that the term ‘Normans’ in Irish history came from a wish to associate the island’s story with wider European history.

Why was Ireland so important to the Celts?
------------------------------------------

The famed Asterix comic strip gives an amusing indication of what the Gaulish contingent of Celts felt about the Romans. Ireland (never conquered by the Romans) became another stronghold, and so did the bits of Britain nobody else much wanted.

When did the Normans first come to Ireland?
-------------------------------------------

If ‘the Normans’ who first arrived in Ireland in 1169, were not ‘English’ and became ‘more Irish than the Irish themselves’, then the contradiction in Irish historical memory is ironed out a little. Normans or English? The tomb of Richard de Clare or ‘Strongbow’ in Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin.

Where did the Celtic gods live in Britain?
------------------------------------------

Ireland (never conquered by the Romans) became another stronghold, and so did the bits of Britain nobody else much wanted. Wales, for example. They also infiltrated the Orkneys, Baleiric Islands, bits of Scandinavia and the Caucasus.
