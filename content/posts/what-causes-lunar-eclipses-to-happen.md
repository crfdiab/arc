What causes lunar eclipses to happen?
-------------------------------------

Lunar eclipses occur when Earth’s shadow blocks the sun’s light, which otherwise reflects off the moon. There are three types — total, partial and penumbral — with the most dramatic being a total lunar eclipse, in which Earth’s shadow completely covers the moon.

How often does lunar eclipse occur?
-----------------------------------

twice every three years  
On average, a total lunar eclipse will happen a bit more frequently than twice every three years. Every three and a half years, two total lunar eclipses will happen within the same year. Every 200 years, three total lunar eclipses happen in the same year.

What makes it possible for a lunar eclipse to occur?
----------------------------------------------------

The primary condition required for a lunar eclipse to occur is that the sun, the earth, and the moon should be exactly or very closely aligned, with the earth being positioned between the other two. This blocks the light of the sun from reaching the moon’s surface, thereby casting its shadow on the moon and causing a lunar eclipse.

Why does a full moon look reddish during a lunar eclipse?
---------------------------------------------------------

During a lunar eclipse, Earth gets in the way of the sun’s light hitting the moon. That means that during the night, a full moon fades away as Earth’s shadow covers it up. The moon can also look reddish because Earth’s atmosphere absorbs the other colors while it bends some sunlight toward the moon.

Why are people afraid of the lunar eclipse?
-------------------------------------------

It was believed that a Lunar Eclipse would bring a rise of darkness and that evil would flourish. These beliefs have created superstitions around Lunar Eclipses, some of which are still observed today. Many cultures believe that pregnant women should not go outside on an Eclipse for fear of miscarriage.

Why does the Moon turn orange during a lunar eclipse?
-----------------------------------------------------

Sunlight bending through the atmosphere and absorbing other colors is also why sunsets are orange and red. During a total lunar eclipse, the moon is shining from all the sunrises and sunsets occurring on Earth! Note: This diagram is not to scale. The moon appears orange-red in a total lunar eclipse on October 27, 2004.
