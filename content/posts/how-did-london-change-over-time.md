How did London change over time?
--------------------------------

London has undergone enormous changes over the last 50 years. As the graph shows, the population fell from 8.5 million in 1939 to 6.9 million in 1981 and rose to 8.1 million in 2011. As a result, the population of both inner and outer London has risen.

What led to the development of London?
--------------------------------------

Roman London (AD 47–410) Londinium was established as a civilian town by the Romans about four years after the invasion of AD 43. London, like Rome, was founded on the point of the river where it was narrow enough to bridge and the strategic location of the city provided easy access to much of Europe.

What are the main reasons for London changing so much during the 1800s?

Housing. London’s great expansion in the 19th Century was driven by housing growth to accommodate the rapidly expanding population of the city.

How and why did London grow?
----------------------------

In addition to the port, London also grew because of the founding of the Bank of England. One of the first bank and most successful in the world. In the years from 1750 to 1900 the population increased from 600’000 to 4’500’000 people, due to the Industrial Revolution in this time.

Why did the name change from Londinium to London?
-------------------------------------------------

The name of London is derived from a word first attested, in Latinised form, as Londinium. There is a long history of mythicising etymologies, such as the twelfth-century Historia Regum Britanniae asserting that the city’s name is derived from the name of King Lud who once controlled the city.

What are the pull factors of London?
------------------------------------

The main pull factors come as a result of the specialisation of the capital in high value sectors, its openness to trade, and its development over time as a business destination. Over time, London’s status as a global city has developed as a result of its central location.

--------------------------------------------------

The 19 th Century was a time of great change for Britain, and especially its capital of London.

How did the Great Fire of London change the city?
-------------------------------------------------

Later, close to Pudding Lane, a monument was built so that people would not forget the fire. It was the work of Sir Christopher Wren, who designed many new buildings, including St Pauls Cathedral, when the city was rebuilt after the fire. This lesson can be used with pupils at key stage 1 for the history national curriculum in year 2.

Why did the population of London change during the Industrial Revolution?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

These changes in population are the result of the changes in the economic structure of London. For example, as the docks closed, manufacturing was lost, particularly in the Lea Valley. This led to many job losses in inner London and migration out of the city, resulting in a loss of population in inner London.
