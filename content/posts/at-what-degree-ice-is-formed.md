At what degree ice is formed?
-----------------------------

32 degrees Fahrenheit  
The freezing point for water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). When the temperature of water falls to 0 degrees Celsius and below, it begins to change to ice.

What causes ice formation?
--------------------------

When it gets too cold, the air condenses, creating liquid. And when the liquid continues to get colder, it freezes. Inadequate airflow prevents your AC system from moving the cool air through your home, leading to a buildup of ice.

How was ice formed on Earth?
----------------------------

Ice formation, any mass of ice that occurs on the Earth’s continents or surface waters. Such masses form wherever substantial amounts of liquid water freeze and remain in the solid state for some period of time. Sea ice consists of frozen saltwater that has been broken up and jammed together by wind.

How long does it take for ice to form?
--------------------------------------

In most situations, ice made in a standard ice tray — those plastic models with space for a dozen tapered cubes — takes about three to four hours to freeze in your home freezer.

Can ice be wet?
---------------

In 1842, the British physicist Michael Faraday observed that ice is always wet and forms a thin layer of liquid water. In a cooled sample chamber, they observed the surface of water ice both in water vapor of saturated air, at equilibrium, and in dry air.

How do I stop my air conditioner from ice forming?
--------------------------------------------------

The best way to prevent ice build up on your air conditioner is by regularly changing your filter and keeping it clean. If your furnace filter is clean, there is a chance that your evaporator coil may be clogged with dirt, hair ect. If you have never had this cleaned in the past, it may be time.

Why my AC is freezing up?
-------------------------

Air conditioners are full of moving parts that can get stuck, broken, or clogged. Refrigerant lines can kink, fans can stop moving, filters can become clogged, and things can leak. A too-low level of refrigerant is also known to cause freezing up.

Did dinosaurs or ice age came first?
------------------------------------

The ice age happened after the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs died out prior to the Pleistocene age, which was the last of five ice ages that spanned…

What caused ice age 12000 years ago?
------------------------------------

Key points: The last ice age was 12,000 years ago. The onset of an ice age is related to changes in the Earth’s tilt and orbit. The Earth is due for another ice age now but climate change makes it very unlikely.

What age is ice Cube?
---------------------

52 years (June 15, 1969)  
Ice Cube/Age

How much weight can ice hold?
-----------------------------

At 4” the ice is suitable for ice fishing, cross-country skiing and walking and can support about 200 pounds. At 5 inches of new clear ice should be enough to hold a single snowmobile or ATV or about 800 pounds. At 8-12 inches the ice should be suitable for a small car or a larger group of people.

How does the ice form in a glacier?
-----------------------------------

The formation of the ice of a glacier begins with snow deposition. Snow, with its star or hexagon shaped crystals, contains a great quantity of air, and has a very low density (this is why we sink in so easily, furthermore because of this, snow has a great capacity to absorb sounds, a snowy landscape seems strangely “silent”).

Where does ice occur in the Solar System?
-----------------------------------------

Ice / aɪs / is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color. In the Solar System, ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as close to the Sun as Mercury to as far away as the Oort cloud objects.

When does the Arctic sea ice form in the winter?
------------------------------------------------

During the winter months – when the poles are coldest and darkest – the water on the ocean surface starts to form tiny ice crystals. These crystals get pushed together by waves and currents, forming chunks of ice that freeze together. In the north, Arctic sea ice usually covers the greatest area in March.

Why is it important to study the formation of ice?
--------------------------------------------------

The study of these impurities enables us to obtain important information about the formation processes and about where the ice comes from and even about the composition and temperature of the atmosphere at the time of ice formation. The formation of the ice of a glacier begins with snow deposition.
