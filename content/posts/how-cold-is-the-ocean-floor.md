How cold is the ocean floor?
----------------------------

The temperature range extends from 30 °C (86 °F) at the sea surface to −1 °C (30.2 °F) at the seabed. Like salinity, the temperature at depth is determined by the conditions that the water encountered when it was last at the surface. In the low latitudes the temperature change from top to bottom in the oceans is large.

How cold is the Pacific Ocean water?
------------------------------------

The water temperature right now is at least 49°F and at most 88°F. The seasonal average water temperature is between 49°F and 87°F (see water temperatures of the Pacific Ocean in august).

What is the water temp at the bottom of the ocean?
--------------------------------------------------

90 % of the total volume of ocean is found below the thermocline in the deep ocean. The deep ocean is not well mixed. The deep ocean is made up of horizontal layers of equal density. Much of this deep ocean water is between 0-3 degrees Celsius (32-37.5 degrees Fahrenheit)!

What’s the average temperature of the Pacific Ocean?
----------------------------------------------------

No one temp can be used to describe the temperature of the Pacific Ocean. That depends a lot on where you are and when you are there. At the surface: In the tropics, it can be 28–32 degrees C (82–90 degrees F). Nearer the poles, it can get down to approximately freezing (0 C, 32 F), particularly in the winter.

Are there still cold waters in the Pacific Ocean?

Is the Pacific Ocean the deepest ocean in the world?
----------------------------------------------------

The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth ‘s oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. At 165,250,000 square kilometers…

How is the temperature and salinity of the ocean determined?
------------------------------------------------------------

The oceans tend to be stratified, the principal factor being temperature; the bottom waters of the deep parts are intensely cold, with temperatures only slightly above freezing. The surface zone, where temperature variations are perceptible, is between 330 and 1,000 feet (100 and 300 metres) thick.
