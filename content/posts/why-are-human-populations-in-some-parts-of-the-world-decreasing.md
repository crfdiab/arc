Why are human populations in some parts of the world decreasing?
----------------------------------------------------------------

A reduction over time in a region’s population can be caused by sudden adverse events such as outbursts of infectious disease, famine, and war or by long-term trends, for example sub-replacement fertility, persistently low birth rates, high mortality rates, and continued emigration.

Where in the world is the human population growth rate decreasing?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally, developed nations have seen a decline in their growth rates in recent decades, though annual growth rates remain above 2% in poverty-stricken countries of the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, and also in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.

What factors are causing the rate of world population growth to fall?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Often economic growth and economic development have led to a decline in population growth, but there are no hard and fast rules and other factors, such as availability of family planning, social expectations and government intervention can play an important role.

Is the human population increasing or decreasing each day?
----------------------------------------------------------

The only notable decline of the human population since the invention of farming was during the Black Death epidemic. During world wars human population was still increasing. Currently, there is 360,000 births per day and 150 000 people die each day. So each day there is around 210 000 additional humans.

Which is the area with the highest rate of population decline?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The size and demographics of the population change when: families with children move to larger towns and cities; young and better-educated people move to larger towns and cities. The areas with the highest rates of population decline are Zeeland Flanders, southern Limburg and northern and eastern Groningen.

Why is the population of the world going to shrink?
---------------------------------------------------

As women have better access to education and contraception, the world’s population is forecasted to shrink, researchers say. Researchers said that these “dramatic declines” in working-age populations in countries such as India and China, will both obstruct economic growth and lead to shifts in global powers.

What is the ultimate goal of population reduction?
--------------------------------------------------

The ultimate goal of population reduction and control is to achieve mass transhumanism — the merging of humans with sophisticated technologies that greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.
