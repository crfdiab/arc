Is Dotsero a supervolcano?
--------------------------

THE ANSWER. Yes. The Dotsero volcano, in western Eagle County, is Colorado’s only active volcano. The volcano last erupted 4,200 years ago, but a 2018 report from the United States Geological Survey lists it as a moderate threat to human activity.

How was Dotsero volcano formed?
-------------------------------

Dotsero Crater formed when magma encountered water and explosively blasted a crater through the country rock, destroying part of the scoria-cone chain and showering tephra across the landscape. This tephra fallout includes a substantial amount of red sandstone bedrock fragments.

Can Dotsero erupt again?
------------------------

Though much of Colorado’s landscape was shaped by volcanic activity, only one volcano remains active in the Centennial State – Dotsero volcano. It’s technically dormant at the moment, but it could erupt again.

Is the Dotsero volcano in Colorado still active?
------------------------------------------------

Not for a very, very, very long time. However, it is still considered an active volcano. Colorado’s Dotsero volcano is a sprawling indentation in the mountains just northeast of the unincorporated community of Dotsero in Eagle County off Interstate 70.

How big is the crater of the Dotsero volcano?
---------------------------------------------

The Dotsero volcano crater is about 250 feet deep at low-rim points and about 2,460 feet wide, according to the USGS, though when it erupted it was likely wider and deeper.

Why was Dotsero volcano able to pop twice?
------------------------------------------

“Dotsero is kind of an anomaly, we don’t really know why it exists where it exists.” Busch said most of Colorado’s volcanic activity ceased about 27 to 30 million years ago, so how Dotsero was able to pop twice in the last 6,000 years is a bit of a mystery.

What was the biggest industry in Dotsero Colorado?
--------------------------------------------------

Before the railroads were constructed, the community of Dotsero’s largest industry was making cinderblocks from the volcano. While making cinderblocks is nothing to scoff at, the area’s big money maker came during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as Dotsero was an important hub for the now defunct Denver &amp; Salt Lake Railway.
