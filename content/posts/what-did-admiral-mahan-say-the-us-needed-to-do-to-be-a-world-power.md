What did Admiral Mahan say the US needed to do to be a world power?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Alfred Mahan was a naval officer who studied large empires and found that empires such as Great Britain would not have gained there strength without the navy. He thought navy wasn’t just important for trade but also for the U.S. as a world power and an empire.

Why did Mahan say the US needed to expand?
------------------------------------------

Mahan believed that the United States could follow the same guidelines and emerge as a world power.

In addition, an isthmian canal was needed in the Western Hemisphere to shorten trade distances.

Mahan believed that the U.S. economy would soon be unable to absorb the massive amounts of industrial and commercial goods being produced domestically, and he argued that the United States should seek new markets abroad.

Why is the Navy important in time of war?
-----------------------------------------

This protection in time of war must be extended by armed shipping. The necessity of a navy, in the restricted sense of the word, springs, therefore, from the existence of a peaceful shipping, and disappears with it, except in the case of a nation which has aggressive tendencies, and keeps up a navy merely as a branch of the military establishment.

-----------------------------------------
