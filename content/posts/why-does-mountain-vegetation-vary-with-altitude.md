Why does mountain vegetation vary with altitude?
------------------------------------------------

Mountain vegetation is found on the mountains at higher altitudes (heights). As the height increases, the temperature decreases. Thus, trees at a higher altitude are conical and form the coniferous forests.

How does altitude affect natural vegetation?
--------------------------------------------

Altitude affects the amount of sunlight and water that plant receives. At high altitudes, short-wave radiation is seen. Not all plants can survive this type of sunlight. Plants growing at high altitude typically receive a lot of rainfall, which trickles down a mountain in the form of streams or rivers.

Why is there less vegetation at higher altitudes?
-------------------------------------------------

An increase in altitude affects the climate which affects the vegetation and soils. As the altitude increased on Mount Taranaki the vegetation becomes low shrubs compared to dense large forest trees. This is a result of altitudinal zones and the environmental interaction between temperature, soil compositions â€¦

What factors vary with altitude?
--------------------------------

Factors

- Temperature. Decreasing air temperature usually coincides with increasing elevation, which directly influences the length the growing season at different elevations of the mountain.
- Humidity.
- Soil composition.
- Biological forces.
- Solar radiation.
- Massenerhebung effect.
- Other factors.
- Treeline.

Why are there different types of mountain vegetation?
-----------------------------------------------------

Each belt of mountain vegetation includes several different plant communities because of the variety of local conditions related to the dissection of relief, degree of weathering of surface rocks, and variation in the physical and chemical composition of surface rocks.

How does elevation affect the growth of vegetation?
---------------------------------------------------

Their findings indicate that even the slightest change in elevation can yield significant differences in the kinds and health of vegetation in the area. Climate plays a large role in what types of vegetation can grow in a certain area. In higher altitudes, the wind and coldness become a large factor in vegetation development.

How does the light affect the vegetation of a mountain?
-------------------------------------------------------

Light conditions, in particular, vary in different ways. The elevation boundaries of particular belts of mountain vegetation depend on the geographic latitude, exposure of the slopes, and other conditions.
