When was the last time a tornado was rated a F5?

For United States tornadoes as of February 1, 2007, the Fujita scale has been recalibrated to more accurately match tornado speeds with their damage and to augment and refine damage descriptors.

Since the implementation of the Enhanced Fujita scale on February 1, 2007, there have been nine officially rated EF5 tornadoes in the United States from May 4th, 2007-May 20th, 2013 to date, while previously fifty tornadoes were officially rated F5 on the original Fujita scale from May 11th, 1953-May 3rd, 1999.
