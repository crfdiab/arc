What main ideas came from the English Bill of Rights?
-----------------------------------------------------

The English Bill of Rights created a constitutional monarchy in England, meaning the king or queen acts as head of state but his or her powers are limited by law. Under this system, the monarchy couldn’t rule without the consent of Parliament, and the people were given individual rights.

What ideas are contained in the Bill of Rights?
-----------------------------------------------

The entire Bill of Rights was created to protect rights the original citizens believed were naturally theirs, including:

- Freedom of Religion.
- Freedom of Speech, Press, Petition, and Assembly.
- Privacy.
- Due Process of Law.
- Equality Before the Law. What are three Enlightenment ideas used in the declaration of Independence?
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Core Enlightenment ideals used in the Declaration of Independence include the idea that all people are entitled to certain rights just by virtue of being human, the belief that a government’s legitimacy comes from the consent of the governed, and the idea that a government’s main purpose is to protect the rights of the people.
