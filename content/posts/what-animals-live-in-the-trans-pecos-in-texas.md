    50 states. Alaska is the most biodiverse state with 15 ecoregions across 3 biomes in the same realm. California comes in a close second with 13 ecoregions across 4 biomes in the same realm.
    
    Is Texas an ecosystem?
    ----------------------
    
    Texas ecosystems range from dry deserts to swampy wetlands. On the Texas geography map, eastern Texas is primarily wetlands and forests, while northern and central Texas features prairie grasslands. One of the largest desert ecosystems in the world, the Chihuahuan Desert, dominates the landscape in western Texas.
    
    What kind of ecosystem is the Trans Pecos?
    ------------------------------------------
    
    Like other ecosystems, the Trans-Pecos region is dynamic and has experienced gradual shifts in climate and vegetation. For example, there is strong paleoecological evidence that much of the Trans-Pecos region was once covered, approximately 11,000 years ago, by a mesic woodland (Van Devender, 1995).
