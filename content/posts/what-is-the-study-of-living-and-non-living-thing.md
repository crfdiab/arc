What is the study of living and non living thing?
-------------------------------------------------

Ecology is the study of living things and nonliving things which I think.

What are the living and nonliving things in an environment?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Nonliving things do not grow, need food, or reproduce. Some examples of important nonliving things in an ecosystem are sunlight, water, air, wind, and rocks. Living things grow, change, produce waste, reproduce, and die. Some examples of living things are organisms such as plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria.

What is the study of living things in the environment?
------------------------------------------------------

Ecology is the study of the relationships between living organisms, including humans, and their physical environment; it seeks to understand the vital connections between plants and animals and the world around them.

How are living and nonliving things in the environment related?
---------------------------------------------------------------

All the parts of an environment work together. Every living thing in an environment depends in some way upon other living and nonliving things in the environment. But how? Non â€“ living things make up the physical environment. That means sunlight, water, soil, temperature, and rainfall help to form the environment.

Which is a nonliving part of a lake?
------------------------------------

Sunlight, water, and soil are some of the nonliving parts of a lake. All the parts of an environment work together. Every living thing in an environment depends in some way upon other living and nonliving things in the environment.

How are living things able to survive in an ecosystem?
------------------------------------------------------

All organisms exist within ecosystems. Living things have various structures that enable them to survive: for example, transport structures in plants allow water and trace elements to move.

How are organisms related to the physical environment?
------------------------------------------------------

This focus idea is explored through: Students tend to think of organisms as being only animals that interact with the physical environment and plants, without appreciating the complex interdependence between members of and across species.
