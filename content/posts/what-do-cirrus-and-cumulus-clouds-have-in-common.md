What do cirrus and cumulus clouds have in common?
-------------------------------------------------

Cirrus clouds are the most common of the high clouds. They are composed of ice and are thin, wispy clouds blown in high winds into long streamers. Cirrus clouds are usually white and predict fair to pleasant weather….

How are cumulus and stratus clouds the same?
--------------------------------------------

STRATUS. Two main classifications of clouds are cumulus and stratus. Cumulus clouds result from air rising due to positive buoyancy (i.e. metaphor: bubbles rising in a pot of water). Stratus clouds results from a forced lifting of air (low level convergence, upper level divergence).

What are the main characteristics of cirrus cumulus and stratus clouds?

Types of Clouds for Kids

- Cirrus Clouds. Cirrus clouds are the thin, wispy clouds seen high in the sky.
- Cumulus Clouds. Cumulus clouds are the puffy clouds that are usually scattered throughout the sky.
- Stratus Clouds. Stratus clouds look like a huge thick blanket covering the sky.
- Nimbus Clouds.

What do all clouds have in common?
----------------------------------

All clouds are made up of basically the same thing: water droplets or ice crystals that float in the sky. But all clouds look a little bit different from one another, and sometimes these differences can help us predict a change in the weather.

What’s the difference between cumulus and cirrus?
-------------------------------------------------

Cirrus clouds are wispy, veil-like clouds that form in the upper troposphere, while cumulus clouds are stacked, dense and fluffy, and they form much closer to the ground. If you’re spending an afternoon looking for shapes in the clouds, you’re probably watching cumulus clouds. Those are cirrus clouds.

Do cirrus clouds bring rain?
----------------------------

What weather is associated with cirrus clouds? They often form in advance of a warm front, where the air masses meet at high levels, indicating a change in the weather is on the way. Technically these clouds produce precipitation but it never reaches the ground.

What is the difference between cirrus and cumulus clouds?
---------------------------------------------------------

Cirrus clouds are wispy, veil-like clouds that form in the upper troposphere, while cumulus clouds are stacked, dense and fluffy, and they form much closer to the ground.

What weather do cirrus clouds bring?
------------------------------------

Cirrus clouds – thin, wispy clouds strewn across the sky in high winds. A few cirrus clouds may indicate fair weather, but increasing cover indicates a change of weather (an approaching warm front) will occur within 24 hours. These are the most abundant of all high-level clouds.

What’s the difference between cirrus clouds and stratus clouds?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Cirrus clouds are wispy, feathery, and composed entirely of ice crystals. They often are the first sign of an approaching warm front or upper-level jet streak. Unlike cirrus, cirrostratus clouds form more of a widespread, veil-like layer (similar to what stratus clouds do in low levels).

What’s the difference between a cumulus and a Stratus?
------------------------------------------------------

stratus are zero stable and fluffy, flat on top and bottom, medium thick. high or low altitude. cumulus are stable and fluffy, flat on bottom bumpy on top, medium thick. low or medium altitude. cumulonimbus are growing and tumultuous, flat on bottom, flat on top and blown sideways by upper winds, grows extremely tall, 10 miles or so.

What’s the difference between a Cirrus and a cumulus?
-----------------------------------------------------

cumulus are stable and fluffy, flat on bottom bumpy on top, medium thick. low or medium altitude. cumulonimbus are growing and tumultuous, flat on bottom, flat on top and blown sideways by upper winds, grows extremely tall, 10 miles or so. cirrus are stable and long and stringy, thin and flat, but very high.

Which is the best description of a stratocumulus cloud?
-------------------------------------------------------

Stratocumulus clouds are hybrids of layered stratus and cellular cumulus, i.e., individual cloud elements, characteristic of cumulo type clouds, clumped together in a continuous distribution, characteristic of strato type clouds. Stratocumulus also can be thought of as a layer of cloud clumps with thick and thin areas.
