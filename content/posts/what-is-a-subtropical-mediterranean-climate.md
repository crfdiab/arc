What is a subtropical Mediterranean climate?
--------------------------------------------

The Mediterranean climate is a subtropical climate with a wet season in winter and a dry season in the summer. Regions with this type of climate include the rim lands of the Mediterranean Sea, southwestern Australia, parts of the west coast of South America around Santiago, the coastal areas of southern North America.

Are Mediterranean climates humid?
---------------------------------

Mediterranean climates also tend to be drier than humid subtropical ones, with precipitation totals ranging from 35 to 90 cm (14 to 35 inches); the lowest amounts occur in interior regions adjacent to the semiarid steppe climates.

What are three characteristics of humid subtropical climates?
-------------------------------------------------------------

In a humid subtropical climate, summers are typically long, hot and humid. Monthly mean summer temperatures are normally between 24 and 27 °C (75 and 81 °F). A deep current of tropical air dominates the humid subtropics at the time of high sun, and daily intense (but brief) convective thundershowers are common.

What are the characteristics of Mediterranean climate?
------------------------------------------------------

The concept of Mediterranean climate is characterized by mild wet winters and warm to hot, dry summers and occur on the west side of continents between about 30° and 40° latitude. However, the presence of a relatively large mass of water is unique to the actual Mediterranean region.

What are characteristics of a humid subtropical climate?
--------------------------------------------------------

Humid subtropical climate, major climate type of the Köppen classification characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. This climate type is found on the eastern sides of the continents between 20° and 35° N and S latitude.

What are the characteristics of a humid subtropical climate?
------------------------------------------------------------

A humid subtropical climate is a zone of climate characterized by hot and humid summers, and cool to mild winters. These climates normally lie on the southeast side of all continents, generally between latitudes 25° and 35° and are located poleward from adjacent tropical climates.

What kind of climate does the Mediterranean region have?
--------------------------------------------------------

In the Mediterranean climate, the summers are dryer than the winters. Additionally, the Mediterranean climate stays dryer throughout the year compared to the humid subtropical climate. For this reason, Mediterranean climates are sometimes called “dry subtropical climates.”.

What is the difference between tropical and semi-moist climates?
----------------------------------------------------------------

According to the degree of moistening in the subtropical belt of each continent, the following subzones are distinguished: 1 Arid (Mediterranean) climate with maximum precipitation in winter and mild summer. 2 Dry subtropics with low average annual precipitation. 3 Semi-moist subtropics. 4 Wet subtropics.

Is there a dry summer in the Mediterranean?
-------------------------------------------

The exception is the Asian humid subtropical zone, where the monsoon influence results in dry winters. Precipitation is both less and more strikingly seasonal in Mediterranean climates, which receive the vast majority of their rainfall in winter and experience very dry summers.
