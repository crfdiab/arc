How did the eruption of Thera affect Greek history?
---------------------------------------------------

Satellite image of Thera, November 21, 2000. The bay in the center of the island is the caldera created by the Minoan eruption. It destroyed the Minoan settlement at Akrotiri, as well as communities and agricultural areas on nearby islands and the coast of Crete with subsequent earthquakes and tsunamis. …

How did the eruption of Thera change the world?
-----------------------------------------------

That fiery explosion killed upwards of 40,000 people in just a few hours, produced colossal tsunamis 40 feet tall, spewed volcanic ash across Asia, and caused a drop in global temperatures and created strangely colored sunsets for three years. The blast was heard 3,000 miles away.

What was caused by the blast of the volcano that affected much of the Aegean coastline?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Around 1600 B.C., with the explosion of the volcano Santorini, in the Aegean Sea, the collapse of the caldera caused a devastating tsunami, with waves about 50 metres high, which spread throughout much of the eastern Mediterranean, also affecting Turkey, Syria, Egypt and Palestine which were devastated by the waves.

How did the eruption of Thera affect the Bronze Age?
----------------------------------------------------

Map of the Aegean Bronze Age The cataclysmic eruption of Thera split the island into three smaller ones, the largest of which (Santorini) forms a crescent surrounding a large caldera. Just as in the eruption of Pompeii, volcanic ash buried and preserved Akrotiri.

How did the eruption of Thera affect Santorini?
-----------------------------------------------

An absence of human remains and valuables like metal suggest that the Minoan residents of Santorini predicted the eruption and the island was evacuated, but the culture as a whole did not fare as well. Based on the nearby island of Crete, the powerful Minoan civilization declined suddenly soon after Thera blew its top.

Where was the volcano that erupted in the Bronze Age?
-----------------------------------------------------

See Article History. Eruption of Thera, devastating Bronze Age eruption of a long-dormant volcano on the Aegean island of Thera, about 70 miles (110 km) north of Crete.

How is the Thera eruption related to the Minoan eruption?
---------------------------------------------------------

If the Thera eruption could be associated with a given layer of Cretan (or other) culture, chronologists could use the date of that layer to date the eruption itself. Since Thera’s culture at the time of destruction was similar to the Late Minoan IA (LMIA) culture on Crete, LMIA is the baseline to establish chronology elsewhere.
