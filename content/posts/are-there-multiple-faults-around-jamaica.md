Are there multiple faults around Jamaica?
-----------------------------------------

Jamaica itself is traversed by a number of geological faults that feature Quaternary left-lateral offsets. In eastern Jamaica there is the Plantain Garden fault that runs into the Yallahs, Blue Mountain, Wagwater and Silver Hill faults, which together control the tectonics of the Blue Mountain block.

Why Jamaica has had major earthquakes in its history?
-----------------------------------------------------

The Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) states that Jamaica is located along the “northern margin of the Caribbean Plate” and that “the presence of very active faults on the island makes Jamaica very vulnerable to earthquakes.” The erratic nature of earthquakes means that they strike …

Is Jamaica in an earthquake zone?
---------------------------------

It defines the northern boundary of the Caribbean plate and the Gonave microplate. It often dominates the seismicity of Jamaica during local quiet periods. Strong earthquakes originating from the Oriente Fracture Zone have been felt on the island of Jamaica.

Is Jamaica prone to tsunamis?
-----------------------------

In a total of 2 tidal waves classified as a tsunami since 1692 a total of 2,000 people died in Jamaica. Tsunamis therefore occur only rarely here. The strongest tidal wave registered in Jamaica so far reached a height of 2.5 meters.

Is the fault line in Jamaica and Haiti the same?
------------------------------------------------

Jamaica Shares Same Earthquake Faultline as Haiti. Jamaica shares the same fault line (a crack or break in the earth’s surface) with Haiti, which suffered a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake on January 11.

Where is the strike slip fault in Jamaica?
------------------------------------------

The OFZ, spanning a distance of over 1000 kilometres, from south of Grand Cayman to the north coast of Haiti, is known to be a left-lateral strike-slip fault which means there is a relative westerly drift of Cuba (on the North American Plate) with respect to Jamaica.

Where did the earthquake in Jamaica take place?
-----------------------------------------------

Earthquakes in Jamaica. Measurements made using Global Positioning System (GPS) indicate 18 mm/year of lateral strain and 3mm/yr of convergence on the OFZ near south-eastern Cuba, and 8-11 mm/yr on Jamaica.

What are the sub-regional tectonics in Jamaica?
-----------------------------------------------

Adobe Acrobat will be reqiured to retrieve this document. Sub-Regional Tectonics. Jamaica is associated with the Gonave micro-plate, which is demarcated by the Oriente Fracture Zone (OFZ) to the north, the Walton (WFZ) and Enriquillo Fault Zones (EFZ) to the south and the Cayman Spreading Centre (CSC) to the west.
