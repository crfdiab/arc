Is a volcanic mountain a convergent boundary?
---------------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseVolcanoes are a vibrant manifestation of plate tectonics processes. Volcanoes are common along convergent and divergent plate boundaries. Volcanoes are also found within lithospheric plates away from plate boundaries.

Why are earthquakes and volcanic eruptions common in a convergent plate boundary?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseEarthquakes, however, are common. Much magma is generated at a converging plate boundary where subduction is occurring. The sinking plate melts as it descends into the asthenosphere; this generates magma, which rises through the other plate to form volcanoes.

What causes volcanic activity at a convergent boundary?
-------------------------------------------------------

On the other hand, convergent boundaries are the result of compression stresses leading to plate collisions, which create numerous thrust and reverse faults that are responsible for seismic activity. Volcanic activity at convergent boundaries is created by andesitic lavas produced by the partial melting of a subducting plate.

What happens at both divergent and convergent plate boundaries?
---------------------------------------------------------------

In general,earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur at both divergent plate boundaries AND convergent plate boundaries. What forms at divergent plate boundaries?

Why is oceanic lithosphere associated with convergent boundaries?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The oceanic lithosphere would subduct because it has a higher density at 3.0 grams per cubic centimeter. Why are volcanic chains associated with convergent boundaries? Partial melting occurs due to subduction. Plate A has oceanic lithosphere on its leading edge that is 10 million years old.

Where are the volcanoes located at plate boundaries?
----------------------------------------------------

A description of the Pacific Ring of Fire along western North America is a description of the plate boundaries. Subduction at the Middle American Trench creates volcanoes in Central America. The San Andreas Fault is a transform boundary. Subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North American plate creates the Cascade volcanoes.
