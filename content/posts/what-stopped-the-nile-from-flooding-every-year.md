What stopped the Nile from flooding every year?
-----------------------------------------------

In 1970 when the Aswan High Dam was completed, the annual Nile floods and sediment stopped for most of Egypt’s civilisation which lived downstream. In addition to creating electricity, the dam allowed Egyptians to control the flow of water and build upon the Nile’s banks with certainty that it wouldn’t be flooded.

What was moved to build the Aswan Dam?
--------------------------------------

“Following the decision to build a new High Dam at Aswan in the early 1960s, the temples were dismantled and relocated in 1968 on the desert plateau 64 meters (about 200 feet) above and 180 meters (600 feet) west of their original site,” writes Robert Morkot in an article in the “Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt” ( …

Why was the Aswan dam built on the Nile river?
----------------------------------------------

The High Dam was constructed between 1960 and 1970. Its aim was to increase the amount of hydroelectric power, regulate the flooding of the Nile and increase agricultural production. The Aswan High Dam is 3,830 metres long, 980 metres wide at the base, 40 metres wide at the crest (the top) and 111 metres tall.

What dam was built on the Nile River?
-------------------------------------

Aswan High Dam  
Aswan High Dam is a rock-fill dam located at the northern border between Egypt and Sudan. The dam is fed by the River Nile and the reservoir forms Lake Nasser. Construction for the project began in 1960 and was completed in 1968.

What did people do when the Nile River flooded?
-----------------------------------------------

They harvested crops before the predictable floods, and rejoiced in the rich deposits of black soil the flood would leave behind and prepared for the years when too much or too little water would bring harm (Hoyt, 2008). If the Nile River used to consistently flood, one might ask what happened? No, the floods did not stop coming.

Why was the dam built on the Nile River?
----------------------------------------

In addition to creating electricity, the dam allowed Egyptians to control the flow of water and build upon the Nile’s banks with certainty that it wouldn’t be flooded. Furthermore, why does the river Nile not flood anymore?

How big is the lake in the Nile River?
--------------------------------------

Egyptians have relied on the annual flood seasons of the river both for drinking water and to irrigate farmlands for thousands of years. The Aswan high dam created Lake Nasser, a reservoir named after Egyptian president Gamal Nasser. At 550km long and 35km at its widest, the lake has a surface area of 5,250km² and holds 132km³ of water.

Who was the god of the Nile River?
----------------------------------

With so much of life depending on the river it’s no wonder that the Ancient Egyptians gave The Nile its very own god to look after it. He was called Hapi and the people gave thanks to him for the floodwaters.
