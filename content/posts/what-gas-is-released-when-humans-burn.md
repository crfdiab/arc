What gas is released when humans burn?
--------------------------------------

In addition to harmless compounds such as water vapor, emissions include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride gas, hydrogen fluoride, mercury vapour .

Are human bodies flammable?
---------------------------

The human body isn’t especially flammable, she reasons, and has high water content. That’s why it takes flames of around 1600 degrees Fahrenheit over two hours or more to cremate human remains. A cigarette tip, in contrast, only burns at around 700 degrees Celsius.

Do human bones burn?
--------------------

Burned Bones The skeleton does not burn in a uniform way. Some bones will burn at a higher intensity than others due to factors such as body fat distribution, proximity to the heat source, etc.

Does burning a body destroy DNA?
--------------------------------

In addition to the physical alterations, heat in the burning process also induces chemical modification of bones due to combustion and pyrolysis of chemical substances. The degree of modification increases with rising temperatures, and includes degradation of DNA, which compromises forensic identification techniques.

What temperature do bones melt?
-------------------------------

3038 °F  
Bone ash usually has a density around 3.10 g/mL and a melting point of 1670 °C (3038 °F). Most bones retain their cellular structure through calcination.

Can a human spontaneously combust?
----------------------------------

Is the possibility of suddenly bursting into flames one more thing for us all to worry about? The answer is almost certainly no. None of the proposed scientific explanations for how a body would spontaneously burst into flames have held up to scrutiny.

At what temperature do humans combust?
--------------------------------------

At 118 degrees, human skin can sustain first-degree burns; a second-degree burn injury can occur at a temperature of 131 degrees. Human skin is destroyed when temperatures reach 162 degrees.

Can a person survive 80 percent burns?
--------------------------------------

While only half the people with burns over 40 percent of their body survived in the 1940’s, ”today, over 50 percent of all patients with burns involving 80 percent of total body-surface area survive,” said Dr.

Why do we burn dead bodies?
---------------------------

Hindus believe that burning the body, and, hence, destroying it, helps the departed soul get over any residual attachment it may have developed for the deceased person. In fact, all the Dharmic faiths —Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism — believe in some variation of this fundamental principle.
