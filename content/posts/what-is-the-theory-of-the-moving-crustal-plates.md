What is the theory of the moving crustal plates?
------------------------------------------------

The theory of plate tectonics states that the Earth’s solid outer crust, the lithosphere, is separated into plates that move over the asthenosphere, the molten upper portion of the mantle. Oceanic and continental plates come together, spread apart, and interact at boundaries all over the planet.

What are three movements of the crustal plates?
-----------------------------------------------

The movement of the plates creates three types of tectonic boundaries: convergent, where plates move into one another; divergent, where plates move apart; and transform, where plates move sideways in relation to each other.

What is the theory that explains the movement of crustal plates?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The theory that’s used to explain the movement of crustal plates is the Theory of Plate Techtonics, which was created by scientists in the 1960’s. The theory was based on an earlier theory by Alfred Wegner, a German scientist, in 1912. He had observed that the continents appeared to fit together like a puzzle.

Why is the crust of the earth moving?
-------------------------------------

According to this theory, the Earth’s crust is made up of plates on which the continents and ocean rests. These plates are continually shifting because the surface beneath them — the hot, soft mantle — is moving slowly like a conveyor belt, driven by heat and other forces at work in the Earth’s core.

When do two plates move away from each other?
---------------------------------------------

Divergent occurs when two tectonic plates move away from the other. A convergent boundary is when two plates collide. A transform plate boundary occurs when two plates slide past each other. The scientific theory that explains the movement of the plates of the Earth’s crust is the theory of plate tectonics.

What causes the tectonic plates of the Earth to move?
-----------------------------------------------------

The rest of the tectonic plate gets dragged along with the oceanic lithosphere, and this causes the plates to move. Convection is another driving force behind the plate tectonics. Convection refers to specific cells that are present in the Earth’s mantle. These cells create heat, which makes the solid rocks move towards the crust.
