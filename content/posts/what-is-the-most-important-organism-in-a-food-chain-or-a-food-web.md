What is the most important organism in a food chain or a food web?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition of Trophic Levels A trophic level is a step in the food chain that each organism occupies. In a simple food chain, it is easy to see the trophic pyramid. At the base of the food chain are the producers, and at the top of the food chain are the consumers.

What is the ultimate source of energy?
--------------------------------------

Sun  
Sun â€“ The Ultimate Source Of Our Energy.

What is ultimate source of energy in an ecosystem?
--------------------------------------------------

In most ecosystems, the ultimate source of all energy is the sun.

What is the main source of a food web?
--------------------------------------

Plants  
Food chains intertwine locally into a food web because most organisms consume more than one type of animal or plant. Plants, which convert solar energy to food by photosynthesis, are the primary food source. In a predator chain, a plant-eating animal is eaten by a flesh-eating animal.

What is the first thing in a food chain?
----------------------------------------

Producers  
Producers, also known as autotrophs, make their own food. They make up the first level of every food chain. Autotrophs are usually plants or one-celled organisms.

Is the sun is the source of energy for all ecosystems?
------------------------------------------------------

The Sun is the major source of energy for organisms and the ecosystems of which they are a part. Producers, such as plants and algae, use energy from sunlight to make food energy by combining carbon dioxide and water to form organic matter. This process begins the flow of energy through almost all food webs.

What is energy in a food web?
-----------------------------

Energy is transferred between organisms in food webs from producers to consumers. The energy is used by organisms to carry out complex tasks. The vast majority of energy that exists in food webs originates from the sun and is converted (transformed) into chemical energy by the process of photosynthesis in plants.

Which is the main source of energy in the food web?
---------------------------------------------------

The sun is considered as the main source of energy on Earth. This energy is used by the green plants (producer) to make their food. Once the energy got captured, it is now will get pass through many phases of various organisms of the particular area, this is called as the food web.

Which is the ultimate source of energy for all things?
------------------------------------------------------

The sun is the ultimate source of energy for all things, as without the sun, producers could not make their own food, as no photosynthesis would happen. Other animals depend on producers as their food sources, and so if no photosynthesis happens, all producers die out, and other animals will also die.

How are food chains and food webs related to each other?
--------------------------------------------------------

There are a great many feeding relationships in any ecosystem, but energy always flows from primary producers to various consumers. These feeding relationships are represented by food chains and food webs. A food chain is a sequence in which organisms transfer energy by eating and being eaten. Here is an example of a food chain from the video.

How is the flow of energy represented in a food chain?
------------------------------------------------------

 Arrows on a food chain, or food web, represent the flow of energy. The placement of the arrows in a food chain or food web is very important. The arrows always show the direction of the energy as it is transferred from one organism to another. The flow of energy can also be represented within an energy pyramid.
