What does the second number in longitude and latitude mean?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Because the address is in numbers, people can communicate about location no matter what language they might speak. A global address is given as two numbers called coordinates. The two numbers are a location’s latitude number and its longitude number (“Lat/Long”).

What does minutes and seconds mean in latitude?
-----------------------------------------------

One degree of latitude is divided into 60 minutes (‘). One minute of latitude equals one nautical mile , which is equal to 1.15 land miles (1.85 km). Each minute of latitude is further divided into 60 seconds (“). So traditionally, positions have been expressed as degrees/minutes/seconds, e.g. 36o 15′ 32″ N.

How many seconds are in latitude and longitude?
-----------------------------------------------

3600 seconds  
60 seconds = one minute. 3600 seconds = one degree.

Why does it equal 1 minute of latitude?
---------------------------------------

One minute of latitude equals one nautical mile and degrees of latitude are 60 nm apart. The distance between degrees of longitude isn’t constant because they converge towards the poles. The metric system is not normally used in the nautical world except, increasingly, for use in charted depths and elevations.

Why are latitude and longitude measured in degrees minutes?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Because that is the way that Earth was shaped and measured in degrees of longitude and latitude in a spherical way which makes up 360 degrees. The degree of the line of longitude and latitude is divided into 60 minutes ( ‘ ) and each minute is divided into 60 seconds ( ” ).

How is one minute of latitude divided into 60 seconds?
------------------------------------------------------

One minute of latitude equals one nautical mile, which is equal to 1.15 land miles (1.85 km). Each minute of latitude is further divided into 60 seconds (“). Each minute of latitude is further divided into 60 seconds (“).

How are the lines of longitude and latitude different?
------------------------------------------------------

Stretching from North to the South, lines of Longitude are imaginary and vertical. The main longitude line is called Prime Meridian that shows 0 – degrees longitude. Map coordinates are the standard form of specifying an accurate location on the globe. Writing longitude and latitude is not only different but also follows a specific format.

When did they start measuring longitude at sea?
-----------------------------------------------

Because longitude measurements required accurate timekeeping, it wasn’t until the mid-18th century that longitude was easily and precisely measured at sea. Before then, sailors would often sail north or south to get to the desired latitude, then just head east or west until they reached the target longitude.
