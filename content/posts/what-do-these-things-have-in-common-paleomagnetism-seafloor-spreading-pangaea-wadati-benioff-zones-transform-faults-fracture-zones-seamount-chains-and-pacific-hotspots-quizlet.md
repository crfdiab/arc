What do these things have in common Paleomagnetism seafloor spreading Pangaea Wadati Benioff zones transform faults fracture zones seamount chains and Pacific hotspots quizlet?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A boundary in which crustal plates move past one another is called a: transform fault. What do these things have in common: Paleomagnetism, seafloor spreading, Pangaea, Wadati-Benioff zones, transform faults, fracture zones, seamount chains, and Pacific hotspots. They are involved with plate tectonics.

What do these things have in common Paleomagnetism?
---------------------------------------------------

What do these things have in common: Paleomagnetism, seafloor spreading, Pangaea, transform faults, and Pacific hotspots. Where do we find the most violent earthquakes? The youngest seafloor rocks are found: near the rift valleys of the mid-ocean ridges.

What type of geologic feature is formed at the intersection of two converging continental plates quizlet?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Within Earth’s mantle, convection cells move lithospheric plates toward \_\_\_\_ and away from \_\_\_\_. What type of geologic feature is formed at the intersection of two converging continental plates? Continental volcanoes form inland from certain boundaries due to magma rising to the surface.

What transports most of the sediment that forms the continental rise?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

They are carved by undersea erosion processes associated with “turbidity currents.” Turbidity currents transport sediment into deep ocean basins via submarine canyons. Turbidity currents moving down submarine canyons eventually slow down and deposit sediments on the continental rise as deep-sea fans.

Which statement is most consistent with the scientific method?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Which statement is most consistent with the scientific method? Hypotheses are tested through observation and controlled experiments.

What Cannot be determined by paleomagnetism?
--------------------------------------------

Paleomagnetism is the study of ancient pole positions and makes use of remanent magnetization to reconstruct the direction and strength of the geomagnetic field in the past. Because of the axial symmetry of the dipole field, however, paleolongitudes cannot be determined from paleomagnetic data.

Why is the continental shelf one of the most valuable places on earth?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why is the continental shelf one of the most valuable places on Earth? The continental shelf is one of the most valuable places on Earth because of oil.

Which landscape is an example of a divergent boundary?
------------------------------------------------------

Which landscape is an example of a divergent boundary? Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

Did shadow zones confirmed the presence of Earth’s core?
--------------------------------------------------------

Shadow zones confirmed the presence of Earth’s core. The mantle is the layer that accounts for most of Earth’s mass. Radiometric dating is considered a form of absolute dating. A mountain’s submerged “root” is smaller in mass than its exposed upper portion.
