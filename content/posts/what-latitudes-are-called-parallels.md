What latitudes are called parallels?
------------------------------------

Major Lines of Latitude (or Parallels) The five major parallels of latitudes from north to south are called: Arctic Circle, Tropic of Cancer, Equator, Tropic of Capricorn, and the Antarctic Circle.

Why latitude is called latitude?
--------------------------------

Latitude is the measurement of distance north or south of the Equator. It is measured with 180 imaginary lines that form circles around the Earth east-west, parallel to the Equator. These lines are known as parallels. A circle of latitude is an imaginary ring linking all points sharing a parallel.

What is parallels of latitudes short answer?
--------------------------------------------

Complete answer: Parallels of latitude are the circles which are parallels from the equator to the poles whereas the lines of reference running from the North Pole to the South Pole are called meridians of longitude. The meridian which passes through Greenwich is also known as Prime Meridian.

Who is the longest longitude?
-----------------------------

the equator  
Answer: The longest is the equator, whose latitude is zero, while at the poles, at latitudes 90° north and 90° south (or –90°), the circles shrink to a point.

Why are lines of latitude called parallels of latitude?
-------------------------------------------------------

Lines of latitudes join the places of the same latitude. These are circles drawn around the earth, parallel to the equator. Therefore, these are called parallels of latitude. Is there an error in this question or solution?

How are latitudes and longitudes measured from the equator?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Parallels also known as latitudes are measured north and south of the equator up to a maximum of 90 degrees north or south. Meridians or longitudes are measured east and west from the prime meridian which passes through Greenwich in London, up to 180 degrees.

Why are the lines of longitude called meridians?
------------------------------------------------

A better question would be, why are the lines of longitude called Meridians? Meridian comes from a Latin word meaning mid day. It’s called a Meridian because you take your readings at mid day when the sun is at it’s highest in order to know where you are on the Earth. So, the Meridians are mid day lines of Longitude.
