Does having a long cycle affect fertility?
------------------------------------------

Longer cycles are an indicator that ovulation is not occurring or at least not in a regular manner which can make conception difficult.

What can I do during my follicular phase to increase fertility?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Follicular Phase This is the time in your phase to really reduce inflammation. Having more turmeric in your diet (curry!) as well as fermented foods (think kimchi, cultured vegetables like homemade or high quality organic sauerkraut, and sprouted foods.

How long is your follicular phase?
----------------------------------

Follicular Phase (also known as the Pre-ovulatory Phase) This phase accounts for the first half of the menstrual cycle; beginning on the first day of your period and continues for 10 to 17 days. At birth, your ovaries contain all the immature eggs you will use during your entire lifespan.

Can you ovulate early with a long cycle?
----------------------------------------

By OBGYN and fertility expert Dr. Typically, women ovulate around cycle day 14 (with cycle day 1 counted as the first day of your full period). However, only a small percentage of women ovulate exactly on cycle day 14; most women actually reach their fertile window earlier or later.

Do shorter periods mean lower fertility?
----------------------------------------

Short menstrual cycle lengths and early or late onset of menstruation are associated with reduced fertility, according to a new study. The findings in the journal Annals of Epidemiology are the latest from an ongoing internet-based study of more than 2,100 women trying to get pregnant.

Can trying to conceive cause irregular periods?
-----------------------------------------------

One explanation could be a hormonal imbalance; your ob-gyn can check you for thyroid and pituitary dysfunction. Polycystic ovaries are another common cause of irregularity, but if you had regular periods even without birth control (which many women use to regulate their periods), this is unlikely.

Can I get pregnant in the follicular phase?
-------------------------------------------

Women with a long follicular phase are just as likely to get pregnant as those with a statistically more normal follicular phase. Having a longer cycle shouldn’t affect your fertility.

How can I improve my follicular phase?
--------------------------------------

Follicular Phase In this case, try to consume foods that not only support follicle development but also help you metabolize estrogen as efficiently as possible. Examples include green vegetables, nuts, seeds, eggs, fish, and legumes.

How do you feel during follicular phase?
----------------------------------------

The Follicular Phase (Days 6-14) You might notice higher energy levels, glowing skin and your sex drive may start rising. It’s common to feel optimistic and energized, so now is a great time for socializing, exercising or trying new things.

When is the ovulation period for a 30 day cycle?
------------------------------------------------

Normal 28 day cycle = ovulation occurs around day 14. 27 day cycle = ovulation occurs around day 13. 30 day cycle = ovulation occurs around day 16.

When do I ovulate on a 28 day cycle?
------------------------------------

On average, a woman with a regular 28-day cycle ovulates on about the 14th day of each cycle. If a woman’s cycle is longer or shorter than 28 days, the predicted ovulation date is changed accordingly. For example, during a 24-day cycle (4 days shorter than the average), ovulation takes place on about the 10th day.

Is a 21 day cycle too short to conceive?
----------------------------------------

In a 28-day cycle, ovulation typically occurs around day 14 and the chance of conceiving is greatest between days 11 and 14. In longer cycles, say 35 days between periods, ovulation happens around day 21 and days 18 to 21 are the most fertile days.

Can a woman with a long follicular phase get pregnant?
------------------------------------------------------

Women with a long follicular phase are just as likely to get pregnant as those with a statistically more normal follicular phase. Having a longer cycle shouldn’t affect your fertility. Having a short follicular phase could impact your likelihood of conceiving, though.

How does a short follicular phase affect fertility?
---------------------------------------------------

Shorter cycles have the potential of negatively impacting fertility. A short follicular phase essentially means that ovulation day is taking place early, when ideally, it should be taking place on day 14. Ovulating before day 11 may be an indication of poor egg quality and follicle function.

What does it mean when your follicular phase is longer than 25 days?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If your follicular phase is longer than 25 days, it’s a sign that your body is making multiple attempts to ovulate. If your body loses steam before ovulation actually occurs, you may notice multiple patches of fertile cervical mucus about two weeks apart as your estrogen and LH levels rise again.

What happens to the follicle during the menstrual cycle?
--------------------------------------------------------

When the follicle is slow to mature, this phase will last longer. Your whole menstrual cycle will also be longer as a result. A long follicular phase means that it takes more time for your body to ovulate. Using birth control pills for a long time can lengthen your follicular phase.
