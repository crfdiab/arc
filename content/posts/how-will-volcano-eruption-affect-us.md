Geothermal energy can be generated in places where the crust is thinner and so volcanic areas can be used to harness renewable energy.

What are some long term effects that an explosive volcanic eruption may cause Brainly?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer: roof collapse in built-up areas—a local effect out to distances where ash fall is a few centimetres thick (hundreds of kilometres from the volcano). Exacerbated if rain occurs or ash fall is wet.

How are volcanic eruptions affect the society by Mel Dianne?
------------------------------------------------------------

The distance you have to evacuate depends entirely on what kind of eruption is going on. For example, Pinatubo, one of the largest recent eruptions sent pyroclastic flows at least 18 km down its flanks, and pumice falls were hot and heavy even beyond that. For example, pumice 7 cm across fell at Clark Air base which is 25 km from the volcano!
