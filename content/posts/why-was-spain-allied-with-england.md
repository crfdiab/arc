Why was Spain allied with England?
----------------------------------

Why did Elizabeth I help the Dutch against Spain?
-------------------------------------------------

Protestants in the Netherlands began a revolt against Spanish rule in 1572.

Why was the Spanish Armada important to England?

It had grown extremely wealthy due to its conquests in the New World (Central America), an area that was known as the Spanish Main.

Why did the European powers help Spain during the Civil War?
------------------------------------------------------------
