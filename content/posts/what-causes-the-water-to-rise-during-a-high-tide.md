What causes the water to rise during a high tide?
-------------------------------------------------

High tides and low tides are caused by the moon. The moon’s gravitational pull generates something called the tidal force. The tidal force causes Earth—and its water—to bulge out on the side closest to the moon and the side farthest from the moon. These bulges of water are high tides.

What is it called when tide waters begin to rise?
-------------------------------------------------

Tides are one of the most reliable phenomena in the world. As the tide rises, water moves toward the shore. This is called a flood current. As the tide recedes, the waters move away from the shore.

What causes ocean waters to form high and low tides?
----------------------------------------------------

Gravity is one major force that creates tides. In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton explained that ocean tides result from the gravitational attraction of the sun and moon on the oceans of the earth (Sumich, J.L., 1996).

How are the tides related to the level of the ocean?
----------------------------------------------------

The regular rise and fall of the ocean’s waters are known as tides. Along coasts, the water slowly rises up over the shore and then slowly falls back again. When the water has risen to its highest level, covering much of the shore, it is at high tide. When the water falls to its lowest level, it is at low tide.

What causes the sea level to go up?
-----------------------------------

First, warmer temperatures cause ice on land like glaciers and ice sheets to melt, and the meltwater flows into the ocean to increase sea level. Second, warm water expands and takes up more space than colder water, increasing the volume of water in the sea. Sea level rise will hit the coasts the hardest.

What causes water levels to rise?
---------------------------------

The two major causes of global sea level rise are thermal expansion caused by warming of the ocean (since water expands as it warms) and increased melting of land-based ice, such as glaciers and ice sheets.

How are tide stations used to measure sea levels?
-------------------------------------------------

Tide stations around the globe tell us what is happening at a local level—the height of the water as measured along the coast relative to a specific point on land. Satellite measurements provide us with the average height of the entire ocean. Taken together, these tools tell us how our ocean sea levels are changing over time.
