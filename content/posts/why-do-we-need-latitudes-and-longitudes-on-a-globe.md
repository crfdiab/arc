Why do we need latitudes and longitudes on a globe?
---------------------------------------------------

The Earth is divided into degrees of longitude and latitude which helps us measure location and time using a single standard. When used together, longitude and latitude define a specific location through geographical coordinates.

What are the important longitudes on the globe?
-----------------------------------------------

Important Longitudes

<table><tr><th>Longitude</th><th>Position</th><th>Countries through which it passes</th></tr><tr><td>Prime Meridian</td><td>0° longitude</td><td>UK, France, Spain, Algeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Tongo and Ghana</td></tr><tr><td>International Date Line</td><td>180° E/W longitude</td><td>Mid-Pacific Ocean</td></tr></table>

What is the advantage of the globe?
-----------------------------------

The advantage of the globe is that it promotes visual accuracy. Students need to use a globe frequently if they are to form accurate mental maps. The advantage of the world map is that you can see the entire world at one time. The disadvantage is that world maps distort shape, size, distance, and direction.

What are the three advantages of globe?
---------------------------------------

The advantages of the globe are :

- Global is a three dimensional spherical model of planet earth.
- It shows the exact shape of the earth that is slightly spherical, flattened at the poles, and bulges at the equator.
- The physical features are more accurately shown.
- It provides the idea of the tilt of Earth’s axis.

What are two advantages of globe?
---------------------------------

Two advantages of a globe are:

- It shows us the correct shapes and sizes of the land and water masses.
- It gives us a good visual indication of the Earth’s surface.

What are the 6 parts of the globe?
----------------------------------

PARTS OF GLOBE – The Globe And Its Parts

- Equator. The central horizontal line that has the value of zero degrees latitude.
- Prime Meridian. The central 180 degrees vertical line that has the value of zero degrees latitude.
- North Pole.
- South Pole.
- Northern Hemisphere.
- Southern Hemisphere.
- Eastern Hemisphere.
- Western Hemisphere.

Why are the degrees of longitude and latitude important?
--------------------------------------------------------

The Earth is divided into degrees of longitude and latitude which helps us measure location and time using a single standard. Longitude and latitude lines measure the distance from the Earth’s Equator or central axis – running east to west – and the Prime Meridian in Greenwich, England – running north to south.

How does the globe help in geography class?
-------------------------------------------

With the help of the globe, you can see the entire Earth, at a glance. It shows you different countries, continents and oceans, along with their latitudes and longitudes. Latitudes and longitudes are measured in degrees and minutes.

Which is a special pair of latitudes and longitudes?
----------------------------------------------------

But only one point lies on a particular pair of latitude and longitude. So latitudes and longitudes are helpful in locating a point on earth. The Arctic Circle and the Tropic of Cancer are the special latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere.

Where are the latitude and longitude lines located?
---------------------------------------------------

Latitude lines are spaced every 15 degrees between the equator and the North and South Poles. Longitude lines circle the globe beginning at the prime meridian in Greenwich, England, and are also measured in 15-degree segments.
