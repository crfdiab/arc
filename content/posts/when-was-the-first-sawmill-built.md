When was the first sawmill built?
---------------------------------

1623  
In 1623 the first sawmill in the United States opened on the Piscataqua River near York, Maine. The sawmill was actually introduced before the town settled a year later. It was mainly built to export lumber to England since the colonies had an abundance of forest.

When did milled lumber start?
-----------------------------

The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill, a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD.

What type of saw does most of the work in the sawmill?
------------------------------------------------------

The band saw didn’t see widespread use until mid-century due to inferior quality blades. Today, industrial-sized band saws are the leading machines in a sawmill.

Who invented sawmill?
---------------------

Cornelis Corneliszoon van Uitgeest  
Sawmill/Inventors

Corneliszoon patented the sawmill on December 15, 1593 and the pitman on December 6, 1597. He built the first sawmill there in 1594. Before to the invention of the sawmill, boards were sawn by two men with a whipsaw, using saddleblocks to hold the log, and a pit for the pitman who worked below.

How long should logs dry before sawing?
---------------------------------------

You should seal the ends within minutes after being cut down; you should not wait hours, and definitely not days! The drying time will vary depending on the wood species and thickness of the logs, but they will take at least one to two years to dry – the longer you can leave them before you start building the better.

Who was the first person to invent the sawmill?
-----------------------------------------------

The Dutchman Cornelis Corneliszoon (1550-1607) invented his type of sawmill by applying a pitman arm onto a wind mill, which converted a turning motion into an up-an-down motion. Corneliszoon patented the sawmill on December 15, 1593 and the pitman on December 6, 1597. He built the first sawmill there in 1594.

When was the first circular saw mill built?
-------------------------------------------

The success of these mills suggested the direct action circular saw-mill and the Sharp, Davis &amp; Bonsall Company (which later became the Buckeye Engine Company) build the first of this type circular saw-mill for a large Iowa land owner in 1856.

Where was the first saw mill in Ohio?
-------------------------------------

Sharp tells us that the fore-mentioned Thomas Sharp built the “first really successful mulay saw-mill in northeastern Ohio for Leonard Case Sr. and erected the mill “five miles west of Cleveland in 1833.”.

Where did the sawmill come from in the United States?
-----------------------------------------------------

In the United States, the sawmill was introduced soon after the colonisation of Virginia by recruiting skilled men from Hamburg . Later the metal parts were obtained from the Netherlands, where the technology was far ahead of that in England, where the sawmill remained largely unknown until the late 18th century.
