Does Antarctica use renewable energy?
-------------------------------------

The most extensive use of renewable energy in Antarctica is at McMurdo Station, the primary hub for U.S. science operations on the continent. McMurdo now shares a 1 megawatt wind farm with nearby Scott Base, which is operated by New Zealand.

Do they use solar power in Antarctica?
--------------------------------------

Almost every inch is covered in solar panels – on the roof, on the walls, on the side of sleeping containers. They are even screwed to frames anchored to the ground. Solar panels have to be mounted high above the snow-covered ground to capture the 24 hours of daylight during the austral summer.

Are there windmills in Antarctica?
----------------------------------

Three new wind turbines located between the United States’ McMurdo Station and New Zealand’s Scott Base provide alternative energy for both stations. Under optimal wind conditions, the three turbines produce approximately 330 kilowatts of electricity each, for a total of 990 kw.

How do bases in Antarctica get powered with electricity?
--------------------------------------------------------

In general, the power in Antarctica has been supplied almost entirely using diesel generators. I am most familiar with the Australian stations. Wind generation is used at Mawson, as a supplement to the diesel generators, and waste heat from the generators is used for heating the stations.

Who is responsible for heat and power in Antarctica?
----------------------------------------------------

The facilities team at the British Antarctic Survey are responsible for maintaining heat and power in some of the most isolated buildings on Earth. Alex Smith finds out how remote monitoring and controls are ensuring the welfare of staff and scientists living near the South Pole

How is life like on an Antarctic station?
-----------------------------------------

Living ‘in the field’, away from the main station, you experience this difference very strongly. In other ways Antarctic life is quite like ‘home’ – people at the stations have fully insulated living and working quarters with their own rooms and bath/toilet facilities. The food is also very similar to what you would eat at home,…

What kind of wind do they get in Antarctica?
--------------------------------------------

The katabatic winds on the Antarctic continent provided the answer to that issue, as the wind gusts from the plateau are as fierce in the winter as they are in the summer.
