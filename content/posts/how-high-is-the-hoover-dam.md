How high is the Hoover Dam?
---------------------------

221 m  
Hoover Dam/Height  
How high is Hoover Dam? It is 726.4 feet from foundation rock to the roadway on the crest of the dam. The towers and ornaments on the parapet rise 40 feet above the crest.

Is the Hoover Dam the biggest dam in the world?
-----------------------------------------------

Rising 726.4 feet, Hoover Dam was the world’s tallest dam when it was built in the 1930s. These days, it’s the second-tallest dam in the U.S., having been surpassed by the 770-foot-high Oroville Dam in Northern California in 1968. Hoover Dam’s power plant was the world’s largest hydroelectric station from 1939 to 1949.

What are the pros of the Hoover Dam?
------------------------------------

Benefits. Hoover Dam controls flooding of the Colorado River and provides power and water to areas of the Pacific Southwest. The Boulder Canyon Project includes a reservoir and hydroelectric power plant. Prior to construction of the dam, flooding was damaging areas of Imperial and Palo Verde valleys.

What is special about the Hoover Dam?
-------------------------------------

Hoover Dam is 1,244 feet long at the top. It is 726 feet high from the lowest point of the foundation to the crest. The dam is 660 feet thick at the base and tapers to 45 feet thick at the top. Its reservoir was the largest artificial lake in the world for decades and is still the largest in the United States.

How tall is Hoover Dam and how much power does it produce?
----------------------------------------------------------

The Hoover Dam produces a lot of hydroelectric power. The dam is 1,244 feet wide, 726 feet tall, and 660 feet wide at its base. Water flowing out of Lake Mead, which is the entire flow of the Colorado River, enters the dam and reaches a speed of 85 miles per hour by the time it reaches the turbines.

Which is bigger the Mohne Dam or the Hoover Dam?
------------------------------------------------

Now, the Möhne dam is quite a bit smaller than the Hoover, so one would presumably need a bomb of proportionately larger power. As the Hoover is about eight times thicker than the Möhne, presumably the equivalent of about 80 tons of explosive would do the job.

Where is Hoover Dam in the United States?
-----------------------------------------

History of Hoover Dam. Amanda Briney is a professional geographer, writer, and scholar with three university degrees and an advanced certificate in GIS. Hoover Dam is a large arch-gravity dam located on the border of the states of Nevada and Arizona on the Colorado River in its Black Canyon.

How tall is the tallest dam in the world?
-----------------------------------------

Currently, the tallest dam in the world is Nurek Dam on the Vakhsh River in Tajikistan. It is 984 feet (300 meters) tall. Hoover Dam is 726.4 feet (221.3 meters) tall. Today, Hoover Dam still ranks in the top 20 of the tallest dams in the world, but only in the concrete gravity and arch categories.
