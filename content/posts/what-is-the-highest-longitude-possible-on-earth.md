What is the highest longitude possible on Earth?
------------------------------------------------

180� meridian  
Lines of longitude (meridians) running north-south around the globe measure distances EAST and WEST of the Prime Meridian. Directly on the opposite side of the earth from the prime meridian is located the 180� meridian. This is the highest longitude possible.

Can longitude exceed 90 degrees?
--------------------------------

“Longitude” goes 360 degrees, 180 East to 180 West, to cover the entire 360 degrees around the equator. So latitude only has to cover 180 degrees, from the north pole to the south pole. Taking the equator to be 0 degrees, the north pole is 180/2= 90 degrees N, the south pole is 180/2= 90 degrees S.

What is the great longitude?
----------------------------

imaginary line around the Earth running north-south, 0 degrees longitude. path or way. half of the Earth between the South Pole and the Equator.

Why there is no higher latitude than 90 degree not a 90 degree south?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Latitude is the angular distance from the plane of the Equator. Latitude only has to cover 180 degrees, from the North Pole to the South Pole. All circles make a maximum angle of 900 from the plane of the Equator. Therefore the maximum, latitude is 900 N in the Northern hemisphere and 900 S in the Southern Hemisphere.

Is 90 degree north a latitude?
------------------------------

Latitude is the measurement of distance north or south of the Equator. It is measured with 180 imaginary lines that form circles around the Earth east-west, parallel to the Equator. The latitude of the North Pole is 90 degrees N, and the latitude of the South Pole is 90 degrees S.

Which is the highest number of longitude in the world?
------------------------------------------------------

Longitude lines can take range up to +180 degrees (180 degrees east) and down to -180 degrees (180 degrees west). The +180 and -180 degree longitude coincidence directly opposite the prime meridian. The highest longitude therefore is. +180°. And the lowest. -180°.

Which is the best way to measure longitude?
-------------------------------------------

The longitude is defined as an angle pointing west or east from the Greenwich Meridian, which is taken as the Prime Meridian. The longitude can be defined maximum as 180° east from the Prime Meridian and 180° west from the Prime Meridian. Both latitude and longitude are measured in degrees,…

Where are the lines of longitude on the Earth?
----------------------------------------------

Diagram showing the lines of longitude. On the earth, the prime meridian passes through Greenwich, England. Longitude lines can take range up to +180 degrees (180 degrees east) and down to -180 degrees (180 degrees west). The +180 and -180 degree longitude coincidence directly opposite the prime meridian. -180°. Hope this helps.

Which is the maximum latitude from the prime meridian?
------------------------------------------------------

The longitude can be defined maximum as 180° east from the Prime Meridian and 180° west from the Prime Meridian. Both latitude and longitude are measured in degrees, which are in turn divided into minutes and seconds.
