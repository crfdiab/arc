Why are soldiers not allowed to march on a bridge?
--------------------------------------------------

Originally Answered: Why soldiers are not allowed to March on bridge? Soldiers are asked to break their steps when crossing a bridge because the if the frequency of their steps (rhythmic frequency) matches the natural frequency of the bridge ..then the bridge would collapse.

Why do marching soldiers break step when they come to a bridge Why don’t they continue marching?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Soldiers may be given the command to break step before crossing a bridge since the rythum of a large body of marching troops as boots hit the ground in unison reverberates throughout the structure of the bridge which can in turn cause the bridge span to move up and down to an extent which could weaken or damage the …

Why are soldiers asked to break steps?
--------------------------------------

When the troop crosses a suspension bridge the soldiers are asked to break steps because when the soldiers are in steps, all separate forces exerted by them are in same phase and hence the vibrations of a particular frequency are produced.

What caused the Tacoma bridge to collapse?
------------------------------------------

The collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge was driven by wind-generated vortices that reinforced the twisting motion of the bridge deck until it failed.

How can bridge resonance be prevented?
--------------------------------------

In order to mitigate fully the resonance effect in a bridge, engineers incorporate dampeners into the bridge design to interrupt the resonant waves and prevent them from growing. Another way to halt resonance is to give it less room to run wild.

When a troop crosses a suspension bridge the soldiers are asked to break their steps?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a troop crosses a suspension bridge, the soldiers are asked to break steps. The reason is that when soldiers march in steps, all the separate periodic forces exerted by them are in same phase and therefore forced vibrations of a particular frequency are produced in the bridge.

How far do soldiers march in a day?
-----------------------------------

Marching. The average for a march was between 8 and 13 miles per day, with 20 or more miles being more exhausting and less frequent. Also, the armies usually walked less after a battle, unless in retreat or in pursuit.

What happens when soldiers march across a bridge?
-------------------------------------------------

If soldiers march in unison across the structure, they apply a force at the frequency of their step. If their frequency is closely matched to the bridge’s frequency, the soldiers’ rhythmic marching will amplify the vibrational frequency of the bridge.

Where does a column of marching soldiers have to break?
-------------------------------------------------------

It depends on the bridge. Albert Bridge in London is known to resonate at marching pace and has signs ordering troops to break step – Henry Dec 25 ’12 at 10:27 I know it happens sometimes that the floor of concerts break of that reason. People jump up and down to the rhythm of the music.

Why do soldiers have to break their steps?
------------------------------------------

At a certain point, the bridge would start oscillating to the same rhythm as that of the marching steps. This oscillation would reach a maximum peak when the bridge can no longer sustain its own strength and hence collapses. Therefore, soldiers are ordered to break their steps while crossing a bridge.
