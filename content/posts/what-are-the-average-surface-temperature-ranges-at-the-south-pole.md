What are the average surface temperature ranges at the South Pole?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Antarctica is extremely cold. The extreme temperatures at the permanently-manned South Pole station are -14 to -81�C, and at Vostok -21 to -89�C. Near the coast above-freezing temperatures occasionally occur, and they are common on the Palmer Peninsula. But the annual mean is below 0�C everywhere (Fig 2).

What is the average temperature in the North and South Pole?
------------------------------------------------------------

Really cold, or really, really cold?

How much higher is the average temperature at the North Pole than at the South Pole?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The average temperature at the North Pole is about 32° Fahrenheit (that’s the temperature at which ice melts) in the summer and about –18° F in the winter ( polar temperatures ). The average temperature at the South Pole is about –40° F in the summer and –76° F in the winter.

Which is colder the North Pole or the South Pole?

What are the latitudes of the polar regions?
--------------------------------------------

The Polar Regions cover areas north of 60 degrees north latitude in the North Pole and 60 degrees South latitude in the South Pole.

How tall is the North Pole in feet?
-----------------------------------

The depth of the area which has the North Pole in the Arctic Ocean is 13,400 feet. Just for you to know, you need to stack 10 Empire State Buildings one above the other to reach that height. 6. There are few areas in Antarctica that didn’t receive rainfall or snow for over 2 million years!

How is the temperature inversely proportional to latitude?
----------------------------------------------------------

Temperature is inversely proportional to latitude. The latitude is a geographic coordinate that indicates the North-South position of a particular point on the surface of the earth. Latitudes are angles that range from zero degrees at the equator to 90 degrees North or 90 degrees South at the poles.
