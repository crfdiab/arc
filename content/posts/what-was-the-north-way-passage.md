What was the North way passage?
-------------------------------

The Northwest Passage (NWP) is the sea route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Arctic Ocean, along the northern coast of North America via waterways through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Arctic sea ice decline has rendered the waterways more navigable for ice navigation.

What is Canada doing to assert sovereignty in the North?
--------------------------------------------------------

In 2010, the federal government announced plans to build a fleet of six to eight “ice-capable, Arctic/Offshore Patrol Ships,” to enforce Canada’s sovereignty on its coasts, including the Arctic.

What was the story of a passage to India?
-----------------------------------------

E.M. Forster’s multi-layered masterpiece is on the surface the story of a young woman and her passage through India. On another level it’s the story of India’s independence from British rule. And there are other themes as well: mysticism, reincarnation, the clash of eastern and western cultures and religion.

Which is the shortest route from India to USA?
----------------------------------------------

1 – Shortest distance based on the curvature of the Earth: Also known as ‘Great Circle’ Route. It can an seem a bit counter-intuitive for those of us used to flat-maps. This is the biggest factor. A route based on this would most often result in the shortest flying time and lowest fuel costs (the biggest expense for an airline)

Which is better the Transpolar Passage or the Northwest Passage?
----------------------------------------------------------------

By cutting straight across the Arctic, the Transpolar Passage could save a further two days \[1\]. It might even make sailing through Arctic straits (the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage) “obsolete,” as one book suggests.

Why are there no direct flights from India to the US?
-----------------------------------------------------

Though, a fly over the exact geographical North Pole coordinates, while possible is rarer. The reason that there are no direct flights between India and the US, that fly over the North Pole, is simple: The optimum routes for current flights between India and the US do not cross the North Pole.
