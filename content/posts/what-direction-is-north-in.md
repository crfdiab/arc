What direction is north in?
---------------------------

North is one of the four compass points or cardinal directions. It is the opposite of south and is perpendicular to east and west.

Is north right or left of east?
-------------------------------

By convention, the right hand side of a map is east. This convention has developed from the use of a compass, which places north at the top. However, on maps of planets such as Venus and Uranus which rotate retrograde, the left hand side is east.

Is west left of north?
----------------------

In a map with north at the top, west is on the left.

What is the opposite direction of north west?
---------------------------------------------

East  
South: This is the direction that is the opposite of north. East: This is the direction that is the opposite of west.

Can a north arrow point to the left?
------------------------------------

This is a good one, obviously if you are able to a North arrow should always point up on a drawing, but if due to orientation of the sheet or size of the building this cannot be achieved, should the arrow point to the left or the right? Does it matter, I need hard evidence to support this. This should be fun! drums please, Fab?

Is the southern pole of a compass attracted to the south?
---------------------------------------------------------

The southern pole of a compass is attracted to the south just as much as strongly as the northern one points north. yeah, we don’t actually point our maps that way, lb!

Why are drawings oriented with South up and south down?
-------------------------------------------------------

Drawings are oriented with south up because the major work we are doing – kitchen renovation – is on the north side of the house. So the most “active” portion of the drawing is now at the bottom of the sheet. Which makes a little sense. Upstairs we are renovating the entire plan. The two sheets absolutely must be oriented the same way, obviously.

Why do I have to face north up?
-------------------------------

The only reasons I would face north up is if that happened to be where it landed (because the front facade is the south facade), or because the building is not directly on a street AND does not have an obvious front or main facade, in which case north=up would be as sensible an organizational logic as any.
