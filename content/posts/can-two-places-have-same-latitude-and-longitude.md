Can two places have same latitude and longitude?
------------------------------------------------

When you map two or more points that have the same latitude and longitude or geocode to the same address, only one of the points will show. You can work around this limitation by altering your coordinates slightly or providing a location that geocodes to a slightly different address.

Do people measure longitude and latitude differently?
-----------------------------------------------------

Latitude is your position north or south of the Equator. Lines, or parallels, are drawn around the Earth at intervals. The North Pole is assigned the latitude 90º north and the South Pole latitude 90º south. Lines of longitude, or meridians, are drawn a little differently.

What is it called when you put latitude and longitude together to describe an exact location?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A place’s absolute location is its exact place on Earth, often given in terms of latitude and longitude. For example, the Empire State Building is located at 40.7 degrees north (latitude), 74 degrees west (longitude). That is the building’s absolute location.

What is false about the prime meridian?
---------------------------------------

– The International Date Line is halfway across the globe, at 180 degrees longitude. The prime meridian is the 0 longitude line, the starting point for calculating the distance around the Earth, both east and west. Hence, B. False is the correct answer.

Can you figure out the longitude of two places?
-----------------------------------------------

If you have two places at different longitudes, and you know the longitude and time at one of the places, you can figure out the longitude of the second place – if you know what the local time is there! For example, suppose I know the longitude at Louberg is 60° W, and it’s 9 AM. Then I phone you at Luluville and you tell me it’s 10 AM there.

Is there a connection between time and longitude?
-------------------------------------------------

“Now I see the connection between time and longitude! If you have two places at different longitudes, and you know the longitude and time at one of the places, you can figure out the longitude of the second place – if you know what the local time is there! For example, suppose I know the longitude at Louberg is 60° W, and it’s 9 AM.

Why are some cities on the same latitudes different?
----------------------------------------------------

The temperature of two cities although lying on the same latitude will vary if one of them is on a sea coast, because cities close to the sea or ocean will enjoy a more equable climate. The city which is inland and far from the sea or ocean will experience extremes in temperature.

How are local times different in different parts of the world?
--------------------------------------------------------------

So, for places separated by 15° of longitude, the local time is an hour different. An hour later as you go towards the east, an hour earlier as you go towards the west! And for places separated by 45° of longitude (the ones shown in the picture), the local times are three hours different!”
