Where does warm air go when a cold front comes through?
-------------------------------------------------------

troposphere  
As a cold front moves into an area, the heavier (more dense) cool air pushes under the lighter (less dense) warm air, causing it to rise up into the troposphere.

How does the cold air in a cold front affect the warm air?
----------------------------------------------------------

Cold Fronts Along the cold front, the denser, cold air pushes up the warm air, causing the air pressure to decrease (Figure above). If the humidity is high enough, some types of cumulus clouds will grow.

Why does a cold front go under a warm air?
------------------------------------------

A cold front occurs when a mass of comparatively colder air moves into where warmer air is present. The drier, colder air forms a steeply sloping boundary under the warmer, moister air at the surface and lifts that air.

Does warm air rise at the steepest angle along a cold or warm front?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Warm fronts generally have steeper slopes than cold fronts.

Does a cold front have a gentle slope?
--------------------------------------

Typically, cold fronts have relatively steep slopes, about 1 in 30 to 40, while warm fronts have slopes of 1 in 60 to 120; thus precipitation is usually more intense and areally more concentrated at cold fronts than at warm fronts.

What happens when a warm front passes through a cold front?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Cold Front: transition zone from warm air to cold air. A cold front is defined as the transition zone where a cold air mass is replacing a warmer air mass. Cold fronts generally move from northwest to southeast. When a cold front passes through, temperatures can drop more than 15 degrees within the first hour.

Can a warm front be replaced by a cold front?
---------------------------------------------

If colder air is replacing warmer air, then the front should be analyzed as a cold front. On the other hand, if warmer air is replacing cold air, then the front should be analyzed as a warm front. Common characteristics associated with cold fronts have been listed in the table below.

When does a warm front start to form?
-------------------------------------

A warm front starts to develop when a body of advancing warmer air encounters a region with colder air. Since warm air is less dense the cold air, it cannot displace it. Instead, the leading edge of warmer mass gradually rises over the boundary of the prevailing cool air.

How are cold fronts formed in the Caribbean?
--------------------------------------------

There is a well defined boundary where this cold, dry air meets the warm, moist air of the Caribbean. The cold air is denser and heavier and so it pushes its way beneath the warm air. The warm air, which is lighter and less dense than the cold air, is forced to rise. There are strong updraughts and tall cumulonimbus clouds are formed.
