Why did the league fail to solve the Abyssinian crisis?

On the night of 2-3 October 1935, Italian forces invaded Abyssinian territory from Eritrea. At the end of an unequal struggle, during which the Italian army used chemical weapons, Abyssinia was finally conquered at the beginning of March 1936 and annexed by the Kingdom of Italy.

What is important about the Abyssinian crisis?
----------------------------------------------

The Abyssinian crisis was a diplomatic crisis that took place between 1934 and 1937 over Italy’s policy of aggression against Ethiopia. It had the direct effect of undermining the credibility of the League of Nations and encouraging fascist Italy to ally itself with Nazi Germany.

What did the League of Nations do about the Manchurian crisis?
--------------------------------------------------------------

In order to try and retain control of Manchuria the Chinese appealed to the League of Nations. In October the League of Nations passed a resolution saying that Japanese troops should withdraw and established a commission which would investigate the claims of both sides.

----------------------------------------------

The proposal ignited a firestorm of hostile reaction in Britain and France and never went into effect. Hoare lost his position. In 1935 the Abyssinian Crisis and Second Italo-Ethiopian War began. In the United Kingdom many people and the official opposition supported League of Nations sanctions against Fascist Italy, as did the Dominions.

The plan became known to the League of Nations through a leak in the French Press. The result was an outcry of public opposition to the deal. The public in the United States were also outraged that Britain and France were attempting to involve themselves in the crisis. This then stepped up their oil exports to the Italians.
