Do mealworms prefer wet or dry environments?
--------------------------------------------

The mealworm’s preferred environment is very dry, moderately warm, and dark. A bit of apple provides extra moisture for the mealworms and seems to stimulate rapid growth. As the temperature increases, so does the rate at which mealworms advance through their life cycle.

Why do mealworms need moisture?
-------------------------------

Moisture and Relative Humidity: Mealworms do require moisture. Too little moisture slows growth and reduces size. Too much can produce mold. If larvae are provided with dry food, they can survive and produce one generation a year.

What environments do mealworms prefer?
--------------------------------------

Habitat: Where Do Mealworms Live? Their normal habitat is dark, cool and moist locations where there is suitable food and sheltered areas such as under rocks, logs, in animal waste accumulations and in moist, stored grain storage areas.

How do you speed up mealworm metamorphosis?
-------------------------------------------

Seal the containers and place them in a warm, dark area. Warmth speeds up the life cycle process, so your mealworms will pupate faster if they are kept warm.

Why do mealworms die?
---------------------

When pupae die and turn black, it’s usually because the worms weren’t given enough moisture with carrots or potatoes at the end of the larval stage. They need to store the moisture to last through pupation and will dehydrate and die if they didn’t get enough.

At what temperature do mealworms die?
-------------------------------------

The cooler temperatures will delay the process of metamorphosis, which stops them from continuing their life cycle and turning into beetles. Therefore, store your container of mealworms in your refrigerator (at 45-50 degrees F), this will cause them to go into a dormant state and be usable for feeding for 6-10 weeks.

Why are my mealworms dying?
---------------------------

How long does it take for mealworms to turn into eggs?
------------------------------------------------------

The mealworm undergoes complete metamorphosis. The female darkling beetle lays hundreds of tiny, white, oval eggs, which hatch into tiny mealworms (the larval stage) – it takes from 4 to 19 days to hatch. Each mealworm eats a tremendous amount and grows a lot, molting (shedding its exoskeleton) many times as it grows.

Do mealworms prefer warm or cold?
---------------------------------

The mealworm prefers a warm habitat. When raising mealworms, keeping them in a warm habitat (77 to 81 degrees F) will cause them to grow much faster than in a cool or cold environment.

What is the lifespan of a mealworm?
-----------------------------------

Generally, the life cycle of a mealworm can take anywhere between four months and a year. The mealworm life cycle begins in late spring or early summer when female beetles seek dark, secluded areas to lay their eggs.

How long does it take a mealworm to turn into a beetle?
-------------------------------------------------------

Two or three weeks after the mealworm has pupated, a mealworm beetle will emerge. This is known as a darkling beetle. The egg stage typically lasts 7-14 days but low temperatures and humidity can lengthen double this incubation time.

Can dried mealworms come back to life?
--------------------------------------

They are dead, they can’t come back to life, hibernation and suspended animation, probably, freeze dried never.

How does temperature affect the development of a mealworm?
----------------------------------------------------------

Mealworms, like all insects, are are cold-blooded organisms and so changes in the environment affect the rate at which physical changes occur.ï¿½ Normally, increases in temperature speed up the rate of change.ï¿½ Rapid development is due to an increase in metabolism…

How to know if a mealworm is an adult?
--------------------------------------

5.ï¿½ Check vials for the presence of adult mealworms.ï¿½ Once an adult mealworm is observed in a vial, record the number of days since the experiment began.

Why do people live longer in cold climates or hot climates?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Still, life expectancy tends to be much lower there. In snowy and cold areas, heart attacks with strokes take off a year or two of life on average Extreme heat can do the same, though it is more comfortable for an aged body to live in extreme heat than cold.
