What happens to the size of Antarctica in winter?
-------------------------------------------------

Its size varies through the seasons, as expanding sea ice along the coast nearly doubles the continent’s size in the winter. Almost all of Antarctica is covered with ice; less than half a percent of the vast wilderness is ice-free.

How big is Antarctica in the winter?
------------------------------------

The world’s largest seasonal event is the change from summer to winter ice in Antarctica. The ice undergoes a change in area from 3 million square kilometres to 20 million square kilometres in the winter.

Why does Antarctica appear larger in winter?
--------------------------------------------

In the southern hemisphere winter, when emperor penguins huddle together against the biting cold, ice on the sea around Antarctica has been increasing since the late 1970s, perhaps because climate change means shifts in winds, sea currents or snowfall. The average year-round ice extent has risen too.

Where are the west and east coasts of Antarctica?
-------------------------------------------------

Moving clockwise we go around the East Antarctic coast all the way to the Ross Sea, south of New Zealand. Next comes the Amundsen Sea, which large West Antarctic glaciers like Pine Island and Thwaites drain into. And continuing on, we complete our trip around Antarctica, coming to the Bellingshausen Sea to the left of the Antarctic Peninsula.

Is the Weddell Sea part of the Antarctic Peninsula?
---------------------------------------------------

The ocean around Antarctica is divided into several seas. Starting to the right of the Antarctic Peninsula on the map above is the Weddell Sea, which extends to Cape Norvegia, a small point of land jutting off of East Antarctica.

How is Antarctica surrounded by the Southern Ocean?
---------------------------------------------------

Antarctica is surrounded on all sides by the Southern Ocean. During the winter, ocean water freezes, forming a layer of sea ice of roughly the same area as the Antarctic continent. The ocean around Antarctica is divided into several seas.

Where are the glaciers on the east side of Antarctica?
------------------------------------------------------

Moving clockwise we go around the East Antarctic coast all the way to the Ross Sea, south of New Zealand. Next comes the Amundsen Sea, which large West Antarctic glaciers like Pine Island and Thwaites drain into.
