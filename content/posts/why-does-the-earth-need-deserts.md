Why does the earth need deserts?
--------------------------------

The dry condition of deserts helps promote the formation and concentration of important minerals. Gypsum, borates, nitrates, potassium and other salts build up in deserts when water carrying these minerals evaporates. Minimal vegetation has also made it easier to extract important minerals from desert regions.

How does desert affect life?
----------------------------

Human exploitation of fragile ecosystems can lead to the droughts and arid conditions characteristic of desertification. Effects include land degradation, soil erosion and sterility, and a loss of biodiversity, with huge economic costs for nations where deserts are growing.

Are deserts necessary?
----------------------

LOCATION: Although few animals and plants are adapted to the extremely dry desert life, the desert is a vital biome. The desert is important because it covers about a fifth of the earth’s surface! Antarctica is the largest desert in the world, while the Sahara in Africa is the largest of the hot deserts.

What would the Earth be like without water?
-------------------------------------------

Water is an integral part of earth: from the plants and animals it sustains to the land it erodes through water and ice. Earth would be a desolate place without water.

Can you survive without water in the desert?
--------------------------------------------

Water is everywhere, even in the desert. First of all, the human body is composed of 70 percent water. While the human body can endure a month without food, it can only go a week without water. Likewise, all plants and animals need water to survive.

What would life on Earth be like without oxygen?
------------------------------------------------

To them free oxygen was just a byproduct, but it eventually built up to the point where the majority of the planet went from an anaerobic (without oxygen) environment to an aerobic (with oxygen) environment. Could life have evolved to the point where we are now without oxygen? Maybe, but it would be much more difficult.

How does the human body survive without food?
---------------------------------------------

While the human body can endure a month without food, it can only go a week without water. Likewise, all plants and animals need water to survive. Animals and plants, including humans, obtain most of their water from rivers, lakes and groundwater–the main sources of freshwater on earth.
