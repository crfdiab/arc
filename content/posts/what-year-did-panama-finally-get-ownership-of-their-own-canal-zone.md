What year did Panama finally get ownership of their own canal zone?

When was the Panama Canal Zone acquired?
----------------------------------------

May 4, 1904  
The Canal Zone came into being on May 4, 1904 (“Acquisition Day”), under the terms of the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903 by which Panama granted to the United States, in return for annual payments, the sole right to operate and control the canal and about 5 miles (8 km) of land on each side.

Who was in charge of building the Panama Canal?
