How are cooling towers powered?
-------------------------------

As the water flows through the cooling tower, it is exposed to air, which is being pulled through the tower by the electric motor-driven fan. When the water and air meet, a small amount of water is evaporated, creating a cooling action.

Which working fluid is used in cooling tower?
---------------------------------------------

Heat transfer methods wet cooling towers or evaporative cooling towers operate on the principle of evaporative cooling. The working coolant (usually water) is the evaporated fluid, and is exposed to the elements.

What are the chemicals used in cooling tower?
---------------------------------------------

Here are the main chemicals that are frequently used in cooling tower water treatment:

- Corrosion and Scale Inhibitors.
- Algaecides and Biocides.
- pH Adjusters. What controls a cooling tower?
    ------------------------------
    
    The approach controller (TDIC-1) controls the cooling water supply temperature from the cooling tower by modifying the air flow as required.
    
    What is the difference between crossflow and counterflow cooling towers?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    In a crossflow tower, air travels horizontally across the direction of the falling water whereas in a counterflow tower air travels in the opposite direction (counter) to the direction of the falling water. This is because of the air inlets on each style of tower.
    
    What is a purpose of cooling tower?
    -----------------------------------
    
    Cooling towers are primarily used for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and industrial purposes. Cooling towers provide a cost-effective and energy efficient operation of systems in need of cooling. More than 1,500 industrial facilities use large quantities of water to cool their plants 2.
    
    Which type of cooling tower is best?
    ------------------------------------
    
    their design flexibility and cost effectiveness, make mechanical draft cooling towers ideally suited to most cooling duties and plant requirements. Unlike natural draft cooling towers, these towers use fans to circulate air through the tower. Propeller fans and centrifugal fans are most often used.

    When do you take BTUs out of a cooling tower?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    If steam is coming in, or doing any kind of heating, you have to take the BTUs out at some point. A cooling tower is, in essence, a heat exchanger. It rejects waste heat to the atmosphere by using air and water in direct or indirect contact to remove process heat and bring a water stream down to a lower temperature.
    
    What kind of fill is used in a cooling tower?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    Cooling tower fill is the main heat transfer area available for heat transfer from hot water to cold air. There are two types of fills are used one splash fills and the other is film fills.
    
    How does the condenser work in a cooling tower?
    -----------------------------------------------
    
    When the warm condenser goes into the cooling tower, the water is passed through some nozzles which is sprayed into small droplets across the fill, which increases the surface area of water and allows for better heat loss thru greater evaporation.
