How does pollution affect where fish live in the water column?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Organic matter and nutrients causes an increase in aerobic algae and depletes oxygen from the water column. This causes the suffocation of fish and other aquatic organisms. Sulfate particles from acid rain can cause harm the health of marine life in the rivers and lakes it contaminates, and can result in mortality.

Can heavy rain kill fish?
-------------------------

Many fish kills occur after several days of cloudy weather, early in the morning, or after heavy rain events. This quick ‘turnover’ of the water can quickly decrease the amount of oxygen available to fish, essentially causing them to suffocate.

How many fish die each year because of pollution?
-------------------------------------------------

The Problem: Over 1 million marine animals (including mammals, fish, sharks, turtles, and birds) are killed each year due to plastic debris in the ocean (UNESCO Facts &amp; Figures on Marine Pollution). Currently, it is estimated that there are 100 million tons of plastic in oceans around the world.

How does water pollution affect the environment and fish?
---------------------------------------------------------

Pollution can directly kill or harm fish, or change the makeup of the fish’ surroundings, killing off sources of food or causing plant or algae overgrowth that starve the fish of oxygen. When a fish feeds on harmful algae, it ingests toxins that accumulate in its body and are passed on to other fish that eat them.

How are fish affected by water pollution Indiana American water?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Do not throw fish waste back into the waterway. Fish waste can be incorporated back into the ecosystem on land, but throwing waste into the water can cause contamination. Indiana American Water is committed to keeping Hoosier water quality at its highest level. Water quality is not only important for humans, but for our fish populations, too.

How are fish affected by the algal blooms?
------------------------------------------

Over time, these nutrients build up in the water and promote algae and water plant growth, and as they decay, they lower oxygen levels in the water. Algal blooms can be harmful to fish as they feed upon algae, toxins accumulate within the fish, and when a predator fish consumes that fish, they too are consuming higher toxin levels.

How does burning fossil fuels affect the environment of fish?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Burning fossil fuels outputs heavy metals into the atmosphere which deposit into bodies of water. Heavy metals in water stunt growth and impair a fish’s sense of smell, which hampers its ability to find food or avoid predators. Fish feed on invertebrates that live in the water.
