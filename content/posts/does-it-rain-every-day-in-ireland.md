Does it rain every day in Ireland?
----------------------------------

Does it rain a lot in Ireland? Yes, depending on where you go. When measured as more than 1mm of rainfall a day, the average rainfall in the South and East of the Country is about 150 days of rain a year, while the West Coast gets about 225 days a year.

Does it ever stop raining in Ireland?
-------------------------------------

No. Ireland has a temperate climate and is never cold in the way that most of Europe and North America gets in winter time. It is uncommon for it to drop below freezing during the day. Rain is not as common as people think.

Why it rains so much in Ireland?
--------------------------------

Irish rains are generally light and fast. This is due to the island’s position next to the Atlantic Ocean. Ireland is influenced by the Gulf Stream – a warm ocean stream that comes from Mexico – which makes the climate a little unstable.

Is Ireland as rainy as England?
-------------------------------

Ireland and the UK get pretty similar levels of rainfall, but Ireland (in the West especially) gets a bit more overall. This is mainly due to its proximity to the Atlantic ocean.

Why is it so hot in Ireland?
----------------------------

Because the island is hugged all year round by the warm influence of the Gulf Stream, Ireland is much warmer than other countries that share its latitude. The Gulf Stream also ensures that the Irish coastline remains ice-free throughout winter.

Do you get a lot of rain in Ireland?
------------------------------------

Yes. Ireland will get rain throughout the entire year. While August will not get nearly as much rain as in winter, it will still see some. August will have a higher temperature than other months, but it will still be milder in Ireland than in other parts of Europe.

What’s the climate like on the island of Ireland?
-------------------------------------------------
