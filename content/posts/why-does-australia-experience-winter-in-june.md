Why does Australia experience winter in June?
---------------------------------------------

The northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun and the Southern hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun. The entire southern hemisphere experiences winter during June, July, August, and September, not just Australia. The reason for this is the tilt of the Earth.

Why is it hotter in December than in June in the Southern Hemisphere?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The reason we have seasons is that the Earth’s axis is slighlty tilted so that in December the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun and the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun. However, in reality, summers are hotter in the northern hemisphere.

Why is Australian summer in December?
-------------------------------------

It’s because the spin of the Earth is actually wonky. The axis of the Earth is tilted, which means that in summer we (in the UK) are leaning towards the Sun. As we travel around the Sun, we begin to tilt away and it becomes winter. This is why when we have winter, Australia has summer.

How cold is it in Australia in June?
------------------------------------

Most other southern cities are a bit warmer, with Melbourne and Adelaide experiencing average highs in the high 50s F (14-15° C). Coastal Sydney and Perth, despite being quite far south, stay relatively mild in June, with highs around 65° F (18° C).

Why is it colder in December than June?

Why is it hot in December and cold in June?
-------------------------------------------

It is hot in December and cold in June because the Earth is a “ball.” Yep. A Ball. It’s tilted and circles the sun in a slightly elliptical orbit. So, when it’s hot in December the Southern part of the ball is closer to the sun because of the tilt. That means the Northern part of the ball is further from the sun and that part is cold.

What kind of weather is there in Australia?
