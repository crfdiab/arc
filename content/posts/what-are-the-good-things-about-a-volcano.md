What are the good things about a volcano?
-----------------------------------------

They helped cool off the earth removing heat from its interior. Volcanic emissions have produced the atmosphere and the water of the oceans. Volcanoes make islands and add to the continents. Volcanic deposits are also used as building materials.

What things come out of volcanoes?
----------------------------------

In an eruption, gases and rock shoot up through the opening and spill over or fill the air with lava fragments. Eruptions can cause lava flows, hot ash flows, mudslides, avalanches, falling ash and floods.

What bad things do volcanoes do?
--------------------------------

Volcanoes spew hot, dangerous gases, ash, lava, and rock that are powerfully destructive. People have died from volcanic blasts. Volcanic eruptions can result in additional threats to health, such as floods, mudslides, power outages, drinking water contamination, and wildfires.

How are volcanoes good things for the Earth?
--------------------------------------------

This process breaks down nutrients in the ash and rock delivering it slowly to the plants. Volcanoes have done wonderful things for the Earth. They helped cool off the earth removing heat from its interior. Volcanic emissions have produced the atmosphere and the water of the oceans. Volcanoes make islands and add to the continents.

What kind of materials can volcanoes be used for?
-------------------------------------------------

High-density basalt and diabase aggregate are used in the concrete shields of nuclear reactors. Hardened volcanic ash (called tuff) makes an especially strong, lightweight building material. The ancient Romans combined tuff and lime to make a strong, lightweight concrete for walls, and buildings.

What kind of energy does a volcano produce?
-------------------------------------------

The internal heat associated with young volcanic systems has been harnessed to produce geothermal energy. Most of the metallic minerals mined in the world, such as copper, gold, silver, lead, and zinc, are associated with magmas found deep within the roots of extinct volcanoes.

What are the effects of volcanoes on the environment?
-----------------------------------------------------

Thatâ€™s a good question. I guess the main good effect that volcanoes have on the environment is to provide nutrients to the surrounding soil. Volcanic ash often contains minerals that are beneficial to plants, and if it is very fine ash it is able to break down quickly and get mixed into the soil.
