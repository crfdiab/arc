Would you move if you farted in space?
--------------------------------------

So if an astronaut farted hard enough in space, would he/she move around? Short answer: Yes. Flatulence would propel an astronaut forward, but very slowly. But if you used the gas as fuel for a combustion reaction, the astronaut could get going much faster.

Has anyone ever pooped in space?
--------------------------------

Instead of wasting more time, mission control concluded that Shepard could safely pee inside his spacesuit. The first American in space went up in damp underwear. Fortunately, there’s a toilet on the space station these days. To poop, astronauts lift the toilet lid and sit on the seat — just like here on Earth.

Do female astronauts shave their legs in space?
-----------------------------------------------

Both female and male astronauts shave in space and are provided with either an electric razor or a disposable razor. Most astronauts choose electric razors because of the scarcity of running water on the ISS.

Can a fart be a problem in space?
---------------------------------

The gases in farts are flammable, which can quickly become a problem in a tiny pressurized capsule in the middle of space where your fart gases have no where to go. In this “oldie but goodie” study from the late 1960s, scientists fed subjects a then-state-of-the-art space diet compared with a “bland formula.”

How does a fart propel an astronaut forward?
--------------------------------------------

Flatulence would propel an astronaut forward very slowly, but if you used the gas as fuel for a combustion reaction the astronaut could get going much faster. Longer answer: Gas diffusing will carry a small amount of momentum backwards, so it must exert a force on the person, pushing them forward. Essentially, farts are rocket fuel.

What happens if you fart in Zero G?
-----------------------------------

Assuming you’ve put your sandwich down, here are five fart facts: 1. It doesn’t move “If you fart in zero G, you have a major problem,” said Derrick Pitts from The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, US. Speaking to tech blog, Geekadelphia, he explained: “If you fart…the gas stays right there.

What happens when you fart in the wind?
---------------------------------------

For example, the joy (or discomfort) of passing wind. Thankfully the internet has already thought of this question and come up with a few interesting points about the not-so-appealing process. Hint: if you’re eating you may not want to continue reading this. Assuming you’ve put your sandwich down, here are five fart facts: 1. It doesn’t move
