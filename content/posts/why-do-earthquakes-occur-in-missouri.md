Why do earthquakes occur in Missouri?
-------------------------------------

The New Madrid Seismic Zone runs about 150 miles from southeast Missouri in the bootheel, through Arkansas and into Tennessee. A seismic zone is a series of imperfections, or cracks below the ground, where Earth’s plates shift, causing earthquakes. The New Madrid fault line cranks out around 200 earthquakes every year.

--------------------------------------------------------

When viewing the maps, it is important to remember that areas with high earthquake hazards do not necessarily face high seismic risks.

Which is the best definition of seismic hazard?
-----------------------------------------------

Seismic hazard is the hazard associated with potential earthquakes in a particular area, and a seismic hazard map shows the relative hazards in different areas.

How is the probability of an earthquake determined?
---------------------------------------------------

The National Seismic Hazards Mapping project provides an online Web tool for determining the probability of a large earthquake within 50 kilometers (~31 miles) of a specific location in the United States over a certain time period. The calculation is based on the latest available information from seismic hazard data.
