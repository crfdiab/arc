6 Types of Data in Statistics &amp; Research: Key in Data Science

- Quantitative data. Quantitative data seems to be the easiest to explain.

- Discrete data.
- Continuous data. What do we mean by collecting data?
    -----------------------------------
    
    Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest, in an established systematic fashion that enables one to answer stated research questions, test hypotheses, and evaluate outcomes.

    The way you collect your data should relate to how you’re planning to analyze and use it.
