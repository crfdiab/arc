Which is closest to the Earth Sun Moon or clouds?
-------------------------------------------------

Earth’s closest neighbor, the Moon is the only other object in space that humans have ever set foot on. Together, the Sun, Earth, and Moon are responsible for ocean tides, eclipses, and the phases of the Moon. But they couldn’t be more different when it comes to size and structure.

Is the Moon the closest object to Earth?
----------------------------------------

Earth’s moon is the brightest object in our night sky and the closest celestial body. At perigee — its closest approach — the moon comes as close as 225,623 miles (363,104 kilometers). At apogee — the farthest away it gets — the moon is 252,088 miles (405,696 km) from Earth.

What object is closer to Earth?
-------------------------------

Although Venus is the planet that comes closest to Earth as it sweeps by on its orbit, Mercury stays the closest to Earth the longest, according to a commentary published Tuesday (March 12) in the magazine Physics Today.

Which is further the Moon or sun?
---------------------------------

Although the sun is 27 million times more massive than the moon, it is 390 times further away from the Earth than the moon.

Why do clouds appear to be behind the Sun and Moon?
---------------------------------------------------

clouds behind moon clouds behind sun conspiracies flat earth Sometimes clouds appear to be behind the sun or the moon in photos and videos, like the example above ( source ). This confuses people, as the sun is 93 million miles away, so it’s impossible for clouds to be behind it.

How many miles above the Earth are the clouds?
----------------------------------------------

The clouds are between one and four miles above the Earth. The Moon is a quarter of a million miles, and the Sun wins at 93 million miles. Sometimes it looks like the clouds go behind the Moon or the Sun, but this is an optical illusion caused by the brightness of the Moon and the Sun piercing through the clouds rather than being blocked by them.

Which is closer to the Earth the sun or the Moon?
-------------------------------------------------

The question is in relation to the Earth. Since clouds obscure both Sun and Moon they are closest. Since the Moon may obscure the Sun, it is closer than the Sun. Therefore, from farthest to closest Sun~Moon~clouds~Earth.

Where can you see clouds in the sky?
------------------------------------

Colorful clouds and calm water create a striking sunset scene for canoeists on Winisk River in Ontario, Canada. A single cloud may hold billions of pounds of water—but not all clouds bring rain.
