What are the components of a biotic community?
----------------------------------------------

Biotic components include plants, animals, decomposers. Nonliving components include air, water, land. A food chain is a chain in an ecosystem where there is transfer of food and energy from one organism to another in a sequence. Thus, the correct answer is ‘Food chain and decomposers.

What are biotic communities?
----------------------------

Biotic communities are regional plant formations characterized by particular species of plants and animals. The biotic communities shown depict regional formations within recognized biotic and floristic provinces.

What are the three biotic community?
------------------------------------

All the living organisms sharing a common environment . The members of a biotic community are usually divided into three major categories: producers, consumers, and decomposers , based on the organisms’ nutritional habits.

What are the biotic components of an ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------------

Biotic components or Biotic factors are all the living things in an ecosystem. They are the animals, the plants and the microorganisms. Biotic factors also include waste from living things and dead organisms. Even the harshest corners of our planet have biotic factors.

What makes an organism part of a biotic community?
--------------------------------------------------

Each unit is called Population. The organisms of different populations have features in common due to abiotic factors in the environment, like light, water, temperature, radiation, etc. The biotic environments, i.e. plants and animals present in a particular area also influence the density of a particular group of population.

How are living organisms affected by biotic factors?
----------------------------------------------------

An ecosystem is the living organisms in a particular area together with the non-living components of the environment, such as soil, air and water. An ecosystem is biodiverse if it contains many different species. The abundance and distribution of organisms in an ecosystem are affected by biotic factors, which involve living organisms.

How are living things involved in the ecosystem?
------------------------------------------------

The organisms of most ecosystems obtain in three basic ways: producing, consuming, and decomposing. Organisms that make their own food from inorganic molecules and solar energy are called producers.
