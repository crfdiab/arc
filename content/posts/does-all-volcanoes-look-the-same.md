Does all volcanoes look the same?
---------------------------------

No, the same volcano can produce different magmas at different times and sometimes even in the same eruption. Volcanic rocks have plutonic equivalents, for example the volcanic rock rhyolite has the same general chemistry as the plutonic rock granite although they look very different.

Can volcanoes be different shapes?
----------------------------------

Volcanoes are classified by the eruption type and by the volcanic cone shape. There are three basic cone shapes and six eruption types. The three cone shapes are cinder cones, shield cones, and composite cones or stratovolcanoes.

Why are all volcanoes different shapes?
---------------------------------------

Volcanoes have several shapes, which are controlled by the composition of the magma and the nature of its eruption. If a volcano produces very fluid lava (low in the compound SiO2, or silica), the magma flows a long distance before it cools, making a flat, shield-shaped volcano.

How are the different shapes of volcanoes formed?
-------------------------------------------------

When magma erupts at the surface as lava, it can form different types of volcano depending on: the viscosity, or stickiness, of the magma. the amount of gas in the magma. the composition of the magma.

What are 3 types of volcano?
----------------------------

There are three types of volcanoes: cinder cones (also called spatter cones), composite volcanoes (also called stratovolcanoes), and shield volcanoes.

Is the shape of a volcano the same as its size?
-----------------------------------------------

Most land volcanoes have the same basic structure, but volcano shape and size varies considerably. There are several elements that these different volcano types have in common are:

What are the names of the different types of volcanoes?
-------------------------------------------------------

Geologists generally group volcanoes into four main kinds–cinder cones, composite volcanoes, shield volcanoes, and lava domes. Cinder cones are the simplest type of volcano.

What kind of volcano is a stratovolcano?
----------------------------------------

Chile’s Villarrica Volcano is a stratovolcano. Most land volcanoes have the same basic structure, but volcano shape and size varies considerably. There are several elements that these different volcano types have in common are: a central vent – leads from the magma chamber to the summit crater.

How are cinder cones different from other volcanoes?
----------------------------------------------------

Unlike some of the other types of volcanoes—namely, shield volcanoes and composite volcanoes—cinder cones are usually created from a single opening. The opening of a cinder cone is a cone-shaped structure, while the steeps are formed of the erupted, fragmented cinders that fall close to the chimney/vent.
