Though Mexico City itself is landlocked, there are plenty of opportunities here to frolic in the water and swim at the beach.

The closest beaches to Mexico City are Acapulco which is the oppposite direction you are traveling and Veracruz. Both of which are about 4-5 hours by car so probably 6 hours by bus.

Where are the beaches in San Carlos Mexico?
-------------------------------------------

The city sits at the top of a giant cove, and the San Carlos coastline actually runs east and west, rather than north and south. In town, the 1.5 miles (2 kms) of beaches are mostly behind oceanfront homes and buildings. But as soon as you leave town heading down the coast, you’ll encounter over 3 miles (4.9 kms) of beautiful, uninterrupted beach.
