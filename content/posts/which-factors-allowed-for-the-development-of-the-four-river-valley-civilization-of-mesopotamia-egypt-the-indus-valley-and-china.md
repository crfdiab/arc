4. – A surplus of food.
5. – The Division of Labor.
What led to the development of the four river valley civilizations?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The civilization was created after regular trading started relationships between multiple cities and states around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Mesopotamian cities became self-run civil governments.

What are the reasons for the development of major civilizations formed in river valleys Egypt China India and Mesopotamia?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These early civilizations began to form around the time of the Neolithic Revolution (12000 BCE). Rivers were attractive locations for the first civilizations because they provided a steady supply of drinking water and made the land fertile for growing crops.

Which factor led to the development of civilizations in ancient Mesopotamia?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most significant factors that led to the development of civilizations in ancient Mesopotamia were the Tigris and Euphrates rivers–since these rivers provided crucial irrigation for crop development.

What factor led to the development of civilizations?

Many people no longer had to practice farming, allowing a diverse array of professions and interests to flourish in a relatively confined area.

Which factor led to the development of civilizations in ancient civilizations?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The answer is the advantage of the geographic location. This led to the development of civilizations in the ancient Mesopotamia. These geographical advantages include the rivers and the fertile lands. They took advantage of the very fertile soil and began farming.

Why did the first civilizations develop in river valleys?
---------------------------------------------------------

The first civilizations developed in four separate river valleys. Each of these river valleys offered a mild climate and a water highway to other places. Water from the rivers also could be used for drinking and for cooking food. Each of these valleys was also a flood plain where an overflowing river deposited fertile soil.

How did flooding affect the people of Mesopotamia?

However, Mesopotamia is different because the two rivers kept the land fertile through regular flooding of the area. Like the Nile River in Egypt, the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers allowed the Mesopotamians to grow crops and to settle between these two rivers.
