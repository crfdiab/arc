Which fossil fuel burns cleanest?
---------------------------------

Natural gas  
Natural gas is a relatively clean burning fossil fuel Burning natural gas for energy results in fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2) than burning coal or petroleum products to produce an equal amount of energy.

What is polluting the most?
---------------------------

1\. Energy. No big surprise that the production of energy makes up one of the biggest industrial contributions to carbon emissions. Collectively making up 28% of the United States Greenhouse Gas contributions.

But major fossil fuel companies—including ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Peabody Energy, Consol Energy, and Arch Coal—are substantial contributors to the problem, and therefore must take responsibility for their actions.

How is the burning of fossil fuels used?
