-----------------------------------

Your bank or credit union is almost always the best place to exchange currency.

- Before your trip, exchange money at your bank or credit union.
- Once you’re abroad, use your financial institution’s ATMs, if possible.
- After you’re home, see if your bank or credit union will buy back the foreign currency. What is the equilibrium rate of exchange?
    -----------------------------------------
    
    The equilibrium exchange rate is the long-term exchange rate that equals the purchasing power parity (PPP) of a currency in a world where all goods are traded and where markets are fully efficient.
    
    Why is fixed exchange rate bad?

    The downside, of course, is that countries with fixed exchange rates forfeit control of their monetary policy. That makes them more susceptible to financial shocks elsewhere in the world and can lead to more frequent and aggressive attacks by speculators.
