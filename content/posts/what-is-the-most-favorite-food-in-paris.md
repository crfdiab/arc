    For me, the best part of visiting Paris is, by far, the food. It’s honestly hard to have a really bad meal in Paris. I grew up on a very cultural diet, French food being a big part of it. Crepes were always a standard meal in our house along with duck and bread. So it sometimes feels like coming home when I eat in Paris. Report this ad

    Which is the best croissant to eat in Paris?
    --------------------------------------------
    
    A great option is La Maison d’Isabelle (47ter Boulevard Saint-Germain), which recently received an award for Best Croissant in Paris. The boulangerie makes truly unforgettable croissants using organic flour and certified butter from the Charente-Poitou region. Few pleasures in life rival that of a freshly baked croissant. 2.
