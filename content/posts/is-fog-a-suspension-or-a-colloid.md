Is fog a suspension or a colloid?
---------------------------------

Fog is a colloid in which drops of liquid water are spread through the air. Milk is a colloid, in which globs of fat stay suspended in watery fluid.

Is fog an example of suspension?
--------------------------------

Particles of suspension are large enough to scatter rays of light and path of ray is visible through a suspension. Example of suspension – mixture of chalk and water, muddy water, mixture of flour and water, mixture of dust particles and air, fog, milk of magnesia, etc.

Is smoke and fog a suspension?
------------------------------

When light is passed through a true solution, the dissolved particles are too small to deflect the light. You have undoubtedly “seen” a light beam as it passes through fog, smoke, or a scattering of dust particles suspended in air. All three are examples of colloids.

Does fog is a colloid?
----------------------

Fog is an aerosol, a type of colloid consisting of a liquid (water) dispersed in a gas (air).

What are 5 examples of suspension?
----------------------------------

Examples of Suspension

- Muddy water.
- Milk of magnesia.
- Sand particles suspended in water.
- Flour in water.
- Slaked lime for whitewashing.
- Paints in which dyes are suspended in turpentine oil.

Is apple juice a solution colloid or suspension?
------------------------------------------------

Apple juice can also be solution and a suspension . It more likely to be a mixture if it made with apple pulp and not extracted from it ,or it can be a solution if it squeezed out of apple pulp . SOLUTION REPRESENTS A HOMOGENOUS LIQUID WHICH DOESN’T HAVE ANY VISIBLE PARTICLES OF A SOLUTE THROUGH SOLVENT.

What are 3 types of suspension?
-------------------------------

There are three basic types of suspension components: linkages, springs, and shock absorbers.

What is suspension with example?
--------------------------------

Ans: Common examples of suspension include the mixture of chalk and water, muddy water, the mixture of flour and water, a mixture of dust particles and air, fog, milk of magnesia, etc. In it, particles of the solute do not dissolve in the solution and are rather suspended.

Is peanut butter a suspension?
------------------------------

Peanut butter is a colloid i.e. it is a suspension of small insoluble particles (finely ground peanuts) in a liquid (oil).

Why is peanut butter a suspension?
----------------------------------

Suspended particles settle out of a suspension. Colloids contain some particles that are intermediate between those in a solution and those in a suspension. Examples include peanut butter, pudding, Jello, whipped cream, and even fog!

Is ketchup a colloid or suspension?
-----------------------------------

Is ketchup a colloid? Ketchup is a colloid, i.e. a substance that cannot be easliy placed into either the solid, liquid or gas categories. Ketchup is in fact a sol, which is solid particles suspended in liquid.

What are the 10 examples of suspension?
---------------------------------------

What makes fog a colloid or a suspension?
-----------------------------------------

Fog is an aerosol, a type of colloid consisting of a liquid (water) dispersed in a gas (air). Furthermore, is paint a colloid or suspension?

Why does fog disappear when the sun comes out?
----------------------------------------------

Fog is a suspension of tiny liquid water droplets. When the sun comes out, the heat from the sun’s rays evaporates the water into invisible water vapor that rises into the atmosphere, hence the fog “disappears”. Where is the air suspension relay switch located?

How is fog made out of water droplets?
--------------------------------------

Fog is made out of water droplets in suspension in the air. The refractive index of these droplets is 1.3330. However the body of fog as seen on mass is opaque (enough of it will stop light) and opaque substances do not have a refractive index.

What’s the difference between a suspension and a colloid?
---------------------------------------------------------

The difference between a colloid and a suspension is that the particles will not settle to the bottom over a period of time, they will stay suspended or float. An example of a colloid is milk. Milk is a mixture of liquid butterfat globules dispersed and suspended in water.
