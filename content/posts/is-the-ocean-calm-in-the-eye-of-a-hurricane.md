Is the ocean calm in the eye of a hurricane?
--------------------------------------------

Though the eye is by far the calmest part of the storm, with no wind at the center and typically clear skies, on the ocean it is possibly the most hazardous area. In the eyewall, wind-driven waves all travel in the same direction.

Is it better to be in the eye of a hurricane?
---------------------------------------------

The greatest danger in a hurricane is in the eyewall. The worst damage is usually found where this part of the storm comes ashore.

How long does the eye of a hurricane last?
------------------------------------------

How long the eye takes to pass over you depends on the size of the eye and the speed at which the storm is moving (not the speed of the wind). So if the eye is 20 miles wide, the storm is moving at 10 miles an hour and the center passes right over you, it will take about two hours for the eye to pass.

How long can you stay in the eye of a hurricane?
------------------------------------------------

Is the eye of a hurricane a calm spot?
--------------------------------------

It is true that the eye of the storm is indeed the part of the hurricane that provides a break to you. It is a calm spot, which so much more is pronounced because just outside of the eye are the most violent storms the hurricane has to offer. Thus, the sudden calm is indeed an almost spiritual, or perhaps eerie, experience.

Is it dangerous to be in the eye of a hurricane?
------------------------------------------------

In fact, people often think the storm has passed and go outside only to be caught by the approaching eyewall. Over water, however, the eye of a hurricane is one of the most dangerous places to be. Inside the eye of a hurricane, waves are tossed around by strong winds.

Which is the calmest part of a hurricane?
-----------------------------------------

On land, the center of the eye is, by far, the calmest part of the storm, with skies mostly clear of clouds, wind and rain. Over the ocean, however, it’s possibly the most dangerous: inside, waves from all directions slam into each other, creating monster waves as tall as 130 feet (40 meters).

How long does it take to see the eye of a hurricane?
----------------------------------------------------

One satellite study found eyes detected on average for 30 hours per storm. Eyewall replacement cycles, also called concentric eyewall cycles, naturally occur in intense tropical cyclones, generally with winds greater than 185 km/h (115 mph), or major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale ).
