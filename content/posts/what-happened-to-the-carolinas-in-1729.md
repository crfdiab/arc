What happened to the Carolinas in 1729?
---------------------------------------

On July 25, 1729, North Carolina became a royal colony when the Lords Proprietors sold the colony to King George II. South Carolina had become a royal colony 10 years earlier, setting the stage for North Carolina to follow suit. During the next 40 years the colony grew rapidly.

Why did people come to the Carolinas?

The harbor and natural coastline of southern Carolina allowed easier trade with the West Indies.
