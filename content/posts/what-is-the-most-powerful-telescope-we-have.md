What is the most powerful telescope we have?
--------------------------------------------

James Webb Space Telescope  
31\. The next-generation James Webb Space Telescope will be the largest and most powerful space science observatory, according to NASA. With its infrared eyes, it will be able to study some of the oldest and most distant stars in the universe.

Is Hubble the most powerful telescope?
--------------------------------------

The Five Most Powerful Telescopes Today. Claim to Fame: By capturing iconic images such as the deep field, Crab Nebula and Eagle Nebula, Hubble has become the world’s most famous telescope. The final space shuttle mission to Hubble has encountered multiple delays, but now is planned to launch in May.

How far can the most powerful telescope on Earth see?
-----------------------------------------------------

about 10-15 billion light-years  
The farthest that Hubble has seen so far is about 10-15 billion light-years away. The farthest area looked at is called the Hubble Deep Field.

Where is the home of the most powerful telescope on Earth?
----------------------------------------------------------

These crucial advancements for the Giant Magellan Telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile will allow astronomers to see farther into space with more detail than any other optical telescope before.

What’s the farthest we’ve seen into space?
------------------------------------------

“From previous studies, the galaxy GN-z11 seems to be the farthest detectable galaxy from us, at 13.4 billion light-years, or 134 nonillion kilometers (that’s 134 followed by 30 zeros),” Kashikawa said in a statement. “But measuring and verifying such a distance is not an easy task.”

Which is the most powerful telescope in the world?
--------------------------------------------------

Built by NASA with support from the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, the James Webb Space Telescope is the infrared telescope and is known to be 100 times more powerful than the famed Hubble. It has been called the most powerful telescope ever made.

Who was the first person to invent a telescope?
-----------------------------------------------

Ever since the Hans Lippershey invented the first telescope in 1608, the telescopes have evolved tremendously to this day and age. From X-ray telescopes to atmosphere-bypassing Hubble Space Telescope to James Webb Space Telescope, the national and international space agencies have come a long way.

Which is bigger the Hubble telescope or the Webb Telescope?
-----------------------------------------------------------

About Compare Webb and Hubble Webb will be the largest telescope ever placed in space; 100 times more powerful than Hubble. So big it has to fold origami-style to fit in the rocket and will unfold like a “Transformer” in space. Webb And Hubble Folding Mirrors

Who was the greatest astronomer of all time?
--------------------------------------------

Although Isaac Newton (1642-1727) is almost universally regarded as the greatest mathematician and astronomer of all time, he never used the telescope he designed and built to make scientific discoveries, beyond improving on the design of Galileo’s telscope. Galileo used two lenses in his telescope to refract light into a focused image.
