Which group helped overthrow the provisional government?
--------------------------------------------------------

the Bolsheviks  
The Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917, when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian Provisional Government that had replaced Tsar Nicholas II.

What was overthrown by the Bolshevik Revolution?
------------------------------------------------

The situation climaxed with the October Revolution in 1917, a Bolshevik-led armed insurrection by workers and soldiers in Petrograd that successfully overthrew the Provisional Government, transferring all its authority to the Soviets. They soon relocated the national capital to Moscow.

How did communism affect Russia during the Civil War?
-----------------------------------------------------

Many communists regarded Russia as acquiring imperialist ambitions. Indeed, Moscow under the Georgian Joseph Stalin, the commissar for nationalities, regarded imperial Russia’s territory as its natural patrimony. Russia lost control of the Baltic states and Finland, however.

What was the role of the Cheka in the Civil War?
------------------------------------------------

The Cheka (a forerunner of the notorious KGB), or political police, was formed in December 1917 to protect communist power. By the end of the Civil War the Cheka had become a powerful force. Among the targets of the Cheka were Russian nationalists who objected strongly to the bolshevization of Russia.

Who was in control of Russia during the Civil War?
--------------------------------------------------

The Civil War. Only part of Russia—Moscow, Petrograd, and much of the industrial heartland—was under Bolshevik control. The countryside belonged to the Socialist Revolutionaries. Given the Bolshevik desire to dominate the whole of Russia and the rest of the former tsarist empire, civil war was inevitable.

Why was Russia in fear during the Civil War?
--------------------------------------------

There was also the question of the country’s security. Moscow lived in fear of an attack during the 1920s and concluded a number of peace treaties and nonaggression pacts with neighbouring and other countries.
