Is the Moon on the opposite side of the Sun?
--------------------------------------------

At full moon, the moon is exactly opposite the sun. This means that the moon rises just as the sun is setting, and sets just as the sun is rising. Secondly, the moon must be high enough in the sky to be visible. Because of the Earth’s rotation, the moon is above the horizon roughly 12 hours out of every 24.

What happens when the Moon is on the other side of the earth?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Well for one thing, we can also see the Earth. From this vantage point, the Moon will be full soon, but on Earth, it’s a waning crescent. The far side of the Moon has fewer of the smooth, dark spots, called maria, that cover the side that faces Earth. Instead, the far side is covered with craters of all sizes.

How come we can always see the Moon?
------------------------------------

The Moon moves around the Earth every month. The time it takes the Moon to rotate on its axis is the same time it takes to complete one trip (or “orbit”) around the Earth. This is why we always see the same side of the Moon. It also follows a similar path across the sky as the Sun.

Which is the far side of the Moon?
----------------------------------

On the far side, the Moon phases are exactly opposite from the ones we see from Earth, on the near side. When we see the Moon fully illuminated at Full Moon, the far side is in darkness. When it is New Moon here, it is Full Moon on the far side.

Why is the far side of the moon darkened during a new moon?
-----------------------------------------------------------

What is darkened depends on which phase of the Moon we see. During a new moon, the Moon lies between Earth and the Sun. So, the side we normally see from here on Earth that’s normally lit by the Sun is in its shadow. Only when the Moon is opposite from the Sun do we see that part of the surface lit up.

How does the position of the sun affect the phases of the Moon?

How does the view of the Moon change each night?
------------------------------------------------

On Earth, our view of the illuminated part of the Moon changes each night, depending on where the Moon is in its orbit, or path, around Earth. When we have a full view of the completely illuminated side of the Moon, that phase is known as a full moon.
