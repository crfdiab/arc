What happened to the city and people of Pompeii?
------------------------------------------------

Most of the Roman occupants of Herculaneum were doomed the moment Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 C.E. Within hours, a cloud of hot volcanic ash swept down the side of the famous Italian volcano, raced over the countryside, and smothered the town, along with nearby Pompeii. Hundreds died.

What happened to the city of Pompeii in 72 AD?
----------------------------------------------

Ancient Rome The blast sent a plume of ashes, pumice and other rocks, and scorching-hot volcanic gases so high into the sky that people could see it for hundreds of miles around.

Why did so many people die in the Pompeii eruption?

After the volcano first erupted shortly after noon, the thick ash turned everything black—people couldn’t even see the sun.

How did the people of Pompeii start to panic?
---------------------------------------------

It was not until the massive explosion of a large cloud of smoke, reaching 19 kilometres high, did the Pompeii people start to panic. Eventually, the large cloud started raining down debris and ash onto the city, with continuous waves of ash, named ‘pyroclastic flows’ swept across the area.
