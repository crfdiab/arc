Who were the main European powers involved in the Congress of Vienna?

How successful was the Congress of Vienna?

Why was the Congress of Vienna not a plenary session?
-----------------------------------------------------

When was the final act of the Congress of Vienna signed?
--------------------------------------------------------

Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by Napoleon’s dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the Hundred Days of March to July 1815. The Congress’s “final act” was signed nine days before his final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815.

Why was Talleyrand excluded from the Congress of Vienna?
--------------------------------------------------------

Talleyrand was thus excluded from the main work of the congress, but his protests on behalf of the smaller powers grew fainter as he realized that the “four” were not in agreement; Castlereagh and Metternich gradually won his confidence and at last insisted on Bourbon France’s being admitted to the core group.
