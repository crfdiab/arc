How do you find declination?
----------------------------

The angle between grid north and true north is called the convergence angle. To obtain the true declination it is necessary to add or subtract the convergence angle to the Grid Declination.

How do you find declination on a map?
-------------------------------------

The degrees of declination for an area are usually located on the bottom margin of the map near the north arrow, or they can be located using a declination chart.

What is the latitude of Grande Prairie?
---------------------------------------

55.1707° N, 118.7884° W  
Grande Prairie/Coordinates

What does a declination of 0 mean?
----------------------------------

Declination, in astronomy, the angular distance of a body north or south of the celestial equator. Thus, +90° declination marks the north celestial pole, 0° the celestial equator, and -90° the south celestial pole.

Do I add or subtract declination?
---------------------------------

Whenever you transfer a magnetic bearing taken in the field to your map, you add the magnetic declination to get the true bearing. Whenever you transfer a bearing taken from your map to the field, you subtract the magnetic declination to get the magnetic bearing to follow.

What parallel is Grande Prairie Alberta?
----------------------------------------

55th parallel north  
Grande Prairie is located just north of the 55th parallel north, and is 465 km (289 mi) northwest of Edmonton, lying at an elevation of 669 m (2,195 ft) above sea level.

What is the latitude of Fort Mcmurray?
--------------------------------------

56.7267° N, 111.3790° W  
Fort McMurray/Coordinates

Where on earth is there no magnetic declination?
------------------------------------------------

Earth is like a giant magnet with a North and South Pole. However, the magnetic North and South Pole are not aligned with the Geographic North and South Pole.

What is angle of declination?
-----------------------------

1 : the angle made by a descending line or plane with a horizontal plane. 2 : the angle between the direction indicated by a magnetic needle and the true meridian. — called also magnetic declination.

What is the sun’s declination today?
------------------------------------

+14° 25′ 46”  
The current Right Ascension of The Sun is 09h 34m 19s and the Declination is +14° 25′ 46” (topocentric coordinates computed for the selected location: Greenwich, United Kingdom \[change\]).
