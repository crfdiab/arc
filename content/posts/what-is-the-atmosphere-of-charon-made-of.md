What is the atmosphere of Charon made of?
-----------------------------------------

The reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins, organic macromolecules that may be essential ingredients of life. These tholins were produced from methane, nitrogen and related gases released from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred over 19,000 km (12,000 mi) to the orbiting moon.

What is special about Charon?
-----------------------------

Overview. At half the size of Pluto, Charon is the largest of Pluto’s moons and the largest known satellite relative to its parent body. Pluto-Charon is our solar system’s only known double planetary system. The same surfaces of Charon and Pluto always face each other, a phenomenon called mutual tidal locking.

Is there any atmosphere on the moon Charon?
-------------------------------------------

Charon has no Atmosphere. An artist’s conception of Pluto and its moon Charon. If you want to learn something about a place that’s billions of miles away, it helps to be in the right place at the right time. Astronomers from MIT and Williams College were lucky enough to watch as Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, passed in front of a star last summer.

How is the surface of Charon different from that of Pluto?
----------------------------------------------------------

The surface of Charon is affected by the atmosphere that Pluto sheds, giving some portions of the polar area a slight reddish color. The rest of the surface of Charon is mostly made up of water-ice and this gives it a gray-white color. Charon ha a lot more craters than Pluto and this suggests that Charon’s surface is older than Pluto.

How big is Charon compared to the Earth?
----------------------------------------

Specifically, the team found that Charon has a radius of 606 kilometers, “plus or minus 8 kilometers to account for local topography or possible non-sphericity in Charon’s shape,” Gulbis said. That size, combined with mass measurements from Hubble Space Telescope data, show that the moon has a density roughly one-third that of the Earth.

When was Charon discovered in the Solar System?
-----------------------------------------------

Charon was discovered in 1978 when sharp-eyed astronomer James Christy noticed images of Pluto were strangely elongated. The blob seemed to move around Pluto.
