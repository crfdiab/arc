What is the term for pollution that comes from multiple sources?
----------------------------------------------------------------

NPS pollution, unlike pollution from industrial and sewage treatment plants, comes from many diffuse sources. NPS pollution is caused by rainfall or snowmelt moving over and through the ground.

Are cars nonpoint sources of pollution?
---------------------------------------

Nonpoint source air pollution affects air quality, from sources such as smokestacks or car tailpipes. This runoff is often classified as a type of NPS pollution.

What are the different types of water pollution?
------------------------------------------------

Water pollution is categorized into a point source, non-point source, and groundwater. Point source water pollution occurs when the contaminants enter a water body from a single identifiable source while non-point source occurs as a result of the cumulative effects of different amounts of contaminants.

Which is an example of a naturally occurring pollutant?
-------------------------------------------------------

Pollutants, the elements of pollution, can be foreign substances or energies, or naturally occurring; when naturally occurring, they are considered contaminants when they exceed natural levels. Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution.

Which is the best description of point source pollution?
--------------------------------------------------------

Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution. POINT SOURCE POLLUTION. A point source of pollution is a single identifiable localized source of air, water, thermal, noise or light pollution. A point source has negligible extent, distinguishing it from other pollution source geometries.

Where does the majority of air pollution come from?
---------------------------------------------------

Types of Sources. Stationary sources, like power plants, emit large amounts of pollution from a single location, these are also known as point sources of pollution. Area sources are made up of lots of smaller pollution sources that arenâ€™t a big deal by themselves but when considered as a group can be.
