What is the mineral that contains silicon and oxygen?
-----------------------------------------------------

silicates  
Quartz falls into a group of minerals called the silicates, all of which contain the elements silicon and oxygen in some proportion. Silicates are by far the most common minerals in Earth’s crust and mantle, making up 95% of the crust and 97% of the mantle by most estimates.

What is silicon and oxygen together?
------------------------------------

silicate minerals …all silicate structures is the silicon-oxygen (SiO4)4– tetrahedron. It is composed of a central silicon cation (Si4+) bonded to four oxygen atoms that are located at the corners of a regular tetrahedron. The terrestrial crust is held together by the strong silicon-oxygen bonds of these tetrahedrons.

How do we identify minerals?
----------------------------

Using Characteristics of Minerals to Identify Them. Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.

What is the largest mineral group?
----------------------------------

Silicates  
Silicates are the largest mineral group. About 1,000 silicate minerals are known. Silicate minerals are also extremely common. They make up over 90% of Earth’s crust!

What is the purest form of silicon?
-----------------------------------

Quartz  
Quartz is the crystalline form of Silica and hence is the purest form of Silica.

What is silicon used for?
-------------------------

Silicon is one of the most useful elements to mankind. Most is used to make alloys including aluminium-silicon and ferro-silicon (iron-silicon). These are used to make dynamo and transformer plates, engine blocks, cylinder heads and machine tools and to deoxidise steel. Silicon is also used to make silicones.

What are the six mineral groups?
--------------------------------

Patrick H. There are 7 major mineral groups: Silicates, Oxides, Sulfates, Sulfides, Carbonates, Native Elements, and Halides.

Which is silicate mineral makes up most rocks?
----------------------------------------------

Minerals that contain silicon and oxygen are called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Which silicate mineral makes up most rocks? Which silicate mineral breaks easily into sheets? Which silicate mineral is the basic building block of many rocks?

What kind of minerals are found on Earth?
-----------------------------------------

contains oxygen and carbon, softer than fluorite, harder than gypsum, fizzes when in contact with an acid. calcite. silicate, main component of most rocks on Earth’s surface. feldspar. contains silicon and oxygen, basic building block of many rocks. quartz. contains oxygen and silicon, biotite is one kind, breaks easily into sheets. mica.

Is the color of a mineral called the mineral’s streak?
------------------------------------------------------

The color of a mineral when it is a powder is called the mineral’s \_\_\_\_\_\_. What is a mineral’s streak? Why is using a mineral’s streak more reliable than using color to identify a mineral?

What do you call a pure mineral deposit?
----------------------------------------

A mineral deposit large and pure enough to be mined for profit is called a (n) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. What are two methods by which rocks and minerals are removed from the ground? Give an example of a type of surface mine.
