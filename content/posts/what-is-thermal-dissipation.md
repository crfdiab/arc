What is thermal dissipation?
----------------------------

Heat dissipation is a type of heat transfer. Heat dissipation occurs when an object that is hotter than other objects is placed in an environment where the heat of the hotter object is transferred to the colder objects and the surrounding environment.

What are the ways in which heat can dissipate?
----------------------------------------------

Top 5 ways body heat is lost

- Evaporation – Body heat turns sweat into vapor.
- Convection – Heat loss by air or water moving across the skin surface.
- Conduction – Direct contact with an object.
- Radiation – The body radiates (like a fire — you can feel heat without being inside the fire).

How do you dissipate heat in a circuit?
---------------------------------------

PCB Design Techniques to Dissipate Heat

1. Large metal pads under hot parts to act as a “thermal” pad.
2. Solid filled vias to conduct heat from thermal pads into ground planes.
3. Heat sinks connected to thermal pads of hot parts.
4. Using board materials with better thermal properties such as polyimides or metal core boards.

What is dissipation of energy?
------------------------------

Dissipation is a term that is often used to describe ways in which energy is wasted. Any energy that is not transferred to useful energy stores is said to be wasted because it is lost to the surroundings. Electrical cables warming up are a good example of this.

What is the ideal condition for thermal dissipation?
----------------------------------------------------

Correct Answer : Heat generated = Heat Dissipated.

What are the 4 methods of heat loss?
------------------------------------

There are four avenues of heat loss: convection, conduction, radiation, and evaporation. If skin temperature is greater than that of the surroundings, the body can lose heat by radiation and conduction.

How do you stop a PCB from overheating?
---------------------------------------

Designers often reduce thermal resistance by:

1. Using a thinner PCB to reduce the thermal path.
2. Adding thermal vias for vertical heat conduction.
3. Copper foil and thick tracks for horizontal heat conduction.

How much heat can a resistor dissipate?
---------------------------------------

The resistor is dissipating 400 mW, so its temperature rise will be about (400 mW)(200 °C/W) = 80 °C. If it’s on a open board on your desk, you can probably figure 25 °C maximum ambient, so the resistor could get to 105 °C. Note that’s hot enough to boil water, but most resistors will be fine at this temperature.

Where is the highest rate of unwanted energy in a house?
--------------------------------------------------------

The roof and windows are the hottest, showing that most heat is lost from the house through those parts. Heat energy is transferred from homes by conduction through the walls, floor, roof and windows.

What is an example of dissipated energy?
----------------------------------------

Examples of dissipation Energy is usually lost by heating up the surroundings though sometimes energy is dissipated as sound waves. for a radio or set of speakers, the electrical work is transferred into useful sound waves and infrared radiation is dissipated – ie wasted as heat energy.

What happens to oil flow during thermal breakdown?
--------------------------------------------------

The viscosity change caused by thermal breakdown results in decreased oil flow, which can eventually lead to increased oil consumption, deposit buildup and damage to the engine’s metal surfaces. What is viscosity breakdown? Viscosity breakdown is essentially the very same thing as thermal breakdown.

How is viscosity breakdown similar to thermal breakdown?
--------------------------------------------------------

Viscosity breakdown is essentially the very same thing as thermal breakdown. As a vehicle becomes hotter and hotter, the oil’s viscosity changes. That reduces the oil flow and causes a number of problems throughout the engine and its associated parts. What temperature does oil break down at?

What happens when a car has thermal breakdown?
----------------------------------------------

Well, lots of things, and none of ’em good. Thermal breakdown is among the most damaging effects, and occurs when a car’s internal heat causes a chemical reaction in the motor oil, which causes the oil’s viscosity to change.

Which is the best way to prevent thermal breakdown?
---------------------------------------------------

The hotter the engine’s temperatures, the more drastically and quickly an oil will degrade, but higher quality oils have better resistance to temperature-induced changes. However, the best step to prevent thermal breakdown is following the car manufacturer’s recommended oil change interval. Heated up for more car maintenance tips?
