How many voltages are in a house?
---------------------------------

Most houses today have two 110 volt wires and one neutral wire running into the house from the local distribution system. These wires can run underground or above ground. If there are two 110 volt wires running to the house, then the house has 220 volt service and appliances, such as dryers and air conditioners.

What is the normal voltage in a house?
--------------------------------------

In much of the world, a voltage (nominally) of 230 volts and frequency of 50 Hz is used. In North America, the most common combination is 120 V and a frequency of 60 Hz. Other combinations exist, for example, 230 V at 60 Hz. Travellers’ portable appliances may be inoperative or damaged by foreign electrical supplies.

How do I know if my house is 220V?
----------------------------------

yourminky. crutschow said: If it has 220V, there will be three wires from the power line to your electrical panel, two hot and one neutral. Measuring across the two hot leads, should give you 220V.

What voltage is too high for homes?
-----------------------------------

Normally, you should measure about 115–125 volts between either hot pole and neutral, and 230–250 volts between the two hot poles.) A voltage of 135 is way too high and can cause damage. This is a dangerous condition.

Is 240 volts High voltage?
--------------------------

These classifications can be combined into the categories below: High (HV), Extra- High (EHV) &amp; Ultra-High Voltages (UHV) – 115,000 to 1,100,000 VAC. Medium Voltage (MV) – 2,400 to 69,000 VAC. Low Voltage (LV) – 240 to 600 VAC.

What kind of voltage does Saudi Arabia use?
-------------------------------------------

Special Notes for Saudi Arabia. Electricity in Saudi Arabia is 127 Volts, alternating at 60 cycles per second. If you travel to Saudi Arabia with a device that does not accept 127 Volts at 60 Hertz, you will need a voltage converter. There are three main types of voltage converter.
