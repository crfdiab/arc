What type of radiation is released in a nuclear explosion?
----------------------------------------------------------

The release of radiation is a phenomenon unique to nuclear explosions. There are several kinds of radiation emitted; these types include gamma, neutron, and ionizing radiation, and are emitted not only at the time of detonation (initial radiation) but also for long periods of time afterward (residual radiation).

What happens to the human body in a nuclear explosion?
------------------------------------------------------

The blast can injure the human body through effects such as rupturing ear drums or lungs, or by throwing people at dangerous speeds. A nuclear blast can also lead to many long term effects on human health, and can cause cataracts, thyroid disease, birth defects and cancer.

What causes radioactive fallout?
--------------------------------

Radioactive fallout is radioactive material produced by a nuclear explosion or a nuclear reactor accident that enters the atmosphere and eventually falls to Earth. This fallout consists of minute, radioactive particles of dust, soil, and other debris.

What are the four basic effects of a nuclear detonation?
--------------------------------------------------------

Nuclear explosions produce both immediate and delayed destructive effects. Blast, thermal radiation, and prompt ionizing radiation cause significant destruction within seconds or minutes of a nuclear detonation.

Why nuclear testing is bad?
---------------------------

In terms of human exposure, the increase in the thyroidal cancer incidence in many areas of the globe (strongly affected by the radioactive contamination with the 131I radionuclide) is the one among the worst consequences of nuclear testing.

What kind of radiation is released from a nuclear explosion?
------------------------------------------------------------

What are the effects of fallout from a nuclear detonation?
----------------------------------------------------------

External radiation exposure from fallout represents the greatest preventable injury after a nuclear detonation. The earliest priority of any population monitoring activity is identification and care of individuals whose health is in immediate danger (from trauma or serious medical disorders) and who require urgent care.

What are the different types of nuclear radiation?
--------------------------------------------------

Nuclear Radiation The release of radiation is a phenomenon unique to nuclear explosions. There are several kinds of radiation emitted; these types include gamma, neutron, and ionizing radiation, and are emitted not only at the time of detonation (initial radiation) but also for long periods of time afterward (residual radiation).

How are gamma rays used in nuclear fallout?
-------------------------------------------

Gamma rays in fallout are photons emitted by radionuclides. Like x-rays from machines, gamma rays from radionuclides can “shine” through (penetrate) clothing, walls, protective suits, cars, and inadequate shelters.
