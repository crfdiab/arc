What particle was first?
------------------------

electron  
Enter your search terms: The first subatomic particle to be discovered was the electron, identified in 1897 by J. J. Thomson. After the nucleus of the atom was discovered in 1911 by Ernest Rutherford, the nucleus of ordinary hydrogen was recognized to be a single proton.

Which subatomic particle has just been discovered?
--------------------------------------------------

All of these have now been discovered by experiments, with the latest being the top quark (1995), tau neutrino (2000), and Higgs boson (2012). Various extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of an elementary graviton particle and many other elementary particles, but none have been discovered as of 2021.

Why were electrons the first subatomic particle to be discovered?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The first subatomic particle to be discovered was the electron. The charge-to-mass ratio was found to be relatively large, and independent of the gas used in his experiments, which indicated to him that he had found a true particle. Thomson gave it the name “corpuscle,” which was later changed to “electron.”

What is the order of subatomic particles?
-----------------------------------------

Atom Composition Particles that are smaller than the atom are called subatomic particles. The three main subatomic particles that form an atom are protons, neutrons, and electrons. The center of the atom is called the nucleus.

Who was the first scientist to discover a subatomic particle?
-------------------------------------------------------------

In 1896 the French physicist Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity, and in the following year J.J. Thomson, a professor of physics at the University of Cambridge in England, demonstrated the existence of tiny particles much smaller in mass than hydrogen, the lightest atom. Thomson had discovered the first subatomic particle, the electron.

Who was the first to discover elementary particles?

How are electrons and protons classified as subatomic particles?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Electrons are negatively charged subatomic particles An equal number of electrons and protons are found in the atoms of all elements. J. Thompson is credited with the discovery of electrons since he was the first person to accurately calculate the mass and the charge on an electron.

Are there any subatomic particles in the standard model?
--------------------------------------------------------

All of these have now been discovered by experiments, with the latest being the top quark (1995), tau neutrino (2000), and Higgs boson (2012). Various extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of an elementary graviton particle and many other elementary particles, but none have been discovered as of 2019.
