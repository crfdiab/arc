What effect do clouds dust and air molecules like ozone have on sunlight traveling through the atmosphere?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ozone. Ozone in the lower part of the atmosphere acts as a greenhouse gas and is a major pollutant. Higher up, in the stratosphere, the ozone layer absorbs solar ultra-violet radiation and affects how much of the Sun’s heat is radiated back into space.

How do clouds affect solar radiation?
-------------------------------------

Clouds warm the Earth by absorbing infrared radiation emitted from the surface and reradiating it back down. Clouds reflect about 50 W m-2 of solar radiation up into space, and radiate about 30 W m-2 down to the ground, so the net effect is 20 W m-2 cooling on average.

What happens when radiant energy reaches the atmosphere?
--------------------------------------------------------

Once the sun’s energy reaches earth, it is intercepted first by the atmosphere. A small part of the sun’s energy is directly absorbed, particularly by certain gases such as ozone and water vapor. Some of the sun’s energy is reflected back to space by clouds and the earth’s surface.

How does radiation affect the atmosphere?
-----------------------------------------

Radiation from the warmed upper atmosphere, along with a small amount from the Earth’s surface, radiates out to space. Most of the emitted longwave radiation warms the lower atmosphere, which in turn warms our planet’s surface.

Do clouds scattered solar radiation?
------------------------------------

Low, thick clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth. High, thin clouds primarily transmit incoming solar radiation; at the same time, they trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and radiate it back downward, thereby warming the surface of the Earth.

How much of the sun’s energy actually reaches the Earth?
--------------------------------------------------------

One one-billionth of the Sun’s total energy output actually reaches the Earth. Of all the energy that does reach Earth, slightly less than 34 percent is reflected back to space by clouds. The Earth itself reflects another 66 percent back to space.

How does the Earth lose energy?
-------------------------------

Balancing Act Since Earth is surrounded by the vacuum of outer space, it cannot lose energy through conduction or convection. Instead, the only way the Earth loses energy to space is by electromagnetic radiation.

How does radiation affect climate?
----------------------------------

Researchers have shown that UV radiation affects climate through direct heating and the production and destruction of ozone in the stratosphere, which then leads to regional effects at Earth’s surface through a complex chain of mechanisms.

Who was one of the first scientists to realize the effects of co2 in the atmosphere?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was a Swedish scientist that was the first to claim in 1896 that fossil fuel combustion may eventually result in enhanced global warming. He proposed a relation between atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and temperature.
