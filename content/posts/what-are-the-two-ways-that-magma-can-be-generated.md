What are the two ways that magma can be generated?
--------------------------------------------------

Magma is formed by both wet and dry melting processes. By melting different parts of the layers of the earth, basaltic, rhyolitic and andesitic magma will be formed.

What is the best way to generate magma?
---------------------------------------

Three ways to Generate Magmas The geothermal gradient can be raised by upwelling of hot material from below either by uprise solid material (decompression melting) or by intrusion of magma (heat transfer). Lowering the melting temperature can be achieved by adding water or Carbon Dioxide (flux melting).

What are the three ways that magma can form?
--------------------------------------------

The three ways that magma can be formed are through heat transfer, decompression melting and flux melting. The process of magma creation is referred to by geologists as magmagenesis and occurs at the upper mantle of the Earth’s crust due to plate tectonic effects. Heat transfer is…

How is magma formed in the upper mantle?
----------------------------------------

The three ways that magma can be formed are through heat transfer, decompression melting and flux melting. The process of magma creation is referred to by geologists as magmagenesis and occurs at the upper mantle of the Earth’s crust due to plate tectonic effects.

How does magma generation occur in a continental arc?
-----------------------------------------------------

Silicic magmas forming large plutons in continental arcs are largely a result of melting of the crust by heat released from a stagnant basalt magma underplate. Magma generation beneath MORs occurs through decompression melting of upwelling mantle in response to plate separation.

How is magma produced at mid ocean ridges?
------------------------------------------

This uplifting of the ocean floor occurs when convection currents rise in the mantle beneath the oceanic crust and create magma where two tectonic plates meet at a divergent boundary. Click to see full answer. Similarly, it is asked, how is magma generated at mid ocean ridges and what is the composition of this magma?
