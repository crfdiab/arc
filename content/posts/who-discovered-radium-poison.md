Who discovered radium poison?
-----------------------------

Marie Curie soon realized the potential dangers of her new discovery, and helped put an end to this harmful profession. Radium was used to cure cancers for decades before finally being declared unsafe in 1976 and gradually replaced with iridium 192 and caesium 137 for brachytherapies.

How did radium discovered?
--------------------------

Radium was discovered in 1898 by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie. They managed to extract 1 mg of radium from ten tonnes of the uranium ore pitchblende (uranium oxide, U3O8), a considerable feat, given the chemically methods of separation available to them.

Who discovered radium in 1898?
------------------------------

Maria Sklodowska-Curie  
The discovery of radium in 1898 by Maria Sklodowska-Curie (1867-1934) and Pierre Curie (1859-1906) with commentary on their life and times.

What color is radium?
---------------------

silvery white  
Radium is the heaviest alkaline earth metal, according to Encyclopedia. The other alkali earth metals include beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium. Radium changes from a silvery white color to black when exposed to air, according to Lenntech due to oxidation.

What was radium first used for?
-------------------------------

According to Chemistry Explained, radium is extracted today from uranium ores in much the same way that Marie and Pierre Curie did in the late 1890s and early 1900s. According to Periodic Table, radium was used in clocks to paint the numbers and the hands so that they were visible in the dark.

Who was the first radium girl to die?
-------------------------------------

Frances Splettstocher  
Frances Splettstocher, a woman in her early twenties, was the first to die in the Waterbury Radium Girls tragedy. She suffered the common symptoms and ailments of radium poisoning, such as: anemia, sore throat, deteriorating jaw, soft teeth, spontaneous bone fractures, and aches.

Does radium really glow?
------------------------

Radium by itself glows weakly, so it’s combined with a phosphor in radioluminescent paint – almost invariably, zinc sulfide, which is often combined with a “doping” metal to give a specific color.

Who was the first person to discover radium?
--------------------------------------------

Its atomic number is 88 and it is denoted by the symbol Ra. It is pure white alkaline earth metal. In 1898, radium was discovered by Polish–French physicist–chemist Madame Marie Sklodowska Curie and a French physicist Pierre Curie. Marie Curie won two Noble Prizes for her great works for chemistry and physics.

When did Marie and Pierre Curie isolate radium?
-----------------------------------------------

Curies isolate radium. On April 20, 1902, Marie and Pierre Curie successfully isolate radioactive radium salts from the mineral pitchblende in their laboratory in Paris. In 1898, the Curies discovered the existence of the elements radium and polonium in their research of pitchblende. One year after isolating radium,…

Who was the first director of the Warsaw Radium Institute?
----------------------------------------------------------

She eventually became the first director of Warsaw’s Maria Skłodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology, then known as the Warsaw Radium Institute. Of course, Bronisława also got married and while she invited her little sister Marie to finish her studies with them in Paris, Marie had to be partially helped by their father to pay the steep tuition.

What was the name of the element that the Curies discovered?
------------------------------------------------------------

Following on Becquerel, the Curies succeeded in isolating element 84, polonium (named for Poland, the country of Marie’s birth), and then element 88, radium.
