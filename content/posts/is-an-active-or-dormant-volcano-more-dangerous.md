Is an active or dormant volcano more dangerous?
-----------------------------------------------

Each categorisation has different levels of risk associated with it. For example, extinct volcanoes have almost no danger, but dormant and active ones aren’t so safe (because, again, they may erupt at any time). But, in general, it’s true that even minor volcanic activity can cause dangerous earthquakes and mudslides.

Can a dormant volcano change to an active volcano?
--------------------------------------------------

Even dormant volcanoes are becoming active and not only that, but also extinct volcanoes are coming back to life. An extinct volcano by definition is dead volcano, which has not erupted in the last 10,000 years and is not expected to ever erupt again.

How long does a volcano have to be inactive to be considered dormant?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

10,000 years  
A dormant volcano is an active volcano that is not erupting, but supposed to erupt again. An extinct volcano has not had an eruption for at least 10,000 years and is not expected to erupt again in a comparable time scale of the future.

What is dangerous about being close to a dormant volcano that isn’t currently erupting?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While extinct volcanoes pose virtually no threat, the others might not be so safe. Volcanoes are often covered with ash and debris. Because of this, stratovolcanoes are known for causing deadly mudslides (sometimes called lahars). These can be the result of volcanic activity, earthquakes, or even rainfall.

What’s the difference between an extinct volcano and a dormant volcano?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A dormant volcano is an active volcano that is not erupting, but supposed to erupt again. An extinct volcano has not had an eruption for at least 10,000 years and is not expected to erupt again in a comparable time scale of the future.

How can you tell if a volcano is active or dormant?
---------------------------------------------------

In short, knowing if a volcano is active, dormant, or extinct is complicated and all comes down to timing. And when it comes to geological features, timing is quite difficult for us mere mortals. Individuals and generations have limited life spans, nations rise and fall, and even entire civilization sometimes bite the dust.

Can a volcano still be active after 3 years?
--------------------------------------------

So, we can probably consider Tongariro “dormant” again after 3+ years of being an “active” volcano. However, it is surprising for most people to hear that there are no hard-and-fast definitions for what a volcano is considered active, dormant or extinct.

Are there any active volcanoes in the world?
--------------------------------------------

Volcanoes believed to be extinct around the world include: Zuidwal Volcano (Netherlands); Emperor-Seamount chain (Hawaii, United States); and Mount Kulal (Kenya). When Is A Volcano Considered Active, Dormant, Or Extinct? Volcanoes are classified as active, dormant, or extinct based on their activity since the last Ice Age.
