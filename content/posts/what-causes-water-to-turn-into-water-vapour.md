What causes water to turn into water vapour?
--------------------------------------------

This container and the water within it is kept at a constant temperature. Some the water liquid molecules will have enough kinetic energy to overcome the attraction of their neighbouring water liquid molecules and escape from water liquid surface and become water vapour.

What happens to liquid water during the evaporation process?
------------------------------------------------------------

It is the invisible process of evaporation that changes liquid and frozen water into water-vapor gas, which then floats up into the skies to become clouds. Note: This section of the Water Science School discusses the Earth’s “natural” water cycle without human interference.

How are water molecules arranged in the vapor form?
---------------------------------------------------

Water molecules in the vapor form are arranged more randomly than in liquid water. As condensation occurs and liquid water forms from the vapor, the water molecules become more organized and heat is released into the atmosphere as a result.

What happens when water vapor is higher in the sky?
---------------------------------------------------

Higher in the sky where it is colder than at the land surface, invisible water vapor condenses into tiny liquid water droplets—clouds. When the cloud droplets combine to form heavier cloud drops which can no longer “float” in the surrounding air, it can start to rain, snow, and hail… all forms of precipitation, the superhighway moving water…

How does water vapor get back to the Earth?
-------------------------------------------

It condenses into clouds, is blown by the wind, and then falls back to the Earth as rain or snow. This cycle is one important way that heat and energy are transferred from the surface of the Earth to the atmosphere, and transported from one place to another on our planet.

Where does the heat from water vapor go?
----------------------------------------

Heat radiated from Earth’s surface is absorbed by water vapor molecules in the lower atmosphere. The water vapor molecules, in turn, radiate heat in all directions. Some of the heat returns to the Earth’s surface.
