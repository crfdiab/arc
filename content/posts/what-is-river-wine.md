Why are vineyards near rivers?
------------------------------

In the Duero valley on the Iberian peninsula, rivers fulfill the opposite function by cooling hot, arid vineyards responsible for exalted Tempranillos and rich red blends.

What type of wine is Margaret River known for?

Why is Margaret River good for wine?
------------------------------------

Margaret River soils are predominantly deep, well-drained, red gravelly loams. Over time, the ridge has created a complex network of gneiss, schist and granite-based soils, the oldest in the world.

Why are vineyards always on hills?

What does it mean when a wine is dry?
-------------------------------------

Our Guide To Dry Wines. A dry wine is simply a wine that has no residual sugar, meaning it isn’t sweet. When grape juice converts to wine, alcohol is produced in the fermentation process because yeast eats the sugar present in the juice. In many wines, the winemaker stops the fermentation process before the yeast has time…

How does a winemaker make a dry wine?
-------------------------------------

To make a dry wine, the winemaker will instead let the fermentation process finish completely, allowing the yeast to consume all the sugar present. No more sugar, so no sugary sweetness; the wine is therefore dry. Tip! Do not confuse the absence of sweetness or dryness with the absence of fruit.
