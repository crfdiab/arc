What coral does to the environment?
-----------------------------------

Coral reefs protect coastlines from storms and erosion, provide jobs for local communities, and offer opportunities for recreation. They are also are a source of food and new medicines. Over half a billion people depend on reefs for food, income, and protection. Corals are already a gift.

Why is coral considered a good indicator of changes in the environment?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Corals provide food and shelter for many forms of life, and are essential to the marine ecosystem. Corals are also the most obvious indicators of any deadly environmental change, particularly as a result of increased seawater temperatures of as much as 2 degrees over the average, over a period of 2 to 4 weeks.

What do corals tell us?
-----------------------

By using corals to determine the past climate in the tropical oceans, scientists can also predict future trends in the climate system. El Niño, which is spawned in the Pacific Ocean, greatly affects weather from Asia and Australia to North and South America.

How does coral affect the climate?
----------------------------------

When conditions such as the temperature change, corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, responsible for their colour. A spike of 1–2°C in ocean temperatures sustained over several weeks can lead to bleaching, turning corals white. If corals are bleached for prolonged periods, they eventually die.

Why do we need coral?
---------------------

Coral reefs provide an important ecosystem for life underwater, protect coastal areas by reducing the power of waves hitting the coast, and provide a crucial source of income for millions of people. More than 500 million people worldwide depend on reefs for food, jobs and coastal defence.

Is coral a Bioindicator?
------------------------

Coral, more so than many other organisms, are sensitive to tiny changes in the marine environment, which makes them an excellent bioindicator of changing environmental conditions.

What causes corals to glow?
---------------------------

The university’s scientists found that glowing colours in bleached corals act like a protective layer (similar to sunscreen) when symbiotic micro-algae are lost. The stress causes them to expel the microscopic symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, which reside within their tissues.

What can corals tell us about the environment?
----------------------------------------------

Corals have the potential to record several centuries of highly detailed environmental information in the form of chemical proxies such as trace elements and stable isotopes. They are fantastic sources for isotopes as their calcified skeletons are formed at or near to isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding seawater.

How does the climate affect the coral reef?
-------------------------------------------

Times of environmental stress, including disease outbreaks or bleaching—when a coral animal expels the symbiotic algae that lives within it and gives it its color—can also be identified within the banding. Such markers help scientists determine extreme climate conditions that are harmful to the reef.

How does the bleaching of coral reefs affect the environment?
-------------------------------------------------------------

A full global accounting of how many corals have survived the latest bleaching episode will take months, if not longer, but coral scientists expect the worst. The consequences of losing coral reefs are catastrophic for the oceans. There’s a reason scientists describe reefs as the rainforests of the sea.

How can scientists tell how old coral reefs are?
------------------------------------------------

From the time the coral forms until the uranium decay evens out a few hundred thousand years later, scientists can tell exactly how old the coral is by measuring how much thorium it contains. This gives them a timeframe to relate to other climate records.
