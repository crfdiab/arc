Is a river delta weathering or erosion?
---------------------------------------

Unlike other landforms affected by water current, a delta is not mainly created because of erosion of land surface caused by the force of wind and water. As the river channel flows over the ground and makes contact with soil, it carries with it sediments like gravel, sand, silt and clay.

What type of delta morphology does the Nile river have?
-------------------------------------------------------

Triangular delta  
The rate of flow, the type of sediment and the action of tides can all affect the formation of a delta. As regards its morphology, a delta may be distinguished between Triangular delta in shape (Nile River) and Bird’s foot delta (Mississippi River).

What is the delta of the Nile river called?
-------------------------------------------

The Nile Delta (Arabic: دلتا النيل‎ Delta an-Nīl or simply الدلتا ad-Delta) is the delta formed in Lower Egypt where the Nile River spreads out and drains into the Mediterranean Sea.

How did the delta form in the Nile River?
-----------------------------------------

A delta is a land form comprised of sediments found at the mouth of the river. A delta can only form when river channels carry sediments into another body of water. Herodotus, a Greek historian, first used the term “delta” for the Nile River in Egypt.

How does erosion affect the shape of a river delta?
---------------------------------------------------

In such deltas, wave action deflects much of sediment at the river mouth along the coastline. Waves also cause deltas to retract by removing sediments from the river mouth. In tide-dominated deltas, tides control the shape of the delta. Erosion plays a significant role in shaping such deltas.

How does biological weathering occur in a river?
------------------------------------------------

Biological weathering occurs due to the penetration and expansion of plant roofs, earth worms, burrowing animals (rabbits, rats) and same human activities. Question 3. Mention the three courses of a river with any two land forms associated to each course. The lower course – Delta and Estuary. Question 4. What are Ox-bow lakes?

Why are deltas formed at the mouths of rivers?
----------------------------------------------

The deltas formed due to filling of estuaries of rivers are called estuarine deltas. Those mouths of the rivers are called estuaries which are submerged under marine water and sea waves and oceanic currents remove the sediments brought by the rivers.
