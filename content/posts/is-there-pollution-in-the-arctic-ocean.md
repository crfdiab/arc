Is there pollution in the Arctic Ocean?
---------------------------------------

In the summer when the ice melts, the toxins get washed into the sea and rivers. The main contaminants in the Arctic region are heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as DDT, PCBs and dioxins, which evaporate into the air but are slow to degrade.

How much plastic is in the Arctic Ocean?
----------------------------------------

Experts calculated that, Arctic-wide, there were around 40 microplastic particles per cubic meter of water (equivalent to 1.13 particles per cubic foot). Synthetic fibers were the dominant source of microplastics at 92.3%, with the majority consisting of polyester.

How pollution is affecting the Arctic?
--------------------------------------

A study by atmospheric scientists has found that the air in the Arctic is extraordinarily sensitive to air pollution, and that particulate matter may spur Arctic cloud formation. These clouds can act as a blanket, further warming an already-changing Arctic.

Does snow have plastic?
-----------------------

It’s snowing plastic. This is the year we found microplastic in the snow. The finding implies that there are significant amounts of microplastics in the air, indicating that it could be considered a form of air pollution. …

Why is there so much pollution in the Arctic Ocean?
---------------------------------------------------

The Arctic Ocean basin acts like a reservoir or ‘sink’ for industrial and agricultural chemicals from Europe, Asia and even further afield which are transported there in the air and ocean currents. The cold temperatures and ice bound environment trap the toxics in the ground, air, water and ice where they degrade extremely slowly.

Where are plastics found in the Arctic Ocean?
---------------------------------------------

Currents, streams, waves and wind carry marine litter across the seas, while solid waste and wastewater from Arctic communities, and larger communities up-river, contribute to the problem. Plastic debris is found on Arctic beaches, in the water column, in sea ice, sediments and even in the bodies of Arctic birds and mammals.

What are the effects of pollutants on polar bears?
--------------------------------------------------

Impacts on the hormone and immune systems, reduced reproduction and increased offspring mortality are some of the effects found in the polar bear , glaucous gull, arctic char and harp seal. Impaired immune system and reduced reproduction show that far-transported pollutants affect populations of arctic animals.

How much of the Arctic Ocean is covered in ice?
-----------------------------------------------

Much of the Arctic Ocean is covered by sea ice that varies in extent and thickness seasonally. The mean extent of the ice has been decreasing since 1980 from the average winter value of 15,600,000 km 2 (6,023,200 sq mi) at a rate of 3% per decade.
