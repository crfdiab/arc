What is the meaning of tectonic activity?
-----------------------------------------

According to the theory, the Earth’s crust is made up of continental and oceanic plates, which move across the surface of the planet, meeting at plate boundaries. Plate tectonics cause volcanic activity, mountain-building, ocean trench formation and earthquakes.

What is tectonic activity short answer?
---------------------------------------

A tectonic plate (also called lithospheric plate) is a massive, irregularly shaped slab of solid rock, generally composed of both continental and oceanic lithosphere. Plate size can vary greatly, from a few hundred to thousands of kilometers across; the Pacific and Antarctic Plates are among the largest.

What are the types of tectonic activities?
------------------------------------------

Most geologic activity stems from the interplay where the plates meet or divide. The movement of the plates creates three types of tectonic boundaries: convergent, where plates move into one another; divergent, where plates move apart; and transform, where plates move sideways in relation to each other.

What is the importance of having an active tectonic activity?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Plate activity on Earth has helped to regulate the level of carbon dioxide over the eons. The same weathering that pulls nutrients from mountaintops down into the oceans also helps to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Where does tectonic activity occur?
-----------------------------------

plate boundaries  
Tectonic activity occurs around plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are areas on Earth where two crustal plates meet each other.

Which is the best definition of tectonic activity?
--------------------------------------------------

The Definition of Tectonic Activity. Plate tectonics is a geological theory that explains the phenomenon of continental drift. According to the theory, the Earth’s crust is made up of continental and oceanic plates, which move across the surface of the planet, meeting at plate boundaries.

How to do plate tectonics activities for kids?
----------------------------------------------

Have them place two cracker squares in the frosting and follow the guidelines below to recreate four plate movements showing the effect of each on the Earth’s crust. To recreate the transform boundary, place the two crackers together and then slide them back and forth against each other.

How does the theory of plate tectonics work?
--------------------------------------------

What is plate tectonics? Plate tectonics is the theory that Earth’s outer shell is divided into several plates that glide over the mantle, the rocky inner layer above the core. The plates act like a hard and rigid shell compared to Earth’s mantle.

How does volcanic activity affect the tectonic plate?
-----------------------------------------------------

These hot spot s are able to independently melt the tectonic plate above them, creating magma that erupts onto the top of the plate. In hot spots beneath the ocean, the tectonic activity creates a volcanic mound. Over millions of years, volcanic mounds can grow until they reach sea level and create a volcanic island.
