Can the Mars rover move?
------------------------

The rovers were designed to trek up to 100 meters (about 110 yards or 328 feet) across the martian surface each martian day, though they have gone much farther. That means the rovers have to be able to move quickly and effectively. …

How does the Mars rover turn?
-----------------------------

The Perseverance rover has six wheels, each with its own individual motor. The two front and two rear wheels also have individual steering motors. This steering capability allows the vehicle to turn in place, a full 360 degrees. The four-wheel steering also allows the rover to swerve and curve, making arcing turns.

Has the Mars rover woken up?
----------------------------

Minders on Earth prepared to let Opportunity hunker down for the dust storm, the worst such event ever witnessed in the more than four decades robots have been occupying Mars. On June 10 the rover woke up briefly, but its energy was too low to send a message home, and it fell silent.

Can the Mars rover repair itself?
---------------------------------

We do this because we know there’s no way we can repair anything about the rover once it leaves earth mainly because we have no way of dealing with structural damage (since the rover can’t repair itself and there’s no one there to repair it).

How big is the Rover going to be on Mars?
-----------------------------------------

The Mars 2020 rover, Perseverance, is based on the Mars Science Laboratory ‘s Curiosity rover configuration. It is car-sized, about 10 feet long (not including the arm), 9 feet wide, and 7 feet tall (about 3 meters long, 2.7 meters wide, and 2.2 meters tall).

How is the helicopter going to be on Mars?
------------------------------------------

The helicopter will be carried to Mars under the belly of the rover. Somewhere between 60 to 90 Martian days (or sols) after the Mars 2020 rover lands, the helicopter will be deployed from the underside of the rover. Mars Helicopter Delivery System on the rover will rotate the helicopter down from the rover and release it onto the ground.

Why was the Mars rover Opportunity not working?
-----------------------------------------------

A layer of dust likely coated its solar panels, preventing it from juicing itself up after a 2018 sky-blackening dust storm on the Red Planet. But why couldn’t NASA launch a rescue mission to get it working again? After all, Opportunity wasn’t the first rover to get to Mars, and it won’t be the last. It’s just been the hardiest.

How can you tell the direction of a Mars rover?
-----------------------------------------------

To determine the rover pointing direction, the Pancam sweeps the sky until it finds the sun. Then, by patiently staring at the sun for 10 minutes or so, the sun tracks approximately 2.5 degrees across the sky. The flight team can then compute which way the rover is facing by using the sun’s movement and correlating it to the known time and date.
