Many devices, especially computers, batteries and tube TVs, contain harmful materials such as heavy metals. When these unwanted electronics end up in landfills, they begin to leak out these toxic chemicals, endangering landfill workers, the landfill itself and often the surrounding community.

What happens to old TVs and computers after dump?
-------------------------------------------------

Many people will receive a new computer or cell phone this holiday season — and throw out their old equipment. And when old TVs and computers end up in landfills, the toxic metals and flame retardants they contain can cause environmental problems.
