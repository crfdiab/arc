Where is biomass energy most commonly used?
-------------------------------------------

Most of the biomass is used as the primary energy source by people for heating and cooking, ranging from 65% in Haiti, 72% in Kenya, 78% in Democratic Republic of Congo, 81.5% in Nigeria, 85% in Tanzania, to 89% in Kenya and Niger.

Where is biomass being used today?
----------------------------------

Industry is the biggest biomass consumer today; it uses 51.5 percent of biomass to make products. The transportation sector uses 26.2 percent of biomass by consuming ethanol and other biofuels. Power companies use biomass to produce electricity. Over 10 percent of biomass is used to generate electricity today.

How is biomass energy used in everyday life?
--------------------------------------------

When biomass is burned, this stored energy is released as heat. Many different kinds of biomass, such as wood chips, corn, and some types of garbage, are used to produce electricity. Some types of biomass can be converted into liquid fuels called biofuels that can power cars, trucks, and tractors.

Is biomass cheaper than gas?
----------------------------

Biomass fuel is significantly cheaper per kW than oil and electricity and slightly cheaper than gas. And, if you have a supply of free wood, your fuel costs could disappear completely.

How is biomass energy used in the real world?
---------------------------------------------

There are various uses of biomass energy, such as using the power to produce heat for winters or heating buildings in cold climates. The energy produced by biomass can also be used to generate electricity through turbines and generators. Biofuels themselves can also be created using biomass energy. How can biomass energy use improve water quality?

Which is the best way to extract energy from biomass?
-----------------------------------------------------

One of the best ways to extract energy from once-living plant matter is to burn it. In short, biomass means using organic matter for energy. This can include wood and other plant matter, but it can also include other surprising energy sources, like animal dung.

What are the main feedstocks for biomass energy?
------------------------------------------------

The main biomass feedstocks for power are paper mill residue, lumber mill scrap, and municipal waste. For biomass fuels, the most common feedstocks used today are corn grain (for ethanol) and soybeans (for biodiesel).

Where is the largest biomass power plant in the world?
------------------------------------------------------

Asia and Australia are constructing and operating the most plants, although one of the largest gasification plants in the world is currently under construction in Stockton-on-Tees, England. This plant will eventually be able to convert more than 350,000 tons of MSW into enough energy to power 50,000 homes.
