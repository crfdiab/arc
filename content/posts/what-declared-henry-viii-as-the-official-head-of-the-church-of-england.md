What declared Henry VIII as the official head of the Church of England?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Acts of Supremacy  
The Acts of Supremacy are two acts passed by the Parliament of England in the 16th century that established the English monarchs as the head of the Church of England. The 1534 Act declared King Henry VIII and his successors as the Supreme Head of the Church, replacing the pope.

Why did Henry VIII establish himself as the head of the Church of England?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

On 15 January 1535 King Henry VIII was proclaimed Supreme Head of the Church of England as a result of his controversial Act of Supremacy. Foremost was Henry’s desire to abandon Rome, and to reject Catholic church’s opposition to his proposed divorce from Catherine of Aragon.

Who was the King of England and head of the church?
---------------------------------------------------

Henry VIII: King of England &amp; Head of Church. In 1534 the Act of Supremacy declared Henry himself to be Supreme Head of the Church of England, and anyone who denied this title was guilty of an act of treason. Some changes were also made in the church services, the Bible was translated into English, and printed copies were placed in the churches.

Why did King Henry want to be head of the church?
-------------------------------------------------

This was not enough to satisfy King Henry. He aspired to be called “sole protector and supreme head of the English church and clergy”. In addition, Henry wanted acknowledgement that the responsibility for delivering the souls of the English people to God lay with him, not with the bishops or the pope. This was completely revolutionary.

Who was the head of the church in 1547?
---------------------------------------

The Church that Henry VIII left Edward VI on his death in 1547 was very different to the Church he had inherited from Henry VII in 1509. In 1509, Henry’s Church was subservient to the Pope. By his death, the Pope had little, if any, authority over a Church that had in 1534 seen Henry place himself at the head of it as temporal head.

What did King Henry do with the power of Supremacy?
---------------------------------------------------

The Act of Supremacy made Henry head of the church with the power to “visit, redress, reform, correct or amend all errors, heresies and enormities;” to define faith; and to appoint bishops. This law also directed the monies which had previously been paid to Rome to the king’s coffers.
