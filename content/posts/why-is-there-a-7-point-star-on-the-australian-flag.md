Why is there a 7 point star on the Australian flag?
---------------------------------------------------

Below the Union Jack is a white Commonwealth, or Federation, star. It has seven points representing the unity of the six states and the territories of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is a constellation of five stars that can only be seen from the southern hemisphere and is a reminder of Australia’s geography.

What is the fifth star on the Australian flag?
----------------------------------------------

The Commonwealth Star is found on both the flag of Australia and the Coat of Arms of Australia. On the Australian flag the Star appears in the lower hoist quarter, beneath the representation of the Union flag, and as four of the five stars making up the Southern Cross on the fly.

How did the Federation Star get its name?
-----------------------------------------

Official name. Although the term “Federation Star” is frequently used, the term “Commonwealth Star” is the official name. This is because that was the name ascribed to the star by the Australian Government when the Australian flag was adopted and such adoption gazetted in the official Government gazette.

What does the emblem of the Federation look like?
-------------------------------------------------

The inside of the emblem is what it will still (or again) look like in the 24th century: three big stars and several small dots (amassed to form a galactic plane) on blue ground, here with a light blue seam. The leaves are white with a blue border.

When did the Commonwealth Star come into force?
-----------------------------------------------

Jump to navigation Jump to search. Commonwealth Star as the crest of Coat of Arms of Australia. The Commonwealth Star (also known as the Federation Star, the Seven Point Star, or the Star of Federation) is a seven-pointed star symbolising the Federation of Australia which came into force on 1 January 1901.

When was the star added to the Australian flag?
-----------------------------------------------

The original star had only six points; however, the proclamation in 1905 of the Territory of Papua led to the addition of the seventh point in 1909 to represent it and future territories. The Commonwealth Star is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Australian flag, as opposed to the similar flag of New Zealand .
