What are low degree latitudes called the zones?
-----------------------------------------------

4\. 23 ½’ N is called the TROPIC of CANCER\_. 5. Low degree latitudes are called the \_TROPIC\_ zones. 6.

What are low latitude climates?
-------------------------------

Overview of the Low-Latitude Climates: The low latitude climates lie for the most part between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. They occupy the equatorial zone, most of the tropical zone, and part of the subtropical zone. Climates in this region vary between extremely moist to extremely dry.

What areas are the low latitudes?
---------------------------------

The Southern Hemisphere low latitudes are considered to be the areas of the earth south of the equator and north of about 30 degrees latitude.

What is the lowest number of degrees in latitude?
-------------------------------------------------

Lines of latitude start at 0 degrees at the equator and end at 90 degrees at the North and South Poles (for a total to 180 degrees of latitude). Therefore, the higher the value of degree of latitude, the closer it is to the North or South Pole.

What seasons do low latitudes have?
-----------------------------------

The wet-dry tropical climate has a very dry season at low Sun and a very wet season at high Sun. During the low-Sun season, when the equatorial trough is far away, dry continental tropical (cT) air masses prevail.

How many degrees are in a high latitude zone?
---------------------------------------------

High latitude zones There are 90 degrees of latitude. Each zone of latitude is 30 degrees wide. The Equator is 0 degrees. 0 to 30 are low numbers, 30-60 are middle numbers, and 60 to 90 are high numbers.

Where does the low latitude climate zone occur?
-----------------------------------------------

A low-latitude climate zone is one of the three main climate groups, which occur in areas near the equator and are controlled by tropical air masses.

Where are low, mid and high latitudes located?
----------------------------------------------

High latitude is 60 degrees and above N (including the North Pole) and 60 degrees and above S (including the South Pole), mid latitude is 31 to 59 degrees N and 31 to 59 degrees S, and low latitude is 0 to 30 degrees N and 0 to 30 degrees S.

Which is the zero degree latitude of the Earth?
-----------------------------------------------

The equator forms the zero-degree latitude of Earth, while both the South Pole and the North Pole form the 90-degree latitudes. There are 90 degrees between the equator and each pole.
