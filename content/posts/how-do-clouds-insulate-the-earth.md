How do clouds insulate the Earth?
---------------------------------

Cloudy Climate Some kinds of clouds insulate Earth and keep it warm, while other kinds shade the planet and keep it cool. High, thin cirrus clouds tend to trap heat emitted by Earth, warming the planet. Low, thick cumulus clouds tend to shade and cool Earth by reflecting sunlight back into space.

How does rain cool the Earth?
-----------------------------

Rain Cools Us: When the droplet reaches us it cools its surroundings. Increased Humidity Can Make The Air Feel Colder: As the rain water warms it begins to evaporate, increasing the humidity of the air which correspondingly loses its ability to insulate – the air its self begins to feel cooler.

How can clouds influence the albedo of the Earth?
-------------------------------------------------

Clouds regulate the amount of solar radiation absorbed by a planet and its solar surface irradiance. Generally, increased cloud cover correlates to a higher albedo and a lower absorption of solar energy. Thin clouds (such as cirrus) tend to transmit more solar radiation and, therefore, have a low albedo.

Why is rain always cold?
------------------------

The rain water is cold because rain normally forms as ice and snow crystals in the upper atmosphere. It melts as it falls to earth, but can still be cooler than the air it falls into. The high heat capacity of this cool rain can have a noticeable chilling effect on the air at ground level.

Why are clouds so important?
----------------------------

Clouds are essential to the earth-atmosphere system. Clouds help regulate Earth’s energy balance by reflecting and scattering solar radiation and by absorbing Earth’s infrared energy. Clouds are required for precipitation to occur and, hence are an essential part of the hydrologic cycle.

Are clouds hot?
---------------

So clouds can have both a cooling effect and a warming effect. When it comes to Earth’s climate, do clouds warm more than they cool, or is it the other way around? Well, that depends on where the clouds are in Earth’s atmosphere. Clouds within a mile or so of Earth’s surface tend to cool more than they warm.

Why do clouds cool more than they warm?
---------------------------------------

Well, that depends on where the clouds are in Earth’s atmosphere. Clouds within a mile or so of Earth’s surface tend to cool more than they warm. These low, thicker clouds mostly reflect the Sun’s heat. This cools Earth’s surface.

How do clouds trap heat from the Sun?
-------------------------------------

Clouds can trap that heat from the Sun. At night, when there’s no sunlight, clouds are still trapping heat. It’s sort of like clouds are wrapping Earth in a big, warm blanket.

Why are there so many clouds on Earth?
--------------------------------------

Clouds give us a cooler climate on Earth than we would enjoy without clouds. However, as Earth’s climate warms, we won’t always be able to count on this cooling effect. At any given moment, about two-thirds of our planet is covered by clouds.

How are clouds related to radiation in space?
---------------------------------------------

Thus, they radiate at nearly the same intensity as the surface and do not greatly affect the infrared radiation emitted to space (their cloud greenhouse forcing on a planetary scale is small).
