What kind of rock is the Arc de Triomphe made of?
-------------------------------------------------

The Arc de Triomphe is made of limestone. The entirety of the Arc de Triomphe is made from a sedimentary rock called limestone.

Once bones and shells accumulate on the ocean floor, the combination of calcium carbonate and mud builds up and hardens into limestone.
