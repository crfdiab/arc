How do you describe altostratus clouds?
---------------------------------------

Altostratus clouds are “strato” type clouds (see below) that possess a flat and uniform type texture in the mid levels. They frequently indicate the approach of a warm front and may thicken and lower into stratus, then nimbostratus resulting in rain or snow.

What is the best description of altostratus clouds?
---------------------------------------------------

Altostratus are large mid-level sheets of thin cloud. Usually composed of a mixture of water droplets and ice crystals, they are thin enough in parts to allow you to see the Sun weakly through the cloud. They are often spread over a very large area and are typically featureless.

What is the shape of altostratus cloud?
---------------------------------------

Altostratus most often takes the form of a featureless sheet of cloud but can be wavy (undulatus) as a result of wind shear through the cloud. It can also be fragmented (fibratus) with clear sky visible, which often precedes the approach of a weakened or upper level warm front.

What do altocumulus clouds look like?
-------------------------------------

Altocumulus clouds are small mid-level layers or patches of clouds, called cloudlets, which most commonly exist in the shape of rounded clumps. Altocumulus are made up of a mix of ice and water, giving them a slightly more ethereal appearance than the big and fluffy lower level cumulus.

What level is the altostratus cloud?
------------------------------------

Altostratus clouds are mid-level, gray or blue-gray clouds that usually cover the whole sky. The Sun or moon may shine through an altostratus cloud, but will appear watery or fuzzy. If you see altostratus clouds, a storm with continuous rain or snow might be on its way.

What does an altostratus cloud look like in the sky?
----------------------------------------------------

This type is classified as an accessory cloud. These clouds look like semi-transparent veil. The sun or moon can be seen through these layers of clouds. It also results in the formation of corona, which is nothing but the scattering of light, through tiny particles of the cloud.

Which is darker altostratus or high cirrostratus?
-------------------------------------------------

If classification is changed to Nimbostratus rain can become persistent. Altostratus is a middle altitude cloud genus belonging to the stratiform physical category characterized by a generally uniform gray to bluish-green sheet or layer. It is lighter in color than nimbostratus and darker than high cirrostratus.

What kind of clouds look like ice crystals?
-------------------------------------------

Altocumulus clouds are made of water droplets and appear as gray, puffy masses, sometimes rolled out in parallel waves or bands. These clouds on a warm, humid summer morning often mean thunderstorms by late afternoon. Altostratus clouds, gray or blue-gray, are made up of ice crystals and water droplets.

How can you tell the difference between altocumulus and stratocumulus?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Telling Altocumulus and Stratocumulus Apart Altocumulus and stratocumulus are often mistaken. Besides altocumulus being higher up in the sky, another way to tell them apart is by the size of their individual cloud mounds. Place your hand up to the sky and in the direction of the cloud; if the mound is the size of your thumb, it’s altocumulus.
