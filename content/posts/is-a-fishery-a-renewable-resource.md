Is a fishery a renewable resource?
----------------------------------

For example, fish are renewable resources. That’s because they can reproduce and make more fish. But water pollution and overfishing can cause them to die out if their population becomes too low.

What type of resource is fisheries?
-----------------------------------

Fishery resources are comprised of myriad biological (e.g., plankton, fish, and mammal species), chemical (e.g., salinity, oxygen concentration), and physical (e.g., sediment type, oil and gas reserve, currents, space) attributes which can be further differentiated by quantity, quality, and relational attributes.

Is commercial fishing renewable or nonrenewable?
------------------------------------------------

Fish and shellfish are renewable resources—they can reproduce and replenish their populations naturally. Because of this, we can harvest fish within certain limits without depleting the whole population.

Is salmon a renewable resource?
-------------------------------

Wild salmon are a supremely renewable resource. We need to restore their habitat and encourage them to return forever – for our own sake as well as theirs.

Why are fish considered to be a renewable resource?
---------------------------------------------------

Fish populations that are managed carefully are considered a renewable resource. This is because fish can reproduce. So, even if some are caught, there will be new baby fish to grow up and replace them. However, many fish populations are getting smaller…

What are the resources of Fisheries and aquaculture?
----------------------------------------------------

Fisheries and aquaculture resources. Capture fisheries and aquaculture depend on the use of natural renewable resources and other resources (e.g. aquatic species, land and water) as raw material. Other resources such as hatchery-produced seeds, feeds and fertilizers are artificially generated.

Which is an example of a renewable resource?
--------------------------------------------

Demersal fish – groundfish – lobster, oysters, flounder, cod Pelagic fish – migrate over a wide area of the ocean A renewable resource Reproductive potential of fish depends on size of fish population and characteristics of habitat – assume habitat characteristics held constant for the moment

How is the management of Fisheries a complex process?
-----------------------------------------------------

Fisheries management is a complex process that requires the integration of resource biology and ecology, with socio-economic and institutional factors affecting the behavior of fishers and policy makers.
