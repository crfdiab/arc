When did South Africa ban DDT?
------------------------------

1974  
DDT was banned for general use in South Africa in 1974, but limited use of DDT to combat malaria continued in the northeastern part of South Africa until 1995, and resumed in 2000 (Wells and Leonard, 2006) following an increase in the incidence of malaria in the northwestern parts of the country (Fig. 1).

When did mosquitoes become resistant to DDT?
--------------------------------------------

DDT-resistant mosquitoes were first detected in India in 1959, and they have increased so rapidly that when a local spray program is begun now, most mosquitoes become resistant in a matter of months rather than years.

When did we start using the insecticide DDT?
--------------------------------------------

1940s  
DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) was developed as the first of the modern synthetic insecticides in the 1940s. It was initially used with great effect to combat malaria, typhus, and the other insect-borne human diseases among both military and civilian populations.

When was DDT last used?
-----------------------

December 31, 1972  
On June 14, 1972, the EPA Administrator announced the final cancellation of all remaining crop uses of DDT in the U.S. effective December 31, 1972. The order did not affect public health and quarantine uses, or exports of DDT.

Which countries still use DDT?
------------------------------

DDT can only be used in the US for public health emergencies, such as controlling vector disease. Today, DDT is manufactured in North Korea, India, and China. India remains the largest consumer of the product for vector control and agricultural use.

When did they stop using DDT in Africa?
---------------------------------------

Malaria is the second-leading cause of death in Africa after AIDS. After South Africa stopped using DDT against the disease in 1996 malaria cases climbed steadily — from 11,000 in 1997 to 42,000 just three years later.

Why was DDT used to kill mosquitoes?
------------------------------------

The mosquito takes up the insecticide while resting on walls and its toxicity kills her. In August 1943, the Army began spraying the interior of buildings and found the procedure effective. DDT lasted for over six months and as a result a malaria control team could cover many more houses and protect far more people.

How did they get rid of malaria before DDT?
-------------------------------------------

The principal methods of eradicating mosquitoes that carry malaria have been drainage ― especially when followed by cultivation ― and insecticides. Insecticides, notably pyrethrum, had been used in malaria control prior to DDT. This was sprayed on the inside walls of houses where the Anopheles mosquito rests after feeding.

When did they start spraying DDT in Italy?
------------------------------------------

In the spring of 1944, they began spraying in the town of Castel Volturno, north of Naples and later in the Tiber River Delta area.10 These highly successful efforts proved the practical usefulness of DDT in malaria control.
