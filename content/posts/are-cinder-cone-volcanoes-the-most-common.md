Are cinder cone volcanoes the most common?
------------------------------------------

Cinder cone volcanoes (also called scoria cones) are the most common type of volcano, according to San Diego State University, and are the symmetrical cone-shaped volcanoes we typically think of.

Why are most volcanoes on Earth cone shaped?
--------------------------------------------

They form when different types of eruptions deposit different materials around the sides of a volcano. Alternating eruptions of volcanic ash and lava cause layers to form. Over time these layers build up. The result is a cone that has a gentler slope than a cinder cone but is steeper than a shield volcano.

Are cinder cone volcanoes the most dangerous?
---------------------------------------------

Cinder cones are known for their very violent, explosive, exciting eruptions. Paricutin in Mexico and Mt. Vesuvius in Italy are famous cinder cones. Vulcanian eruptions are more violent and explosive than strombolian eruptions.

What kind of volcano has a cinder cone?
---------------------------------------

As a result, cinder cone volcanoes tend to be smaller than other types of volcanoes. Italy’s Mt. Vesuvius is a famous cinder cone volcano.

Where are cinder cones most likely to be found?
-----------------------------------------------

Often, cinder cones appear near larger volcanoes, but they also may be found away from all other volcanoes, as was the case with Paricutín. The exact composition of a cinder cone depends on the composition of the lava ejected from the Earth.

How tall is the Paricutin cinder cone volcano?

Today it is a volcano that is 1,391 feet in height and surrounded by about 90 square miles of lava flows. Photo by Brian Overcast / Alamy Stock Photo.
