What would happen if an ecosystem ran out of producers?
-------------------------------------------------------

The removal of the producers would cause the collapse of the entire food web. Primary consumers or herbivores, which feed on producers directly, would die off. Higher level consumers would suffer as organisms from lower trophic levels start to die off.

What would happen if the biosphere has no decomposers?
------------------------------------------------------

If there where no decomposers, the dead reamins and nutrients will pile up. Nutrient enrichment of soil will not take place. There will be no recycling of nutrients between the biotic and abiotic component of the ecosystem.

How is biosphere important for the sustenance of human life?
------------------------------------------------------------

Biosphere is important for sustenance of human life since it is a zone of contact of atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere. On lithosphere or land human beings live and construct houses for shelter, grow crops for food and fibre, extract minerals and forests are also grown on the land.

Could there be life on earth without producers?
-----------------------------------------------

(die) Without the sunlight most animals would expire. There could not be life on earth without producers. With no producers the animals would not be able to get the energy. Only producers can get energy from the sun, consumers eat the producers that create the energy from the sun.

What happens to an ecosystem if there are no producers?
-------------------------------------------------------

EX. if there was no sun, then there would be no grass. What would happen to an ecosystem if all its producer were eliminated? If producers were eliminated, the consumers would die and the whole ecosystem will decrease. What would happen if the primary producer was removed from the food web?

What would happen if we didn’t have a biosphere?
------------------------------------------------

nothing would happen. Life on Earth occurred and evolved in form of Biosphere – network of interrelated consumers that were consuming and dispersed incoming sun energy for transforming it together with the required resources into further exergy producing and complexity level increase, preventing by this the overheating of the surface.

How are dead plants and animals part of the biosphere?
------------------------------------------------------

The remains of dead plants and animals release nutrient s into the soil and ocean. These nutrients are re- absorb ed by growing plants. This exchange of food and energy makes the biosphere a self-supporting and self-regulating system.

What happens to the biosphere when people burn fossil fuels?
------------------------------------------------------------

For example, in the atmosphere, oxygen levels decrease and carbon dioxide levels increase when people clear forest s or burn fossil fuel s such as coal and oil. Oil spill s and industrial wastes threaten life in the hydrosphere. The future of the biosphere will depend on how people interact with other living things within the zone of life.
