What is the problem with lay investiture?
-----------------------------------------

It began as a dispute in the 11th century between the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII. The question was who would control appointments of bishops (investiture). The controversy led to many years of bitterness and nearly fifty years of civil war in Germany.

What were the causes of the investiture conflict?
-------------------------------------------------

The crisis began when a group within the church, members of the Gregorian Reform, decided to rebel against the rule of simony by forcefully taking the power of investiture from the ruling secular power, i.e., the Holy Roman Emperor, and placing that power wholly within control of the church.

What did the Pope do to Henry IV?
---------------------------------

In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from their allegiance. German aristocrats who were hostile to Henry called for the Pope to hold an assembly in Germany to hear Henry’s case.

Who was the pope at the time of the Investiture Controversy?
------------------------------------------------------------

It began as a power struggle between Pope Gregory VII and Henry IV (then King, later Holy Roman Emperor) in 1076. The conflict ended in 1122, when Pope Callixtus II and Emperor Henry V agreed on the Concordat of Worms.

What did the investiture of Henry IV declare?
---------------------------------------------

One clause asserted that the deposal of an emperor was under the sole power of the pope. It declared that the Roman church was founded by God alone—that the papal power was the sole universal power. By this time, Henry IV was no longer a child, and he continued to appoint his own bishops.

How did the Investiture Controversy affect the Roman Empire?
------------------------------------------------------------

In the long term, the decline of imperial power would divide Germany until the 19th century. Similarly, in Italy, the Investiture Controversy weakened the emperor’s authority and strengthened local separatist forces. However, the papacy grew stronger from the controversy.

When did Pope Gregory VII ban the investiture of ecclesiastics?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Gregory VII eventually banned completely the investiture of ecclesiastics by all laymen, including kings. The prohibition was first promulgated in September 1077 in France by the papal legate Hugh of Die at the Council of Autun.
