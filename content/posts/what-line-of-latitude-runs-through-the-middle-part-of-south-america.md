What line of latitude runs through the middle part of South America?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tropic of Capricorn is the dividing line between the Southern Temperate Zone to the south and the tropics to the north.

Between which line of longitude does most of South America lie?
---------------------------------------------------------------

South America’s latitude and longitude lies between 14.6048° S, 59.0625° W. It is the world’s fourth largest continent on Earth, and the fifth most populous.

What are the major lines of latitude that pass through South America?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything south of latitude 66.5622 degrees south at all lines of longitude. What is the line of latitude that runs across South America and Africa? The continents of South America and Africa share the range of latitude from roughly 34.83&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg; South to 12.63&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg; North.

Where does the equator run through South America?
-------------------------------------------------

The Equator at zero degrees latitude bisects the earth into the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere and runs around the middle of the earth. The Equator runs through South America and passes about 15 miles from the center of Quito, Ecuador. What is the vertical lines that run through the north and south poles?

Where do the lines of longitude meet on a map?
----------------------------------------------

Lines Of Longitude, With Maps. Lines of longitude are imaginary vertical lines that run north and south around the Earth and meeting at the North and South Pole. These longitude lines break up the Earth in equal “slices” in order to determine where a point is located on Earth horizontally. You’ve probably heard of latitude and longitude before.

What is the distance between longitudes at the equator?
-------------------------------------------------------

The distance between longitudes at the equator is the same as latitude, roughly 69 miles. At 45 degrees north or south, the distance between is about 49 miles (79 km). The distance between longitudes reaches zero at the poles as the lines of meridian converge at that point.
