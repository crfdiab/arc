What is a shell in an atom?
---------------------------

An electron shell is the outside part of an atom around the atomic nucleus. It is a group of atomic orbitals with the same value of the principal quantum number n. Electron shells have one or more electron subshells, or sublevels.

What are orbits or shells of an atom?
-------------------------------------

The electrons in an atom are arranged in shells that surround the nucleus, with each successive shell being farther from the nucleus. Electron shells consist of one or more subshells, and subshells consist of one or more atomic orbitals.

What is the difference between an orbital and a shell?
------------------------------------------------------

The main difference between shell subshell and orbital is that shells are composed of electrons that share the same principal quantum number and subshells are composed of electrons that share the same angular momentum quantum number whereas orbitals are composed of electrons that are in the same energy level but have …

Why are the shells named KLMN?
------------------------------

The names of the electron shell were given by a spectroscopist named Charles G Barkla. He named the innermost shell has k shell because he noticed that the X-rays emitted two types energies. He noticed that K type X-rays emitted the highest energy. Therefore, he named the innermost shell as the K shell.

Why are there 18 electrons in the third shell?
----------------------------------------------

A s orbital, a set of (3)p orbitals and a set of (5)d orbitals form the 3rd subshell. Each orbital carries 2 electrons and you can actually find that 18 electrons can be shot in. This is because it is the 3rd shell’s full power and it does not say the order in which the electrons are filled.

How many orbitals are in a shell?
---------------------------------

The number of orbitals in a shell is the square of the principal quantum number: 12 = 1, 22 = 4, 32 = 9. There is one orbital in an s subshell (l = 0), three orbitals in a p subshell (l = 1), and five orbitals in a d subshell (l = 2).

Which subshell is common to all shells?
---------------------------------------

s− Subshell  
s− Subshell is common to all shells.

Why is KLMN not ABCD?
---------------------

He later renamed these two types K and L since he realized that the highest energy X-rays produced in his experiments might not be the highest energy X-ray possible. He wanted to make certain that there was room to add more discoveries without ending up with an alphabetical list of X-rays whose energies were mixed up.

What does KLMN stand for?
-------------------------

KLMN is the notation that is used for indicating the number of electrons of an atom with each principal quantum number.

Is the ring of a molecule flat or tipped up?
--------------------------------------------

At each angle change is a carbon atom, and each carbon has the correct number of hydrogens, two each, to fulfill the 4 bond rule of carbon. However, the ring is not flat as implied by the line drawings. As shown in the ball and stick structure, the left most carbon is tipped up from the ring.

Which is the simplest of the ring compounds?
--------------------------------------------

The simplest ring compound contains 3 carbons as in cyclopropane. The most common ring compounds contain either 5 or 6 carbons. These compounds are also called cyclic. Cyclopentane: Although the simplest representation is that of a line drawing of a pentagon as shown on the left.

Which is the correct representation of a ring molecule?
-------------------------------------------------------

Although the simplest representation is that of a line drawing of a pentagon as shown on the left. At each angle change is a carbon atom, and each carbon has the correct number of hydrogens, two each, to fulfill the 4 bond rule of carbon.

Which is the most complex atom in the universe?
-----------------------------------------------

The next most-complex atom is helium, which has two protons in its nucleus and two orbiting electrons. These electrons fill the two available states in the lowest shell, producing what is called a filled shell. The next atom is lithium, with three electrons.
