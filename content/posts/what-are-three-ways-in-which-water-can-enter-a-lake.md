What are three ways in which water can enter a lake?
----------------------------------------------------

The water in lakes comes from rain, snow, melting ice, streams, and groundwater seepage.

Where does the water in lakes go?
---------------------------------

Creeks flow into streams, which flow through lakes, which ultimately end up in major rivers that drain into the ocean. You can picture it like branches of a tree going down into the trunk. These watershed areas are defined by topography, or ridges of elevation.

How does water stay in a lake?
------------------------------

For a lake to keep its water over time, it has to be replenished. The main way that water gets into reservoirs and man-made lakes is from the rivers and streams that were dammed to create them. Like man-made reservoirs and lakes, natural lakes may also be replenished by rivers and streams.

What is the source of water in a lake?
--------------------------------------

Lakes are supplied with water by rainfall that falls directly on the surface of the lake, by water run-off from the adjacent land and small streams, or by groundwater that seeps through the soil to the lowest point which is the lake.

How do they fill up man made lakes?
-----------------------------------

Man made lakes are usually constructed by building a dam across A deep river valley which then backs up with water flooding several square miles of land . This is to allow the storage of drinking water and quite often as a source of hydro electric power by runnnig the water through turbines .

Do lakes dry up?
----------------

A number of lakes throughout the world are drying or completely dry due to irrigation or urban use diverting inflow.

Does water flow out of a lake?
------------------------------

How does water get out of a lake? It may evaporate from the surface of the lake. That’s when the Sun’s energy turns some water into a gas called water vapor. Or, water may leave a lake in a river that drains extra water away.

Where does the water come from to form a lake?
----------------------------------------------

A lake is where surface-water runoff (and maybe some groundwater seepage) have accumulated in a low spot, relative to the surrounding countryside. It’s not that the water that forms lakes get trapped, but that the water entering a lake comes in faster than it can escape, either via outflow in a river, seepage into the ground, or by evaporation.

What happens when water evaporates from a lake?
-----------------------------------------------

It may evaporate from the surface of the lake. That’s when the Sun’s energy turns some water into a gas called water vapor. Or, water may leave a lake in a river that drains extra water away.

When does a river turn into a lake?
-----------------------------------

A river has its natural and defined banks (well, most rivers do at least so lets focus on them first). A lake, at some point, at the head of the lake (where the river feeds it) the river obviously floods over its God-given natural banks. Would this have happened if there were no lake (dam) downstream?

How are lakes and reservoirs affected by humans?
------------------------------------------------

It’s not that the water that forms lakes get trapped, but that the water entering a lake comes in faster than it can escape, either via outflow in a river, seepage into the ground, or by evaporation. And if humans live nearby, then water levels can be affected by water withdrawals for human needs.
