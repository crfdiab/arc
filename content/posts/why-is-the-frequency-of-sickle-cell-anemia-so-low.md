Why is the frequency of sickle cell anemia so low?
--------------------------------------------------

If only one sickle cell allele were to cause the disease, individuals heterozygous for the sickle cell allele would have no selective advantage over individuals homozygous for the sickle cell allele. As a result, the frequency of the sickle cell allele would be lower.

Why is the frequency of sickle cell anemia higher in some populations around the world?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sickle cell disease occurs more often among people from parts of the world where malaria is or was common. It is believed that people who carry the sickle cell trait are less likely to have severe forms of malaria.

Why is sickle cell anemia common in sub-Saharan Africa?
-------------------------------------------------------

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is common throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, affecting up to 3% of births in some parts of the continent. Nevertheless, it remains a low priority for many health ministries. The most common form of SCD is caused by homozygosity for the β-globin S gene mutation (SS disease).

Why is sickle cell anemia high in Africa?
-----------------------------------------

People with one sickle cell gene carry SCT, which typically does not cause severe disease. However, African Americans are at a much higher risk of experiencing SCD. Researchers believe this could be because SCD evolved in human populations living where malaria is common, to help protect against the disease.

What was Dr Allison’s initial observations?
-------------------------------------------

What were Dr. Allison’s initial questions when he went to East Africa in 1949? distribution of the ABO blood groups and other inherited characteristics, including the sickle cell allele, in East African tribes.

Why is sickle cell immune to malaria?
-------------------------------------

While the genetic mutation in the beta globin gene producing sickle hemoglobin (HbS) causes severe vascular complications that can lead to early death in individuals who are homozygous (SS) for the mutation, in its heterozygous form (AS), it partially protects against severe malaria caused by P.

What is the average lifespan of someone with sickle cell disease?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Results: Among children and adults with sickle cell anemia (homozygous for sickle hemoglobin), the median age at death was 42 years for males and 48 years for females. Among those with sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease, the median age at death was 60 years for males and 68 years for females.

What is the link between sickle cell and malaria?
-------------------------------------------------

People develop sickle-cell disease, a condition in which the red blood cells are abnormally shaped, if they inherit two faulty copies of the gene for the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin. The faulty gene persists because even carrying one copy of it confers some resistance to malaria.

What are the 3 stages of malaria?
---------------------------------

When the parasite infects animals, it attacks in three stages: It goes into liver cells first, then enters blood cells, and finally forms gametes that can be transmitted to mosquitos. Most treatments primarily target parasites in the blood stage, which causes malaria’s symptoms—fever, vomiting, and coma.

How often does sickle cell disease occur in Africa?
---------------------------------------------------

He found about 20% of the population affected by the sickle-cell condition (disease + trait). However, a striking observation became apparent: while the frequency of sickle-cell trait in Africa was three times that in the United States, sickle cell disease was much less common.

What is the geographic distribution of sickle cell anemia?
----------------------------------------------------------

Biogeography and Ecology of Sickle Cell Anemia. The Unique Geographic Distribution Pattern of Sickle-Cell Anemia Almost as soon as sickle cell anemia was recognized as a blood-based disease, its higher frequency in families of African descent was noted. However, the first reports of cases in Africa itself did not come until the 1920s.

Why was sickle cell anemia lower in frequency?
----------------------------------------------

Thus, in accordance with the data, sickle-cell was lower in frequency in the U.S. because there was no advantage to the heterozygote or the homozygote recessive.

Why is sickle cell anemia common in areas with malaria?
-------------------------------------------------------

Thus, if a group of organisms with a particular trait has a decreased chance of surviving to reproduction, there is a decreased chance that the genes for this trait will be passed on to the next generation. This in turn may lead to the extinction of the trait.
