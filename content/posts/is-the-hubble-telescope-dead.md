Is the Hubble Telescope dead?
-----------------------------

The telescope was last serviced in 2009, following which it has taken more than 6,00,000 observations, bringing its lifetime total to more than 1.5 million. Nasa had earlier said that most of the observations missed while science operations were suspended will be rescheduled for a later date.

What happened in 1986 with the Hubble Space Telescope?
------------------------------------------------------

However, in 1986 disaster struck. The Challenger accident forced NASA to ground the Space Shuttle fleet for two years. Finally, on April 24, 1990, the Space Shuttle Discovery lifted off from earth with the Hubble Space Telescope nestled securely in its bay.

Can Hubble be fixed?
--------------------

To fix the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA might have to rely on a computer that hasn’t turned on since 2009. After three failed attempts to fix Hubble, NASA has narrowed it down to a computer-processing issue. Hubble might have to switch to backup computer hardware that hasn’t been powered up since 2009.

How did they fix Hubble?
------------------------

NASA finally fixed the Hubble Space Telescope after nearly five weeks without science operations. Hubble switched to backup hardware to correct the mysterious glitch that took it offline.

What was the impact of the Hubble Space Telescope?
--------------------------------------------------

Since launch, Hubble has overcome its troubled beginnings to perform innumerable science observations that have revolutionized humanity’s understanding of the universe. About – Hubble History Timeline | NASA

When did the Hubble Space Telescope go into safe mode?
------------------------------------------------------

NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has brought us images of distant galaxies, comets breaking up, black holes and more during its time in space. On October 5, NASA was made aware that the craft automatically went into safe mode around 6 p.m. EDT.

Why did the gyroscope fail on the Hubble telescope?
---------------------------------------------------

A week after the failure of the gyroscope, NASA was still working to resume operations on board the Hubble telescope. Part of the delay had to do with the fact that one of the backup gyroscopes, installed with redundancy in mind, also wasn’t functioning properly once it was turned on.

How often does Hubble look at the universe?
-------------------------------------------

Hubble explores the universe 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. That means it has observed some fascinating cosmic wonder every day of the year, including on your birthday. What did Hubble look at on your birthday?
