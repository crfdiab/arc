Can warmer water hold more dissolved oxygen?
--------------------------------------------

Dissolved oxygen, temperature, and aquatic life Cold water can hold more dissolved oxygen than warm water. In winter and early spring, when the water temperature is low, the dissolved oxygen concentration is high. In summer and fall, when the water temperature is high, the dissolved-oxygen concentration is often lower.

Do warmer waters have less oxygen?
----------------------------------

Ocean warming-driven deoxygenation: Warmer ocean water holds less oxygen and is more buoyant than cooler water. This leads to reduced mixing of oxygenated water near the surface with deeper waters, which naturally contain less oxygen. Warmer water also raises oxygen demand from living organisms.

Does warm or cold water hold more dissolved gases?
--------------------------------------------------

Some of the properties of seawater affect how much gas can be dissolved in it: Cold water holds more gas than warm water.

How does heat affect dissolved oxygen in water?
-----------------------------------------------

Air and Water Temperature Increases Lower levels of dissolved oxygen due to the inverse relationship that exists between dissolved oxygen and temperature. As the temperature of the water increases, dissolved oxygen levels decrease.

Why does oxygen dissolve more in cold water?
--------------------------------------------

In Summary: In cold water, the H20 molecules are closer together. As temperature of water decreases, the solubility of oxygen in water increases because of the intermolecular forces occurring between water and oxygen.

Why does cold water hold more dissolved oxygen than warm water?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Cold water can hold more dissolved oxygen than warm water. The maximum amount of dissolved oxygen that can be held is known as the saturation value. WHY? In cold water, the H20 molecules are closer together. (They are more tightly packed, they have a lower Kinetic energy, and therefore less space for movement between molecules.)

Why is there so little oxygen in water?
---------------------------------------

 Water doesn’t hold much oxygen, so lakes and the oceans are relatively low in oxygen, especially if the water is warm. Oxygen made in the water by growing plants tends to form bubbles that rise and escape to the air above. Aquariums often need “bubblers” to add air to the water and give the fish enough oxygen to breathe.

Why does fresh water have more dissolved oxygen than fresh water?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The amount of dissolved oxygen that a given volume of water can hold is a function of atmospheric pressure, water temperature, and the amount of other substances dissolved in the water. At sea level, fresh water can absorb more oxygen per volume than water at mountainous elevations because of the higher atmospheric pressure near sea level.

How are dissolved oxygen levels dependent on temperature?
---------------------------------------------------------

As this picture shows, modern meters are small and highly electronic. They still use a probe, which is located at the end of the cable. Dissolved oxygen is dependent on temperature (an inverse relation), so the meter must be calibrated properly before each use. Do you want to test your local water quality?
