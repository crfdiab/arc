What is the capacity of Lake Eyre?
----------------------------------

60,000 people  
The Lake Eyre Basin is one of the largest and most pristine desert river systems on the planet, supporting 60,000 people and a wealth of wildlife. It’s a rarity in a world that has harnessed, tapped, pumped and dammed its rivers, sometimes, to death.

Is there much water in Lake Eyre?
---------------------------------

The water has reached Belt Bay (the deepest point of the Lake) and is now spilling over and spreading out. There is still a vast amount of water still making its way down the river system towards the Lake as well. The water has now reached Lake Eyre.

Does Lake Eyre overflow?
------------------------

Water flowing into Madigan Gulf is spread over such a large area it evaporates rapidly. In 1984 a rare occurrence saw Lake Eyre South not only fill but overflow through the Goyder Channel to fill Madigan Gulf and Belt Bay to ~3 metres!

How often does Lake Eyre flood?
-------------------------------

every three years  
Typically a 1.5 m (5 ft) flood occurs every three years, a 4 m (13 ft) flood every decade, and a fill or near fill a few times a century. The water in the lake soon evaporates, with a minor or medium flood drying by the end of the following summer.

How much water is in Lake Eyre south?
-------------------------------------

Here’s what he had to say about it: How much water is in the lake? Water levels in Lake Eyre (North)/Kati Thanda peaked at about 65-70 per cent surface coverage in June but have been dropping, so it’s now at about 55 per cent coverage. Lake Eyre (South)/Kati Thanda remained dry during this flood event.

How long does it take for Lake Eyre to be full?
-----------------------------------------------

It is estimated that these waters reach Lake Eyre roughly 8 years in 100. When the lake is full, a notable phenomenon is that around midday the surface can often become very flat. The surface then reflects the sky in a way that leaves both the horizon and water surface virtually impossible to see.

Where is the lowest point in Lake Eyre?
---------------------------------------

Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre • Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre is located within the arid and semi-arid deserts of central Australia and contains the country’s lowest point (15.2 metres below sea level). • In most years, some water reaches the lake though the coverage is often quite low. When water does enter the lake most parts are only a few centimetres deep.

How big is the Lake Eyre Basin in Australia?
--------------------------------------------

The Lake Eyre basin (/ɛər/ AIR) is a drainage basin that covers just under one-sixth of all Australia.
