How long would it take electricity to travel around the world?
--------------------------------------------------------------

This makes the observable speed of electricity about the same as the speed of light: 186,000 miles per second, or 299,792 km/s. With this known a simple calculation gives the speed of electrical activity through a wire stretching around the entire Earth at well under one second, about 0.134 seconds.

How long does light take to travel from Earth to moon?
------------------------------------------------------

about 1.3 seconds  
Light travels at 300,000 kilometres per second, so it takes about 1.3 seconds for light to travel from the Moon back to the Earth. In other words, the Moon is 1.3 light-seconds away from the Earth.

What speed does electricity travel?
-----------------------------------

In the case of an electrical cord connecting a table lamp or some other household item to a power source, the copper wire inside the cord acts as the conductor. This energy travels as electromagnetic waves at about the speed of light, which is 670,616,629 miles per hour,1 or 300 million meters per second.

How many times can light travel around the Earth in a second?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The speed of light in a vacuum is 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second), and in theory nothing can travel faster than light. In miles per hour, light speed is, well, a lot: about 670,616,629 mph. If you could travel at the speed of light, you could go around the Earth 7.5 times in one second.

Which is faster electricity or light?
-------------------------------------

Light travels through empty space at 186,000 miles per second. The electricity which flows through the wires in your homes and appliances travels much slower: only about 1/100 th the speed of light.

Can electricity travel in a vacuum?
-----------------------------------

Even at low voltages, electricity can in fact travel through a perfect vacuum. At low voltages though electrons flow invisible. A vacuum arc can occur if the electric field is sufficient to cause field electron emission.

How long is a Lightyear in years?
---------------------------------

The light-year, alternatively spelled lightyear, is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances and is equivalent to about 9.46 trillion kilometres (9.46×1012 km) or 5.88 trillion miles (5.88×1012 mi)….

Which is faster sound or electricity?
-------------------------------------

No, electrical current travels at a percentage of the speed of light usually well more than 50% in wires, or faster than 150 million meters per second. Sound travels at a mere 343 meters per second in air.

Is light faster than electricity?

How long would it take to get From the Earth to the Moon?
---------------------------------------------------------

How long would it take to get from the Earth to the Moon? 1 Travelling at the speed of light, we could reach the moon within approximately 1.82s. 2 Travelling by car, it would take around 131 days 3 Travelling by a rocket (as did those on the Apollo missions) it would take 13.5 hours.

How does electricity travel at the speed of light?
--------------------------------------------------

How Fast Does Electricity Travel? Electricity travels at the speed of light, which is 186,000 miles per second. This is because electricity is electromagnetic radiation just like light. Electricity is the flow of electrons through a conducting wire such as copper and aluminum.

What was the quickest way to get to the Moon?
---------------------------------------------

Apollo missions took about three days to reach the moon. But the quickest trip to the moon was the New Horizons probe, which zipped past the moon in just 8 hours 35 minutes on its way to Pluto. However, the spacecraft didn’t even slow down or approach lunar orbit.

How many times can light travel around the Earth in 1 second?
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you were traveling at the speed of light you could fly around the world 7 and a half times in one second. Superman eat your heart out.
