What type of weathering is wind carrying sand?
----------------------------------------------

Gravity causes abrasion as a rock tumbles down a mountainside or cliff. Moving water causes abrasion as particles in the water collide and bump against one another. Strong winds carrying pieces of sand can sandblast surfaces.

What type of weathering causes sand?
------------------------------------

MECHANICAL WEATHERING Emphasize that the earth’s crust is constantly breaking down into smaller bits, with rock turning into sand, sand into silt, and silt into clay.

What type of weathering is wind and water abrasion?
---------------------------------------------------

Rocks break down into smaller pieces through weathering. Rocks and sediment grinding against each other wear away surfaces. This type of weathering is called abrasion, and it happens as wind and water rush over rocks. The rocks become smoother as rough and jagged edges break off.

What are materials that settle out of wind and water?
-----------------------------------------------------

Earth Science – Erosion &amp; Deposition

<table><tr><th>A</th><th>B</th></tr><tr><td>SEDIMENT</td><td>Small, solid particles of material from rocks or organisms which are moved by water or wind, resulting in erosion and deposition.</td></tr><tr><td>DEPOSITION</td><td>The process by which sediment settles out of the water or wind that is carrying it, and is deposited in a new location.</td></tr></table>

What’s the difference between a wind sea and a swell?
-----------------------------------------------------

When directly generated and affected by local winds, a wind wave system is called a wind sea. After the wind ceases to blow, wind waves are called swells. More generally, a swell consists of wind-generated waves that are not significantly affected by the local wind at that time. They have been generated elsewhere or some time ago.

Why are the paths of water in a wind wave circular?
---------------------------------------------------

The paths of water molecules in a wind wave are circular only when the wave is traveling in deep water. A wave cannot “feel” the bottom when it moves through water deeper than half its wavelength because too little wave energy is contained in the small circles below that depth.

What is the role of wind and water in coastal erosion?
------------------------------------------------------

Coastal Erosion. Coastal erosion involves the breaking down and removal of material along a coastline by the movement of wind &amp; water. It leads to the formation of many landforms and, combined with deposition, plays an important role in shaping the coastline.

What makes rock soft in the presence of water?
----------------------------------------------

Iron combines with oxygen in the presence of water in a process called oxidation. The product of oxidation is rust. Rock that contains iron also oxidizes or rusts. Rust makes rock soft and crumbly and gives a red or brown color.
