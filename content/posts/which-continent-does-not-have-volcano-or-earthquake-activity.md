Which continent does not have volcano or earthquake activity?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Even though Australia is home to nearly 150 volcanoes, none of them has erupted for about 4,000 to 5,000 years! The lack of volcanic activity is due to the island’s location in relation to a tectonic plate, the two layers of the Earth’s crust (or lithosphere).

Are there any islands that are still part of Europe?
----------------------------------------------------

The ocean flooded many low-lying areas, creating islands such as the British Isles, which were once part of mainland Europe. Some large continental islands are broken off the main continental shelf, but still associated with the continent. These are called microcontinent s or continental crustal fragments.
