How did the Inuit use their environment for shelter?
----------------------------------------------------

The Inuit learned to make warm homes out of snow and ice for the winter. During the summer they would make homes from animal skin stretched over a frame made from driftwood or whalebones. The Inuit word for home is “igloo”.

How is an igloo built?
----------------------

Igloos are built from compressed snow. You saw it into chunks like building blocks, then stack the blocks around a circular terraced hole in the snowy ground. Snow is endlessly interesting considering it’s simply semi-frozen water. An igloo floor is never just flat like the inside of a tent.

Do any Inuit still live in igloos?
----------------------------------

Many people believe incorrectly that Inuit live only in igloos. In fact, although most Inuit live in regular old houses now, igloos are still used for the occasional hunting trip.

What did the Inuit build in the winter?
---------------------------------------

If you are an Inuit hunter, you might build an igloo. An igloo is a shelter built from snow and ice. Not all the people of the Arctic built igloos. The Inuit people of Northern Canada built them. Igloos were never permanent houses for the Inuit. Instead, a large igloo might house one or more families in the cold winter months.

Why did the Inuit build the igloo shelters?
-------------------------------------------

Instead, a large igloo might house one or more families in the cold winter months. Tent-like houses sheltered those same families in the summer. Today the Inuit live mostly in wooden houses. But Inuit hunters, traveling far from their homes, still build igloo shelters. Igloos raise an interesting question. Why a house of ice?

Where did the Inuit tribe live in Canada?
-----------------------------------------

The Inuit are people of the Arctic Native American cultural group. The location of their tribal homelands are shown on the map in present-day Alaska, Canada and Greenland. The geography of the region in which they lived dictated the lifestyle and culture of the Inuit tribe.

How did the Inuit people get their food?
----------------------------------------

Usually the women did the rowing, while the men steered the boat. The Inuit lived nomadic lifestyles, so they did not stay in one place for an extended period of time. Since hunting and fishing was their main source of food, they were forced to move around, following the seasonal migration patterns of area animals.
