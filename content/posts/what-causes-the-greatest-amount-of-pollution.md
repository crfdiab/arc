How is plastic pollution bad for the ocean?

Most plastic ocean pollution is floating between the water and beaches. Over time the plastic will break down into smaller pieces, hastened as the sun degrades the plastic fragments. As you might expect, ocean pollution is not a good thing for our marine wildlife (or humans).
