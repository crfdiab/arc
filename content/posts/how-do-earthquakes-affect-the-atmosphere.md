How do earthquakes affect the atmosphere?
-----------------------------------------

Earthquakes effect the atmosphere because Gas emissions from ground release toxic gases that are released into the atmosphere. Earthquakes create dust, debris and gas emissions released from the ground. These toxic gases to the atmosphere which add to the air people breath from.

How does the environment change after an earthquake?
----------------------------------------------------

Earthquake environmental effects are the effects caused by an earthquake, including surface faulting, tsunamis, soil liquefactions, ground resonance, landslides and ground failure, either directly linked to the earthquake source or provoked by the ground shaking.

What can change the atmosphere?
-------------------------------

Human activities are also responsible for atmospheric change. For example, the burning of fossil fuels is producing a worldwide increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, which transmits visible light but traps infrared radiation near the Earth’s surface.

What effect does an earthquake have?
------------------------------------

The primary effects of earthquakes are ground shaking, ground rupture, landslides, tsunamis, and liquefaction. Fires are probably the single most important secondary effect of earthquakes.

How does tsunami affect the atmosphere?
---------------------------------------

Tsunamis also cause disturbance in the atmosphere. The waves generated by the earthquake and resulting tsunamis can cause ripples in the ionosphere, depending on their intensity. These ripples are caused by the acoustic and Rayleigh waves created by the earthquake and the gravity waves caused by the tsunami.

Will the atmosphere continue to change?
---------------------------------------

The simple answer is no. Once we release the carbon dioxide stored in the fossil fuels we burn, it accumulates in and moves among the atmosphere, the oceans, the land and the plants and animals of the biosphere. The released carbon dioxide will remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years.

How does an earthquake affect the Earth’s atmosphere?
-----------------------------------------------------

Atmosphere: the gaseous envelope surrounding the earth; the air we breathe. Earthquakes indirectly contribute the enhanced greenhouse effect. They are known to release methane from pockets within the ground to the atmosphere by the movement of tectonic plates.

What causes the Earth to shake when there is an earthquake?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Earthquakes are caused by either volcanic activity or shifting of massive tectonic plates underneath the surface of the earth. The plates have a ton of pressure and are pressing against each other, and when the plates suddenly shift it causes the entire ground to move, shake or break apart.

How does the pumping of groundwater affect earthquakes?
-------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, pumping of groundwater from underground aquifers by humans, which is exacerbated during times of drought, has also been shown to impact patterns of stress loads by “unweighting” Earth’s crust.

How are most earthquakes caused by tectonic forces?
---------------------------------------------------

With the advent of seismology — the study of earthquakes — we now know that most quakes are caused by tectonic processes — forces within the solid Earth that drive changes in the structure of Earth’s crust, primarily the rupture of underground rock masses along faults (linear zones of weakness).
