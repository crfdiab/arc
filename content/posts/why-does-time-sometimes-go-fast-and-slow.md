Why does time sometimes go fast and slow?
-----------------------------------------

“Through the feeling of our body over time we sense duration,” he said. When we’re not doing anything, we’re less distracted and are more sensitive to how we feel and to the passing of time. So, if we are focusing on something fun then we pay less attention to the passing of time, and it appears to move more quickly.

Why is time sometimes so slow?
------------------------------

The speed of time seems to be largely determined by how much information our minds absorb and process — the more information there is, the slower time goes. This connection was verified by the psychologist Robert Ornstein in the 1960s.

Can we speed up time?
---------------------

As we grow older, it can often feel like time goes by faster and faster. This speeding up of subjective time with age is well documented by psychologists, but there is no consensus on the cause. Like a slow-motion camera that captures thousands of images per second, time appears to pass more slowly.

Can we slow time?
-----------------

We can’t slow time itself down, but we can do things to pace ourselves and create more lasting impressions of times past. The expression “time flies,” originating from the Latin phrase “tempus fugit,” is one we all find ourselves saying or thinking, even when we aren’t having fun (as the extended expression goes).

At what speed does time slow down?
----------------------------------

Even at the “low speed” of 10% of the speed of light (300,000 km per second, or 186,300 miles per second) our clocks would slow down by only around 1%, but if we travel at 95% of the speed of light time will slow down to about one-third of that measured by a stationary observer.

Does time move slower the faster you travel?
--------------------------------------------

As light is spread out by the observer moving away from the source of the light time is decreased. Time slows down as you travel faster because momentum bends the fabric of spacetime causing time to pass slower.

Is there a drug that slows down time?
-------------------------------------

Drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamine and alcohol appear to make time speed up, whereas haloperidol and marijuana appear to slow time down. Drugs alter perceived time by affecting the speed of our internal clock and the amount of attention that we pay to time.

Why do some days feel fast and others slow?
-------------------------------------------

If you get into a flow state where you are working very efficiently and your mind is consumed by the task, time seems to pass very quickly. If you are in a state of anticipation, waiting for or dreading of something happening, time will seem to pass more slowly.

Is it better to go fast or go slow?
-----------------------------------

To get things back in working order, we need to carve out some time to reboot- to close everything out and to start over. To go slow in order to go fast again. When this happens, and it happens to all of us, you have a couple of options. First, you can ignore it and muddle through, hoping to avoid the dreaded “blue screen of death.”

Why does time seem to go slower when we’re bored?
-------------------------------------------------

Another theory is that the apparent slowing down of time is a kind of signal our brain sends to itself to convey that the current situation is unfulfilling and we should do something else.

Why does the speed of time increase gradually?
----------------------------------------------

There is some sense to this theory — it does offer an explanation for why the speed of time seems to increase gradually and evenly, with almost mathematical consistency. One problem with it, however, is that it tries to explain present time purely in terms of past time.
