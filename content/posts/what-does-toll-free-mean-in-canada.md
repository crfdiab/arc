What is a toll free number and how does it work?
------------------------------------------------

What Is a Toll-Free Number and How Does it Work? Toll free numbers are telephone numbers with distinct three-digit codes that can be dialed from landlines with no charge to the person placing the call.

Is the FCC involved in toll free numbers?
-----------------------------------------

The FCC requires that toll-free numbers be portable, meaning that a subscriber can “port,” or move, their number to a new RespOrg when changing service providers. However, the FCC is not involved in the actual assignment of toll-free numbers and cannot access the number database.

Are there any toll free numbers that are interchangeable?
---------------------------------------------------------

Although 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844 and 833 are all toll free codes, they are not interchangeable. Dialing a number using a 1-800 prefix would reach a different recipient than dialing that number using a 1-888 prefix. Calls to each toll free number are routed to a particular local telephone number. How are toll free numbers assigned?

How does a CAC work on a toll free call?
----------------------------------------

This CAC, when entered before a phone number, leads to the call being routed to this specific carrier. When making toll-free calls, the originating (“from”) party dips the SMS800 database to determine which CIC (toll free network provider, aka IXC) the toll-free voice call should route through.
