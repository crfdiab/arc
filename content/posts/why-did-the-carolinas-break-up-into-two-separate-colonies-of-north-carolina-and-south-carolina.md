Why did the Carolinas break up into two separate colonies of North Carolina and South Carolina?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Lords Proprietors knew Carolina was too big for just one assembly to govern. The distance between the two North Carolina settlements and South Carolina’s Charles Town caused the Lords Proprietors decide to split the two areas.

How are North Carolina and South Carolina different?
----------------------------------------------------

North Carolina is geographically larger, and has the bigger, and perhaps slightly more diverse, population; South Carolina is smaller, both in population and size, but is a bit more affordable than North Carolina. Most other factors are the same, including climate, recreation opportunities, and popularity.

Is the state of South Carolina the same as North Carolina?
----------------------------------------------------------

Although they both share the ‘Carolina’ in their names, North Carolina and South Carolina are separate states in the US.

When did North Carolina and South Carolina separate?
----------------------------------------------------

In 1729, North and South Carolina were officially recognized as separate royal colonies until the Revolutionary War. Other than this horror show of a beginning and total inability of its early leaders to agree on anything, there does not seem to be any significant reason for the split.

What did North Carolina have in common with South Carolina?
-----------------------------------------------------------

North Carolina found that its tobacco and naval stores, shipped from poor harbours, offered much less revenue than South Carolina’s staples. It had no merchants and ship captains to match those of Charleston, and it had very few great planters.

What was Sherman’s plan for the Carolinas?
------------------------------------------

Also in the Carolinas were cavalry forces from the division of Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton and a small number in Wilmington, North Carolina, under Gen. Braxton Bragg . Sherman’s plan was to bypass the minor Confederate troop concentrations at Augusta, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, and reach Goldsboro, North Carolina, by March 15.
