How are vegetation zones divided in the United States?
------------------------------------------------------

Vegetation zones divide land according to temperature and precipitation. Most gardeners look at a map of vegetation zones before planting any flowers, trees, or vegetables. The United States, for example, is usually divided into 10 vegetation zones. Zone 1 is the coldest zone and supports plants like aspen. Zone 10 is the warmest zone.

How are plant communities assembled in a vegetation zone?
---------------------------------------------------------

An extensive, even transcontinental, band of physiognomically similar vegetation on the earth’s surface. Plant communities assembled into regional patterns by the area’s physiography, geological parent material, and history. Want to thank TFD for its existence?
