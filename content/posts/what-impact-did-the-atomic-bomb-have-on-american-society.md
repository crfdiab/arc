What impact did the atomic bomb have on American society?
---------------------------------------------------------

The uranium bomb detonated over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 had an explosive yield equal to 15,000 tonnes of TNT. It razed and burnt around 70 per cent of all buildings and caused an estimated 140,000 deaths by the end of 1945, along with increased rates of cancer and chronic disease among the survivors.

How do nuclear weapons affect society?
--------------------------------------

A nuclear weapon detonation in or near a populated area would – as a result of the blast wave, intense heat, and radiation and radioactive fallout – cause massive death and destruction, trigger large-scale displacement\[6\] and cause long-term harm to human health and well-being, as well as long-term damage to the …

How do atomic bombs affect the environment?
-------------------------------------------

A detonated nuclear bomb produces a fireball, shockwaves and intense radiation. A mushroom cloud forms from vaporized debris and disperses radioactive particles that fall to earth contaminating air, soil, water and the food supply. When carried by wind currents, fallout can cause far-reaching environmental damage.

What were some effects of the first use of the atomic bomb?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Radiation Thermal radiation accompanied the flash, resulting in severe burns and eye injuries. Ionizing radiation caused wide-sweeping sickness that appeared weeks after the initial bombing. War II resulted in unprecedented numbers of casualties, including the persecution of large groups of people.

How did the fear of atomic bombs affect ordinary people’s lives?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Fear of atomic weapons and nuclear fallout helped carve the dread of cancer deep into our hearts, and they put a man on the moon. They helped launch environmentalism, and laid the foundations for the anti-Vietnam war movement.

What does the atomic bomb represent?
------------------------------------

The atomic bombing of Japan was a hugely significant final act of the most destructive global conflict in human history. Simultaneously, it signalled the dawn of the atomic age, the arms race between the US and the Soviet Union and – before too long – the cold war.

How does nuclear bomb kill you?
-------------------------------

Whole body doses cause damage to epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract and this combined with the bone marrow damage is fatal. All symptoms become increasingly severe, causing exhaustion and emaciation in a few days and death within 7–14 days from loss of water and electrolytes.

What was the environmental impact of the atomic bomb on Japan?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Radiation emission was the biggest environmental impact caused by these atomic bombs. The water was polluted with high cloudiness, coloured, hazardous taste, odour, unsuitable pH level and much more.

What war was the atomic bomb used in?
-------------------------------------

World War II  
Though the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan marked the end of World War II, many historians argue that it also ignited the Cold War. Since 1940, the United States had been working on developing an atomic weapon, after having been warned that Nazi Germany was already conducting research into nuclear weapons.

How did the atomic bomb cause tension?
--------------------------------------

In 1949, the USSR tested its first atomic bomb. This led to a race between the two superpowers to amass the most powerful nuclear weapons with the most effective delivery systems. Tension was greatly increased as a result of the developing arms race which served to militarise both sides and bring war closer.

How atomic bomb changed the world?
----------------------------------

Mustard Gas – The Weapons That Changed The World The world would never be the same again. The uranium bomb dropped on Hiroshima killed more than 140,000 people within months. Many more would later die from radiation-related illnesses. The heat explosion burnt the shadows of the dead into the pavements of the city.

What was the result of the invention of the atomic bomb?
--------------------------------------------------------

The project led to the invention of nuclear weapons, including two that were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing or injuring over 200,000 people.

How did the atomic bombings of Hiroshima change the world?
----------------------------------------------------------

How the Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Changed the World. In August 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on two Japanese cities. The first was detonated over Hiroshima on 6 August at approximately 8.15am. Then, just three days later, a second atomic strike laid waste to Nagasaki.

What was the impact of the atomic bomb on medicine?
---------------------------------------------------

Among the breakthroughs linked to atomic research that Creager highlights in “Life Atomic”: treatments for cancer, especially using cobalt-60; diagnostic tests still used widely in medicine; an understanding of metabolic pathways, such as that for photosynthesis;

What is the impact of technology ( nuclear weapons )?
-----------------------------------------------------

This technological change is marked by the advent of atomic or nuclear weapons. It has brought jet aircraft with intercontinental range and supersonic speed, missiles with nuclear warheads, and nuclear powered planes and submarines with unlimited range and with guidance to specific targets anywhere in the world.
