Is neptunium shiny or dull?
---------------------------

Neptunium, a silvery metal, exists in three crystalline modifications; the room-temperature form (alpha) is orthorhombic.

Can you touch Plutonium with bare hands?
----------------------------------------

People can handle amounts on the order of a few kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium (I personally have done so) without receiving a dangerous dose. You don’t just hold bare Pu in your bare hands though, the Pu is cladded with some other metal (like zirconium), and you generally wear gloves when handling it.

Can you hold Plutonium in your bare hands?
------------------------------------------

A: Plutonium is, in fact, a metal very like uranium. If you hold it \[in\] your hand (and I’ve held tons of it my hand, a pound or two at a time), it’s heavy, like lead. It’s toxic, like lead or arsenic, but not much more so.

What are 2 interesting facts about neptunium?
---------------------------------------------

Neptunium – The Key Facts Neptunium is a radioactive metal in the actinide series. Its name is derived from the planet Neptune. Neptune is the next planet out from the Sun after Uranus, just like neptunium is the next element in the periodic table after uranium.

Is neptunium a natural element?
-------------------------------

Neptunium is a ductile, silvery, radioactive metal. Neptunium occurs naturally in Earth, being present in minute quantities in uranium ores. Today neptunium-237 is extracted in kg quantities from the spent uranium fuel rods of nuclear reactors.

Is neptunium found naturally?
-----------------------------

Natural abundance Neptunium is obtained as a by-product from nuclear reactors. It is extracted from the spent uranium fuel rods. Trace quantities occur naturally in uranium ores.

What is the structure of the metal neptunium?
---------------------------------------------

Neptunium is a silvery radioactive synthetic metal. (Miniscule quantities of neptunium-237 and neptunium-239 are found in nature as a result of beta decay of uranium.) Neptunium exists in three allotropes: it has an orthorhombic structure at normal temperatures, a tetragonal structure above 280 o C and a cubic structure above 577 o C. (2)

When was the chemical element neptunium discovered?
---------------------------------------------------

The chemical element neptunium is classed as an actinide metal. It was discovered in 1940 by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson. Neptunium was the first synthetic transuranium element (elements after uranium) of the actinide series to be discovered.

Is the element neptunium harmful to the environment?
----------------------------------------------------

Neptunium is harmful due to its radioactivity. Neptunium is a silvery radioactive synthetic metal. (Miniscule quantities of neptunium-237 and neptunium-239 are found in nature as a result of beta decay of uranium.)

What is the texture like of Neptune’s surface?
----------------------------------------------

Neptune doesn’t necessarily have a texture it is made out of gas….. What is the texture like of Neptune’s surface? Neptune does not have a surface; it is a gas planet. What is Neptune’s texture?
