What did the UN launch in 2016?
-------------------------------

News on Millennium Development Goals As the MDGs era comes to a conclusion with the end of the year, 2016 ushers in the official launch of the bold and transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by world leaders last September at the United Nations.

--------------------------------

17 Sustainable Development Goals
