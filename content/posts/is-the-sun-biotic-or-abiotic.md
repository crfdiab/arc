Is the sun biotic or abiotic?
-----------------------------

Abiotic factors are non-living things that “live” in an ecosystem that affect both the ecosystem and its surroundings. Some examples of Abiotic factors are the sun, rocks, water, and sand. Biotic factors are living organisms that affect other living organisms.

Why is the sun biotic?
----------------------

No, but it is Abiotic. Biotic factors are living organisms that affect other living organisms. Some examples of Biotic factors are fish, insects, and animals.

Is rain a biotic or abiotic?
----------------------------

Abiotic factors are parts of the environment that affect living organisms and ecosystems, while not being alive themselves, like rocks, wind, temperature, and rain. Biotic factors are living parts of the environment that affect other organisms. These include plants, animals and fungi.

Is a heat abiotic or biotic?
----------------------------

Abiotic factors are the physical and chemical conditions of an environment. For example : heat, salinity, pressure, light, wind, pH Biotic factors are all the biological conditions of an environment for a specie/taxa.

How does the Sun play a role in abiotic factors?
------------------------------------------------

The Sun plays a major role in many abiotic factors but each factor can also be influenced by other abiotic and biotic factors. The atmospheric temperature on the Earth’s surface generally varies between -50°C and 50°C (-60°F to 120°F), with the majority of life living within more comfortable mid-range temperatures.

How are abiotic factors different from biotic factors?
------------------------------------------------------

Abiotic is referred to all nonliving parts of an ecosystem. Biotic factors depend on abiotic factors to survive for their survival. Abiotic factors don’t rely on the biotic factors for their survival. Directly or indirectly affect the individual species, community, biosphere, the population of species and ecosystem.

Where do abiotic components originate in the hydrosphere?
---------------------------------------------------------

Abiotic components originate from the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere Discover more about Abiotic and Biotic factors, their meaning, the difference between abiotic and biotic resources and other related topics only at BYJU’S Biology

Why is wind an important abiotic factor for plants?
---------------------------------------------------

In areas where rain is rare, such as deserts, life can be a real struggle for plants and animals, and many species have amazing adaptations for finding or storing water. Wind is an important factor because it increases evaporation and can make it difficult for plants to survive in a windy area.
