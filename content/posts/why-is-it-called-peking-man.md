Why is it called Peking Man?
----------------------------

Peking man, extinct hominin of the species Homo erectus, known from fossils found at Zhoukoudian near Beijing. Peking man was identified as a member of the human lineage by Davidson Black in 1927 on the basis of a single tooth. The limb bones are indistinguishable from those of modern humans. …

How many years ago did Peking Man live?
---------------------------------------

During excavations near Peking (Beijing), China, between 1929 and 1937, researchers discovered several partial skulls of the species Homo erectus. These hominids lived around 400,000 years ago and came to be known as Peking Man.

Who named Sinanthropus pekinensis?
----------------------------------

Davidson Black  
Many more fossils were found in the area, and Canadian paleontologist Davidson Black named this new ancestor Sinanthropus pekinensis, “Peking Man” (after the city of Beijing, spelled Peking before the Pinyin romanization system was adopted. The city was also known as Beiping or Peiping from 1928 to 1949).

Why is Peking Man so important?
-------------------------------

The Peking Man discovery is celebrated as a major step forward in the theory of human origin and evolution. The Zhoukoudian caves, widely considered to be the most intact Homo erectus dwelling in the world, were opened in 1921 and the first Homo erectus remains were uncovered in 1929. …

How was Peking Man dated?
-------------------------

The dating method is based on the radioactive decay of 26Al and 10Be isotopes. While they’re on Earth’s surface, the two isotopes within the quartz are produced at a known ratio through exposure to cosmic radiation. When sediment buries the quartz, the generation of isotopes by cosmic rays nearly stops.

Which hominin species was the most successful?
----------------------------------------------

It was also the first known hominin to migrate out of Africa, and possibly the first to cook food. In terms of species survival, Homo erectus is a huge success story. Fossil evidence for H. erectus stretches over more than 1.5 million years, making it by far the longest surviving of all our human relatives.

Who was the first true man?
---------------------------

The First Humans One of the earliest known humans is Homo habilis, or “handy man,” who lived about 2.4 million to 1.4 million years ago in Eastern and Southern Africa.

Who was the first ape man?

When was Peking Man listed as a World Heritage Site?
----------------------------------------------------

The Peking Man Site at Zhoukoudian was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1987. New excavations were started at the site in June 2009. The most complete fossils, all of which were portions of the skullcap ( calvariae ), are:

When did Davidson Black discover the Peking Man?
------------------------------------------------

Peking man was identified as a member of the human lineage by Davidson Black in 1927 on the basis of a single tooth. Later excavations yielded several skullcaps and mandibles, facial and limb bones, and the teeth of about 40 individuals. Evidence suggests that the Zhoukoudian fossils date from about 770,000 to 230,000 years ago.
