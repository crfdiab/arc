What happens when a tornado is formed?
--------------------------------------

A tornado is a violent rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. The most violent tornadoes are capable of tremendous destruction with wind speeds of up to 300 mph. They can destroy large buildings, uproot trees and hurl vehicles hundreds of yards. They can also drive straw into trees.

How does a tornado form and end?
--------------------------------

Tornadoes form when warm, humid air collides with cold, dry air. The denser cold air is pushed over the warm air, usually producing thunderstorms. The warm air rises through the colder air, causing an updraft. When it touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.

What is necessary for tornado formation?
----------------------------------------

There are four main factors that must be present for a thunderstorm to produce a tornado and these are shear, lift, instability and moisture.

How are tornadoes formed and how are they formed?
-------------------------------------------------

How Tornadoes Form. Tornadoes are usually born from thunderstorms. High intensity tornadoes form from supercell thunderstorms, a storm that has a ” deep rotating mesocyclone .”. Supercell thunderstorms are usually when you’ll hear a tornado warning. A regular thunderstorm will hit before a supercell and for this to occur,…

What makes a tornado form in a supercell?
-----------------------------------------

That allows a tornado to form. Most tornadoes form during supercell thunderstorms, but not all supercell thunderstorms produce tornadoes. Usually, the rotating air near the ground doesn’t rotate fast enough, for a tornado to form.

What are the conditions needed for a tornado to form?
-----------------------------------------------------

conditiOns Needed to fOrm a tornado. Abundant low level moisture is necessary to contribute to the development of a thunderstorm. A “trigger” (perhaps a cold front or other low level zone of converging winds) is needed to lift the moist air aloft.

How is a funnel cloud different from a tornado?
-----------------------------------------------

A funnel cloud is a rotating cone-shaped column of air extending downward from the base of a thunderstorm, but not touching the ground. When it reaches the ground it is called a tornado. A supercell thunderstorm is a long-lived thunderstorm whose updrafts and downdrafts are in near balance.
