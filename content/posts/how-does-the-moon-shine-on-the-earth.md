How does the moon shine on the earth?
-------------------------------------

The Moon gets its light from the Sun. In the same way that the Sun illuminates Earth, the Moon reflects the Sun’s light, making it appear bright in our sky. Have your child hold the fruit at arm’s length, pointing at the light.

How is the Sun shining on the moon?
-----------------------------------

Unlike a lamp or our sun, the moon doesn’t produce its own light. Moonlight is actually sunlight that shines on the moon and bounces off. The light reflects off old volcanoes, craters, and lava flows on the moon’s surface. Visit the Ask Dr.

Can the moon shine without the Sun?
-----------------------------------

The Moon can only be seen as a result of the Sun’s light reflecting off it. It does not produce any light of its own.

How does the Sun and moon help the Earth?
-----------------------------------------

The Sun’s influence on tides is just under half as strong as the Moon’s. When the Sun, Moon and Earth are all lined up, the Sun and Moon work together to produce ‘spring’ tides (though confusingly they don’t have to happen in spring).

What happens when you shine a light on the Moon?
------------------------------------------------

Shine the flashlight on the Moon (small ball). Notice the light lands on the ball. Predict what will happen when the Earth travels between the Sun and the Moon. Place the Earth (large ball) in between the Sun and the Moon. What happens? The Earth blocks the Sun, so the Moon appears covered. This is a lunar eclipse.

How does the Moon play the role of the Sun?
-------------------------------------------

And the flashlight plays the role of the sun. Shine the flashlight on the Earth (large ball). Notice the light lands on the ball. Predict what will happen when the Moon travels between the Sun and the Earth. Place the Moon (small ball) in between the Sun and the Earth. What happens? The Moon blocks the Sun. This is a solar eclipse.

Is there going to be a sun and a moon?
--------------------------------------

There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. (Revelation 22:5) The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.

How are the Sun and Moon and earth related?
-------------------------------------------

It was a fun, dizzying illustration. You can simulate a solar eclipse and lunar eclipse in your own house. The large ball represents the Earth. The small ball represents the Moon. And the flashlight plays the role of the sun. Shine the flashlight on the Earth (large ball). Notice the light lands on the ball.
