Trash mountain In India, about 70% of the plastic the country consumes is simply discarded. Large amounts end up in the water by way of the River Ganges, which comes second only to China’s Yangtze in the amount of plastic it contributed to the world’s oceans, according to a 2017 study.

Why does India want to burn its trash?

Where does the trash in Delhi come from?

The trash no longer comes directly from the streets of Delhi but via the Timarpur Okhla Waste Management Plant.

The ash is what’s left over.
