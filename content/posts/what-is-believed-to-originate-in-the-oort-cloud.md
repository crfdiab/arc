What is believed to originate in the Oort Cloud?
------------------------------------------------

Very long-period comets, such as C/1999 F1 (Catalina), whose orbits last for millions of years, are thought to originate directly from the outer Oort cloud. Comets pass from the scattered disc into the realm of the outer planets, becoming what are known as centaurs.

What best describes the Oort Cloud?
-----------------------------------

The Oort Cloud is approximately spherical and is known to be the centre of much of the long-term comets. Explanation: The Oort Cloud is an expansive house of frozen bodies at the extreme edge of the solar system. The Oort Cloud is approximately spherical and is known to be the centre of much of the long-term comets.

What is the Oort Cloud quizlet?
-------------------------------

The Oort Cloud is an extended shell of icy objects that exist in the outermost reaches of the solar system. It is named after astronomer Jan Oort, who first theorized its existence. The Oort Cloud is roughly spherical, and is the origin of most of the long-period comets that have been observed.

How did the Oort cloud come to be?
----------------------------------

Oort cloud is believed to be made from the leftover debris when the Solar system was formed some 4.6 billion years ago. Think of it as the biggest junkyard in space. It is a cloud of the earliest rocks and icy objects dating back to the beginning of our Solar system.

Is the Oort cloud in the Kuiper belt?
-------------------------------------

The Oort Cloud. The Oort Cloud lies far beyond Pluto and the most distant edges of the Kuiper Belt. While the planets of our solar system orbit in a flat plane, the Oort Cloud is believed to be a giant spherical shell surrounding the Sun, planets and Kuiper Belt Objects.

Are there any dwarf planets in the Oort cloud?
----------------------------------------------

One such object is Sedna which is currently classified as planetoid and a candidate for a dwarf planet status in the inner Oort cloud. It has an extremely long and elongated orbit, taking approximately 11,400 years to complete a full orbit around the Sun.

What is the distance between the Sun and the Oort cloud?
--------------------------------------------------------

To appreciate the distance to the Oort Cloud, it’s helpful to set aside miles and kilometers and instead use the astronomical unit, or AU — a unit defined as the distance between Earth and the Sun, with 1 AU being roughly 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.
