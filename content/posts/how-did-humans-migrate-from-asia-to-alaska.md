Crossing From Asia, the First Americans Rushed Into the Unknown. One group turned and headed north, following the retreating glaciers into Canada and back to Alaska. The other branch took a remarkable journey south. The genetic data suggest that this group spread swiftly across much of North America and South America about 14,000 years ago.
