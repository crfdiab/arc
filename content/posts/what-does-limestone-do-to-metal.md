What does limestone do to metal?
--------------------------------

The calcium carbonate in the limestone reacts with the silicon dioxide to form calcium silicate (also known as slag). Molten calcium silicate is less dense than the molten iron so it floats on top of the iron and can easily be removed. Limestone can be crushed and used to build roads.

Is limestone used in steel making?
----------------------------------

In iron and steel Industry, limestone and dolomite are used both in ironmaking and steelmaking. Limestone and lime products are used as fluxing material both in ironmaking and in steelmaking. Further lime from limestone reacts with the S present in the raw materials to form calcium sulphide (CaS) which goes into slag.

How much CaO is in limestone?
-----------------------------

Based on the chemical analysis of the limestone in our example (i.e. calcium oxide, CaO = 45.50% and magnesium oxide, MgO = 8.16%), this calculation assumes that all the calcium and magnesium is present as carbonates – whereas, a small, and probably insignificant, amount may occur as silicates etc.

Does limestone corrode metal?
-----------------------------

Metals prone to acid corrosion include carbon steel, zinc, aluminum and copper. Carbonate stones, such as limestone and marble, are also corroded by acidic solutions. Some workers think that the process of limestone decay is an electrochemical one exactly like metal corrosion.

What is silicon in steel?
-------------------------

Silicon. Silicon is perhaps the most common alloying element in steel, as almost all steel requires silicon during the manufacturing process. Silicon helps to purify the iron ore during the smelting process by deoxidizing it and removing other impurities from it.

How much does a cubic meter of limestone weigh?
-----------------------------------------------

Limestone weighs 2.711 gram per cubic centimeter or 2 711 kilogram per cubic meter, i.e. density of limestone is equal to 2 711 kg/m³; at 25.2°C (77.36°F or 298.35K) at standard atmospheric pressure . In Imperial or US customary measurement system, the density is equal to 169.2 pound per…

Do you need to know the properties of limestone?
------------------------------------------------

You also should be able to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using limestone, cement and concrete when compared to other building materials. You don’t need to learn the properties of a load of other materials, the data you need will be given to you in the exam.

What kind of crystal is limestone made of?
------------------------------------------

Limestone is an odorless and tasteless powder or hexagonal crystal. Also known as: Calcite ; Calcium Carbonate ; Calcium Milk ; Chalk ; Marble ; Marble, solid ; Milk of Calcium ; Vaterite. 1. Compound summary: Limestone.

Where does most of the limestone in the world come from?
--------------------------------------------------------

It was formed millions of years ago on the bed of relatively shallow tropical seas. It consists mainly of the mineral calcium carbonate which comes from two sources – shells and precipitation from seawater. There are many types of limestone, some hard, some soft.
