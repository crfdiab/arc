What did the Domesday survey reveal?
------------------------------------

By studying Domesday Book, we can find out who controlled the land in England. In 1086 only a handful of English people held land. King William, his tenants-in-chief or the church had power over most of it. This shows us how thoroughly the Normans had taken over England by 1086.

What does Domesday mean in history?
-----------------------------------

/ ˈdumzˌdeɪ ˌbʊk, ˈdoʊmz- / PHONETIC RESPELLING. noun. a record of a survey of the lands of England made by order of William the Conqueror about 1086, giving ownership, extent, value, etc., of the properties.

Did the Domesday survey cover the whole country?
------------------------------------------------

It was an exercise unparalleled in contemporary Europe, and was not matched in its comprehensive coverage of the country until the population censuses of the 19th century – although Domesday itself is not a full population census, and the names that appear in it are mainly only those of people who owned land.

Why was the Domesday book called the Great and Little Book?
-----------------------------------------------------------

‘Domesday Book’ is the collective term for these two volumes: the Great and Little Domesday Book. Why is it called Domesday Book? During the lifetimes of the Conqueror and his sons, royal officials employed politically correct language when describing Domesday Book.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

What were the real reasons why William organised the Domesday survey? In this active lesson pupils start by speculating possible motives (given a couple of clues) and then work in groups of four to discover the full range of ideas historians have put forward.

What was included in the Domesday Book of 1086?
-----------------------------------------------

The Domesday survey covered all of England as it existed in 1086, which included a small part of what is now Wales, some of Cumbria, but excluded the present day Northumbria. The entries for some major towns at the time like the important Winchester and London failed to make it into the book.

Is the Domesday Book available on the Internet?
-----------------------------------------------

In 2011, the Open Domesday site made the manuscript available online. The book is an invaluable primary source for modern historians and historical economists.
