Who named the Beagle Channel?
-----------------------------

Charles Darwin  
The Beagle Channel was named for the British ship Beagle, in which Charles Darwin explored the area (1833–34).

Why is the Beagle Canal so important?
-------------------------------------

As one of three navigable passages around South America between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, it became a main route for global trade, while between the 1950s until 1984, the Beagle Channel was at the center of a long-running territorial conflict between Chile and Argentina.

Why is the Beagle Canal so important for Chile?
-----------------------------------------------

The Beagle conflict is seen as the main reason for Chilean support to the United Kingdom during the Falklands War of 1982. The conflict began in 1904 with the first official Argentine claims over the islands that had always been under Chilean control.

Where does the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean meet?
-----------------------------------------------------

OK, so we know where the oceans meet – but how can you tell the difference? According to topographers, the line that marks the border between the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean runs straight between Cape Horn and Antarctica. This narrow body of water is called the Drake Strait, after the Elizabethan explorer, Sir Francis Drake.

When was the Atlantic and Pacific oceans separated?
---------------------------------------------------

The passage is known to have been closed until around 41 million years ago according to a chemical study of fish teeth found in oceanic sedimentary rock. Before the passage opened, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans were entirely separate, with Antarctica being much warmer and having no ice cap.

Which is the most important passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Strait of Magellan is the most-important natural passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Strait of Magellan is a sea route in southern Chile separating mainland South America to the north and Tierra del Fuego to the south.

Is the Southern Ocean an extension of the Atlantic Ocean?
---------------------------------------------------------

The Southern Ocean contains the waters that surround Antarctica and sometimes is considered an extension of Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In 1928, the first edition of the International Hydrographic Organization ‘s (IHO) Limits of Oceans and Seas publication included the Southern Ocean around Antarctica.
