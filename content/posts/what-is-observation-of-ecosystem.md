What are the 10 examples of biotic?

Key Differences (Biotic Factors vs Abiotic Factors)

<table><tr><th>Basis for Comparison</th><th>Biotic factors</th><th>Abiotic factors</th></tr><tr><td>Examples</td><td>Humans, insects, wild animals, birds, bacteria, etc. are some examples of biotic factors.</td><td>Soil, rainfall, humidity, temperature, pH, climate, etc. are some examples of abiotic factors.</td></tr></table>

What is an example of biotic matter?

Which is an example of a biotic resource?

Examples of biotic resources include all the living components present in an ecosystem. These include producers, consumers, decomposers and detritivores. The term abiotic refers to all the non-living factors present in an ecosystem.

What is the difference between biotic and abiotic?
--------------------------------------------------

Biotic means pertains to life. (Remember that Biology is the study of life?) Abiotic means pertaining to no life. Abiotic examples include things that are not alive but you will find in an ecosystem such as air, gases, water, sand, stones and rocks.
