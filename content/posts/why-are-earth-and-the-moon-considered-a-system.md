Why are Earth and the Moon considered a system?
-----------------------------------------------

…addition to its nearness to Earth, the Moon is relatively massive compared with the planet—the ratio of their masses is much larger than those of other natural satellites to the planets that they orbit. The Moon and Earth consequently exert a strong gravitational influence on each other, forming a system…

How does the Moon system work?
------------------------------

Moon phases are determined by the relative positions of the Moon, Earth, and Sun. Instead, the Moon’s phase depends only on its position relative to Earth and the Sun. The Moon doesn’t make its own light, it just reflects the Sun’s light as all the planets do. The Sun always illuminates one half of the Moon.

How big is the Earth-moon system?
---------------------------------

The moon is a bit more than one-fourth (27 percent) the size of Earth, a much larger ratio (1:4) than any other planets and their moons. Earth’s moon is the fifth largest moon in the solar system.

What is the Sun Earth-Moon system?
----------------------------------

The solar system is made up of the Sun, the planets that orbit the Sun, their satellites, dwarf planets and many, many small objects, like asteroids and comets. All of these objects move and we can see these movements.

What is considered a moon?
--------------------------

A moon is defined to be a celestial body that makes an orbit around a planet, including the eight major planets, dwarf planets, and minor planets. A moon may also be referred to as a natural satellite, although to differentiate it from other astronomical bodies orbiting another body, e.g.

Is the Moon a planet or a satellite?
------------------------------------

A moon is defined to be a celestial body that makes an orbit around a planet, including the eight major planets, dwarf planets, and minor planets. A moon may also be referred to as a natural satellite, although to differentiate it from other astronomical bodies orbiting another body, e.g. a planet orbiting a star.

What is the celestial Moon?
