What problems did Eyjafjallajokull cause?
-----------------------------------------

Effects of the eruption within Iceland Areas were flooded because of the glacier melt water which lay above the volcano. Agricultural land was damaged, and farms were hit by heavy ash fall. The ash fall poisoned animals in nearby farms. Some roads were destroyed.

What was one major effect of the volcanic eruption of Mt Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While some ash fell on uninhabited areas in Iceland, most had been carried by westerly winds resulting in the shutdown of large air space over Europe. The shutdown had a knock on impact on the economy and cultural events across Europe.

What are the effects of volcanic ash clouds?
--------------------------------------------

Ash’s abrasive particles can scratch the surface of the skin and eyes, causing discomfort and inflammation. If inhaled, volcanic ash can cause breathing problems and damage the lungs. Inhaling large amounts of ash and volcanic gases can cause a person to suffocate.

What were the environmental effects of the Eyjafjallajokull eruption?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The volcano released approximately 150,000 tonnes of CO2 each day, but the massive reduction of air travel occurring over European skies caused by the ash cloud, saved an estimated 1.3 to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 19 April 2010.

Why was eyjafjallajokull so explosive?
--------------------------------------

As the ice started to melt, glacial water began flooding into the volcano where it met the bubbling magma at the centre of the eruptions. This rapid cooling caused the magma to shear into fine, jagged ash particles.

Why are Jökulhlaups dangerous?
------------------------------

Subglacial volcanic eruptions are especially hazardous because of the large volumes of meltwater that result, and sometimes because of lahars, rapid and damaging mudflows.

Is eyjafjallajökull a shield volcano?
-------------------------------------

Eyjafjallajökull volcano: Geological information Eyjafjallajokull volcano is considered a stratovolcano. What this means is that it’s a conical volcano built over time by layers of various volcanic materials.

What is Eyjafjallajökull and what did it cause?
-----------------------------------------------

Eyjafjallajökull 2010: How Icelandic volcano eruption closed European skies. Ten years ago the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökul erupted, sending a plume of volcanic ash over nine kilometers into the sky. The eruption was relatively small but its impact was massive.

Will Eyjafjallajökull erupt again?
----------------------------------

WILL EYJAFJALLAJÖKULL ERUPT AGAIN? Eyjafjallajokull is an active volcano, meaning it’s still geothermally active and can erupt again in the future. However, this eruption is not likely to occur for a long time.

Where was the ash from the Eyjafjallajokull eruption found?
-----------------------------------------------------------

In early 1823, the nearby volcano Katla under the Mýrdalsjökull ice cap erupted and at the same time steam columns were seen on the summit of Eyjafjallajökull. The ash of Eyjafjallajökull’s 1821 eruptions is to be found all over the south of Iceland.

Why did Iceland volcano cause so much trouble?
----------------------------------------------

Why Iceland Volcano’s Eruption Caused So Much Trouble. Jagged flecks of ash spewed into the air may have boosted the effects of the 2010 eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano, which paralyzed flights across Europe, a new study finds. The ash plume from Eyjafjallajökull caused turmoil in the air for nearly a month.

How is the Eyjafjallajokull volcano related to Katla volcano?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The volcano is thought to be related to Katla geologically, in that eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull have generally been followed by eruptions of Katla. Eyjafjallajökull erupted in the years 920, 1612 and 2010. Some damage was caused by a minor eruption in 1821.

What was the cause of the eyjafjorður eruption in 1822?
-------------------------------------------------------

The period from August to December 1822 seemed quieter, but farmers attributed the death of cattle and sheep in the Eyjafjörður area to poisoning from this eruption, which modern analysis identifies as fluoride poisoning. Some small glacier runs occurred in the river Holtsá. A bigger one flooded the plains near the river Markarfljót.
