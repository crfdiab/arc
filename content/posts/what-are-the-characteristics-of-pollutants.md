What are the characteristics of pollutants?
-------------------------------------------

A3. 3 Characteristics of Pollutants

- A3.3.1 Primary &amp; Secondary Pollutants. Pollutants may be classified as either primary or secondary.
- Primary: Emitted directly from a process.
- Secondary: Formed in the air when pollutants react with each other, but are not directly emitted.
- A3.3.2 Physical Nature of Pollutants. What are the characteristics of important air pollutants?
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    Air Pollution Characteristics
    
    
    - Plant Life. Sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other air pollutants can enter the pores of developing plants and break down the waxy coating that protects them from disease and excess water loss.
    - Aerial Transport.
    - Natural Causes.
    - Other Natural Causes. What are the 2 primary pollutants?
        ----------------------------------
        
        Types of primary pollutants include:
        
        
        - Nitrogen oxides (NOx)
        - Carbon monoxide (CO)
        - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
        - Sulfur oxides (SOx)
        - Particulate matter (PM)
        - Mercury.
        - and more. What is the most common pollutant?
            ----------------------------------
            
            Most Common Air Pollutants
            
            
            - Carbon Monoxide.
            - Nitrogen Dioxide (EPA)
            - Ozone (EPA)
            - Particulate Matter.
            - Lead (EPA)
            - Sulfur Dioxide.
            - Six Common Pollutants (EPA) How are the different types of pollution different?
                ---------------------------------------------------
                
                 The different types of pollutants are: 1 Primary Pollutants: These are the pollutants that are emitted directly from the sources such as volcanic eruptions,… 2 Secondary Pollutants: These are the pollutants that are not directly emitted from the sources but are formed when… More …
                
                What are some of the effects of pollution?
                ------------------------------------------
                
                Effects of Pollution Pollution causes different types of diseases such as typhoid, tuberculosis, cancer, nerve diseases, etc. It causes economic loss and energy loss which results in the ultimate loss of wealth. Adverse air pollution can cause various diseases killing many organisms including humans.
                
                Which is the best description of a primary pollutant?
                -----------------------------------------------------
                
                Pollutants may be classified as either primary or secondary. Primary: Emitted directly from a process. E.g. ash from a volcanic eruption. E.g. carbon monoxide gas from a vehicle exhaust. Secondary: Formed in the air when pollutants react with each other, but are not directly emitted.
                
                What are some examples of pollutants in water?
                ----------------------------------------------
                
                In addition, raw sewage is a major pollutant of water. It has a very negative impact on water quality and can cause a lot of deadly diseases. This happens because sometimes it mixes with drinking water supply posing a threat to life. Other than that, we have the trash which ends up in the water due to improper disposal.
