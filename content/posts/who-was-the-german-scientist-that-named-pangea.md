Who was the German scientist that named Pangea?
-----------------------------------------------

Alfred Wegener  
Alfred Wegener (November 1, 1880–November 1930) was a German meteorologist and geophysicist who developed the first theory of continental drift and formulated the idea that a supercontinent known as Pangaea existed on the Earth millions of years ago.

Who is the German scientist that came up with the theory of the continental drift?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The theory of continental drift is most associated with the scientist Alfred Wegener.

Who discovered the supercontinent theory?
-----------------------------------------

scientist Alfred Wegener  
More than a century ago, the scientist Alfred Wegener proposed the notion of an ancient supercontinent, which he named Pangaea (sometimes spelled Pangea), after putting together several lines of evidence.

Who came up with the Pangaea theory?
------------------------------------

meteorologist Alfred Wegener  
Pangea’s existence was first proposed in 1912 by German meteorologist Alfred Wegener as a part of his theory of continental drift.

When did Alfred Wegener come up with the idea of the supercontinent?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In 1912 a German meteorologist named Alfred Wegener (1880-1931) hypothesized a single proto-supercontinent that divided up into the continents we now know because of continental drift and plate tectonics.

Who was the first person to formulate the continental drift hypothesis?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

German meteorologist and geophysicist Alfred Wegener was the first person to formulate a complete statement of the continental drift hypothesis.

When did abriham Ortelius propose the idea of continents drifting?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Although Abriham Ortelius previously proposed the idea of continents ‘drifting’ Wegener had thought it through in greater detail. He started gathering evidence and found that they fell into three categories, geological, biological and climatological.

When did all the continents form a supercontinent?
--------------------------------------------------

More than 2,000,000 years ago, in the late Triassic Period, Pangaea broke apart. Although Pangaea is a hypothesis, the idea that all the continents once formed a single supercontinent makes sense when you look at the shapes of the continents and how well they essentially fit together.
