Do predators help prey?
-----------------------

While we assume predation decreases prey density, we find that predators can indeed help prey persist if they sufficiently increase prey adaptedness (decrease phenotypic lag).

Why are predators important to the well being of their prey as well as the entire ecological community?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

predators are important to the well-being of their prey as well as the entire ecological community because predators contribute to population control. predators usually pick out the youngest, oldest, or sickest individuals, which increases the overall health of the prey population.

How do predators influence prey populations?
--------------------------------------------

As predator populations increase, they put greater strain on the prey populations and act as a top-down control, pushing them toward a state of decline. Thus both availability of resources and predation pressure affect the size of prey populations.

What is the relationship between predator and prey and why is it important?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Predator-prey relations are an important driving force to improve the fitness of both predator and prey. In terms of evolution, the predator-prey relationship continues to be beneficial in forcing both species to adapt to ensure that they feed without becoming a meal for another predator.

Do predators really only kill the old and sick prey?
----------------------------------------------------

Predators don’t necessarily prey only on the ill/ injured. Sick prey may be overlooked because their bodies may not provide the necessary sustence for the predator and others it may be feeding. Healthy large slow moving animals may be difficult to kill but the payoff is greater, especially if a pack is involved.

What would happen if top predators were removed?
------------------------------------------------

The most obvious result of the removal of the top predators in an ecosystem is a population explosion in the prey species. When prey becomes more scarce, the predator population declines until prey is again more abundant. Therefore, the two balance each other. When the predators are removed, prey populations explode.

What causes the prey population to decrease?
--------------------------------------------

Predation and Population As the prey population increases, there is more food for predators. So, after a slight lag, the predator population increases as well. As the number of predators increases, more prey are captured. As a result, the prey population starts to decrease.

What is the predator/prey theory?
---------------------------------

Predator-prey theory is traced from its origins in the Malthus-Verhulst lo- gistic equation, through the Lotka-Volterra equations, logistic modifications to both prey and predator equations, incorporation of the Michaelis-Menten-Holling functional response into the predator and prey equations, and the recent …

How can introduction of new predator cause species to go extinct?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The population size (number) of a predator species is directly controlled by the availability of a food source (prey). The more prey available, the greater growth in the number of predator species. How can the introduction of a new predator cause a species to go extinct?

How are predators and prey adapted to survive?
----------------------------------------------

Both predators and prey have adaptations to predation that evolve through natural selection. Predator adaptations help them capture prey. Prey adaptations help them avoid predators. A common adaptation in both predator and prey is camouflage.

Which is an example of predator and prey?
-----------------------------------------

As an example, for many decades, prairie dogs were despised in the western US. These are ground squirrels that create colonies or ‘towns’ that can number in the hundreds, thousands, or even millions. A network of interconnecting tunnels is dug underground with numerous entrances.

How does a predator / prey relationship control population?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Predation provides energy to prolong the life and promote the reproduction of the organism that does the killing, the predator, to the detriment of the organism being consumed, the prey. At the level of the community, predation reduces the number of individuals in the prey population.
