How widespread was the damage of Mt St Helens?
----------------------------------------------

Helens erupted in Washington state. The eruption would quickly become the deadliest in U.S. history, killing 57 people. The destruction caused more than $1 billion in damage.

How far away was the furthest victim from Mt St Helens?
-------------------------------------------------------

During the eruption, 57 people were killed. 7: How far away was the furthest victim? The farthest victim was about 13 miles away.

How far away were trees blown down Mt St Helens?
------------------------------------------------

On a quiet, sunny Sunday morning 30 years ago, at 8:32 a.m., Mount St. Helens erupted. The blast that May 18 and the flooding that followed killed 57 people, some more than 10 miles away. Nearly 230 square miles of forest was blown down by the blast or buried under hot ash, mud and other volcanic debris.

What was the effect of the eruption of Mount St Helens?
-------------------------------------------------------

However, a period of dormancy from 1857 until the 1980 eruption had led people to lay aside any fears of the mountain. The homes they had built at the base of the volcano were destroyed when the volcano erupted. In addition, the eruption caused serious economic hardship for many in the area.

How big was the landslide at Mt St Helens?
------------------------------------------

The May 18 eruption began with an earthquake that caused the northern flank of the mountain to collapse, producing the largest landslide in recorded history. The avalanche buried 14 miles (23 kilometers) of the North Fork Toutle River with an average of 150 feet (46 meters)—but in places up to 600 feet (180 meters)—of rocks, dirt, and trees.

How big was the ashfall from Mt St Helens?
------------------------------------------

Forecasting Ashfall Impacts from a Yellowstone Supereruption Yellowstone is one of a few dozen volcanoes on earth capable of “supereruptions” that expel more than 1,000 cubic km of ash and debris. The plumes from such eruptions can rise 30 to 50 km into the atmosphere, three to five times as high as most jets fly.

How big was the pyroclastic flow after Mount St Helens?
