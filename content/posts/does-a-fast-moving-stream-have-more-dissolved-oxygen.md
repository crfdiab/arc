Does a fast moving stream have more dissolved oxygen?
-----------------------------------------------------

Rapidly moving water, such as in a mountain stream or large river, tends to contain a lot of dissolved oxygen, whereas stagnant water contains less. Bacteria in water can consume oxygen as organic matter decays.

What affects oxygen solubility in water?
----------------------------------------

The actual amount of dissolved oxygen (in mg/L) will vary depending on temperature, pressure and salinity ¹. First, the solubility of oxygen decreases as temperature increases ¹. This means that warmer surface water requires less dissolved oxygen to reach 100% air saturation than does deeper, cooler water.

Why does oxygen dissolve in water?
----------------------------------

Oxygen dissolves in surface water due to the aerating action of winds. Oxygen is also introduced into the water as a byproduct of aquatic plant photosynthesis. When dissolved oxygen becomes too low, fish and other aquatic organisms cannot survive. As the water becomes warmer, less oxygen can be dissolved in the water.

What is the solubility of oxygen in water?
------------------------------------------

Oxygen solubility in pure or fresh water at 25 °C and 1.0 atm of O2 pressure is about 1.22 × 10−3 mol dm−3 (the values are varied from 1.18 to 1.25 mol dm−3 as reported in different literature).

Why high dissolved oxygen is bad?
---------------------------------

The greater the BOD, the more rapidly oxygen is depleted in the stream, because microorganisms are using up the DO. This means less oxygen is available to higher forms of aquatic life. The consequences of high BOD are the same as those for low dissolved oxygen: aquatic organisms become stressed, suffocate, and die.

Does oxygen appear to be soluble in water?
------------------------------------------

Oxygen is relatively insoluble in water, its solubility being only 264 µM at 25 °C. That explains in part why you (and fish) require dedicated oxygen carriers in your blood to transfer sufficient oxygen around your body.

Why oxygen is not very soluble in water?
----------------------------------------

Oxygen has such low solubility in water because it is a non-polar molecule and water is polar.

What does oxygen solubility mean?
---------------------------------

The oxygen solubility, SO2 \[µM/kPa\], expresses the oxygen concentration in solution in equilibrium with the oxygen pressure in a gas phase, as a function of temperature and composition of the solution. The inverse of oxygen solubility is related to the activity of dissolved oxygen.

What is a good dissolved oxygen level?
--------------------------------------

Healthy water should generally have dissolved oxygen concentrations above 6.5-8 mg/L and between about 80-120 %.

Can dissolved oxygen be zero?
-----------------------------

Dissolved Oxygen in a stream may vary from 0 mg/l to 18 mg/l. Readings above 18 mg/l are physically impossible.

Why is there more dissolved oxygen in stagnant water?
-----------------------------------------------------

Rapidly moving water, such as in a mountain stream or large river, tends to contain a lot of dissolved oxygen, whereas stagnant water contains less. Bacteria in water can consume oxygen as organic matter decays. Thus, excess organic material in lakes and rivers can cause eutrophic conditions, which is an oxygen-deficient situation …

Where does dissolved oxygen in a stream come from?
--------------------------------------------------

Oxygen enters a stream mainly from the atmosphere and, in areas where groundwater discharge into streams is a large portion of streamflow, from groundwater discharge. This dissolved oxygen is breathed by fish and zooplankton and is needed by them to survive.

When does dissolved oxygen decrease in the Gulf of Mexico?
----------------------------------------------------------

The oxygen depletion begins in late spring, increases in summer, and ends in the fall. Dissolved oxygen in bottom waters, measured from June 8 through July 17, 2009, during the annual summer Gulf of Mexico Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) cruise in the northern Gulf of Mexico.

Why does cold water have more dissolved oxygen?
-----------------------------------------------

 Cold water can hold more dissolved oxygen than warm water. In winter and early spring, when the water temperature is low, the dissolved oxygen concentration is high. In summer and fall, when the water temperature is high, the dissolved-oxygen concentration is often lower.
