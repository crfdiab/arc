What is the relationship between earthquakes and floods?
--------------------------------------------------------

Why is Japan prone to floods?
-----------------------------

Part 1: Large-scale floods in Japan The country is exposed to a series of natural hazards – geo-seismic (earthquakes and volcanic activity, with the subsequent risk of tsunamis), as well as hydro-meteorological events – typhoons occur frequently in September and October.

How did the earthquake and tsunami in Japan happen?
---------------------------------------------------

Japan’s Earthquake and Tsunami: How They Happened. The 8.9-magnitude earthquake that struck coastal Japan on Friday, devastating large swaths of the coast and spawning a powerful tsunami, was caused by the Pacific tectonic plate thrusting underneath the country, and forcing the seabed and ocean water upward.

How did the Great Kanto earthquake affect Japan?
------------------------------------------------

If earthquakes occur below or close to the ocean, they may trigger tidal waves (tsunami). Many parts of the country have experienced devastating earthquakes and tidal waves in the past. The Great Kanto Earthquake, the worst in Japanese history, hit the Kanto plain around Tokyo in 1923 and resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 people.

What was the magnitude of the earthquake in Japan?
--------------------------------------------------

The most powerful earthquake recorded in Japanese history, magnitude 8.9. The tremors were the result of a violent uplift of the sea floor 80 miles off the coast of Sendai, where the Pacific tectonic plate slides beneath the plate Japan sits on. Tens of miles of crust ruptured along the trench where the tectonic plates meet.
