What if Britain never Colonised Australia?
------------------------------------------

If no one colonised it, there would probably hundreds of aboriginal kingdoms. Australia would not be a country, instead there would be many aboriginal nations on the continent, maybe due to european influence they would have federated to make a unified continent.

What would have happened if there was no colonization?
------------------------------------------------------

If Europeans never colonized and invaded America, the native nations and tribes would continue to interact in trade. Eventually, trade with East Asia and Europe would introduce new technologies and animals into the continent and tribes would quickly grow into nations.

Who else would have Colonised Australia?
----------------------------------------

If the British hadn’t colonised the continent in the late 18th century some other country most certainly would have – probably the French or the Dutch….As things were at the end of the 18th century, the probable contenders would have been:

- France;
- Netherlands; and/or.
- Spain. Where is Australia without colonisation?
    ----------------------------------------
    
    Without colonisation, modern technology still would have found its way to our shores just like it has in countries such as Fiji, Solomon Islands &amp; Papua New Guinea etc. Industrialisation &amp; mining however would be nowhere near the levels that we see today and we would be better off for it.
    
    Who Colonised Australia first?
    ------------------------------
    
    British  
    On January 26, 1788, Captain Arthur Phillip guides a fleet of 11 British ships carrying convicts to the colony of New South Wales, effectively founding Australia.
    
    What if New Zealand was never colonized?
    ----------------------------------------
    
    If New Zealand were never colonised, it would be uninhabited. The Maoris arrived from Polynesia in the 14th century and settled mainly in the North Island, and the British arrived in the early 19th century. Unlike Australia, New Zealand has no indigenous population dating from prehistory.
    
    Are there any full blooded Māori left in NZ?
    --------------------------------------------
    
    Being Māori is so much more than blood quantum. In New Zealand, many believed there are no full-blood Māori left. It’s often been used by critics of Māori who seek equal rights and sovereignty. My results, at least, show there is one full-blooded Māori contrary to that belief.
    
    Why did the British want to colonize Australia?
    -----------------------------------------------
    
    The thing with Australia is its geography doesn’t allow easy access from the north. The British colonized Australia once they found more habitable land in the south eastern part of Australia, and spread from that point to the north and west. Even today, most population of Australia is concentrated on the south-east part of the continent.
    
    What would have happened if the British had never claimed Australia?
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    So if the British had never claimed Australia, the French would almost certainly have grabbed the east coast and a few different countries might have fought it out over the west and the north. There were certainly plenty of contenders. 25 insanely cool gadgets selling out quickly in 2021.
    
    What would have happened if the Dutch had not colonized Australia?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The Dutch were the first Europeans to land there, and a total of 30 different Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts; they named it “New Holland.” If the British had not colonized the continent, someone else would have, probably the Dutch. It is unlikely that it would have been left alone entirely.
    
    Why did the people of Indonesia not colonize Australia?
    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    Javaneser or Makassar or Bugis or Timorese search fish or unique commodity. Also dry weather in Australia made they didn’t like it. Also behavior of our peoples not colonize and settle in nowhere land . They more like stay in crowded place in port such Surabaya, Makassar, or Banten. Sam… Loading… Our ancestor probably know Australia .
