What is the process of terrace formation?
-----------------------------------------

They are formed by the downcutting of a river or stream channel into and the abandonment and lateral erosion of its former floodplain.

What causes alluvial terraces to form?
--------------------------------------

Alluvial terraces form when land slowly rises by pressure from tectonic forces. Each time the land is raised, a new floodplain forms. A succession of these events can produce step-like terrain, such as these stream terraces in New Zealand.

What is a terrace building?
---------------------------

A terrace is an external, raised, open, flat area in either a landscape (such as a park or garden) near a building, or as a roof terrace on a flat roof.

What is Delta formation?
------------------------

Deltas are wetlands that form as rivers empty their water and sediment into another body of water. The Nile delta, created as it empties into the Mediterranean Sea, has a classic delta formation. Although very uncommon, deltas can also empty into land. A river moves more slowly as it nears its mouth, or end.

Why is it called terrace house?
-------------------------------

The term terrace was borrowed from garden terraces by British architects of the late Georgian period to describe streets of houses whose uniform fronts and uniform height created an ensemble that was more stylish than a “row”.

What is the terrace used for?
-----------------------------

Terraces are earthen structures that intercept runoff on moderate to steep slopes. They transform long slopes into a series of shorter slopes. Terraces reduce the rate of runoff and allow soil particles to settle out. The resulting cleaner water is then carried off the field in a non-erosive manner.

What is the difference between a Strath terrace and a depositional terrace?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both features are shown in cross-sectional cartoon view. Terraces are cut into alluvium, the unconsolidated sediment deposited by the same river which is now incising. Straths, on the other hand, have the same shape but are etched into bedrock.

How are cut terraces formed in a river?
---------------------------------------

Cut terraces are formed after constant changes in water flow in the river, causing erosion of the river valley. The eroded sediment exposes cut terraces. On the flipside are nested fill terraces which are formed after the eroded alluvium is deposited in a valley, but increased water flow erodes away the deposited sediment.

What is the definition of a terrace in geology?
-----------------------------------------------

Terrace (geology) A terrace consists of a flat or gently sloping geomorphic surface, called a tread, that is typically bounded one side by a steeper ascending slope, which is called a “riser” or “scarp.”. The tread and the steeper descending slope (riser or scarp) together constitute the terrace.

What kind of sediments make up a terrace?
-----------------------------------------

The sediments underlying the tread and riser of a terrace are also commonly, but incorrectly, called terraces, leading to confusion. Terraces are formed in various ways. Fluvial terraces are remnants of the former floodplain of a stream or river.

What causes the formation of a structural terrace?
--------------------------------------------------

In geomorphology, a structural terrace is a terrace created by the differential erosion of flat-lying or nearly flat-lying layered strata. The terrace results from preferential stripping by erosion of a layer of softer strata from an underlying layer of harder strata.
