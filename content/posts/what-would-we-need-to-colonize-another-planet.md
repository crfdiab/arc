What would we need to colonize another planet?
----------------------------------------------

Method. Building colonies in space would require access to water, food, space, people, construction materials, energy, transportation, communications, life support, simulated gravity, radiation protection and capital investment. It is likely the colonies would be located near the necessary physical resources.

Can humans live Venus?
----------------------

To date, no definitive proof has been found of past or present life on Venus. With extreme surface temperatures reaching nearly 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F) and an atmospheric pressure 90 times that of Earth, the conditions on Venus make water-based life as we know it unlikely on the surface of the planet.

Are there any plans to colonize Venus?
--------------------------------------

More recently, NASA scientist Geoffrey A. Landis wrote a paper titled “ Colonization of Venus “, in which he proposed that cities could be built above Venus’ clouds. At an altitude of 50 km above the surface, he claimed, such cities would be safe from the harsh Venusian environment:

How big of a balloon do you need to colonize Venus?
---------------------------------------------------

Because Venus’ atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide, a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen—the regular air you’re breathing now—could easily generate the necessary lift. “A one-kilometer diameter spherical \[balloon\] will lift 700,000 tons—two Empire State Buildings.

Why do we need air in the atmosphere of Venus?
----------------------------------------------

We’d need air to breathe and protection from the sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. In looking at Venus, the fact that struck Landis the most is that Earth’s atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen would actually float in Venus’ atmosphere of carbon dioxide.

Is it possible to make permanent settlements on Venus?
------------------------------------------------------

It is proposed here. that in the near term, human exploration of Venus could take place from aerostat vehicles in the atmosphere, and that in the long term, permanent settlements could be made in the form of cities designed to float at about fifty kilometer altitude in the atmosphere of Venus.
