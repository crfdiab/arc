What is the process of evaporation from leaves?
-----------------------------------------------

Transpiration is the evaporation of water from the surface of leaf cells in actively growing plants. This water is replaced by additional absorption of water from the soil leading to a continuous column of water in the plant’s xylem.

What is transpiration botany?
-----------------------------

Transpiration, in botany, a plant’s loss of water, mainly through the stomates of leaves. Modern research has shown that as much as 99 percent of the water taken in by the roots of a plant is released into the air as water vapour.

What is evaporation transpiration?
----------------------------------

Water is removed from the surface of the Earth to the atmosphere by two distinct mechanisms: evaporation and transpiration. Evaporation can be defined as the process where liquid water is transformed into a gaseous state. Transpiration is the process of water loss from plants through stomata.

What comes first transpiration or evaporation?
----------------------------------------------

Transpiration is just a subset of the evaporation process, and it’s the water that is inside plants, and then when that evaporates and moves into the atmosphere, that process is called transpiration. And it’s very much part of the living processes of the plant.

What are the three types of transpiration?
------------------------------------------

The three major types of transpiration are: (1) Stomatal Transpiration (2) Lenticular Transpiration and (3) Cuticular Transpiration.

What is difference between transpiration and evaporation?
---------------------------------------------------------

In both the process, water is evaporated from the surface to the atmosphere in the form of a gaseous water vapour….Difference between Transpiration and Evaporation.

<table><tr><th>Transpiration</th><th>Evaporation</th></tr><tr><td>Transpiration makes the surface of leaves and young stems wet and protects them from sunburn.</td><td>Evaporation provides dryness to the free surface.</td></tr></table>

Where does evaporation and transpiration take place in plants?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Evaporation and transpiration. Dave Campbell explains that evaporation occurs when water changes from a liquid state to a gaseous state. It can happen anywhere there is water – in the soil, lakes, oceans and plants. When it occurs in plants, water is lost through microscopic pores in the plant’s leaves (stomata).

Dave Campbell explains that evaporation occurs when water changes from a liquid state to a gaseous state. It can happen anywhere there is water – in the soil, lakes, oceans and plants. When it occurs in plants, water is lost through microscopic pores in the plant’s leaves ( stomata ). This process is called transpiration.

When do plants release water what happens to the leaves?
--------------------------------------------------------

When this process is described along with evaporation – what happens on the leaves – it’s called evapotranspiration. Plants can also release water when injured, but that’s a different process. Evapotranspiration rates change depending on environmental factors such as weather, humidity, or soil type.

Which is the opposite of the process of evaporation?
----------------------------------------------------

As on a hot, dry day, the temperature is high and humidity is low, the evaporation rate is higher. The water takes energy from the air and gets converted to vapour. This makes the air cooler. This is the opposite of evaporation: a gas turns into a liquid and heat energy is lost in this process.
