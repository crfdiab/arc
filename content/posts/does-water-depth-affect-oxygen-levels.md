Does water depth affect oxygen levels?
--------------------------------------

Oxygen in lakes changes with depth. In deep lakes that do not get very much wind, oxygen levels go down as we get deeper. In all lakes, oxygen is generally low right at the bottom where water meets the lake sediment or mud. This is because there are many bacteria and animals that live and breathe in the sediment.

Does oxygen change with depth?
------------------------------

As depth increases, dissolved oxygen declines, reaching a minimum between a few hundred meters and 1000 m deep, the aptly-named oxygen minimum layer .

Does deeper water have more oxygen?
-----------------------------------

Deep ocean waters hold far less oxygen than surface waters because they haven’t been in contact with air for centuries. And in many places, decomposing organic matter raining down from the surface uses up what little oxygen remains. Oxygen levels normally vary with depth.

Are oxygen levels higher near the ocean?
----------------------------------------

Extensive measurements have shown that the highest oxygen concentrations are found at high latitudes, where the ocean is cold, especially well-mixed and ventilated.

What should dissolved oxygen levels be in water?
------------------------------------------------

dissolved oxygen and higher %DO while warmer, polluted waters will have lower mg/L and %DO. Healthy water should generally have dissolved oxygen concentrations above 6.5-8 mg/L

Why does surface water have less oxygen than deeper water?
----------------------------------------------------------

This means that warmer surface water requires less dissolved oxygen to reach 100% air saturation than does deeper, cooler water. For example, at sea level (1 atm or 760 mmHg) and 4°C (39°F), 100% air-saturated water would hold 10.92 mg/L of dissolved oxygen.

Why is there more oxygen in the bottom of the ocean?
----------------------------------------------------

But there is another reason that bottom water contains more oxygen than mid-water depths that has to do with the way water circulates throughout the deep ocean (see section 9.8 ). In polar regions, the cold surface water absorbs lots of oxygen. This cold, oxygen-rich water sinks to the bottom due to its high , taking the oxygen with it.

How much dissolved oxygen does a fish need?
-------------------------------------------

Each type of fish living in the water requires a different amount of dissolved oxygen to live. For example, Northern Pike cannot survive in less than about 6 milligrams of dissolved oxygen per liter of water (6 mg/L). If dissolved oxygen levels decrease to about 3-4 mg/L, even the strongest fish may suffocate.
