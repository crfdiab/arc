What is IFR low?
----------------

IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts provide aeronautical information for navigation under instrument flight rules below 18,000 feet MSL . These four-color chart series includes: Air Traffic Services. Airports that have an Instrument Approach Procedure or a minimum 3000′ hard surface runway. Airways/Route Data.

How long are low enroute charts good for?
-----------------------------------------

Charts are revised every 56 days.

What is the difference between low altitude airways and high altitude airways?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Altitude Airways are generally for use above 18,000 (class A airspace) while Low Altitude Airways are used below 18,000. Since they are primarily for IFR use, the charts don’t provide much terrain detail unlike sectionals. Their primary purpose is to show the airway info.

What are IFR T routes?
----------------------

RNAV terminal transition routes, referred to as Tango or “T” routes, allow Global Positioning System (GPS) equipped, instrument flight rules (IFR) operations to efficiently fly around or through Class B and Class C airspace areas.

What is a DOD flip?
-------------------

Flight Information Publications and Flight Information Products (FLIP) are sensitive flight critical mapping and charting type items produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), foreign governments and commercial vendors that are distributed by Defense Distribution Mapping and varied civilian …

When should VOR frequencies be changed?
---------------------------------------

The numbers indicate the distance at which to change the VOR frequency. The frequency change might be required due to signal reception or conflicting frequencies. If a COP does not appear on an airway, the frequency should be changed midway between the facilities. A COP at an intersection may indicate a course change.

Can you fly IFR without VOR?
----------------------------

The federal aviation regulations, specifically 14 CFR 91

Do airplanes have routes?
-------------------------

There are paths in the sky called air routes. Planes fly along air routes. Because planes fly at very high speeds in the air, if they passed too closed to one another, this could be extremely dangerous. The airplane follows the orders of the airport and the air traffic controller in the control center.

Can you fly direct IFR?
-----------------------

Now, to address the specifics of the question. Yes, a pilot CAN fly IFR without a Flight Plan, but CANNOT fly IFR without an ATC Clearance.

What are FLIPs aviation?
------------------------

Flight Information Publications (FLIPs) or Flight Guides are produced by commercial organisations to meet the need to provide authoritative documentation in a convenient form for use in flight. One or more manuals listing general aeronautical information and information specific to the countries covered by the FLIP.

When to use IFR enroute high altitude charts?
---------------------------------------------

IFR Enroute High Altitude Charts (Conterminous U.S. and Alaska) are designed for navigation at or above 18,000 ft MSL. This four color series includes:

What are the different types of IFR routes?
-------------------------------------------

10 Types Of IFR Routes Published On Enroute Charts. 1 1) Victor Airways (Low Altitude) 2 2) LF/MF Airways (Alaska Only + 1 In North Carolina) 3 3) Jet Routes (High Altitude Victor Airways) 4 4) Low Altitude RNAV Routes (T-Routes) 5 5) High Altitude RNAV Routes (Q-Routes)

How are VOR changeover points depicted on IFR charts?
-----------------------------------------------------

VOR changeover points (COPs) are depicted on the charts by this symbol The numbers indicate the distance at which to change the VOR frequency The frequency change might be required due to signal reception or conflicting frequencies If a COP does not appear on an airway, the frequency should be changed midway between the facilities
