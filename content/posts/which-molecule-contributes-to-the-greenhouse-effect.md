Which molecule contributes to the greenhouse effect?
----------------------------------------------------

Carbon Dioxide Emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities. In 2019, CO2 accounted for about 80 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.

Is molecular nitrogen a greenhouse gas?
---------------------------------------

Oxygen and nitrogen are not greenhouse gases, because they are transparent to infrared light. These molecules are invisible because when you stretch one, it doesn’t change the electric field. In general, symmetrical molecules with only two atoms are not greenhouse gases.

What kind of compound is greenhouse?
------------------------------------

Greenhouse gases are compounds such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon monoxide, that trap longwave solar radiation (heat) in the earth’s lower atmosphere, keeping its surface warmer than it would be if the gases were in lower quantities.

How does a greenhouse affect the growth of plants?
--------------------------------------------------

A greenhouse is a house made of glass that can be used to grow plants. The sun’s radiations warm the plants and the air inside the greenhouse. The heat trapped inside can’t escape out and warms the greenhouse which is essential for the growth of the plants.

Which is the most important component of a greenhouse?
------------------------------------------------------

Composite less-reflective glass, or less effective but cheaper anti-reflective coated simple glass, also produced savings. Ventilation is one of the most important components in a successful greenhouse. If there is no proper ventilation, greenhouses and their growing plants can become prone to problems.

What’s the difference between a greenhouse and a hothouse?
----------------------------------------------------------

A miniature greenhouse is known as a cold frame. The interior of a greenhouse exposed to sunlight becomes significantly warmer than the external ambient temperature, protecting its contents in cold weather. Many commercial glass greenhouses or hothouses are high tech production facilities for vegetables or flowers.

How are temperature and humidity used in greenhouses?
-----------------------------------------------------

Different techniques are then used to evaluate optimality degrees and comfort ratio of greenhouses, such as air temperature, relative humidity and vapour-pressure deficit, in order to reduce production risk prior to cultivation of a specific crop.
