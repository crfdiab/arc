Who invented the 1st rocket?
----------------------------

Dr. Robert Hutchings Goddard

When was the first rocket designed?
-----------------------------------

1100 AD  
A: The first rocket was invented around 1100 AD in China. These rockets used solid propellants and were mainly used as weapons and fireworks. It was not until the 1920s that rocket societies emerged, and by the 1930s and 1940s professional rocket engineering took off.

When did Goddard die?
---------------------

August 10, 1945  
Robert H. Goddard/Date of death

Robert Goddard died of throat cancer in Baltimore, Maryland, on August 10, 1945. Goddard was 62 years old. He is credited with 214 patents, of which 131 were filed by his wife after his death.

It is difficult to say what is impossible, for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow. Colorized image of Dr. Goddard at a Clark University chalkboard in 1924. American rocketry pioneer Robert H. Goddard and his first liquid-fueled rocket, March 16, 1926.

Who was the first person to launch a rocket?
--------------------------------------------

On March 16, 1926, Robert Goddard successfully launched the first liquid-fueled rocket in Auburn, Mass.

Who was the inventor of the liquid fueled rocket?
-------------------------------------------------

Robert H. Goddard. Robert Hutchings Goddard (October 5, 1882 – August 10, 1945) was an American engineer, professor, physicist, and inventor who is credited with creating and building the world’s first liquid-fueled rocket. Goddard successfully launched his rocket on March 16, 1926, ushering in an era of space flight and innovation.

What kind of fuel did Robert Goddard use?
-----------------------------------------

He was the first to explore mathematically the ratios of energy and thrust per weight of various fuels, including liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. He was also the first to develop a rocket motor using liquid fuels (liquid oxygen and gasoline), as used in the German V-2 rocket weapon 15 years later.
