What was the reason for the French exploration?
-----------------------------------------------

The French began their exploration of the New World by looking for new fishing waters and the Northwest Passage. At first, they only founded temporary trading posts, but as profits increased and more French people found their way to the New World, permanent settlements were established, such as New Orleans.

What was the goal of the first French explorer?
-----------------------------------------------

Jacques Cartier’s First North American Voyage The purpose of the voyage was to find a northwest passage to Asia, as well as to collect riches such as gold and spices along the way. Did you know? In addition to his exploration of the St. Lawrence region, Jacques Cartier is credited with giving Canada its name.

What did the French explorers hope to find?
-------------------------------------------

They hoped to find the Northwest Passage, a direct sea route to Asia via the Pacific Ocean. The king commissioned Verrazano to chart (to make a map of) the entire Atlantic coast of North America, from modern-day Florida to Newfoundland (an island off the coast of Canada).

Who was the French explorer who explored Lake Michigan?
-------------------------------------------------------

Samuel de Champlain, the greatest of the French explorers, founded Port Royal (1605) and Québec (1608). Jean Nicolet (Nicollet), a companion of Champlain, explored Lake Michigan and surrounding areas in the 1630s. Louis Joliet and Jacques Marquette conducted explorations of the Mississippi Basin in 1673.

When did the French and Dutch explore the New World?
----------------------------------------------------

French and Dutch exploration in the New World. French, Dutch, and English explorers began to make inroads into the Americans in the late 1500s and early 1600s.

How did Jacques Cartier contribute to French exploration?
---------------------------------------------------------

After two more voyages in 1535 and 1541, France temporarily gave up on discovering a passage to Asia. At that time, French Protestants and Catholics were in a civil war, so there was no time or money for exploration. Jacques Cartier paved the way for French exploration of North America.
