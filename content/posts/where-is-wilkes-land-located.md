Where is Wilkes Land located?
-----------------------------

Antarctica  
Wilkes Land, region in Antarctica, bordering the Indian Ocean between Queen Mary and George V coasts (100°–142°20′ E). The region is almost entirely covered by the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), averaging from 6,000 to 9,500 feet (1,800 to 2,900 metres) above sea level.

What ocean is around Antarctica?
--------------------------------

The Southern Ocean  
The Southern Ocean encircles Antarctica, and its area is usually defined as extending from the edge of the continent (and its ice shelves) to the position of the ‘polar front’ separating it from the surrounding Pacific, Indian and South Atlantic Oceans.

Is New Zealand in the Southern Ocean?
-------------------------------------

Australian standpoint. In Australia, cartographical authorities define the Southern Ocean as including the entire body of water between Antarctica and the south coasts of Australia and New Zealand, and up to 60°S elsewhere.

Where is Southern Ocean located in world map?
---------------------------------------------

Southern Ocean, also called Antarctic Ocean, body of salt water covering approximately one-sixteenth of Earth’s total ocean area. The Southern Ocean is made up of the portions of the world ocean south of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans and their tributary seas surrounding Antarctica below 60° S.

Is there a crater under Antarctica?
-----------------------------------

Wilkes Land crater is an informal term that may apply to two separate cases of conjectured giant impact craters hidden beneath the ice cap of Wilkes Land, East Antarctica.

What keeps Lake Vostok from freezing?
-------------------------------------

Geothermal heat from the Earth keeps the temperature of the lake water hovering around 27 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 3 degrees Celsius), scientists believe. The weighty pressure of the overlying ice keeps the lake liquid despite its below-freezing temperature.

Where is Wilkes Land in the Indian Ocean?
-----------------------------------------

It fronts on the southern Indian Ocean between Queen Mary Coast and Adelie Land, extending from Cape Hordern in 100°31′ E to Pourquoi Pas Point, in 136°11′ E. The region extends as a sector about 2600 km towards the South Pole, with an estimated land area of 2,600,000 km², mostly glaciated.

What kind of land is Wilkes Land in Antarctica?
-----------------------------------------------

Wilkes Land is a large district of land in eastern Antarctica, formally claimed by Australia as part of the Australian Antarctic Territory, though the validity of this claim has been placed for the period of the operation of the Antarctic Treaty, to which Australia is a signatory.

Where did the name Wilkes Land come from?
-----------------------------------------

In a wider sense, Wilkes Land extends further East to Point Alden in 142°02′ E, thereby including Adélie Land, which is claimed by France. Wilkes Land is named after Lieutenant Charles Wilkes (later a rear admiral ), the American explorer who commanded the 1838–42 United States Exploring Expedition.

When did they find the Wilkes Land crater?
------------------------------------------

In 2006 a team of researchers led by Ralph von Frese and Laramie Potts used gravity measurements by NASA’s GRACE satellites to discover the 300-mile-wide Wilkes Land crater, which probably formed about 250 million years ago. Wilkes Land is featured prominently in the 1998 film The X-Files.
