Why did the British government continue to pass new taxes in the face of colonial opposition?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under huge pressure to curb spending, the British king and government believed that any further attempts to tax the homeland would fail. They thus seized upon other sources of income, one of which was taxing the American colonists in order to pay for the army protecting them.

Why did the British raise new taxes on colonists?
-------------------------------------------------

The British raised taxes on the American Colonies to help pay for the expense of the French and Indian Wars.

Why did colonists get upset with British taxes?
-----------------------------------------------

Colonists began getting extremely upset by all the taxes. Colonists wrecked the homes of a few British officials and beat up tax collectors. Because of this British soldiers were sent to “keep an eye on things” around the colonies.

Why was the colonists unhappy with the British?
-----------------------------------------------

Colonists who had already settled on these lands were ordered to return east of the mountains. In 1765 Parliament passed the Quartering Act that said the colonists needed to find or pay for lodging for British soldiers stationed in America. With the French and Indian War over, many colonists saw no need for soldiers to be stationed in the colonies.

Why did the colonists not like the Townsend Acts?
-------------------------------------------------

Other laws, such as the Townsend Acts, passed in 1767, required the colonists to pay taxes on imported goods like tea. Many colonists felt that they should not pay these taxes, because they were passed in England by Parliament, not by their own colonial governments. They protested, saying that these taxes violated their rights as British citizens.

Why was the tax important to the colonies?
------------------------------------------

The tax would be important, not just for the income, but also for the precedent it would set: Britain would start with a small tax, and maybe one day levy enough to pay for the colonies’ whole defense. The money raised was to be kept in the colonies and spent there.
