Will the ice caps ever melt?
----------------------------

The water from those liquefying ice sheets pours into the oceans, inching sea levels higher and higher. There’s little sign that the melting of the ice caps will slow any time soon. If anything, it’s going to get exponentially faster, scientists say.

What is causing ice caps to melt?
---------------------------------

Human activities are at the root of this phenomenon. Specifically, since the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have raised temperatures, even higher in the poles, and as a result, glaciers are rapidly melting, calving off into the sea and retreating on land.

What happens if all the ice caps melt?
--------------------------------------

Global warming is a pressing issue that affects everyone. Though it may be hard to tell right now while we still have polar ice caps, National Geographic recently created a series of maps that illustrate how visually different the Earth would look if all the ice on the planet melted.

How are cities affected by ice sheet melt?
------------------------------------------

A forecasting tool reveals which cities will be affected as different portions of the ice sheet melt, say scientists. It looks at the Earth’s spin and gravitational effects to predict how water will be “redistributed” globally.

What would the earth look like if all the ice melted?
-----------------------------------------------------

Though it may be hard to tell right now while we still have polar ice caps, National Geographic recently created a series of maps that illustrate how visually different the Earth would look if all the ice on the planet melted. The maps reveal a world with far fewer land masses that are above sea level.

When is the Arctic ice going to melt?
-------------------------------------

Arctic polar ice in summer is almost gone already. Current models say it won’t last more than the next four years. So by the most narrow definition of polar ice melting, it’s about to happen. There will still be Arctic ice during the winter until about 2040 or 2050 by current estimates, and for a decade or…
