How can we prevent damage from tornadoes?
-----------------------------------------

Tornado mitigation strategies

1. Meet building codes.
2. Install good windows.
3. Strengthen entry doors.
4. Install impact-resistant patio doors.
5. Install strong garage doors.
6. Stiffen double-wide doors.
7. Properly repair roofing.
8. Make an inventory of your possessions.

How do people survive tornadoes on the road?
--------------------------------------------

If you cannot reach shelter:

1. Get off the road as soon as possible. It is often better to leave the road completely than to pull over to the side.
2. Avoid stopping under bridges and tunnels.
3. Get off the road as soon as possible.
4. Stay covered.

How do tornadoes impact the health of the natural system?
---------------------------------------------------------

Tornadoes effect the environment by destroying buildings and trees. Tornadoes also kill animals, which effects the food chain and disrupts the whole environment. Fires may occur after a tornado due to damaged power lines and gas leaks. Fire contributes to global warming by giving off carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Is it important to know how to protect yourself from tornadoes?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Although some areas are more prone to experience tornados, they have appeared in every state. Yes, even Alaska. That’s why it’s important that you know how to protect yourself from a tornado. It’s one of those things that nobody really tells you, but everyone should know. Good tornado safety could mean the difference between life and death.

Where to go in case of a tornado?
---------------------------------

Go to the basement or an inside room without windows on the lowest floor (bathroom, closet, center hallway). If possible, avoid sheltering in a room with windows. For added protection get under something sturdy (a heavy table or workbench).

What do you need to prepare for a tornado?
------------------------------------------

Prepare for tornadoes by gathering—ahead of time—emergency supplies, including food, water, medications, batteries, flashlights, important documents, road maps, and a full tank of gasoline. When a tornado approaches, anyone in its path should take shelter indoors—preferably in a basement or an interior first-floor room or hallway.

What should you wear in the aftermath of a tornado?
---------------------------------------------------

Wear sturdy shoes or boots, long sleeves, and gloves when handling or walking on or near debris. Be aware of hazards from exposed nails and broken glass.
