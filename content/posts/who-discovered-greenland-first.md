There has been no evidence discovered that Greenland was known to Europeans until the 10th century, when Icelandic Vikings settled on its southwestern coast, which seems to have been uninhabited when they arrived. Although Greenland is still a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, it has enjoyed home rule since 1979.

Why did the Vikings disappear from Greenland?

Environmental data show that Greenland’s climate worsened during the Norse colonization. In response, the Norse turned from their struggling farms to the sea for food before finally abandoning their settlements. 983 Erik the Red explores and possibly names Greenland.

Who named Greenland Iceland?
----------------------------

“In the summer, Erik left to settle in the country he had found, which he called Greenland, as he said people would be attracted there if it had a favorable name.” Thus, Iceland was named by a sad Viking and Greenland is the slogan of a medieval marketing scheme.

When was the island of Greenland first discovered?
--------------------------------------------------

Greenland, on the other hand, was discovered in 982 A.D., when Erik the Red, the father of Leif Eriksson, landed on the southeastern part of the island.

When did Erik the Red give Greenland its name?
----------------------------------------------

Erik the Red gave Greenland its name over 1,000 years ago and ushered in the country’s Viking era.

Who was the most recent person to settle in Greenland?
------------------------------------------------------

The most recent arrival was the Thule culture ( c. 1100), from which the Inugsuk culture developed during the 12th and 13th centuries. In 982 the Norwegian Erik the Red, who had been banished from Iceland for manslaughter, settled on the island today known as Greenland.
