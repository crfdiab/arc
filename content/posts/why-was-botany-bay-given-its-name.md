Why was Botany Bay given its name?
----------------------------------

The bay was the site in 1770 of Captain James Cook’s first landing in Australia. He named it Stingray Harbour but later changed the name because of the variety of new plants found there by his expedition’s naturalist, Joseph (later Sir Joseph) Banks.

What does HMS Endeavour stand for?
----------------------------------

His Majesty’s Bark the Endeavour  
The refitted vessel was commissioned as His Majesty’s Bark the Endeavour, to distinguish her from the 4-gun cutter HMS Endeavour. On 21 July 1768, Endeavour sailed to Gallion’s Reach to take on armaments to protect her against potentially hostile Pacific island natives.

What was Botany Bay first called?
---------------------------------

Stingray Bay  
Botany Bay, discovered on 29 April 1770 by Captain Cook, who first named it Stingray Bay, later Botanists’ (Harbour and Bay), and finally Botany Bay in his journal, probably to honour the botanists aboard HMS Endeavour led by Sir Joseph Banks as well as to mark its floral novelties.

Why was the ship Endeavour anchored in Botany Bay?
--------------------------------------------------

Even so, Cook evidently found a valuable port while Endeavour was anchored in Botany Bay in 1770 because, after leaving the Bay, the ship did not enter and investigate any other inlet on the temperate coast of Australia.

Why was Botany Bay named after Captain Cook?
--------------------------------------------

Captain Cook’s landing is generally considered the beginning of England’s exploration and eventual colonization of Australia. The name Botany Bay was given to the bay in reference to the abundance of plant life (as in botany, the scientific study of plants) that was discovered by Cook’s crew.

Who was the first person to land in Botany Bay?
-----------------------------------------------

The land adjacent to Botany Bay was settled for many thousands of years by the Tharawal and Eora Aboriginal peoples and their associated clans. On 29 April 1770, Botany Bay was the site of James Cook ‘s first landing of HMS Endeavour on the land mass of Australia, after his extensive navigation of New Zealand.

Where did James Cook land in Botany Bay?
----------------------------------------

Near the bay are the facilities for the Kingsford Smith International Airport. Botany Bay National Park and the Towra Point Nature Reserve are also located at Botany Bay. In 1770, the inlet (which was initially called Stingray Bay) was the landing site of British explorer and navigator James Cook (1728–1779) and his ship, the HMS Endeavour.
