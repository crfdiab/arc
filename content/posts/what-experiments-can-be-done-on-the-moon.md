What experiments can be done on the Moon?
-----------------------------------------

Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP)

- Heat Flow Experiment.
- Ejecta and Meteorites Experiment.
- Seismic Profiling Experiment.
- Atmospheric Composition Experiment.
- Surface Gravimeter. What were the samples from the Moon?
    ------------------------------------
    
    Apollo 11 carried the first geologic samples from the Moon back to Earth. In all, astronauts collected 22 kilograms of material, including 50 rocks, samples of the fine-grained lunar “soil,” and two core tubes that included material from up to 13 centimeters below the Moon’s surface.
    
    Do we have samples from the Moon?
    ---------------------------------
    
    The Genesis Rock, returned by the Apollo 15 lunar mission in 1971. Apollo astronauts work on the Moon to collect samples and explore. Near Shorty Crater they found some orange lunar regolith….Crewed missions.

    What was done on the Moon?
    --------------------------
    
    Lunar Landing Mission Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the Moon. The first steps by humans on another planetary body were taken by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on July 20, 1969. The astronauts also returned to Earth the first samples from another planetary body.
    
    Which is the first experiment done on the Moon?
    -----------------------------------------------
    
    Apollo 11 Seismic Experiment  
    The Passive Seismic Experiment was the first seismometer placed on the Moon’s surface. It detected lunar “moonquakes” and provided information about the internal structure of the Moon. Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin with the seismic experiment.
    
    How much is a moon rock?
    ------------------------
    
    NASA assessed the value of the rocks at around $50,800 per gram in 1973 dollars, based on the total cost of retrieving the samples. That works to just a hair over $300,000 a gram in today’s currency.
    
    How many seismometers are on the Moon?
    --------------------------------------
    
    four seismometers  
    The findings come from data collected by four seismometers deployed on the moon by NASA astronauts between 1969 and 1972 during the space agency’s six manned Apollo lunar landings. The seismometers kept working until 1977.
    
    What kind of Science is done on the Moon?
    -----------------------------------------
    
    Today, we study the Moon using telescopes and spacecraft. For example, NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been circling the Moon and sending back measurements since 2009. The Moon is the only other planetary body that humans have visited.
    
    Are there any artificial objects on the Moon?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    This is a partial list of artificial materials left on the Moon during the missions of the Apollo program.
    
    What did the astronauts do on the Moon?
    ---------------------------------------
    
    They collected hundreds of pounds of lunar soil and rock samples, conducted experiments and installed equipment for follow-up measurements. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin set up several scientific experiments while on the surface of the Moon during the historic Apollo 11 mission. You can see the lunar module, “Eagle,” in the background.

    Which is the heaviest object on the Moon?
    -----------------------------------------
    
    The remains of five S-IVB third stages of Saturn V rockets from the Apollo program are the heaviest single pieces sent to the Lunar surface. Humans have left over 187,400 kilograms (413,100 lb) of material on the Moon, and 380 kilograms (838 lb) of Moon rock was brought back to Earth by Apollo and Luna missions.
