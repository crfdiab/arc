What is the warmest ocean?
--------------------------

the Pacific Ocean  
The waters of the Pacific Ocean comprise the world’s largest heat reservoir, by far, and it is the warmest ocean, overall, of the world’s five oceans. (The other oceans are the Arctic, Antarctic and Indian Oceans.)

What kind of ocean does the equator pass through?
-------------------------------------------------

Answer and Explanation: The equator passes through the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. The only oceans it does not pass through are the Arctic Ocean… See full answer below.

Which is the only great circle that passes through the equator?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean. The equator is the only line of latitude which is also a great circle—that is, one whose plane passes through the centre of the globe. The Earth is widest at its Equator.

Are there any oceans that do not cross the equator?
---------------------------------------------------

The equator does not pass through the Arctic Ocean and Southern Ocean, or Antarctic Ocean. The Arctic Ocean is located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere, while the Southern Ocean is in the Southern Hemisphere. Earth’s waters are divided into five major oceans: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern and Arctic.

Is the equator in the northern or Southern Hemisphere?
------------------------------------------------------

The equator is an imaginary line that divides the earth into a Northern Hemisphere and a Southern Hemisphere. Generally speaking, lands that lie near the equator have very warm climates. The equator passes through the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. The only oceans it does not pass through are the Arctic Ocean…

Indian Ocean. The waters of the Indian Ocean have temperatures ranging between 72 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit on the upper layer of the ocean. The ocean also has no Arctic contact which ensures the ocean remains relatively warm all year round. The warm waters provide optimal conditions for phytoplankton growth which helps foster…

Is the Indian Ocean the coldest ocean on Earth?
-----------------------------------------------

Water temperatures of the Indian Ocean range between 66 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit (19 to 30 Celsius) on the ocean’s upper layer. Since it does not connect to the Arctic Ocean, the coldest ocean on Earth, the Indian Ocean stays pretty warm all year round.

Why is the Atlantic Ocean cooler than the Pacific Ocean?
--------------------------------------------------------

The Atlantic Ocean takes up about 20% of the Earth’s surface and 29% of the planet’s water. This ocean’s cooler temperatures compared to the Pacific are due to more contact with Arctic waters, and less water volume at the Equator. This ocean’s surface temperatures range from about 28 degrees Fahrenheit to above 84 (-2 to 29).

Which is colder the Southern Ocean or the Antarctic Ocean?
----------------------------------------------------------

The Southern Ocean’s Antarctic waters are extremely cold, while its sub-Antarctic waters are slightly warmer. It has surface temperatures ranging from 28 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit (-2 to 10 degrees Celsius). Size: about 7,849,000 square miles. Depth: between 13,000 and 16,000 feet. The deepest point is the South Sandwich Trench at 23,740 feet.

What was the warmest period in Earth history?
---------------------------------------------

Another stretch of Earth history that scientists count among the planet’s warmest occurred about 55-56 million years ago. The episode is known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Stretching from about 66-34 million years ago, the Paleocene and Eocene were the first geologic epochs following the end of the Mesozoic Era.

What’s the hottest the Earth has ever been?
-------------------------------------------

Even after collisions stopped, and the planet had tens of millions of years to cool, surface temperatures were likely more than 400° Fahrenheit. Zircon crystals from Australia, only about 150 million years younger than the Earth itself, hint that our planet may have cooled faster than scientists previously thought.
