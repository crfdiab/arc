How much water has Lake Mead lost since 2000?
---------------------------------------------

140 feet  
In 1983, the lake reached its highest recorded water level at 1,225 feet. Since 2000, the water level has dropped 140 feet, Reuters reports. The previous record its low water level was 1,071.6 feet in 2016.

How much has Lake Mead dropped?
-------------------------------

In 2000, Lake Mead was nearly full and its surface was lapping at the spillway gates of the Hoover Dam. Since then, the reservoir has fallen nearly 143 feet. And it’s now at the lowest levels since 1937.

How much water has Lake Powell lost?
------------------------------------

about 16 million acre-feet  
Since then, Lake Powell — straddling the Utah-Arizona border — has lost about 16 million acre-feet and is just 33% full.

When did Lake Mead start losing water?
--------------------------------------

The lake has remained below full capacity since 1983 due to drought and increased water demand. As of 30 June 2021, Lake Mead held 35.17% of full capacity at 9.102 million acre-feet (1.1227×1013 L), dropping below the reservoir’s previous all-time low of 9.328 million acre-feet (1.1506×1013 L) recorded in July 2016.

Will Lake Powell ever be full again?
------------------------------------

Based on the current forecast of 3.23 maf unregulated inflow, the July 24-Month Study projects Lake Powell elevation will end water year 2021 near 3,542.32 feet with approximately 7.05 maf in storage (29% of capacity).

Is Lake Powell full of water?
-----------------------------

In August 2020 Lake Powell was at an elevation of 3,599.72 feet (1,097.19 m) which is 100 feet (30 m) from full pool, and is 48% of full capacity, storing 11.72 million acre-feet (14.336 million megaliters) of water.

When did the water level in Lake Mead go down?
----------------------------------------------

Lake Mead’s water level rebounded a few feet by October 2015 and avoided triggering the drought restrictions. However, the water level starting falling in Spring 2016 and fell below the drought trigger level of 1,075 feet again in May 2016. It fell to a new record low of 1,071.61 feet (326.63 m) on July 1,…

What was the lake level in August 2010?
---------------------------------------

Another measure of the lake’s health is the lake level, or water elevation, which stood at 1,087 feet (331 meters) above sea level in late August 2010. Regional water management plans call for water restrictions to kick in when lake levels drop to 1,075 feet (328 meters). In August 1985, the lake level was 1,213 feet (370 meters).

How does melting snow affect the level of Lake Mead?
----------------------------------------------------

Melting snow raises the lake in the spring, while evaporation and siphoning of irrigation water lowers the level in summer. Since 2000, meltwater has raised the lake’s surface only one or two feet each spring, while summer water use has lowerd the level about 20 feet each year.

Why is the Lake Urmia in Iran disappearing?
-------------------------------------------

Lake Urmia: how Iran’s most famous lake is disappearing. Once one of the world’s largest lakes, the Aral Sea faded away due to diversion of water for agriculture from its tributaries, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers. The Aral Sea became a hallmark of poor agricultural water management in the Soviet era.
