Does temperature change cause earthquakes?
------------------------------------------

In fact, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, the only correlation that’s been noted between earthquakes and weather is that large changes in atmospheric pressure caused by major storms like hurricanes have been shown to occasionally trigger what are known as “slow earthquakes,” which release energy over …

Why does it rain after an earthquake?

How does an earthquake affect the weather on Earth?
---------------------------------------------------

The earthquake itself will not impact weather, but if you trace the earth quake back to original causes, such as continental drift, plate boundaries and breeches in the earth’s crust, especially deep in the oceans, where the crust is thinner, the result can be mantle heat being released into the oceans.

How does an earthquake in one place change the Earth?
-----------------------------------------------------
