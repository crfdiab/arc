What causes the Moon to get bigger?
-----------------------------------

This happens because the Moon’s light travels a longer distance through the atmosphere. As it travels a longer path, more of the shorter, bluer wavelengths of light are scattered away, leaving more of the longer, redder wavelengths.

How can a full moon change size?
--------------------------------

While a full moon can vary in apparent size from one cycle to the next (because the moon’s orbit around the Earth is slightly elliptical, bringing it nearer and farther from us), a given night’s moon takes up about same proportion of the sky wherever it is.

What determines Moon size?
--------------------------

The moon always occupies roughly 0.52 angular degrees on the sky, or about the size of a thumb tip held at arm’s length. That changes by a minuscule amount between lunar cycles, with the moon’s apparent size getting up to 14 percent larger than normal during its closest approach to Earth.

What is it called when the Moon get bigger?
-------------------------------------------

The Moon illusion is an optical illusion which causes the Moon to appear larger near the horizon than it does higher up in the sky. It has been known since ancient times and recorded by various cultures.

Where does moon appear largest?
-------------------------------

The Moon looks largest at any given instant of time when it is at an observer’s zenith —straight up. This can only occur in latitudes lower than 28.63 degrees, approximately. The increase in size is less than 2%.

What is causing the moon to appear to get bigger and smaller?
-------------------------------------------------------------

“When the moon is near the horizon, the ground and horizon make the moon appear relatively close. Because the moon is changing its apparent position in depth while the light stimulus remains constant, the brain’s size-distance mechanism changes its perceived size and makes the moon appear very large.

What makes a full moon appear bigger than a new moon?
-----------------------------------------------------

When the Moon, the Earth and the Sun are all lined up together with the Earth between the Moon and Sun, sunlight shines on the whole lunar surface and is reflected back to Earth. On Earth, this is known as a full Moon. When the Moon is between Earth and the Sun, no sunlight can reflect off its surface, and this is a new Moon.

Why does the Harvest Moon look so big?
--------------------------------------

This is why the full moon at this time of the year is referred to as the harvest moon. Why does the harvest moon look so big? The full moon will always look bigger when it’s near the horizon, but it’s not actually bigger. It’s totally an optical illusion. You can test this by just holding an Aspirin at arm’s length.

Why does the full moon look bigger at perigee?
----------------------------------------------

So if the full moon occurs at or near perigee, it appears noticeably larger in the sky than if it occurs at apogee, and it also it is brighter, because the amount of light received by the Earth from the Moon depends not only upon the amount of light the Moon gives off, but also how far the Earth is from the Moon.

Why are the tides higher during a full moon?
--------------------------------------------

That’s why tides around the equator are higher during both a new moon and a full moon ( spring tide ). The Sun also affects the Earth’s tides. However, tidal forces due to the Sun are about half as strong as those due to the Moon.
