Can I put wood in recycle bin?
------------------------------

Why can’t I put wood into the recycling bin? Wood contaminates the recycling stream which is meant to be clean, residue-free, and only made up of items for recycling curbside (paper, plastics, glass, etc.). Wood can be reused or recycled into woodchips/mulch when brought to a proper facility.

How do you dispose of wood?
---------------------------
