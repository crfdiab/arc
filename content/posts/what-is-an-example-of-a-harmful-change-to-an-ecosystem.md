What is an example of a harmful change to an ecosystem?
-------------------------------------------------------

The most common way that humans damage ecosystems is by destroying habitat. For example, we remove trees, change the flow of water, and change grasslands into farms. These practices can lead to local extinctions of species and cause other species to migrate to new areas.

How are ecosystems in danger?
-----------------------------

The water and ecosystems of the area are threatened by erosion, harmful blue-green algae blooms, invasive species, and salinity—all of which are exacerbated by climate change.

How does an environmental change affect an organism?
----------------------------------------------------

Environmental Changes. An environmental change is the alteration of the ecosystem in which an organism lives. The changes can take place gradually, like the formation of a desert over thousands of years. In this case, the local organisms have a great deal of time to adapt to their changing world.

Where are most of the changes in the ecosystem taking place?
------------------------------------------------------------

Changes have been especially rapid in the last 50 years and today the fastest changes are taking place in developing countries. Ecosystems are particularly affected by large-scale fishing, freshwater use, and agriculture.

How is human well-being affected by ecosystem change?
-----------------------------------------------------

3.1 Human well-being depends on material welfare, health, good social relations, security, and freedom. All of these are affected by changes in ecosystem services. More… 3.2 Ecosystem services, particularly food production, timber and fisheries, are important for employment and economic activity.

How are human interventions leading to ecosystem change?
--------------------------------------------------------

Human interventions have led to changes in the regulation of climate, disease, and other ecosystem processes. The use of ecosystems for recreation, spiritual enrichment, and other cultural purposes is growing. However, the capacity of ecosystems to provide these services has declined significantly. More…
