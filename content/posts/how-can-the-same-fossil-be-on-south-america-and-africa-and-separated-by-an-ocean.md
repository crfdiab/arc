How can the same fossil be on South America and Africa and separated by an ocean?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The only way these fossils can be found on continents that are separated by oceans is if the continents were once together (connected). Therefore, these creatures must have lived on a giant continent that later broke apart, and the pieces drifted away from each other.

How do plant fossils support continental drift?
-----------------------------------------------

Figure 6.6: Wegener used fossil evidence to support his continental drift hypothesis. The fossils of these organisms are found on lands that are now far apart. Wegener suggested that when the organisms were alive, the lands were joined and the organisms were living side-by-side.

How does South America and Africa support continental drift?
------------------------------------------------------------

It was a supercontinent made of other continents joined together. How does the occurrence of the same plant fossils in South America and Africa support continental drift? It is showing the once the continents were together and then drifted apart.

How did fossils provide evidence for the continents drifted?
------------------------------------------------------------

Fossils show that the continents drifted because similar fossils were found where the continents were together millions of years ago. For example, Africa and South America fit together like this:

What kind of fossils have been found in South America?
------------------------------------------------------

For example, fossils of ancient reptiles called Cynognathus and Mesosaurus have been found on South America and Africa. Also, fossils of the plant Glossopteris have been found on South America, Africa, India, Antarctica, and Australia.

Where are the mountain chains in continental drift?
---------------------------------------------------

Similar mountain chains run through eastern North America and the British Isles. Evidence-Rock types and structures. Land areas that show evidence of ancient glaciation are now located near the equator. Evidence-ancient climate. The Atlantic coastlines of South America and Africa fit together. Evidence-continental puzzle.
