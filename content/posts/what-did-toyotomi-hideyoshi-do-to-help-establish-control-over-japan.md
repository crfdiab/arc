What did Toyotomi Hideyoshi do to help establish control over Japan?

What did Hideyoshi do to consolidate his control of Japan?
----------------------------------------------------------

Did Toyotomi Hideyoshi conquer most of Japan?

-------------------------

Enter Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a man whose leadership skills and authoritative prowess helped him rise to become one of Nobunaga’s three right-hand men. After Nobunaga and his oldest son were assassinated in 1582, Hideyoshi avenged their deaths in the Battle of Yamazaki and made peace with a rival clan.

Who was Toyotomi Hideyoshi and what did he do?

Another of his followers, who would go down in history as Toyotomi Hideyoshi, in turn defeated Mitsuhide in battle, and ultimately completed Nobunaga’s task.

Subsequently, Hideyoshi was in a very strong position.

Why was Hideyoshi important to the Battle of Inabayama?
-------------------------------------------------------

Nobunaga’s easy victory at the siege of Inabayama Castle in 1567 was largely due to Hideyoshi’s efforts, and despite his peasant origins, in 1568 Hideyoshi became one of Nobunaga’s most distinguished generals, eventually taking the name Hashiba Hideyoshi (羽柴 秀吉).
