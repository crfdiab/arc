What is fault movement in earthquake?
-------------------------------------

A fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock. Faults allow the blocks to move relative to each other. This movement may occur rapidly, in the form of an earthquake – or may occur slowly, in the form of creep. The fault surface can be horizontal or vertical or some arbitrary angle in between.

Are earthquakes caused by the movements of faults only?
-------------------------------------------------------

Earthquakes are caused by shifts in the outer layers of Earth—a region called the lithosphere. This non-stop movement causes stress on Earth’s crust. When the stresses get too large, it leads to cracks called faults. When tectonic plates move, it also causes movements at the faults.

How does the movement of the fault generate earthquake?
-------------------------------------------------------

How does the movement of the fault generates earthquake? An earthquake is caused by a sudden slip on a fault, much like what happens when you snap your fingers. Stresses in the earth’s outer layer push the sides of the fault together.

What happens to the Earth during an earthquake?
-----------------------------------------------

The same process goes on in an earthquake. Stresses in the earth’s outer layer push the sides of the fault together. The friction across the surface of the fault holds the rocks together so they do not slip immediately when pushed sideways.

When does a fault move, you get a tsunami?
------------------------------------------

36\.  When a fault suddenly moves on land, you get an earthquake. But if a fault suddenly moves in or near a body of water, you may get a tsunami in addition to the earthquake. \*Not every fault movement beneath the sea will produce a tsunami. Those faults that move in a horizontal direction or sideways will not result in a tsunami.

How does a stick slip fault cause an earthquake?
------------------------------------------------

The stick-slip model of earthquake rupture is widely accepted. In this model, stresses build up along the fault surface until the strength of the rock at the fault is insufficient to withstand more build up. Two factors are involved: (1) the shear stress on the fault, and the normal stress across the fault.
