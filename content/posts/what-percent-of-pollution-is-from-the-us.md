What are the top polluters in the United States?
------------------------------------------------

A list called The Toxic 100 is maintained by the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI), an institute at the University off Massachusetts Amherst, of the United States’ top polluters. PERI uses a formula: Emissions (millions of pounds) x Toxicity x Population Exposure.
