How do northern hairy-nosed wombats reproduce?
----------------------------------------------

There’s very little data on reproduction and gestation of this species due to lack of observations in the wild. It’s known that have a monogamous mating system, where each individual mates with only one mate. Hairy-nosed wombats mate during spring and summer months, while young are born in November-March.

How do wombats breed?
---------------------

Mating has been observed in captive wombats; the female attacked the male for about 30 minutes before allowing him to mate. The mating lasted for about 30 minutes with both male and female laying on their sides. The male then bites the female’s rump and rolls her over on her side.

How many babies do northern hairy-nosed wombats have?
-----------------------------------------------------

one young  
Northern hairy-nosed wombats give birth to one young, usually in the warmer months between November and April. The young stay in the mother’s pouch for eight to nine months.

Is the northern hairy-nosed wombat a marsupial?
-----------------------------------------------

The northern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus krefftii) is one of the rarest mammals on earth, with only 230 of these marsupials left as of 2015, all living exclusively in animal wilderness sanctuaries. Lasiorhinus krefftii is the largest of three species of wombat, a marsupial found in Australia.

What eats the hairy-nosed wombat?
---------------------------------

Competition for food: The main competitor for food of the northern hairy-nosed wombats within the enclosure at Epping Forest National Park is the eastern grey kangaroo.

Why does the hairy-nosed wombat lack genetic diversity?
-------------------------------------------------------

Genetic analysis has confirmed that the species has less genetic variability than the closely related southern hairy- nosed wombat (Taylor et al., 1994). The species is therefore susceptible to genetic threats such as further loss of genetic variation, inbreeding and reduced resilience to disease.

Why do wombats poop cubes?
--------------------------

The researchers say the distinctive cube shape of wombat poop is caused as a result of the drying of the faeces in the colon, and muscular contractions, which form the uniform size and corners of the poop. “Bare-nosed wombats are renowned for producing distinctive, cube-shaped poos.

What eats the hairy nosed wombat?
---------------------------------

Is wombat poop cubed?
---------------------

A study published last month in Soft Matter reveals how the wombat’s intestines constrict to shape the scat. Bare-nosed wombats can excrete four to eight scat pieces at a time and may poop up to 100 cubes a day. After removing all nutritional content from food, the contractions shape the poop into a cube.

What are people doing to save the hairy-nosed wombat?
-----------------------------------------------------

In 2008 the Northern Hairy Nosed Recovery Plan was implemented by the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection, along with corporate sponsorship from mining company Xstrata. This saw the construction of a predator proof fence to protect the population from would-be predators and keep out competition species.

How is the northern hairy nosed wombat different from the common wombat?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Classification The northern hairy-nosed wombat shares its genus with one other extant species, the southern hairy-nosed wombat, while the common wombat is in the genus Vombatus. Both Lasiorhinus species differ morphologically from the common wombat by their silkier fur, broader hairy noses, and longer ears.

How long does it take for a wombat to breed?
--------------------------------------------

One source states that wombats in general can reach full size and be ready to breed in a little over 2 years under ideal conditions, but in the wild this usually takes 3 years. The Southern Hairy-nosed wombat usually gives birth in the spring from September or October to January.

How many species of wombats are there in Australia?
---------------------------------------------------

Australia has three species of wombat: the common wombat, northern hairy-nosed wombat and southern hairy-nosed wombat. The common wombat occupies coastal and high country areas in south-eastern Australia, whereas the hairy-nosed wombats are more arid-adapted.

How do wombats cope with a hot dry climate?
-------------------------------------------

Another way of coping with a hot dry climate is that they are nocturnal so the hotter periods of the day are avoided by sending the time in their burrow, emerging to feed at night when its cooler. The wombats dig very complex tunnels that link to multiple burrows of up to 5 wombats, these are called warrens.
