How many people died from the Wahine?
-------------------------------------

51 people  
On 10 April 1968, during an exceptional storm, the inter-island ferry Wahine struck Barrett Reef in Wellington Harbour and capsized. 51 people died.

What happened to the Wahine after it sank?
------------------------------------------

As if Wellington needed a further reminder of the sea’s destructive power following the Wahine disaster, a fierce storm a year after the tragedy broke the wrecked ship into pieces and ruined its salvage operation. Four months later the Wahine still lay on its side, eerily, just 400 metres off the Seatoun coast.

Why was the Wahine disaster significant?
----------------------------------------

“This tragedy led to improved safety procedures on ships and prompted the creation of two significant rescue services: the Wellington Volunteer Coastguard and the Life Flight Trust.”

How did the Wahine disaster affect people?
------------------------------------------

Fifty-one people lost their lives that day, another died several weeks later and a 53rd victim died in 1990 from injuries sustained in the wreck. The Wahine’s demise also marked a coming of age for television news broadcasting in New Zealand as images of the disaster were beamed into the nation’s living rooms.

What year did Wahine sink?
--------------------------

10 April 1968  
On the morning of 10 April 1968 the Lyttelton–Wellington ferry Wahine was blown off course by a severe storm after its steering failed as it attempted to enter Wellington Harbour. When the ship struck Barrett Reef, its starboard propeller was ripped off.

How many people died in the Wahine ferry disaster?
--------------------------------------------------

The ship entered Cook Strait just as Cyclone Giselle swept south. The Wahine rolled violently back and forth as it made its way in the storm in winds of up to 100 knots, but came through undamaged. Then, in the early hours of 10 April, the ferry ran aground and capsized at the entrance to Wellington Harbour. 53 people lost their lives.
