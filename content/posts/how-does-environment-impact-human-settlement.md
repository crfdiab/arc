How does environment impact human settlement?
---------------------------------------------

The natural environment provides the basic elements that human beings need to survive such as food, water and shelter (Box 5.1). The impact of human settlements on the environment increases with population growth, settlement expansion, economic growth and increased consumption.

How can weathering harm human settlements?
------------------------------------------

Weathered Rock materials are used by people for construction purposes such as the building or homes or the construction of bridges and roads in rural areas. 12. Negative Impacts • Erosion by flowing water during floods causes extensive damage to human properties and they also destroy lives.

Why is human settlement important?
----------------------------------

Cities, the largest and densest human settlements, are the major nodes of human society. Settlements and the patterns they etch on Earth’s surface provide not only information on current economic, political, and social conditions, but also a historical record of past conditions.

How does climate affect the settlement of people?
-------------------------------------------------

Humans tend to settle in areas where climate is survivable. How well they survive depends upon their adaptation and technology. Inuits would probably not survive in Bale; natives of Bali would probably not survive in the Arctic. The climate sets the scene for the adaptations the local inhabitant make to be able to survive.

What are the factors that affect human settlement?
--------------------------------------------------

Factors Affecting Human Settlement Physical Factors One of the most basic factors affecting settlement patterns is the physical geography of the land. Climate is key, because if a place is too dry, too cold or too hot, it’s more difficult for large numbers of people to settle there, especially if they make their living from farming.

How does human activity affect the climate of an area?
------------------------------------------------------

In some areas, human activity has changed the local climate – salt building up in the soil from irrigation, deforestation perhaps leading to desertification – and other aspects affecting the carrying capacity of an area, such as hunting food species to extinction. Humans tend to settle in areas where climate is survivable.

When did people transition from nomadic life to settlement?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The transition from nomadic life to farming and settlements began thousands of years ago, in areas with favorable weather and tolerable seasons.
