What direction would a destructive plate move?
----------------------------------------------

A destructive plate boundary happens where an oceanic and continental plate move towards each other. The heavier, more dense oceanic plate is forced under the continental plate. As it sinks below the continental plate the oceanic plate melts due to friction in the subduction zone.

What is collision plate tectonics?
----------------------------------

Continental collision is a phenomenon of the plate tectonics of Earth that occurs at convergent boundaries. Continental collision is a variation on the fundamental process of subduction, whereby the subduction zone is destroyed, mountains produced, and two continents sutured together.

How are plates moving at a destructive boundary?
------------------------------------------------

At a destructive boundary the plates are moving towards each other. This usually involves a continental plate and an oceanic plate. The oceanic plate is denser than the continental plate. As they move together, the oceanic plate is forced underneath the continental plate. The point at which this happens is called the subduction zone.

What are the effects of a destructive plate margin?
---------------------------------------------------

Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions affect people all over the world. They are caused by the movement of tectonic plates. Tectonic hazards can destroy buildings, infrastructure and cause deaths. A destructive plate margin usually involves an oceanic plate and a continental plate.

What are the different types of plate movement?
-----------------------------------------------

4 Types Of Tectonic Plate Movement. 1 Divergent Boundaries. Divergent boundaries occur when a specific movement happens between the plates. This movement is the plates pulling away from 2 Convergent Boundaries. 3 Transform Fault Boundaries And Plate Boundary Zones.

How does the movement of tectonic plates cause earthquakes?
-----------------------------------------------------------

They are caused by the movement of tectonic plates. Tectonic hazards can destroy buildings, infrastructure and cause deaths. A destructive plate margin usually involves an oceanic plate and a continental plate. The plates move towards one another and this movement can cause earthquakes.
