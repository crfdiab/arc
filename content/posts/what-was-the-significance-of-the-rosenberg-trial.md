What was the significance of the Rosenberg trial?
-------------------------------------------------

The 1951 trial of Julius Rosenberg, Ethel Rosenberg, and Morton Sobell, Communists accused of conspiring to commit espionage for the Soviet Union, drew worldwide attention at a time of heightened American concerns about nuclear warfare, Soviet aggression, and Communist subversion.

How did Julius Greenglass testify in the Rosenberg trial?
---------------------------------------------------------

Since the Rosenbergs were being charged with conspiracy, no tangible evidence was required. Greenglass secretly testified before a grand jury in August 1950. In this testimony he named Julius and claimed he was recruited to join the Soviet spy ring by him.

When did Julius Rosenberg get sentenced to death?
-------------------------------------------------

On March 29, 1951, the court convicted Julius and Ethel Rosenberg of conspiracy to commit espionage. On April 5, Judge Kaufman sentenced them to death\]

When did Julius and Ethel Rosenberg get arrested?
-------------------------------------------------

He also named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg as contacts and denied that his wife, Ruth Greenglass, was involved with any espionage activities. On July 17, 1950 the FBI arrested Julius, and one month later Ethel was arrested. On March 6, 1951 their trial began in New York’s Southern District federal court. The trial lasted for nearly one month.

What did Julius Rosenberg do for the Soviet Union?
--------------------------------------------------

Julius Rosenberg engaged in non-atomic espionage for the Soviet Union during the 1940’s. At least nine months after the Soviets suspended their relationship with Julius, the Greenglasses delivered atomic information of relatively little value to the Soviet Union without the Rosenbergs’ assistance.

Why did Julius Rosenberg plead the Fifth Amendment?
---------------------------------------------------

During the trial, both Ethel and Julius pleaded the Fifth Amendment when asked repeated questions related to espionage, and when questioned about being members of the Communist Party.

What was the charge that the Rosenbergs were charged with?
----------------------------------------------------------

He was executed, along with his wife, Ethel, on June 19, 1953, a few weeks before it ended. The legal charge of which the Rosenbergs were convicted was vague: “Conspiracy to Commit Espionage.” But in a practical sense they were held accountable for giving the so-called “secret of the atomic bomb” to the USSR.
