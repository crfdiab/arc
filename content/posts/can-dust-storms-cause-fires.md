Can dust storms cause fires?
----------------------------

Dry thunderstorms occur essentially in dry conditions, and their lightning is a major cause of wildfires.

Do dust storms cause hurricanes?
--------------------------------

And then they sometimes develop into hurricanes.” The researchers suspected that Saharan dust storms sometimes prevent disturbance waves from intensifying into tropical storms and then hurricanes. “We think a dust storm has three main components that can suppress a hurricane,” Dunion continued.

What damage can dust storms cause?
----------------------------------

Prolonged exposure to airborne dust can lead to chronic breathing and lung problems, and possibly heart disease.

Is the dust storm dangerous?
----------------------------

Dust storms — and their lingering effects — can be hazardous for several reasons: A dust storm’s initial wall of dust and debris can arrive suddenly and can catch people by surprise. Dust storms can make it difficult to see when you’re driving a car and can lead to car accidents.

Will Florida be hit by a hurricane in 2020?
-------------------------------------------

A leading Atlantic forecast calls for 17 named storms, eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes in 2021. Florida escaped the record-breaking 2020 storm season without a single hurricane making landfall along its 1,350 miles of coastline.

Is there dust in the air from Africa?
-------------------------------------

Plumes of dust continuously push westward off the coast of Africa during the months of June, July and August. This happens as tropical waves and their corresponding stronger winds over Central Africa loft vast amounts of dust into the atmosphere.

How are Saharan dust storms different from hurricanes?
------------------------------------------------------

“One, it’s got super-dry air. Hurricanes don’t like dry air in the middle parts of the atmosphere, and that’s exactly what the Saharan Air Layer has. A Saharan dust storm also has a very strong surge of air embedded within it, called the mid-level easterly jet, that can rip a storm apart that’s trying to develop.

How does a dust storm form in a desert?
---------------------------------------

A dust storm, also called sandstorm, is a meteorological phenomenon common in arid and semi-arid regions. Dust storms arise when a gust front or other strong wind blows loose sand and dirt from a dry surface. Fine particles are transported by saltation and suspension, a process that moves soil from one place and deposits it in another.

How often does Saharan dust affect the United States?
-----------------------------------------------------

That Saharan dust keenly interests Dunion, a research meteorologist from the NOAA Hurricane Research Division in Miami. He said, “The Saharan Air Layer is essentially a huge dust storm that can be the size of the continental United States. Every three to five days during the summertime, these storms roll off of the African coast.”

What are the long term effects of dust storms?
----------------------------------------------

Short-term effects of exposure to desert dust include immediate increased symptoms and worsening of the lung function in individuals with asthma, increased mortality and morbidity from long-transported dust from both Saharan and Asian dust storms suggesting that long-transported dust storm particles adversely affects the circulatory system.
