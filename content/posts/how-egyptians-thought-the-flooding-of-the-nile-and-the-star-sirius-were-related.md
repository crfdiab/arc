How Egyptians thought the flooding of the Nile and the star Sirius were related?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Predicting the flood of the Nile became very important because two month after the flood people could plant seeds in the fruitful soil. In that period Egyptian astronomers observed that each time the star Sirius appeared for the first time at the Eastern part of the sky just before sunrise, the Nile flood took place.

What role did Sirius play in ancient Egypt?
-------------------------------------------

Sirius played a significant role in every aspect of Ancient Egypt culture, a role that carried on well into the 20th century, because its heliacal rising in mid-August each year was the signal from the natural world that the mighty river Nile was about to flood.

Which group used the star Sirius to see that the Nile River flooded at the same time every year?

Why is Sirius so important?
---------------------------

The heliacal rising of Sirius marked the flooding of the Nile in Ancient Egypt and the “dog days” of summer for the ancient Greeks, while to the Polynesians, mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, the star marked winter and was an important reference for their navigation around the Pacific Ocean.

What happened each year with the heliacal rising of Sirius?
-----------------------------------------------------------

During a Sothic cycle, the 365 day year loses enough time that the start of its year once again coincides with the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (Ancient Egyptian: Spdt or Sopdet, ‘Triangle’; Greek: Σῶθις, Sō̂this) on 19 July in the Julian calendar.

Is Sirius hotter than Sun?
--------------------------

At 8.6 light-years distance, Sirius is one of the nearest stars to us after the sun. That means it’s a much hotter star than our sun; its surface temperature is about 17,000 degrees Fahrenheit (9,400 Celsius) in contrast to our sun’s 10,000 degrees F (5,500 C).

Is Hapi a boy or girl?

How is Sirius related to the ancient Egyptians?
-----------------------------------------------

Ancient Egyptians held Sirius in such a high regard that most of their deities were associated, in some way or another, with the star. Anubis, the dog-headed god of death, had an obvious connection with the dog star and Toth-Hermes, the great teacher of humanity, was also esoterically connected with the star.

How old is the Nile Dam in Sirius?
----------------------------------

Still, Sirius continues to rise, and ceremonies celebrating the annual flood still occur, which is understandable, given that the dam is not quite 50 years old, but the cultural life inspired by the Nile’s annual flooding has existed through all ages of recorded history, and was rooted in the stars.

How did the star Sirius get its name?
-------------------------------------

The name Sirius is derived from the Ancient Greek ‘Seirios’, which means ‘glowing’ or ‘scorcher’. The brightest star has been important in astronomy, mythology and occultism for thousands of years, which is evidenced by its inclusion on artifacts from ancient civilizations.

Where does Sirius appear in the night sky?
------------------------------------------

Sirius is behind the sun as seen from Earth in Northern Hemisphere summer. In late summer, it appears in the east before sunrise, near the sun in our sky. The early stargazers might have imagined the double-whammy of Sirius and the sun caused the hot weather, or dog days.
