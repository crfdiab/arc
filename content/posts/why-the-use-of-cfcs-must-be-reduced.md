Why the use of CFCs must be reduced?
------------------------------------

Because CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, and they are being replaced with other products such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) including R-410A and R-134a.

Does Freon really deplete the ozone layer?
------------------------------------------

Freon is the general name, and chemical name is Fluoric-carbon (chemical materials bonding Fluoride and carbon), among which CFC (Chloro-fluoric Carbon: designated Freon) and HCFC (Hydro Chloro-fluoric carbon: designated Freon) destroy Ozone layer in space.

How can we help the ozone layer?
--------------------------------

How can we protect the ozone layer?

1. Avoid the consumption of gases dangerous to the ozone layer, due to their content or manufacturing process.
2. Minimize the use of cars.
3. Do not use cleaning products that are harmful to the environment and to us.
4. Buy local products.

What would happen if we stopped emitting co2 today?
---------------------------------------------------

Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes still. However, if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, the rise in global temperatures would begin to flatten within a few years. Temperatures would then plateau but remain well-elevated for many, many centuries.

What freon is being banned?
---------------------------

R-22  
Freon, also known as R-22, will no longer be made or imported to the United States, starting January 1st, 2020. The Environmental Protection Agency said the odorless gas, which is one of the key refrigerants in air conditioners, is bad for the environment because it depletes the ozone layer.

How do they destroy the ozone layer?
------------------------------------

Ozone Depletion. When chlorine and bromine atoms come into contact with ozone in the stratosphere, they destroy ozone molecules. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the stratosphere. When they break down, they release chlorine or bromine atoms, which then deplete ozone.

How can we reduce the amount of CFCs in the atmosphere?
-------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, CFCs are also extremely useful for many purposes, and are used in refrigerants, aerosols and solvents. Since 1987, the Montreal Protocol has drastically reduced the amount of CFCs released into the atmosphere. You can also do your part as an individual or business owner through careful disposal methods and product choices.

How are chlorofluorocarbons used in refrigeration?
--------------------------------------------------

That stratospheric ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation that otherwise would reach the surface of Earth. At the time, CFCs were in wide use in refrigeration, air conditioning and aerosol spray cans. The compounds are inert and essentially nontoxic, characteristics that made them well-suited for these applications.

Why are chlorofluorocarbons banned in the world?
------------------------------------------------

Why were CFCs banned? Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are a group of odourless manufactured chemicals. Because they damage the earth’s ozone layer, CFCs have been banned since 1996. Depletion of the Ozone Layer will have a negative impact on the biodiversity of the earth itself.

How long do chlorofluorocarbons stay in the atmosphere?
-------------------------------------------------------

These compounds are chemically inert and may remain in the atmosphere for 40-150 years, and concentrations can be expected to reach 10 to 30 times present levels. Photodissociation of the chlorofluoromethanes in the stratosphere produces significant amounts of chlorine atoms, and leads to the destruction of atmospheric ozone.”
