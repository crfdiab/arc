Why do rainforest trees not have deep roots?
--------------------------------------------

Because the soil in many rainforests can be poor, tree roots often grow near the ground surface in order to get the nutrients it needs to grow. But this solution also causes problems. As the trees grow taller, the root system is not strong enough to support the trees.

Do rainforest trees have shallow roots?
---------------------------------------

Rainforests have a shallow layer of fertile soil, so trees only need shallow roots to reach the nutrients. However, shallow roots can’t support huge rainforest trees, so many tropical trees have developed huge buttress roots.

Why do tropical trees have shallow roots?
-----------------------------------------

Tropical plants are generally native to large rain forest systems where shallow root systems are a requirement for taking in nutrients. Their surface roots make up a large network that is used to taking in nutrients from decaying leaf debris breaking down on the soil’s surface.

What type of roots do rainforest trees have?
--------------------------------------------

…rainforest trees, large woody prop roots develop from adventitious roots on horizontal branches and provide additional anchorage and support. Many bulbous plants have contractile adventitious roots that pull the bulb deeper into the ground as it grows.

Do tropical trees have deep roots?
----------------------------------

Many tropical species have roots that actually grow out of the ground to form a mat on the forest floor in order to more efficiently collect nutrients. To counter this, many tree species have extensive root systems that in some cases may run for over 325 feet (100 m).

How do I make my plants dark green?
-----------------------------------

Fertilizer won’t solve all of your plant problems, so make sure your plants have good light, good soil, and good drainage. The three most important nutrients are nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. Nitrogen is used for above ground growth. This is what gives plants a dark green color.

How tall are the roots of a rainforest tree?
--------------------------------------------

The configuration of shallow roots and great height causes a great deal of instability for rainforest trees, especially with wet soils and strong winds of the upper canopy that can accompany tropical storms. To counter this, many tree species have extensive root systems that in some cases may run for over 325 feet (100 m).

Why do tree roots grow in deep soil?
------------------------------------

The conclusion here is that tree roots follow the oxygen-rich macropores, whether they are in deep or shallow soils. The volume of this soil type determines above else how large the trees will grow.

How deep does a tree root system have to be?
--------------------------------------------

This is the largest root depth study to date, in terms of total numbers and variety of species. Based on this study, one can safely say that no trees will have any difficulty growing down 4 feet \[1.2 meters\], the approximate depth of a 3 Silva Cell-deep system, in oxygen rich soils.

Where are the best places for tree roots to grow?
-------------------------------------------------

Soil near the surface commonly has the highest nutrient concentrations, good aeration and warm temperatures, so is ideally suited for root growth. Consequently, most tree roots are found near the surface.
