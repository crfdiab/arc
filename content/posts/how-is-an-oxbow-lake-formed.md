How is an oxbow lake formed?
----------------------------

An oxbow lake starts out as a curve, or meander, in a river. A lake forms as the river finds a different, shorter, course. The meander becomes an oxbow lake along the side of the river. Oxbow lakes usually form in flat, low-lying plains close to where the river empties into another body of water.

What is an example of an oxbow lake?
------------------------------------

A true oxbow lake, Lake Chicot in Arkansas is the largest oxbow lake in North America and was formed over 600 years ago from the meandering of the Mississippi River. This lake is also the state of Arkansasâ€™s largest naturally formed lake.

Why does an oxbow lake form?
----------------------------

Oxbow lake The river flows faster on the outside bends and erodes them. Often during a flood the river will cut through the neck. The river continues on its straighter path and the meander is abandoned. New deposition seals off the ends and the cut-off becomes an oxbow lake that will eventually dry up.

What causes the formation of an oxbow lake?
-------------------------------------------

Explain the formation of an oxbow lake. Due to erosion on the outside of a bend and deposition on the inside, the shape of a meander will change over a period of time. Erosion narrows the neck of the land within the meander and as the process continues, the meanders move closer together.

What do you use to make an oxbow lake?
--------------------------------------

Partly fill the bowl with water and sprinkle dense particles such as sand or rice into the bowl. Set the water into circular motion with one hand or a spoon. The dense particles will quickly be swept into a neat pile in the center of the bowl.

How does the Oxbow river make a shortcut?
-----------------------------------------

The river makes a shortcut. Oxbow lakes are the remains of the bend in the river. Oxbow lakes are stillwater lakes. This means that water does not flow into or out of them. There is no stream or spring feeding the lake, and it doesnt have a natural outlet. Oxbow lakes often become swamp s or bog s, and they often dry up as their water evaporate s.

What makes the banks of oxbow lake concave?
-------------------------------------------

On these plains, rivers often have wide meanders. Meanders that form oxbow lakes have two sets of curves: one curving away from the straight path of the river and one curving back. The corners of the curves closest to each other are called concave bank s. The concave banks erode over time.
