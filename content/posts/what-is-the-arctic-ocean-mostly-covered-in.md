What is the Arctic ocean mostly covered in?
-------------------------------------------

ice  
Most of the Arctic Ocean is covered by ice throughout the year—although that is starting to change as temperatures climb.

How much does the Arctic ocean take up?
---------------------------------------

The Arctic Ocean is about 5.4 million square miles—about 1.5 times as big as the US—but it is the world’s smallest ocean.

Which pole does the Arctic ocean cover?
---------------------------------------

The North Pole  
The North Pole sits in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, on water that is almost always covered with ice. The ice is about 2-3 meters (6-10 feet) thick. The depth of the ocean at the North Pole is more than 4,000 meters (13,123 feet).

How much of the Arctic Ocean is covered in ice?
-----------------------------------------------

Much of the Arctic Ocean is covered by sea ice that varies in extent and thickness seasonally. The mean extent of the ice has been decreasing since 1980 from the average winter value of 15,600,000 km 2 (6,023,200 sq mi) at a rate of 3% per decade.

When did the Arctic sea ice pack change?
----------------------------------------

This visual shows the Arctic sea ice change and the corresponding absorbed solar radiation change during June, July, and August from 2000 through 2014. The Arctic ice pack is the sea ice cover of the Arctic Ocean and its vicinity.

Can a summer maximum of Arctic sea ice be predicted?
----------------------------------------------------

Sea ice extent at the winter maximum doesn’t predict the summer minimum extent with any reliability. Summer weather conditions in the Arctic Ocean exert tremendous influence on the minimum extent, and those conditions cannot be predicted from sea ice extent at the end of winter. Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis. (2020, March 24).

How can you see life in the Arctic Ocean?
-----------------------------------------

Much of the Arctic Ocean’s complex life can only be seen by underwater explorers who dive through holes in thick sea ice. Much of the ocean here is dark, blocked from sunlight by ice cover, but photographers have dived with lights to expose underwater Arctic life. (See those photos here.)
