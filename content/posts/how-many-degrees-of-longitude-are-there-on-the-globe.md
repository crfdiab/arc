How many degrees of longitude are there on the globe?
-----------------------------------------------------

360 degrees  
There are 360 degrees of longitude (+180° eastward and −180° westward.). The longitude line of 0 degrees is known as the Prime Meridian and it divides the world into the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere.

Is there a total of 360 degrees of longitude on the globe?
----------------------------------------------------------

A circle is divided into 4 quarters of 90 degrees each. Longitude lines pass through the north and south poles. If you stood above the earth and looked down on the north pole from above, you would see the complete circle of the equator. So longitude goes from zero to 360 degrees.

What are the degrees for longitude?
-----------------------------------

Longitude is measured 180° both east and west of the prime meridian. As aids to locate longitudinal positions on a globe or map, meridians are plotted and drawn from pole to pole where they meet. The distance per degree of longitude at the Equator is about 111.32 km (69.18 miles) and at the poles, 0.

What is the highest longitude on the globe?
-------------------------------------------

180� meridian  
Lines of longitude (meridians) running north-south around the globe measure distances EAST and WEST of the Prime Meridian. Directly on the opposite side of the earth from the prime meridian is located the 180� meridian. This is the highest longitude possible.

What is the name of 90 degrees latitude?
----------------------------------------

The Equator is the line of 0 degrees latitude. Each parallel measures one degree north or south of the Equator, with 90 degrees north of the Equator and 90 degrees south of the Equator. The latitude of the North Pole is 90 degrees N, and the latitude of the South Pole is 90 degrees S.

How many degrees of longitude are there in the world?
-----------------------------------------------------

Longitude is defined as imaginary lines called meridians that run from the north to the south pole. There are a total of 360 meridians. The Prime Meridianruns through the Greenwich Observatory in England, the location agreed upon by a conference in 1884 to be 0 degrees.

What is the distance per degree of longitude at the equator?
------------------------------------------------------------

As aids to locate longitudinal positions on a globe or map, meridians are plotted and drawn from pole to pole where they meet. The distance per degree of longitude at the Equator is about 111.32 km (69.18 miles) and at the poles, 0. Get exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription.

Where do the degrees of latitude and longitude converge?
--------------------------------------------------------

They are farthest apart at the equator and converge at the poles. A degree of longitude is widest at the equator with a distance of 69.172 miles (111.321 kilometers). The distance gradually shrinks to zero as they meet at the poles.

How many meridians are there on the globe?
------------------------------------------

A longitude line, or a meridian, is any line that runs from the north pole to the south pole. Technically speaking, there are an infinite number of these. The useful ones correspond to degrees, and that makes 360.
