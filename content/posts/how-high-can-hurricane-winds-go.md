How high can hurricane winds go?
--------------------------------

To be classified as a hurricane, a tropical cyclone must have one-minute-average maximum sustained winds at 10 m above the surface of at least 74 mph (Category 1). The highest classification in the scale, Category 5, consists of storms with sustained winds of at least 157 mph.

Do Hurricanes have the strongest winds?
---------------------------------------

The strongest winds in a northern hemisphere tropical cyclone is located in the eyewall and the right front quadrant of the tropical cyclone. A 100 mph hurricane while stationary, might have winds of 100 mph on its right side in the northern hemisphere while the rest of the storm might have winds at 70 mph.

What’s the average wind speed of a hurricane?
---------------------------------------------

That means that hurricane-force winds are unlikely to exceed 200 mph (322 km/h), Landsea said.

Which is the highest category a hurricane can reach?
----------------------------------------------------

While all hurricanes produce life-threatening winds, hurricanes rated Category 3 and higher are known as major hurricanes\*. Major hurricanes can cause devastating to catastrophic wind damage and significant loss of life simply due to the strength of their winds.

Is there a limit to how strong a hurricane can get?
---------------------------------------------------

But physics dictates there must be a limit. Based on ocean and atmospheric conditions on Earth nowadays, the estimated maximum potential for hurricanes is about 190 mph (305 km/h), according to a 1998 calculation by Kerry Emanuel, a climatologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This upper limit is not absolute, however.

What happens to wind turbines during a hurricane?
-------------------------------------------------

Recent hurricanes Irma and Maria inflicted a lot of damage on infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. Wind turbines, whether they are land-based or offshore, have built-in mechanisms to lock and feather the blades (reducing the surface area that’s pointing into the wind) when wind speeds exceed 55 miles per hour.
