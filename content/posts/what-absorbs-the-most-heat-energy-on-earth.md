What absorbs the most heat energy on Earth?
-------------------------------------------

atmosphere  
Heat Transfer Of the energy that reaches the Earth from the Sun, a small amount is absorbed by the atmosphere, a larger amount (about 30%) is reflected back to space by clouds and the Earth’s surface, and most of it is absorbed at the planet surface and then released as heat.

What absorbs heat energy the fastest?
-------------------------------------

Assuming the same proper heat and thermal conductivity, liquids will absorb the heat faster because:

- In the solids, the only mechanism for the heat transport is conduction. In liquids, there is an additional mechanism of convection which is pretty efficient.
- When solids touch, they never touch perfectly. Which surface is good absorber of heat?
    ---------------------------------------
    
    black matte surfaces  
    When it comes to radiation, the surface of an object plays an important role. The black matte surfaces absorb the radiation and as they become warm after absorbing the radiation they start emitting the radiation. Therefore, a black surface is a good absorber and a good emitter.
    
    Which region of the planet absorbs the most heat?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    The ocean is the largest solar energy collector on Earth. Not only does water cover more than 70 percent of our planet’s surface, it can also absorb large amounts of heat without a large increase in temperature.
    
    What material absorbs the most energy?
    --------------------------------------
    
    Sorbothane®  
    Sorbothane® has been recognized as the highest performance, energy-absorbing material since 1982 and is recognized as the industry standard. Consider Sorbothane’s unique properties: A high tan delta value or damping coefficient. Absorbs more than 94% of shock energy.
    
    What colors absorb the most heat?
    ---------------------------------
    
    The more light the object absorbs, the more heat absorbed since light is energy. If you consider it a color, black absorbs the most heat. A black object absorbs all wavelengths of light and reflects none. Objects that are white, on the other hand, reflect all wavelengths of light and therefore absorb the least heat.
    
    Is black a good absorber?
    -------------------------
    
    As u know black body is good absorber because it absorbs all kinds of EMF light wave. Similarly black body is the best radiator of heat and wave. So black body gains amd drains heat faster than other like a good conducter.
    
    Is a shiny surface a good absorber of heat?
    -------------------------------------------
    
    Different surfaces Shiny surfaces are poor absorbers and emitters (but they are good reflectors of infrared radiation). If two objects made from the same material have identical volumes, a thin, flat object will radiate heat energy faster than a fat object.
    
    What are two main ways the sun’s energy gets redistributed across the Earth?
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Clouds, aerosols, water vapor, and ozone directly absorb 23 percent of incoming solar energy. Evaporation and convection transfer 25 and 5 percent of incoming solar energy from the surface to the atmosphere. These three processes transfer the equivalent of 53 percent of the incoming solar energy to the atmosphere.
    
    Which is the material that absorbs the most heat?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    The most conductive naturally occurring material is diamond, followed by other pure metals. The most conductive material known is helium II, a superfluid isotope of helium that has over 45 times the absorption of natural diamonds. The ability for a material to truly absorb heat and store it is different from its ability to conduct it.
    
    How is heat absorption defined in thermodynamics?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    Heat Absorption In thermodynamics, internal energy (also called the thermal energy) is defined as the energy associated with microscopic forms of energy. It is an extensive quantity, it depends on the size of the system, or on the amount of substance it contains. The SI unit of internal energy is the joule (J).
    
    Where does the most heat from the sun come from?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    Most heat from the sun arrives as infrared energy. Sandwiched between infrared and UV is the visible spectrum, which contains all the colors we see on Earth. The color red has the longest wavelengths (closest to infrared), and violet (closest to UV) the shortest.
    
    Why does the southern hemisphere get more energy than the northern hemisphere?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The Southern Hemisphere receives more energy during December (southern summer) than the Northern Hemisphere does in June (northern summer) because Earth’s orbit is not a perfect circle and Earth is slightly closer to the Sun during that part of its orbit.
