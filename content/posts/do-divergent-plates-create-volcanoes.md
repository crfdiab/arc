Do divergent plates create volcanoes?
-------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseMost volcanoes form at the boundaries of Earth’s tectonic plates. The two types of plate boundaries that are most likely to produce volcanic activity are divergent plate boundaries and convergent plate boundaries. Divergent Plate Boundaries. At a divergent boundary, tectonic plates move apart from one another.

Can a divergent plate make a trench?
------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseNo, ocean trenches do not occur at divergent plate boundaries. They are formed at convergent boundaries.

Do divergent plates cause earthquakes?
--------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseDivergent boundaries are associated with volcanic activity and the earthquakes in these zones tend to be frequent and small. Continental collisions result in the creation of mountains and fold belts as the rocks are forced upwards. Plates can move towards each other at a boundary.

How are divergent plates different from convergent plates?
----------------------------------------------------------

Unlike convergent boundaries, divergence occurs between only oceanic or only continental plates, not one of each. The vast majority of divergent boundaries are found in the ocean, where they were not mapped or understood until the mid-to-late 20th century. In divergent zones, the plates are pulled, and not pushed, apart.

Where do most divergent plate boundaries take place?
----------------------------------------------------

Unlike convergent boundaries, divergence occurs between only oceanic or only continental plates, not one of each. The vast majority of divergent boundaries are found in the ocean, where they were not mapped or understood until the mid-to-late 20th century.

What happens when two plates move away from each other?
-------------------------------------------------------

What does a divergent plate boundary do? A divergent boundary occurs when two tectonic plates move away from each other. Along these boundaries , earthquakes are common and magma (molten rock) rises from the Earth’s mantle to the surface, solidifying to create new oceanic crust.

What are the effects of a divergent boundary?
---------------------------------------------

Effects that are found at a divergent boundary between oceanic plates include: a submarine mountain range such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge; volcanic activity in the form of fissure eruptions; shallow earthquake activity; creation of new seafloor and a widening ocean basin.
