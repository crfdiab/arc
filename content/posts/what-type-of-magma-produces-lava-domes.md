What type of magma produces lava domes?
---------------------------------------

viscous magma  
Lava domes are formed by viscous magma being erupted effusively onto the surface and then piling up around the vent. Like lava flows, they typically do not have enough gas or pressure to erupt explosively, although they may sometimes be preceded or followed by explosive activity.

Do dome volcanoes have thick lava?
----------------------------------

Volcanic or lava domes are formed by relatively small, bulbous masses of lava too viscous to flow any great distance; consequently, on extrusion, the lava piles over and around its vent. A dome grows largely by expansion from within.

What materials come out of a lava dome volcano?
-----------------------------------------------

Lava domes can explode violently, releasing a huge amount of hot rock and ash. Lava domes may be rounded, pancake-shaped, or irregular piles of rock, depending on the type of lava they form from.

What kind of lava is in a dome volcano?
---------------------------------------

The Mono-Inyo Craters in California were created by steam eruptions and then covered over by small lava domes. Lava domes are usually constructed of dacite and rhyolite lavas that are very stiff. The dacite lava forming the dome in Mount Saint Helens is one million times stiffer than the lava that erupts from the Hawaiian Island volcanoes.

What kind of rock is a dome mountain made of?
---------------------------------------------

They are usually composed of igneous rock and could have been the magma chamber of a once active volcano. Dome Mountains. A dome mountain is an exposed body of magma that has hardened into a dome-shape. Unlike a batholith, smaller bodies of magma are used to create these landforms.

What happens when a dome volcano erupts?
----------------------------------------

Dome Volcano. A dome volcano is small and often forms inside the caldera of a stratovolcano. After a large eruption when large amount of magma has emptied out of the magma chamber the summit of the composite volcano collapses forming a depression.

Can a dome volcano form inside a caldera?
-----------------------------------------

Dome Volcano A lava dome is small and often forms inside the caldera of a stratovolcano. Volcano Facts Find out lots of fascinating facts and trivia about volcanoes on this webpage.
