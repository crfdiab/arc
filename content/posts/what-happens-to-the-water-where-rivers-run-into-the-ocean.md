What happens to the water where rivers run into the ocean?
----------------------------------------------------------

When Rivers Run Into The Ocean. Where rivers meet the ocean is called the mouth of the river. Soil and dirt carried by these rivers is deposited at the mouth, and new land is formed. Like all large rivers, the Amazon deposits a lot of soil and sediment, forming a delta, as it enters the ocean.

What is the water like where a river meets the ocean?
-----------------------------------------------------

An estuary is an area where a freshwater river or stream meets the ocean. When freshwater and seawater combine, the water becomes brackish, or slightly salty.

Where does river water go in the ocean?
---------------------------------------

This then flows into rivers, which flow into the sea. Fertilisers contain lots of nitrogen and this is great for growing plants – they love the stuff. The problem with having lots of nitrogen in the ocean is that it causes huge plankton blooms. Plankton are little plant-like things floating everywhere in the ocean, basically tiny sea plants.

How much of the earth’s water goes into the oceans?
---------------------------------------------------

That is about 96.5 percent of all Earth’s water. It is also estimated that the oceans supply about 90 percent of the evaporated water that goes into the water cycle. The water in the oceans is saline (saltwater), but, what do we mean by “saline water?” Saline water contains significant amounts (referred to as “concentrations”) of dissolved salts.

Why are the oceans important to the water cycle?
------------------------------------------------

The oceans are, by far, the largest reservoir of water on earth — over 96% of all of Earth’s water exists in the oceans. Not only do the oceans provide evaporated water to the water cycle, they also allow water to move all around the globe as ocean currents.

How are the mouths of rivers affected by sea levels?
----------------------------------------------------

Estuaries at the mouths of rivers have in the past handled rising ocean levels. Sediment that accumulates along the edge of an estuary can raise the level of the land as the sea levels rise.
