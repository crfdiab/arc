How does NASA send rover to Mars?
---------------------------------

Like NASA’s Curiosity rover (, the Mars 2020 spacecraft uses a guided entry, descent, and landing system. The landing system on Mars 2020 mission includes a parachute, descent vehicle, and an approach called a “skycrane maneuver” for lowering the rover on a tether to the surface during the final seconds before landing.

How long will it take the rover to get to Mars?
-----------------------------------------------

around seven months  
It took around seven months for Nasa’s perseverance rover to reach the red planet. Nasa’s Perseverance rover has landed safely on Mars, starting a new mission to look for signs of ancient life.

Which country went to Mars?
---------------------------

USSR  
Just like exploration of the Moon, the then USSR was the first to send a mission to Mars. According to the European Space Agency (ESA) database, Marsnik 1 was launched on October 10 1960. A flyby mission, it did not reach the Earth’s Orbit.

Who was first to reach Mars?
----------------------------

While those first several missions didn’t reach their target, NASA’s Mariner 4 finally did. The spacecraft launched on Nov. 28, 1964, and was the first to fly by Mars on July 14, 1965.

How did the Rover get to the surface of Mars?
---------------------------------------------

The spacecraft includes the mechanical units that safely carry and maneuver the rover as it enters the Martian atmosphere and lands on Mars. Once on the surface, like a semi-truck carrying a racecar cross-country, it lowers a ramp to let the rover drive out.

How long does it take to drive a Mars rover?
--------------------------------------------

Terms of use. How exactly do you drive the one-ton Mars rover Curiosity, when the driver is, on average, 150 million miles away? With a one-way time delay of around 13 minutes, it certainly isn’t a matter of sitting down in front of a monitor and waggling a joystick.

Is it possible to send a rover to Mars?
---------------------------------------

The road to the launch pad is nearly as daunting as the journey to Mars. Even before the trip to Mars can begin, a craft must be built that not only can make the arduous trip but can complete its science mission once it arrives. Nothing less than exceptional technology and planning is required.

How does a spacecraft get from Earth to Mars?
---------------------------------------------

The spacecraft is the protective “spaceship” that enables the precious cargo (that is, the rover!) to travel between Earth and Mars. It is separate from the launch vehicle that carries the spacecraft and the rover outside of Earth’s atmosphere and gravity pull.
