Is the Amazon rainforest always wet?
------------------------------------

Weather in the Amazon. The Amazon Rainforest is characterized by rain, heat and more rain and heat, providing the perfect environment for plants and wildlife! The Amazon is always humid with generous amounts of rain occurring year-round. Both the rainy and “rainier” seasons are great times for an Amazon tour.

Is rainforest a wet habitat?
----------------------------

Rainforests are lush, warm, wet habitats. Trees in the rainforest grow very tall because they have to compete with other plants for sunlight.

What is the best time to go to the Amazon rainforest?
-----------------------------------------------------

In many ways, May and early June are the best time to visit the Amazon. During these months, the river levels are still high enough for exploration by boat, but the rainfall is curbing enough to draw out some of the wildlife you might not spot otherwise.

How does dry air affect the Amazon rainforest?
----------------------------------------------

In some of the wettest parts of the Amazon rainforest, dry air may increase plant photosynthesis rates — a response that contradicts the assumptions of many climate models, according to a recent study published in Science Advances. When conditions are dry, plants attempt to retain water by closing the tiny pores on their leaves called stomata.

How are tropical rainforests adapted to the wet season?
-------------------------------------------------------

At the beginning of the dry season, trees in wet tropical forests drop the leaves at the top of the canopy, allowing more light through and stimulating growth of plants in the understory. By the time the wet season arrives, the shed leaves have been replaced by young leaves that are able to photosynthesize far more efficiently.

Where is the majority of the Amazon rainforest located?
-------------------------------------------------------

Amazon rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.

Why are environmentalists concerned about the Amazon rainforest?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Amazon rainforest Environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest, and also about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation, which could accelerate global warming.
