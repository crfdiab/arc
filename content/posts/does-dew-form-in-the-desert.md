Does dew form in the desert?
----------------------------

In desert cave, microbes feed on water, rocks, air “To survive, these ecosystems recycle water in the form of fog and dew. In the driest places on the planet, even seemingly minor components of the water cycle, such as fog and dew, become major and are critical to keeping the environment alive and functioning.”

Why is there fog in the Namib Desert?
-------------------------------------

The origin of the fog over Namib Desert is considered the advection fog by the drifting of warm westerly wind over Benguela cold current which flows from the south in the Atlantic Ocean north- ward. The fog arises from early morning to before noon, and the fog is advected from the inland to the seaward.

What lives in the Namib Desert?
-------------------------------

Other fascinating desert-adapted wildlife of the Namib Desert include: Baboon, Leopard, Cheetah, Brown and Spotted Hyena, Klipspringer, Springbok, Steenbok, Cape and Bat Eared Fox, Hartmann’s Zebra, as well as many insects, reptiles, small mammals and even wild Desert Horses.

What country is the Namib Desert in?
------------------------------------

Africa: Namibia. This extremely arid ecoregion comprises shifting sand dunes, gravel plains and rugged mountains. The world’s oldest desert, the Namib Desert has existed for at least 55 million years, completely devoid of surface water but bisected by several dry riverbeds.

Can you drink dew?
------------------

Dew Collections Yields and Filtering And although it is a bit cloudy, it’s quite potable. Keep in mind that although dew is really distilled water, if you have a water filter available or at least can boil it, by all means make sure you do it.

What causes morning dew?
------------------------

Dew is the result of water changing from a vapor to a liquid. Colder air is less able to hold water vapor than warm air. This forces water vapor in the air around cooling objects to condense. When condensation happens, small water droplets form—dew.

Can animals see in fog?
-----------------------

Many birds can see through the fog as if they were wearing blue-blocker sunglasses and can easily navigate in all but the most dense of fogs. Many birds do not travel very far to search for food.

What countries have coastal deserts?
------------------------------------

Coastal deserts include the Namib Desert in southwestern Africa and Atacama Desert in Chile.

Why is Skeleton Coast so dangerous?
-----------------------------------

Skeleton Coast National Park is one of the most inhospitable places within the oldest desert on earth in Namibia. The eerie coastline has long been considered a dangerous area for naval vessels due to the persistent foggy weather and unpredictable Benguela current.

What is the oldest desert in Africa?
------------------------------------

the Namib  
Dating back at least 55 million years, the Namib is believed to be the world’s oldest desert (the Sahara is thought to be just two to seven million years old). With summer temperatures routinely reaching 45C and nights that can dip below freezing, it’s also one of the most inhospitable places on the planet.
