Are there axolotls in the rainforest?
-------------------------------------

Axolotl. The Axolotl is probably the rarest animal on this list, being restricted to only one or two populations in the rainforest rivers of Mexico. The axolotl is native only to lakes and rivers in the Valley of Mexico.

Where do axolotls come from?
----------------------------

The axolotl is native only to Lake Xochimilco in the Valley of Mexico, as well as the canals and waterways of Mexico City. Because they’re neotenic, their habitat reflects this: a high-altitude body of water. This is unique to axolotls, with other salamanders having a much wider distribution.

What did the axolotl evolve from?
---------------------------------

It is generally accepted that neoteny is a “backward” step in evolution, because the Axolotl is descended from what were once terrestrial salamanders, like the closely related species, the Tiger Salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum and Ambystoma mavortium spp.

Where are axolotls found in the wild?
-------------------------------------

Xochimilco  
Found exclusively in the lake complex of Xochimilco (pronounced SO-chee-MILL-koh) near Mexico City, axolotls differ from most other salamanders in that they live permanently in water.

Why are axolotls illegal in California?
---------------------------------------

According to California law, axolotls are not prohibited because they are endangered, but rather because they pose a threat to native wildlife, as they are seen as “detrimental animals”. This includes a ban on all salamanders, and this includes axolotls.

Are there blue axolotls in real life?
-------------------------------------

No, blue axolotls don’t exist. While many will appear like they are blue or maybe purple, they are actually dark grey or black. Some variations of axolotls might even have bright gold flecks on their skin, which, under the proper lighting conditions, will make them appear as though they are blue.

Where can you find an axolotl in the wild?
------------------------------------------

4\. Wild ones can only be found in one place. iStock. While you can find axolotls in aquariums and laboratories all over the world, it’s much harder to find them in the wild. The animals can only be found in the lakes and canals of Xochimilco, Mexico.

How is an axolotl different from other amphibians?
--------------------------------------------------

As adults, most amphibians grow legs and leave the water, but axolotls are different. An axolotl’s larval stage lasts its entire life. Even though they grow four legs, they don’t leave the water even as adults. That’s why they’re humorously called “walking fish.”

Why are the axolotls in Mexico in decline?
------------------------------------------

Populations are in decline as the demands of nearby Mexico City have led to the draining and contamination of much of the waters of the Xochimilco Lake complex. They are also popular in the aquarium trade, and roasted axolotl is considered a delicacy in Mexico, further shrinking their numbers. They are considered a critically endangered species.

Where do axolotl salamanders live in Mexico City?
-------------------------------------------------

Found exclusively in the lake complex of Xochimilco (pronounced SO-chee-MILL-koh) near Mexico City, axolotls differ from most other salamanders in that they live permanently in water.
