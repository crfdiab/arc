How does air pollution affect forest?
-------------------------------------

Air pollutants may damage forests directly via the foliage, and indirectly via the soil. The direct effects of O3, SO2, NO2, and NH3 include visible leaf dam- age, a decrease in the number of needle age classes in conifers, and elevated pollutant concentrations in plant tissues.

What types of pollution can affect the trees in the woodland?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Recently, this research has focused on understanding how acid deposition (aka acid rain), nitrogen pollution, and climate change may contribute to the declines of important tree species such as red spruce, sugar maple, and yellow-cedar.

Which is the number one cause of pollution in a forest?
-------------------------------------------------------

In fact, air pollution is considered the most important anthropogenic factor affecting forests in central and eastern Europe.

How does pollution affect the health of trees?
----------------------------------------------

Trees, like any living thing, thrive partially because of water. When the water is contaminated, it can cause serious problems. For example, contaminated water can be taken in through the roots of plants and will work its way to parts that humans will eat. This can make us sick. If the pollution is bad enough, it can end up killing a tree entirely.

What are the effects of air pollution on the environment?
---------------------------------------------------------

Not just that, there are plenty of effects of air pollution on the environment too. Air pollution caused haze or smog, which obscures colours and muffle sounds. Soil and water bodies can get contaminated which, in turn, can kill the crop and destroy young trees.

What happens to trees when water is contaminated?
-------------------------------------------------

Trees, like any living thing, thrive partially because of water. When the water is contaminated, it can cause serious problems. For example, contaminated water can be taken in through the roots of plants and will work its way to parts that humans will eat. This can make us sick.

How does cutting down trees affect the environment?
---------------------------------------------------

For instance, the average temperature in Los Angeles has risen by 6F in 50 years, and the average global temperature grew by 1.4 F. This happens as tree coverage declines. Removing trees and replacing them with heat absorbing asphalt roads and buildings makes cities much warmer.
