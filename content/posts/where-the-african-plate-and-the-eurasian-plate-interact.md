Where the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate interact?
--------------------------------------------------------

The northern part of the plate is a convergent boundary where the African plate is subducting below the Eurasian plate. Subduction zones are convergent boundaries, and where they collide, one plate dives below the other. In this case, the African plate is diving below the Eurasian plate.

Where is African Plate located?
-------------------------------

The African Plate is rifting in the eastern interior of the African continent along the East African Rift. This rift zone separates the African Plate to the west from the Somali Plate to the east.

Where is the Eurasian Plate found?
----------------------------------

The Eurasian Plate is a tectonic plate which includes most of the continent of Eurasia (a landmass consisting of the traditional continents of Europe and Asia), with the notable exceptions of the Indian subcontinent, the Arabian subcontinent, and the area east of the Chersky Range in East Siberia.

Where is the Eurasian Plate located in the world?
-------------------------------------------------

Eurasian Plate. The Eurasian Plate is a tectonic plate which includes most of the continent of Eurasia (a landmass consisting of the traditional continents of Europe and Asia), with the notable exceptions of the Indian subcontinent, the Arabian subcontinent, and the area east of the Chersky Range in East Siberia.

Where is the African plate located on the Earth?
------------------------------------------------

African Plate. The African Plate is a major tectonic plate straddling the equator as well as the prime meridian. It includes much of the continent of Africa, as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges. Between and , the Somali Plate began rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift.

Is the African Plate west of the East African Rift?
---------------------------------------------------

Tectonic plate underlying Africa west of the East African Rift. The African Plate is a major tectonic plate straddling the equator as well as the prime meridian.

Which is the third largest plate in the world?
----------------------------------------------

The Eurasian Plate is a plate tectonic boundary consisting most of Europe, Russia and China. It’s the third largest, being slightly smaller than the Pacific Plate and North American Plate. Because Earth’s tectonic plate boundaries often consist of continent and ocean crust, the Eurasian Plate contains parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean.
