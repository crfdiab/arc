What does a waning gibbous moon do?
-----------------------------------

The Waning Gibbous phase is when the lit-up part of the Moon shrinks from 99.9% to 50.1%. It starts just after Full Moon and lasts until the Third Quarter Moon. Waning means that it is shrinking and getting smaller, while gibbous refers to the oval-to-round shape.

As the illuminated side of the moon appears to be getting smaller in size (after a full moon), the moon is said to be in a “waning phase”. The moon for the next 7 days will be in a “waning gibbous phase”.

Is waning gibbous getting bigger?
---------------------------------

When the Moon appears larger than a quarter, we call it gibbous. When the moon is getting bigger (phases New to Full) it is waxing. When it is getting smaller (phases Full to New) it is waning. Following third quarter it becomes a waning crescent, and continues to shrink until it becomes invisible at new Moon.
