Why do different biomes have different plant adaptations?
---------------------------------------------------------

Plants, animals, and other organisms evolve adaptations to suit them to the abiotic factors in their biome. Abiotic factors to which they adapt include temperature, moisture, growing season, and soil. This is why the same type of biome in different parts of the world has organisms with similar adaptations.

Why do different biomes have different characteristics?
-------------------------------------------------------

Some environmental conditions affecting the location of biomes include climate, latitude, topography, and fire. Often, different species having similar, convergent growth forms will dominate at different places within the same biome.

Why are there different adaptations?
------------------------------------

An organism’s adaptations are a result of the genes the organism inherits from its parents. The proportion of well-adapted organisms in a population can increase over the generations by the process of evolution by natural selection.

How are living things adapted to their biomes?
----------------------------------------------

1\) Design a new animal at SwitchZoo. 2) Select a head, legs and tail that you think would be most beneficial to your new creature in the given biome. 3) Use this graphic organizer to keep track of your adaptations and why you chose them. The goal is to survive. The reasons are the adaptations.

Why do some biomes have lower biodiversity than others?
-------------------------------------------------------

Biomes with low precipitation, extreme temperatures, short growing seasons, and poor soil have low biodiversity — fewer kinds or amounts of plants and animals — due to less than ideal growing conditions and harsh, extreme environments.

How are behavioral adaptations different from physical adaptations?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Physical adaptations are a part of an animal’s body that helps them get what they need to survive (like sharp claws). A behavioral adaptation is something the animal does to protect itself from predators (such as growling).

Why are plants and animals limited in desert biomes?
----------------------------------------------------

Biomes with low precipitation, extreme temperatures, short growing seasons, and poor soil have low biodiversity — fewer kinds or amounts of plants and animals — due to less than ideal growing conditions and harsh, extreme environments. Because desert biomes are inhospitable to most life, plant growth is slow and animal life is limited.
