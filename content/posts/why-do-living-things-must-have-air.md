Why do living things must have air?
-----------------------------------

Air is important for living things. During respiration, a living thing takes in oxygen from the air and gives out carbon dioxide. This process gives animals and plants the energy to eat, grow, and live life!

Does every living thing need air?
---------------------------------

In order to survive, all living things need air, water, and food. Animals obtain their food from plants and other animals, which provides them with the energy they need to move and grow.

What will happen if living things do not get air?
-------------------------------------------------

If the living organism does not get the air, water, food, nutrients, or light it needs to survive then it will die. Classification of nonliving things: Nonliving things are all around us.

Why is oxygen important to living things?
-----------------------------------------

Oxygen plays a critical role in respiration, the energy-producing chemistry that drives the metabolisms of most living things. Oxygen is generated during photosynthesis by plants and many types of microbes. Plants both use oxygen (during respiration) and produce it (via photosynthesis).

What would happen if we lost oxygen for 5 seconds?
--------------------------------------------------

The ozone layer is made of oxygen. If the world lost its oxygen for five seconds, the earth would be an extremely dangerous place to live in. Due to the severe sunburn, our inner ear would explode. In between all this, the earth’s crust, which is made up of 45 per cent oxygen, would completely crumble.

Is there any living thing that doesn’t need oxygen?
---------------------------------------------------

In a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , researchers have now identified the first animal that doesn’t use oxygen to breathe: Henneguya salminicola, an 8-millimeter white parasite that infects the flesh of Chinook salmon.

What are 2 uses of oxygen?
--------------------------

Common uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.

What are 10 uses of air?
------------------------
