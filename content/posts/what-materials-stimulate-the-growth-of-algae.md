What materials stimulate the growth of algae?
---------------------------------------------

Some algal blooms are the result of an excess of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen) into waters and higher concentrations of these nutrients in water cause increased growth of algae and green plants.

Which of the following pollutants encourage the growth of algae in rivers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nitrogen and phosphorus support the growth of algae and aquatic plants, which provide food and habitat for fish, shellfish and smaller organisms that live in water. But when too much nitrogen and phosphorus enter the environment – usually from a wide range of human activities – the air and water can become polluted.

What are the algae used in water treatment?
-------------------------------------------

According to this list, many algal genera have species that grow well in water containing a high concentration of organic wastes. Green algae Chlamydomonas , Euglena , diatoms, Navicula , Synedra and blue- green algae Oscillatoria and Phormidium are emphasized to tolerate organic pollution \[12\].

What does algae grow off of?
----------------------------

Algae can grow in virtually any environment that has carbon dioxide, sunlight, minerals and enough water. The limiting factor in algae growth is often sunlight or minerals. When sunlight is limited, some kinds of algae can take in organic substances, like plant matter, as food.

Can I grow algae at home?
-------------------------

You add a little bit of micro-algae to each one, along with purified water, salt, and some algae food (which is available for purchase online), and turn on an air pump that’s connected to all the cells. The algae uses the carbon dioxide inside your house as fuel as it slowly grows.

How do you increase algae growth?
---------------------------------

In order for green algae to grow, it needs a lot of light to grow. So try increasing the time your lights are “on” by a few hours. The lights need to be “on” for at least 9 hours or longer. However be careful with leaving your light on for too long, as your Guppy fish still needs their sleep.

What type of pollution is algae?
--------------------------------

Nutrient pollution can create dead zones – areas in water with little or no oxygen – where aquatic life cannot survive. Also known as hypoxia, these areas are caused by algal blooms consuming oxygen as they die and decompose.

Can algae survive without sunlight?
-----------------------------------

No. Algae is a plant and in order for it to live it needs sunlight in order for photosynthesis to work. If no light is available the ingredients for photosynthesis aren’t there so the plant doesn’t have a food supply.

What can algae be used for in wastewater treatment?
---------------------------------------------------

Algae can be used in wastewater treatment for a range of purposes, some of which are used for the removal of coliform bacteria, reduction of both chemical and biochemical oxygen demand, removal of N and/or P, and also for the removal of heavy metals.

What happens when algae is used in hydroponics?
-----------------------------------------------

First is the precious nutrients are depleted from the system as the algae uses them itself to grow. Second, there is a severe drop in the dissolved oxygen in the system. This causes your plants to start suffocating, and means they are weaker to fight off any other pathogens.

What causes the growth of algae in water?
-----------------------------------------

1 Pollution Given the slimy, sprawling appearance of certain types of algae and the way it often settles on the water’s surface, it’s easy to assume that algae is a 2 Light Exposure and Water Movement Along with food, algae require the right amount of light to thrive. 3 Turbidity and Temperature

How are algal blooms affecting wastewater treatment plants?
-----------------------------------------------------------

When algal blooms strike, regulators strike back, drafting wastewater treatment plants into the fight. Drafted into the fight against Harmful Algal Blooms? The world’s water resources are being invaded and wastewater treatment plants are often the first to be called into service to fend off this threat.
