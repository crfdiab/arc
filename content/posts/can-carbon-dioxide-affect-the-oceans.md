Can carbon dioxide affect the oceans?
-------------------------------------

Carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels accumulates in the atmosphere, where it causes global warming. But it also affects our oceans. As carbon dioxide enters the ocean, it reacts with sea water to form carbonic acid. Changes in ocean acidity are undeniably linked to human activities.

How does an increase in carbon dioxide have a negative effect on marine animals?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rising acidity of ocean waters due to increased levels of atmospheric CO2 will have profound adverse effects on sea life, according to a new study. Riebesell and colleagues developed what they call mesocosms, which are big containers they can put out into the ocean to enclose a body of water.

How does CO2 mess with marine life?
-----------------------------------

Seawater rich in CO2 is deplete of a key building block shellfish like oysters, clams and mussels need to grow and maintain shells. This higher-CO2, more-acidic water can lead to increased mortality among these young shellfish.

Why is too much carbon dioxide in the ocean bad?
------------------------------------------------

If not for the ocean, we’d be in even worse trouble with too much CO2. The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere wherever air meets water. Wind causes waves and turbulence, giving more opportunity for the water to absorb the carbon dioxide. However, the ocean and everything in it are paying a price.

What human activities could increase the levels of carbon dioxide in our biosphere?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Burning fossil fuels, releasing chemicals into the atmosphere, reducing the amount of forest cover, and the rapid expansion of farming, development, and industrial activities are releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and changing the balance of the climate system.

What are the two ways ocean acidification affects marine life?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Ocean acidification can negatively affect marine life, causing organisms’ shells and skeletons made from calcium carbonate to dissolve. Animals that produce calcium carbonate structures have to spend extra energy either repairing their damaged shells or thickening them to survive.

How does increased levels of CO2 in our oceans could hurt and endanger our marine life?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem is that a vast number of marine organisms build their skeletons and shells from calcium carbonate. But calcium carbonate dissolves in acidic solutions! Many researchers have showed that when these organisms are exposed to high levels of CO2, they cannot build their shells/skeletons properly.

How does carbon dioxide affect the marine system?
-------------------------------------------------

In the recent climate change epidemic, the effects of carbon dioxide have been negative to many ecosystems, this includes the marine system. The changing concentration of harmful acids in the atmosphere has made oceans more acidic and the increasing levels of carbon dioxide has a detrimental effect on the planet’s biodiversity.

How is carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean?
--------------------------------------------

The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide (CO 2) that is released in the atmosphere. As levels of atmospheric CO 2 increase from human activity such as burning fossil fuels (e.g., car emissions) and changing land use (e.g., deforestation), the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean also increases.

What are the effects of increasing carbon dioxide levels?
---------------------------------------------------------

Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have caused increasing photosynthetic rates, biomass growth, and seed yield for all of the globally important C3 food and feed crops (Acock and Allen, 1985; Enoch and Kimball, 1986; Warrick et al., 1986; Allen, 1990).

How does carbon dioxide affect the pH of water?
-----------------------------------------------

Acids like carbon dioxide increase the concentration of a hydrogen ions. The pH drops when there is a higher concentration of hydrogen ions. Over time, the rapid drop of pH in surface waters gradually mixes into deep water thereby affecting the chemical composition of the seawater.
