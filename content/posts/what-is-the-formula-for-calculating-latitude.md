What is the formula for calculating latitude?
---------------------------------------------

Calculating the distance between latitude lines is easy because this distance never varies. If you treat the Earth as a sphere with a circumference of 25,000 miles, then one degree of latitude is 25,000/360 = 69.44 miles.

What is a latitude line?
------------------------

Latitude is the measurement of distance north or south of the Equator. It is measured with 180 imaginary lines that form circles around the Earth east-west, parallel to the Equator. These lines are known as parallels. A circle of latitude is an imaginary ring linking all points sharing a parallel.

How to find the latitude and longitude coordinates?
---------------------------------------------------

The degree of the angle is between -90° and 90°. longitude and latitude coordinates are usually expressed in degrees and minutes. GPS Coordinates uses Map Coordinates to find coordinates and get your current location. To find your ip address, you can use the what is my ip address tool. If you want to find out your county, use What County am I in.

How can I Find my GPS coordinates from my address?
--------------------------------------------------

GPS Coordinates Finder convert address to lat and long. Type in the address field and click on the Get GPS Coordinates button to lookup latitude and longitude from address. You will see the result on the map coordinates and in the Latitude Longitude fields.

How to find the longitude and latitude of parcel corners?
---------------------------------------------------------

You can do this from Google Maps or perhaps you have a plat map. Get a big black marker and write the longitude and latitude of each corner near that corner. Remember to write down the negative sign in front of longitude.

How is latitude and longitude divided into two parts?
-----------------------------------------------------

Latitude Longitude is divided into two parts. Latitude is the angular distance of a place north or south of the earth’s equator. The degree of the angle is between -90° and 90°. It is usually expressed in degrees and minutes.
