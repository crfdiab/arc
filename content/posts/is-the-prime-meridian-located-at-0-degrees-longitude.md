Is the prime meridian located at 0 degrees longitude?
-----------------------------------------------------

The prime meridian is the line of 0° longitude, the starting point for measuring distance both east and west around the Earth. The prime meridian is arbitrary, meaning it could be chosen to be anywhere.

What is half way around the world from the Prime Meridian?
----------------------------------------------------------

The meridian that runs through Greenwich, England, is internationally accepted as the line of 0 degrees longitude, or prime meridian. The antimeridian is halfway around the world, at 180 degrees.

Where does the prime meridian start and end?
--------------------------------------------

Prime Meridian is the fictional line from the North Pole to the South Pole going through Greenwich in England and markings 0 ° longitude from where all other distances are measured. It is the 0 ° longitudinal line, the starting point for calculating distance across the Planet to both east and west.

Which is the line of longitude opposite the prime meridian?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Lines of longitude (meridians) running north-south around the globe measure distances EAST and WEST of the Prime Meridian. Directly on the opposite side of the earth from the prime meridian is located the 180? meridian. This is the highest longitude possible. Subsequently, question is, where is the prime meridian on a globe?

Is the 180th meridian a prime meridian or an anti meridian?
-----------------------------------------------------------

For the meridian often called the Prime Meridian, see IERS Reference Meridian. A prime meridian is the meridian (a line of longitude) in a geographic coordinate system at which longitude is defined to be 0°. Together, a prime meridian and its anti-meridian (the 180th meridian in a 360°-system) form a great circle.

Is the Eastern Hemisphere east of the prime meridian?
-----------------------------------------------------

The eastern hemisphere is east of the prime meridian and west of the International Date Line. Most of Earths landmasses, including all of Asia and Australia, and most of Africa, are part of the eastern hemisphere.
