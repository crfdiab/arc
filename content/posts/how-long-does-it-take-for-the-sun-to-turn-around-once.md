How long does it take for the sun to turn around once?
------------------------------------------------------

about 365 days  
Earth is closer to the sun and revolves around it in about 365 days. Sentences: Earth revolves around the sun in 365 days, 5 hours, 59 minutes and 16 seconds. The time a planet takes to revolve around the sun is called a year.

How many times has the sun gone around the Milky Way?
-----------------------------------------------------

Based on a distance of 30,000 light years and a speed of 220 km/s, the Sun’s orbit around the center of the Milky Way once every 225 million years. The period of time is called a cosmic year. The Sun has orbited the galaxy, more than 20 times during its 5 billion year lifetime.

Does the Milky Way move?
------------------------

The Milky Way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference. The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.

Does the sun rotate around a black hole?
----------------------------------------

No, although its trajectory does take it around (at least) one black hole. The Sun, along with the rest of the hundreds of billions of stars that constitute the Milky Way, follows a complicated orbit determined by the combined gravitational field of all these stars.

Which is the closest celestial body to our sun?
-----------------------------------------------

Of the planets, Mercury is closest to the sun, followed by Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, the most distant.

How long does it take the sun to orbit the center of the Galaxy?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Even at this blazing speed, it takes the sun approximately 225-250 million years to complete one journey around the galaxy’s center. This amount of time – the time it takes us to orbit the center of the galaxy – is sometimes called a cosmic year. See a range of estimates for the length of a cosmic year here.

How long does a cosmic year take for the sun to rotate?
-------------------------------------------------------

“Cosmic Year: the time taken for one complete revolution of the Sun around the entire center of the galaxy; about 225 million years.” Kerrod, Robin. Encyclopedia of Science Heavens 2. New York: MacMillian Reference USA, 1997: 35. “The Sun takes 225 million Earth years to make one rotation. This period of time is called a cosmic year.”

How many years are in a galactic year?
--------------------------------------

The galactic year, also known as a cosmic year, is the duration of time required for the Sun to orbit once around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. One is 230 million years. \[2\]

What is the speed of the Sun in relation to the Milky Way?
----------------------------------------------------------

The speed of the solar system due to the galactic rotation is about 220 km/s. The disk of stars in the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years across and the sun is located about 30,000 light years from the galaxy’s center. Based on a distance of 30,000 light years and a speed of 220 km/s,…
