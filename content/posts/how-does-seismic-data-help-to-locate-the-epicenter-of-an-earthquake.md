How does seismic data help to locate the epicenter of an earthquake?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Scientists use triangulation to find the epicenter of an earthquake. When seismic data is collected from at least three different locations, it can be used to determine the epicenter by where it intersects. Each seismograph records the times when the first (P waves) and second (S waves) seismic waves arrive.

How are seismic waves used to measure earthquakes?
--------------------------------------------------

A seismograph produces a graph-like representation of the seismic waves it receives and records them onto a seismogram. Seismograms contain information that can be used to determine how strong an earthquake was, how long it lasted, and how far away it was.

How do scientists determine what areas are at risk for earthquakes?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The procedure is simple to state: guess a location, depth and origin time; compare the predicted arrival times of the wave from your guessed location with the observed times at each station; then move the location a little in the direction that reduces the difference between the observed and calculated times.

How are seismic waves used to study the Earth?
----------------------------------------------

Investigating the Earth’s structure using seismic waves The study of seismic waves provides evidence for the internal structure of the Earth, which cannot be observed directly. Seismic waves from large earthquakes are detected around the world using seismometers.

How are seismic waves represented in 3-D?
-----------------------------------------

In 3-D, a wave front expands outward from the earthquake focus like a growing bubble. We can represent a succession of waves in a drawing by a series of concentric wave fronts. The changing position of an imaginary point on a wave front as the front moves through rock is called a seismic ray.

How are sound waves recorded during an earthquake?
--------------------------------------------------

When they travel through air, they take the form of sound waves – they travel at the speed of sound (330 ms-1) through air but may travel at 5000 ms-1 in granite. Because of their speed, they are the first waves to be recorded by a seismograph during an earthquake.

Which is potential sources of destruction that may be caused by earthquakes?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which are potential sources of destruction that may be caused either directly or secondarily by earthquakes? An earthquake is generated at a location we call the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and releases energy in the form of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ waves. Nice work!
