What is hot latitude?
---------------------

Horse latitudes are the latitudes about 30 degrees north and south of the equator. They are characterized by sunny skies, calm winds, and very little precipitation. They are also known as subtropical ridges, or highs.

What is the warmest place on earth?
-----------------------------------

Death Valley  
Death Valley holds the record for the highest air temperature on the planet: On 10 July 1913, temperatures at the aptly named Furnace Creek area in the California desert reached a blistering 56.7°C (134.1°F).

How do lines of latitude relate to hot climates?
------------------------------------------------

Latitude has a big effect on climate because latitude controls how much solar energy a location receives. The tropics, which are places on or near the equator, are warm all year long because they get about the same amount of sunlight during the year.

Where are the latitude lines on the Earth?
------------------------------------------

Latitude are lines that encircle the Earth in an east to west fashion, starting with the equator (0 degrees) and go either the North Pole (90 degrees) or the South Pole (-90 degrees).

Which is the farthest south line of latitude?
---------------------------------------------

This line is the point farthest to the north at which the sun is hanging directly upward at noon. The Tropic of Capricorn is located at approximately 23.5 degrees south latitude, or 23.5 degrees south of the equator. This line of latitude is the southern boundary of the area referred to as the tropics.

Which is the greatest possible latitude and longitude?
------------------------------------------------------

Thus, a point at 30°15′20″ N subtends an angle of 30°15′20″at the centre of the globe; similarly, the arc between the Equator and either geographic pole is 90° (one-fourth the circumference of Earth, or 1 / 4 × 360°), and thus the greatest possible latitudes are 90° N and 90° S.

Which is the northernmost line of latitude in the tropics?
----------------------------------------------------------

This line of latitude is the northern boundary of the area referred to as the tropics. During the summer solstice the sun is located immediately above the Tropic of Cancer. This line is the point farthest to the north at which the sun is hanging directly upward at noon.
