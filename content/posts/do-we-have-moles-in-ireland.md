Do we have moles in Ireland?
----------------------------

A customer found the mole repellent on sale in B&amp;Q’s Derry store, despite the fact that moles don’t exist in Ireland. This phenomenon occurred as a result of the last ice age which ended about 7,000 years ago. They moved through Europe and into Britain, but did not reach Ireland because the sea level rose too quickly.

How many moles are there in Ireland?
------------------------------------

‘Sea level rose’ Professor Ian Montgomery from Queen’s University said there were no moles at all in Ireland. “The origin of the Irish mammal fauna is very interesting because the major process is one of glaciation,” he said.

Are moles native to Britain?
----------------------------

Origin &amp; Distribution: Moles are found throughout Britain but not in Ireland. They are present in most habitats where the soil is deep enough to allow tunnelling but are uncommon in coniferous forests, on moorlands and in sand dunes, probably because their prey is scarce.

Are there bears in Ireland?
---------------------------

Brown bears are back in the wild again in Ireland along with three wolves, a lynx and some monkeys. The three bears, two sisters and their brother, came from a private zoo in Lithuania where they were living in a concrete cell with iron bars. Mr McLaughlin said the brown bears are the only ones currently in Ireland.

Why do moles have no eyes?
--------------------------

In moles, PAX6 stays on too long and loses its tight grasp on the genome. This causes a breakdown in the choreography of eye cell development. Although their eyelids stay closed, the skin is thin enough to let some light shine through.

What is a natural predator of moles?
------------------------------------

Both gophers and moles share several natural enemies, such as snakes, weasels, coyotes, badgers, hawks, and owls. Domestic dogs and cats may join in the chase near homes and farmsteads. But these natural predators can only slow down the rate of population increase, especially if other survival factors are favorable.
