Biology is the study of life. The word “biology” is derived from the Greek words “bios” (meaning life) and “logos” (meaning “study”). In general, biologists study the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution and distribution of living organisms.

What is the study of the interactions of living things called?
--------------------------------------------------------------

A. The study of interactions among organisms and their environment is called ecology.

What is the study of interactions of living and non living things?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Ecology is the study of the interactions among living things and between living things and their surroundings.

What are the characteristics of living systems?
-----------------------------------------------

Despite the huge variation among all forms of life, there are certain common characteristics that enable life to exist, and even thrive. We have defined these five characteristics as: compartmentalization, growth and division, information processing, energy transduction and adaptability (figure 1).

Is the study of living and nonliving things?
--------------------------------------------

Ecology is the study of the interactions of living things with each other and with the nonliving environment.

Which is the study of interactions between living organisms?
------------------------------------------------------------

Ecology is the study of interactions among organisms and their environment.

How are living organisms related to their environment?
------------------------------------------------------

The study of ecosystems seeks to understand the manner in which species are distributed in nature and how they are influenced by their abiotic and biotic interactions, e.g., species interactions. Interactions between living organisms and their environments result in the movement of matter and energy.

How do organisms interact with nonliving components of ecosystems?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Every day as we live our lives, we are exposed to the many ways that organisms interact with both the living and nonliving components of ecosystems.
