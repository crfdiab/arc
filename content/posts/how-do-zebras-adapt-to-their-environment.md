How do zebras adapt to their environment?
-----------------------------------------

Zebra have adapted to their habitats in several ways. These include adaptations in their anatomy, physiology and even their behavior. Some adaptations serve to discourage predators and parasites. These adaptations range from the obvious, like their stripes, to more subtle adaptions, like their herding behavior.

How do the animals in the savanna adapt?
----------------------------------------

Animals adapt to the shortage of water and food through various ways, including migrating (moving to another area) and hibernating until the season is over. Grazing animals, like gazelles and zebras, feed on grasses and often use camouflage to protect themselves from predators when they are roaming in the open.

What are Dolphins adaptations?

One of the most important adaptations of dolphins is their ability to use echolocation to learn about their surroundings. By making high-pitched squeaks, grunts and clicks, the dolphins can listen for the sound waves bouncing off objects around them.

What is the most common animal in the savanna?

What are two adaptations of dolphins?
-------------------------------------

Lesson Summary Physical adaptations include a blowhole located at the top of the body, which allows a dolphin to come up to the surface, easily take in air, and continue swimming. While asleep, half of a dolphin’s brain remains awake. The active half signals when it’s time for the dolphin to surface and take in air.

Do dolphins have a sixth sense?
-------------------------------

Dolphins have a sixth sense that we are missing: echolocation. They produce sounds in their nasal cavities that are sent out through the melon, their fat-filled forehead. These sounds bounce off an object and return as an echo to the animal through its fat-filled jaw.

How are giraffe adapted to eat their food?

Their very long necks are an adaption to feeding at high levels in the treetops. Their physical adaption, a long neck, does not only help them to graze but also helps them keep track of predators and it enables visual communication with other giraffe over several miles.

Why are zebras important to the Savanna biome?
----------------------------------------------
