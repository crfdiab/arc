What process occurs when an earthquake shaking?
-----------------------------------------------

When an earthquake occurs, the elastic energy is released and sends out vibrations that travel in all directions throughout the Earth. These vibrations are called seismic waves. The point within the earth where the fault rupture starts is called the focus or hypocenter.

Which term is defined as turning loose soil into liquid mud by the vibrations of an earthquake?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Liquefaction. occurs when an earthquake’s violent shaking suddenly turns loose soft soil into liquid mud.

What happens when a quake hits an area with loose soil?
-------------------------------------------------------

Part of the damage is the effect of liquefaction, which causes soil to lose its ability to support structures. This is what liquefaction looks like. It happens when a quake strikes an area with loose, moist soil that’s been shaken violently. The soil behaves like a liquid, with frightening results.

How do you fix soil liquefaction?
---------------------------------

Mitigation methods have been devised by earthquake engineers and include various soil compaction techniques such as vibro compaction (compaction of the soil by depth vibrators), dynamic compaction, and vibro stone columns. These methods densify soil and enable buildings to avoid soil liquefaction.

What occurs when an earthquake turns soil into liquid mud?
----------------------------------------------------------

Liquefaction is the process by which mud behaves like a liquid during an earthquake. Occurs when an earthquake turns soil into liquid mud? This process is known as liquifaction, and converts the soil/water mis into a fluid. When the external exciting force is removed, the components revert to their natural states of rest.

What happens to saturated soil in an earthquake?
------------------------------------------------

Earthquake shaking that turns solid water saturated soil to liquid mud is called “liquefaction”.However no amount of earthquake shaking can turn loose dry soil or even loose damp soil to liquid mud, the soil must already be water saturated to undergo liquefaction. Solid water saturated soil is never loose, it is typically as hard as concrete!

What happens to the ground during an earthquake?
------------------------------------------------

In the image above, some buildings toppled when the soil underwent liquefaction. Buildings can even sink into the ground if soil liquefaction occurs. Flooding can come from many sources such as broken water main pipes, dams that fail due to the earthquake and earthquake-generated tsunamis.

Which is more destructive an earthquake or ground rupture?
----------------------------------------------------------

When an earthquake event occurs, ground rupture is only where the fault zone moves. Those constructions built adjacent to the fault will survive while structures built across these zones will collapse. Avalanches, landslides, slumps and rock slides are triggered by ground shaking. These landslides are often more destructive than the earthquakes.
