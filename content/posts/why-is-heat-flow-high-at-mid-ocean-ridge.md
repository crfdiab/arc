Why is heat flow high at mid-ocean ridge?
-----------------------------------------

This asthenospheric mantle upwells into the void formed by diverging plates. As the source of this material is deeper within the Earth it is much warmer, thus produces a signature of high heat flow.

What causes the thermal-energy to be higher along the ridge?
------------------------------------------------------------

Why are thermal energy measurements greater closer to the ridge? The magma/lava along the ridge causes the thermal energy to be higher here than farther away from the ridge.

What rises from a mid-ocean ridge and where does it come from?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Mid-ocean ridges occur along divergent plate boundaries, where new ocean floor is created as the Earth’s tectonic plates spread apart. As the plates separate, molten rock rises to the seafloor, producing enormous volcanic eruptions of basalt.

What material flows out of the mid-ocean ridge?
-----------------------------------------------

Beneath a typical mid-ocean ridge, mantle material partially melts as it rises in response to reduced pressure. This melted rock, or “magma”, may collect in a reservoir a few kilometers below the seafloor, awaiting eruption.

What contributes to high thermal-energy flow readings near the center of a mid-ocean ridge?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What contributes to the high thermal-energy-flow readings near the center of a mid-ocean ridge? The older oceanic crust folds into the mid-ocean ridge.

How fast is the mid-ocean ridge expanding?
------------------------------------------

fast spreading center mid-ocean ridge where seafloor spreading is occuring at more than 100 millimeters (4 inches) a year.

Why is heat flow over a mid-ocean ridge higher?
-----------------------------------------------

Old, cold oceanic crust reaches a threshold of density at which point it begins to subduct beneath the less dense, warmer continental crust. Now we will consider mid-ocean ridges. At mid-ocean ridges two oceanic plates are diverging from one another.

How did the mid ocean ridge get its name?
-----------------------------------------

The first discovered mid-ocean ridge was the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is a spreading center that bisects the North and South Atlantic basins; hence the origin of the name ‘mid-ocean ridge’. Most oceanic spreading centers are not in the middle of their hosting ocean basis but regardless, are traditionally called mid-ocean ridges.

How is oceanic lithosphere formed at mid ocean ridge?
-----------------------------------------------------

Oceanic lithosphere is formed at an oceanic ridge, while the lithosphere is subducted back into the asthenosphere at ocean trenches. Two processes, ridge-push and slab pull, are thought to be responsible for spreading at mid-ocean ridges.

Why is the heat flow over oceanic trenches so low?
--------------------------------------------------

This is why the heat flow over oceanic trenches is so low. Interestingly, it is for this reason that subduction occurs in the first place. Old, cold oceanic crust reaches a threshold of density at which point it begins to subduct beneath the less dense, warmer continental crust.
