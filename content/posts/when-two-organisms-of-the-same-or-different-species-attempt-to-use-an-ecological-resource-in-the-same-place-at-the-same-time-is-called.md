When two organisms of the same or different species attempt to use an ecological resource in the same place at the same time is called?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition  
Competition occurs when organisms of the same or different species attempt to use an ecological resource in the same place at the same time.

What is it called when two species use the same resource in an ecosystem?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In interspecific competition, members of two different species use the same limited resource and therefore compete for it. Species compete when they have overlapping niches, that is, overlapping ecological roles and requirements for survival and reproduction.

What is an interaction in which different species attempt to use the same resource?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition. Competition is the relationship between two species (or individuals) in which both species (or individuals) attempt to use the same limited resource such that both are negatively affected by the relationship.

Which symbiosis benefits both species?
--------------------------------------

Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit. Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other is not affected. Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which the parasitic species benefits while the host species is harmed.

What is the number and variety of living organisms?
---------------------------------------------------

Biodiversity refers to the variety of living species on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi.

Why is carrying capacity important in ecosystems?
-------------------------------------------------

When an ideal population is at equilibrium with the carrying capacity of its environment, the birth and death rates are equal, and size of the population does not change. Populations larger than the carrying capacity are not sustainable, and will degrade their habitat.

Which is an example of an ecological interaction?
-------------------------------------------------

Ecological Interactions between organisms A.Competition—when two organisms of the same or different species attempt to use an ecological resource in the same place at the same time. Ex: food, water, shelter 19.

What do you mean by niche in ecology?
-------------------------------------

Niche—the ecological niche involves both the place where an organism lives and the roles that an organism has in its habitat.

How does mutualism and parasitism work in an ecosystem?
-------------------------------------------------------

Mutualism Both species benefit from the relationship. Commensalism One member of the association benefits, and the other is neither helped nor harmed. Parasitism One organism lives on or inside another organism and harms it.
