What kind of volcano formed Crater Lake?
----------------------------------------

Having a maximum depth of 594 m (1,949 ft), Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States. Mount Mazama straddles the Cascade volcanic axis and is a cluster of overlapping stratovolcanoes that is the most voluminous Quaternary volcanic system in the Oregon Cascades.

Was Crater Lake formed by a meteor?
-----------------------------------

An impact crater lake is a lake inside a depression caused by the impact of a meteor. It is also known as an annular lake in cases where the water body is shaped like a ring, as many impact crater lakes are.

What period did Crater Lake form?
---------------------------------

about 7,700 years ago  
Crater Lake today is the nation’s deepest lake. What Will Happen Next? \] deep caldera, a depression formed by collapse of ancestral Mount Mazama during the violent eruption of 50 cubic kilometers of magma, or molten rock, about 7,700 years ago…

How did Crater Lake form and what is a caldera?
-----------------------------------------------

Crater Lake is actually not a crater at all. It is a caldera, formed from the collapse of a volcano’s magma chamber. The volcano that created the caldera, Mount Mazama, erupted about 7,000 years ago. The caldera filled with rain and snow, forming a lake.

Is there cell phone service at Crater Lake?
-------------------------------------------

Crater Lake National Park Travel Tips There is little to no cell phone reception in the park. Seasonally gas is available at the Mazama Village Store but the rest of the year the closest gas is about 33 miles outside the park.

How did the crater lake get its name?
-------------------------------------

Despite its name, Crater Lake is not a crater, but a caldera. Both are formed as a result of volcanic activity; however, the former is created by an outward explosion of rock and other materials, while the latter is a deep basin formed by the inward collapse of the magma chamber.

How are crater lakes formed in a volcano?
-----------------------------------------

Lakes in calderas fill large craters formed by the collapse of a volcano during an eruption. Lakes in maars fill medium-sized craters where an eruption deposited debris around a vent. Crater lakes form as the created depression, within the crater rim, is filled by water.

When did Mount Mazama erupt crater lake formed?
