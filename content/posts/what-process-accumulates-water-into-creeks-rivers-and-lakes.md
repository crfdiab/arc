What process accumulates water into creeks rivers and lakes?
------------------------------------------------------------

During precipitation, water falls from clouds to the earth as rain, snow, hail, or sleet. After it falls, the accumulation stage begins and the water flows to creeks, storm drains, rivers, lakes, and oceans. Some of the water percolates into the soil and accumulates underground in aquifers.

What causes accumulation in the water cycle?
--------------------------------------------

Accumulation is the process of water collecting in rivers, lakes, streams, oceans and other bodies of water. When water condenses and precipitates, it eventually runs off of surfaces and collects again in bodies of water. From there, the water evaporates, and the cycle begins again.

Where does Accumulation go in the water cycle?
----------------------------------------------

Oceans are the largest water accumulations because they hold 97 percent of the Earth’s water. Accumulation can also be groundwater, which is water that goes into the Earth’s surface, and is absorbed by roots to help plants grow. As the Sun shines on accumulated water, the water heats up and turns into water vapour.

Where does a large river get its water from?
--------------------------------------------

Rivers receive water from rain and melting snow, from underground springs and aquifers, and from lakes. A large river is usually fed by tributaries (smaller rivers and streams), and so increases in size as it travels from its source, or origin. Its final destination may be an ocean, a lake, or sometimes open land,…

What happens when water flows down a river?
-------------------------------------------

Its final destination may be an ocean, a lake, or sometimes open land, where the water simply evaporates. This phenomenon usually happens only with small rivers or streams. As water flows down a river, it carries with it grains of soil, sand, and, where there is a strong current, small stones and other debris.

How are lakes and rivers used in the water cycle?
-------------------------------------------------

Inflows to these water bodies will be from precipitation, overland runoff, groundwater seepage, and tributary inflows. Outflows from lakes and rivers include evaporation, movement of water into groundwater, and withdrawals by people. Humans get into the act also, as people make great use of surface water for their needs.

How are rivers and streams different from lakes?
------------------------------------------------

Rivers and streams, unlike lakes, consist of flowing water. Perennial rivers and streams flow continuously, although the volume may vary with runoff conditions. Intermittent, or ephemeral, rivers and streams stop flowing for some period, usually because of dry conditions.
