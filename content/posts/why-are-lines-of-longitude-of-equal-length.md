Why are lines of longitude of equal length?
-------------------------------------------

They are of equal length because each line of longitude equals half of the circumference of the Earth because each extends from the North Pole to the South Pole.

Are parallels equal in length?
------------------------------

Length of all the parallels is equal – False A network of intersection lines is drawn to fix the positions of multiple functions. The grid has a series of horizontal &amp; vertical lines that are known as latitude parallels &amp; length meridians.

Is latitude a length?
---------------------

The length of a degree of arc of latitude is approximately 111 km (69 miles), varying, because of the nonuniformity of Earth’s curvature, from 110.567 km (68.706 miles) at the Equator to 111.699 km (69.41 miles) at the poles. Geographic latitude is also given in degrees, minutes, and seconds.

Are meridians equal in length?
------------------------------

Imaginary lines running from north to south are called meridians or lines of longitude. Important features of meridians: All meridians are of the same length. The maximum distance between any two meridians is at the Equator.

Is the longest parallel?
------------------------

The Equator is at 0°, and the North Pole and South Pole are at 90° north and 90° south, respectively. The Equator is the longest circle of latitude and is the only circle of latitude which also is a great circle….Other notable parallels.

Are there lines of latitude that are the same length?
-----------------------------------------------------

The lines of latitude are not all equal in length. Since they are each complete circles that remain equidistant from each other, the lines of latitude vary in size from the longest at the equator to the smallest, which are just single points, at the North and South Poles.

Are there lines of latitude above and below the equator?
--------------------------------------------------------

Both the north pole and south pole are at 90 degrees with respect to the equator. So, when you count all of the lines of the latitude above and below the equator. What you get are 180 parallels. And, when you add the equator i.e at 0 degrees, you get 181 degrees of latitudes.

Why do we need lines of latitude on a map?
------------------------------------------

On the map of the world, we see some imaginary circular lines that run from east to west. These lines are nothing but the lines of latitude. The main purpose of these circles of latitude is to help us to navigate around the globe. One can also say that we need them to fix our position with respect to the surface of the earth.

How are the parallels of latitude measured in degrees?
------------------------------------------------------

As you already know that all the parallels of latitude are usually measured in degrees. Well, speaking of degrees, the very first circles of latitude start from the equator which is at 0 degrees. Later, from the equator, these circles expand to the north and south poles of the earth.
