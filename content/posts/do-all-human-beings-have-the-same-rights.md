Do all human beings have the same rights?
-----------------------------------------

Human rights are rights we have simply because we exist as human beings – they are not granted by any state. These universal rights are inherent to us all, regardless of nationality, sex, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, language, or any other status.

How do we ensure human rights for all?
--------------------------------------

6 Ways to Protect &amp; Support Human Rights for People Around the World

1. Speak up for what you care about.
2. Volunteer or donate to a global organization.
3. Choose fair trade &amp; ethically made gifts.
4. Listen to others’ stories.
5. Stay connected with social movements.
6. Stand up against discrimination.

What are our human born rights do all people have the same rights?
------------------------------------------------------------------

“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.” I have the freedom to love, and be loved, and to exercise my right to equality, shelter, food, medical care, a cultural life and expression.

What rights does every human have?
----------------------------------

Human rights include the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work and education, and many more. Everyone is entitled to these rights, without discrimination.

How are all human beings entitled to the same rights?
-----------------------------------------------------

Article one declares that “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights…”, \[3\] this article entitles us to equality, freedom and conscience. This is backed by the second article, which begins “Everyone is entitled to all the rights…set forth in this declaration…”

How does equality underpins our human rights?
---------------------------------------------

There have been huge numbers of cases where challenges on the basis of human rights have furthered equality – ensuring that openly gay people can serve in the armed forces; that people aren’t discriminated at work on the basis of nationality; or that transgender people have the same employment, social security, and marriage rights as anyone else.

What does the Declaration of Human Rights say about equality?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Equality pops up all the time when we talk about human rights. In fact, the very first article of the UN Declaration of Human Rights states that “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.” Everybody has an idea of what equality means. It’s the state of being equal in status, rights, or opportunities.

Is it okay to give all citizens the same rights?
------------------------------------------------

However giving all citizens exactly the same rights and equal claim to them will only result in the idea of equality turning in on itself as it will bring about class divisions making some citizens ‘second-class’, thus claims for special rights for groups that would otherwise become second or even third class citizens is fully justifiable.
