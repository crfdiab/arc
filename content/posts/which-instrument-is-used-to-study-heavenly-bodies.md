Which instrument is used to study heavenly bodies?
--------------------------------------------------

telescope  
A telescope is an optical instrument designed to make distant objects like stars, planets, appear nearer, containing an arrangement of lenses, or of curved mirrors and lenses, by which rays of light are collected and focused and the resulting image magnified.

What other instruments besides telescopes are used to study space?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Astronomical instruments include:

- Alidade.
- Armillary sphere.
- Astrarium.
- Astrolabe.
- Astronomical clock.
- the Antikythera mechanism, an astronomical clock.
- Blink comparator.
- Bolometer.

Who used telescope to study the heavenly bodies?
------------------------------------------------

Galileo and the Telescope. The invention of the telescope played an important role in advancing our understanding of Earth’s place in the cosmos. While there is evidence that the principals of telescopes were known in the late 16th century, the first telescopes were created in the Netherlands in 1608.

What tools can be used to see galaxies?
---------------------------------------

If you want to observe galaxies — and I mean really get something out of the time you put in at the eyepiece — you have to use a telescope with an aperture of 8 inches or more. Bode’s Galaxy (M81) glows brightly enough to show up through binoculars, but the larger the telescope you can point at it, the better.

How is astronomy related to the study of heavenly bodies?
---------------------------------------------------------

Historically, astronomy has focused on observations of heavenly bodies. It is a close cousin to astrophysics. Succinctly put, astrophysics involves the study of the physics of astronomy and concentrates on the behavior, properties and motion of objects out there. What was ‘Kamagata Maru’? Kindly mention the details of the error here…

What are some of the heavenly bodies in space?
----------------------------------------------

Natural objects found outside of the Earth’s atmosphere, such as planets, stars, moons, comets, meteors and asteroids, are some of the heavenly bodies in space.

What makes a heavenly body a celestial body?
--------------------------------------------

Heavenly bodies are anything that are in the observable universe, bound together by gravity and are associated with their own positions in space. They are also called astronomical or celestial bodies, with celestial meaning “an inhabitant of heaven.”

What are the different types of heavenly bodies?
------------------------------------------------

Heavenly bodies are the things that make up the universe, such as stars, planets and smaller objects. Within these categories are many different variations instead of one single type. Stars include small red dwarfs, even smaller neutron stars, and stars larger than the Earth’s Sun.
