Can you breed different species together?
-----------------------------------------

When two different species successfully mate, the resulting offspring is called a hybrid. Hybrids are often, but not always, sterile (think of mules).

Can a dog and a fox mate?
-------------------------

Can foxes and dogs make babies? Short answer: no, they can’t. They simply don’t have compatible parts. Foxes and dogs diverged (that is, veered off from their common ancestor and became separate species) over 7 million years ago, and have evolved into very different creatures that cannot cross-breed.

Can a human and a pig mate?
---------------------------

Human cells can combine with pig cells. When piglets were injected in utero with human stem cells, researchers investigating the resulting animals detected the presence of cells containing the DNA of both humans and pigs (Ogle et al. 2004).

Can a cat mate with a lion?
---------------------------

However, the big cats are remarkable for the degree to which they can successfully interbreed with each other in captivity. Live young have been produced from the crossing of lion with tiger, lion with leopard, and jaguar with leopard. The appearances of these hybrids vary.

Can a dog mate with cat?
------------------------

Can dogs and cats mate? No, cats and dogs are too different to mate and produce offspring. Even though different species sometimes can produce hybrids (like lions and tigers) they have to be very closely related and it just isn’t possible in the case of cats and dogs.

Is it possible for animals of the same genus to reproduce?
----------------------------------------------------------

The answer is yes, not in all genera, but it is possible. The offspring is (usually, few exceptions) sterile, mostly attributed to the fact that they didn’t have the same number of chromosomes.

Can you have two organisms in the same genus?
---------------------------------------------

Two organisms from the same genus may produce fertile offsprings. But two organisms from two different genera cannot produce offsprings that are capable of reproduction. When writing the scientific names of organisms it begins with the Genus name, with the first letter of the Genus name capitalized followed by a period.

Which is larger a species or a genus?
-------------------------------------

In contrast, a species is the largest group of organisms whose subspecies can breed and produce offspring capable of reproduction as well. Organisms from separate species under a specific genus may or may not be able to reproduce fertile offspring. A genus ranks just above the species in an organism’s taxonomic hierarchy.

Can you breed two animals of the same species?
----------------------------------------------

Some examples are the liger and tigons (cross between lions and tigers), the hinny (female donkey, male horse) or the ursid hybrid (grizzly and polar bear) Yes, as long as they are the same species. They might be able to breed if the two species have recently separated, but more often two separate species within the same genus can’t interbreed
