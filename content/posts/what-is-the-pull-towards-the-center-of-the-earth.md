What is the pull towards the center of the Earth?
-------------------------------------------------

Gravity  
Gravity is the force that pulls all objects in the universe toward each other. On Earth, gravity pulls all objects “downward” toward the center of the planet.

Why does gravity pull towards the center of the Earth?
------------------------------------------------------

The only gravity strong enough for us to feel comes from the Earth’s mass, which is why we feel a downward pull on the surface. At the center of the Earth, the situation is different. Because Earth is nearly spherical, the gravitational forces from all the surrounding mass counteract one another.

What happens to acceleration as you fall toward the center of the Earth?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you jumped into a shaft that went all the way through the Earth, you would fall toward the center of the Earth but the rate of acceleration would decrease as you got closer to the center. (You’d still keep moving faster as you moved closer to the center but wouldn’t get faster at the same rate.)

Is there no gravity in the center of the Earth?
-----------------------------------------------

If you are at the center of the earth, gravity is zero because all the mass around you is pulling “up” (every direction there is up!).

What is the only factor that is constant for bodies falling in a vacuum?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

gravitational force  
An object that falls through a vacuum is subjected to only one external force, the gravitational force, expressed as the weight of the object. An object that is moving only because of the action of gravity is said to be free falling and its motion is described by Newton’s second law of motion.

How does gravity pull things down to Earth?
-------------------------------------------

But that’s not the only thing that’s happening: the gravity of the football is also pulling on the Earth. The thing is, the Earth is very heavy – much heavier than the football – so it’s unaffected by the pull of the football, while the football itself is pulled back down to Earth.

Why do you feel a pull toward the Earth?
----------------------------------------

The reason you do notice a pull toward the Earth is that there’s a lot of Earth to do the pulling; around 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times the mass of the person next to you. Sure it’s farther away (around 4,000 miles on average), but there’s a lot of it. Heck, it blocks half the sky (the lower half).

Where does gravity pull things toward the center of mass?
---------------------------------------------------------

Gravity does not, in general, point toward the center of mass. Take for example the Earth-Moon system. Despite its non-contiguous-ness, it’s still a perfectly legit collection of mass. The center of mass of the Earth and Moon combined is a point just a little below the Earth’s surface.

How is the gravitational pull of the earth related to time of fall?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When an object is dropped from a particular altitude, it accelerates downward based on the earth’s gravitational pull. In fact, the value of this acceleration is our old friend 9.8. If we neglect the friction of air, it is very easy to calculate the time of fall.
