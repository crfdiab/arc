Is a rain forest a living thing?
--------------------------------

Rainforests are Earth’s oldest living ecosystems, with some surviving in their present form for at least 70 million years. They are incredibly diverse and complex, home to more than half of the world’s plant and animal species—even though they cover just 6% of Earth’s surface.

What do rain forests mean for humans?
-------------------------------------

Rainforests are essential to life on Earth. Not only do they provide air, water, medicine, food, and shelter to a multitude of living beings, they are also one of our best natural defenses against climate change because of their capacity to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.

How long can some pine trees live in the Tasmanian tropical rainforest?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

aspleniifolius has been recorded to 750 years of age and Athrotaxis selaginoides (Pencil Pine) to 2000 years. Lagarostrobos franklinii (Huon Pine) is another long-lived rainforest species with a known maximum age in excess of 2000 yr (Tasmanian Parks &amp; Wildlife Service, http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/veg/pines.html).

Why are rain forests full of life?
----------------------------------

Rainforests have an abundance of plants and animals for the following reasons: Climate: because rainforests are located in tropical regions, they receive a lot of sunlight. This energy is stored in plant vegetation, which is eaten by animals. The abundance of energy supports an abundance of plant and animal species.

What does not live in the forest?
---------------------------------

Nonliving things in a forest include: rocks. water and rain. sunlight.

How do humans survive in the tropical rainforest?
-------------------------------------------------

Forest people also drink less water because their food contains a lot of water. They know how to use thousands of edible, medicinal, and poisonous plants and how to grow crops in the forest’s poor soil. They also know how to hunt and fish without driving the animals to extinction.

What is the main threat to the Tasmanian rainforest today?
----------------------------------------------------------

Logging, mining, and off-road vehicle recreation are all threats outside the World Heritage Site and fire is the biggest threat throughout the region. Fires eliminate rainforest, replacing it with mixed forest and scrub.

What are the different types of rainforests in Tasmania?
--------------------------------------------------------

The limited number of woody species is thought to be due to repeated glaciation. Tasmanian cool temperate rainforest can be divided into four types: Callidendrous rainforest, Thamnic rainforest, Implicate rainforest and Open Montane.

What kind of environment is found in Tasmania?
----------------------------------------------

Tasmania’s environment is thought similar to that once found on Gondwana. The temperate rainforest shows affinities to the present day flora of New Zealand and South America. Species of Nothofagus, Pseudopanax, Caltha, Aristotelia, Coprosma, and Orities demonstrate Tasmania’s Gondwanan heritage (Read 1999).

Are there any animals that only live in Tasmania?
-------------------------------------------------

There are animals that only live in Tasmania. The Tasmanian Devil is an example of one of the creatures that only live in Tasmania. Another example that only lives in Tasmania is a wombat. The only plants that live in Tasmania are Leatherwood, Native Laurel, and the Native plum.
