How big is the Moon compared to the sun?
----------------------------------------

Bottom line: The sun’s diameter is about 400 times larger than that of the moon – and the sun is also about 400 times farther from Earth. So the sun and moon appear nearly the same size as seen from Earth.

How big is the Moon compared to the US?
---------------------------------------

Our Moon’s diameter is more than a quarter of Earth’s diameter, while its mass is 1/81 that of Earth’s. It basically weighs 80 times less than our Earth. The Moon’s radius is only 27% of our Earth’s radius. If our Earth were hollow, it would take around 50 Moons to fill it.

Is the Moon 1/6 The mass of Earth?
----------------------------------

The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Moon is approximately 1.625 m/s2, about 16.6% that on Earth’s surface or 0.166 ɡ. Because weight is directly dependent upon gravitational acceleration, things on the Moon will weigh only 16.6% (= 1/6) of what they weigh on the Earth.

Is 1 6 on the Moon weight or mass?
----------------------------------

Since the Moon is smaller than Earth, it has a weaker gravitational pull. In fact, the Moon only has 1/6 the gravity that Earth does. This means you weigh six times less on the Moon than you do on Earth!

How is the mass of the Moon compared to the Earth?
--------------------------------------------------

The ratio of gravitational pull of earth on moon to that of moon on earth will be : &gt; • The mass of the moon is 1… • The mass of the moon is 1% of mass of the earth. The ratio of gravitational pull of earth on moon to that of moon on earth will be :

What is the ratio size of the Sun and the Moon?
-----------------------------------------------

Earth moon distance 384 400 KM. The ratio comes to about 389..1 DIIAMETER OF sUN 1391400KM daimeter of Moon 3475KM ratio=400. THat is why during total eclipse Moon covers sun’s disk for several seconds.

What is the volume of the Moon?
-------------------------------

The volume of the Moon is 21.9 billion cubic km. Again, that sounds like a huge number, but the volume of the Earth is more like 1 trillion cubic kilometers. So the volume of the Moon is only 2% compared to the volume of the Earth. Finally, let’s take a look at mass.

Why does the Moon look bigger at the horizon?
---------------------------------------------

One alternative hypothesis holds that the moon seems larger near the horizon because we can compare its size to nearby trees and other objects on Earth — and it looms large in comparison. Overhead, amid the vast expanse of outer space, the moon seems diminutive.
