How can we reduce tropical cyclones?
------------------------------------

Be sure trees and shrubs around your home are well trimmed so they are more wind resistant. Clear loose and clogged rain gutters and downspouts. Reinforce your garage doors; if wind enters a garage it can cause dangerous and expensive structural damage.

How can we prevent cyclones from happening?
-------------------------------------------

Planting trees to prevent cyclone damage. This reduces the frontal gust damage by deflecting and redirecting wind. Reduce the height of taller trees – a group of trees and tall shrubs together (of equal height) can divert wind through funneling.

Is there a way to stop a tropical cyclone?
------------------------------------------

The core of the idea remains the same: mixing the warm surface waters that fuel tropical cyclones with cooler waters below to drain storms of their energy. But now Stephen Salter an emeritus professor of engineering design at the University of Edinburgh proposes a new—and possibly more realistic—method of mixing.

How to prepare for a hurricane or tropical cyclone?
---------------------------------------------------

1\. Determine your risk for wind and water hazards, and prepare for how you will handle them. Hurricanes are not just a coastal problem; their impacts can be felt many miles inland. Storms such as Irma and Maria serve as reminders that major damage and disruption can be inflicted even when we are not directly impacted. 2.

What can you do to help the victims of Cyclone Idai?
----------------------------------------------------

Here are four things you can do to help the victims of Cyclone Idai. 1. Donate to organizations on the ground. In the days leading up to the cyclone, relief organizations sent workers to Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe to be prepared for the impending storm and the potential consequences.

What can be done to reduce the frequency of hurricanes?
-------------------------------------------------------

Biological productivity could be side benefit. By mixing warm sea-surface water with the colder water beneath year-round, Salter thinks these pumps could keep the surface temperature below the 26.5 degrees Celsius threshold, beyond which the frequency and severity of hurricanes increase markedly.
