Pacific Ocean  
The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest ocean basin on Earth, covering more than 155 million square kilometers (60 million square miles) and averaging a depth of 4,000 meters (13,000 feet).

Is the Atlantic the shallowest ocean?

Which is the second largest ocean in the world?
-----------------------------------------------

Atlantic Ocean: After the Pacific, the Atlantic Ocean comes second when it comes to size, since it covers one-fifth of the total surface area of the Earth. Encompassing a total area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi), it covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth’s surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area.

Which is the coldest ocean in the world?
----------------------------------------

Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Ocean comes in third and occupies about 41,100,000 square miles, which is about 20% of the earth’s surface and 29% of the water on earth. This ocean’s lower temperatures compared to the Pacific Ocean are attributed to the higher contact with Arctic waters.
