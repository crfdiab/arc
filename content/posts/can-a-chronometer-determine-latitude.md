Can a chronometer determine latitude?
-------------------------------------

The marine chronometer Latitude could be determined by measuring the altitude of the Sun at noon or the altitude of any tabulated star when it crossed the local meridian, but the determination of longitude at sea remained a serious problem.

How do you measure longitude with a clock?
------------------------------------------

Time the difference between local noon, measured from the sun, and the 12 o’clock noon pips on the radio. If you reach local noon before the radio signal, you’re east of the Prime Meridian (0º longitude). If the radio signals noon while the sun is still climbing, you’re on a western longitude.

How do you measure longitude?
-----------------------------

Longitude is measured by imaginary lines that run around the Earth vertically (up and down) and meet at the North and South Poles. These lines are known as meridians. Each meridian measures one arcdegree of longitude. The distance around the Earth measures 360 degrees.

Who Discovered How do you calculate longitude?
----------------------------------------------

Great minds had tried for centuries to develop a method of determining longitude. Hipparchus, a Greek astronomer (190–120 BC), was the first to specify location using latitude and longitude as co-ordinates. He proposed a zero meridian passing through Rhodes.

What does a chronometer measure?
--------------------------------

The purpose of a chronometer is to measure accurately the time of a known fixed location, for example Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

What is another name for chronometer?
-------------------------------------

What is another word for chronometer?

Which comes first latitude or longitude?
----------------------------------------

Handy tip: when giving a co-ordinate, latitude (north or south) always precedes longitude (east or west). Latitude and longitude are divided in degrees (°), minutes (‘) and seconds (“).

What came first latitude or longitude?
--------------------------------------

Where is chronometer used?
--------------------------

Chronometer, portable timekeeping device of great accuracy, particularly one used for determining longitude at sea.

How is the Longitude determined with a chronometer?
---------------------------------------------------

To determine “longitude by chronometer,” a navigator requires a chronometer set to the local time at the Prime Meridian. Local time at the Prime Meridian has historically been called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), but now, due to international sensitivities, has been renamed as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and is known colloquially as “zulu time”.

Where is the correct position of the chronometer?
-------------------------------------------------

This correction is applied to the assumed position so that a position line can be drawn through the assumed latitude at the corrected longitude at 90° to the azimuth (bearing) on the celestial body. The observer’s position is somewhere along the position line, not necessarily at the found longitude at the assumed latitude.

How is the true hour angle calculated in chronometer?
-----------------------------------------------------

This formula calculates the ‘True Hour Angle’ which is compared to the assumed longitude providing a correction to the assumed longitude. This correction is applied to the assumed position so that a position line can be drawn through the assumed latitude at the corrected longitude at 90° to the azimuth (bearing) on the celestial body.

How is longitude measured from the prime meridian?
--------------------------------------------------

Longitude is measured east and west from the Prime Meridian. To determine “longitude by chronometer,” a navigator requires a chronometer set to the local time at the Prime Meridian. Local time at the Prime Meridian has historically been called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), but now, due to international sensitivities,…
