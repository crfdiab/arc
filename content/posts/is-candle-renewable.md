Is candle renewable?
--------------------

Paraffin wax is the most commonly used wax to make candles, largely because it is cheaper and more accessible than soy wax. So while soy wax is made from environmentally friendly, renewable resources, paraffin is a by-product of petroleum and thus non-renewable.

Is wax bad for the environment?
-------------------------------

The extraction and production of petrochemicals is generally polluting, though plant or bee-derived alternatives are not without their own environmental impacts. Wax is hard to wash away, so applicators and strips tend to be thrown out, adding to the waste sent to landfill.

Is wax natural or manmade?
--------------------------

Like paraffin, which is a byproduct of petroleum refinement, many waxes are manmade—but a surprising waxy smorgasbord also appears in the natural world.

Is paraffin wax renewable?
--------------------------

Soy wax is made from environmentally friendly, renewable resources; whereas classic paraffin wax is made from petroleum and is non-renewable.

What is the most environmentally friendly candle wax?
-----------------------------------------------------

Beeswax Candles  
Beeswax Candles The most natural – and by far the most expensive – raw material for candles is beeswax. Especially when they come from organic beekeeping, beeswax candles are the most environmentally friendly type.

Which wax is hardest?
---------------------

Carnauba  
Carnauba, the hardest natural wax available, is brittle, non-tacky and lustrous. Its major application is in the production of carbon paper inks where it helps produce sharp, distinct, blur-free images.

What wax is made of?
--------------------

Paraffin wax, colourless or white, somewhat translucent, hard wax consisting of a mixture of solid straight-chain hydrocarbons ranging in melting point from about 48° to 66° C (120° to 150° F). Paraffin wax is obtained from petroleum by dewaxing light lubricating oil stocks.

Why paraffin wax is bad?
------------------------

Most candles today are made of paraffin wax which creates highly toxic benzene and toluene when burned (both are known carcinogens). In fact, the toxins released from paraffin candles are the same as those found in diesel fuel fumes and are linked to asthma and lung cancer.

Why are candles bad for you?
----------------------------

Burning candles releases volatile organic compounds and particulate matter into the air. Particulate matter is a mixture of extremely small liquid droplets and particles that can enter your lungs. There’s concern that extended exposure to particulate matter can lead to heart and lung problems.

Is the wax in soy candles biodegradable?
----------------------------------------

Is soy wax is the only biodegradable wax? No. Studies have shown that beeswax, paraffin and vegetable-based waxes are all biodegradable. Are soy candles better for your health?

How does soy wax become an eco-friendly product?
------------------------------------------------

Just saying ‘Eco-friendly’ doesn’t make a product Eco-friendly. It’s much more complex than that. While a soy plant is a natural product, soy wax is not. The plant is grown, then distributed, then processed – to be burnt as wax.

What kind of wax do you use for marijuana?
------------------------------------------

Let’s start from the beginning. What Is Marijuana Wax? Marijuana wax is a form of hash oil concentrate (or just “concentrate”) often produced using a process known as butane hash oil extraction. If those terms are foreign to you, don’t worry. We’ll explain them in the next section.

Is it safe to use 100% soy wax?
-------------------------------

The phrase 100% soy wax can be misleading. A candle using soy wax is processed (like other candles) and has additives (like other candles) to make it burn. There’s no significant, scientifically backed evidence to prove that soy wax is in any way less harmful, or cleaner burning than other wax types.
