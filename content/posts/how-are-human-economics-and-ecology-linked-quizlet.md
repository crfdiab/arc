---------------------------------------------------

How are human economics and ecology linked? humans live within the biosphere and depend on ecological processes to provide such essentials as food and drinkable water that can be bought, sold, or traded. Explain the relationship between ecosystems and biomes.

How are economics and ecology related?
--------------------------------------

After all, the study of economics concerns how people use resources, and the study of ecology encompasses how organisms relate to each other. Human economics and ecology represent two sciences that are more related than you may realize.

How is ecology related to humans?
---------------------------------

Human ecology is the discipline that inquires into the patterns and process of interaction of humans with their environments. Human values, wealth, life-styles, resource use, and waste, etc. must affect and be affected by the physical and biotic environments along urban-rural gradients.

Why do ecologists make models?
------------------------------

Why do Ecologist make models? Ecologists make models to gain insight into complex phenomena. Many ecological models consist of mathematical formulas based on data collected through observation and experimentation. The predictions made by ecological models are often tested by further observations and experiments.

What is ecology studying our living planet?
-------------------------------------------

What is ecology? Scientific study of interactions among organisms and between organisms and their environment. 2. What does the biosphere contain?

Why do we need ecology?
-----------------------

Why is ecology important? Ecology enriches our world and is crucial for human wellbeing and prosperity. It provides new knowledge of the interdependence between people and nature that is vital for food production, maintaining clean air and water, and sustaining biodiversity in a changing climate.

Why is studying ecology difficult?

Why are many ecological phenomena difficult to study? Many ecological phenomena occur over long periods of time or on such large spatial scales that they are difficult to study. Ecologists make models to gain insight into complex phenomena such as the effects of global warming on ecosystems.

What makes a planet living?

---------------------------------------------------

ecologist measure what in grams of organic matter per unit area biomass why do we study ecology? we live in a natural world and use its resources, natural effects our lives, and protect biodiversity abitoc factor non-living, physical componets, necessary for biotic to survive, ex: heat, weather, temp, current, and soil biotic

How are biotic factors and ecology related to one another?
----------------------------------------------------------

Biotic factors are living parts of the environment that affect other living things, such as producers, consumers, and decomposers. A key part of ecology is the study of the interactions between these two environmental factors and how they affect the ecosystem as a whole.
