How does real sun look like?
----------------------------

It is a common misconception that the Sun is yellow, or orange or even red. However, the Sun is essentially all colors mixed together, which appear to our eyes as white. This is easy to see in pictures taken from space. Rainbows are light from the Sun, separated into its colors.

Can we see the real sun?
------------------------

Our sun is an incredible fusion engine. From the surface of earth, we see it as a mere ball of light, but through amazing high-res imaging capabilities, we can observe real solar activities thanks to NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory.

How the sun Will Die?
---------------------

In about 5.5 billion years the Sun will run out of hydrogen and begin expanding as it burns helium. It will swap from being a yellow giant to a red giant, expanding beyond the orbit of Mars and vaporizing Earth—including the atoms that make-up you.

Is a piece of the sun missing?
------------------------------

A huge portion of the sun’s corona, or outer atmosphere, has indeed gone missing. (See the explanation below.) But the word “chunk” implies that a really thick piece of the sun is gone.

What color is the real sun?
---------------------------

white  
When we direct solar rays through a prism, we see all the colors of the rainbow come out the other end. That’s to say we see all the colors that are visible to the human eye. “Therefore the sun is white,” because white is made up of all the colors, Baird said.

Is the Sun black?
-----------------

As with all matter, the sun emits a “black body spectrum” that is defined by its surface temperature. So, the sun actually emits energy at all wavelengths from radio to gamma ray. But, as can be seen in the image above, it emits most of its energy around 500 nm, which is close to blue-green light.

What color is real sun?
-----------------------

Is the sun white?
-----------------

The color of the sun is white. The sun emits all colors of the rainbow more or less evenly and in physics, we call this combination “white”. The sun emits all these colors because it is a thermal body and emits light through the process of thermal radiation.

What would happen if sun disappeared?
-------------------------------------

With no sunlight, photosynthesis would stop, but that would only kill some of the plants—there are some larger trees that can survive for decades without it. Within a few days, however, the temperatures would begin to drop, and any humans left on the planet’s surface would die soon after.

What does the sun actually look like up close?
----------------------------------------------

The incredible image looks like scorched earth and was taken from 789 nanometers. The light and shade in the image are indicative of the gas’s violent movements. Bright spots appear when the hot solar material is rising up. As it cools and sinks in a process known as convection, it forms dark lanes.

Where is the Sun located in the Solar System?
---------------------------------------------

A light year is the distance light travels in one year, which is equal to 5,878,499,810,000 miles or 9,460,528,400,000 kilometers. The Sun, and everything that orbits it, is located in the Milky Way galaxy. More specifically, our Sun is in a spiral arm called the Orion Spur that extends outward from the Sagittarius arm.

Is the Sun also rises a true story?
-----------------------------------

The Real Story Behind Ernest Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises. According to Blume, Hemingway’s fiesta compatriots were unnerved by how realistically and unsympathetically they’d been portrayed in his book: “The portraits would haunt \[them\] for the rest of their lives, but for Hemingway, his one-time friends were simply collateral damage.

How old is the Sun in our Solar System?
---------------------------------------

So our Sun is about halfway through its life. But don’t worry. It still has about 5,000,000,000—five billion—years to go. When those five billion years are up, the Sun will become a red giant. That means the Sun will get bigger and cooler at the same time. When that happens, it will be different than the Sun we know today.

What happens to the Sun in five billion years?
----------------------------------------------

When those five billion years are up, the Sun will become a red giant. That means the Sun will get bigger and cooler at the same time. When that happens, it will be different than the Sun we know today. As a red giant, our Sun will become about 2,000 times brighter than it is now!
