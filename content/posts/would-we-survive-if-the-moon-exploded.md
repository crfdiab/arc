Would we survive if the Moon exploded?
--------------------------------------

The moon slows down the Earth’s rotation, but a moon explosion would disrupt the friction. If the explosion doesn’t alter the Earth’s rotation, the lack of moon would cause the Earth to rotate at a constant speed. This means that every day would be 24 hours long for the rest of the Earth’s existence.

How long would it take to sail to the Moon?
-------------------------------------------

On average it takes around three days for a manned spacecraft to get to the Moon. This is based on the nine manned missions to the Moon and the six which landed on it’s surface.

What happens if the Moon escapes from Earth?
--------------------------------------------

Only if a large object like Mars comes close to the Earth-Moon system is there any chance of an event like this happening. If the Moon did escape from Earth, the main effect would be the lack of tides on Earth.

What happens to a bullet fired on the Moon?
-------------------------------------------

Assuming your bullet doesn’t hit anything (a pretty safe bet on the Moon, but don’t try this on Earth!) and forgetting about air resistance, the time it takes for the bullet to fall to the ground depends on its initial velocity, the angle at which you shoot it, and the force of gravity.

What happens to the tides if the Moon disappears?
-------------------------------------------------

If we all woke up one morning to find the Moon missing, most of us probably wouldn’t notice. Those who live near the oceans would find the tides reduced, but not completely absent. While the Moon does most of the gravitational tugging that creates our tides, the sun also plays a role.

How does the moon affect the night sky?
---------------------------------------

The moon casts lots of light during the night, blocking our ability to see distant, faint stars with the naked eye. This would make the night sky “seem” brighter because of the ability to see stars further away. Similar to what would happen if there was no moon, an moon explosion would change the Earth’s rotation and the size of the Earth’s tide.
