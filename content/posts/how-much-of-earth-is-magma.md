How much of Earth is magma?
---------------------------

More than 80 percent of the Earth’s surface–above and below sea level–is of volcanic origin. Gaseous emissions from volcanic vents over hundreds of millions of years formed the Earth’s earliest oceans and atmosphere, which supplied the ingredients vital to evolve and sustain life.

Does magma ever run out?
------------------------

A volcano occurs where there is magma rising from the mantle and burning its way through the crust. Volcanoes do run out of magma. That usually means that they become quiet and inactive for ten to 100 years until a new batch of magma comes up from deep inside the earth.

How far down is magma in the Earth?
-----------------------------------

The scientists found that the rock can and does liquify, at least in small amounts, at pressures equivalent to those found as deep as 250 kilometers down in the mantle beneath the ocean floor.

Why is the Earth’s core hot?
----------------------------

There are three main sources of heat in the deep earth: (1) heat from when the planet formed and accreted, which has not yet been lost; (2) frictional heating, caused by denser core material sinking to the center of the planet; and (3) heat from the decay of radioactive elements.

How big is the magma ocean on Earth?
------------------------------------

Previous calculations suggested that Earth possessed one or more giant oceans of magma, or molten rock. For instance, after a Mars-size rock slammed into Earth about 4.5 billion years ago to create the moon, prior research suggested a magma ocean about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) deep covered most of Earth’s surface, according to prior research.

Where does most of the Earths magma come from?
----------------------------------------------

However, the magma that comes out of volcanoes doesn’t come from the core of the Earth. Rather, it comes from the mantle part of the Earth, the part above the core and right below the crust. And the mantle is mostly not melted! The mantle is only about 10-20% melted and all the magma in the world comes from this small portion of the mantle.

Where was 240 cubic miles of magma found?
-----------------------------------------

The team found 240 cubic miles of semi-molten magma, with 27 percent in the liquid state. Cross section through the Long Valley supervolcano. At this point, there are no signs of an eruption and there’s the potential for the proportion of liquid magma to continue to decrease as the supervolcano continues to lie dormant.

How to calculate how much magma is in the mantle?
-------------------------------------------------

To try and think about how much magma is in the mantle (20%), fill up a container with one cup of sand. Then, add one-quarter cup of water. The sand represents the solid rock in the mantle and the water represents all the magma or melted rock in the mantle.
