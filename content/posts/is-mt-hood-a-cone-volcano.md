Is Mt Hood a cone volcano?
--------------------------

In addition one such shield volcano, the 425,000- year-old Cloud Cap volcano, erupted on the north flank of Hood from a vent only 5 kilometers or less from Hood’s summit. A cinder cone with flanking lava flows formed The Pinnacle on Hood’s north flank about 130,000 years ago.

What mountain range is Mt Hood?
-------------------------------

Cascade Range  
Mount Hood/Mountain range

Standing at 11,239 feet (3,425 meters), Mount Hood is the highest point in Oregon and the fourth highest peak in the Cascade Range.

How many glaciers are on Mt Hood?
---------------------------------

twelve glaciers  
Officially, Mount Hood has twelve glaciers, though two — the Langille on the north side and Palmer on the south side — seem to have slowed to permanent snowfield status.

Why is Mt Hood a stratovolcano?
-------------------------------

Mount Hood is a stratovolcano made of lava flows, domes, and volcaniclastic deposits. During the most recent eruptive period, 250-180 years ago, lava domes collapsed and produced numerous pyroclastic flows and lahars which buried the southwest flank of the mountain.

Will Mount Hood erupt?
----------------------

Mount Hood remains an active volcano — meaning that it will erupt again. And when it does, it could unleash mudflows not unlike those from Colombia’s Nevado del Ruiz volcano in 1985. If scientists miss early warning signs of an eruption, they might not know the volcano is about to blow until it’s too late.

What kind of volcano is Mount Hood in Oregon?
---------------------------------------------

Mount Hood, called Wy’east by the Multnomah tribe, is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc.

How tall is the peak of Mount Hood?
-----------------------------------

At its highest, Mount Hood topped 12,000 feet, with ice and erosion reducing the peak to its current height. Notable natural features include Cooper Spur, Illumination Rock, Barrett Spur, Mississippi Head, McNeil Point, Yocum Ridge, and Cathedral Ridge.

What kind of rock is Mount Hood made of?
----------------------------------------

Mount Hood has played a central role in the geology, history, natural environment, and culture that have helped shape northwest Oregon and the entire Pacific Northwest. Composed primarily of andesite and dacite, Mount Hood began to form during volcanic eruptions between 500,000 and 700,000 years ago.

How many ski areas are there on Mount Hood?
-------------------------------------------

The mountain has six ski areas: Timberline, Mount Hood Meadows, Ski Bowl, Cooper Spur, Snow Bunny, and Summit. They total over 4,600 acres (7.2 sq mi; 19 km 2) of skiable terrain; Timberline offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America.
