How animals in the Antarctic have adapted to the cold conditions?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Antarctic animals have unique behavioural adaptations that help them survive the harsh winter. Emperor penguins form large huddles. Huddles allow them to share body warmth, and shelters many of the penguins from the wind. The huddle constantly moves so that all the penguins have a turn in the middle.

What are some adaptations animals use?
--------------------------------------

Many animals have physical adaptations that serve as a disguise. They can hide out in the open because they blend into their environment. The adaptation that allows some animals to blend into their surroundings is camouflage . Color, patterns, and body shape are adaptations that help camouflage both predators and prey.

What are two examples of animal adaptations?
--------------------------------------------

Many animals have developed specific parts of the body adapted to survival in a certain environment. Among them are webbed feet, sharp claws, whiskers, sharp teeth, large beaks, wings, and hooves. In most aquatic animals, swimming is a must. To aid swimming, many animals have adapted and evolved with webbed feet.

How are animals adapted to live in Antarctica?
----------------------------------------------

Many of the animals living in Antarctica have outer layers of dense fur or water-repellent feathers. Under this fur or feather layer is a thick layer of insulating fat. Many marine animals have large eyes to help them spot prey and predators in the dark waters. They are further protected by their coloration, dark backs, and light undersides.

What do you need to know about Antarctica?
------------------------------------------

Make connections between AntarcticaΓÇÖs climate and migratory patterns. Create your own Antarctic animal and explain the ways it is suited to the environment. View the image gallery of Antarctic conditions. Describe the conditions faced by animals and plants living and surviving in Antarctica.

How are polar bears adapted to live in the Arctic?
--------------------------------------------------

Polar bears, narwhals, bowhead whales, and other creatures are able to live and thrive in the harsh climate of the Arctic because of their biological or behavioral adaptations. a modification of an organism or its parts that makes it more fit for existence. An adaptation is passed from generation to generation.

How does an animal adapt to its environment?
--------------------------------------------

All living things (including humans) on this planet have adaptations. Adaptations are influenced by environmental factors, including climate and food availability. Animals have needs like food, water, shelter, and breeding. To meet those needs, animals adapt to their environment. 1. Physical Adaptation
