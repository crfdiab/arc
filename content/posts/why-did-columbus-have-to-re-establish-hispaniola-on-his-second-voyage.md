Why did Columbus have to re establish Hispaniola on his second voyage?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Christopher Columbus – 2nd Voyage. Columbus left from Cádiz in Spain for his second voyage (1493-1496) on September 24, 1493, with 17 ships and about 1200 men. His aim was to conquer the Taíno tribe and colonise the region. Columbus hoped to make landfall at Hispaniola (where he had left 40 men the previous January).

What was Columbus objective in conquering Hispaniola?
-----------------------------------------------------

The primary goal of Columbus’s expedition was to find riches and conquer and exploit the new lands. Although various indigenous peoples had been settled in the Americas long before Columbus arrived, Columbus’s goal was to pillage the land for riches regardless of who stood in his way.

When did Columbus start the colonization of Hispaniola?
-------------------------------------------------------

Colonization began in earnest the following year when Columbus brought 1,300 men to Hispaniola in November 1493 with the intention of establishing a permanent settlement. They found the encampment at Navidad had been destroyed and all the crewmen left behind killed by the natives.

What did Christopher Columbus do for the Spanish monarchy?
----------------------------------------------------------

The explorer was the first in Europe to colonize territories in the New World, and he did so on behalf of the Spanish monarchy. Later Columbus established La Isabella and other settlements in Hispaniola, and Spain began conquering new regions on the American continents, according to the Library of Congress.

What did Christopher Columbus call the island of Hispaniola?
------------------------------------------------------------

Each caciquat was governed by a cacique (chief). Christopher Columbus renamed the island Española (Hispaniola) meaning “little Spain.” On December 5, 1492, Columbus anchored off the northern shoreline of Haiti, near modern Cap-Haïtien.

Where did Christopher Columbus settle in the New World?
-------------------------------------------------------

In 1492, Columbus founded the settlement of La Navidad in present-day Haiti, and landed at what is now the Dominican Republic, part of the land that Columbus called Hispaniola.
