--------------------------------------------

Basic Structure and Principle of Microscopes. A general biological microscope mainly consists of an objective lens, ocular lens, lens tube, stage, and reflector.

How is a microscope designed to magnify light?
----------------------------------------------

On the other hand, a microscope is designed to emit light onto or through objects and magnify the transmitted or reflected light with the objective and ocular lenses. Figure: Principle that enables magnified observation with a biological microscope

How is fine focusing done in a microscope?
------------------------------------------

Slowly turn the coarse adjustment so that the objective lens goes up (away from the slide). Continue until the image comes into focus. Use the fine adjustment, if available, for fine focusing. If you have a microscope with a moving stage, then turn the coarse knob so the stage moves downward or away from the objective lens.
