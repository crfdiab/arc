What is the true color of ocean water?
--------------------------------------

blue  
The ocean is blue because water absorbs colors in the red part of the light spectrum. Like a filter, this leaves behind colors in the blue part of the light spectrum for us to see. The ocean may also take on green, red, or other hues as light bounces off of floating sediments and particles in the water.

Is ocean water supposed to be green?
------------------------------------

The Answer Is in the Light When light strikes water, like sunlight, the water filters the light so that red is absorbed and some blue is reflected. Sometimes the ocean appears other colors besides blue. For example, the Atlantic off the East Coast of the United States usually appears green.

Is ocean water supposed to be brown?
------------------------------------

When the water looks murky or brown, it means there is a lot of mud, or sediment, in the water. Sediment particles can be so tiny that they take a long time to settle to the bottom, so they travel wherever the water goes. Rivers carry sediment into the bay, and waves and tides help keep the sediment suspended.

Why is Long Island beach water brown?
-------------------------------------

That’s when the warmer surface temperatures of the ocean move further out to sea and are replaced with deeper, colder and more sediment-rich waters. The Pacific Ocean is huge and turns a lot of water brownish-gray as a result of upwelling. Cloudier, gray water is more nutrient-rich than clear, sparkling water.

What colour is the ocean?
-------------------------

The best answer is that the ocean is blue because it is mostly water, which is blue in large quantities. When light strikes water, like sunlight, the water filters the light so that red is absorbed and some blue is reflected.

Why does the sea water have different colors?
---------------------------------------------

When sunlight hits the ocean, some of the light is reflected back directly but most of it penetrates the ocean surface and interacts with the water molecules that it encounters. Moreover, according to another explanation, algae growths are also responsible for the various different water colors.

Why is the water in the ocean blue?
-----------------------------------

Here’s the science behind the color of the sea. There are a few reasons why the ocean is blue. The best answer is that the ocean is blue because it is mostly water, which is blue in large quantities. When light strikes water, like sunlight, the water filters the light so that red is absorbed and some blue is reflected.

What are the three oceans that surround Canada?
-----------------------------------------------

The three oceans that surround Canada are the Atlantic Ocean on the east, the Pacific Ocean on the west and the Arctic Ocean to the north. Other major bodies of water in or near Canada are the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay. The planet currently has five defined oceans.
