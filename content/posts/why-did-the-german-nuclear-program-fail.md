Why did the German nuclear program fail?
----------------------------------------

As Heisenberg himself reported, the German scientists’ final experiment failed because the amount of uranium in the cubes was insufficient to trigger a sustained nuclear reaction. “If the Germans had pooled rather than divided their resources, they would have been significantly closer to creating a working reactor.”

Who agreed to build the atomic bomb?
------------------------------------

Robert Oppenheimer was put in charge of putting the pieces together at Los Alamos. After the final bill was tallied, nearly $2 billion had been spent on research and development of the atomic bomb. The Manhattan Project employed over 120,000 Americans. Secrecy was paramount.

Why us didn’t drop bomb Tokyo?
------------------------------

The U.S. likely did not target Tokyo for the atomic bomb strikes as it was the seat of the Emperor and the location of much of the high ranking military officers. These are precisely the people you do not want to kill if you want to negotiate a surrender, as they are the people you would be negotiating with.

Why did America create the atomic bomb?
---------------------------------------

President Truman authorized the use of the atom bombs in an effort to bring about Japan’s surrender in the Second World War. In the days following the bombings Japan surrendered. The Manhattan Project was the US government program during World War II that developed and built these first atomic bombs.

Why was the Manhattan Project kept a secret?
--------------------------------------------

A key component of keeping the Manhattan Project secret was making sure Project sites were secret and secure. One obvious reason the Manhattan Engineers District selected Los Alamos, NM, Oak Ridge, TN, and Hanford, WA as project sites was their geographic isolation.

Why did Japan declare war on the United States?
-----------------------------------------------

Japan had invaded much of East Asia to create what they called the “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere”, now largely viewed as a pretext for imperialism. Japan saw this as a hostile and provocative act, and retaliated with the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the declarations of war on the US and the British Empire.

What special ingredient is needed to build an atomic bomb?
----------------------------------------------------------

The raw material: uranium The key ingredient in a nuclear bomb is enriched uranium — or plutonium, which can be obtained through the combustion of uranium. Uranium is a relatively common mineral, found both in the ground and under the sea. Some 20 countries operate uranium mines.
