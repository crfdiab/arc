Why do we have night time when it is dark and we Cannot see the Sun?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

It is dark at night time because light from the sun is not visible/ there is no sunlight. When it is dark, there is no light to illuminate objects, so we can’t see them. We need light to be able to see things.

Why are we not getting sunlight during night?
---------------------------------------------

The part of Earth getting sunlight feels that the sun is shining, and it is daytime for them. The other part of Earth having no sunlight feels that the sun is not shining, and it is night for them. So, one complete rotation of Earth gives us a complete cycle of day and night.

Why do we only see the nighttime stars when the Sun is not visible?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Usually, the Sun’s light is so bright that it makes it impossible to see less bright, far away objects in the sky. These objects — other planets and stars — can usually only be seen at night when the Sun’s light doesn’t outshine them. They’re still there.

Why do we only see the Sun during the day?
------------------------------------------

“The sun is so bright during the day that it kind of drowns out the light from the moon and the stars,” says astrophysicist Cheyenne Polius. As the moon continues in its orbit around the Earth, away from the sun, increasingly more of its sunlit surface is visible.

Why night sky is black?
-----------------------

Despite the fact that blazing stars and galaxies shine throughout the universe, space is pitch black, rather than being brightly lit. One version implicated dust between stars and perhaps between galaxies. The idea was that the dust would block the light from faraway objects, making the sky dark.

Why is night time dark?
-----------------------

Earth’s shadow extends over a million kilometers into space. But, every day, as Earth turns on its axis, the part of the planet you’re standing on turns for a time so that you face into Earth’s shadow. When you face into the shadow, it’s night. When Earth turns so that you again face the direction of the sun, it’s day.

What happens to sunlight at night?
----------------------------------

The earth rotates on its axis once in twenty-four hours. The earth itself blocks out the sunlight and makes it possible to see the stars in the nighttime sky. The sun appears to be rising in the east in the morning and setting in the west in the evening because of the way the earth rotates.

Is it possible to see the sun at night?
---------------------------------------

From Earth, the Sun looks like it moves across the sky in the daytime and appears to disappear at night. Although it seems small when seen at sunrise or sunset, this is only because the Sun lies about 150 million km away from us.

Why is the sky so dark at night?
--------------------------------

The night sky is dominantly dark because either the light from newborn stars hasn’t reached us or the intervening matter isn’t sufficiently heated. Nature Universe

Why is the Sun not visible at night?
------------------------------------

The sun is perfectly visible to anyone standing outside on (or near to) the opposite side of the globe from you. You happen to be unable to see the sun when it is night time where you are. That is because the entire planet is in between you and it.

Why is it so hard to see at night?
----------------------------------

Having dirt and debris on your windshield makes it harder to see, especially at night. While driving at night, avoid looking at oncoming car lights head-on; instead, try to look to the side of the lights in order to minimize glare. If your night vision is really poor, you may want to avoid driving at night altogether.

How can you see the Sun at night?
---------------------------------

Shine the flashlight on the LEFT side of the ball; the right side should be mostly dark. This is what happens at night: some of the earth is well lit, some at the edges of the light are like sunup/sundown where the sun is just bright enough to send light over the horizon but not close enough yet to directly shine on the earth.
