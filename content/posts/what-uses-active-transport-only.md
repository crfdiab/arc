What uses active transport only?
--------------------------------

During active transport, substances move against the concentration gradient, from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. This process is “active” because it requires the use of energy (usually in the form of ATP). It is the opposite of passive transport.

Why is active transport better than passive?
--------------------------------------------

Matrix or permeases of the membrane are not involved. Active transport allows molecules to pass the cell membrane, disrupting the equilibrium established by the diffusion. A dynamic equilibrium of water, nutrients, gasses, and wastes is maintained by passive transport. Between cytosol and extracellular environment.

What would a cell use active transport instead of passive transport?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead, the cell must bring in more glucose molecules via active transport. In active transport, unlike passive transport, the cell expends energy (for example, in the form of ATP) to move a substance against its concentration gradient.

When would a cell use active transport?
---------------------------------------

To move substances against a concentration or electrochemical gradient, a cell must use energy. Active transport mechanisms do just this, expending energy (often in the form of ATP) to maintain the right concentrations of ions and molecules in living cells.

What is the difference between active transport and passive transport?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Active Transport uses ATP to pump molecules AGAINST/UP the concentration gradient. Transport occurs from a low concentration of solute to high concentration of solute. Requires cellular energy. Movement of molecules DOWN the concentration gradient. It goes from high to low concentration, in order to maintain equilibrium in the cells.

Why is active transport important to living cells?
--------------------------------------------------

Active transport maintains concentrations of ions and other substances needed by living cells in the face of these passive changes. Much of a cell’s supply of metabolic energy may be spent maintaining these processes. Because active transport mechanisms depend on cellular metabolism for energy,…

How is the transport of molecules across the cell membrane regulated?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Transport across a cell membrane is a tightly regulated process, because cell function is highly dependent on maintain strict concentrations of various molecules. When a molecule moves down its concentration gradient is it participating in passive transport; moving up the concentration gradient requires energy making it active transport.

How is glucose an example of active transport?
----------------------------------------------

In active transport, the molecules move against the concentration gradient whereas in passive transport, the molecules move along the concentration gradient. Uptake of glucose in the human intestine works on the principle of active transport. Simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis and filtration are examples of passive transport.
