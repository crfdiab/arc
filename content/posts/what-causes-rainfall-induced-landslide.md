What causes rainfall-induced landslide?
---------------------------------------

Experts said that the primary reason for the Oso mudslide was rain. Water can trigger landslides and mudslides because it alters the pressure within the slope, which leads to slope instability. Consequently, the heavy water-laden slope materials (soil, rock, etc.) will succumb to the forces of gravity.

What is the effects of rainfall-induced landslide?
--------------------------------------------------

Rainfall-induced landslides are a common occurrence in terrain with steep topography and soils that have degradable strength. Rainfall infiltration into a partially saturated slope of infinite extent can lead to either a decrease or complete elimination of soil suction, compromising the slopes’ stability.

What is the color of rain induced landslide?
--------------------------------------------

Rain-induced landslide hazard The map on the MGB’s website also indicates areas prone to rain-induced landslides with 3 colors – red, green, yellow. Red areas are highly susceptible to landslides. If a storm passes through a red area, people need to be alert.

How can rain induced landslide be prevented?
--------------------------------------------

There are also various direct methods of preventing landslides; these include modifying slope geometry, using chemical agents to reinforce slope material, installing structures such as piles and retaining walls, grouting rock joints and fissures, diverting debris pathways, and rerouting surface and underwater drainage.

What do you do during a rain induced landslide?
-----------------------------------------------

Evacuate immediately in cases of non-stop rainfall and when there are signs of landslide. Prepare your survival kit with provisions like food, drinking water, flashlight, transistor radio, etc.

How can we stop a landslide from happening?
-------------------------------------------

What does it mean to artificially increase precipitation?
---------------------------------------------------------

Rainmaking, also known as artificial precipitation, artificial rainfall and pluviculture, is the act of attempting to artificially induce or increase precipitation, usually to stave off drought or the wider global warming.

Are there any studies on rainfall induced landslides?
-----------------------------------------------------

Rainfall-induced landslides pose a substantial risk to people and infrastructure. For this reason, there have been numerous studies to understand the landslide mechanism. Most of them were performed on the numerical analysis and laboratory experiment.

How does the process of artificial rain work?
---------------------------------------------

This process is known as Cloud Seeding. This stimulation is done by aeroplanes or rockets. And then finally “rain on”. Why Artificial Rain? We know how the process of rain works. It starts from evaporating of water from the sea or any other water body.

What is the meaning of the term rainmaking?
-------------------------------------------

Rainmaking. The term is also used metaphorically to describe the process of bringing new clients into a professional practice, such as law, architecture, consulting, advertising, or investment banking—in general, processes that bring money into a company . It is also used to describe a confidence trick where the scammer takes money from…
