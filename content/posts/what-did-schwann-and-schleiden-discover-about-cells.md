What did Schwann and Schleiden discover about cells?
----------------------------------------------------

Schwann’s theory and observations became the foundation of modern histology. – 1839: Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden elucidate the principle that plants and animals are made of cells, concluding that cells are a common unit of structure and development, and thus founding the cell theory.

What was the major discovery of Schleiden?
------------------------------------------

In 1838, Matthias Schleiden, a German botanist, concluded that all plant tissues are composed of cells and that an embryonic plant arose from a single cell. He declared that the cell is the basic building block of all plant matter. This statement of Schleiden was the first generalizations concerning cells.

What is Schleiden responsible for?
----------------------------------

Schleiden studied cells as the common element among all plants and animals. Schleiden contributed to the field of embryology through his introduction of the Zeiss microscope lens and via his work with cells and cell theory as an organizing principle of biology. Schleiden was born in Hamburg, Germany, on 5 April 1804.

What did Schleiden proposed?
----------------------------

By the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed the unified cell theory. The unified cell theory states that: all living things are composed of one or more cells; the cell is the basic unit of life; and new cells arise from existing cells.

Why was Matthias Schleiden discovery so important?
--------------------------------------------------

In 1839 Schleiden and Schwann cofounded the cell theory. He also recognized the importance of the cell nucleus, discovered in 1831 by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown, and sensed its connection with cell division. Schleiden was one of the first German biologists to accept Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution.

Who proposed that cell is the unit of life?
-------------------------------------------

Theodor Schwann  
The classical cell theory was proposed by Theodor Schwann in 1839. There are three parts to this theory. The first part states that all organisms are made of cells. The second part states that cells are the basic units of life.
