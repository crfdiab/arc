What is the role of decomposers Class 5?
----------------------------------------

First, they act as a cleansing agent of the environment by decomposing dead plants and animals. They help in recycling the nutrients. They provide space for new being in the biosphere by decomposing the dead. They help put back the various elements into water, soil and air for the reuse of producers like crop plants.

What do decomposers have?
-------------------------

Decomposers (fungi, bacteria, invertebrates such as worms and insects) have the ability to break down dead organisms into smaller particles and create new compounds. We use decomposers to restore the natural nutrient cycle through controlled composting. Decomposers are the link that keeps the circle of life in motion.

What are decomposers Why are they important?
--------------------------------------------

Decomposers play a critical role in the flow of energy through an ecosystem. They break apart dead organisms into simpler inorganic materials, making nutrients available to primary producers.

What are the decomposers and what do they do?
---------------------------------------------

Nature has its own recycling system: a group of organisms called decomposers. Decomposers feed on dead things: dead plant materials such as leaf litter and wood, animal carcasses, and feces. They perform a valuable service as Earthâ€™s cleanup crew.

What do decomposers do with an empty bottle?
--------------------------------------------

When you have an empty bottle, do you recycle it so the plastic or glass can be used again? Nature has its own recycling system: a group of organisms called decomposers. Decomposers feed on dead things: dead plant materials such as leaf litter and wood, animal carcasses, and feces.

Which is the best decomposer of organic matter?
-----------------------------------------------

The growth of fungi is characterized with the presence of hyphae. Bacteria also decompose materials. They are the unicellular organisms which can break down only the surfaces of organic matters. Get facts about bacterial cells here. The larger pieces of organic matters are easier to break down by fungi because they can use the hyphae.

Why are fungi important decomposers in a forest?
------------------------------------------------

Fungi are important decomposers, especially in forests. Some kinds of fungi, such as mushrooms, look like plants. But fungi do not contain chlorophyll, the pigment that green plants use to make their own food with the energy of sunlight. Instead, fungi get all their nutrients from dead materials that they break down with special enzymes.
