Who invented solid liquid and gas?
----------------------------------

British scientist Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) made a key discovery when he isolated oxygen, a gas he called dephlogisticated air, in keeping with the theory of that time that a mysterious substance called phlogiston was in all substances.

Who first discovered states of matter?
--------------------------------------

The ancient Greeks were the first to identify three classes (what we now call states) of matter based on their observations of water.

Who discovered gas state?
-------------------------

The word gas was first used by the early 17th-century Flemish chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont. He identified carbon dioxide, the first known gas other than air.

What do scientists call solid liquid and gas?
---------------------------------------------

states of matter  
Solids, liquids and gases are known as states of matter. Before we look at why things are called solids, liquids or gases, we need to know more about matter. This animation explores water as a solid, liquid and gas. The water molecules stay the same, but they behave differently as they change from one form to another.

Who was the scientist who called the gas oxygen an element?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The confusion of exactly what Priestley had discovered was solved by French chemist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743–1794) who named the gas oxygen and called it an element, an element being by his definition a unique chemical substance. Priestley did not agree with Lavoisier.

Which is the only substance that is naturally found as a solid?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Water is the only common substance that is naturally found as a solid, liquid or gas. Solids, liquids and gases are known as states of matter.

What do students learn about solids, liquids, and gases?
--------------------------------------------------------

Students will learn the properties that make solids, liquids, and gases unique as well as their commonalities through simple investigations. Students will also explore how matter can change through the application of energy by conducting simple experiments.
