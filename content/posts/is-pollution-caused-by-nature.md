Is pollution caused by nature?
------------------------------

Some of the natural sources of air pollution are organic compounds from plants, sea salt, suspended soils and dusts (e.g. from the Sahara). Other natural sources are released during catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires.

How does human pollute nature?
------------------------------

Humans impact the physical environment in many ways: overpopulation, pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. Changes like these have triggered climate change, soil erosion, poor air quality, and undrinkable water.

Why is nature polluted?
-----------------------

Every year, millions of tons of industrial waste, household garbage, fertilizer, and pesticides are dumped into nature. Many of these substances are not biodegradable, which means that microorganisms in the ground cannot break them down. Things like metal cans, glass, and most plastics accumulate in the environment.

How does pollution affect the quality of the environment?
---------------------------------------------------------

Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.

What kind of pollution is produced by human activity?
-----------------------------------------------------

These harmful materials are called pollutant s. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land. Many things that are useful to people produce pollution. Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes.

How are air pollutants harmful to the environment?
--------------------------------------------------

Air pollutants speed the erosion of statues and buildings, which in some instances, destroys works of art. The most serious result of pollution is its harmful biological effects on human health and on the food-chain of animals, birds, and marine life.

Which is a natural cause of water pollution?
--------------------------------------------

Natural causes of water pollution include algae blooms and volcanos. However, humans also cause water pollution through trash and wastewater from factories. Land pollution is another one of the big three pollution types affecting the human population. Land pollution happens when the soil gets contaminated by fertilizers or chemicals being dumped.
