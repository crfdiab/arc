What happened to the water levels during the ice ages?
------------------------------------------------------

During the Ice Age, much of Earth’s water was trapped in glaciers. Most of the water came from the ocean—so much that sea level dropped by 125 meters (400 feet)!

How did the ice age impact the level of water in the ocean?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Melting Ice Glaciers and ice sheets, large land-based formations of ice, are melting as global temperatures rise. That meltwater drains into the sea, increasing the ocean’s water volume and global sea level.

Were the oceans higher or lower during the ice age?
---------------------------------------------------

During the last ice age glaciers covered almost one-third of Earth’s land mass, with the result being that the oceans were about 400 feet (122 meters) lower than today. During the last global “warm spell,” about 125,000 years ago, the seas were about 18 feet (5.5. meters) higher than they are now.

Was the sea level higher in the past?
-------------------------------------

Sea levels rose at up to 3 metres per century, far exceeding the roughly 0.3-metre rise observed over the past 150 years.

How did sea levels change during the ice age?
---------------------------------------------

There are many Clovis-Indian and other very ancient Indian sites found under 100+ feet of water in the Gulf of Mexico in areas that would have been dry land during the height of the last ice age. Sea levels 300 to 400 feet below their current levels mean that the shape of the earth’s continents would have been very different in the past.

How did the ice ages affect the plants?
---------------------------------------

During the ice ages, carbon dioxide levels drop by as much as 50 percent, causing the majority of plants, which require high levels of carbon dioxide (known as C3 plants) to decline.

Where was dry land during the ice age?
--------------------------------------

Generalized coast of Florida during the Ice Age. If the water was just 50 feet lower it would almost double the area from this to the east. There are many Clovis-Indian and other very ancient Indian sites found under 100+ feet of water in the Gulf of Mexico in areas that would have been dry land during the height of the last ice age.

What was the main cause of the Little Ice Age?
----------------------------------------------

Decreased human population: Major population declines caused by rampant plagues and high infant mortality may have had the effect of decreased agricultural activity and reforestation. In turn, this would have altered the balance of CO2 and O2 in the atmosphere and created a cooling effect. 6.
