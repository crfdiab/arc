Do volcanoes form when two plates move together?
------------------------------------------------

If two tectonic plates collide, they form a convergent plate boundary. The new magma (molten rock) rises and may erupt violently to form volcanoes, often building arcs of islands along the convergent boundary.

Do all volcanoes form along plate boundaries?
---------------------------------------------

Do all volcanoes form along a plate boundary? Not all volcanoes form along plate boundaries but some volcanoes form along a hot spot.

Does volcanoes form in the middle of a tectonic plate?
------------------------------------------------------

Volcanic Hotspots Although most volcanoes are found at convergent or divergent plate boundaries, intraplate volcanoes are found in the middle of a tectonic plate. As the plume rises through the mantle, pressure is released and mantle melts to create a hotspot. Earth is home to about 50 known hot spots.

Why do volcanoes happen at plate boundaries?
--------------------------------------------

On land, volcanoes form when one tectonic plate moves under another. Usually a thin, heavy oceanic plate subducts, or moves under, a thicker continental plate. When this happens, the ocean plate sinks into the mantle.

Why do some volcanoes develop in the middle of tectonic plates?
---------------------------------------------------------------

How are volcanoes formed in the mid ocean ridge?
------------------------------------------------

Earthâ€™s crust is made up of tectonic plates. Mid-ocean ridge volcanoes form where two plates are moving apart. As the plates move apart, cracks form in the crust. Magma from the mantle surges up these cracks, and erupts onto the surface, forming new crust. Mid-ocean ridges are very difficult to study because they are usually deep underwater.

Where do volcanoes form when two plates move together?
------------------------------------------------------

Volcanoes form along the mid-ocean ridges, where two plates move together. True or False? Not all volcanoes form along plate boundaries. Nice work!

What happens when two tectonic plates collide?
----------------------------------------------

If two tectonic plates collide, they form a convergent plate boundary. Usually, one of the converging plates will move beneath the other, which is known as subduction. The new magma (molten rock) rises and may erupt violently to form volcanoes, often building arcs of islands along the convergent boundary.

How are volcanoes formed and what causes them to erupt?
-------------------------------------------------------

This releases pressure on the mantle, which lowers its melting temperature. Lava erupts through long cracks in the ground, or fissures. Volcanoes erupt at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge, where seafloor spreading creates new seafloor in the rift valleys.
