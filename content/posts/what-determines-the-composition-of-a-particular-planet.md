What determines the composition of a particular planet?
-------------------------------------------------------

Each element absorbs light at specific wavelengths unique to that atom. When astronomers look at an object’s spectrum, they can determine its composition based on these wavelengths. The most common method astronomers use to determine the composition of stars, planets, and other objects is spectroscopy.

How do scientists determine the composition of the Earth?
---------------------------------------------------------

Seismograms, which are recordings produced by seismographs, are the main way that scientists know what Earth’s interior is made of. We can see that the crust is solid material, but we require body waves to tell us about the rest of it. We know that the mantle is solid because both P and S waves travel through it.

How is the composition and structure of the Earth determined?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Core, mantle, and crust are divisions based on composition. The crust makes up less than 1 percent of Earth by mass, consisting of oceanic crust and continental crust is often more felsic rock. The core makes up about 31% of the Earth. Lithosphere and asthenosphere are divisions based on mechanical properties.

How can astronomers determine the chemical composition of stars?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The astronomers can determine the chemical composition of stars by analyzing their emission and absorption as the spectra of the sun and the stars exhibits bright and dark lines are these can be caused by the elements absorbing and emitting light at the specific wavelengths, 2.

What is the general composition of the inner and outer planets?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The inner planets are made of rocky material, which has higher density; these are often known as terrestrial (earth-like) planets. The outer planets are made mostly of low density gases; these are often known as Jovian (Jupiter-like) planets.

However, we know what the composition and size of the Earth are, specifically its density, so we can apply that same information in comparison to other planets. If we find an Earth-sized planet that has the same density, then we can assume that they are made of similar components (silicate rock surrounding an iron and nickel core).

How are scientists confident about the composition of other planets?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

However, considering that we’ve only been to the surface of two other planets in our own solar system (not counting the moon), we seem to be very confident about the composition of many other planets and moons in our solar system and beyond. Are scientists just guessing when they call a planet potentially habitable?

How are astronomers able to determine the composition of an object?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When astronomers look at an object’s spectrum, they can determine its composition based on these wavelengths. The most common method astronomers use to determine the composition of stars, planets, and other objects is spectroscopy. Today, this process uses instruments with a grating that spreads out the light from an object by wavelength.

How can scientists tell if a volcano is about to erupt?
-------------------------------------------------------

Scientists use seismographs that record the length and strength of each earthquake to try to determine if an eruption is imminent. Magma and gas can push the volcano’s slope upward. Most ground deformation is subtle and can only be detected by tiltmeters, which are instruments that measure the angle of the slope of a volcano.
