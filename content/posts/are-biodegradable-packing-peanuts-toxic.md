Are biodegradable packing peanuts toxic?
----------------------------------------

The starch in the peanuts comes from crop-based sources rather than petroleum-based polystyrene, and is non-toxic. Biodegradable foam peanuts have no electrostatic charge, another benefit over polystyrene. Being biodegradable and nontoxic, they are also safe for humans and pets if ingested accidentally.

What polymer is used in packing peanuts?
----------------------------------------

Packing peanuts made from cornstarch are natural polymers or polymers which occur in nature. Polystyrene or Styrofoam peanuts are a synthetic polymer, which means that they are man-made. Because the Styrofoam peanuts are man made the factory they are made in have a harmful environmental impact.

Why are packing peanuts not recyclable?
---------------------------------------

Why Reuse Packing Peanuts? Packing peanuts (and other EPS) are among the most common sources of marine debris, where they can be mistaken as food by birds and fish. Packing peanuts don’t biodegrade, meaning it will take hundreds of years for them to decompose in a landfill.

Are packing peanuts environmentally friendly?
---------------------------------------------

Fortunately, with the increasing awareness of the materials’ impact on the environment, biodegradable packing peanuts are now available as a more eco-friendly alternative to the traditional polystyrene peanuts. Biodegradable packing peanuts are made from natural, nontoxic sources, such as wheat and corn starch.

How long does it take for packing peanuts to decompose?
-------------------------------------------------------

While foam packing peanuts may pollute the planet for centuries after their disposal, biodegradable packing peanuts typically degrade within a few hours or days, leaving behind no toxic residue, chemicals, or microplastics.

Are packing peanuts toxic to dogs?
----------------------------------

Styrofoam and packing peanuts are toxic to dogs and your doggo needs immediate medical attention if he’s managed to swallow some of this packing plastic.

How do you know if packing peanuts are recyclable?
--------------------------------------------------

The Simplest Test for Biodegradable Packing Peanuts There’s one easy and nearly foolproof way to tell if packing peanuts are biodegradable: Place a few of them under a faucet and turn the water on. If the peanuts are biodegradable, they will begin to break down and disintegrate within a few minutes.

How do you know if packing peanuts are biodegradable?
-----------------------------------------------------

Running water over packing peanuts is the easiest way to determine if they are biodegradable. Biodegradable packing peanuts dissolve in water as the organic compounds will begin to breakdown. It only takes a few minutes for the pellets to completely dissolve.

What kind of material are packing peanuts made out of?
------------------------------------------------------

How to Recycle Packing Peanuts. The packing peanuts (you may know them as “popcorn”) used to protect shipped materials from damage are made of expanded polystyrene (EPS), which most of us mistakenly confuse with the Dow Chemical Company trademarked name Styrofoam.

Can you recycle packing peanuts into raw material?
--------------------------------------------------

First of all, EPS is not technically “recycled.” Recycling involves converting a product back into raw materials, and since you can’t un-expand a plastic, you can’t convert EPS into raw polystyrene. However, you can turn old packing peanuts into new products.

What makes biodegradable packing peanuts break down in water?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Enter the biodegradable packing peanut. Made from plant-based ingredients, such as wheat or cornstarch, biodegradable peanuts simply dissolve when they come into contact with water. Unlike other biodegradable materials that can take years to completely break down, this process happens in minutes.

How can you tell if packing peanuts are made of polystyrene?
------------------------------------------------------------

Green packing peanuts can easily be distinguished from polystyrene. To tell if a packing peanut is made from starch or polystyrene, simply add a few of the packing peanut to a glass of water and let it stand for a few minutes. If the packing peanuts begin to melt, then it is made from starch if otherwise then it’s made from polystyrene.
