What kind of animals live in a lake?
------------------------------------

For example, in lakes, you can find fish, insects, amphibians, and birds. Diverse species inhabit large freshwater lakes, and some live there permanently. On the other hand, others only live there occasionally, depending on the time of year or the stage of their lives. Lake ecosystems are very varied.

What kind of animals live in the Lake District?
-----------------------------------------------

Perhaps the most iconic of all of the wildlife that has found a sanctuary in the Lake District is the Red Squirrel. Native to the UK, its numbers have reduced significantly since the introduction of its cousin the Grey Squirrel. Grey Squirrels carry the squirrelpox virus, which whilst harmless to carriers, is deadly to Red Squirrels.

Prof Sand-Jensen said: “Small lakes are usually shallow and submerged plants can cover most of the lake bottom and, thereby, dictate the processes in the entire lake ecosystems.

What kind of plants are found in lakes?
---------------------------------------

However, being immediately hired as an assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen’s freshwater institute, I shifted from marine plants to studies of freshwater plants in lakes and streams. Simultaneously, I have from time to time studied marine macroalgae and seagrasses and more recently even terrestrial plants.

What happens to the water in a lake?
------------------------------------

The fall of the cooling waterat night drives round the circulation of the lake, pushing the refreshed carbon dioxide-rich water back to the top of the lake. A lake is a complex ecosystem, but a lot of it is also a hidden ecosystem. What led Prof Sand-Jensen to look beneath the surface?
