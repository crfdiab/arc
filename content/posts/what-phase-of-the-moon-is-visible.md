What phase of the Moon is visible?
----------------------------------

The new moon is visible all day long. Waxing Crescent phase occurs when the western edge of the Moon is lit but most of the surface visible from Earth is dark. The amount of illumination visible is growing from day to day during this phase which is what is meant by “waxing.”

What is the best time of day to see a crescent moon?
----------------------------------------------------

Morning Crescent. The waning crescent moon rises a couple of hours before the sun rises and is barely visible all day long and then sets a couple of hours before the sun. (The best time to see it is just before sunrise.)

How does a crescent moon appear?
--------------------------------

At new moon, the Moon is lined up between the Earth and the Sun. A few days after new moon, we see a thin crescent in the western evening sky. The crescent Moon waxes, or appears to grow fatter, each night. When half of the Moon’s disc is illuminated, we call it the first quarter moon.

Why is the Moon visible in the night sky?
-----------------------------------------

The Moon produces no light of its own like the Sun does. Instead, we see the Moon because of the Sun’s light reflects back to our eyes. In fact, the Moon reflects so much of the Sun’s light that it’s the second brightest object in the sky after the Sun.

Is the crescent moon visible in the middle of the night?
--------------------------------------------------------

Cartoonists often depict the crescent Moon in a midnight sky, but this is impossible: The night’s middle hours are for the broad, or fat, phases of the Moon—gibbous and full. What is a Crescent Moon? When the Moon appears early in its first quarter or late in its last quarter, only a small arc-shaped section is visible and illuminated by the Sun.

How long does it take for the waning crescent of the Moon to appear?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

? Waning Crescent: In the Northern Hemisphere, we see the waning crescent phase as a thin crescent of light on the left. The Moon displays these eight phases one after the other as it moves through its cycle each month. It takes 27 days for the Moon to orbit Earth.

What’s the difference between a crescent and a waxing moon?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Waxing means that it is growing, while crescent refers to the curved shape similar to a banana or a boat. With some variations, the Waxing Crescent Moon rises in the daytime before noon and becomes visible in the day sky. It gets more visible around sunset but normally sets before midnight.

How many days does it take for the phases of the Moon to appear?
----------------------------------------------------------------

? Waning Crescent: In the Northern Hemisphere, we see the waning crescent phase as a thin crescent of light on the left. The Moon displays these eight phases one after the other as it moves through its cycle each month. It takes 27 days for the Moon to orbit Earth. That means the Moon’s cycle is 27 days long.
