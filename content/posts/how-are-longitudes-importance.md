How are longitudes importance?
------------------------------

1 &gt; It locates a place on globe by making grids. 2 &gt; It tells us about the climatic conditions of a place. 3 &gt; It divides the whole earth in small parts. 8 &gt; It provides a way for specifying how east/west or north/south an object is.

What determines time latitude or longitude?
-------------------------------------------

An important factor in determining time zones is the lines of latitude and longitude. Imaginary lines known as latitude and longitude divide the Earth. Latitude lines are “drawn” east and west and they measure north and south.

How does longitude determine time zones?
----------------------------------------

Time zones are another arbitrary societal choice, like the origin point of the Prime Meridian. They are based on longitude and defined by Earth’s rotation, which completes a full circle (360 degrees) each day (24 hours). Each hour then, Earth rotates through 360/24 = 15° of longitude: the width of one time zone.

Why are the degrees of longitude and latitude important?
--------------------------------------------------------

The Earth is divided into degrees of longitude and latitude which helps us measure location and time using a single standard. Longitude and latitude lines measure the distance from the Earth’s Equator or central axis – running east to west – and the Prime Meridian in Greenwich, England – running north to south.

Why is it important to learn to tell time?
------------------------------------------

More than reading, writing, counting and knowing how to coordinate body muscles, telling time has a lot of skills that are put into practice once the young one starts learning about clocks, hours, minutes and seconds.

Where are latitude, longitude and time zones located?
-----------------------------------------------------

Latitude, Longitude and Time Zones Longitude and latitude are imaginary lines that circle the Earth. They are used to exactly pinpoint where a person or object is located. These lines are located on maps and measured in degrees.

Is it possible to calculate the difference in longitude and latitude?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For two locations differing in both longitude and latitude, if the latitudes and the distance between them are known, as well as the size of the earth, it is possible to calculate the difference in longitude.
