What is the relationship of magma and lava?
-------------------------------------------

Magma is composed of molten rock and is stored in the Earth’s crust. Lava is magma that reaches the surface of our planet through a volcano vent.

What is the relationship between magma and lava quizlet?
--------------------------------------------------------

Magma is hot, molten rock under the earth’s surface; lava is when magma reaches the earth’s surface (it is then called lava).

Why are magma and lava alike?
-----------------------------

When geologists refer to magma, they’re talking about molten rock that’s still trapped underground. If this molten rock makes it to the surface and keeps flowing like a liquid, it’s called lava. Silicic magmas, on the other hand, tend to form when the lighter continental crust melts.

How are magma and lava similar to each other?
---------------------------------------------

Magma and lava are similar because both are molten rock. The molten rock comes from heat within the Earth. Once cooled, both magma and lava will form… See full answer below. Our experts can answer your tough homework and study questions. Magma is molten rock found below the earth’s surface.

When does magma reach the surface it becomes lava?
--------------------------------------------------

When magma reaches the surface and erupts from a volcano, it officially becomes lava. There are actually different kinds of lava depending on its thickness or viscosity.

How did lava get its name from a volcano?
-----------------------------------------

Once magma gets to the Earth’s surface and erupts from a volcano, it is officially known as lava. The lava is observed as a red hot liquid spewing out of the cracks in the Earth’s crust. The term “lava” is derived from the Italian word label which translates to “slide” or “a fall.”.

What makes up the magma on the Earth?
-------------------------------------

Magma is a molten rock combined with solids and volatiles (chemicals that have low boiling points) that lies beneath Earth’s surface and is known to be present on some natural satellites and other planets as well. Magma may also contain dissolved gas, suspended crystals, and even gas bubbles, besides molten rock.
