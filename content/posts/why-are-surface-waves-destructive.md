Why are surface waves destructive?
----------------------------------

Surface waves are slower than body waves. Regardless of its wavelength each type of body waves travels at one velocity. It is the surface waves which cause most property damage because surface waves produce more ground movement and travel more slowly, so they take longer to pass.

Which type of surface wave is the most destructive?
---------------------------------------------------

L-waves  
Of the two types of surface waves, the L-waves are the most destructive. They can literally move the ground beneath a building faster than the building itself can respond, effectively shearing the base off of the rest of the building.

Which is more destructive surface waves or S waves?
---------------------------------------------------

Although surface waves travel more slowly than S-waves, they can be much larger in amplitude and can be the most destructive type of seismic wave. Rate! Rate! They are commonly created when the wellspring of the seismic tremor is near the Earth’s surface.

How are body wraves related to surface waves?
---------------------------------------------

The body wraves interact with the surface rocks and generate new set of waves called surface waves. These waves move along the surface. The velocity of waves changes as they travel through materials with different densities. The denser the material, the higher is the velocity.

What are the different types of seismic waves?
----------------------------------------------

Earthquakes: seismic waves. Seismic waves can be classified into two basic types: body waves which travel through the Earth and surface waves, which travel along the Earth’s surface. Those waves that are the most destructive are the surface waves which generally have the strongest vibration.

Where do surface waves come from in an earthquake?
--------------------------------------------------

Surface waves. Surface waves are typically generated when the source of the earthquake is close to the Earth’s surface. Surface waves are typically generated when the source of the earthquake is close to the Earth’s surface. As their name suggests, surface waves travel just below the surface of the ground.
