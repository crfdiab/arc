How did erosion affect the Mammoth Cave?
----------------------------------------

Erosion are weathering are an environmental team; weathering breaks up rock and sediments (either mechanically or chemically) and erosion carries those sediments to a new location. In the case of Mammoth Cave, water eroded sandstone, and chemically weathered limestone away until caves formed.

How are caves affected by erosion?
----------------------------------

Erosional caves are those formed by the action of water or wind, carrying abrasive particles capable of carving rock. Erosion tends to produce tall, canyon-like passages. Running water on glaciers may sink into crevasses and melt a path through the glacier to form glacier caves.

What type of erosion formed Mammoth Cave?
-----------------------------------------

Mammoth Cave National Park is known for housing the world’s longest cave system, with over 405 miles (651 km) mapped. The vast cavern system was formed by water slowly dissolving Mississippian-aged carbonate rocks, creating sinkholes, tunnels, and underground rivers.

Are caves made from weathering or erosion?
------------------------------------------

Introduction. There are several different types of caves, the most common being solution caves. These caves are formed by the dissolving of the rock along and adjacent to joints (fractures), faults, and layers in the rock. The processes involved are both chemical corrosion and physical erosion.

What three types of caves are caused by erosion?
------------------------------------------------

Talus Caves – Formed between boulders that have naturally fallen into a random heap on the top of a hill or mountain. Rock Shelters – Produced when the bedrock erosion takes place in insoluble rocks. Eolian Caves – Wind-carved caves that usually form in desert areas. Sea Caves – Formed by wave action along coastlines.

What is the difference between a cave and a cavern?
---------------------------------------------------

A cave is defined as any cavity in the ground that has a section which does not receive direct sunlight. A cavern is just one type of cave which is formed naturally in soluble rock and grows speleothems (the general term for cave formations like stalagmites and stalactites).

Why is the Mammoth Cave a mystery to scientists?
------------------------------------------------

Experts and scientists have no answer as to why this is, making it one of the greatest mysteries of Mammoth Cave to this day.

Where is the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky located?
----------------------------------------------

Mammoth Cave National Park is an American national park in central Kentucky, encompassing portions of Mammoth Cave, the longest cave system known in the world. Since the 1972 unification of Mammoth Cave with the even-longer system under Flint Ridge to the north, the official name of the system has been the Mammoth–Flint Ridge Cave System.

What is the average temperature at Mammoth Cave?
------------------------------------------------

According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Mammoth Cave National Park Visitor Center at 722 ft (220 m) elevation is 6b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -3.2 °F (-19.6 °C).

When was the Mammoth Cave National Park established?
----------------------------------------------------

Since the 1972 unification of Mammoth Cave with the even-longer system under Flint Ridge to the north, the official name of the system has been the Mammoth–Flint Ridge Cave System. The park was established as a national park on July 1, 1941, a World Heritage Site on October 27, 1981, and an international Biosphere Reserve on September 26, 1990.
