Is North 0 degrees on a compass?
--------------------------------

Compasses have four cardinal points: north (N), east (E), south (S), and west (W). Some compasses also display 360 marks called degrees that can be used instead of or in addition to the needle which always points north. North indicates 0° (0 degrees). 90 degrees is East, south is 180°, and west is 270°.

At what degree is East?
-----------------------

90 degrees  
If 0 degrees is North and 90 degrees is East, then 45 degrees is Northeast. This applies for every adjacent pair of directions, so the midpoint between East (90) and South (180) is Southeast at 135 degrees.
