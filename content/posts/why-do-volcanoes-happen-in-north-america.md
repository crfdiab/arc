Why do volcanoes happen in North America?
-----------------------------------------

Most volcanoes of Canda &amp; USA are located along the west coast and related to the subduction of the Pacific plate under the continental North American tectonic plate.

Are there volcanoes on the North American plate?
------------------------------------------------

The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was a vivid reminder that the continental US has active volcanoes, 169 of them. In Alaska, the Pacific Plate is subducting under the North American Plate, making the famously active string of volcanoes of the Aleutian Islands.

What plate would create the most volcanoes in North America?
------------------------------------------------------------

Pacific Rim The Pacific Ring of Fire is where the majority of the volcanic activity on the Earth occurs. A description of the Pacific Ring of Fire along western North America is a description of the plate boundaries. Subduction at the Middle American Trench creates volcanoes in Central America.

How are plate boundaries related to volcanic activity?
------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, the plates collide with one another or move apart. Volcanoes are most common in these geologically active boundaries. The two types of plate boundaries that are most likely to produce volcanic activity are divergent plate boundaries and convergent plate boundaries. At a divergent boundary, tectonic plates move apart from one another.

Is the North American Plate a large tectonic plate?
---------------------------------------------------

Large tectonic plate including most of North America, Greenland and a bit of Siberia. The North American Plate is a tectonic plate covering most of North America, Greenland, Cuba, the Bahamas, extreme northeastern Asia, and parts of Iceland and the Azores.

How are volcanoes connected to the surface of the Earth?
--------------------------------------------------------

All volcanoes are connected to a reservoir of molten rock, called a magma chamber, below the surface of the Earth. When pressure inside the chamber builds up, the buoyant magma travels out a surface vent or series of vents, through a central interior pipe or series of pipes.

How are the plates of the Earth’s crust broken up?
--------------------------------------------------

The Earth’s crust is broken up into a series of massive sections called plates. These tectonic plates rest upon the convecting mantle, which causes them to move. The movements of these plates can account for noticeable geologic events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and more subtle yet sublime events, like the building of mountains.
