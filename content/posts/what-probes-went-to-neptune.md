What probes went to Neptune?
----------------------------

NASA’s Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus and Neptune, in brief fly-bys in the 1980s.

What telescope can see Neptune?
-------------------------------

Neptune’s disk is visible at 200× through a 6-inch telescope on a night of steady seeing.

Can Hubble see Neptune?
-----------------------

Hubble Releases a New Image of Neptune, Revealing a Rapidly Shifting Storm. Observations a year later showed that it began drifting southward toward the equator, where previous similar whirling storms went to die. But recent observations with Hubble spotted the vortex doubling back to the north in August of 2020.

What was the name of the space probe that explored Neptune?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Neptune’s south pole is at the bottom of the image. Neptune has been directly explored by only one space probe, Voyager 2, in 1989. As of January 2021, there are no approved future missions to visit the Neptunian system.

What kind of telescopes are used to study Neptune?
--------------------------------------------------

Neptune has also been scientifically studied from afar with telescopes, primarily since the mid 1990s. This includes the Hubble Space Telescope but most importantly ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics. After having visited Saturn successfully, it was decided to continue and fund further missions by Voyager 2 to Uranus and Neptune.

How did Voyager 1 find out about Neptune?
-----------------------------------------

 Voyager returned a wealth of information about Neptune and its moons-and confirmed evidence the giant world had faint rings like the other gas planets. Scientists also use the Hubble Space Telescope and powerful ground-based telescopes to gather more information about this distant planet

Are there any plans to explore Neptune’s moons?
-----------------------------------------------

Two different proposals were put forward in 2005 for unmanned spacecraft to explore Neptune and its moons, especially Triton. These studies are part of NASA’s Vision Mission program to develop long-term space exploration goals.
