Do salt marshes slow down hurricanes?
-------------------------------------

Salt marshes mitigate storm surge, a destructive aspect of hurricanes, and represent a cost effective hurricanes defense solution compared to other solutions. Researchers found that by absorbing storm surge, wetlands avoided $625 million in direct flood property damages during Hurricane Sandy (Narayan et al, 2017).

How do salt marshes protect the land?
-------------------------------------

Although frequently ignored, salt marshes are unsung heroes. They help protect coastlines from storms, storm surges and erosion by creating a buffer between dry land and the sea, building up the height of the coast by trapping silt during floods and adding new soil from their decaying vegetation.

What are some reasons that marshes are important?
-------------------------------------------------

Both saltwater and freshwater tidal marshes serve many important functions: They buffer stormy seas, slow shoreline erosion, offer shelter and nesting sites for migratory water birds, and absorb excess nutrients that would lower oxygen levels in the sea and harm wildlife.

How can salt marshes help reduce storm surges?
----------------------------------------------

Study finds that natural flood defences such as salt marshes can reduce the height of damaging waves in storm surge conditions by close to 20%.

Why are salt marshes important to the ecosystem?
------------------------------------------------

Salt marshes have great ecological value for the ecosystem, namely in nutrient regeneration, primary production, habitat for wildlife species, and as shoreline stabilizers. Their important role has been recently confirmed by the inclusion of these ecosystems in the Water Framework Directive.

Where are the salt marshes in the UK?
-------------------------------------

As part of the government’s attempts to mitigate the effects of future storms, salt marshes have been re-created in several locations around the UK coast: a large new salt marsh on the Somerset’s Steart peninsula was recently completed, and several more are planned for locations throughout the UK.

How often does flooding occur in salt marshes?
----------------------------------------------

Higher marshes at sites with regular tides have variation between spring and neap tides that result in some areas being flooded every day while other, higher, areas are flooded less frequently. At higher elevations flooding may occur on only a few days each spring tide, while at the highest elevations flooding may occur only a few times a year.
