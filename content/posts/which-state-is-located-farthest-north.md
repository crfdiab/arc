Which state is located farthest north?
--------------------------------------

Farthest North. When looking at the entire US, it becomes pretty obvious which state is the farthest north: Alaska for the win. Point Barrow, Alaska, is the northernmost point, located at 71 degrees 23 minutes north.

Where can I find the furthest place on Earth?
---------------------------------------------

How about far away? How about as far away as possible? FurthestCity is a nifty little website that lets you know the farthest city from wherever you’re currently located. We really couldn’t help ourselves and looked up the farthest locations of some of the world’s major cities.

Which is the farthest north south east and west of the United States?

Quoddy Head is also the closest point in the US to Africa. Which States Are the Farthest North, South, East, and West? Despite the confusion and the different perspectives, you can simply this answer pretty easily. Alaska is the northernmost, easternmost, and westernmost state. Hawaii is the southernmost.

Which is the furthest point from land in the world?
---------------------------------------------------

But if you have decent sea legs, nothing beats the furthest point from land, also known as the “oceanic pole of inaccessibility”. Since its official title is a bit of a mouthful, it has been nicknamed Point Nemo, after author Jules Verne’s famous seafaring anti-hero Captain Nemo.

Which is the farthest east state in the United States?
------------------------------------------------------

This makes the question of which state is the farthest east much more obvious: The easternmost state is Maine at the West Quoddy Head lighthouse (66 degrees 57 minutes west.) The northernmost state is Alaska at Point Barrow (71 degrees 23 minutes north.)

Which is the farthest east west north and South?
------------------------------------------------

There is a way to say that one state is the farthest east, west, and north, but not south. We can say that Alaska has the points in the US that are farthest in three directions, but there is no way that it is farthest south. Alaska is clearly the state in the US that has the northernmost point.

Which is the farthest point in the United States?
-------------------------------------------------

The Farthest Points in the Entire United States. This places some of the islands in the Eastern Hemisphere and thus degrees east of Greenwich (and the prime meridian). This also means that by this definition, the point farthest to the east is right next to the point farthest to the west: literally, where east meets west.

Which is the northernmost state in the United States?
-----------------------------------------------------

Point Barrow, Alaska, is the northernmost point, located at 71 degrees 23 minutes north. It becomes less obvious, however, when you are just considering the 48 contiguous states. Look on a 2-D map, and you might be inclined to say Washington, or maybe even Maine. You have to pay attention to those lines of latitude though.

Which is the farthest state in the lower 48 states?
---------------------------------------------------

Farthest Points in the Lower 48 States If you’re considering only the 48 contiguous states, then we eliminate Alaska and Hawaii from the equation. The easternmost state is Maine, marked by the West Quoddy Head Lighthouse (66 degrees 57 minutes west.) The northernmost state is Minnesota at Angle Inlet (49 degrees 23 minutes north.)

Which is the farthest north south south and West?
-------------------------------------------------

Determining which state is the farthest north, south, east, and west in the United States depends on your perspective. Are you looking at all 50 states or just the lower 48 contiguous states? Are you considering the way it looks on a map or judging by the lines of latitude and longitude ?
