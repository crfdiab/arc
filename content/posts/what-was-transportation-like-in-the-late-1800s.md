What was transportation like in the late 1800s?
-----------------------------------------------

And soon caught people’s imagination. A huge rail network was constructed in the late 1800 and early 1900s – much of which is still around today to be admired. A very excellent book about life at the beginning of the 19th century is Georgette Heyer’s Regency World by Jennifer Kloester.

Why was the railroad so important in the 1800s?
-----------------------------------------------

Railroads proved to be an important transportation innovation in the 1800s, due to their ability to transport large quantities of people and goods at relatively high speeds. Rail travel has the advantage of working year-round, where boat travel can be difficult in northern climes during the winter.

What was the most popular form of Transportation in the US?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Boats also traveled along man-made canals which strengthened local economies. The American railroad system began. Many people did not believe train technology would work. In time, railroads became the most popular form of land transportation in the United States. In 19th-century American culture, railroads were more than just a way to travel.

How did transport work in Australia in the 1900’s?
--------------------------------------------------

Each capital city in Australia was connected by over 4000 kilometres of railway tracks by 1900. Rail travel, despite the investment made into making rail lines, was 50% cheaper than coach travel, meaning all classes could use them. A return train trip, travelling first class, from Sydney to Penrith was 60 cents ($3.00).

What kind of Transportation was used during the transportation revolution?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flatboats were commonly used until the 1830s when steamboats began to dominate river trade and travel on the Great Lakes. The advantages to this form of transportation were speed and economy, plus connections of internal waterways with major ports. (Transportation Revolution, p.56-73)

What did canals and railroads do in the 1800s?
----------------------------------------------

Waterways and a growing network of railroads linked the frontier with the eastern cities. Produce moved on small boats along canals and rivers from the farms to the ports. Large steamships carried goods and people from port to port. Railroads expanded to connect towns, providing faster transport for everyone.
