Are Diverging plates constructive?
----------------------------------

In plate tectonics, a divergent boundary or divergent plate boundary (also known as a constructive boundary or an extensional boundary) is a linear feature that exists between two tectonic plates that are moving away from each other.

Why is a divergent boundary also called a constructive boundary?
----------------------------------------------------------------

At a divergent plate boundary – also known as a constructive plate boundary, the plates move apart from one another. When this happens the magma from the mantle rises up to make (or construct) new crust. The movement of the plates over the mantle can cause earthquakes. Rising magma can also create shield volcanoes .

What types of plates are at convergent boundaries?
--------------------------------------------------

Convergent boundaries , where two plates are moving toward each other, are of three types, depending on the type of crust present on either side of the boundary — oceanic or continental . The types are ocean-ocean, ocean-continent, and continent-continent.

Can you tell if this plate boundary is divergent or convergent?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Divergent boundaries are boundaries where plates pull away from each other, forming mild earthquakes and volcanoes as magma comes to the surface. Convergent boundaries are boundaries where two plates are pushing into each other.

What are the advantages of divergent plate boundaries?
------------------------------------------------------

Divergent boundaries – where two plates are moving apart. The space created can also fill with new crustal material sourced from molten magma that forms below. Divergent boundaries can form within continents but will eventually open up and become ocean basins.

What happens to the plates at a constructive plate boundary?
------------------------------------------------------------

At a constructive plate boundary – also known as a divergent plate boundary – the plates are moving apart from one another. When this happens, the magma from the mantle rises up to make (or construct) a new crust. The movement of the plates over the mantle can cause earthquakes.

How are converging and diverging tectonic plates different?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The plates that come towards each other and form divergent boundary are called converging tectonic plates 1. The plates that move away from each other and form divergent boundary are called diverging tectonic plates. 2. In the event of two plates coming together they may either collide and crumble, or one may slide under the other.

Which is an example of a divergent plate boundary?
--------------------------------------------------

Plate Boundaries: Divergent, Convergent, and Transform. Molten rock from the mantle erupts along the opening, forming new crust. The earthquakes that occur along these zones, called spreading centers, are relatively small. The Great Rift Valley in Africa, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden all formed as a result of divergent plate motion.

How are transform plates different from conservative plates?
------------------------------------------------------------

Transform boundary plates slide across each other. Lastly, conservative (transform) plate boundaries don’t collide into each other nor pull apart. Instead transform plates slide across from each other. We find most transform plates in the ocean basin connecting at mid-ocean ridges.
