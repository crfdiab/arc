2. 1) Cirro-: curl of hair, high.

Which is a collective term for a cloud?
---------------------------------------

One possible collective term is a “scud” of clouds – meaning fast-moving, loose, vapoury clouds. I’m sure many more exist – I will edit if I think of them. There’s no consensus, but The Collective Nouns Page gives us a souffle of clouds.

What kind of clouds are found in the atmosphere?
------------------------------------------------

Clouds are classified into three main groups: cirrus, stratus, and cumulus. Cirrus clouds are wispy, curly, or stringy. They are found high in the atmosphere—typically higher than 6,000 meters (20,000 feet)—and are usually made of ice crystals.

What kind of noun is cloud?
---------------------------

A collective noun for “clouds” would consist of one word or perhaps a compound word as “the cloud-cover” or “the cloud-covering” – don’t know whether these words are in the dictionary. I don’t think that there is a collective word for clouds. You could invent a word, perhaps “the clouding”.

What do clouds that are close to the ground mean?
-------------------------------------------------

Clouds located close to the ground mean heavy snow or rain. Clouds are also classified according to how high they are in the atmosphere and what kind of weather they produce. The prefix “cirro-” refers to clouds that lie more than 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) above the Earth.
