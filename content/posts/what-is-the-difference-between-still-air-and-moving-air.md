What is the difference between still air and moving air?
--------------------------------------------------------

A: Moving air is in motion, so its particles are speedier than still air. Fast air also has lower pressure than slow air thanks to Bernoulli’s principle.

What is mean by still air?
--------------------------

IN GENERAL, “still air” means air with no wind and no vertical air motion.

Does air stop moving?
---------------------

Once air is moving with the Earth it’s got momentum, and that’s what keeps it moving (or “what keeps it still”, if you happen to live on Earth). It turns out that the overwhelming majority of the movement of the atmosphere is tied up in rotating with (and so sitting still relative to) the Earth.

Does air move on its own?
-------------------------

Originally Answered: How does air move? Essentially, air moves in 2 ways (in a very basic explanation): Up and down, as air is heated and rises, or cooled and falls. Across, as air moves from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area.

Why does blowing air get colder?
--------------------------------

When you blow a narrow stream of air out of your mouth, ambient air is dragged along with it. This mixture of breath and ambient air feels cold. When you breath with a wide open mouth, the air stream is much wider (and slower) and doesn’t grab as much ambient air.

Why is fast air cooler?
-----------------------

The faster air moves, the lower pressure it has (Bernoulli’s principle). So when you blow faster, your stream of air is lower pressure than the surrounding air. Thus the surrounding air fills in the stream. The surrounding air is obviously cooler than the air in your lungs.

How will still air affect transpiration?
----------------------------------------

When the air is still or there is no wind, humidity may buildup around the plant from transpiration eventually decreasing the amount of water being released. When there is wind present, this causes the air to be replaced constantly allowing the plant to transpire. Increased humidity has a reduces transpiration.

What is the meaning of up in the air in idioms?
-----------------------------------------------

Anything that’s up in the air is uncertain or iffy. Are your birthday plans up in the air? That means you haven’t decided yet what you’ll do to celebrate. Use the phrase up in the air to talk about something that’s undecided or unresolved.

Does air move like water?
-------------------------

While air can be compressed more easily than water, freely flowing air acts much like water—at least at relatively low speeds. So when you “squeeze” a stream of air, two things happen. The air speeds up, and as it speeds up, its pressure—the force of the air pressing against the side of the object—goes down.

Why does the air feel spicy?
----------------------------

It does so by circulating blood near the surface of the skin, by exhaling warm, humidified air, and by evaporating sweat. Anything that interferes with this vaporization of water (humid air, lack of a breeze, heavy clothing, and so on) makes us feel especially hot and uncomfortable.

Is there such a thing as still air?
-----------------------------------

However there are other cases in the FAR’s where it might matter. IN GENERAL, “still air” means air with no wind and no vertical air motion. – quiet flyer May 8 ’19 at 20:01 As far as I’m aware (and I’m pretty confident) there are no regulations that require vertical air motion to be considered for any flight planning purpose for powered aircraft.

Why does moving air feel colder than stagnant air?
--------------------------------------------------

This make you feel blowing air colder rather than warmer. Also the reason why you feel stagnant air hot is that hottest molecules of stagnant air remain in contact with your skin in free convection mode of heat transfer. The premise is wrong that moving air feels colder in general. It is applicable for temperatures up until about body temperature.

How does an airplane stay in the air?
-------------------------------------

To stay in the air and sustain its flight, an aircraft needs to be moving forward. Since lift is produced when the wing forces the air above to speed up, the wings needs to be moving through the air, gathering speed, to keep producing lift.

Can you teach how does air make things move?
--------------------------------------------

How does air make things move? is a stand-alone task. However, it can be taught as part of an instructional sequence in which students coherently build ownership of science ideas about what pushes and pulls can do.
