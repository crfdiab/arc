How fast do planes fly mph?
---------------------------

around 460-575 mph  
Most commercial aircraft typically fly at around 460-575 mph, or 740-930 km/h, according to Flight Deck Friend. But private jet speed can vary depending on a variety of factors, such as the weight onboard and the weather conditions.

How fast do planes take off?
----------------------------

Typical takeoff air speeds for jetliners are in the range of 240–285 km/h (130–154 kn; 149–177 mph). Light aircraft, such as a Cessna 150, take off at around 100 km/h (54 kn; 62 mph). Ultralights have even lower takeoff speeds.

Can a plane fly at 1000 mph?
----------------------------

The world’s fastest manned plane is the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. The Tupolev has held that record since 1960, even though another prop plane, the XF-84H Thunderscreech, was designed to fly at about 1,000 mph (1,609 kph).

What is the most dangerous time on a plane?
-------------------------------------------

Boeing research shows that takeoff and landing are statistically more dangerous than any other part of a flight. 49% of all fatal accidents happen during the final descent and landing phases of the average flight, while 14% of all fatal accidents happen during takeoff and initial climb.

What is the average speed of a plane?
-------------------------------------

The most common cruising speed of a passenger aircraft is about 547-575mph. Yet as you might already know, this isn’t the speed of the plane at takeoff or landing, and the plane speed is set to fluctuate depending on a multitude of extenuating factors. When you think of something traveling in “miles per hour,” you think of a car with wheels.

What’s the average speed of a commercial jet?
---------------------------------------------

The average cruising flight speed for commercial jets is around 540 mph. This is based on the most popular commercial jets in operation, the Boeing 747 family. Some models of jets have been designed to reach much higher speeds than the average of 550 mph. Typically, these planes are designed for a limited number of passengers.

Which is the fastest plane in the world?
----------------------------------------

What is the fastest plane in the world today? The fastest plane in the world today is the North American X-15. It recorded a maximum speed of Mach 6.7. The plane was flying at about 4,500 miles per hour or about 7,200 km per hour.

Which is faster a plane or a jet engine?
----------------------------------------

Most passenger airplanes have a very similar range of speed, while jet engines can fly at higher maximum speeds. Check out the below chart that shows the most common airline passenger planes and their speeds in miles per hour.
