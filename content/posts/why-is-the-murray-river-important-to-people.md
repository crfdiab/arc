Why is the Murray river important to people?
--------------------------------------------

More than 3 million Australians rely on the Murray-Darling Basin rivers for drinking water, including Canberra and Adelaide. Home to more than 40 Aboriginal Nations with deep cultural, social, environmental, spiritual and economic connection to their lands and waters.

What are the main uses of the Murray river to the people?
---------------------------------------------------------

A total of 3.6 million people (including the entire population of Adelaide which is not in the Basin) rely on water from the Basin rivers for many uses, including drinking, washing, farming and irrigation.

How has the Murray river been used to transport people?
-------------------------------------------------------

Aboriginal peoples have had a strong connection with the River Murray for over 40 000 years. In the 1850s the River Murray was an important trade route, with paddle steamers transporting goods to settlers and miners along the length of the river, and exporting wool, wheat, hides, salt and oats. …

How does the Murray river help farmers?
---------------------------------------

As Australia’s most important agricultural region, the Basin produces one third of Australia’s food supply and supports over a third of Australia’s total gross value of agricultural production. Three quarters of Australia’s irrigated crops and pastures are grown in the Basin.

What would happen if the Murray River dried up?
-----------------------------------------------

The effects of drought in the Murray–Darling Basin A drought will also affect different elements of the river system differently. For example, a dry year will mean farms that aren’t irrigated (dryland farms) will produce less than in a normal year. When this happens, water shortages affect the whole river system.

What makes the Murray River unique?
-----------------------------------

It’s one of the longest navigable rivers in the world It’s 2508 kilometres long, spanning New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Almost 2000 km is navigable, making it the third longest navigable river on the planet, with only the Amazon and Nile rivers ahead of it.

Can you drink Murray River water?
---------------------------------

It is recommended not to drink water from the River Murray at any time unless it is treated. The water quality challenges presented by blackwater can be effectively treated via SA Water’s treatment processes and therefore do not currently pose a drinking water quality issue.

How do farmers get water from the Murray River?
-----------------------------------------------

Irrigation is the largest user of water from the River Murray system. An annual average of approximately 3,780 GL is currently diverted from rivers under Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) control to irrigate a total area of 470,000 ha.

Why is there so much water in the River Murray?
-----------------------------------------------

Late in 2016, thanks to a very wet winter, the river experienced what are known as high flows. The extra rainfall increased the amount of water coming down the river, which was great news for many, although some shacks and river properties were inundated with water. .

How does the Murray Darling basin affect the environment?
---------------------------------------------------------

Lower river flows can cause major environmental problems such as salinity, algae outbreaks, loss of native animals (due to destruction of breeding spots and food resources), and loss of vegetation (which has further impacts on water quality and native species).

When was the Millennium drought on the River Murray?
----------------------------------------------------

In earlier years, before dams were built along the river, dry times and drought meant the river could be reduced to a few pools, and sometimes the flow would stop altogether. While the Millennium Drought broke in 2010, we are still dealing with the effects.

Why did they build the weirs on the River Murray?
-------------------------------------------------

As the use of irrigation in farming increased along the river, so did the amount of water being taken from the river. After the River Murray Commission was established in 1917, structures known as weirs and locks were built along the river to help manage the water that was being taken. The weirs help to: store water and regulate river flow
