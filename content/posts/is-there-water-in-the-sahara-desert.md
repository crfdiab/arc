Is there water in the Sahara desert?
------------------------------------

Although water is scarce across the entire region, the Sahara contains two permanent rivers (the Nile and the Niger), at least 20 seasonal lakes and huge aquifers, which are the primary sources of water in the more than 90 major desert oases.

What region of Africa is covered by a desert where very few plants grow?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In parts of the Sahara, plants cannot take root at all. In the southern Libyan Desert, for instance, no greenery exists for more than 195 kilometers (120 miles). The Sahel is a narrow band of semi-arid land that forms a transition zone between the Sahara to the north and the savannas to the south.

How do Arizona deserts get water?
---------------------------------

If you’re ever lost in a desert, knowing how to quickly find water is key to your survival. Water flows down, so check low terrain. Canyons and mountain bases could be home to a water source. Fruits, vegetables, cacti, and roots all contain water and mashing them with a rock will release some liquid.

Where are the deserts located in South Africa?
----------------------------------------------

Stretching along the Atlantic coastal region of Southern Africa the desert covers parts of Angola, Namibia, and South Africa, and merges with the Kalahari Desert in the south. The climate is extremely arid due to interactions between the dry Namib winds and the Atlantic’s Benguela current.

Where does the water in the Sahara Desert come from?
----------------------------------------------------

Other water in the Sahara is found in underground aquifers and in areas where this water reaches the surface, there are oases and sometimes small towns or settlements like the Bahariya Oasis in Egypt and Ghardaïa in Algeria.

Are there any permanent water sources in the Kalahari Desert?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Large sections of the desert feature vast areas of red sand lacking any permanent water source. The Okavango River is the only permanent river flowing through the desert. Large salt pans like Namibia’s Etosha Pan and Botswana’s Makgadikgadi Pan are part of the Kalahari Desert.
