What is the shallow part of the ocean called?
---------------------------------------------

The continental shelf is an area of relatively shallow water, usually less than a few hundred feet deep, that surrounds land.

What do you call the areas of shallow seabed close to the shore?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The continental crust is the layer of granitic, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks which form the continents and the areas of shallow seabed close to their shores, known as continental shelves.

What part of the ocean is most shallow?
---------------------------------------

Arctic Ocean  
Of the five major oceans of the world, the Arctic Ocean ranks as the smallest and shallowest. The International Hydrographic Organization includes it as an ocean, but a section of oceanographers recognize it as an estuary or a mediterranean sea of the Atlantic Ocean.

What are the two types of crust and its properties?
---------------------------------------------------

Earth’s Crust There are two different types of crust: thin oceanic crust that underlies the ocean basins, and thicker continental crust that underlies the continents. These two different types of crust are made up of different types of rock.

Where are some shallow areas of the ocean?
------------------------------------------

I can recall several surveys where we encountered very shallow offshore features in otherwise deep water. To the north of Mitrofania Island, out near the Aleutian Chain, there is a rock with a least depth of 20-ft in the middle of 23-ftm (140-ft) of water and a rock awash with 28-ftm (160-ft) surrounding it.

Which is the surface layer of the ocean?
----------------------------------------

Image copyright Sea and Sky. Epipelagic Zone – The surface layer of the ocean is known as the epipelagic zone and extends from the surface to 200 meters (656 feet). It is also known as the sunlight zone because this is where most of the visible light exists. With the light come heat.

Is the continental shelf the deepest part of the ocean?
-------------------------------------------------------

The width of the shelf varies around the edges of the continents. Sometimes, the continental shelf can be very shallow, or it can be very deep. This is not the deepest part of the ocean, though!

What makes up the bottom of the ocean?
--------------------------------------

Continental Slope – The steep slope where the contintental shelf drops to the bottom of the ocean floor. This is where the water in the ocean starts to get really deep! Mid-Ocean Ridge – On the bottom of the ocean, there is a central ridge, or mountain range, that divides the ocean floor into two parts.
