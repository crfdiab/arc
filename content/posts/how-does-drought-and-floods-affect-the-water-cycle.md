How does drought and floods affect the water cycle?
---------------------------------------------------

A main contributor to the intensity of a drought or flooding event is how much water vapor can be held in the atmosphere. This accelerated, imbalanced water cycle can lead to more frequent and heavier bouts of extreme precipitation for some regions while leaving others dry.

How are we affecting the water cycle?
-------------------------------------

A number of human activities can impact on the water cycle: damming rivers for hydroelectricity, using water for farming, deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels.

Which change in the water cycle is the most likely cause of a drought?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As average temperatures rise due to climate change, the Earth’s water cycle accelerates through an increased evaporation rate. As an increased evaporation rate makes more water available in the air for precipitation, it also contributes to drier land areas, leaving less moisture in the soil.

Why is the water cycle affected by seasons?
-------------------------------------------

In parts of the Northern Hemisphere, an earlier arrival of spring-like conditions is leading to earlier peaks in snowmelt and resulting river flows. As a consequence, seasons with the highest water demand, typically summer and fall, are being impacted by a reduced availability of fresh water.

What is water cycle important to other animals?
-----------------------------------------------

The hydrologic cycle is important because it is how water reaches plants, animals and us! Besides providing people, animals and plants with water, it also moves things like nutrients, pathogens and sediment in and out of aquatic ecosystems.

Can water cycle affect weather?
-------------------------------

The cycling of liquid water and returning vapor creates our climate and our living environment. Dry soils short circuit the evaporation and transpiration stages of the water cycle. Without ongoing evaporation and transpiration, rainfall diminishes and deserts are gradually increase, changing the climate worldwide.

How is the water cycle disrupted in a drought?
----------------------------------------------

Moisture can travel very long distances before encountering such a forcing mechanism. In the case of a drought (water shortage), the large-scale atmospheric flow pattern is “locked” in place such that storm systems and their forcing mechanisms are absent over the drought region.

What happens to groundwater levels during a drought?
----------------------------------------------------

Groundwater levels first are dependent on recharge from infiltration of precipitation so when a drought hits the land surface it can impact the water levels below ground, too. Likewise, many aquifers, especially those which don’t have abundant recharge, are affected by the amount of water being pumped out of local wells.

How is the drought affecting the United States?
-----------------------------------------------

The current drought conditions have led to massive drops in lake levels throughout the western US, most notably in Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Drought conditions have led to increased wildfires in the western US and the need to rely on deep underground aquifers for water.

Is it normal for a period of drought?
-------------------------------------

It is not unusual for a given period of water deficiency to represent a more severe drought of one type than another type.
