Which layer of the Earth forms continents?
------------------------------------------

Continental crust  
Continental crust, the outermost layer of Earth’s lithosphere that makes up the planet’s continents and continental shelves and is formed near subduction zones at plate boundaries between continental and oceanic tectonic plates. The continental crust forms nearly all of Earth’s land surface.

What is the thickest thing on earth?
------------------------------------

The Earth can be divided into four main layers: the solid crust on the outside, the mantle, the outer core and the inner core. Out of them, the mantle is the thickest layer, while the crust is the thinnest layer.

What makes up the three layers of the Earth?
--------------------------------------------

Different Layers of the Earth. 1 The Inner Core. It is the centre and the hottest layer of the Earth. The inner core is solid and made up of iron and nickel with temperature up to 2 The Outer Core. 3 Mantle. 4 Crust. The crust is the outer layer where we live. The thickness is around 0-60 km. It’s a solid rock layer divided into two types:

Which is the outermost layer of the Earth?
------------------------------------------

crust (in geology) Earth’s outermost surface, usually made from dense, solid rock. crystal (adj. crystalline) A solid consisting of a symmetrical, ordered, three-dimensional arrangement of atoms or molecules.

How many continents are there and how many oceans are there?
------------------------------------------------------------

Let us learn about each of these seven continents and five oceans that make up our planet earth. Continents are the large land masses that we see on our earth. These hard land masses where people and other living organisms walk or crawl and make home are large in size, and are made up of many countries.

What makes up the mantle layer of the Earth?
--------------------------------------------

The mantle consists of very hot and dense rock. This layer of rock flows like asphalt under heavy weight. This flow is because of the greatest temperature differences from the bottom to the top of the mantle. The reason behind the plates of the Earth move is the movement of the mantle.
