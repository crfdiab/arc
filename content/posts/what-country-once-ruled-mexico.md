What country once ruled Mexico?
-------------------------------

While Mexico remained a colony, rulers that governed Mexico came from mainland Spain. However, both native Mexicans and Creoles (people of Spanish descent born in Mexico) were unhappy with this system. They wanted to govern the country themselves.

What countries settled Mexico?
------------------------------

Colonial Mexico was part of the Spanish Empire and administered by the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Spanish crown claimed all of the Western Hemisphere west of the line established between Spain and Portugal by the Treaty of Tordesillas. This included all of North America and South America, except for Brazil.

What was Mexico formerly known as?
----------------------------------

After gaining independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico officially became the “United Mexican States.” The American independence movement had inspired Mexican leaders of that era and since Mexico, in fact, also was a territory composed of states, the name stuck and became official in 1824.

Which country belongs to Mexico?
--------------------------------

Mexico, country of southern North America and the third largest country in Latin America, after Brazil and Argentina.

Why is Mexico the only country in Latin America?
------------------------------------------------

Mexico is the only country in Latin America that borders an English-speaking country (the United States). Because of this, Mexico has a unique political and cultural position. The US and Mexico exchange aspects of language, food, and pop culture. The issue of immigration gives Mexico a political identity all its own.

When did Mexico become part of the Spanish Empire?
--------------------------------------------------

From 1521, the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire incorporated the region into the Spanish empire, with New Spain its colonial era name and Mexico City the center of colonial rule.

How often did the government change in Mexico?
----------------------------------------------

From 1821 to 1877, there were two emperors, several dictators, and enough presidents and provisional executives to make a new government on the average of every nine months.

Who was the dictator of Mexico in 1877?
---------------------------------------

The years after the fall of the dictator Porfirio Diaz (1877?1880 and 1884?1911) were marked by bloody political-military strife and trouble with the U.S., culminating in the punitive U.S. expedition into northern Mexico (1916?1917) in unsuccessful pursuit of the revolutionary Pancho Villa.
