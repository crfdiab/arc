How did salt originally get in the oceans?
------------------------------------------

In the beginning, the primeval seas were probably only slightly salty. But over time, as rain fell to the Earth and ran over the land, breaking up rocks and transporting their minerals to the ocean, the ocean has become saltier. Rain replenishes freshwater in rivers and streams, so they donâ€™t taste salty.

What are three ways salt accumulates in the ocean?
--------------------------------------------------

Rain, Erosion and Evaporation This salt solution flowing through streams and rivers, ultimately end up in seas and oceans which are essentially reservoirs. Sources of salt in the ocean. Figure: Why is the Ocean Salty?, USGS, public domain.

Where does the salt in the sea come from?
-----------------------------------------

The salt in the seas comes from rain running on top of rocks, such as mountains, and carrying the minerals, which contain salt, with them into the sea. In rivers, the water runs continuously and the minerals are carried away into the open ocean (which is why the sea is salty).

How are the seas and oceans getting saltier?
--------------------------------------------

Thanks to rainfall they are getting saltier by the day. Rain falling on rocks washes the surface off a tiny bit at a time (over millions of years) through the process of erosion dissolving mineral salts of the rock surfaces. This salt solution flowing through streams and rivers, ultimately end up in seas and oceans which are essentially reservoirs.

What happens to sea salt when it evaporates?
--------------------------------------------

The sun evaporates the water. As the water vaporizes, the salt remains behind, creating ever-more saline water. Eventually enough of the water evaporates to leave behind a layer of sea salt crystals that can be harvested.

Why is the water in the Dead Sea salty?
---------------------------------------

In rivers, the water runs continuously and the minerals are carried away into the open ocean (which is why the sea is salty). In closed lakes, like the Dead Sea, the water can not escape into the ocean and the minerals/salt build up. With the dead sea, I think it filled with ocean water or Mediterranean sea water, which was once ocean water.
