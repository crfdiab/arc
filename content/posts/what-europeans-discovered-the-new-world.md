How did Europe encounter the New World?
---------------------------------------

In 1492, Christopher Columbus, supported by the Spanish government, undertook a voyage to find a new route to Asia and inadvertently encountered “new” lands in the Americas full of long established communities and cultures. Other European countries quickly followed suit and began to explore and invade the New World.

Did Europeans bring to the New World?
-------------------------------------

The Europeans brought technologies, ideas, plants, and animals that were new to America and would transform peoples’ lives: guns, iron tools, and weapons; Christianity and Roman law; sugarcane and wheat; horses and cattle.

What 2 European countries had the most impact on the new world?
---------------------------------------------------------------

England was not the most powerful European nation in the 16th century. Spain was most influential. Along with Portugal, Spain dominated New World exploration in the decades that followed Columbus. France, the Netherlands, and Sweden all showed greater interest in the Western Hemisphere than England did.

Why did the Europeans come to the New World?
--------------------------------------------

Few people in the 1400s had traveled far from Europe. Then, in 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed to North America. Other explorers followed. They used special navigation tools to help them cross the ocean. They brought back things of value.

What was the discovery of the New World?
----------------------------------------

Discovery of the New World. The Treaties of Tordesillas and Saragossa in 1494 and 1529 defined the limits of westward Spanish exploration and the eastern ventures of Portugal. The two states acting as the vanguard of the expansion of Europe had thus divided the newly discovered sea lanes of the world between them.
