What is cold cloud precipitation?
---------------------------------

In cold clouds ice crystals and water droplets exist side by side. Due to an imbalance of water vapor pressure, the water droplets transfer to the ice crystals. The crystals eventually grow heavy enough to fall to earth. There is no difference between fog and clouds other than altitude.

What causes a cloud to produce precipitation?
---------------------------------------------

Clouds are the visible result of that squeeze of cooler, moist air. Moist air becomes cloudy with only slight cooling. With further cooling, the water or ice particles that make up the cloud can grow into bigger particles that fall to Earth as precipitation.

What role do clouds play in climate change?
-------------------------------------------

Clouds play an important role in both warming and cooling our planet. Clouds give us a cooler climate on Earth than we would enjoy without clouds. But it’s a bit complicated: Clouds can both cool down and warm up the temperatures on Earth. Clouds can block light and heat from the Sun, making Earth’s temperature cooler.

What are the causes of precipitation and clouds?
------------------------------------------------

Precipitation and Clouds, Formation of. Clouds are condensed droplets or ice crystals from atmospheric water vapor. Clouds form by the rising and cooling of air caused by convection, topography, convergence, and frontal lifting.

Where does most precipitation in the sky come from?
---------------------------------------------------

Precipitation elements begin to form in the part of the cloud where ice crystals and cloud droplets coexist. Most precipitation starts out as snow, except for rain that comes out of very low clouds.

Which is an example of a net cooling effect?
--------------------------------------------

For example: Stratus clouds: A thick, low grey blanket, stratus clouds block sunlight from reaching the Earth like an umbrella and thus have a net cooling effect. Cirrus clouds: Wispy high clouds as much as 20 kilometers above the Earth’s surface, cirrus clouds let most sunlight pass through but may trap heat from getting out of the Earth system.

How does a downdraft affect the formation of a cloud?
-----------------------------------------------------

The particles drag some of the air along with them, creating a downdraft, as shown in part (b) of the figure. As the updraft pulls more dry air into the cloud, some of the raindrops evaporate, and the air cools, making it colder and heavier than the surrounding air. This usually strengthens the downdraft.
