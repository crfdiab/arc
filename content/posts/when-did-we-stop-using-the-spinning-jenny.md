When did we stop using the spinning jenny?
------------------------------------------

This invention greatly improved the speed and and quality of cloth in the 17 hundreds. Subsequently, question is, when did the spinning jenny stop being used? However, not much time passed until a new machine was introduced: in 1810, Spinning Jenny was replaced by the spinning mule (Bellis 2018).

Why did people stop using the spinning jenny?
---------------------------------------------

Hargreaves started selling the machines to the local population, however, ‘since each machine was capable of doing the work of wight people, other spinners became angry about the competition’. As a consequence, machines were destroyed with the intention of hindering the replacement of workers with machines.

What has replaced the spinning jenny?
-------------------------------------

It continued in common use in the cotton and fustian industry until about 1810. The spinning jenny was superseded by the spinning mule.

Did the spinning jenny change its purpose?
------------------------------------------

The spinning jenny allowed more threads and yarns to be produced by fewer spinners. The early spinning jenny also produced a weaker thread than could be produced by hand so there was a decrease in quality until improvements were made to the machines and a dependable power source became available.

How many threads could the spinning jenny spin at once?
-------------------------------------------------------

eight threads  
James Hargreaves’ ‘Spinning Jenny’, the patent for which is shown here, would revolutionise the process of cotton spinning. The machine used eight spindles onto which the thread was spun, so by turning a single wheel, the operator could now spin eight threads at once.

What were the long term effects of the spinning jenny?
------------------------------------------------------

The main advantage of Hargreaves’ Spinning Jenny was that it could spin several threads at once. One of the disadvantages of Hargreaves’ machine was that it was more expensive than the traditional spinning-wheel. In the long-term the Spinning-Jenny also resulted in some spinners becoming unemployed.

How old are spinning wheels?
----------------------------

Spinning wheels are believed to have originated in India between 500 and 1000 A.D. By the 13th century, they were seen in Europe and were a standard piece of equipment for those making fiber into yarn.

Why is the spinning jenny so important today?
---------------------------------------------

Click to see full answer. Herein, why is the spinning jenny important today? In 1764, a British carpenter and weaver named James Hargreaves invented an improved spinning jenny, a hand-powered multiple spinning machine that was the first machine to improve upon the Spinning Wheel.

How many spindles did Hargreaves Spinning Jenny have?
-----------------------------------------------------

Spinning wheels before Hargreaves had one spindle. (Similar wheels are still used today in the hobby industry.) Hargreaves’ original spinning jenny was hand-driven and had eight spindles. A single wheel on the spinning jenny controlled eight spindles which created a weave using eight threads spun from a corresponding set of rovings.

Who was the inventor of the spinning wheel?
-------------------------------------------

The Spinning Jenny was invented in 1764 by the carpenter and weaver James Hargreaves. Born in Oswaldtwistle in England in 1720, Hargreaves had no formal education and was never taught how to read or write. He named his invention after his wife Jenny. Spinning wheels before Hargreaves had one spindle.

What was the impact of the invention of Jenny?
----------------------------------------------

Before the invention of Jenny, the spinning of wool would take up an incredibly long amount of time. When the machine was first introduced, it caused much upheaval amongst the part of the worker’s part of the population.
