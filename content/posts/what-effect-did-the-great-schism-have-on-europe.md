What effect did the Great Schism have on Europe?
------------------------------------------------

How did the Great Schism (1378 –1417) help bring an end to the Middle Ages in Western Europe? It greatly weakened the power and prestige of the Roman Catholic Church. It prevented the Papacy from being moved from Rome to Avignon, France. Almost one third of the population of Western Europe died from The Black Death.

What is the main cause of the Great Schism?
-------------------------------------------

The Great Schism came about due to a complex mix of religious disagreements and political conflicts. One of the many religious disagreements between the western (Roman) and eastern (Byzantine) branches of the church had to do with whether or not it was acceptable to use unleavened bread for the sacrament of communion.

What was the cause of the Great Schism of 1054?
-----------------------------------------------

The Great Schism of 1054 The Great Schism was the division of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church during the middle ages. The split occurred in 1054 due to doctrinal, theological, linguistic, political and geographical reasons.

Who was the pope at the time of the Great Schism?
-------------------------------------------------

In the years leading up to the Great Schism, the church in the East was led by the Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Cerularius (circa 1000–1058), while the church in Rome was led by Pope Leo IX (1002–1054). At the time, problems sprang up in Southern Italy, which was part of the Byzantine Empire.

Why was the schism between Rome and Constantinople so bad?
----------------------------------------------------------

These religious disagreements were made worse by a variety of political conflicts, particularly regarding the power of Rome. Rome believed that the pope —the religious leader of the western church—should have authority over the patriarch—the religious authority of the eastern church. Constantinople disagreed.

What was the controversy of the East-West Schism?
-------------------------------------------------

Filioque Clause Controversy The filioque clause controversy ignited one of the most critical arguments of the East-West Schism. This dispute centered around the Trinity doctrine and whether the Holy Spirit proceeds from God the Father alone or from both the Father and the Son. Filioque is a Latin term meaning “and the son.”
