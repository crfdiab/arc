What is a large ancient landmass that consisted of all the continents on Earth?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pangea, also spelled Pangaea, in early geologic time, a supercontinent that incorporated almost all the landmasses on Earth.

What is the large ancient landmass?
-----------------------------------

About 300 million years ago, Earth didn’t have seven continents, but instead one massive supercontinent called Pangaea, which was surrounded by a single ocean called Panthalassa.

What was the original landmass of the Earth called?
---------------------------------------------------

Pangaea  
Pangaea or Pangea ( /pænˈdʒiːə/) was a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras. It assembled from earlier continental units approximately 335 million years ago, and began to break apart about 175 million years ago.

What was the name of the supercontinent that formed all the continents?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

He expanded upon his hypothesis in his 1915 book The Origin of Continents and Oceans ( Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane ), in which he postulated that, before breaking up and drifting to their present locations, all the continents had formed a single supercontinent that he called the ” Urkontinent “.

What was the distribution of continental mass in Pangaea?
---------------------------------------------------------

In contrast to the present Earth and its distribution of continental mass, much of Pangaea was in the Southern Hemisphere and surrounded by a superocean, Panthalassa. Pangaea was the most recent supercontinent to have existed and the first to be reconstructed by geologists.

What was the name of the landmass formed by the Ordovician collision?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Baltica, Laurentia, and Avalonia all came together by the end of the Ordovician to form a landmass called Euramerica or Laurussia, closing the Iapetus Ocean. The collision also resulted in the formation of the northern Appalachians. Siberia sat near Euramerica, with the Khanty Ocean between the two continents.

Who was the originator of the theory of continental drift?
----------------------------------------------------------

The concept that the continents once formed a contiguous land mass was hypothesised by, with corroborating evidence, Alfred Wegener, the originator of the scientific theory of continental drift, in his 1912 publication The Origin of Continents ( Die Entstehung der Kontinente ).
