What determines moonrise and moonset?
-------------------------------------

The moon’s position relative to the earth and the sun determines the moonrise and moonset time. For example, a last quarter rises at midnight and sets at noon. A waning gibbous is best seen from late night to early morning.

What causes a moonset?
----------------------

Rather, the Moon rises and sets, moving along an approximate east-to-west path each day, similar to the Sun’s apparent movement in the sky. Each day, the Moon moves about 13 degrees along its nearly circular orbit. The incremental movement causes daily moonrise and moonset locations to shift eastward.

Why does the Moon rise and set?
-------------------------------

The moon rises in the east and sets in the west, each and every day. It has to. The rising and setting of all celestial objects is due to Earth’s continuous daily spin beneath the sky.

What is the difference between moonset and moonrise?
----------------------------------------------------

As nouns the difference between moonrise and moonset is that moonrise is the time of day or night when the moon begins to rise over the horizon while moonset is the setting of the moon below the horizon.

How long does it take between moonset and moonrise?
---------------------------------------------------

Because the Moon is constantly in motion, the time span from one moonrise or moonset to the next is a little longer than 24 hours.

How long does a day last on the Moon?
-------------------------------------

29.5306 Earth days  
A mean solar day on the Moon, a lunar day for short, is 29.5306 Earth days. Local lunar days can vary even more than solar days on Earth, over 6 hours shorter or 7 hours longer than the mean.

Why does the moon rise at different times each night?
-----------------------------------------------------

The Moon also doesn’t rise at the same time each night. Due to the speed of Earth’s rotation and the Moon’s orbit, the Moon rises about 50 minutes later each day. Interestingly, all these changes in relative position to the Sun make the Moon appear to go through its waxing and waning phases.

How does the position of moonrise and moonset change?
-----------------------------------------------------

Here is a table summarizing that: Moon phase Moonrise Moonset New Sunrise Sunset 1st quarter Local noon Local midnight Full Sunset Sunrise 3rd quarter Local midnight Local noon

Where can I find the date and time of the next moonrise?
--------------------------------------------------------

The date and time of the next New Moon and the next Full Moon can also be found near the top of the page, along with the date and time of the next moonrise or moonset. Note that the Moon may not be visible in the selected location at the time it reaches each Moon phase.

Why does the Moon have a stronger tidal effect than the Sun?
------------------------------------------------------------

Because the Moon is so much closer to our planet than the Sun, the tidal effect of the Moon on Earth is more than twice as strong as that of the Sun, even though the Sun’s gravitational pull on Earth is around 178 times stronger than that of the Moon.
