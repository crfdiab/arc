What kind of plate boundary is Mount Vesuvius on?
-------------------------------------------------

convergent boundary  
Vesuvius is a stratovolcano at the convergent boundary where the African Plate is being subducted beneath the Eurasian Plate.

What volcanoes are found at constructive plate boundaries?
----------------------------------------------------------

At a constructive plate boundary – also known as a divergent plate boundary – the plates are moving apart from one another….shield volcanoes.

What type of volcano is formed at a destructive plate boundary?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Composite volcanoes are the most common type of volcano and are common at destructive plate boundaries. The lava is viscous (thick) and has a higher silica level than with shield volcanoes. In a composite volcano the magma is too stiff to allow easy escape of volcanic gases.

What are the boundaries of a constructive plate?
------------------------------------------------

Plate A would be the North American plate which is moving westwards, where plate B would be the Eurasian plate which is moving eastwards Small scale landforms at constructive plate boundaries are lava tubes and geysers.

How are volcanoes and earthquakes related to plate boundaries?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Tectonic plates are pieces of the rocky outer layer of the Earth known as the crust. These plates are constantly moving, and volcanoes and earthquakes are found at plate boundaries. There are a number of different types of plate boundary. A destructive plate boundary is sometimes called a convergent or tensional plate margin.

How are collision boundaries formed in a collision zone?
--------------------------------------------------------

Collision zones form when two continental plates collide. Neither plate is forced under the other, and so both are forced up and form fold mountains. A constructive plate boundary, sometimes called a divergent plate margin, occurs when plates move apart.

Are there volcanoes at a conservative plate boundary?
-----------------------------------------------------

The earthquakes at a conservative plate boundary can be very destructive as they occur close to the Earth’s surface. There are no volcanoes at a conservative plate boundary.
