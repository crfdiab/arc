How are climax communities different from?
------------------------------------------

An ecological community in which populations of plants or animals remain stable and exist in balance with each other and their environment. A climax community is the final stage of succession, remaining relatively unchanged until destroyed by an event such as fire or human interference.

What is an example of a climax community species?
-------------------------------------------------

When extensive and well defined, the climax community is called a biome. Examples are tundra, grassland, desert, and the deciduous, coniferous, and tropical rain forests. Stability is attained through a process known as succession, whereby relatively simple communities are replaced by those more complex.

What is meant by climax community?
----------------------------------

In scientific ecology, climax community or climatic climax community is a historic term for a community of plants, animals, and fungi which, through the process of ecological succession in the development of vegetation in an area over time, have reached a steady state.

What is the difference between pioneer species and climax communities?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between pioneer species and climax communities? Pioneer species are the first species that settle or colonize an area. Climax communities are made of species that are stable and don’t change very much.

Are R species in climax communities?
------------------------------------

They are the opposite of pioneer species, also known as ruderal, fugitive, opportunistic or R-selected species, in the sense that climax species are good competitors but poor colonizers, whereas pioneer species are good colonizers but poor competitors.

Can pioneer community members be found in a climax community?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Which statement best compares pioneer species in climax communities?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Which statement best compares pioneer species with climax communities? Both are involved with stages of succession, but climax communities are the beginning and pioneer species are the end result.

What type of conditions might prevent a community from returning to a climax community?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Natural disturbances and human interference are some kinds of conditions that might prevent a community from returning to its predisturbance state.

Why are there different types of climax communities?
----------------------------------------------------

Rather, it is appropriate to recognise several different communities as climax. Poly-climax theory of succession stresses that many different types of vegetation form the climax community, depending on local conditions. The climax community should be in harmony with the whole environment and not just climate.

Is the climax a dynamic or self everlasting state?
--------------------------------------------------

The climax is a dynamic and self-everlasting state. Persis­tence is the key to climax. In a climax community, all species (including dominant species), are continually able to reproduce successfully and persists in a uniform climatic area. Welcome to NotesOnZoology.com!

How is seral community different from climax community?
-------------------------------------------------------

The upcoming discussion will update you about the differences between seral community and climax community. 1. It is transitional community which develops in an area during succession. 2. Seral community is replaced by another subsequent successional community. 3. Food chains and food webs are simple. 4. Biomass is small.

Why does equilibrium occur in the climax community?
---------------------------------------------------

This equilibrium was thought to occur because the climax community is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area. The term is sometimes also applied in soil development.
