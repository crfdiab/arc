How can you prove that water vapor is in the air?
-------------------------------------------------

The presence of water vapour in air can be demonstrated by the following experiment: We take a steel tumbler and put some well crushed ice in it. Allow the steel tumbler to stand undisturbed for about 5 minutes with the ice in it.

Can we see water vapor air?
---------------------------

It can be formed either through a process of evaporation or sublimation. Unlike clouds, fog, or mist which are simply suspended particles of liquid water in the air, water vapour itself cannot be seen because it is in gaseous form.

What does water vapor look like in the air?
-------------------------------------------

Water vapor, water vapour or aqueous vapor is the gaseous phase of water. It is one state of water within the hydrosphere. Water vapor can be produced from the evaporation or boiling of liquid water or from the sublimation of ice. Water vapor is transparent, like most constituents of the atmosphere.

What is the amount of water vapor in the air?
---------------------------------------------

absolute humidity  
The amount of water vapor in the air is called absolute humidity. The amount of water vapor in the air as compared with the amount of water that the air could hold is called relative humidity.

Why can’t u see water vapor in the air?
---------------------------------------

Water is present as a liquid and as a gas in the atmosphere. You can’t see water vapor in the air, because water molecules are very small. When water is a liquid, you can see it in the form of clouds. It can also fall from the sky as precipitation.

Why can’t you see the water vapor in the air Brainpop?
------------------------------------------------------

Why can’t you see the water vapor in the air? It exists as a clear, colorless gas. Absolute humidity is how much water the air can hold; relative humidity represents how much water the air actually holds.

What happens to water vapor in the air?
---------------------------------------

The excess water vapor condenses (bringing the relative humidity down to 100%) and forms a faint cloud of very small drops of water. That’s what you are seeing.

How are relative humidity and water vapor content related?
----------------------------------------------------------

Relative humidity measures how close the air is to saturation. Saturated air is air that’s full of water vapor and can’t hold anymore. So, relative humidity is water vapor in the air divided by how much water vapor the air could hold. Relative humidity is measured as a percentage, so if the relative humidity is 100%, it means the air is saturated.

How to determine if there is water in air?
------------------------------------------

As soon as you observe changes on the surface of the container, carefully record the temperature of the water and the temperature of the surface thermometer. Examining Results The purpose of this activity is to facilitate examin- ing concrete evidence that there is water in air.

How is the vapor pressure of water determined?
----------------------------------------------

If we raise the pressure and keep the temperature, the water will condense. Two formulas have a version for vapor pressure of water over ice (so for temperatures below 0 °C). Type negative temperatures into the calculator and vapor pressure will be determined according to Buck and Tetens formulas.
