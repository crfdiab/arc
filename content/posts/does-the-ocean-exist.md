Does the ocean exist?
---------------------

The ocean is a huge body of saltwater that covers about 71 percent of Earth’s surface. The planet has one global ocean, though oceanographers and the countries of the world have traditionally divided it into four distinct regions: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans.

Are oceans always on Earth?
---------------------------

Our planet has always harbored water. The rubble that coalesced to form Earth contained trace amounts—tens to hundreds of parts per million—of the stuff. The process would take tens of millions of years, meaning that oceans were sloshing around on Earth by as early as 4.4 billion years ago.

Where can the oceans be found?
------------------------------

Most ocean life can be found in coastal habitats on the continental shelf, even if this area occupies only 7% of the total ocean area. Most of the open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Ocean and coastal habitats can be created by species living in them.

Is there only one Ocean in the world?
-------------------------------------

There is only one global ocean. While there is only one global ocean, the vast body of water that covers 71 percent of the Earth is geographically divided into distinct named regions.

Are there oceans on other planets besides Earth?
------------------------------------------------

Earth isn’t the only ocean world in our solar system. Water on other worlds exists in diverse forms on moons, dwarf planets, and even comets. Ice, water vapor in the atmosphere, and oceans on other worlds offer clues in the quest to discover life beyond our home planet.

How did the oceans come to be on Earth?
---------------------------------------

After the Earth’s surface had cooled to a temperature below the boiling point of water, rain began to fall—and continued to fall for centuries. As the water drained into the great hollows in the Earth’s surface, the primeval ocean came into existence. The forces of gravity prevented the water from leaving the planet.

What are all of the oceans?
---------------------------

Historically, there are four named oceans: the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic. However, most countries – including the United States – now recognize the Southern (Antarctic) as the fifth ocean. The Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian are known as the three major oceans. The Southern Ocean is the ‘newest’ named ocean.
