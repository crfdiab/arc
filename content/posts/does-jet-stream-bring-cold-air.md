Does jet stream bring cold air?
-------------------------------

Jet streams change position, location, and strength depending on the season. In the winter, areas in the Northern Hemisphere may get colder than in other periods as the jet stream dips “lower,” bringing cold air in from the polar regions.

Which jet stream brings cold air from the north?
------------------------------------------------

polar vortex  
A polar vortex is an area of low pressure—a wide expanse of swirling cold air—that is parked in polar regions. During winter, the polar vortex at the North Pole expands, sending cold air southward. This happens fairly often and can be associated with outbreaks of cold temperatures in the United States.

Do jet streams bring cold or warm air?
--------------------------------------

Jet streams form when warm air masses meet cold air masses in the atmosphere. On average, jet streams move at about 110 miles per hour. But dramatic temperature differences between the warm and cool air masses can cause jet streams to move at much higher speeds — 250 miles per hour or faster.

What is the difference between a subtropical jet stream and a polar jet stream?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jet streams are fast-moving currents of air that circulate above the Earth. The polar-front jet stream forms at about 60 degrees latitude in both hemispheres, while the subtropical jet stream forms at about 30 degrees.

Which best explains how El Niño affects the jet stream?
-------------------------------------------------------

Which best explains how El Niño affects the jet stream? The jet stream is pushed north and results in increased precipitation. The jet stream is pushed south and results in increased precipitation.

What happens when the jet stream moves north?
---------------------------------------------

The jet stream — America’s stormy weather maker — is creeping northward and weakening, new research shows. That potentially means less rain in the already dry South and Southwest and more storms in the North. And it could also translate into more and stronger hurricanes since the jet stream suppresses their formation.

How would a weaker jet stream help cause extreme flooding?
----------------------------------------------------------

Answer: A weaker jet stream would allow storm systems to stall in one area.

What kind of weather is carried by the jet stream?
--------------------------------------------------

Around the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, low-pressure weather fronts, which bring cloudy, windy and potentially wet weather, generally move from west to east. These are carried along by the jet stream – a current of fast-flowing air high up in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the Earth’s atmosphere.

How does the sun affect the jet stream?
---------------------------------------

This movement creates an air current, or wind. A jet stream is a type of air current that forms high in the atmosphere. The Sun heats Earth unevenly, creating masses of colder air near the poles and warmer air near the equator.

Where does the jet stream end up in the UK?
-------------------------------------------

The position of the jet stream typically ends up to the north of the UK and we see calmer, drier weather. How does the jet stream affect flights? Met Office meteorologists work in one of only two centres in the world that produce weather charts for global aviation.

How does the blocking of the jet stream work?
---------------------------------------------

He tells Carbon Brief: “Blocking is a stationary and persistent weather pattern, most often an anticyclone \[high-pressure system\], that blocks the oncoming jet stream and storms.” With a high-pressure weather system in the way, the oncoming weather is either deflected away or it, too, stays put.
