How do predators affect the population of their prey?
-----------------------------------------------------

As the prey population increases, there is more food for predators. So, after a slight lag, the predator population increases as well. As the number of predators increases, more prey are captured. As a result, the prey population starts to decrease.

How do predators change the behavior of their prey?
---------------------------------------------------

Predators in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments may affect prey populations and communities by consuming lower trophic levels (lethal or consumptive effect) or by altering prey traits including behavior, morphology, or habitat use (nonlethal or nonconsumptive effect).

What happens if the predator population decreases?
--------------------------------------------------

The most obvious result of the removal of the top predators in an ecosystem is a population explosion in the prey species. When prey becomes more scarce, the predator population declines until prey is again more abundant. Therefore, the two balance each other. When the predators are removed, prey populations explode.

Do predators always kill their prey?
------------------------------------

Predators may or may not kill their prey before eating them. But the act of predation always causes the death of its prey and taking in the prey’s body parts into the predators body. Predators are usually carnivores (meat-eaters) or omnivores (eats plants and other animals). Predators will hunt other animals for food.

What are examples of predator and prey?
---------------------------------------

Some examples of predator and prey are lion and zebra, bear and fish, and fox and rabbit. The words “predator” and “prey” are almost always used to mean only animals that eat animals, but the same concept also applies to plants: Bear and berry, rabbit and lettuce, grasshopper and leaf.

What predators kill before eating?
----------------------------------

Usually big cats kill the animal before enjoying dinner, for practical reasons, you see big cats usually prey on animals such as Wildebees, Buffaloes, Kudu , Zebras etc, This animals are huge and can weigh over 1300 pounds or 600Kg, while the biggest cat, a lion weigh about 200kg max .

What animal is a predator but not a prey?
-----------------------------------------

A top predator or apex predator is one that is not the prey of other predators. Predators are usually carnivores (meat-eaters) or omnivores (eats plants and other animals).

How does the prey relationship affect the population?
-----------------------------------------------------

Scientists studying population dynamics, or changes in populations over time, have noticed that predator prey relationships greatly affect the populations of each species, and that because of the predator prey relationship, these population fluctuations are linked.

What happens when a predator is removed from the ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------------------------

If a predator is removed from the ecosystem, the population of prey tends to surge and have damaging effects on other areas of the ecosystem such as vegetation or other small game if the prey are carnivores. This article was updated on Dece

Why do the numbers of predators go up and down?
-----------------------------------------------

They can go up and down during each year but generally over the years, these increases and decreases remain fairly constant. If numbers of either predators or prey increase or decrease it could be due to a change in the abiotic factors, like water or sunlight, or biotic factors, like a new predator or pathogen.

Why do Predators need to be adapted to survive?
-----------------------------------------------

Predator species need to be adapted for efficient hunting if they are to catch enough food to survive. Prey species must be well adapted to escape predators for their species to continue. If the prey population in an ecosystem grows, predator numbers will respond to the increased food supply by increasing as well.
