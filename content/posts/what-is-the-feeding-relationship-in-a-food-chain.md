What is the feeding relationship in a food chain?
-------------------------------------------------

Feeding relationships show what organisms eat or are eaten by others and through this the levels of organisation in an ecosystem. These can be shown in food chains , which add together to make food webs for a habitat .

What are the feeding relationships differentiate between food chain and food web?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Food chain refers to a feeding hierarchy in which organisms in an ecosystem are grouped into trophic (nutritional) levels and are shown in a succession to represent a linear flow of food energy and the feeding relationships between them while food web refers to a graphical model showing the interconnecting food chains …

What are some feeding relationships?
------------------------------------

There are a great many feeding relationships in any ecosystem, but energy always flows from primary producers to various consumers. These feeding relationships are represented by food chains and food webs….Make Your Own Food Web

- Producers.
- Consumers.
- Herbivores.
- Omnivore.
- Carnivore.
- Decomposers.
- Scavengers. What is the feeding relationship between producers consumers and decomposers?
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    “How might different types of organisms–producers, consumers, decomposers–be important to a healthy ecosystem?” (Producers change energy into matter with chemical energy that other organisms can use and then consumers pass the matter and energy on to other organisms by eating and being eaten; decomposers recycle some …
    
    What is the relationship between energy flow and food chain?
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Energy flow is the flow of energy through living things within an ecosystem. All living organisms can be organized into producers and consumers, and those producers and consumers can further be organized into a food chain. Each of the levels within the food chain is a trophic level.
    
    What shows all the possible feeding relationships in a community?
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The model they create, a food web, expresses all the possible feeding relationships at each trophic level in a community.
    
    What are the feeding relationships between different organisms?
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Identify some possible feeding relationships between the different populations of organisms in this community. Some types of fish could eat other types of fish, the fish can eat the seaweed, the turtles eat the seaweed\]
    
    How are food chains and webs model feeding relationships?
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    • Explain how food chains and webs model feeding relationships. • Identify trophic levels in a food chain or web. • Define community as the term is used in ecology. • Describe interdependent relationship like predation and competition and their effects on population size.
    
    How are food chains and food webs linked in an ecosystem?
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    Energy Flow in Ecosystems. In every ecosystem, organisms are linked through feeding relationships. There are a great many feeding relationships in any ecosystem, but energy always flows from primary producers to various consumers. These feeding relationships are represented by food chains and food webs.
    
    Who are the primary consumers of wood mice?
    -------------------------------------------
    
    Squirrels and earthworms are primary consumers, and the wood mice are secondary consumers. The foxes and owls are tertiary consumers (the foxes are also secondary consumers). Foxes and owls eat the wood mice, and foxes eat wood mice and squirrels. The fungi and earthworms are decomposers in this food web.
