Why is the ocean saltier in some places?
----------------------------------------

Salt in the ocean comes from two sources: runoff from the land and openings in the seafloor. Rocks on land are the major source of salts dissolved in seawater. Rainwater that falls on land is slightly acidic, so it erodes rocks. Ocean water seeps into cracks in the seafloor and is heated by magma from the Earth’s core.

Does the equator have high salinity?
------------------------------------

Therefore, the salinity is the highest in the equatorial region, but due to increase in temperature in equatorial region, the density is the lowest in the equatorial region. Therefore, we can say, the sea water has the highest surface density at the polar latitudes than the equatorial region.

Which sea has the highest salinity in the world?
------------------------------------------------

Of the five ocean basins, the Atlantic Ocean is the saltiest. On average, there is a distinct decrease of salinity near the equator and at both poles, although for different reasons.

What is the saltiest part of the ocean?
---------------------------------------

Red Sea  
The saltiest locations in the ocean are the regions where evaporation is highest or in large bodies of water where there is no outlet into the ocean. The saltiest ocean water is in the Red Sea and in the Persian Gulf region (around 40‰) due to very high evaporation and little fresh water inflow.

Is the salinity the oceans highest at the equator?
--------------------------------------------------

Yes, salinity is higher in warmer waters, which would be near the equator. This is because the sun is brighter and makes the water warmer. It also causes more evaporation of the water into the air, yet the salt is not able to be evaporated, so it’s left behind in the warm water.

Why are some parts of the ocean saltier than others?
----------------------------------------------------

Rainwater dilutes the concentrated salts in the ocean water. Parts of the ocean that do not receive heavy rainfall remain more highly saline. This happens mostly in hot and dry regions. In these areas, winds are accompanied by storms which carry away the vapor in the atmosphere above the sea creating room for more evaporation.

Why are oceans near the equator less alkaline?
----------------------------------------------

Oceans near the equator are less saline compared to the ones within the tropics where rainfall is much lower than in equator. Oceans in polar regions are not much alkaline because of a lot of fresh water from melting ice.

Why does salinity decrease from the tropics to the Poles?
---------------------------------------------------------

Salinity decreases from the tropics towards the poles. Evaporation of ocean water within the equator is slow since there is high rainfall which dilutes salts that accumulate on the surface of the water after high evaporation.
