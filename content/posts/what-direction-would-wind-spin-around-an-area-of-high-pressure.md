What direction would wind spin around an area of high pressure?
---------------------------------------------------------------

counterclockwise  
A low pressure area would have a clockwise turning and a high pressure area a counterclockwise turning. and Winds Around High Pressure Systems Turn in the Opposite Direction of the Earth’s Rotation.

How do winds flow around high and low pressure?
-----------------------------------------------

In reality, wind does not flow directly from areas of high to low pressure as there is a separate force at work – the Coriolis effect. The resulting path of the wind therefore spirals in an outwards direction from areas of high pressure and spirals in an inward direction around areas of low pressure.

What is the wind circulation around a high pressure area in northern hemisphere?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As air tries to move from high to low pressure in the atmosphere, the Coriolis force diverts the air so that it follows the pressure contours. In the Northern Hemisphere, this means that air is blown around low pressure in an anticlockwise direction and around high pressure in a clockwise direction.

How do winds circulate around a center of high pressure in each hemisphere?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Winds flow clockwise around a high pressure center in the northern hemisphere, while in the southern hemisphere, winds flow counterclockwise around a high. This is why fair weather is commonly associated with an area of high pressure.

What do you mean by high pressure area and low pressure area?
-------------------------------------------------------------

High-pressure areas are places where the atmosphere is relatively thick. High-pressure areas usually are areas of fair, settled weather. Low-pressure areas are places where the atmosphere is relatively thin. Winds blow inward toward these areas. This causes air to rise, producing clouds and condensation.

How are winds around low and high pressure systems different?
-------------------------------------------------------------

A low pressure area would have a clockwise turning and a high pressure area a counterclockwise turning. In summary: Winds Around Low pressure Systems Turn in the Direction of the Earth’s Rotation and Winds Around High Pressure Systems Turn in the Opposite Direction of the Earth’s Rotation.

How are winds around a high pressure center calculated?
-------------------------------------------------------

Winds at 0º could not be calculated mathematically. Notice that the winds in the Northern Hemisphere (the upper half of the image) are turning clockwise, and the winds in the Southern Hemisphere (bottom half) are turning counterclockwise. The pressure gradient begins at 1.5 mb / 100 km and decreases in 0.1 mb / 100 km increments.

How does wind flow in the northern hemisphere?
----------------------------------------------

This force acts at right angles to the pressure gradient force, causing wind to be deflected to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. The resulting path of the wind therefore spirals in an outwards direction from areas of high pressure and spirals in an inward direction around areas of low pressure.

What causes wind to flow through a balloon?
-------------------------------------------

Wind flow. The balancing of high and low pressure is what causes wind flow. The pressure gradient force drives winds from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure. This force can be demonstrated very simply using a rubber balloon.
