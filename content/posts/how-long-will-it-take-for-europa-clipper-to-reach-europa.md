How long will it take for Europa Clipper to reach Europa?
---------------------------------------------------------

Launch is targeted for a 21-day period between 10 and 30 October 2024, giving an arrival date in April 2030, and backup launch dates were identified in 2025 and 2026. The SLS option would have entailed a direct trajectory to Jupiter taking less than three years.

How long will it take the Europa Clipper to get to Jupiter?
-----------------------------------------------------------

about three years  
After the last of its gravity assists by an inner planet, a Europa-bound spacecraft would still take about three years to reach Jupiter, just as a much smaller spacecraft would on a direct route from Earth.

How long will it take to get to Europa from Earth?
--------------------------------------------------

The transportation of humans to Europa would be one of the primary challenges to colonization. Since Jupiter is on average 630.4 million kilometers away from Earth at a given time, it would take at least 3 years just to get into Europa’s orbit plus additional time to land.

How many missions have there been to Europa?
--------------------------------------------

Six robotic spacecraft have explored Europa, but most of what we know comes from three of them: NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft, the Galileo orbiter and the Hubble Space Telescope.

What was the first spacecraft to cross the heliosphere?
-------------------------------------------------------

Voyager 1 1 Firsts. Voyager 1 was the first spacecraft to cross the heliosphere, the boundary where the influences outside our solar system are stronger than those from our Sun. 2 Key Dates. A 3D model of NASA’s twin Voyager spacecraft. 3 In Depth: Voyager 1. 4 Additional Resources 5 Key Source. …

What was the name of the first NASA spacecraft?
-----------------------------------------------

No spacecraft has gone farther than NASA’s Voyager 1. Launched in 1977 to fly by Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 1 crossed into interstellar space in August 2012 and continues to collect data. Voyager 1 and its sister ship Voyager 2 have been flying longer than any other spacecraft in history.

Are there any spacecraft that have been to Io?
----------------------------------------------

Spacecraft have studied Io on flybys (Voyager and Cassini) or orbiting Jupiter (Galileo). Most recently, New Horizons observed Io en route to Pluto. Ingredients for life? Io almost certainly could not support life as we know it.

When was the Voyager 1 launched into space?
-------------------------------------------

Launched in 1977 to fly by Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 1 crossed into interstellar space in August 2012 and continues to collect data. Voyager 1 and its sister ship Voyager 2 have been flying longer than any other spacecraft in history.
