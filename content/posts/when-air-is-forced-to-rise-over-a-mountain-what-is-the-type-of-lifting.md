When air is forced to rise over a mountain What is the type of lifting?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Orographic lift occurs when an air mass is forced from a low elevation to a higher elevation as it moves over rising terrain. As the air mass gains altitude it quickly cools down adiabatically, which can raise the relative humidity to 100% and create clouds and, under the right conditions, precipitation.

What happens to the warm air as it rises up a mountain?
-------------------------------------------------------

As air rises over a mountain it cools and loses moisture, then warms by compression on the leeward side. The resulting warm and dry winds are Chinook winds. The leeward side of the mountain experiences rainshadow effect.

What happens as air is forced upward in the atmosphere?
-------------------------------------------------------

In other words, the warmer air mass is forced to rise over the colder air mass. As air from the warm air mass rises, it cools, leading to the development of clouds and maybe precipitation.

Why does air rise in orographic lifting?
----------------------------------------

When wind hits a mountain, it is forced to rise. This rising motion helps the air cool and moisture condenses into snow. Orographic lift is the technical term for terrain forcing air to rise.

What are the four processes that lift the air?
----------------------------------------------

– There are four lifting mechanisms that form clouds: Orographic Lifting, Convection, Convergence, and Updraft.

What process does not lift air?
-------------------------------

Melting, sublimation, freezing, evaporation, condensation. Which one of the following is NOT a process that lifts air? Convergence, orographic lifting, divergence, frontal wedging, localized convective lifting. Air that has reached its water-vapor capacity.

Why does the air go up over the mountains?
------------------------------------------

Air in the lower levels will be forced up to rise over the mountains. It can’t go down because the ground is below (or, there’s more air below that’s also being forced up). Therefore this lower-level air gets lifted over the mountains. Remember that the low-level air is moister than the air above.

What happens on the windward side of a mountain?
------------------------------------------------

While air on the windward side of a mountain is forced to rise, often resulting in clouds and precipitation, the air on the leeward side of a mountain is forced to sink. Thus on the leeward side of a mountain, we often see clear skies and warm, dry conditions.

What happens when air is forced to rise?
----------------------------------------

If an air parcel rises because atmospheric conditions are unstable, free convection results. If air is forced to rise due to external factors, it is called forced convection. Forced convection can occur in a number of settings, even if the atmospheric conditions are stable.

What happens if you put a mountain into a flow?
-----------------------------------------------

If you put a mountain into the flow, the air is going to crash into the mountain on the windward side and there’s going to be kind of a hole left in the flow (that “vacuum”) on the leeward side.
