What is the term for all of the organisms in a given area as well as the abiotic factors with which they interact?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An ecosystem is a biological environment consisting of all the organisms living in a particular area, as well as all the nonliving (abiotic), physical components of the environment with which the organisms interact, such as air, soil, water and sunlight.

What are all living organisms in an ecosystem?
----------------------------------------------

The living organisms in an ecosystem can be divided into three categories: producers, consumers and decomposers. They are all important parts of an ecosystem.

What are the biotic and abiotic factors of an ecosystem?
--------------------------------------------------------

Ecosystems contain biotic or living, parts, as well as abiotic factors, or nonliving parts. Biotic factor s include plants, animals, and other organisms. Abiotic factors include rock s, temperature, and humidity. Every factor in an ecosystem depends on every other factor, either directly or indirectly.

Where do abiotic components originate in the hydrosphere?
---------------------------------------------------------

Abiotic components originate from the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere Discover more about Abiotic and Biotic factors, their meaning, the difference between abiotic and biotic resources and other related topics only at BYJUâ€™S Biology

Which is an example of a biotic resource?
-----------------------------------------

Examples of biotic resources include all the living components present in an ecosystem. These include producers, consumers, decomposers and detritivores. The term abiotic refers to all the non-living factors present in an ecosystem.

What kind of organisms live in an aquatic environment?
------------------------------------------------------

Some organisms, such as seaweed, thrive in an aquatic environment, when the tide is in and the pool is full. Other organisms, such as hermit crabs, cannot live underwater and depend on the shallow pools left by low tides. In this way, the biotic parts of the ecosystem depend on abiotic factors.
