What is the closest volcano to Idaho?
-------------------------------------

The Bruneau-Jarbidge caldera (sometimes called a supervolcano) is located in present-day southwest Idaho. The volcano erupted during the Miocene, between ten and twelve million years ago, spreading a thick blanket of ash in the Bruneau-Jarbidge event and forming a caldera.

Where did all the lava come from in Idaho?
------------------------------------------

Geologists think that the abundant lava flows and other volcanic rocks of the Snake River Plain were created when the North American tectonic plate passed southwest over a mantle plume, a fixed “hotspot” in the Earth’s mantle (the layer of Earth below the crust).

When did the volcano in Idaho erupt?
------------------------------------

On May 18, 1980 at 8:32 a.m. PDT, the north side of the volcano fell away in a large landslide (debris avalanche). As the overlying rock that held in the pressurized magma fell away, the now unconfined magma erupted out the north side of the mountain in an explosive lateral blast.

Which state has the most active volcanoes?

Alaska. Alaska is home to the largest number of potentially active volcanoes in the U.S., with 141, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory.

Is Craters of the Moon still active?

Are there any volcanoes in the state of Idaho?
----------------------------------------------

Idaho is home to several young volcanoes, including the Craters of the Moon, Wapi, Kings Bowl, North and South Robbers, Cerro Grande, Hells Half Acre, and Shoshone lava fields. Craters of the Moon is one of the youngest volcanic areas in Idaho and may be the most likely in the state to erupt again.

How big is the lava field in Idaho?
-----------------------------------

The Wapi lava field, SE of the Craters of the Moon, Idaho, is a low shield volcano that formed during an eruption about 2250 years ago, which produced about 6 cubic km of fluid pahoehoe lava flows. It covers about 325 km2, and consists of a low shield volcano, which partly overla…

Where are the volcanoes in Twin Falls Idaho?
--------------------------------------------

(shield volcano) The Shoshone lava field north of Twin Falls, Idaho, is the westernmost of the young lava fields of the Snake River Plain. Its most prominent feature is a L-shaped 2 to 5 km wide and 60 km long lava flow. The last activity from Shoshone volcano has been radiocarbon dated at …

Where are the craters of the Moon in Idaho?
-------------------------------------------

The Craters of the Moon are located at the NW end of the largest lava field of the Snake River Plain in Idaho, USA. The volcanic field contains over 60 lava flows, 25 cinder cones up to 250-m high, and 8 eruptive fissure systems, and covers an area of 1600 km2. The Craters \[more\]
