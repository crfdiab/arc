When did the oxygen cycle start?
--------------------------------

around 4.6 billion years ago  
According to the earth’s history, oxygen gas was first introduced by cyanobacteria through the process of photosynthesis. Earlier, around 4.6 billion years ago, there was no life on planet earth because the atmosphere was devoid of oxygen.

How has the carbon cycle changed over time?
-------------------------------------------

Today, the carbon cycle is changing. Humans are moving more carbon into the atmosphere from other parts of the Earth system. More carbon is moving to the atmosphere when fossil fuels, like coal and oil, are burned. More carbon is moving to the atmosphere as humans get rid of forests by burning the trees.

Is the carbon cycle the same as the oxygen cycle?
-------------------------------------------------

During photosynthesis, plants give off oxygen as a waste product. Carbon dioxide moves from the air into the leaves of plants through tiny openings in the plant’s leaves. Oxygen moves out of the plant leaf through these same openings. All animals, including humans, require oxygen to survive.

Does carbon cycle go on forever?
--------------------------------

The simple answer is no. Once we release the carbon dioxide stored in the fossil fuels we burn, it accumulates in and moves among the atmosphere, the oceans, the land and the plants and animals of the biosphere. The released carbon dioxide will remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years.

What is the biggest source of oxygen on Earth?
----------------------------------------------

Scientists estimate that 50-80% of the oxygen production on Earth comes from the ocean. The majority of this production is from oceanic plankton — drifting plants, algae, and some bacteria that can photosynthesize.

Where did all the carbon on Earth come from?
--------------------------------------------

BIOdotEDU. All the carbon atoms in the human body were created in the stars. Elementary particles, such as protons, were formed during the “big bang”; that amazing moment about 14 billion years ago in which the universe got it’s start.

How the oxygen cycle and carbon cycle are linked?
-------------------------------------------------

The oxygen cycle is closely linked to the carbon cycle and the water cycle (see hydrological cycle). In the process of respiration oxygen is taken in by living organisms and released into the atmosphere, combined with carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide.

What is the relationship between the oxygen cycle and carbon cycle?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

They act separately but are dependent on each other because the carbon cycle gives off oxygen for the oxygen cycle to use, and in turn, the oxygen cycle emits carbon dioxide (CO2) which goes back into the carbon cycle. Plants are the main vehicle by which the oxygen and carbon cycles are connected.

Which country is the largest producer of artificial oxygen?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Air Liquide and integrated energy and chemical company Sasol have today officially inaugurated the world’s largest oxygen (O2) production plant in South Africa.
