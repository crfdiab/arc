Which layer is composed of both continental crust and oceanic crust?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

lithosphere  
The lithosphere is composed of both the crust and the portion of the upper mantle that behaves as a brittle, rigid solid.

What are the components of oceanic and continental crust?
---------------------------------------------------------

Continental crust is broadly granitic in composition and, with a density of about 2.7 grams per cubic cm, is somewhat lighter than oceanic crust, which is basaltic (i.e., richer in iron and magnesium than granite) in composition and has a density of about 2.9 to 3 grams per cubic cm.

What is mantle composed of?
---------------------------

silicate rocks  
Mantle. The mantle under the crust is about 1,800 miles deep (2,890 km). It is composed mostly of silicate rocks rich in magnesium and iron.

Are composed of the crust and a part of the upper mantle?
---------------------------------------------------------

Earth’s lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which constitutes the hard and rigid outer layer of the Earth. The lithosphere is subdivided into tectonic plates. The lithosphere is underlain by the asthenosphere which is the weaker, hotter, and deeper part of the upper mantle.

What makes up the upper mantle of the Earth?
--------------------------------------------

Three lines of evidence for upper mantle: Earth has two types of crust – oceanic and continental. Oceanic crust is composed of basalt, the result of partial melting of the mantle. It is rich in Mg, Fe, Ca, Al which are in the minerals olivine, pyroxene plagioclase feldspar.

What makes up the Oceanic and continental crust?
------------------------------------------------

The oceanic crust is mainly made out of dark basalt rocks that are rich in minerals and substances like silicon, calcium and magnesium. The continental crust is made up of light-colored granite rocks full of substances like oxygen, aluminum, sodium, potassium and silicon.

How is the continental crust derived from the mantle?
-----------------------------------------------------

All continental crust is ultimately derived from mantle-derived melts (mainly basalt) through fractional differentiation of basaltic melt and the assimilation (remelting) of pre-existing continental crust.

What kind of minerals are found in the mantle?
----------------------------------------------

It is rich in Mg, Fe, Ca, Al which are in the minerals olivine, pyroxene plagioclase feldspar. Continental crust diverse, old, and composed of incompatible elements that do not fit well in the minerals stable in the mantle (K and Na). The elements are concentrated in low-density minerals such as quartz and feldspar.
