What is the short term of earthquake?
-------------------------------------

Short-Term Prediction Short-term predication involves monitoring of processes that occur in the vicinity of earthquake prone faults for activity that signify a coming earthquake. Anomalous events or processes that may precede an earthquake are called precursor events and might signal a coming earthquake.

How are earthquakes caused short answer?
----------------------------------------

Earthquakes are usually caused when rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake. When two blocks of rock or two plates are rubbing against each other, they stick a little. When the rocks break, the earthquake occurs.

How do small earthquakes happen?
--------------------------------

Fault lines — or different portions of the same fault — can be classified as locked or creeping. Creeping faults shift slowly over time, and may undergo smaller quakes like the ones observed this week. Locked faults, however, don’t move, causing pressure to build until a large-magnitude earthquake releases it.

What is the basic rule of earthquake safety?
--------------------------------------------

If you are indoors when a earthquake hits: Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to exit. Stay away from bookcases and other furniture that can fall on you. Stay away from windows and light fixtures. If you are in bed – hold on and stay there.

What happens to the Earth when there is an earthquake?
------------------------------------------------------

When the stresses get too large, it leads to cracks called faults. When tectonic plates move, it also causes movements at the faults. An earthquake is the sudden movement of Earth’s crust at a fault line. This photograph shows the San Andreas Fault, a 750-mile-long fault in California. Credit: Public Domain

What are long-term processes and short-term triggers produce earthquakes?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

More precisely, what long-term processes and short-term triggers produce earthquakes? Although plate tectonics has provided a successful framework for understanding the long-term processes, the short-term triggers remain obscure, making earthquakes unpredictable.

How is short-term predication used in earthquake prediction?
------------------------------------------------------------

Short-Term Prediction. Short-term predication involves monitoring of processes that occur in the vicinity of earthquake prone faults for activity that signify a coming earthquake. Anomalous events or processes that may precede an earthquake are called precursor events and might signal a coming earthquake.

How does slip affect the motion of an earthquake?
-------------------------------------------------

The friction changes as a function of slip (relative displacement of the two sides of the fault plane), velocity, and history of contact. Thus, frictional stress controls seismic motion. An earthquake can occur only if friction decreases rapidly with slip, a process referred to as slip weakening.
