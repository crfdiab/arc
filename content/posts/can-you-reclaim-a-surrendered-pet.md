Can you reclaim a surrendered pet?
----------------------------------

If a rescue/shelter still has an animal who was surrendered, it is up to the rescue/shelter to decide whether to return the animal. New adopters are not obligated to return an animal to a prior owner who voluntarily surrendered the animal. I hope the dog is doing well.

What’s the difference between rescue and adoption?
--------------------------------------------------

This also means that what you see and hear is what you will get when you adopt from an animal rescue. The adoption process from a rescue is generally a lot more involved as compared to adopting from a shelter. Animals from rescues are often very healthy, spayed and neutered, and have a complete round of vaccinations.

How long do animals stay in shelters before being put down?
-----------------------------------------------------------

These laws provide the minimum required period that an animal (usually a dog or cat) must be kept at a pound or public animal shelter before it is sold, adopted out, or euthanized. Typically, the holding period runs from five to seven days. However, it can be as short as 48 to 72 hours in some cases.

What happens to shelter animals that are not adopted?
-----------------------------------------------------

If your dog doesn’t get adopted within its 72 hours and the shelter is full, it will be destroyed. If the shelter isn’t full and your dog is good enough, and of a desirable enough breed, it may get a stay of execution, though not for long. Even the sweetest dogs will turn in this environment.

Do cats feel sad when you give them away?
-----------------------------------------

Research has shown that cats don’t show signs of separation anxiety when their owner is away. Some cat owners know this: you return from a holiday but your cat acts pretty indifferently! Other cats even behave like they are “offended” and pretend not to see you at all.

Why do rescues make it so hard to adopt?
----------------------------------------

Given that rescue dogs come from more difficult backgrounds, they often require specific living requirements and specialist care that the average aspiring dog owner, through no fault of their own, is unable to provide, making the adoption process very hard.

Do dogs know when they are about to be put down?
------------------------------------------------

Answer: Fortunately for us, dogs do not understand they are going to be put down and what happens after they are given the injection that puts them to sleep. Question: My dog was given a sedative before euthanasia. The vet said it would take 5-10 minutes to take effect and said they’d return after that.

Does PetSmart kill animals?
---------------------------

Another PETA investigation found that a supplier to large stores such as Petco and PetSmart killed animals in makeshift gas chambers, forced mice to live in extremely crowded cages, and even slammed a bag of hamsters against a table in an attempt to kill them.

Do dogs know they are abandoned?
--------------------------------

Have you ever wondered whether an animal that has been abandoned can trust humans again? Scientific research confirms what many owners of adopted animals already know, which is that dogs can form emotional bonds with people again, despite having lived for a while in a shelter for abandoned animals.

Can you bring a fake ID to Las Vegas?
-------------------------------------

Don’t bring a fake ID. Don’t bring a fake ID. Las Vegas’s pool parties, nightclubs, luxe bars and free-flowing casino booze are sure to lure the not-quite-legal-to-drink age bracket. However, if you haven’t turned 21 yet, don’t even think about showing up with a fake ID.

Is it legal to have a brothel in Las Vegas?
-------------------------------------------

Though you’ll likely see escort cards on the Strip and may even be propositioned at seedier hotels, prostitution is illegal in Clark County. Nevada allows counties with a population below 700,000 to offer brothel prostitution, and there are around 20 legal brothels in the state, but none are in Las Vegas.

How old do you have to be to gamble in Las Vegas?
-------------------------------------------------

You must be 21 or over to drink or gamble. Those under 21 can walk through the casino, but they cannot stand around the gaming areas, even if accompanied by an adult. How old do you need to be to book a room in Las Vegas? Most Vegas hotels require a person to be 21 or over to book a room. However, the other guests staying can be any age.
