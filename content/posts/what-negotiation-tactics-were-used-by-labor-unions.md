What negotiation tactics were used by labor unions?
---------------------------------------------------

The tactics available to the union include striking, picketing, and boycotting. When they go on strike, workers walk away from their jobs and refuse to return until the issue at hand has been resolved.

What are the tactics used by labor unions?
------------------------------------------

Generally speaking, workers must individually decide if wages and conditions are acceptable on their jobs, and allow the forces of the labor market to sort out pay and conditions. Occasionally, workers organize unions in attempts to collectively impact management policies.

When to use strike tactics in labor negotiations?
-------------------------------------------------

The strike is typically reserved as a threat of last resort during negotiations between the company and the union. Occasionally, workers decide to strike without the sanction of a labor union. This is either because the union refuses to endorse the tactic, or because the workers concerned are not unionized.

How does a labor union use collective bargaining?
-------------------------------------------------

While a union uses collective bargaining to pressure management into recognizing workers’ grievances and making changes in pay and promotion policies, union officials frequently also use collective bargaining agreements to help ensure the longevity of the union itself.

Can a worker strike without the support of the Union?
-----------------------------------------------------

Occasionally, workers decide to strike without the sanction of a labor union. This is either because the union refuses to endorse the tactic, or because the workers concerned are not unionized. Such strikes are often described as unofficial.
