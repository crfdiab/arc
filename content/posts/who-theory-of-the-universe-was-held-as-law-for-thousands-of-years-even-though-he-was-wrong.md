It’s like a universe inside a universe. In a multiverse, different universes may have different laws of nature, physics, at work.

How does the Big Bang theory explain the universe?
--------------------------------------------------

The Big Bang Theory is an explanation, based mostly on mathematical models, on how and when the Universe came into existence. The cosmological model of the Universe described in the Big Bang theory explains how it initially expanded from a state of infinite density and temperature, known as the primordial (or gravitational) singularity.

When did Albert Einstein think the universe was everlasting?
------------------------------------------------------------
