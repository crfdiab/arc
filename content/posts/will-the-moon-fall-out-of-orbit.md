Will the Moon fall out of orbit?
--------------------------------

In about 50 billion years, the Moon will stop moving away from us and settle into a nice, stable orbit. At this point, the Moon will take about 47 days to go around the Earth (currently, it takes a little over 27 days). When this new stability is achieved, the Earth and the Moon will be tidally locked to each other.

Why is the Moon out of orbit?
-----------------------------

NASA says this is due to a “wobble” in the moon’s orbit working in tandem with climate change-fueled rising sea levels.

What happens if the Moon leave its orbit?
-----------------------------------------

If left unabated the Moon would continue in its retreat until it would take bout 47 days to orbit the Earth. Both Earth and Moon would then keep the same faces permanently turned toward one another as Earth’s spin would also have slowed to one rotation every 47 days.

Is Moon drifting away from Earth?
---------------------------------

Earth’s rotation causes this tidal bulge to occur in a position which is slightly ahead of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth, which causes some of the energy of the Earth’s rotation to get transferred to the tidal bulge via friction. The Moon is moving away from the Earth at a rate of about 3.78 cm per year.

Could the Moon hit the earth?
-----------------------------

Scientists have long agreed that the Moon formed when a protoplanet, called Theia, struck Earth in its infancy some 4.5 billion years ago. Now, a team of scientists has a provocative new proposal: Theia’s remains can be found in two continent-size layers of rock buried deep in Earth’s mantle.

Is the Moon ever going to leave Earth’s orbit?
----------------------------------------------

But the Moon’s outward spiral is dwindling as its distance from Earth decreases and its tidal forces get weaker. This alone should be enough to prevent our satellite from ever leaving orbit around Earth completely without intervention from some outside force.

Why does the Moon move out of the ecliptic?
-------------------------------------------

The Moon’s orbit is at 60 Earth radii, which is well beyond the Laplace radius so the Laplace plane is very close to the ecliptic. So even if the orbit of the Moon were in the Earth’s equatorial plane, precession would cause it to move out of the plane.

How is the Moon’s orbit different from other satellites?
--------------------------------------------------------

The Moon differs from most satellites of other planets in that its orbit is close to the ecliptic plane instead of that of its primary (in this case, Earth’s) equatorial plane. The Moon’s orbital plane is inclined by about 5.1° with respect to the ecliptic plane, whereas the Moon’s equatorial plane is tilted by only 1.5°.

Is the Moon getting closer to the Sun?
--------------------------------------

(The Moon’s orbit has a radius of 384,000 km.) I wouldn’t say that the Moon is getting closer to the Sun, specifically, though–it is getting farther from the Earth, so, when it’s in the part of its orbit closest to the Sun, it’s closer, but when it’s in the part of its orbit farthest from the Sun, it’s farther away.
