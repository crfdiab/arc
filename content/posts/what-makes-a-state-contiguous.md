What makes a state contiguous?
------------------------------

When it comes to the United States, “contiguous” refers to all of the states that touch one another, without another country or a body of water coming between them. Each of the U.S states is contiguous with one or more other states, except for two: Alaska and Hawaii. Alaska and Hawaii are, therefore, not contiguous.

What is the largest of the contiguous states?
---------------------------------------------

Alaska  
Alaska has the largest land area in the United States followed by Texas and California.

How many states are part of the contiguous states?

Can states be non-contiguous?
-----------------------------

The United States of America is made up of 48 contiguous states, which means they are adjacent, and 2 non-contiguous states which means they do not border any other U.S. state. These two non-contiguous states are Alaska and Hawaii; which also happen to be the last two states to join the union (the U.S.A).

How many states are there in the contiguous United States?

Is the contiguous states the same as the lower 48 states?
---------------------------------------------------------

How is the contiguous zone different from the territorial sea?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike the territorial sea, the contiguous zone only gives jurisdiction to a State on the ocean’s surface and floor. 3 It does not provide air and space rights. Unlike other zones whose existence derived from earlier international law, the EEZ was a creation of the LOSC.
