What faults are in the Ring of Fire?
------------------------------------

These areas of breakage or slippage are called faults. The majority of Earth’s faults can be found along transform boundaries in the Ring of Fire. The San Andreas Fault, stretching along the central west coast of North America, is one of the most active faults on the Ring of Fire.

What type of boundaries are found at the Ring of Fire?
------------------------------------------------------

The abundance of volcanoes and earthquakes along the Ring of Fire is caused by the amount of movement of tectonic plates in the area. Along much of the Ring of Fire, plates overlap at convergent boundaries called subduction zones. That is, the plate that is underneath is pushed down, or subducted, by the plate above.

Is Los Angeles in the Ring of Fire?
-----------------------------------

The Pacific Ring of Fire encompasses many major cities along the US West Coast. Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles are all along that coast.

How are the boundaries of the ring of fire determined?
------------------------------------------------------

Plate Boundaries The Ring of Fire is the result of plate tectonics. Tectonic plates are huge slabs of the Earth’s crust, which fit together like pieces of a puzzle. The plates are not fixed but are constantly moving atop a layer of solid and molten rock called the mantle.

Where does the ring of fire take place?
---------------------------------------

What is the “Ring of Fire”? Most earthquakes and volcanic eruptions do not strike randomly but occur in specific areas, such as along plate boundaries. One such area is the circum-Pacific Ring of Fire, where the Pacific Plate meets many surrounding tectonic plates. The Ring of Fire is the most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world.
