Does El Niño or La Niña cause more rain?
----------------------------------------

During El Niño years, such as 1997, the southeast receives more rain than average. La Niña is the build up of cool waters in the equatorial eastern Pacific, such as occurred in 1988 and, to a slightly lesser degree, 1998. As a result, less rain falls over the eastern Pacific.

Does El Nina bring rain?
------------------------

It’s one of the main drivers of weather in the U.S. and around the world, especially during the late fall, winter and early spring. La Niña can also act to put a damper on rain across much of the Southwest.

Is El Niño or La Niña wetter?
-----------------------------

In many locations, especially in the tropics, La Niña (or cold episodes) produces roughly the opposite climate variations from El Niño. For instance, parts of Australia and Indonesia are prone to drought during El Niño, but are typically wetter than normal during La Niña.

How does El Niño affect rain?
-----------------------------

During an El Niño event, the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean gets warmer than usual, particularly at the equator and along the coasts of South and Central America. Warm oceans lead to low pressure systems in the atmosphere above, which in turn leads to a lot of rain for the western coasts of the Americas.

Is the El Nino and La Nina the same?
------------------------------------

Areas that are hit with drought during La Niña years are pummeled with rain in El Niño years. Unlike a brother and sister, El Niño and La Niña might not be related. A La Niña year usually happens a year or two after an El Niño year. However, scientists don’t think that a La Niña is always caused by an El Niño.

Where does the rain fall during El Nino and La Nina?
----------------------------------------------------

The cooler, dry air is dense. It doesn’t rise or form storms. As a result, less rain falls over the eastern Pacific. Ecuador, Peru, and the southeastern United States are correspondingly dry. El Niño and La Niña reflect the two end points of an oscillation in the Pacific Ocean.

What happens to water in the eastern Pacific during La Nina?
------------------------------------------------------------

La Niña causes water in the eastern Pacific to be colder than usual. In the same region, El Niño can cause the water to be warmer than usual. Areas that are hit with drought during La Niña years are pummeled with rain in El Niño years.

How are scientists predicting El Nino and La Nina?
--------------------------------------------------

Thankfully, scientists can predict the El Niño and La Niña weather patterns up to a year before they occur. The GOES-R series of weather satellites can help weather forecasters map the increased lightning and issue earlier and more accurate severe weather warnings.
