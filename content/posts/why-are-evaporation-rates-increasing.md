Why are evaporation rates increasing?
-------------------------------------

Evaporation rates are higher at higher temperatures because as temperature increases, the amount of energy necessary for evaporation decreases. Wind moving over a water or land surface can also carry away water vapor, essentially drying the air, which leads to increased evaporation rates.

How does climate change affect water availability in South Africa?
------------------------------------------------------------------

By 2050, climate change is likely to have an impact on water availability in most of South Africa. Increased drying or flooding is expected, with the potential for strong localized effects. Available infrastructure allows water to be transferred between different regions of the country to meet demand.

Where is the highest evaporation?
---------------------------------

Evaporation from the oceans is the primary mechanism supporting the surface-to-atmosphere portion of the water cycle. After all, the large surface area of the oceans (over 70 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered by the oceans) provides the opportunity for large-scale evaporation to occur.

What determines evaporation rate?
---------------------------------

The evaporation rate of a solvent depends on its vapor pressure at the processing temperature, the boiling point, specific heat, enthalpy and heat of vaporization of the solvent, the rate of heat supply, the degree of association between solvent molecules and between solvent and solute molecules, the surface tension of …

What are the four factors affecting evaporation?
------------------------------------------------

Liquids changes into vapour by the process of evaporation. The factors that affect the rate of evaporation of liquids are temperature, surface area, wind speed, and humidity.

How does South Africa lose most of its moisture?
------------------------------------------------

South Africa has an average annual rainfall of less than 500 mm, while that of the world is about 850 mm. On top of this, between 37% and 42% of potable water is unaccounted for. This water is lost through leaks, wastage and illegal connections.

Which method has the lowest evaporation rate?
---------------------------------------------

Iso-butane reaches a lower peak evaporation rate, and hexane has the lowest.

What increases rate of evaporation?
-----------------------------------

A substance that has a larger surface area will evaporate faster, as there are more surface molecules per unit of volume that are potentially able to escape. the higher the temperature of the substance the greater the kinetic energy of the molecules at its surface and therefore the faster the rate of their evaporation.

What liquid will evaporate the fastest?
---------------------------------------

APLICATION. By analyzing this data, I found out that NPR(acetone) will evaporate the fastest, following by alcohol then water; milk, soda and syrup evaporated last, depending on its constitution.

How does the rate of evaporation of water depend on?
----------------------------------------------------

Evaporation is the amount of water which evaporates from an open pan called a Class A evaporation pan. The rate of evaporation depends on factors such as cloudiness, air temperature and wind speed.

Why is there so much water in South Africa?
-------------------------------------------

The eastern half of the country is much wetter than the western half due to the nature of the weather conditions. South Africa also experiences alternating periods of droughts and floods which affects the amount of water across South Africa. In addition, hot dry conditions result in a high evaporation rate.

Why is rainfall low in the Western Cape?
----------------------------------------

Cold fronts approach the Western Cape from the west, and pass over the province towards the east. These cold fronts bring days of soft rains, but the average annual rainfall in these areas is low. A major reason for the low rainfall is that the moist air comes from a cold ocean, which results in low evaporation levels.

How is the climate in southern Africa affected?
-----------------------------------------------

It is mainly influenced by large scale seasonal atmospheric patterns as well as the cool South Atlantic Ocean and warm Indian Ocean. Most of the region receives the majority of its rainfall in the summer months with the exception of southwest South Africa. Temperature and rainfall vary on annual, decadal and multi-decadal timescales.
