What is the conclusion of renewable energy?
-------------------------------------------

Because of some negative and irreversible externalities in conventional energy production, it is necessary to develop and promote renewable energy supply technologies and demand for renewable energy. Power generation using renewable energy sources should be increased in order to decrease the unit cost of generation.

What is the conclusion of sources of energy?
--------------------------------------------

Solar power is an immense source of directly useable energy and ultimately creates other energy resources: biomass, wind, hydropower and wave energy.

What are the conclusions on alternative energy strategies?
----------------------------------------------------------

The main advantage of these alternative energy sources is that they are ecologically acceptable energy sources, that unlike fossil fuels do not release large quantities of CO2 and other harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing global warming and climate change.

How can we reduce the use of non-renewable energy sources?
----------------------------------------------------------

Actions like driving electric and hybrid vehicles, installing solar panels on and properly insulating your business and home, and using energy-efficient appliances are all smaller-scale changes that you can make to reduce your nonrenewable resource usage.

What is the conclusion of fossil fuels?
---------------------------------------

“The IEA’s conclusion reflects sound science. CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels are destabilizing our climate. We cannot burn fuels like coal and oil indefinitely without paying the price in the form of climate instability, droughts, heat waves and super storms.

What is the conclusion of natural resources?
--------------------------------------------

Of all the natural resources used by humans, two stand out as having the biggest impact on human survival and environmental quality. Mineral and fossil fuel resources are largely responsible for moving human civilization from hunter-gatherer societies to heavily industrialized urban ones.
