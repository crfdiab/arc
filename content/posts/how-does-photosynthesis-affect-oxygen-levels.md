How does photosynthesis affect oxygen levels?
---------------------------------------------

Through the photosynthetic process plants take up carbon dioxide and evolve oxygen. The present high concentration of molecular oxygen in the atmosphere is generally considered to have arisen from the activity of photo-synthetic organisms.

What happens when photosynthesis is reduced?
--------------------------------------------

The oxidation-reduction action of photosynthesis transforms batches of six water molecules, H2O, and six carbon dioxide molecules, CO2, into one glucose molecule, C6H1206, and six molecules of O2, which is breathable oxygen.

What would the effect be if photosynthesis did not produce oxygen?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Without photosynthesis there would be no supply of oxygen and slowly the oxygen would get used up by oxidation such as rust formation. Furthermore, by removing plants, all of the many many animals that depend on plants would get very very hungry and gradually die.

What happen when there is an increase in the production of oxygen?
------------------------------------------------------------------

By contrast, when oxygen concentrations are higher, the atmosphere gets thicker and scatters more sunlight. As a result, there is less water vapor to trap heat. Adding in oxygen’s affects during other time periods could lead to more accurate models of the planet’s past, the researchers say.

What will happen to the rate of photosynthesis when water decreases?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Water deficit (WD) decreases photosynthetic rate (A) via decreased stomatal conductance to CO2 (gs) and photosynthetic metabolic potential (Apot). At a given intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) A decreases, showing impaired metabolism (Apot).

When enough water is not present the rate of photosynthesis decreases Why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2. Water stress. Excess water loss (transpiration) causes stomata closure and therefore decreases the photosynthetic rate.

What is the effect of increased or decreased oxygen on plant growth?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Research shows that higher dissolved oxygen levels in the root zone of most crops results in a higher root mass. A plant with more root mass grows healthier and faster. A plant’s roots are where it gets the majority of its inputs for growth, including water and nutrients.

How does oxygen affect the photosynthesis of land plants?
---------------------------------------------------------

Undoubtedly, therefore, oxygen in normal air exerts a strong inhibitory effect on photosynthetic Co 2 fixation of land plants under natural conditions. The inhibitory effect of oxygen is rapidly produced and fully reversible. The degree of inhibition is independent of light intensity.

How does reducing the amount of oxygen affect the atmosphere?
-------------------------------------------------------------

“Reducing oxygen levels thins the atmosphere, allowing more sunlight to reach Earth’s surface,” explains Poulsen. More sunlight lets more moisture evaporate from the planet’s surface, which increases humidity. Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, more heat gets trapped near Earth’s surface, and temperatures rise.

How does carbon dioxide affect the rate of photosynthesis?
----------------------------------------------------------

Carbon dioxide – with water – is one of the reactants in photosynthesis. If the concentration of carbon dioxide is increased, the rate of photosynthesis will therefore increase. Again, at some point, a factor may become limiting.

How does lack of water affect the photosynthesis process?
---------------------------------------------------------

If a plant doesn’t have the correct amount of water for the process of photosynthesis then the plant’s output of oxygen decreases as well. With that, since there is little water, the plants will die eventually.
