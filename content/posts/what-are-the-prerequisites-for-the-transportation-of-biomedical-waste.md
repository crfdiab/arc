-------------------------------------

Uranium is mainly used as fuel in nuclear power reactors for electricity generation. Beyond providing about 14% of the world’s electricity, there are many major other uses of uranium through the production of radio-isotopes, including: Medicine: radio-isotopes are used for diagnosis and research.

How are drivers trained to transport radioactive materials?
-----------------------------------------------------------
