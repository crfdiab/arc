What are the effects of prevailing winds?
-----------------------------------------

Prevailing winds bring air from one type of climate to another. For example, warm winds that travel over water tend to collect moisture as they travel; the water vapor in the air will condense as it moves into colder climates, which is why temperate coastal areas often receive heavy rainfall.

How does the prevailing wind affect the climate?
------------------------------------------------

Prevailing wind – The prevailing wind is the most frequent wind direction a location experiences. In Britain the prevailing wind is from the South West, which brings warm, moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. When prevailing winds blow over land areas it can contribute to creating desert climates.

Do prevailing winds affect weather?
-----------------------------------

Global winds are the prevailing, or usual, winds at a given latitude. The winds move air masses, which causes weather. The direction of prevailing winds determines which type of air mass usually moves over an area. For example, a west wind might bring warm moist air from over an ocean.

How do prevailing winds work?
-----------------------------

Prevailing winds are winds that blow from a single direction over a specific area of the Earth. Areas where prevailing winds meet are called convergence zones. Generally, prevailing winds blow east-west rather than north-south. This happens because Earth’s rotation generates what is known as the Coriolis effect.

How are prevailing winds a source of energy?
--------------------------------------------

ENERGY EDUCATION. Prevailing winds are winds that blow consistently in a given direction over a particular region on Earth. Due to factors such as uneven heating from the Sun and the Earth’s rotation, these winds vary at different latitudes on Earth.

How does prevailing winds affect climate in North America?
----------------------------------------------------------

This makes the west slopes of the Cascade Mountain range to be one of the wettest places in North America while the east slopes remain semi-arid. Prevailing Winds can also regulate the temperature of a climate.

How are prevailing winds related to rainfall gradients?
-------------------------------------------------------

Prevailing winds in mountain locations can lead to significant rainfall gradients, ranging from wet across windward-facing slopes to desert -like conditions along their lee slopes. Prevailing winds can vary due to the uneven heating of the Earth.

How are prevailing winds different in mountain locations?
---------------------------------------------------------

Prevailing winds. Prevailing winds in mountain locations can lead to significant rainfall gradients within the topography, ranging from wet across windward-facing slopes to desert -like conditions along their lee slopes. Prevailing winds can have differences due to the uneven heating of the Earth.
