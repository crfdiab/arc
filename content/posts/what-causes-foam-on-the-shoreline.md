What causes foam on the shoreline?
----------------------------------

When large blooms of algae decay offshore, great amounts of decaying algal matter often wash ashore. Foam forms as this organic matter is churned up by the surf. Most sea foam is not harmful to humans and is often an indication of a productive ocean ecosystem.

What is the froth on a lake?
----------------------------

Foam  
Foam is a natural phenomenon that occurs on many lakes and streams. Foam is produced when molecules such as fatty acids act as ‘surfactants’ interfering with the surface tension of water and allowing air and water to mix more easily. These molecules often float on the surface of the water as a thin film.

What causes foam in lakes and rivers?
-------------------------------------

In lakes, ponds and reservoirs, wind-induced currents and waves cause turbulent mixing of air and water. Boating activity may also contribute to this turbulence. Foaming will often increase during runoff from snowmelt or rainstorms that transport the surfactants to surface waters.

What causes foam?
-----------------

The development of foam occurs due to changes in the water surface tension and the physical introduction of air. There is a slight tension on the surface of water caused by the chemical attraction among water molecules.

Is seafoam a fish poop?
-----------------------

Sea foam is caused my the turbulent water making foam out of the proteins in the water. These proteins are from stuff like marine critter poop and decaying matter. It’s like whipped cream, but the cream is gross stuff.

Is seafoam a sperm fish?
------------------------

Is Sea Foam Wale Sperm? No, Sea Foam is not whale sperm. Sea Foam created by the agitation of sea H2O containing high concentrations of dissolved organic matter including proteins, lignins &amp; lipids derived from sources such as the offshore breakdown of algal blooms.

Is lake foam dangerous?
-----------------------

Is foam harmful? Foam is usually harmless. In fact, only 1 percent of the foam you see on a waterbody is the actual foaming agent; the rest is air and water. However, excess foam is sometimes the result of too much phosphorus in the water.

Is the foam in the ocean whale sperm?
-------------------------------------

whale semen. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it is actually called Sea Foam and it’s a natural occurrence that has nothing to do with whale juice.

Is foam in rivers dangerous?
----------------------------

What are examples of foam?
--------------------------

Examples of Foam Examples of foams formed by gases in liquids include whipped cream, fire retardant foam, and soap bubbles. Rising bread dough may be considered a semisolid foam. Solid foams include dry wood, polystyrene foam, memory foam, and mat foam (as for camping and yoga mats).

Why do you remove foam when cooking?
------------------------------------

Some cooks insist that to allow the foam to remain in the pot will cause it to disperse and disappear. Most authorities agree that skimming the foam will improve the clarity of the broth/stock, and it definitely will prevent contaminating the fat that renders out of the meat. Skimming the foam is useful, not vital.

Is seafoam a whale sperm?
-------------------------

What causes foam to form on the shore of a lake?
------------------------------------------------

Foam often is seen accumulating against logs or on the banks of streams, or along the shores of lakes on windy days. When it first appears, foam can be white, but generally turns brown over time. The development of foam occurs due to changes in the water surface tension and the physical introduction of air.

Where does the foam in the water come from?
-------------------------------------------

Foam is produced as air, introduced in the turbulence of stream riffles, below waterfalls, or as waves break upon the shore, bubbles to the water surface. There are many natural and synthetic (human produced) surfactant molecules.

Why is foam found in brown water streams?
-----------------------------------------

Foam often is seen in our brown-water streams in the spring as snowmelt carries DOC to adjacent streams and lakes or during fall rain storms after the leaves have fallen and begun to decompose. In addition to causing foam, DOC provides energy and performs many additional functions important to aquatic ecosystems.

Is the sea foam harmful to the environment?
-------------------------------------------

Most sea foam is not harmful to humans and is often an indication of a productive ocean ecosystem. But when large harmful algal blooms decay near shore, there are potential for impacts to human health and the environment.
