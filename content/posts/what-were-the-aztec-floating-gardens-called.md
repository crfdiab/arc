What were the Aztec floating gardens called?
--------------------------------------------

Chinampa, also called floating garden, small, stationary, artificial island built on a freshwater lake for agricultural purposes. Chinampan was the ancient name for the southwestern region of the Valley of Mexico, the region of Xochimilco, and it was there that the technique was—and is still—most widely used.

What was the name of the floating gardens that were built around Lake Texcoco?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At 2,100 square miles, Lake Texcoco was not an easy environment to make livable. But the Aztecs converted much of the nearby freshwater lakes and swampland into floating gardens, called chinampas, and enjoyed multiple harvests per year.

What did the Aztecs built on Lake Texcoco?
------------------------------------------

The Aztec built their capital city, Tenochtitlan, on Lake Texcoco. Built on two islands, the area was extended using chinampas—small, artificial islands created above the waterline that were later consolidated. Tenochtitlan eventually reached an area of more than 13 square kilometers (five square miles).

What did Aztecs grow in the floating gardens?
---------------------------------------------

The floating gardens were actually rafts. The gardens were used to grow chili peppers, corn, tomatoes, beans, and squash. It was somewhat difficult to harvest the food since the gardens were floating in marsh water. To solve this, Aztec engineers built mud and stone walls around each floating garden.

Did Aztecs build floating gardens?
----------------------------------

Called chinampas, these floating gardens were built by the Aztecs to feed a growing population. In 1985, when an earthquake struck Mexico City, many chinampas were abandoned as people who had lost their homes built shanty towns.

Did chinampas really float?
---------------------------

Sometimes referred to as “floating gardens,” chinampas are artificial islands that were created by interweaving reeds with stakes beneath the lake’s surface, creating underwater fences. The bodies of land appeared to be “floating” on the water because the canals surrounded the chinampa plots.

Why did Aztecs make floating gardens?
-------------------------------------

To feed their enormous population, the Aztecs ingeniously built chinampas, or floating gardens, to convert the marshy wetlands of Lake Texcoco into arable farmland. These floating gardens were a masterpiece of engineering. The Aztec religion was a cult of sacrifice, and the gods were fearsome.

Why did Aztecs use chinampas?
-----------------------------

The Aztecs used stunning floating gardens — otherwise known as chinampas — to grow their crops without harming the environment. The resulting system of canals and gardens created a habitat for fish and birds, which helped maintain the health of the ecosystem and also provided additional sources of food.

What did the Aztecs put on almost all of their food?
----------------------------------------------------

While the Aztecs ruled, they farmed large areas of land. Staples of their diet were maize, beans and squash. To these, they added chilies and tomatoes. Chiles, of course – including what is thought to be the wild precursor to the Poblano- were liberally used throughout nearly all dishes.

What was the floating gardens of Mexico known for?
--------------------------------------------------

How did the Aztecs make the Lake Texcoco livable?
-------------------------------------------------

What was the problem with the Tenochtitlan floating gardens?
------------------------------------------------------------

Chinampas: Aztec Floating Gardens When the Aztecs first established Tenochtitlan, they faced plenty of difficulties with growing food. There was erosion and flooding to contend with, as well as loss of soil fertility and steep slopes that didn’t support plant growth.

How did the Aztecs build their floating farms?
----------------------------------------------

They then built a restraining wall to form a step in the hillside so that the land on the step can be used for crops. The chinampas farms were man-made plots of land built up from the sedimentation from the bottom of the lake.
