How does wavelength change with frequency?
------------------------------------------

Frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional to each other. The wave with the greatest frequency has the shortest wavelength. Twice the frequency means one-half the wavelength. For this reason, the wavelength ratio is the inverse of the frequency ratio.

How do the wavelengths and frequencies of colors change?
--------------------------------------------------------

Each visible color has a wavelength. As you move from red to violet, the wavelength decreases and energy increases. Here are the 7 from shortest to longest wavelength. Violet – shortest wavelength, around 400-420 nanometers with highest frequency.

How does wavelength relate to frequency sound?
----------------------------------------------

The relationship of the speed of sound, its frequency, and wavelength is the same as for all waves: vw = fλ, where vw is the speed of sound, f is its frequency, and λ is its wavelength. The frequency is the same as that of the source and is the number of waves that pass a point per unit time.

Why does the wavelength decrease as the frequency increases?
------------------------------------------------------------

The wavelength of the wave is inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave as the speed of the wave remains constant. Therefore, the frequency of a wave increases as the wavelength decreases because the wave speed remains constant.

Can frequency change?
---------------------

Frequency doesn’t change because it depends on travelling of waves across the interface. But speed and wavelength change as the material on the other side may be different, so now it might have a longer/shorter size of wave and so the number of waves per unit time changes.

Does speed affect frequency and wavelength?
-------------------------------------------

The wavelength of a wave does not affect the speed at which the wave travels. Both Wave C and Wave D travel at the same speed. The speed of a wave is only altered by alterations in the properties of the medium through which it travels. 3.

What color has lowest frequency?
--------------------------------

red  
The lowest frequency of visible light, which is red, has the least energy.

How does temperature affect wavelength of sound?
------------------------------------------------

The wavelength is changing with the changing of the temperature, because the speed of sound changes with the temperature. The air pressure and the acoustic pressure p is irrelevant, when talking about the wavelength. Thus, when the speed of sound c changes than also the frequency f (the pitch) changes.

Is energy directly proportional to frequency?
---------------------------------------------

The energy of a photon is directly proportional to the frequency of the radiation, with a constant of proportionality called Planck’s constant.

What increases as frequency increases?
--------------------------------------

When the frequency of a wave increases, what also increases is the energy that is propagated from the source that produces the waves. Sound waves are another example where a relationship of direct proportionality, between the energy and the frequency, is observed.

What happens when frequency increases?
--------------------------------------

From these equations you may realize that as the frequency increases, the wavelength gets shorter. As the frequency decreases, the wavelength gets longer. Mechanical and electromagnetic waves with long wavelengths contain less energy than waves with short wavelengths.

How are frequency and wavelength related to each other?
-------------------------------------------------------

They are all related by one important equation: Any electromagnetic wave’s frequency multiplied by its wavelength equals the speed of light. We can use this relationship to figure out the wavelength or frequency of any electromagnetic wave if we have the other measurement.

How does the frequency of an electromagnetic wave change?
---------------------------------------------------------

As the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave get shorter its frequency increases and as wavelength gets longer its frequency decreases. As the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave get shorter and its frequency increases and the amount of energy it transports becomes greater.

Why are waves with longer wavelengths carry more energy?
--------------------------------------------------------

Waves with longer wavelengths have a lower frequency and carry less energy. Waves with shorter wavelengths have a higher frequency and carry more energy. Remember that:

How is the energy of light related to the frequency?
----------------------------------------------------

and energy equals Planck’s constant times the frequency, or. E = h × ν. Where: λ is the wavelength. ν is the frequency. E is the energy. c is the speed of light, c = 299,792,458 m/s (186,212 miles/second) h is Planck’s constant, h = 6.626 x 10 -27 erg-seconds.
