What’s the best way to lay a lasagna?
-------------------------------------

Chef’s Tip: In order to ensure that a lasagna holds its shape after it is cut and plated, many Italians alternate the orientation of their pasta with each layer. So if you lay your first layer of pasta lengthwise, you will lay your second layer crosswise, alternating each time.

What kind of cheese do you use for lasagna?
-------------------------------------------

1 1 lb lasagna noodles or sheets (use pasta from Italy, or homemade, for best results) 2 10 oz shredded mozzarella cheese (whole milk, low moisture) I recommend shredding your own cheese or you can also use fresh mozzarella, cut into small pieces 3 2 Tbsp grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese to sprinkle on top

Which is better for lasagna dried or fresh?
-------------------------------------------

Although some Italians will buy these strips dried, it’s still quite common in Emilia-Romagna to make them at home, along with other regional specialties like tortellini. Fresh sheets of egg pasta always taste better in lasagna than dried ones.
