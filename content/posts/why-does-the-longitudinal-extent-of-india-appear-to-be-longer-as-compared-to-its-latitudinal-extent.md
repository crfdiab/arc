Why does the longitudinal extent of India appear to be longer as compared to its latitudinal extent?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The latitudinal and longitudinal extent of India is about 30o. The North-South extent is 3214 km and East-West extent is 2933 km. India is away from the equator. So, the lines of longitude come nearer and the East-West distance becomes less than the North-South distance.

Why does north South extent appear smaller?
-------------------------------------------

North-south extent appears to be smaller than the east-west extent. Hint: Because of the way that latitudes are equidistant from one another yet the distance between longitudes diminishes as one moves from equator to poles.

Why is it inspite of having an almost equal latitudinal and longitudinal extent the north South extent is greater than the east west extent km?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the fact that Latitudinal and longitudinal extent of mainland India is about 30°. Despite of it, N-S extent is greater than E-W extent. As can be seen in the following figure: As we move from South to North the distance between two longitude decreases from equator (111km) to poles(0 km).

What is the north South extent of India in degrees?
---------------------------------------------------

The north-south extent of India in terms of distance is 3214 km from Ladakh to Cape Comorin, near Kanyakumari. The longitudinal extent of India is 68°7’E and 97°25’E.

What is the east to west extent of India?
-----------------------------------------

2,933 km  
India measures 3,214 km (1,997 mi) from north to south and 2,933 km (1,822 mi) from east to west.

Why 82 degree 30 minutes east has been?
---------------------------------------

Answer: From Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh there is a time lag of two hours. Hence, time along the Standard Meridian of India (82° 30′ E) passing through Mirzapur (in Uttar Pradesh) is taken as the standard time for the whole country.

Why does India have a longitudinal extent of 30o has only one time zone?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

India with a longitudinal extent of 30 degree have only one time zone Because we all want to have the same time that is to easy our time zone we have taken standard meridian for whole country.

What is India’s latitudinal extent?
-----------------------------------

India is a vast country. Lying entirely in the Northern hemisphere (Figure 1.1) the main land extends between latitudes 8°4’N and 37°6’N and longitudes 68°7’E and 97°25’E.

What is the latitudinal extension of India?
-------------------------------------------

What is the national capital of India?
--------------------------------------

New Delhi  
India/Capitals  
New Delhi is the capital of India and one of Delhi city’s 11 districts. Although colloquially Delhi and New Delhi are used interchangeably to refer to the National Capital Territory of Delhi, these are two distinct entities, with New Delhi forming a small part of Delhi.

Which is longer north south or east west in India?
--------------------------------------------------

Latitudinal and longitudinal extent of India are 30 degrees. Then why is the North-South extent longer than the East-West extent? We know that the latitudinal and longitudinal extent of India are 30º. We also know the fact that North-South extent longer than the East-West extent.

Why is the east west extent smaller than the north south extent?
----------------------------------------------------------------

This one’s interesting!! We know that latitudes are equidistant from each other, but Distance between longitudes decreases as one moves from equator to poles. Therefore, the east west extent that longitudinal appears to be smaller than the north south or latitudinal extent! Cheers!

Why is the latitude and longitude extent of India is 30?
--------------------------------------------------------

Originally Answered: Latitude and longitude extent of India is 30. Thenexplain why is the north south extent brigger than the east west extent? Its because latitudes are parallel at every where from 0 degree to 90degree north and south. the distance between two latitudes is aprox 110 km at every where from north to south.

Why is the north south axis bigger in India?
--------------------------------------------

In the drift of the tectonic plate over a span of the measure of the Indian Ocean, it looked like a counter clockwise spin, which extended the north south axis as we see it before the collusion. (Spiral twist). The landmass was longer when it floated freely before the collusion millions of years ago. The Indian plate mass hitting Eu… Loading…
