How does a heat wave form?
--------------------------

How do heat waves form? Heat waves form when high pressure air settles high in the air and causes hot air to sink down. The hot air sinking creates a bubble that acts like a seal and traps heat near the ground. These heat waves can last from days to weeks.

How often does a heat wave occur?
---------------------------------

Heat waves are occurring more often than they used to in major cities across the United States. Their frequency has increased steadily, from an average of two heat waves per year during the 1960s to six per year during the 2010s (see Figure 1).

Where do heat waves occur the most?
-----------------------------------

Summers in North America are hot, meaning most parts of the US experience heat waves during the summer. The region east of the Rockies tend feel heat waves with high temperature and humidity.

When was the worst heat wave?
-----------------------------

The 1936 North American heat wave was one of the most severe heat waves in the modern history of North America. It took place in the middle of the Great Depression and Dust Bowl of the 1930s and caused catastrophic human suffering and an enormous economic toll.

How long can a heat wave last?
------------------------------

The Short Answer: A heat wave is a period of unusually hot weather that typically lasts two or more days. To be considered a heat wave, the temperatures have to be outside the historical averages for a given area.

How does heat wave cause death?
-------------------------------

Heat stress causes loss of salt and water in sweat, causing haemoconcentration, which in turn causes increases in coronary and cerebral thrombosis. Other deaths in heat waves are probably due to overload of already failing hearts, unable to meet the need for increased cutaneous blood flow in the heat.

What should you not do during a heat wave?
------------------------------------------

Don’t drink alcohol, sugary soda, coffee, energy drinks, or other caffeinated beverages, as they dehydrate you! That’s the last thing you need during a heat wave.

What is the hottest day ever on Earth?
--------------------------------------

July 10, 1913  
Masters writes the World Meteorological Organization awards the all-time world record to a 134° reading taken in Death Valley on July 10, 1913.

What causes a heat wave in an area?
-----------------------------------

What Causes A Heat Wave? A heatwave occurs when a system of high atmospheric pressure moves into an area and lasts two or more days. In such a high-pressure system, air from upper levels of our atmosphere is pulled toward the ground, where it becomes compressed and increases in temperature.

Why does a heat wave last for so long?
--------------------------------------

In such a high-pressure system, air from upper levels of our atmosphere is pulled toward the ground, where it becomes compressed and increases in temperature. This high concentration of pressure makes it difficult for other weather systems to move into the area, which is why a heat wave can last for several days or weeks.

When does a heat wave occur in Texas?
-------------------------------------

That being said, heat waves can occur in Texas, too, if the high and low temperatures exceed what’s usual for the state during a particular period of time. Heat waves occur wherever a mid-level high-pressure system develops over an area.

How does sinking air affect a heat wave?
----------------------------------------

The sinking air acts like a cap. It traps warm ground air in place. Without rising air, there was no rain, and nothing to prevent the hot air from getting hotter. High-pressure systems can create a ‘cap’ that traps air in one place as it warms.
