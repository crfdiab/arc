How can we protect humans during and after a volcano?
-----------------------------------------------------

During a Volcanic Eruption

1. Wear a dust mask designed to protect against lung irritation from small particles.
2. Protect your eyes by wearing goggles. Wear eyeglasses, not contact lenses.
3. Keep as much of your skin covered as possible.

How can we help people after volcanic eruptions?

What to do after a volcanic eruption

1. Listen to your local radio stations for civil defence advice and follow instructions.
2. Stay indoors and away from volcanic ashfall areas as much as possible.
3. When it is safe to go outside, keep your gutters and roof clear of ash as heavy ash deposits can collapse your roof.

What happens to volcano after it erupts?
----------------------------------------

The space for the magma to leave is very small and, as it travels, pressure builds, meaning it escapes violently when released. This escaping liquid rock becomes lava, which solidifies as it travels. Layers of lava build up over time, creating volcanoes.

What would happen if volcano?
-----------------------------

The enormous amount of volcanic material in the atmosphere would subsequently rain down toxic ash; across the entire US, but principally in the Northwest. The ash would also kill plants, animals, crush buildings with its weight, block freeways, and ruin the country’s farmland for a generation.

What should you do after a volcanic eruption?
---------------------------------------------

You can do many things to protect yourself and your family after a volcanic eruption: Pay attention to warnings, and obey instructions from local authorities. For example, stay indoors until local health officials tell you it is safe to go outside.

How can you protect yourself from volcanic ash?
-----------------------------------------------

Exposure to ash can harm your health, particularly the respiratory (breathing) tract. To protect yourself while you are outdoors or while you are cleaning up ash that has gotten indoors, a disposable particulate respirator (also known as an “air purifying respirator”) may be considered.

What happens to your home during a volcano eruption?
----------------------------------------------------

Be very cautious when working on a roof. Ash can be slippery and make it easy to fall. Volcanic eruptions may result in floods, landslides and mudslides, power outages, and wildfires. For information on protecting yourself against these hazards, visit the following:

What should I put in my emergency kit for a volcano?
----------------------------------------------------

Another vital preparation step is assembling an emergency kit that includes supplies like food, water, respiratory protection, eye protection, and a battery-powered radio. When preparing your kit, consider each member of your family and their needs— and don’t forget your pets.
