How does water move through a drainage basin?
---------------------------------------------

Outputs move moisture out of the drainage basin and include evaporation and transpiration from vegetation (together known as evapotranspiration), run-off into the sea and percolation of water to underlying rock strata into underground stores.

What is an example of a drainage basin?
---------------------------------------

A drainage basin is the area of land that provides all water for a river that eventually exits to another body of water (another river, a lake, sea or ocean). For example, all water in the Missouri River drainage basin exits to the Mississippi River.

Where is water stored in a drainage basin?
------------------------------------------

Water is stored in a drainage basin on the surface in lakes and channels or underground in the groundwater store. Water reaches the groundwater store via the processes of infiltration and percolation. During these processes, some water will be stored in the soil and rock.

What is the main input to a drainage basin?
-------------------------------------------

The drainage basin has inputs and outputs, and water in the system is either transferred or stored. The main input to the system is precipitation. The type of precipitation (rain or snow, etc), the intensity, the duration and frequency all have an effect on the amount of water in the system.

What is the drainage basin of a river?
--------------------------------------

A drainage basin is the area of land around the river that is drained by the river and its tributaries . Watershed – the area of high land forming the edge of a river basin. Source – where a river begins. Mouth – where a river meets the sea.

What do you mean by a river basin?
----------------------------------

A river drainage basin is an area drained by a river and all of its tributaries. A river basin is made up of many different watersheds. A watershed is a small version of a river basin. Every stream and tributary has its own watershed, which drains to a larger stream or wetland.

Drainage basin is also called catchment, catchment area, catchment basin, drainage area, river basin, and water basin. It is an area of land. All water that falls on that land flows into one river. What is a watershed on a river?

When do you get overland flow in a drainage basin?
--------------------------------------------------

You can also get overland flow when you have a lot of impermeable rocks that water can’t permeate through. Overland flow is fastest when the water is travelling down a steep sided hill and almost non-existent when the land is flat. I used a term called infiltrationin the previous paragraph.

How does the shape of a drainage basin affect runoff?
-----------------------------------------------------

The shape of the drainage basin also affects runoff and discharge. Drainage basins that are more circular in shape lead to shorter lag times and a higher peak discharge than those that are long and thin because water has a shorter distance to travel to reach a river.

How is water transferred in the global hydrological cycle?
----------------------------------------------------------

Water is continuously transferred between the atmosphere and the oceans. This is known as the global hydrological cycle. This system is a closed system. There are no inputs or outputs. The drainage basin hydrological system is a local open system. A drainage basin is an area of land drained by a river and its tributaries (river system).
