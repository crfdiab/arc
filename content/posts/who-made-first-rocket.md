-----------------------------------

Hermann Oberth: Father of Space Travel. Hermann Julius Oberth, born June 25, 1894 in the Transylvanian town of Hermannstadt, is, along with the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and the American Robert Goddard, one of the three founding fathers of rocketry and modern astronautics.

What is Russian space agency called?
------------------------------------

Roskosmos  
Roskosmos, in full Russian Federal Space Agency, Russian Federalnoye Kosmicheskoye Agentsvo, Russian government organization founded in 1992 that is responsible for managing the Russian space program.

Who theorized space travel?
---------------------------

Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the Russian father of rocketry, was a self-educated man, but he developed insights into space travel and rocket science that are still in use over a hundred years later, earning him a place in history as one of the pioneers of astronautics.

Who is considered the father of rocket propulsion?
--------------------------------------------------

Dr. Robert Hutchings Goddard (1882-1945) is considered the father of modern rocket propulsion. A physicist of great insight, Goddard also had a unique genius for invention. It is in memory of this brilliant scientist that NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, was established on May 1, 1959.

Who was the first scientist to invent a rocket?
-----------------------------------------------

A physicist of great insight, Goddard also had a unique genius for invention.

When did Konstantin Tsiolkovsky develop his rocket theory?
----------------------------------------------------------

This occupied his time during the war years until the Russian Revolution in 1917. Starting in 1896, Tsiolkovsky systematically studied the theory of motion of rocket apparatus. Thoughts on the use of the rocket principle in the cosmos were expressed by him as early as 1883, and a rigorous theory of rocket propulsion was developed in 1896.
