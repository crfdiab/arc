What are some characteristics of rivers?
----------------------------------------

A river is a ribbon-like body of water that flows downhill from the force of gravity. A river can be wide and deep, or shallow enough for a person to wade across. A flowing body of water that is smaller than a river is called a stream, creek, or brook.

What are the characteristics of rivers and streams?
---------------------------------------------------

Key Characteristics of Rivers and Streams. Streams or rivers form when water that does not find an underground aquifer, drains off the land by either seeping through the soil or spilling over the surface into the river or stream bed. Water in streams and rivers is in constant motion.

What are some characteristics of an ecosystem?
----------------------------------------------

Most ecosystems characteristically possess a well-defined soil, climate, flora and fauna (or communities) and have their own potential for adaptation, change and tolerance. The functioning of any ecosystem involves a series of cycles, e.g., the water cycle and the cycles of various nutrients.

What function do rivers play in the ecosystem?
----------------------------------------------

River systems provide diverse ecosystem services (ES), such as flood regulation (regulating), fresh water (provisioning), nutrient cycling (supporting), and recreation (cultural), among others.

How are rivers useful to us?
----------------------------

Rivers carry water and nutrients to areas all around the earth. They play a very important part in the water cycle, acting as drainage channels for surface water. Rivers drain nearly 75% of the earth’s land surface. Rivers provide excellent habitat and food for many of the earth’s organisms.

What are the different parts of a river?
----------------------------------------

The upper course, middle course, and lower course are the three parts of the river. The source of a river can be found on the upper course. The land is usually high and mountainous, and the river has a steep gradient with fast-flowing water.

What do all rivers have in common?
----------------------------------

It’s All Connected From space, rivers and streams look like veins on the Earth’s surface. Rivers and streams connect with each other in a system called a watershed. There are three types of watersheds. The rivers and streams in a closed watershed empty into an inland body of water like a lake.

What are the characteristics of a river ecosystem?
--------------------------------------------------

River ecosystems have: flowing water that is mostly unidirectional. a state of continuous physical change. many different (and changing) microhabitats. variability in the flow rates of water. plants and animals that have adapted to live within water flow conditions.

How are river ecosystems affected by human society?
---------------------------------------------------

River ecosystems are amongst the ecosystems with the largest rates of biodiversity loss (Dudgeon et al., 2006), and, especially in water-scarce areas, human societies allocate only a small volume of water (Arthington et al., 2006). K.E. Limburg, D.L. Strayer, in Encyclopedia of Biodiversity, 2001

How is the chemistry of a river system determined?
--------------------------------------------------

The chemistry of the water varies from one river ecosystem to another. It is often determined by inputs from the surrounding environment or catchment area but can also be influenced by rain and the addition of pollution from human sources. Oxygen is the most important chemical constituent of river systems – most organisms need it for survival.

What are the characteristics of a transitional ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------------------

While the so-called transitional ecosystems are those that occur between water and land, such as the banks of rivers or swamps. In an ecosystem living beings share the quest for food to survive. In the case of animals competition for food is combined with the need not to be devoured in that attempt.
