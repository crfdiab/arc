Why did the trail to Oregon Follow Rivers?
------------------------------------------

It was used during the 19th century by Great Plains pioneers who were seeking fertile land in the West and North. As the trail developed it became marked by numerous cutoffs and shortcuts from Missouri to Oregon. The basic route follows river valleys as grass and water were absolutely necessary.

What river did the Oregon Trail follow?
---------------------------------------

Willamette River valley  
Oregon Trail, also called Oregon-California Trail, in U.S. history, an overland trail between Independence, Missouri, and Oregon City, near present-day Portland, Oregon, in the Willamette River valley.

Why were rivers dangerous on the Oregon Trail?
----------------------------------------------

Swollen rivers could tip over a wagon and drown both people and oxen and valuable supplies, goods, and equipment could be lost. Sometimes this was caused by animals panicking when wading through deep, swift water.

What was the effect of the Oregon Trail?

Near the junction of the Raft River and the Snake River, the California Trail diverged from the Oregon Trail at another Parting of the Ways junction. Travellers left the Snake River and followed Raft River about 65 miles (105 km) southwest past present day Almo, Idaho.

Where was the jumping off point for the Oregon Trail?
-----------------------------------------------------

Initially, the main “jumping off point” was the common head of the Santa Fe Trail and Oregon Trail—Independence, Missouri/Kansas City, Kansas. Travelers starting in Independence had to ferry across the Missouri River.

Why was the Oregon Trail considered too demanding?
