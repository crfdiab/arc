Does sound travel faster through air or concrete?
-------------------------------------------------

Review: The speed of sound is faster in solid materials and slower in liquids or gases. The speed of a sound wave is related to the elastic properties and density of the medium it is in.

What is the speed of sound in rock?
-----------------------------------

The velocity of sound is 5.435 km/sec at 2o0 C., and this increases one-third of i per cent as the temperature rises to 300° C. This gives a positive temperature coefficient of velocity equal to +0.11 per cent per hundred degrees.

In which metal speed of sound is highest?
-----------------------------------------

steel  
Since density of steel is highest among the other given options, the speed of sound is maximum in steel.

What absorbs sound the most?
----------------------------

In general, soft, pliable, or porous materials (like cloths) serve as good acoustic insulators – absorbing most sound, whereas dense, hard, impenetrable materials (such as metals) reflect most.

What material has the highest speed of sound?
---------------------------------------------

diamond  
In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (39,000 ft/s),— about 35 times its speed in air and about the fastest it can travel under normal conditions.

In which metal sound speed is maximum?
--------------------------------------

What is the speed of sound in water?
------------------------------------

Speed of sound in common solids and metals – aluminum, brass, concrete and Speed of sound in normal air is 343 m/s. In water the speed of sound is 1433 m/s. Speed of Sound in some common solids are indicated in the table below:

How fast does sound travel through different materials?
-------------------------------------------------------

In case you’re curious just how quickly sound travels through different mediums, here are a few of the different materials and how fast sound moves through them: Rubber — 60 m/s Air at 32 degrees — 331 m/s Air at 68 degrees — 343 m/s Air at 104 degrees — 355 m/s Lead — 1210 m/s Gold — 3240 m/s Glass — 4540 m/s Copper — 4600 m/s

What is the speed of sound in metals?
-------------------------------------

Speed of Sound in common Solids and Metals. Speed of sound in some common solids and metals – like aluminum, brass, concrete and Speed of sound in normal air is 343 m/s. In water the speed of sound is 1433 m/s. Sound velocity in some common solids are indicated in the table below: Solid.

What is the speed of sound in silica?
-------------------------------------

Speed of Sound in some common solids are indicated in the table below: Solid Speed of Sound (m/s) Speed of Sound (m/s) Speed of Sound (m/s) Silica, fused 5968 3764 5760 Silver 3650 1610 2680 Slate 4510 Steel (1% C) 5940 3220 5180
