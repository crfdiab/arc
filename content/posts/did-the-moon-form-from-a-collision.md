Did the Moon form from a collision?
-----------------------------------

The giant-impact hypothesis, sometimes called the Big Splash, or the Theia Impact, suggests that the Moon formed from the ejecta of a collision between the proto-Earth and a Mars-sized planet, approximately 4.5 billion years ago, in the Hadean eon (about 20 to 100 million years after the Solar System coalesced).

What is NASA finding on the Moon through research?
--------------------------------------------------

Scientists using NASA’s telescope on an airplane, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, discovered water on a sunlit surface of the Moon for the first time. Molecular water, H2O, was found in Clavius Crater, one of the largest craters visible from Earth in the Moon’s southern hemisphere.

What happened planet Theia?
---------------------------

After slamming into Earth, the outer rocky shells of both Earth and Theia were blasted into a disk of debris around our planet. From this disk, the Moon coalesced; thus, models indicate most of Theia’s material ended up as part of the Moon. Any iron core that Theia may have had was consumed by Earth’s own core.

What kind of experiments does the US government do?
---------------------------------------------------

The U.S. Government has been caught conducting an insane amount of vile, inhumane and grisly experiments on humans without their consent and often without their knowledge.

How are Radiation Experiments done in the United States?
--------------------------------------------------------

Human radiation experiments. Researchers in the United States have performed thousands of human radiation experiments to determine the effects of atomic radiation and radioactive contamination on the human body, generally on people who were poor, sick, or powerless.

How did the US test the atomic bomb on humans?
----------------------------------------------

While testing out and trying to harness the power of the atomic bomb, U.S. scientists also secretly tested the bomb’s effects on humans. During the Manhattan Project, which gave way to the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, U.S. scientists resorted to secret human testing via plutonium injection on 18 unsuspecting\]

Why was the nuclear strike on the Moon cancelled?
-------------------------------------------------

The final stage of the project, E-4, was to be a nuclear strike on the Moon as a display of force. As with the American plan, the E series of projects was canceled while still in its planning stages due to concerns regarding the safety and reliability of the launch vehicle.
