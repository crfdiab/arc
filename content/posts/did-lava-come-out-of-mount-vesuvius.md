Did lava come out of Mount Vesuvius?
------------------------------------

Vesuvius was active from 1913 through 1944, with lava filling the crater and occasional outflows of small amounts of lava. That eruptive period ended in the major eruption of March 1944, which destroyed the villages of San Sebastiano al Vesuvio, Massa di Somma, and Ottaviano, and part of San Giorgio a Cremano.

Did Pompeii get covered in lava?
--------------------------------

The city of Pompeii is famous because it was destroyed in 79 CE when a nearby volcano, Mount Vesuvius, erupted, covering it in at least 19 feet (6 metres) of ash and other volcanic debris.

What happened when the volcano Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year 79 AD?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the late summer or autumn of 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius violently spewed forth a deadly cloud of super-heated tephra and gases to a height of 33 km (21 mi), ejecting molten rock, pulverized pumice and hot ash at 1.5 million tons per second, ultimately releasing 100,000 times the thermal energy of the atomic bombings of â€¦

When did Mount Vesuvius erupt in 79 AD?
---------------------------------------

Eruption of Mount Vesuvius of 79 AD. On August 24 th, 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius awoke, a volcano once thought to be extinct erupted covering the surrounding cities and those that remained in it with pumice, ash and debris (Cameron, 2006).

Mount Vesuvius, a stratovolcano on the Gulf of Naples, erupted violently in the year 79 AD, destroying the resort towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum.

What was the difference between the 1944 eruption and the 79 AD eruption?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

While still a powerful and impressive sight, the 1944 eruption was far less destructive than its famous predecessor. Coming towards the end of the war the volcano did cause some problems for the invading allies by the ash damage to airplanes a problem not experienced by the earlier Roman Empire in 79 AD! Since 1944, Vesuvius has not erupted.

How did Herculaneum survive the eruption of Mount Vesuvius?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Although located some 3 miles closer to Mount Vesuvius than Pompeii, the small wealthy seaside town of Herculaneum managed to dodge the majority of the ash and pumice fall from the first eruption, thanks to prevailing winds blowing the volcanic cloud southeast towards Pompeii and the surrounding area.
