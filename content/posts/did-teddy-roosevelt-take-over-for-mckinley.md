Did Teddy Roosevelt take over for McKinley?
-------------------------------------------

After Vice President Garret Hobart died in 1899, the New York state party leadership convinced McKinley to accept Roosevelt as his running mate in the 1900 election. Roosevelt took office as vice president in 1901 and assumed the presidency at age 42 after McKinley was assassinated the following September.

Why did Roosevelt choose McKinley?
----------------------------------

Although Roosevelt was reluctant to accept the nomination for vice president, which he regarded as a relatively trivial and powerless office, his great popularity among most Republican delegates led McKinley to pick him as his new running mate.

What did McKinley want to do during his presidency?
---------------------------------------------------

Roosevelt, despite much public skepticism, vowed to preserve and expand McKinley’s programs. An important issue during McKinley’s presidency was U.S. involvement in China. In a war that started in 1894 and ended in 1895, Japan defeated China, and for the next several years China was in disarray.

What was the relationship between McKinley and de Lome?
-------------------------------------------------------

On February 9, 1898, Hearst greatly stoked the fire of anti-Spanish sentiment when he published a private letter written by Spanish diplomat Dupuy de Lome that was very critical of President McKinley. De Lome was forced to resign, but the public was angered and outraged by the sensational stories and began to call for armed intervention in Cuba.

Who was the assassin that killed President McKinley?
----------------------------------------------------

In September 1901, President McKinley was shot by an anarchist assassin named Leon Czolgosz. McKinley was expected to recover, but after several days, he died. Roosevelt was informed of the president’s death while hiking in the Adirondack Mountains of New York.

Why was the war with Japan important to McKinley?
-------------------------------------------------

An important issue during McKinley’s presidency was U.S. involvement in China. In a war that started in 1894 and ended in 1895, Japan defeated China, and for the next several years China was in disarray. In the aftermath of the war, Japan and major European powers moved in to take control of China’s substantial resources.
