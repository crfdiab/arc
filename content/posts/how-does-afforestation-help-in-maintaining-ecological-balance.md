How does afforestation help in maintaining ecological balance?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Planting trees in a depleted or recovering forests helps to restore the ecosystem of the area, but planting trees in a barren land helps to create a new ecosystem. The main purpose of afforestation is to conserve forests by planting more and more ?? in a barren land.

What is afforestation and how is it helpful?
--------------------------------------------

Afforestation helps to address all the issues of soil erosion and barren land at the same time. Trees act as wind barriers thereby weakening the speed of the wind and reducing its impact and ability to carry big soil particles.

How can afforestation be done?
------------------------------

Afforestation can be done through tree planting and seeding, naturally or artificially. Similarly, reforestation can be considered a form of afforestation. Reforestation is the alteration of a non-forested area to a forested area through tree planting and seeding.

What do you understand by afforestation?
----------------------------------------

: the act or process of establishing a forest especially on land not previously forested.

What is the importance of afforestation for our country?
--------------------------------------------------------

When we practice afforestation, we will be able to prevent soil erosion. This will, in turn, help in maintaining the fertility of the soil. Therefore, it will be beneficial for the agricultural sector. Furthermore, through afforestation, we can get ample supply of timber, fruit, fodder and more.

What is the purpose of afforestation?
-------------------------------------

By absorbing CO2, forests help to lower the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere and reduce the effects of climate change. Reforestation and afforestation help maximize these abilities of forests by increasing the overall amount of forested land on the planet.

What is afforestation and its advantages and disadvantages?
-----------------------------------------------------------

If not properly managed, afforestation can result in a reduction of local biodiversity, the modification of particular biomes, the introduction of non-native and potentially invasive species, reduced stream flow, and lost revenue from agriculture.

What is afforestation one word answer?
--------------------------------------

How does afforestation help in reducing soil erosion?
-----------------------------------------------------

We all know that the roots of trees help in binding the soil and cutting of trees is one of the main reasons of soil-erosion. Afforestation increases the number of trees and hence resolves the problem of soil erosion. There are also commercial advantages of afforestation.

Why are trees important to the afforestation process?
-----------------------------------------------------

The roots of the trees play a significant role part in binding the soil together. In this way, it prevents the process of soil erosion or desertification. This can cause many areas to turn into dry wastelands. Afforestation can help us cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, and, thus, diminishing the effects of climate change.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of afforestation?
-----------------------------------------------------------

If there are fewer numbers of trees, the level of carbon dioxide will be more in the air and vice-versa. As we know that afforestation is a process of creating a new forest, hence it can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and ultimately reduces pollution. What are the Advantages of Afforestation?

What is the difference between reforestation and afforestation?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Reforestation refers to the process of specifically planting native trees into a forest which has a decreasing number of trees. Hence, reforestation is in charge of increasing the number of trees of an existing forest. On the other hand, afforestation represents the creation of a “new” forest.
