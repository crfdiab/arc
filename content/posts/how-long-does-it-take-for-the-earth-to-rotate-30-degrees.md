How long does it take for the Earth to rotate 30 degrees?
---------------------------------------------------------

2 hours  
Answer: The Earth rotates through 15° each hour so to rotate through 30° degrees it would take 2 hours. We use a system of imaginary lines to tell us where we are on the surface of the Earth. A series of imaginary circles – called lines of latitude – tell us how far North or South of the Equator we are.

How long does it take the Earth to rotate 1 degree?
---------------------------------------------------

four minutes  
This rotation is a full 360�. So, in one hour, the earth turns 15�. Every four minutes, the earth has turned one degree.

How long does it take the Earth to rotate half a turn around its axis?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It only takes 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.0916 seconds for the Earth to turn once its axis.

How long does it take the Earth to rotate 45 degrees?
-----------------------------------------------------

At the equator, the circumference of the Earth is 40,070 kilometers, and the day is 24 hours long so the speed is 1670 kilometers/hour ( 1037 miles/hr). This decreases by the cosine of your latitude so that at a latitude of 45 degrees, cos(45) = . 707 and the speed is . 707 x 1670 = 1180 kilometers/hr.

How much does the earth rotate in 6 hours?
------------------------------------------

The Earth rotates approximately 15 degrees in one hour. This is determined by dividing the number of degrees in one full rotation (360) by the number of hours in one day.

At what speed is the Earth rotating?
------------------------------------

roughly 1,000 miles per hour  
The earth rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09053 seconds, called the sidereal period, and its circumference is roughly 40,075 kilometers. Thus, the surface of the earth at the equator moves at a speed of 460 meters per second–or roughly 1,000 miles per hour.

How long does it take for the Earth to rotate 360 degrees?
----------------------------------------------------------

360 degrees in a full rotation, divided by 24 hours is 15 degrees an hour. 60 minutes in an hour divided by fifteen degrees an hour is four minutes. Earth’s sidereal day is 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0905 seconds, or 86 164.0905 seconds. Divide by 360°. 239.3446958… seconds.

How to calculate the rotation of the Earth?
-------------------------------------------

Req= 6,371.14 km The second value is the Earth’s sidereal rotation period. We cannot use the widely used 24 hours, since that is not the Earth’s true rotation period. The “solar day” (24 hours) is based on the time required for the Sun to appear in the same part of the sky.

What happens if the Earth’s axis of rotation was 90 degrees?
------------------------------------------------------------

If the Earth’s axial tilt were 90 degrees, then the Equator, Tropics and Arctic circles would all be in the same place. The tropical and temperate zones would be a thin band around the equator. Each hemisphere would experience 24 hour days in Summer and 24 hour Winter nights.

How long does a rotation take?
------------------------------

A: A complete rotation of the earth on its axis takes approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes and four seconds with respect to the background stars.
