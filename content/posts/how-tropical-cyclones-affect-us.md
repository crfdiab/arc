How tropical cyclones affect us?
--------------------------------

People can be killed, injured, or lost during typhoons. Flooding can cause people to drown, houses to be completely destroyed, property to be swept away, and farms to lose all of their crops to the winds and relentless rains. Mudslides and power outages are common.

What damage do tropical cyclones cause?
---------------------------------------

Cyclones have gale force winds with wind gusts in excess of 90 km/h around their centre. In the most severe cyclones, gusts can exceed 280 km/h. These winds can cause extensive property damage and turn airborne debris into potentially lethal missiles.

How do cyclones affect coastal areas?
-------------------------------------

Intense tropical cyclones and ECLs are associated with strong winds, heavy rainfall and storm surge causing damage to ecosystems, property and infrastructure, and loss of life. The impacts are greatest in low-lying coastal areas. Any intensification of storms in the future will increase these risks.

What are the causes of a tropical cyclone?
------------------------------------------

According to the research, tropical cyclones are caused by rising sea surface temperatures.

What is the most devastating result of a tropical cyclone?
----------------------------------------------------------

The storm surge. In coastal regions an elevation of sea level—the storm surge—is often the deadliest phenomenon associated with tropical cyclones. Most of the surge is caused by friction between the strong winds in the storm’s eyewall and the ocean surface, which piles water up in the direction that the wind is blowing …

What are the characteristics of tropical cyclone?
-------------------------------------------------

Tropical Cyclone Characteristics

- Hurricane force winds generally extend out about 100 km (60 miles) from the centre.
- Storm force winds may extend out as much as 500 km (300 miles)
- Maximum wind speeds between 12 and 50 km from centre. What are the main effects of a tropical cyclone?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    The main effects of tropical cyclones include heavy rain, strong wind, large storm surges near landfall, and tornadoes. The destruction from a tropical cyclone, such as a hurricane or tropical storm, depends mainly on its intensity, its size, and its location.
    
    How does wind shear affect a tropical cyclone?
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    It inhibits tropical cyclones by stopping organisation of deep convection in the atmosphere, which prevents the organisation of cloud walls (Goldenberg et al, 2001). Wind shear has a big impact on hurricane frequency and intensity (Aiyyer and Thorncroft, 2006).
    
    What happens to animals when there is a cyclone?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    Flying debris, including uprooted trees, can destroy parts of forests and animal habitats. The resultant animal deaths can break the food chain causing more animals to die. When a sewage line gets damaged due to a cyclone, it can poison the environment, resulting in many animal deaths and plant destruction.
    
    Where do tropical cyclones usually go after they form?
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
    Tropical cyclones usually move westward in the tropics, and can later move north or south into the temperate zone.Tropical cyclones are powered by warm, humid ocean air. When they go onto land, they weaken. They die when they spend a long time over land or cool ocean water.
