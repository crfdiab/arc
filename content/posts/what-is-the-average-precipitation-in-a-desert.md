What is the average precipitation in a desert?
----------------------------------------------

Desert climate. An area that features this climate usually experiences from 25 to 200 mm (7.87 inches) per year of precipitation and in some years may experience no precipitation at all. Averages may be even less such as in Arica, Chile, where precipitation normals annually stand at around 1 mm per year.

Where does all the rain in the desert go?
-----------------------------------------

Desert rain often never makes it to the ocean, the streams usually end in lakes that dry up or the streams themselves just dry up. For instance, almost all of the rain that falls in Nevada never makes it to a perennial river or to the ocean.

What is the average rainfall in Death Valley?
---------------------------------------------

The official weather station in Death Valley, United States reports 60 mm (2.4 in) annually, but in a 40-month period between 1931 and 1934 a total of 16 mm (0.63 in) of rainfall was measured. There are two variations of a desert climate: a hot desert climate ( BWh ), and a cold desert climate ( BWk ).

How much of the Earth is covered in deserts?
--------------------------------------------

Deserts occupy about one-fifth of the land on Earth and appear on every continent. Little Precipitation The little precipitation and rain that falls in deserts is usually erratic and varies from year to year.

------------------------------------------------

There are two variations of a desert climate: a hot desert climate ( BWh ), and a cold desert climate ( BWk ).

Why is there so little rain in deserts?
---------------------------------------

Due to intense heat, rain is known to evaporate in hot and dry deserts before it can even reach the ground. Many semiarid deserts get so little rain because tall mountain ranges prevent precipitation from reaching these drier regions. The soil is significantly more absorbent in coastal deserts and therefore, better at supporting plant life.

What are the characteristics of a dry desert?
---------------------------------------------

Dry and hot deserts are the stereotypical deserts familiar to many people. These types of deserts experience very little rainfall, hot temperatures during the day and freezing temperatures during the night. They are characterized by sand, rocks, gravel, and a few sparse oases.
