What is the start of a tornado called?
--------------------------------------

The Forming of a Tornado When the warm air moves upward into an area of cold air, instabilities will begin to form. The cap of cold air will eventually give way, causing the storm winds to begin spinning. This will create a funnel shaped cloud.

How do you tell if a tornado is starting?
-----------------------------------------

What Are the Signs that a Tornado is Coming?

1. Approaching Cloud of Debris.
2. Debris Falling from the Sky.
3. Loud Rushing Sound.
4. Dark Skies with a Green Hue.
5. Complete Calm Following a Thunderstorm.
6. Sudden Large Heavy Hail.
7. Rotating Funnel Cloud Reaching Down from the Sky.
8. Wall Clouds.

Do tornadoes start from the bottom?
-----------------------------------

Tornadoes form from the ground up. New measurements from tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kansas suggest these storms’ swirling winds first develop near the ground. That’s contrary to the long-accepted theory that tornado winds are born several kilometers up in clouds and only later touch down on Earth’s surface.

What conditions create a tornado?
---------------------------------

Tornadoes form when warm, humid air collides with cold, dry air. The denser cold air is pushed over the warm air, usually producing thunderstorms. The warm air rises through the colder air, causing an updraft.

How do tornadoes develop from thunderstorms?
--------------------------------------------

Weather – Tornadoes A large thunderstorm occurs in a cumulonimbus cloud A change in wind direction and wind speed at high altitudes causes the air to swirl horizontally Rising air from the ground pushes up on the swirling air and tips it over The funnel of swirling air begins to suck up more warm air from the ground The funnel grows longer and stretches toward the ground

How do tornadoes form step by step?
-----------------------------------

The typical steps for the formation of a tornado are as follows: A large thunderstorm occurs in a cumulonimbus cloud. A change in wind direction and wind speed at high altitudes causes the air to swirl horizontally. Rising air from the ground pushes up on the swirling air and tips it over.

How fast is the wind rotation in a tornado?
-------------------------------------------

Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (180 km/h), are about 250 feet (80 m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating.
