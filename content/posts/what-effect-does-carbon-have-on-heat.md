What effect does carbon have on heat?
-------------------------------------

The temperature of the Earth depends on a balance between incoming energy from the Sun and the energy that bounces back into space. Carbon dioxide absorbs heat that would otherwise be lost to space. Some of this energy is re-emitted back to Earth, causing additional heating of the planet.

How does carbon make the Earth warmer?
--------------------------------------

Carbon dioxide acts like a heat-trapping blanket, warming our planet. The greenhouse effect keeps Earth warm. The higher the levels of these energy trapping molecules, the warmer our planet gets. Over the last 800,000 years, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has cycled between 180 and 280 ppm.

Does carbon make the earth hotter?
----------------------------------

Rising carbon dioxide concentrations are already causing the planet to heat up. At the same time that greenhouse gases have been increasing, average global temperatures have risen 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1880.

How many tons of carbon does a pellet stove produce?
----------------------------------------------------

However, if you heat with electric heat, it is closer to 85 tons. Per dollar invested, wood or pellet stoves and boilers can reduce more carbon emissions than any other heating energy source. In a significant portion of the middle of this country, a wood or pellet stove can supply 80 – 100 percent of necessary heat for small and mid-sized homes.

How to calculate the carbon content of heat?
--------------------------------------------

The rest of the carbon output is atributed to heat. As an example – at a time when the grid carbon factor is 300 gCO2/kWh we would therefore arrive at a carbon content of the heat as follows: 353.8 – (0.442 x 300) = 221.2 gCO2 for each 1 kWh of heat supplied.

Why do wood stoves release so much carbon?
------------------------------------------

For a wood stove, you are probably releasing carbon that was sequestered when Bill Clinton was in office. If you are burning natural gas you are releasing carbon that was sequestered when there were dinosaurs roaming around. I like… My book, my movies, my videos, my podcasts, my events the big collection of paul wheaton stuff!

How much CO2 is produced by heat and electricity?
-------------------------------------------------

Findings from the study reveal the “on the road” efficiency of the Micro CHP technology tested is 52% for heat and 22% for electricity. That means – in the context of our comparison – to deliver 1kWh of heat into a treated space you would need to use 1.92 kWh of gas. The combustion of 1.92 kWh of gas therefore produces 353.8g of CO2.
