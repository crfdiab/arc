Which is the longest cyclone in the world?
------------------------------------------

Typhoon Tip  
Records and meteorological statistics Typhoon Tip was the largest tropical cyclone on record, with a diameter of 1,380 mi (2,220 km)—almost double the previous record of 700 mi (1,130 km) set by Typhoon Marge in August 1951.

How long is one cycle of a cyclone?
-----------------------------------

An average life cycle of a cyclone is nine days and includes four stages: formative, immature, mature and decay. The formative stage is the first and develops from an area of strong convective cloud. Stage two (the immature stage) sees the beginning of gale force winds and the official naming of the cyclone.

How long do wave Cyclones last?
-------------------------------

Skies are cloudy, and precipitation is steady and substantial to the northeast. A midlatitude cyclone’s life cycle typically last three days. However, when conditions are favorable, the cyclone can progress from its birth to maximum intensity in 24 hr or less.

How long does the life cycle of a tropical cyclone last?
--------------------------------------------------------

The life cycle of a tropical cyclone can last from a few days to as long as three weeks. This depends on the heat energy gathered from its source—the ocean. Tropical cyclones are known by various names – such as hurricanes and typhoons – in different parts of the world.

How long does it take for a cyclone to pass over?
-------------------------------------------------

You are likely in the eye of the storm, which can take hours to pass over — wait for the all clear before leaving for safety. The problem with this category system is that it only considers the speed of the winds — not the other impacts of the storm so it can misrepresent the whole impact.

How often do tropical cyclones occur in Australia?
--------------------------------------------------

Cyclones are part and parcel of an Australian summer. In a normal year, about 11 tropical cyclones develop in Australian waters and four make landfall. But what makes a cyclone and what are their impacts? Tropical cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons are all names for the same phenomena.

Is there such a thing as a tropical like Cyclone?
-------------------------------------------------

The term tropical-like was in no way meant to indicate a hybrid cyclone exhibiting characteristics not usually seen in “true” tropical cyclones. In their matured stages, Mediterranean tropical cyclones show no difference to other tropical cyclones. And only tropical cyclones are known to develop into hurricanes.
