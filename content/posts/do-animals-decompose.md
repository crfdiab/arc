Do animals decompose?
---------------------

Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death. Animals, such as worms, also help decompose the organic materials. Organisms that do this are known as decomposers. Although no two organisms decompose in the same way, they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition.

How long does it take a fallen tree to decompose?
-------------------------------------------------

The computer model calculates that the “residence times” (how long a tree will take to completely decompose) for conifer species range from 57 to 124 years, while hardwood species are typically around on the forest floor for 46 to 71 years.

Can velvet worms be pets?
-------------------------

These are Epiperipatus barbadensis, the Barbados Brown Velvet Worm. Unlike the ones from New Zealand that have made it into the US hobby off and on the past couple decades on a limited basis, these ones are happy at room temperature and don’t require extreme measures like keeping them in wine coolers.

What are the decomposers in tropical rainforest biomes?
-------------------------------------------------------

Decomposers are important in nature because they recycle waste into useful nutrients that are necessary for the soil. Tropical rainforest biomes exist in different parts of the world, such as Australia, South America and Africa. These rain forests are also endangered.

How does decomposition take place on the forest floor?
------------------------------------------------------

On the forest floor it is spread out both spatially and in time. When people make compost heaps in their garden, they are utilising the same process, which is concentrated and accelerated by piling the dead material together in a compost heap, where the heat that is generated speeds up the process of decay.

Who are the consumers of the rain forest?
-----------------------------------------

consumers: A consumer is an animal that eats plants and animals for food. some rainforest consumers are, African elephant, Alpaca anteater, Amazon butterflies, Amazon sting ray, Anaconda, aye-Aye monkey, Bald eagle, Bengal tiger, A decomposer is an organism that breaks down other dead. organisms into nutrients.

Which is the species that carries out the process of decomposition?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The species that carry out the process of decomposition are known as detritivores. Detritivore means literally ‘feeders on dead or decaying organic matter’. Many of these decomposer species function in tandem or parallel with one another.
