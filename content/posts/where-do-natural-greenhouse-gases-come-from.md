Where do natural greenhouse gases come from?
--------------------------------------------

In the United States, most of the emissions of human-caused (anthropogenic) greenhouse gases (GHG) come primarily from burning fossil fuels—coal, natural gas, and petroleum—for energy use.

Where is ozone greenhouse gas from?
-----------------------------------

Ozone occurs naturally at higher elevations in the atmosphere (the stratosphere) where it forms a layer that blocks ultraviolet (UV) light, which is harmful to plant and animal life, from reaching the earth’s surface.

What are the major greenhouse gases and where do they come from include both natural and manmade sources?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and nitrous oxide, while others are synthetic. Those that are man-made include the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), as well as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).

Where do carbon gases come from?
--------------------------------

Natural sources of carbon dioxide include most animals, which exhale carbon dioxide as a waste product. Human activities that lead to carbon dioxide emissions come primarily from energy production, including burning coal, oil, or natural gas.

How does ozone act as a greenhouse gas?
---------------------------------------

At top of stratosphere, 30 miles high, ozone absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. At the top of the troposphere, 12 miles high, ozone acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping heat. In the middle of the tropsohere, ozone helps clean up certain pollutants.

Which anthropogenic greenhouse gas is most important and why?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Major greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and various synthetic chemicals. Carbon dioxide is widely reported as the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas because it currently accounts for the greatest portion of the warming associated with human activities.

What kind of gases are in the atmosphere?
-----------------------------------------

Greenhouse Gases in Our Atmosphere. Water Vapor (H2O) Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Methane (CH4) Nitrous Oxide (N2O) Ozone (O3)

What causes methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide?
------------------------------------------------------

Some of the most common — and worrisome — greenhouse gases are: Carbon dioxide, which is emitted whenever coal, oil, natural gas and other carbon-rich fossil fuels are burned. Methane is caused by the decomposition of plant matter, and is released from landfills, swamps, rice paddies. Nitrous oxide is released from bacteria in soil.

Where does ozone and nitrous oxide come from?
---------------------------------------------

Nitrous oxide is released into the atmosphere after being produced by microbial processes in water and soil. The gas is also released during industrial operations such as the burning of fossil fuels and vehicle emissions. Ozone is located in the stratosphere above Earth and is composed of oxygen and ultraviolet radiation.

How is methane naturally introduced into the atmosphere?
--------------------------------------------------------

Methane is naturally introduced into the atmosphere through the decay of organic material. As a result of human activity such as the burning of coal and oil, unbalanced and excessive amounts of methane are introduced into the atmosphere.
