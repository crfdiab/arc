What maintains the water cycle?
-------------------------------

The ocean plays a key role in this vital cycle of water. The ocean holds 97% of the total water on the planet; 78% of global precipitation occurs over the ocean, and it is the source of 86% of global evaporation.

How do we balance the water cycle?
----------------------------------

Just as one balances the household budget with income, savings and expenditures, the hydrological budget is a balance of gains and losses: precipitation minus evaporation minus changes in storage (snow, glaciers, lakes, groundwater) = discharge.

How does the process of the water cycle work?
---------------------------------------------

How does the water cycle work? Water molecules are heated by the sun and turn into water vapor that rises into the air through a process called evaporation. Next, the water vapor cools and forms clouds, through condensation. Over time, the clouds become heavy because those cooled water particles have turned into water droplets.

How is the water cycle important to all life on Earth?
------------------------------------------------------

All movement and every path that water follows on a local and global scale, are part of what is known as The Water Cycle. This article will focus on explaining what The Water Cycle is, how it works, and its importance for all life on Earth.

Which is the starting point of the water cycle?
-----------------------------------------------

The water cycle has no starting point. But, we’ll begin in the oceans, since that is where most of Earth’s water exists. The sun, which drives the water cycle, heats water in the oceans. Some of it evaporates as vapor into the air. Ice and snow can sublimate directly into water vapor.

How does magma contribute to the water cycle?
---------------------------------------------

Water set free by magma began to cool down the Earth’s atmosphere, until it could stay on the surface as a liquid. Volcanic activity kept and still keeps introducing water in the atmosphere, thus increasing the surface- and groundwater volume of the Earth. The water cycle has no starting point.
