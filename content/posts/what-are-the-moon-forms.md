What are the Moon forms?
------------------------

What is most widely accepted today is the giant-impact theory. It proposes that the Moon formed during a collision between the Earth and another small planet, about the size of Mars. The debris from this impact collected in an orbit around Earth to form the Moon.

What is the Moon formed by?
---------------------------

The giant-impact hypothesis, sometimes called the Big Splash, or the Theia Impact, suggests that the Moon formed from the ejecta of a collision between the proto-Earth and a Mars-sized planet, approximately 4.5 billion years ago, in the Hadean eon (about 20 to 100 million years after the Solar System coalesced).

What are the names of the 5 possible explanations for the origin of the Moon?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fission Theory. The fission theory suggests that, at one point, the Earth was spinning so fast that part of it spun off to form the moon.

7. Capture Theory.
8. Co-Accretion Theory.
9. Giant Impact Hypothesis.
What are the theories about how the Moon formed?
------------------------------------------------

Prior to the Apollo mission research there were three theories about how the Moon formed. Capture theory suggests that the Moon was a wandering body (like an asteroid) that formed elsewhere in the solar system and was captured by Earth’s gravity as it passed nearby.

How are the moons of Jupiter and the Earth created?
---------------------------------------------------

Those moons look like they formed along with Jupiter, with the whole system created together. Our own Earth’s moon, on the other hand, did not form along with the Earth.

What do you call the different phases of the Moon?
--------------------------------------------------

The different shapes of the Moon that we see at different times of the month are called the Moon’s phases. The Moon’s appearance changes throughout the month. Credit: NASA’s Scientific Visualization Studio

What are the names of the moons that NASA has explored?
-------------------------------------------------------

NASA’s Mars Odyssey spacecraft has captured these six infrared views of the Martian moon Phobos. Infrared images from NASA’s Juno spacecraft are providing the first glimpse of Ganymede’s icy north pole. NASA’s next giant leap may be aided by tiny lunar robots that would help scout the lunar surface.
