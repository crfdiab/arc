What tools do meteorologists use to measure tornadoes?
------------------------------------------------------

The EF Scale is the standard way to measure tornadoes based on wind damage. The original Fujita Scale (or F Scale) was developed by Dr. Theodore Fujita. All tornadoes, and other severe local windstorms, were assigned a number according to the most intense damage caused by the storm.

How do meteorologists rate the strength of tornadoes?
-----------------------------------------------------

The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale allows meteorologists to estimate the strength of a tornado’s winds at a certain point. The scale ranges from EF-0, with winds as low as 65 MPH, to an EF-5, which packs winds of 200 MPH or stronger. Most tornadoes fall on the lower end of the scale.

How do meteorologists predict a tornado?
----------------------------------------

Here is a very generalized view from the perspective of a severe weather forecaster: When predicting severe weather (including tornadoes) a day or two in advance, we look for the development of temperature and wind flow patterns in the atmosphere which can cause enough moisture, instability, lift, and wind shear for …

What is used for rating the intensity of tornado?
-------------------------------------------------

The Fujita scale (F-Scale; /fuˈdʒiːtə/), or Fujita–Pearson scale (FPP scale), is a scale for rating tornado intensity, based primarily on the damage tornadoes inflict on human-built structures and vegetation. …

Which is the best way to measure tornado strength?
--------------------------------------------------

For over three decades prior to 2007, the most widely used method worldwide for estimating tornado strength and wind speed was the F-scale developed by Dr. Theodore (Ted) Fujita. Since 2007 in the U.S., the new Enhanced F-scale has become the standard for assessing tornado strength and resultant damage.

How is the EF scale used to rate tornadoes?
-------------------------------------------

Since 2007, the EF Scale has been used to rate tornadoes. The Storm Prediction Center has a brief description of the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Original Fujita Scale estimated wind speeds: less than 73 mph.

How are Tornados rated by a meteorologist?
------------------------------------------

The strength, size, and fleeting nature of tornadoes require meteorologists to rate a tornado by surveying damage left behind by the storm. Some of these tornado ratings can be surprising and even controversial.

How are storm spotters trained to detect tornadoes?
---------------------------------------------------

Some of these are visual cues, like the rear-flank downdraft, and others are particular patterns in radar images, like the tornadic vortex signature (TVS). Storm spotters have been trained to recognize tornado conditions and report what they see to the National Weather Service.
