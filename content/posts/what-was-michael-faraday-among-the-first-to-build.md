What was Michael Faraday among the first to build?
--------------------------------------------------

Faraday had created the first transformer in August 1831. A few months later he designed and made this simple piece of apparatus based on his ring, developing the first ever electric generator.

What is Michael Faraday most famous for?
----------------------------------------

Best known for his work on electricity and electrochemistry, Faraday proposed the laws of electrolysis. He also discovered benzene and other hydrocarbons. As a young man in London, Michael Faraday attended science lectures by the great Sir Humphry Davy.

What did Michael Faraday discover?
----------------------------------

Michael Faraday (22 September 1791 – 25 August 1867) is probably best known for his discovery of electromagnetic induction, his contributions to electrical engineering and electrochemistry or due to the fact that he was responsible for introducing the concept of field in physics to describe electromagnetic interaction.

What did Michael Faraday discover in the 19th century?
------------------------------------------------------

discoveries/inventions: Electromagnetic Induction, Plane Of Polarization, Benzene. Michael Faraday was one of the most prolific scientists of the 19th century. A British physicist and chemist, Faraday is best known for his discoveries of electromagnetic induction and the laws of electrolysis.

When did Michael Faraday propose the law of induction?
------------------------------------------------------

This phenomenon is known as electromagnetic induction. Michael Faraday proposed the laws of electromagnetic induction in the year 1831. Faraday’s law or the law of electromagnetic induction is the observation or results of the experiments conducted by Faraday.

When did Michael Faraday invent the first electric motor?
---------------------------------------------------------

In 1820 Michael Faraday produced the first known compounds of carbon and chlorine. In 1825 he isolated and described benzene. What’s more, in 1821 he invented the first electric motor, and in the early 1830s he discovered a way to convert mechanical energy into electricity on a large scale, creating the first electric generator.

Who was the architect of the Michael Faraday Memorial?
------------------------------------------------------

Designed by brutalist architect Rodney Gordon, the memorial commemorates Michael Faraday’s importance as a scientist. Walworth, London not only has a small park by the name Faraday Gardens, but also a school which is known as Michael Faraday Primary school.
