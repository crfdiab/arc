Is the Namib Desert the oldest desert in the world?
---------------------------------------------------

Geologists believe that the Namib Desert is the world’s oldest desert. It is thought that an arid climate began to dominate in the region approximately 55 million years old, before changing to a semi-arid climate 14-18 million years ago. The Namib experiences less than 1cm of rain annually and is almost entirely barren.
