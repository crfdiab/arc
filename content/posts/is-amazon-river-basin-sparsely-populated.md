Is Amazon River basin sparsely populated?
-----------------------------------------

Amazonia is sparsely populated. There are scattered settlements inland, but most of the population lives in a few larger cities on the banks of the Amazon and other major rivers, such as in Iquitos – Loreto in Peru, Manaus-Amazonas State, and Belém, Pará.

Why does the Amazon basin have hot and wet climate throughout the year?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Amazon basin lies in the equatorial region, owing to which it has a hot and wet climate throughout the year. The high temperature and heavy rainfall give rise to dense and luxuriant vegetation in the Amazon basin. The evergreen tropical rainforests of this area are the largest of their kind and are known as selvas.

What environmental problem affects the Amazon River basin?
----------------------------------------------------------

Yet despite its vastness and importance, the Amazon faces a deluge of threats: a dam-building spree across the basin is disrupting fish migration and nutrient cycling, large-scale deforestation is destroying habitats and increasing sedimentation, pollution from mining and agribusiness is affecting aquatic ecosystems.

Why does the Amazon rainforest have a low population density?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Our research hypothesis is that there is a low overall relation in the Amazon for population and deforestation because local conditions vary widely. For example, strong deforestation rates may be observed in areas of low population densities because of expansion of large-scale agriculture and cattle ranching.

Why is Amazon basin populated?
------------------------------

Many of these populations existed along whitewater rivers where they had good means of transportation, excellent fishing, and fertile floodplain soils for agriculture. However, when Europeans arrived, these were the first settlements to be affected, since Europeans used the major rivers as highways to the interior.

Where can you find ancient soil in the Amazon River basin?
----------------------------------------------------------

While this ancient soil can be found in several countries in the Amazon River Basin it’s primarily found in Brazil. This isn’t surprising as Brazil is the largest country in South America.

Why did scientists study the Amazon River basin?
------------------------------------------------

To see how widespread human settlements were in the Amazon, scientists focused on the basin of the upper reaches of the Tapajós River, a major tributary of the Amazon. They concentrated on this area because of the dearth of archaeological research in this previously uncharted region.
