How do you determine biotic and abiotic factors?
------------------------------------------------

Examples of abiotic factors are water, air, soil, sunlight, and minerals. Biotic factors are living or once-living organisms in the ecosystem. These are obtained from the biosphere and are capable of reproduction. Examples of biotic factors are animals, birds, plants, fungi, and other similar organisms.

What are the biotic and abiotic factors you might find in the ocean?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Biotic factors include plants, animals, fungi, algae, and bacteria. Abiotic factors include sunlight, temperature, moisture, wind or water currents, soil type, and nutrient availability. Ocean ecosystems are impacted by abiotic factors in ways that may be different from terrestrial ecosystems.

How do you identify abiotic factors?
------------------------------------

An abiotic factor is a non-living part of an ecosystem that shapes its environment. In a terrestrial ecosystem, examples might include temperature, light, and water. In a marine ecosystem, abiotic factors would include salinity and ocean currents. Abiotic and biotic factors work together to create a unique ecosystem.

What consists of all of the abiotic and biotic factors in an area?
------------------------------------------------------------------

An ecosystem consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area and their interactions. A niche refers to the role of a species in its ecosystem.

Is gold abiotic or biotic?
--------------------------

The term abiotic means non-living, or never having lived. Examples of abiotic factors would include gold, rock, bicycle, brick, and cement.

What are some characteristics of biotic and abiotic factors?
------------------------------------------------------------

Abiotic factors are the nonliving physical and chemical components of an ecosystem, while biotic factors are the living components of an ecosystem. Both types of factors affect reproduction and survival.Abiotic factors include moisture, sunlight, soil chemistry, temperature, water chemistry and precipitation.

Which is an example of an abioptic and biotic interaction?
----------------------------------------------------------

Examples of interactions between Abioptic and Biotic Factors: -Soil is abiotic but it is necessary for most living organisms to survive. The soil holds support and water for the plant growing inside it. When it rains the soil soaks up all the rain that falls and the roots of the plants soak up the water to keep the plant hydrated and alive.

Where do abiotic components originate in the hydrosphere?
---------------------------------------------------------

Abiotic components originate from the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere Discover more about Abiotic and Biotic factors, their meaning, the difference between abiotic and biotic resources and other related topics only at BYJUâ€™S Biology

How does bitotic factor interact with abiotic factor?
-----------------------------------------------------

The images shows an interaction with a bitotic factor with an abiotic factor. The amphibian lives within the pond which is abiotic.
