Where does fog come from?
-------------------------

Fog develops when water vapor — the gas form of water — condenses. As it condenses, the water vapor molecules combine, which in turn form water droplets that hang in the air, according to National Geographic. The droplets are what make fog visible, because water vapor, like all gases, is invisible.

How fog is formed during winter?
--------------------------------

The cold balls of ice fall into warm, very moist air near the surface. As the hail accumulates on the ground, it cools the air just above the ground to the dew point, resulting in fog. The fog forms when winds are light, and it usually quite patchy and shallow.

Why does fog form in the morning?
---------------------------------

Fog is most likely to form the morning after it has rained. This keeps the soil saturated and the water will evaporate throughout the night. This makes the dew-point depression, or the difference between the temperature and dew point, much smaller. Throughout the day, the dew-point depression is higher.

What is morning fog?
--------------------

There are several reasons why fog typically develops early in the morning. Fog is made up of many very tiny water droplets or ice crystals. The lowest temperatures occur early in the morning, usually between 5 and 7 am. This means that the temperature will drop closest to the dew point temperature during this time.

How does steam fog form in the air?
-----------------------------------

Steam fog forms when cold air moves over warm water. When the cool air mixes with the warm moist air over the water, the moist air cools until its humidity reaches 100% and fog forms. This type of fog takes on the appearance of wisps of smoke rising off the surface of the water. The other type of evaporation fog is known as frontal fog.

What causes fog to form in the water?
-------------------------------------

When the cool air mixes with the warm moist air over the water, the moist air cools until its humidity reaches 100% and fog forms. This type of fog takes on the appearance of wisps of smoke rising off the surface of the water.

What are two types of fog that form?
------------------------------------

The two common types are steam fog and frontal fog. Steam fog forms when cold air moves over warm water. When the cool air mixes with the warm moist air over the water, the moist air cools until its humidity reaches 100% and fog forms.

Where does the advection fog in the atmosphere come from?
---------------------------------------------------------

In the atmosphere, the fluid is wind. When the moist, warm air makes contact with the cooler surface air, water vapor condenses to create fog. Advection fog shows up mostly in places where warm, tropical air meets cooler ocean water.
