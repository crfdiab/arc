How are Florida electoral votes determined?
-------------------------------------------

Electoral votes are allocated among the States based on the Census. Every State is allocated a number of votes equal to the number of senators and representatives in its U.S. Congressional delegation—two votes for its senators in the U.S. Senate plus a number of votes equal to the number of its Congressional districts.

Which states do not use the winner-take-all system?
---------------------------------------------------

Only two states, Nebraska and Maine, do not follow this winner-take-all method. In those states, electoral votes are proportionally allocated.

How are the number of Delegates in each state determined?
---------------------------------------------------------

The number of delegates in each state depends on that state’s population, similar to how the number of electoral votes depends on that state’s population. Given this, California has the highest number of delegates, with 494 for the Democratic convention and 172 for the Republican convention.

Wyoming and North Dakota have the fewest number of delegates, with 18 Democratic and 29 Republican each.

How are the delegates chosen in the primaries?
----------------------------------------------

Delegates are either won by proportion, where the candidate receives a proportionate number of delegates to the number of votes in the state’s primary, or by a winner-takes-all method, where the candidate with the majority of votes in a state wins all of that state’s delegates.
