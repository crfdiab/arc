Is volcanoes part of physical geology?
--------------------------------------

Physical Geology is a comprehensive introductory text on the physical aspects of geology, including rocks and minerals, plate tectonics, earthquakes, volcanoes, glaciation, groundwater, streams, coasts, mass wasting, climate change, planetary geology and much more.

Is a volcano physical or chemical?
----------------------------------

A real volcano eruption is a physical reaction. A physical reaction is a change in the physical properties, rather than the chemical composition, of a substance.

How do volcanoes form geography?
--------------------------------

Volcanoes form when magma , which is molten rock from beneath the Earth’s crust, reaches the surface. The magma erupts to form lava . Constructive margin – this is where two plates move away from one another. As the oceanic crust sinks into the mantle it creates magma, which rises to form a volcano.

Is physical geology hard?
-------------------------

Students interested in geology can prepare by taking basic courses in math, science and geography. Geology is not any more difficult or easy to learn than any other academic subject. It is however a science and requires time and dedication if you want to achieve success in the subject.

How are the different types of volcanoes related?
-------------------------------------------------

Types of Volcanoes. A volcano is a vent through which molten rock and gas escape from a magma chamber and they can differ in height, shape, and slope steepness. Some volcanoes are tall cones and others are just cracks in the ground. As you might expect, the shape of a volcano is related to the composition of its magma.

How are volcanoes a feature of the Earth’s crust?
-------------------------------------------------

Plate Tectonics and Volcanic Activity A volcano is a feature in Earth’s crust where molten rock is squeezed out onto the Earth’s surface. Along with molten rock, volcanoes also release gases, ash, and solid rock.

Where can I learn more about volcanoes in geography?
----------------------------------------------------

These educational resources are hand-picked from BBC Bitesize and the wider BBC. Here you will find videos and activities about volcanoes. Try them out, and then test your knowledge with a short quiz before exploring the rest of the collection. Learn about volcanoes with Sue Venir from BBC Bitesize – KS2 – Geography.

What’s the difference between magma and lava in a volcano?
----------------------------------------------------------

8\. Magma and lava are two different things! Magma is the name given to hot liquid rock inside a volcano. Once it leaves the volcano, it’s known as lava. Psst! Make sure you download our awesome volcano facts infographic – show your friends, family, or stick it on your wall! 9. Volcanoes don’t just occur on land.
