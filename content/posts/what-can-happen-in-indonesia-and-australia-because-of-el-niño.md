What can happen in Indonesia and Australia because of El Niño?
--------------------------------------------------------------

In the equatorial Pacific, as the warm pool propagates eastward, clouds and rainfall move with it and leave the Western Pacific in dry conditions that often lead to drought across Indonesia, southeast Asia, and northern Australia. But when the rain dries up during a strong El Niño, those fires burn uncontrolled.

What happens in Indonesia during El Niño?
-----------------------------------------

Many studies have revealed a strong correlation between El Niño and rainfall variability which further leads to retreat of the rainfall onset in Indonesia. A significant shift of the rainy season is found as El Niño signs strengthen, causing a prolonged dry season.

What happens to Australia during El Niño?
-----------------------------------------

El Niño years tend to see warmer-than-average temperatures across most of southern Australia, particularly during the second half of the year. In general, decreased cloud cover results in warmer-than-average daytime temperatures, particularly in the spring and summer months.

Which of the following occur during an El Niño?
-----------------------------------------------

During an El Niño, the trade winds weaken in the central and western Pacific. Surface water temperatures off South America warm up, because there is less upwelling of the cold water from below to cool the surface. The clouds and rainstorms associated with warm ocean waters also shift toward the east.

What countries does El Niño effect?
-----------------------------------

El Niño has been linked with drought not just in parts of Latin America but in southeastern Africa, South Asia, Indonesia and Australia. It has also been associated with steep declines in fish stocks, including the 1972 collapse of the world’s largest fishery, the Peruvian anchoveta.

What is the effect of El Niño?
------------------------------

El Niño conditions can cause a wide range of health problems, including disease outbreaks, malnutrition, heat stress, and respiratory diseases. The risk of communicable diseases increases when there is limited access to food, water, and sanitation.

How does El Niño and La Nina affect Indonesia?
----------------------------------------------

Rainfall increases over Indonesia (where waters remain warm) and decreases over the central tropical Pacific (which is cool). Over Indonesia, there is more rising air motion and lower surface pressure. There is more sinking air motion over the cooler waters of the central and eastern Pacific.

What is the meaning of El Niño?
-------------------------------

El Niño is a climate pattern that describes the unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. El Nino is the “warm phase” of a larger phenomenon called the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

Is 2020 an El Niño year?
------------------------

The 2020-2021 La Niña event has concluded, according to both oceanic and atmospheric indicators. In 2021, the sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern-central Pacific weakened, leading to the currently prevailing weak cool anomalies that are not cold enough to meet the La Niña threshold.

What is El Niño effect?
-----------------------

El Nino is a climate pattern that describes the unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. El Niño has an impact on ocean temperatures, the speed and strength of ocean currents, the health of coastal fisheries, and local weather from Australia to South America and beyond.

What are the effects of El Nino on Indonesia?
---------------------------------------------

One of the most predictable consequences of a strong El Niño is a change in rainfall patterns over Indonesia. During El Niño years, rain that is normally centered over Indonesia and the far western Pacific shifts eastward into the central Pacific; as a result, parts of Indonesia experience drought.

How many El Nino events have there been in Australia?
-----------------------------------------------------

Australian winter spring mean rainfall deciles averaged for twelve strong El Niño events. Although most major Australian droughts have been associated with El Niño, analysis of past El Niño events shows that widespread drought does not occur with every event, and the strength of an El Niño is not directly proportional to the rainfall impacts.

How does El Nino affect tropical cyclones in Australia?
-------------------------------------------------------

On average, there are fewer tropical cyclones in the Australian region during El Niño years. This is particularly true around Queensland, where cyclones are half as likely to cross the coast during El Niño years compared to neutral years.

Where does El Nino usually occur in the Pacific?
------------------------------------------------

As a result, the heavy rainfall that usually occurs to the north of Australia moves to the central and eastern parts of the Pacific basin. The term El Niño describes a particular phase of the ENSO climate cycle.
