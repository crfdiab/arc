How many types of surface waves are there?
------------------------------------------

two types  
There are two types of surface waves, Rayleigh waves and Love waves.

What is the fastest surface wave?
---------------------------------

Love wave  
The first kind of surface wave is called a Love wave, named after A.E.H. Love, a British mathematician who worked out the mathematical model for this kind of wave in 1911. Itâ€™s the fastest surface wave and moves the ground from side-to-side.

What is a real life example of a surface wave?
----------------------------------------------

In physics, a surface wave is a mechanical wave that propagates along the interface between differing media. A common example is gravity waves along the surface of liquids, such as ocean waves. Gravity waves can also occur within liquids, at the interface between two fluids with different densities.

Which is an example of a surface wave?
--------------------------------------

Surface waves are mechanical waves that travel along the surface or interface between two media. An example of a surface wave would be waves in a pool, or in an ocean, lake, or any other type of water body.

Why are there so many waves in the ocean?
-----------------------------------------

Wind-driven waves, or surface waves, are created by the friction between wind and surface water. As wind blows across the surface of the ocean or a lake, the continual disturbance creates a wave crest. These types of waves are found globally across the open ocean and along the coast.

What are the types of waves in physics?
---------------------------------------

Types of Waves in Physics. 1 Mechanical Wave. A mechanical wave is a wave that is an oscillation of matter and is responsible for the transfer of energy through a medium. 2 Electromagnetic Wave. 3 Difference Between Mechanical Wave and Non-Mechanical Wave. 4 Matter Wave.

Which is an example of a mechanical wave?
-----------------------------------------

In the case of electromagnetic waves, no medium is required for the energy to travel across. As mentioned earlier, common examples of mechanical waves are water waves, sound waves and seismic waves. There are three types of mechanical waves: transverse waves, longitudinal waves, and surface waves.
