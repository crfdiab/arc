What did JJ Thomson win the Nobel Prize for in 1906?
----------------------------------------------------

Nobel Prize in Physics 1906  
The Nobel Prize in Physics 1906 was awarded to Joseph John Thomson “in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases.”

What did JJ Thomson discover in 1906?
-------------------------------------

This discovery upended the prevailing theory that the atom was the smallest fundamental unit. In 1906, Thomson began studying positively charged ions, or positive rays. In doing so, he discovered that neon was composed of two different kinds of atoms, and proved the existence of isotopes in a stable element.

What particle did JJ Thomson discover?
--------------------------------------

the electron  
In 1897 Thomson discovered the electron and then went on to propose a model for the structure of the atom. His work also led to the invention of the mass spectrograph. The British physicist Joseph John (J. J.)

What particle did JJ Thomson discover and what was its charge?
--------------------------------------------------------------

J.J. Thomson’s experiments with cathode ray tubes showed that all atoms contain tiny negatively charged subatomic particles or electrons. Thomson’s plum pudding model of the atom had negatively-charged electrons embedded within a positively-charged “soup.”

Did JJ Thomson work with other scientists?
------------------------------------------

Gardening was his hobby. J. J. Thomson died at age 83, on August 30, 1940. His ashes were buried in the Nave of Westminster Abbey, joining other science greats such as Isaac Newton, Lord Kelvin, Charles Darwin, Charles Lyell, and his friend and former research worker Ernest Rutherford.

Who is the father of Proton?
----------------------------

Ernest Rutherford  
The proton was discovered by Ernest Rutherford in the early 1900’s. During this period, his research resulted in a nuclear reaction which led to the first ‘splitting’ of the atom, where he discovered protons. He named his discovery “protons” based on the Greek word “protos” which means first.

What made JJ Thomson interested in science?
-------------------------------------------

By Thomson’s time, scientists were convinced that atoms were the smallest particles in the universe, the fundamental building blocks of everything. These beliefs were shattered by J. J. Thomson’s experiments, which proved the existence of a new fundamental particle, much smaller than the atom: the electron.

Where did j.j.thomson do his research?
--------------------------------------

Who Was J.J. Thomson? J.J. Thomson attended Trinity College at Cambridge, where he would come to head the Cavendish Laboratory. His research in cathode rays led to the discovery of the electron, and he pursued further innovations in atomic structure exploration. Thomson won the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics, among many accolades.

What did J J Thomson call the particles he discovered?
------------------------------------------------------

He called the particles “corpuscles”, but later scientists preferred the name electron which had been suggested by George Johnstone Stoney in 1891, prior to Thomson’s actual discovery.
