Why is it important to be aware of places prone to earthquakes Brainly?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer: It is important to be aware about this because earthquakes are incredibly powerful natural disasters that can cause us harm or loss.

Why is it important to identify the areas which are prone to volcanoes Brainly?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer: The main purpose of the monitoring is to learn when new magma is rising in the volcano that could lead to an eruption. There’s a huge hazard in the air from eruption plumes.

Why it is important to be aware of places?
------------------------------------------

An understanding of place is fundamental to the concept of livability, including transportation-related aspects of livability. People live in places, move within and between places, and depend on the movement of goods to and from places. The individual characteristics of places are vital in determining quality of life.

How do you describe the location of earthquake epicenters and volcanoes?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer: The Ring of Fire, also referred to as the Circum-Pacific Belt, is a path along the Pacific Ocean characterized by active volcanoes and frequent earthquakes. Along much of the Ring of Fire, plates overlap at convergent boundaries called subduction zones.

What is the impact of volcanic eruption to the community?
---------------------------------------------------------

Volcanoes spew hot, dangerous gases, ash, lava, and rock that are powerfully destructive. People have died from volcanic blasts. Volcanic eruptions can result in additional threats to health, such as floods, mudslides, power outages, drinking water contamination, and wildfires.

How can you stay safe in an area with volcanic activity?
--------------------------------------------------------

Protecting yourself during ashfall

- Stay inside, if possible, with windows and doors closed.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants.
- Use goggles to protect your eyes.
- Exposure to ash can harm your health, particularly the respiratory (breathing) tract.
- Keep your car or truck engine switched off. Why is it important to know the earthquake hazard areas in?
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    
    It is really important to be aware of earthquake hazard areas in your locality. There are several factors that can cost you your life because of living in an area that is more hazardous at the time of occurrence of a natural disaster. Some of these hazards includes: 1.
    
    Why is it important for us to identify areas which are?
    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    Strong Earthquake can result to lost of thousands of lives and destruction to infrastructure and it is a type of disaster which cannot be predicted. It is challenging to all the people since we cannot predict earthquake, government agencies issues an quarterly earthquake dril l as precautionary measure to prevent lost of life and casualties.
    
    Is it possible to predict when an earthquake will happen?
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    Right now, earthquake prediction is pretty hit and miss. The earth is an extremely complicated and dynamic system, so being able to say, uh-oh, there’s going to be an earthquake on Tuesday at 10:37 a.m. in this area here is well beyond us. Indeed, it may never be possible to get that precise.
    
    Why is it important to study the epicenter of an earthquake?
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Studying earthquake’s epicenter is one of the basis of the scientist in dividing the Earth’s lithosphere into several segments called plates. Majority of the earthquake occur the plate boundary. Occurs when two plates moves towards each other.
