What did Russia do with Alaska?
-------------------------------

Seward and Russian envoy Baron Edouard de Stoeckl signed the Treaty of Cession. With a stroke of a pen, Tsar Alexander II had ceded Alaska, his country’s last remaining foothold in North America, to the United States for US$7.2 million.

Did Alaska used to be connected to Russia?
------------------------------------------

Alaska was formally transferred to the United States on October 18, 1867, through a treaty ratified by the United States Senate. Russia had established a presence in North America during the first half of the 18th century, but few Russians ever settled in Alaska.

What did the Russians do with the Alaska Territory?
---------------------------------------------------

British and American trading vessels soon disputed Russia’s claims to the northwest coast of America, and the Russians retreated north to the present southern border of Alaska. Russian interests in Alaska gradually declined, and after the Crimean War in the 1850s, a nearly bankrupt Russia sought to dispose of the territory altogether.

Why did Russia want to sell Alaska to Britain?
----------------------------------------------

Throughout the 19th century Russia, the possessor of Alaska, and Britain had been locked in a power struggle known as “the great game,” a proto-cold war which exploded into life once in the 1850s in the Crimean War. Fearful that losing Alaska to Britain in war would be a national humiliation, the Russians were eager to sell it to another power.

Why was Russia interested in Alaska and California?
---------------------------------------------------

The lust for new lands that brought Russia to Alaska and eventually California began in the 16th century, when the country was a fraction of its current size. That began to change in 1581, when Russia overran a Siberian territory known as the Khanate of Sibir, which was controlled by a grandson of Genghis Khan.

When did the Russia and Alaska Saga start?
------------------------------------------

According to Smithsonian, the Russia/Alaska saga began in 1581, when Russia annexed a Siberian territory from one of Genghis Khan’s grandsons and then marched across the land, hunting fur and converting the “heathens” to Russian Orthodox Christianity.
