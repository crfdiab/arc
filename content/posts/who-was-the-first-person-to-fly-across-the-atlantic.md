Who was the first person to fly across the Atlantic?
----------------------------------------------------

Despite their graceless landing in a bog on June 15, 1919, Alcock and Brown were the first people ever to fly nonstop across the Atlantic Ocean. Nearly a decade before Charles Lindbergh caught the…

The U.S. Navy achieved the first transatlantic flight eight years before Charles Lindbergh became world famous for crossing the Atlantic nonstop and alone. Three Curtiss flying boats, each with a crew of six, were involved: NC-1, NC-3, and NC-4. The Navy wanted to prove the capability of the airplane as a transoceanic weapon and technology.

Who was the first person to cross the Pacific Ocean?

The first Pacific Ocean crossings were undoubtedly accomplished by Austronesian peoples, who, over a period of at least 5000 years, have spread out from Taiwan or the Malaysian area throughout the islands of the Pacific Ocean and even westward toward Madagascar.

When did the first Pan American flight cross the Atlantic?
----------------------------------------------------------

June 28th, 1939 was a big day, not just for Pan American, but for commercial aviation. After years of on-again, off-again negotiations, public prognostication, and the long-promised prospect of a new epoch for global travel, the first flight with paying passengers took off to cross the Atlantic.

Why was the first flight across the Atlantic a disaster?
--------------------------------------------------------

On June 14, 1919, while the Handley Page team languished as its leaders conducted flight tests, Alcock and Brown started their flight attempt. It was a disaster. The takeoff was bumpy and treacherous. Then the radio failed. Fog overwhelmed the pilots, making navigation—conducted by sextant—next to impossible. Soon, the plane was covered in ice.
