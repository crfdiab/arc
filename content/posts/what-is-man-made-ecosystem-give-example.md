What is man made ecosystem give example?
----------------------------------------

An ecosystem, which is created and maintained by human beings, is called artificial or man- made ecosystem. Some examples of man- made ecosystem are aquarium, garden, agriculture, apiary, poultry, piggery etc.

What is the characteristic of man made ecosystem?
-------------------------------------------------

Artificial ecosystems depend on natural cosmic laws. Man is only a discoverer but not a maker of natural laws. Here artificial ecosystems are not contradictions and negations of natural systems. It is only the proportions and speeds of the ecological interactions that can be meddled with, for manâ€™s advantage.

What is the characteristics of man-made ecosystem?
--------------------------------------------------

They are made by man and are artificial and without any self regulatory mechanism. The circulation of nutrients is negligible and its stability depends upon the diversity. The croplands are monoculture and lack diversity. There is a usage of technology to increase the quality of crops.

Which one is the feature of man-made ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------------

Some of the major important characteristics of artificial ecosystem are as follows: 1. Diversity will be lesser compared to natural systems. Unfavourable and less favoured species are likely to taper off slowly.

What is the role of man in an ecosystem?
----------------------------------------

Humans are an integral part of ecosystems. Ecosystems provide a variety of benefits to people, including provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Provisioning services are the products people ob- tain from ecosystems, such as food, fuel, fiber, fresh water, and genetic resources.

Which is an example of a manmade ecosystem?
-------------------------------------------

Forests and deserts are examples of terrestrial ecosystems while rivers and streams are aquatic ecosystems. Gardens, zoos and parks are terrestrial artificial ecosystems while dams, artificial lakes and aquaria are examples of manmade ecosystems. The conditions of manmade ecosystems are regularly maintained through human supervision.

Why is agriculture field a man made ecosystem?
----------------------------------------------

Because usually man is interested in only a few economically beneficial species only and only those species will be used by man to create an ecosystem e.g., agriculture field is a man made artificial ecosystem having only those plants which are economically beneficial. Thus, the correct answer is option A. Was this answer helpful?

How did human beings create an artificial ecosystem?
----------------------------------------------------

As the human beings discovered fire they also used to domesticate animals and invented an artificial ecosystem for them. The areas where they raised crops are known as the agro ecosystem. This system was temporary in nature and was formed by cutting down the forests. The land was cultivated for some years and was then left out.

Why are man made ecosystems have low stability?
-----------------------------------------------

Man made or artificial ecosystems have low stability. Because usually man is interested in only a few economically beneficial species only and only those species will be used by man to create an ecosystem e.g., agriculture field is a man made artificial ecosystem having only those plants which are economically beneficial.
