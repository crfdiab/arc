How does passive transport differ from active transport?
--------------------------------------------------------

The key difference between active and passive transport is that active transport forces molecules against the concentration gradient with help of ATP energy whereas passive transport let the molecules to pass across the membrane through a concentration channel, requiring no cellular energy.

Does passive transport not require ATP?
---------------------------------------

Some materials are so important to a cell that it spends some of its energy (hydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) to obtain these materials. Passive transport is a naturally-occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement.

Does passive transport require force?
-------------------------------------

Passive transport is a type of membrane transport that does not require energy to move substances across cell membranes. The four main kinds of passive transport are simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, filtration, and/or osmosis.

Does active or passive transport need energy?
---------------------------------------------

Active transport uses energy to transport molecules across the plasma membrane. This uses energy from ATP. They also use pumps to get molecules in or out of the cell. Passive Transport does NOT use energy to transport molecules across the membrane.

What are the 3 types of passive transport?
------------------------------------------

Three common types of passive transport include simple diffusion, osmosis, and facilitated diffusion. Simple Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.

Which is an example of passive and active transport?
----------------------------------------------------

Passive Transport Movement of molecules down a concentration gradient and plasma membrane and does not require energy input or without energy use examples: osmosis and facilitated diffusion Active Transport Requires energy, movement of molecules against concentration gradient and active transport is facillitated by proteins

What kind of energy does active transport require?
--------------------------------------------------

Active transport requires energy usually from a molecule called ATP. Passive transport require no energy. What type of energy does active transport require? a lot of energy What transport methods require energy expenditure by the cell?

How is passive transport influenced by metabolic inhibitors?
------------------------------------------------------------

Passive transportation is not influenced by metabolic inhibitors. This is the biological process in which molecules move against the concentration gradient and require chemical energy to move biochemical compounds from a lower region to the high region.

How is glucose an example of active transport?
----------------------------------------------

In active transport, the molecules move against the concentration gradient whereas in passive transport, the molecules move along the concentration gradient. Uptake of glucose in the human intestine works on the principle of active transport. Simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis and filtration are examples of passive transport.
