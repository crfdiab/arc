How do time zones work?
-----------------------

The Earth is loosely divided into 24 regions (time zones) separated by longitude. Not counting local variations, each line of longitude is divided by fifteen degrees; as a general rule and depending upon which way one travels, time moves forward or backward one hour for every fifteen degrees of longitude.

What are the advantages of time zones?
--------------------------------------

The time zone system helps in maintaining the same clock time in one particular zone. The advantage of having same time in one zone is that there is no necessity to change the time in travelling from one place to another in the same zone. All people in the same time zone can work in the scheduled timings.

What is the advantage of using GMT over local time?
---------------------------------------------------

Comparison Table Between GMT and Local Time (in Tabular Form)

<table><tr><th>Parameter of Comparison</th><th>GMT</th><th>Local Time</th></tr><tr><td>Advantages</td><td>We can easily tell the exact time in other countries with the help of GMT because it is located on the prime meridian.</td><td>Establishes the basis of time in different parts of the globe which are far away.</td></tr></table>

Why are time zones different in different parts of the world?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Time in countries to the west of the Prime Meridian is always behind that of the UK. As the Earth rotates on its axis, the Sun only shines on the side of the Earth that it is facing. This means: As it is night in some parts of the world while it is day in other parts, different places in the world have different times.

What did people do before time zones were invented?
---------------------------------------------------

Time zones have a long history. Before clocks were invented, people kept time using different instruments to observe the Sun’s meridian passing at noon. The earliest time measuring devices we know of are sundials and water clocks. The pendulum clock was developed during the 17th century.

When did time zones change in the United States?
------------------------------------------------

In 1972, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) replaced GMT as the world’s time standard. France did not formally use UTC as a reference to its standard time zone (UTC+1) until August in 1978. Standard time, in terms of time zones, was not established in United States law until the Act of March 19, 1918.

Which is the best way to set time zones?
----------------------------------------

Add it your employee onboarding to facilitate easy knowledge-sharing. Requiring all servers to have UTC set as the default time standard on every server is another alternative to prevent any guesswork on conversions. UTC is not affected by time zones so that’s a strong proponent for simplifying your work.
