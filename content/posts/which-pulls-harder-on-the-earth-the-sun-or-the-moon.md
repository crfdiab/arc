Which pulls harder on the Earth the sun or the moon?
----------------------------------------------------

The gravitational pull of the Sun on the Earth is greater than the gravitational pull of the Moon, about 180 times as large due its much greater mass, as explained in class. The tides, however, are caused by the differences in gravitational forces by the Moon on opposite sides of the Earth.

Does the moon pull just as hard on the Earth as the Earth does on the moon?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The moon pulls on the Earth with the exact same magnitude of force that the Earth pulls on the moon since it is the same interaction.

How much force does the Earth pull on the moon with?
----------------------------------------------------

The moon’s gravity pulls on Earth’s oceans, causing tides. Earth pulls on the moon, keeping it in orbit around Earth. Earth’s mass is 5.9724 x 1024 kg and the moon’s mass is 0.07346 x 1024 kg. This equates to a surface gravity on the moon of 1.62 m/s2, or 0.165 of Earth’s 9.8 m/s2 gravity.

Does the sun pull on the moon?
------------------------------

If you look at the orbit of the Moon, it orbits the Sun similar to the way Earth does. If you’re up for some napkin calculations, you little mathlete, by using Newton’s law of gravity, you find that even with its greater distance, the Sun pulls on the Moon about twice as hard as the Earth does.

Why doesn’t the sun attract the moon?
-------------------------------------

Why doesn’t the sun pull the moon away from earth? Short answer: Because the Moon is much closer to the Earth than it is to the Sun. This means the gravitational acceleration of the Earth toward the Sun is almost the same as is the gravitational acceleration of the Moon toward the Sun.

Does sun attract moon?
----------------------

Why does moon orbit Earth and not sun?
--------------------------------------

The force of the gravitational force of earth is more than the sun on moon.So the moon revolves around the earth not the sun.

Which is pulling harder, the Earth on the Moon or the Moon on the Earth?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terms in this set (5) Which pulls harder gravitationally, the Earth on the moon or the moon on the Earth? The force of attraction is the same between the Earth and the moon due to Newton’s 3rd law. The gravitational force on the moon due to the earth is only about half the force on the moon due to the sun.

Why does the Moon have less mass than the Earth?
------------------------------------------------

The moon has less mass so it has greater acceleration The gravitational force on the moon due to the earth is only about half the force on the moon due to the sun. Why isn’t the moon pulled away from the earth?

Why is the force of attraction between the Earth and the Moon the same?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The force of attraction is the same between the Earth and the moon due to Newton’s 3rd law. The moon has less mass so it has greater acceleration The moon is not pulled away from the earth because the moon and the earth are experiencing nearly the same radial acceleration due to the sun.

Why is the acceleration of Mars smaller than that of Earth?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The centripetal acceleration of Mars is smaller than that of earth. Since mars is farther from the sun (1.52 AU) the centripetal acceleration will be smaller Would it require less speed to launch a satellite a) toward the east or b) toward the west? Why? In order to orbit, a satellite must reach an orbital speed relative to the center of the earth.
