What did Emirates Stadium used to be?
-------------------------------------

Ashburton Grove  
The stadium name is colloquially shortened from “Emirates Stadium” to “The Emirates”, although some supporters continue to use the former name “Ashburton Grove” or even “The Grove”, particularly those who object to the concept of corporate sponsorship of stadium names.

Why is it called Emirates Stadium?
----------------------------------

In November 1999, Arsenal decided to leave Highbury and construct a new 60,000-seat stadium in nearby Ashburton Grove. It was confirmed in October 2004 that the new stadium would be called the Emirates Stadium as part of a sponsorship deal with Emirates Airlines.

Where to get alcohol at the Emirates Stadium?
---------------------------------------------

Along Holloway Road and again around a ten minute walk from the Emirates Stadium is the Coronet, a Wetherspoons outlet, which normally has a good mix of home and visiting supporters on matchdays. Otherwise, alcohol is available inside the stadium, although rather pricey at £5.70 a pint. What is it like for visiting supporters?
