Does it rain alot in Peru?
--------------------------

Peru is located entirely in the tropics but features desert and mountain climates as well as tropical rainforests. Elevations above sea level in the country range from −37 to 6,778 m (−121 to 22,238 ft) and precipitation ranges from less than 20 mm (0.79 in) annually to more than 8,000 mm (310 in).

Why an El Niño year brings heavy rain to the west coast of Peru?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Usually Peru observes torrential, flooding rains during El Niño when tropical Pacific ocean waters off the coast are above-average in temperature. The warm ocean temperatures helped to increase the amount of moisture in the air that could be atmospherically churned into heavy rain over land.

How does El Niño affect Peru?
-----------------------------

After a period of severe drought, per recent news reports the “El Niño” effect is bringing heavy rainfall on Peru´s Northern coast causing overflowing of rivers, mudslides and flooding. As part of the “El Niño” effect warm waters appear on the ocean surface near or during December thus causing rainfall to increase.

Why does El Niño cause more rain?
---------------------------------

During an El Niño event, the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean gets warmer than usual, particularly at the equator and along the coasts of South and Central America. Warm oceans lead to low pressure systems in the atmosphere above, which in turn leads to a lot of rain for the western coasts of the Americas.

Is La Nina good for fishing?
----------------------------

La Niña usually has a positive impact on the fishing industry of western South America. Upwelling brings cold, nutrient-rich waters to the surface. Nutrients include plankton eaten by fish and crustaceans. Higher-level predators, including high-value fish species such as sea bass, prey on the crustaceans.

Why do fishermen get less catch during El Niño?
-----------------------------------------------

An El Niño reduces the upwelling of cold water off the coast of the Americas. When this happens, fish either die or migrate into areas where they’ll find more to eat. Off California, fish populations may also be reduced.
