What is a run in a river?
-------------------------

Runs are deep with fast water and little or no turbulence. When a stream meets up with a huge fallen log, or a set of boulders, the water pours over the top. The vertical force of the water falling down on the other side will carve out a pool in the stream.

What determines which way a river runs?
---------------------------------------

Quite a few factors affect the direction a river takes. First of all, water runs downhill due to gravity. It may flow northward or southward, to the east, or to the west, but always downhill. Topography plays a major role in determining a river’s course.

What is a body of water called a run?
-------------------------------------

These are just a very few among many, many other streams called runs. In fact, “run” seems to be the most common name for streams in the area.

How are rivers formed and how are they formed?
----------------------------------------------

How a River Flows. Rivers always flow downhill, of course! A stream, or a river, is formed whenever water moves downhill from one place to another. This means that most rivers begin high up in the mountains, where snow from the winter, or ancient glaciers, is melting.

Where does the water flow in a river?
-------------------------------------

It flows deep beneath the bottom of the river (the substrate), and it flows underneath the ground on both sides of it. If you are standing on the bank of a river, the river may well be flowing under your feet. This area underground where the river flows is called the hyporheic zone (hy-po-ree-ik).

What happens when you divert water from a river?
------------------------------------------------

When we divert water away from a river, we change the river’s natural flow. The second component of natural flow is how water moves through a river’s channel. In a natural, wild river, the water runs freely. But in more developed or degraded rivers, dams and other structures can slow or stop a river’s flow.

What can cause a river to run red?
----------------------------------

It was something out of Exodus: the Chongqing stretch of the Yangzhe River (Chang Jiang) turned as red as the flag of socialism. For a few days in September 2012, this river was the color of tomato soup — and the local officials and environmental agencies are still saying they have no idea what caused it. How can this happen?
