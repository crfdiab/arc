What type of rainfall is caused by mountains?
---------------------------------------------

Orographic precipitation  
Orographic precipitation, rain, snow, or other precipitation produced when moist air is lifted as it moves over a mountain range. As the air rises and cools, orographic clouds form and serve as the source of the precipitation, most of which falls upwind of the mountain ridge.

What kind of rainfall occurs due to obstruction from high mountain ranges?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

orographic rainfall  
They are obstructed by the high mountain ranges coming in their way. They start going upwards along the slope of the mountains, The temperature of these winds drop and condensation occurs and rainfall takes place. thsi type of rainfall due to obstruction is called orographic rainfall.

What are the two types of rain?
-------------------------------

Types of Rainfall

- Convectional rainfall.
- Orographic or relief rainfall.
- Cyclonic or frontal rainfall. Which rain occurs due to obstruction of the mountain?
    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    Rainfall occurs due to obstruction of mountain is known as\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ rain.
    
    What causes heavy rain in a tropical country?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    In tropical countries, when the ground surface is unevenly heated, especially on hot days, warm air rises to high altitudes and cold air takes its place with high velocity. Thus, at high altitude, the warm, moist air mass condenses and causes heavy rainfall. This is called convective rainfall.
    
    What kind of rain is caused by warm moist air?
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    It is also a kind of cyclonic rainfall. When a mass of warm moist air rushes from the surrounding zone to the lower pressure zone, a pocket is formed, and the warm moist air rises to a higher altitude like a chimney. At higher altitudes, it gets cooled adiabatically to form a cloud. Rainfall caused by such clouds is known as non-frontal rainfall.
    
    What are the major characteristics of orographic rainfall?
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    
    Orographic Rainfall â€“ Major Characteristics. When the saturated air mass comes across a mountain, it is forced to rise. The rising air expands, eventually, the temperature falls, and the moisture gets condensed. The principal characteristic of this type of rain is that the windward slopes get more rainfall.
    
    What kind of rainfall occurs at high altitude?
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    At the high altitude, it gets condensed and heavy rainfall occurs. This type of rainfall is called orographic rainfall.
