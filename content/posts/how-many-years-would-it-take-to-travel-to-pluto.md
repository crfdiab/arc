How many years would it take to travel to Pluto?
------------------------------------------------

9.5 years  
Launched in 2006, New Horizons is the fastest spacecraft to ever leave Earth. It crossed the orbit of Jupiter the next year and has been traveling nearly a million miles a day—but it still took 9.5 years for the spacecraft to reach Pluto and its moons.

How much does it cost to go to Pluto?
-------------------------------------

NASA’s New Horizons mission to Pluto showed us an entirely new world this week. And it did it for less than you might think. The whole mission cost about $700 million. That’s about $46.7 million per year for the 15 years in which scientists designed, built, and steered a probe to Pluto, 3 billion miles away.

What would happen to a human if they traveled to Pluto?
-------------------------------------------------------

But when Pluto is farthest from Earth, that message would travel for over 6.5 hours before reaching its destination. Depending on where it is in its orbit, you can expect freezing temperatures on Pluto that vary from minus 369 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 223 Celsius) to minus 387 F (minus 233 C).

Does Pluto have rain?
---------------------

Although it doesn’t rain on Pluto, various moons and planets throughout the solar system experience their own forms of precipitation. Saturn’s moon, Titan, experiences a methane rain cycle that’s similar to the water cycle on Earth.

Is it possible to send a spacecraft to Pluto?
---------------------------------------------

While such a spacecraft could be launched directly from the Earth’s surface, nuclear fallout concerns would make this course of action untenable. Instead, it would have to be constructed in Earth orbit — like the ISS — and depart for Pluto from there.

How long does it take the sun to travel from Pluto to Earth?
------------------------------------------------------------

One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 5.5 hours to travel from the sun to Pluto. If you were to stand on the surface of Pluto at noon, the sun would be 1/900 the brightness it is here on Earth, or about 300 times as bright as our full moon.

Is there a way to watch Pluto TV for free?
------------------------------------------

Despite its unique approach, Pluto TV offers a large amount of streaming content, it’s available to watch on a lot of different devices, and it’s completely free of charge. Recently, TV manufacturer VIZIO incorporated Pluto TV into its WatchFree service.

What would it be like to live on Pluto?
---------------------------------------

Whether you believe Pluto should still be considered a full-fledged planet or not, one thing is certain: The object is shrouded in mystery, and we don’t have a complete picture of what it would be like to live there. “We’ve never been to \[Pluto\] or anything like it,” planetary scientist Alan Stern told Space.com.
