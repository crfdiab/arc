How did Phoenicians use the sea?
--------------------------------

Sea Traders Because they didn’t have much room for growing crops, the ancient Phoenicians turned to the Mediterranean Sea and became traders instead of farmers. They created glassware from the sand along the coast to trade for things they needed.

How did Phoenicians navigate the waters of the Mediterranean?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Navigation. The Phoenicians did not have the compass or any other navigational instrument, and so they relied on natural features on coastlines, the stars, and dead-reckoning to guide their way and reach their destination.

When did the Phoenicians become dominant in the Mediterranean?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Phoenician people had been dominant sea traders in the Mediterranean prior to 1500 BC \[xvii\],\[xviii\] and in some cases had partnered with others to maintain that position. Then the rise of the Mycenaeans \[xix\] caused sea trade in the Aegean—and even as far as Cyprus—to fall into the hands of that new power.

What kind of people are the Phoenicians?

Where was the most northern city of the Phoenicians?
