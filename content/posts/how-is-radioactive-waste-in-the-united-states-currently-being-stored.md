How is radioactive waste in the United States currently being stored?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Commercial energy generation produces the majority of nuclear waste in the U.S., which remains stored above ground near each of the 99 commercial nuclear reactors scattered around the country. Nuclear waste is stored in pools to cool for many years, and some is moved to above-ground concrete casks.

How much nuclear waste is produced in the US per year?
------------------------------------------------------

The U.S. generates about 2,000 metric tons of used fuel each year. This number may sound like a lot, but it’s actually quite small. In fact, the U.S. has produced roughly 83,000 metrics tons of used fuel since the 1950s—and all of it could fit on a single football field at a depth of less than 10 yards.

How long is nuclear waste stored?
---------------------------------

Radioactive wastes are stored so as to avoid any chance of radiation exposure to people, or any pollution. The radioactivity of the wastes decays with time, providing a strong incentive to store high-level waste for about 50 years before disposal.

Where are nuclear wastes stored in the United States?
-----------------------------------------------------

The first is spent fuel from nuclear reactors used to generate electricity. Those reactors have left us with about 80,000 metric tonnes of used spent fuel, and we don’t have a way forward for the disposal of this waste. It’s stored at more than 75 sites in 35 states around the country, so many of us have some in our state, including California.

How much money has been spent on nuclear waste sites?
-----------------------------------------------------

The stranded sites are costly for the federal government, which has spent $7.4 billion to nuclear utilities and other reactor owners, according to CRS, to offset its responsibility to store the waste.

How many metric tons of spent nuclear fuel?
-------------------------------------------

High-level nuclear waste remains highly radioactive for tens of thousands of years and must be disposed of in such a way that it can be securely isolated for a long period of time. Civilian high-level waste. The nation has over 80,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power plants.

How many metric tons of nuclear waste are in Massachusetts?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Massachusetts: 720 metric tons The NRC recently designated the reactor at Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station in Plymouth, Massachusetts, as one of the nation’s three least-safe reactors. There are also more than 3,000 spent fuel assemblies currently cooling in the storage pool. Published:
