Who dropped balls from a famous tower?
--------------------------------------

scientist Galileo Galilei  
Between 1589 and 1592, the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei (then professor of mathematics at the University of Pisa) is said to have dropped two spheres of different masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass, according to a biography by Galileo’s …

Was Galileo correct?
--------------------

At a ceremony in Rome, before the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Pope John Paul II officially declared that Galileo was right. The formal rehabilitation was based on the findings of a committee of the Academy the Pope set up in 1979, soon after taking office.

What did Galileo discover about falling objects?
------------------------------------------------

Galileo Galilei—an Italian mathematician, scientist, and philosopher born in 1564—recognized that in a vacuum, all falling objects would accelerate at the same rate regardless of their size, shape, or mass. He arrived at that conclusion after extensive thought experiments and real-world investigations.

Did Galileo drop an orange?
---------------------------

The reference here is to the Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment. While the details are probably apocryphal, the legend goes that Galileo went to the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, dropped an orange and a grape off the side, and used it to prove that gravity was not dependent on the mass of the object.

Who dropped cannonballs off the Tower of Pisa?
----------------------------------------------

Galileo Galilei  
May 6, 2004: Four hundred years ago–or so the story goes–Galileo Galilei started dropping things off the Leaning Tower of Pisa: Cannon balls, musket balls, gold, silver and wood.

What Galileo was wrong about?
-----------------------------

In 1595, Galileo found evidence he felt proved the theory that Earth orbits the Sun. Although the theory that Earth orbits the Sun was correct, Galileo’s explanation for the tides was wrong, as this video segment adapted from NOVA explains.

Who was responsible for the Leaning Tower of Pisa?
--------------------------------------------------

Mr Galileo was correct in his findings.” The finding mentioned by Commander Scott, namely that objects of different mass fall at the same rate in a vacuum, is associated with a single person (Galileo) and a single place ­ the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The culprit is Vincenzio Viviani, Galileo’s secretary in the final years of his life.

What did Galileo use in the Pisa tower experiment?
--------------------------------------------------

That sounds crazy. So Thomas Settle and Donald Miklich reran Galileo’s tower experiment in front of a camera. An assistant held four-inch iron and wooden balls at arm’s length — as Galileo would have to have held them to clear the wide balustrate atop the Pisa tower.

Who is the mayor of the town of Pisa?
-------------------------------------

“The people of Pisa are delighted that the tower has been restored, but not that it has been straightened,” said Marco Filippeschi, the mayor of this town with a population of 85,000.

Why did Galileo drop objects from the Leaning Tower?
----------------------------------------------------

He dropped various objects from in order to measure how long it took for them to reach the bottom, coming to the remarkable conclusion that the objects’ weight did not affect the speed at which it fell. But does that really mean that a feather and a cannonball would fall at the same speed? Well, yes – as long as they were dropped in a vacuum.
