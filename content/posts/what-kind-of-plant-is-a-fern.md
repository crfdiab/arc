What kind of plant is a fern?
-----------------------------

vascular plants  
fern, (class Polypodiopsida), class of nonflowering vascular plants that possess true roots, stems, and complex leaves and that reproduce by spores.

Are ferns bryophytes?
---------------------

Summary – Bryophytes vs Ferns Bryophytes and ferns are two major groups of plants that belong to phylum Bryophyta and phylum Pteridophyta respectively. Both groups are primitive plants. The key difference between bryophytes and ferns is the presence and absence of vascular tissues.

Is fern a flowering plant?
--------------------------

Ferns are plants that do not have flowers. Similar to flowering plants, ferns have roots, stems and leaves. However, unlike flowering plants, ferns do not have flowers or seeds; instead, they usually reproduce sexually by tiny spores or sometimes can reproduce vegetatively, as exemplified by the walking fern.

Are ferns Pteridophytes?
------------------------

Ferns, horsetails (often treated as ferns), and lycophytes (clubmosses, spikemosses, and quillworts) are all pteridophytes. However, they do not form a monophyletic group because ferns (and horsetails) are more closely related to seed plants than to lycophytes.

Are ferns a good indoor plant?
------------------------------

Ferns can add a tropical look to your home. Many make wonderful, low-maintenance houseplants, as long as you’re careful to provide the right amounts of light and moisture. It’s also considered one of the most effective houseplants for removing air pollutants.

Do ferns grow well indoors?
---------------------------

Indoor ferns do best when they are kept out of direct light in north or east-facing windows. Sun exposure in south or west-facing windows is often too intense and may scald foliage. Ferns should be grown in a potting mix that provides good drainage and is high in organic matter.

What do bryophytes and ferns have in common?
--------------------------------------------

They’re Both Nonflowering Plants To reproduce sexually, mosses and ferns produce sperm and eggs. Ferns produce spores on the undersides of their fronds in cases called sporangia, and mosses produce their spores in capsules that are borne on the ends of stalks.

What is special about ferns?
----------------------------

Ferns are unique in land plants in having two separate living structures, so the ferny plant that we see out in the bush produces spores, and those spores, when they are released, don’t grow straight back into a new ferny plant. They grow into a little tiny plant that we call a gametophyte.

Where do ferns grow best?
-------------------------

Woodland ferns do best in high or dappled shade. The open shade of mature trees or the north side of the house or a wall, open to the sky, provide nearly ideal light conditions. Most woodland ferns will adapt to relatively low light levels, but no ferns thrive in deep shade.

Where should I place a fern in my house?
----------------------------------------

The best place for ferns is in a south-facing or north-facing window; if you want to place them near an east-facing or west-facing window, keep them a few feet away from the window to avoid burning the leaves. You don’t need a bright light in your house to grow ferns.

What kind of plant is a filicinophyta?
--------------------------------------

Filicinophyta (Pterophyta) A phylum of mainly terrestrial vascular plants (see tracheophyte) – the ferns.

What are the different types of Pteridophyta plants?
----------------------------------------------------

Classification of pteridophytes  For a long time the division Pteridophyta included-the ferns, lycopods and horsetails. On the basis of their anatomy Jeffrey in 1902 divided the vascular plants into two types or ‘stocks’.

Why is Pteridophyta no longer a valid taxon?
--------------------------------------------

Pteridophyta is no longer recognised as a valid taxon because it is paraphyletic. The ferns are also referred to as Polypodiophyta or, when treated as a subdivision of Tracheophyta (vascular plants), Polypodiopsida, although this name sometimes only refers to leptosporangiate ferns.

What kind of plant does not have a flower?
------------------------------------------

A fern is a member of a group of vascular plants (plants with xylem and phloem) that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers.
