Which moon is suitable for life?
--------------------------------

However, scientists only got to know about the intricacies of the planet and its moon in the 1950s. In its blog, NASA said that Europa have “conditions suitable for existing life”. This is because of its “salty ocean that lies under a thick layer of ice”.

Does the Moon have water air or life?
-------------------------------------

NASA has confirmed the presence of water on the moon’s sunlit surface, a breakthrough that suggests the chemical compound that is vital to life on Earth could be distributed across more parts of the lunar surface than the ice that has previously been found in dark and cold areas.

Does any moon have water?
-------------------------

How can water exist on the Moon? The existence of lunar water may seem strange, considering the Moon has no atmosphere and its surface is exposed to the vacuum of space. Daytime temperatures reach 120 degrees Celsius (248 degrees Fahrenheit). Any surface water in sunlit regions evaporates and then floats away.

Which moon is most likely to have water?
----------------------------------------

Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has shown geysers of water, confirmed by the Cassini spacecraft in 2005 and analyzed more deeply in 2008.

Who invented water on moon?
---------------------------

A proposed evidence of water ice on the Moon came in 1994 from the United States military Clementine probe. In an investigation known as the ‘bistatic radar experiment’, Clementine used its transmitter to beam radio waves into the dark regions of the south pole of the Moon.

Is there water on the surface of the Moon?
------------------------------------------

There’s Water on the Moon? Clavius Crater on the Moon. Credit: NASA/USGS. NASA recently announced that – for the first time – we’ve confirmed the water molecule, H 2 O, in sunlit areas of the Moon. This indicates that water is widely distributed across the lunar surface.

Are there any moons in our solar system that can support life?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The sixth largest of Saturn’s 62 confirmed moons, Enceladus boasts a massive saltwater ocean hidden beneath its icy surface. There are no detectable signs of life yet, but scientists are immensely intrigued because of the presence of liquid water and organic molecules, which are two of the key ingredients to support life as we know it.

Is there any life on the surface of the Moon?
---------------------------------------------

Log in to Reply. It is documented that there is no life on the surface of the moon. If any life exists on the moon at all, it is probably underground in caverns, and is likely to be organisms like the extremophiles on Earth, subsisting in underground caverns where small amounts of air and water may be trapped.

Are there any moons of Saturn that have liquid water?
-----------------------------------------------------

Tethys, Rhea, and Iapetus These moons of Saturn appear similarly frozen, though there’s an outside chance of liquid water on Rhea. These worlds are relatively inert, though Iapetus shows evidence of water sublimation (moving directly from solid to gas) on the surface.
