What was one of the main sources of the conflict between the United States and Japan?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How did the US respond to Japanese aggression?

Why did the US put economic sanctions on Japan?
-----------------------------------------------

The British government and the Dutch government-in-exile followed the lead of the United States in imposing economic sanctions on Japan.
