How did the Puritans interact with the natives?
-----------------------------------------------

The natives found Puritan conversion practices coercive and culturally insensitive. Accepting Christianity usually involved giving up their language, severing kinship ties with other Natives who had not been saved, and abandoning their traditional homes.

What was the relationship with natives like in New England?
-----------------------------------------------------------

While Native Americans and English settlers in the New England territories first attempted a mutual relationship based on trade and a shared dedication to spirituality, soon disease and other conflicts led to a deteriorated relationship and, eventually, the First Indian War.

What was the main reason for conflict between the Native Americans and the Puritan settlers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They hoped to transform the tribes people into civilized Christians through their daily contacts. The Native Americans resented and resisted the colonists’ attempts to change them. Their refusal to conform to European culture angered the colonists and hostilities soon broke out between the two groups.

How did the war of 1812 affect Native American tribes?
------------------------------------------------------

The War of 1812 created a lasting impact on several tribes whose communities were involved. For Native Americans, the War of 1812 created Indian heroes, established historic places, and dispossessed ancient home areas. The war forged alliances, called for leadership, and tore native communities apart.

Why did the Puritans come to New England?
-----------------------------------------

Noteworthy, when the Puritans arrived in New England, their most important role was to convert the Natives based on the belief that the Native American groups were ‘the lost tribes of Israel’ (Bowden 21). They thought that it was their duty to enlighten these lost tribes back to the right religion.

What was the relationship between the Quakers and the Puritans?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Quakers relationship with the Native Americans was more or less better than the relationship between the Puritans and the Native Americans. At first, the Quakers participated in a cultural genocide against the Indians. The Quakers and other groups of people strived to make Indians feel that their culture was worthless.

What was the religion of the New England colonies?
--------------------------------------------------

The primary religion of the New England colonies was the strict Puritan Christianity originally brought to the Massachusetts Bay colony by ships like the Mayflower, but as the colonies grew and changed, some of the colonists began to move away from that base. So too did views on the Native Americans who shared their land.

Who are some famous people who rebelled against Puritanism?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Their attitudes about the Native Americans also evolved. A famous example of this is Roger Williams, who rebelled against Puritanism and founded the colony of Rhode Island. Williams held the unorthodox view that colonists had no right to occupy land without purchasing it from Native Americans.
