At what degree can you see Polaris?
-----------------------------------

3 Answers. Currently Polaris is at a declination of a bit over 89 degrees, which means that no one south of 1 degree south latitude can see Polaris. That’s almost all of the Southern hemisphere, let alone the South Pole.

Where on Earth would you be if Polaris was on the horizon?
----------------------------------------------------------

Where on Earth would you be if Polaris was at your zenith? North Pole.

At which latitude will Polaris be on the horizon?
-------------------------------------------------

90 degrees latitude  
(30 degrees latitude)– Polaris is located 30 degrees above the northern horizon. This trend continues until the traveler reaches the geographic (not magnetic) North Pole. At this point (90 degrees latitude), Polaris is 90 degrees above the northern horizon and appears directly overhead.

Can you see Polaris from the south of the equator?
--------------------------------------------------

As you travel south, Polaris drops closer to the northern horizon. From the equator, Polaris sinks to the horizon and cannot be seen from the South of the equator. In the Northern Hemisphere, finding Polaris means you know the direction north. Even when the full moon obscures the sky, the North Star is relatively easy to see.

Where is Polaris located in the North Pole?
-------------------------------------------

This is because Polaris is basically always located within one degree of the North Pole. This shot is available when you are sailing in the North Hemisphere above 5 degrees or so latitude.

How to find the latitude of a star in Polaris?
----------------------------------------------

Subtract 1 degree to the total and that is your latitude. There are examples at the bottom of the Polaris tables and of course the “Latitude by Polaris” section of our Sight Reduction for Stars form will walk you through it as well. On 27 November 2014 you’re in DR Latitude 15º 30 N and DR Longitude 64º 15 W.

How do you correct the altitude of Polaris?
-------------------------------------------

For the altitude correction, Polaris is a star of course, so use the almanac’s Altitude Correction Table, under the “Stars and Planets” column as for any other star. 3. LHA Aries: Lift off the GHA Aries for your date and hour of GMT from the daily pages, correct for the minutes and seconds increment of your GMT.
