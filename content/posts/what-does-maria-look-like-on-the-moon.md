What does maria look like on the Moon?
--------------------------------------

In actuality, maria are huge basins containing lava flows marked by craters, ridges, faults, and straight and meandering valleys called rilles and are devoid of water. There are about 20 major areas of this type, most of them—including the largest ones—located on the side of the Moon that always faces Earth.

How did maria form on the Moon?
-------------------------------

The maria were formed after large impacts from meteors carved out basins in the lunar crust. When the Moon was volcanic, magma seeped to the surface, filled the basins and eventually hardened, resulting in the relatively smooth flat areas seen today.

What is the surface texture of the maria on the Moon?
-----------------------------------------------------

Geologically, the Lunar surface material has the following characteristics: The Maria are mostly composed of dark basalts, which form from rapid cooling of molten rock from massive lava flows.

What are small maria called?
----------------------------

The few maria on the far side are much smaller, residing mostly in very large craters. The traditional nomenclature for the Moon also includes one oceanus (ocean), as well as features with the names lacus (lake), palus (marsh), and sinus (bay).

What forms maria on the Moon Group of answer choices?
-----------------------------------------------------

The lunar maria /ˈmɑːriə/ (singular: mare /ˈmɑːreɪ/) are large, dark, basaltic plains on Earth’s Moon, formed by ancient volcanic eruptions. They were dubbed maria, Latin for “seas”, by early astronomers who mistook them for actual seas.

How did Maria on the Moon get its name?
---------------------------------------

Describe what maria on the surface of the moon look like and how they came to be known as maria? Maria are large, dark, basaltic plains on the moon. Galileo named these places ‘maria’ after the Latin word for sea because he thought they looked like oceans.

Why are maria craters darker than the rest of the Moon?
-------------------------------------------------------

Maria are darker than the rest of the surface because the volcanic rock they are made from is full of iron, which is less reflective than other Moon rock materials. Further impacts over the course of billions of years added more craters, shaping the Moon we see today.

How did Galileo come up with the name Maria?
--------------------------------------------

Maria are large, dark, basaltic plains on the moon. Galileo named these places ‘maria’ after the Latin word for sea because he thought they looked like oceans. Compare the thickness of the moon’s crust on the near side with the thickness of the crust on the far side.

Which is the less cratered side of the Moon?
--------------------------------------------

The maria are much less cratered than the highlands, and cover just 17% of the lunar surface, mostly on the side of the Moon that faces Earth (Figure 3b). Figure 3: Lunar Mountain and Lunar Maria.
