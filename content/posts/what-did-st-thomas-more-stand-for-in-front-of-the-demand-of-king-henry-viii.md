What did St Thomas More stand for in front of the demand of King Henry VIII?

Is Thomas More’s utopia a dystopia?
-----------------------------------

Sure, we can see a lot of flaws and may say that More’s Utopia is one of the very first dystopian fiction novels in history.

Why was Henry more known as Master of requests?
-----------------------------------------------

More’s success in the thorny negotiations with the French at Calais and Boulogne (September to December 1517) over suits born of the recent war made it harder for him to dodge royal service. That year he became a member of the king’s council and from October was known as master of requests.

Why did the pope not allow Henry to get remarried?

The pope did not allow this, however, because of a previous dispensation that Henry had received to marry her. Because Henry VIII had declared himself the head of the Church, he now had the authority to dissolve his marriage and get remarried. More kept his silence on the subject.

-----------------------------------------------

However, he is most known for being the Lord Chancellor of England from October 1529 to May 1532. More resigned his position in 1532, because King Henry VIII claimed spiritual authority over the Catholic Church in England.
