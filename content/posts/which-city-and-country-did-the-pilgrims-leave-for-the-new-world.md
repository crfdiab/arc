Which city and country did the pilgrims leave for the New World?
----------------------------------------------------------------

England  
Mayflower was an English ship that transported a group of English families, known today as the Pilgrims, from England to the New World in 1620.

Where did the pilgrims depart from?
-----------------------------------

Plymouth, England  
The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England, on 6 September 1620 and arrived at Cape Cod on 9 November 1620, after a 66 day voyage.

Where did the pilgrims go in the new world?
-------------------------------------------

Some 100 people, many of them seeking religious freedom in the New World, set sail from England on the Mayflower in September 1620. That November, the ship landed on the shores of Cape Cod, in present-day Massachusetts.

What was the Pilgrims town called?
----------------------------------

Plymouth  
‘Pilgrim’ became (by the early 1800s at least) the popular term applied to all the Mayflower passengers – and even to other people arriving in Plymouth in those early years – so that the English people who settled Plymouth in the 1620s are generally called the Pilgrims.

How did the pilgrims get to the New World?
------------------------------------------

They were a crucial group in the history of the US. They were an ostracised religious group that escaped from England and came to live in Leiden. From there, they would sail to the New World.

Where was the first stop for the pilgrims?
------------------------------------------

Most school children in America learn about the Pilgrims —the group of English settlers who endured a harrowing journey to the New World in 1620 on the Mayflower. It is sometimes overlooked, however, that Plymouth was not the first stop for this congregation of religious separatists from the town of Scrooby in the English county of Nottinghamshire.

When did the pilgrims sail back to England?
-------------------------------------------

The Pilgrims bought a small ship called the Speedwell and sailed back to England. They stayed long enough to get more colonists and a larger ship, the Mayflower. They set sail from Southampton on August 5, 1620. The Speedwell wasn’t in shape to make the journey, and the Pilgrims returned to Plymouth, England.

Where did the pilgrims settle in New England?
