Would the sky be brighter without the moon?
-------------------------------------------

Nights would be much, much darker. The next brightest object in the night sky is Venus. But it still wouldn’t be enough to light up the sky. A full moon is nearly two thousand times brighter than Venus is at its brightest.

Does the moon actually light up?
--------------------------------

Unlike a lamp or our sun, the moon doesn’t produce its own light. Moonlight is actually sunlight that shines on the moon and bounces off. The light reflects off old volcanoes, craters, and lava flows on the moon’s surface.

Does the moon affect anything?
------------------------------

According to Tom, there are three main ways in which the Moon impacts on life: time, tides and light. ‘For many animals, particularly birds, the Moon is essential to migration and navigation. Other will time their reproduction to coincide with the specific phases of the lunar cycle.

Why does the moon shine in the night sky?
-----------------------------------------

The moon shines because its surface reflects light from the sun. But because of its orbit around Earth, the lighting goes through phases.

Why does the brightness of the Moon increase?
---------------------------------------------

The brightness of any object, including the moon, in the sky increases with its height in the sky. When an object is directly overhead, its light strikes the ground at a right angle, and the intensity of light is the same as the intensity in the beam.

Why does the Moon appear at different times in the sky?
-------------------------------------------------------

But because the moon is also doing a lap around the Earth, the moon is going to appear at different points in the sky at different times of the day and night. So sometimes the moon will be up during the day. Alan – So we see the Sun and moon at the same time?

Why is the sky blue from the Moon?
----------------------------------

The size of the full Moon in the night sky is only 1/2 of a degree. There are 180 degrees from horizon to horizon, so it is far too small to cast much light. If the full Moon reflected as much light as the Earth (about 37%) it would be bright enough to give the night sky a noticeably brighter blue color.
