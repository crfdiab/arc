What did the Millikan experiment determine?
-------------------------------------------

Millikan oil-drop experiment, first direct and compelling measurement of the electric charge of a single electron. Millikan was able to measure both the amount of electric force and magnitude of electric field on the tiny charge of an isolated oil droplet and from the data determine the magnitude of the charge itself.

What was concluded as a result of the oil drop experiment?
----------------------------------------------------------

Milliken’s Oil Drop Experiment Conclusion The charge over any oil droplet is always an integral value of e (1.6 x 10-19). Hence, the conclusion of Millikens Oil Drop Experiment is that the charge is said to be quantized, i.e. the charge on any particle will always be an integral multiple of e.

What experiment did Robert Millikan do apex?
--------------------------------------------

Answer: he used voltage adjustments to make charged oil drops float.

What is the importance of Millikan’s oil drop experiment?
---------------------------------------------------------

Millikan’s experiment is important because it established the charge on an electron. Millikan used a very simple a very simple apparatus in which he balanced the actions of gravitational, electric, and (air) drag forces. Using this apparatus, he was able to calculate that the charge on an electron was 1.60 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.

Why did Millikan use oil instead of water?
------------------------------------------

Professor Millikan has made several innovations to improve the experiment. First, droplets of oil are used instead of water, to reduce the tendency of the droplets to evaporate while the experiment is being performed. was later traced to the fact that Millikan’s value of the viscosity of air had been a little low.

Will Millikan oil drop experiment work in a vacuum?
---------------------------------------------------

It worked! They refined the apparatus and eventually used vacuum pump oil. It had an extremely low vapour pressure and would not evaporate under the heat of the light source.

What did Millikan’s oil drop experiment reveal about the nature of matter?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation: Millikan’s oil drop experiment proved that electric charge is quantized. At the time, there was still great debate whether electric charge was continuous or not. Millikan believed that there was a smallest unit of charge, and he set out to prove it.

Who did the oil drop experiment?
--------------------------------

Robert Millikan’s  
Robert Millikan’s famous oil drop experiment, reported in August 1913, elegantly measured the fundamental unit of electric charge.

Which liquid is used in Millikan oil drop experiment?
-----------------------------------------------------

Ernest Z. Millikan used vacuum pump oil for his experiment.

What was used to cause the oil drops to pick up electrons?
----------------------------------------------------------

The X-rays ionized the air, causing electrons to attach to the oil drops. The oil drops picked up static charge and were suspended between two charged plates.

What oil did Millikan use?
--------------------------

vacuum pump oil  
Millikan used vacuum pump oil for his experiment.

What did Millikan’s oil drop experiment measure?
------------------------------------------------

elementary electric charge  
The oil drop experiment was performed by Robert A. Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in 1909 to measure the elementary electric charge (the charge of the electron). The experiment took place in the Ryerson Physical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. Millikan received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1923.

When did Robert Millikan invent the oil drop experiment?
--------------------------------------------------------

Millikan oil-drop experiment, first direct and compelling measurement of the electric charge of a single electron. It was performed originally in 1909 by the American physicist Robert A. Millikan, who devised a method of measuring the minute electric charge that is present on many of the droplets in an oil mist.

What was the purpose of the millikens experiment?
-------------------------------------------------

The Millikens Oil Drop Experiment was an experiment performed by Robert A. Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in 1909 to measure the charge of an electron. This experiment proved to be very crucial in the physics community.

Who was the professor in the Millikan experiment?
-------------------------------------------------

The year is 1911, and you are taking a physics course. Your professor is Robert Millikan. Professor Millikan has you and your classmates doing a lab experiment to measure ethe magnitude of the charge of an electron, as well as to determine if charge is quantized (in other words, to see whether charge comes only in integer multiples of e).

Why did Millikan win the Nobel Prize for Physics?
-------------------------------------------------

In 1923, Millikan won the Nobel Prize in physics in part because of this experiment. Aside from discerning an electron’s charge, the beauty of the oil drop experiment lies in its simple and elegant demonstration that charge is actually quantized.
