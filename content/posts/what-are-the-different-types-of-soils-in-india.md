-----------------------------------------------

There are seven soil deposits in India. They are alluvial soil, black soil, red soil, laterite soil, or arid soil, and forest and mountainous soil,marsh soil. These soils are formed by the sediments brought down by the rivers. They are also have varied chemical properties.

What are the different types of soil found in India and where are they found?

Soils of India: Six Different Types of Soils Found in India

- Alluvial Soils: These are formed by the deposition of sediments by rivers.
- Black Soils: These soils are made up of volcanic rocks and lava-flow.
- Red Soils:
- Laterite Soils:
- Mountain Soils:
- Desert Soils: Which type of soil is found mostly in India?
    --------------------------------------------
    
    Alluvial soil  
    Alluvial soil is of two types – (i) old alluvium known as bangar, and (ii) new alluvium called khaddar. It is the most important type of soil found in the country as it covers about 40% of the total land.
    
    What are six types of soil?
    ---------------------------
    
    There are six main soil types:
    
    
    - Clay.
    - Sandy.
    - Silty.
    - Peaty.
    - Chalky.
    - Loamy. Which is the most common type of soil in India?
        -----------------------------------------------
        
        Saline-Alkaline soil is found in canal areas. In moderate arid condition, calcification occurs and in extreme arid conditions, salinity occurs. Major areas of Saline and Alkaline soils in India are – Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra etc.
        
        Where are the black soils found in India?
        -----------------------------------------
        
        These soils are commonly found in central, western and southern states of India including Maharashtra, Western parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and some parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Black soils are characterized by a dark grey to black colour, high clay content, and neutral to slightly alkaline in reaction.
        
        Where are saline and alkaline soils found in India?
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        Saline-Alkaline soil is found in canal areas. In moderate arid condition, calcification occurs and in extreme arid conditions, salinity occurs. Major areas of Saline and Alkaline soils in India are – Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra etc. The soil is best for crops like Seem, Rice, Sugarcane, Fruits, Spices etc. 7.
        
        What kind of crops are grown in South India?
        --------------------------------------------
        
        Plantation of crops like tropical fruits, coffee, tea or spices in states of south India like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are undertaken in this type of soil. In the drier areas or deciduous forest belt, deep soil, brown in colour and rich in humus is found.
