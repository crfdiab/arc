Is there snow on top of the Andes Mountains?
--------------------------------------------

Every austral winter in the central Andes, fresh snowfall covers and fills the gaps between mountaintops that have more permanent snow and ice. The Andes span about 7,200 kilometers (4,500 miles) along the western side of South America, passing through multiple climate regions from dry to wet.

How cold is the top of the Andes Mountains?
-------------------------------------------

In winter the temperatures usually averages about less than 52°F. In the summer it usually averages 68°F. These temperatures are mainly from biomes around and in the Andes Mountains. The precipitation of the Andes Mountain climate changes but not drastically between two places.

Why do the peaks in the Andes Mountains remain covered with snow?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

As you climb a mountain to a higher altitude (height), the atmosphere gets thinner and thinner. This is because air pressure decreases with altitude. Even though warm air rises, as it does so the rising air expands and cools. More moisture means more rain and, at the very top of a mountain, more snow.

How is the winter in the Andes Mountains?
-----------------------------------------

Winter in the Andes. Every austral winter in the central Andes, fresh snowfall covers and fills the gaps between mountaintops that have more permanent snow and ice. The continuous strip of winter white is visible in this image, acquired on July 30, 2018, with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite.

How tall is the average height of the Andes Mountains?
------------------------------------------------------

The average height of the Andes is 4,000 meters. However, it has several summits with a height of over 6,000 meters. The mountain range can be divided into the southern Andes, the central Andes and the northern Andes.

Where are the Andes Mountains located in South America?
-------------------------------------------------------

The Andes span about 7,200 kilometers (4,500 miles) along the western side of South America, passing through multiple climate regions from dry to wet. This image shows a part of the Andes in central Chile and Argentina that bridges the two climate zones.

Why are glaciers more common in the Andes Mountains?
----------------------------------------------------

In the high Andes of central Chile and Mendoza Province, rock glaciers are larger and more common than glaciers; this is due to the high exposure to solar radiation. Though precipitation increases with the height, there are semiarid conditions in the nearly 7,000-metre (23,000 ft) highest mountains of the Andes.
