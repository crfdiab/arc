Are any Uggs still made in Australia?
-------------------------------------

When did Ugg stop using Ugg Australia?

Do they kill the sheep to make UGGs?
------------------------------------

UGG boots are made of shearling—yep, that’s skin with the fleece still attached, people! Every year, millions of sheep are castrated and parts of their tails are cut off—often without any painkillers—before they’re finally slaughtered for their skin, which is what UGG boots are made of.
