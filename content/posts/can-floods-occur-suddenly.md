Can floods occur suddenly?
--------------------------

Floods can occur suddenly Heavy, intense rainfall can occur suddenly, and the quickly rising floods caused by this in the minutes or hours after the rainfall are known as flash floods. Flash floods are typically associated with relatively small catchment areas where there may be little or no permanent flow of water.

What is the fastest flood in the world?
---------------------------------------

The deadliest flash flood in history occurred on August 11, 1979 in the town of Morbi in the Indian state of Gujarat. The Machchhu II dam is located on the Machhu river and burst after holding back several days of heavy rainfall.

Do floods happen fast or slow?
------------------------------

Most flash flooding is caused by slow-moving thunderstorms, thunderstorms repeatedly moving over the same area, or heavy rains from hurricanes and tropical storms. Floods, on the other hand, can be slow- or fast-rising, but generally develop over a period of hours or days.

How do you know if a flash flood is coming?
-------------------------------------------

Flash Flood “Red Flags” Listen for news of dam or levee failures. Watch for slow-moving storms that repeatedly move over the same area. Hurricanes are another big source of intense rain. If you see water is collecting in pools, this is a sign the ground is oversaturated with water and that flooding can occur.

How high can floods get?
------------------------

Flash floods can bring walls of water from 10 to 20 feet high. A car can be taken away in as little as 2 feet of water. To stay safe during a flood, go to the highest ground of floor possible.

How long does it take for a flood to happen?
--------------------------------------------

A flood is an overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods can happen almost anywhere. They can cover an area with just a few inches of water or they can bring enough water to cover the roof of a house. Floods can be dangerous for communities, lasting days, weeks or sometimes even longer. Many different situations can cause a flood.

How often does flooding occur in the United States?
---------------------------------------------------

Flooding occurs in every U.S. state and territory, and is a threat experienced anywhere in the world that receives rain. In the U.S. floods kill more people each year than tornadoes, hurricanes or lightning.

When do flash floods happen in severe weather?
----------------------------------------------

Severe Weather 101. Flash floods occur when excessive water fills normally dry creeks or river beds along with currently flowing creeks and rivers, causing rapid rises of water in a short amount of time. They can happen with little or no warning.

How does a flood occur and what causes it?
------------------------------------------

A flood is the accumulation of water over normally dry land. It’s caused by the overflow of inland waters (like rivers and streams) or tidal waters, or by an unusual accumulation of water from sources such as heavy rains or dam or levee breaches. This occurs when a river or stream overflows its natural banks and inundates normally dry land.
