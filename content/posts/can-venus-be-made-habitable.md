Can Venus be made habitable?
----------------------------

Adjustments to the existing environment of Venus to support human life would require at least three major changes to the planet’s atmosphere: Eliminating most of the planet’s dense 9.2 MPa (91 atm) carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide atmosphere via removal or conversion to some other form.

Why Venus is not habitable?
---------------------------

Venus’ surface is extremely dry. During its evolution, ultraviolet rays from the sun evaporated water quickly, keeping the planet in a prolonged molten state. There is no liquid water on its surface today because the scorching heat created by its ozone-filled atmosphere would cause water to immediately boil away.

Can we breathe on Earth?
------------------------

We’re able to breathe on earth because the atmosphere is a mixture of gases, with the thickest gases nearest the earth’s surface, giving us the oxygen we need to breathe. In space, there is very little breathable oxygen.

Can Venus ever support life?
----------------------------

To date, no definitive proof has been found of past or present life on Venus. With extreme surface temperatures reaching nearly 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F) and an atmospheric pressure 90 times that of Earth, the conditions on Venus make water-based life as we know it unlikely on the surface of the planet.

Is it possible that Venus was once habitable?
---------------------------------------------

Observations suggest Venus may have had water oceans in its distant past. A land-ocean pattern like that above was used in a climate model to show how storm clouds could have shielded ancient Venus from strong sunlight and made the planet habitable.

Is the surface of Venus really Earth like?
------------------------------------------

Venus is a very strange place, totally uninhabitable, except perhaps in the clouds some 60 kilometers up where the recent discovery of phosphine may suggest floating microbial life. But the surface is totally inhospitable. However, Venus once likely had an Earth-like climate.

What was the climate like on Venus in the past?
-----------------------------------------------

However, Venus once likely had an Earth-like climate. According to recent climate modeling, for much of its history Venus had surface temperatures similar to present day Earth. It likely also had oceans, rain, perhaps snow, maybe continents and plate tectonics, and even more speculatively, perhaps even surface life.

Is it true that Venus used to have an ocean?
--------------------------------------------

Scientists long have theorized that Venus formed out of ingredients similar to Earth’s, but followed a different evolutionary path. Measurements by NASA’s Pioneer mission to Venus in the 1980s first suggested Venus originally may have had an ocean.
