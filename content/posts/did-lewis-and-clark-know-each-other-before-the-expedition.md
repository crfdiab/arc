Did Lewis and Clark know each other before the expedition?
----------------------------------------------------------

Before the expedition, Lewis was Jefferson’s private presidential secretary. He also served in the military, where he met Clark. Clark lived for many years and held various government positions, including Superintendent of Indian Affairs and Governor of the Missouri Territory.

Why did people move west Lewis and Clark?
-----------------------------------------

Lewis and Clark mostly avoided conflicts with Indians. And a Native American woman, Sacagawea, traveled with the expedition as an interpreter. So one unstated purpose of the expedition was to survey the area and thus provide knowledge that could be useful to later Americans who would travel west.

What was the purpose of Lewis and Clark’s journey?
--------------------------------------------------

What was the purpose of the Lewis and Clark Expedition? Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–06) was a U.S. military expedition, led by Captain Meriwether Lewis and Lieutenant William Clark, to explore the Louisiana Purchase and the Pacific Northwest.

What did Americans know before Lewis and Clark Expedition?
----------------------------------------------------------

Before Lewis and Clark completed their expedition, Americans could only speculate on what lurked in the uncharted territories beyond the Rocky Mountains.

Why did Lewis and Clark take York with them?
--------------------------------------------

Clark often chose York as one of the men to accompany him on scouting trips and, when game was scarce later on in the journey, York was sent with only one other man to barter for food with the Nez Perce, whose hospitality proved crucial to the expedition’s success.

When did Lewis and Clark first leave St Louis?
----------------------------------------------

When the expedition first left from St. Louis on May 14, 1804, not all of its members—all of whom were white and many of whom had been raised in the South, were eager to have an African-American at their side. And they weren’t shy about sharing their opinions.

Who was the leader of the westward expansion?
---------------------------------------------

The real leaders of this movement that lasted for over half a century were Lewis Meriwether and Clark William. Due to American’s settling in the west, many future events that also impated history were able to be made. The gold rush would not have been possible if pioneers like Lewis and Clark hadn’t begun the journey that lead America forward.
