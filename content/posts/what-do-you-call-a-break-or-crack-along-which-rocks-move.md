What do you call a break or crack along which rocks move?
---------------------------------------------------------

A break or crack along which rocks move is called. a fault.

Why do cracks form in rocks?
----------------------------

That breakup occurs when environmental, gravitational or tectonic stresses act to sever molecular bonds within the rock, causing cracks to form or grow. As cracks intersect, smaller pieces of rock are separated. The process happens over and again, releasing bedrock from the crust of the Earth and downsizing boulders.

What are cracks in nature?
--------------------------

Cracks. Cracks are linear openings that form in materials to relieve stress. When an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks meet at a node.

How do you break a small rock?
------------------------------

For smaller rocks, a rock hammer/pick or household hammer will work fine. Put the bag of rocks on a firm surface (concrete or asphalt), and knock gently. Slowly apply more pressure, until you feel the rocks start to break. Check your progress, remove rocks that are already small enough, then continue.

How do you break a rock without blasting it?
--------------------------------------------

Dexpan is a cement with amazing 18,000 psi expansive strength when mixed with water. Poured into pre-drilled holes, Dexpan can break concrete and rocks safely and quietly, while providing silent cracking. It is safe, easy and cost effective. AKA Dexpan Expansive Demolition Grout, Rock Splitting Compound Chemical.

What causes rocks to crack at the surface?
------------------------------------------

There are a number of ways this happens. A common process is that rocks crack as they get exhumed, which is to say when they get closer to the surface as erosion occurs at the surface. The release of pressure causes the rocks to expand slightly and this can cause them to crack. Weathering processes can also crack…

What kind of rock climbing is crack climbing?
---------------------------------------------

Crack climbing is a type of rock climbing in which the climber follows a crack in the rock and uses specialized climbing techniques.

How big is a crack in a rock wall?
----------------------------------

The sizes of cracks vary from those that are just barely wide enough for the fingers to fit inside, to those that are so wide that the entire body can fit inside with all limbs outstretched. Many traditional climbing routes follow crack systems, as they provide natural opportunities for placing protective equipment.

How does crack rock work as an anesthetic?
------------------------------------------

Like cocaine in other forms, crack rock acts as a local anesthetic, numbing the tongue or mouth only where directly placed. Purer forms of crack will sink in water or melt at the edges when near a flame (crack vaporizes at 90 °C, 194 °F).
