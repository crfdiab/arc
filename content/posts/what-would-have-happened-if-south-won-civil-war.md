What would have happened if South won civil war?
------------------------------------------------

First, the outcome of the victory of the South could have been another Union, ruled by the Southern States. The United-States of America would have another capital in Richmond. Their industrious prosperity would have been stopped and slavery would have remained in all the United-States for a long time.

Who would have been president of the South won the Civil War?
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you were from a Southern state, you may have answered Jefferson Davis. On November 6, 1861, Jefferson Davis was elected president, not of the United States of America but of the Confederate States of America. He ran unopposed and was elected to serve for a six-year term.

Did the Confederates almost win the Civil War?
----------------------------------------------

Early in the American Civil War, the Confederacy almost won. It was not the complete victory the Union eventually achieved. Rather than conquering their opponents, the Confederates hoped to force them to the negotiating table, where the division of the states could be accomplished.

When was if the south had won the Civil War?
--------------------------------------------

If the South Had Won the Civil War. If the South Had Won the Civil War is a 1961 alternate history book by MacKinlay Kantor, a writer who also wrote several novels about the American Civil War as it actually happened. It was originally published in the November 22, 1960, issue of Look magazine.

What was the outcome of the American Civil War?
-----------------------------------------------

It took place between 1861 and 1865, making 617.000 deaths, more than both World-Wars (still according to US deaths). It achieved on stronger United-States, with the consolidation of American institutions, the abolition of slavery and the industrial development of the Nordic states.

Why was the north gracious to the south during the Civil War?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The North has always been rather gracious about the Civil War, allowing the South to propound its romantic myths without correction. In the interests of national unity, this was probably for the best, but every so often a reality check, even in the form of fantasy, becomes necessary.

What kind of economy would the south have had after the Civil War?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Its transition to the post-industrial era and to the tertiary age would have been fastened. On the other hand, the confederal south would have remained in a primary economy close to Latin America and South America. Its economy would have relatively declined, to the extent to be dependent of the North.
