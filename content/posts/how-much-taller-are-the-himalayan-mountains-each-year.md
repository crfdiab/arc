Scientists believe that the Eurasian Plate may now be stretching out rather than thrusting up, and such stretching would result in some subsidence due to gravity.

What are some interesting facts about the Himalayas?
----------------------------------------------------

1 The Himalayas are the result of tectonic plate motions that collided India into Tibet. 2 Because of the great amount of tectonic motion still occurring at the site, the Himalayas have a proportionally high number of earthquakes and tremors. 3 The Himalayas are one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet.
