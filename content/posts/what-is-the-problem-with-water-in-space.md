What is the problem with water in space?
----------------------------------------

A water drop and air bubble in outer space. Consider what would happen on Earth: The air bubble, lighter than water, would race upward to burst through the surface of the droplet. In space, the air bubble doesn’t rise because it is no lighter than the water around it—there’s no buoyancy.

What happens to the water collected on the ISS?
-----------------------------------------------

Water is lost by the Space Station in several ways: the water recycling systems produce a small amount of unusable brine; the oxygen-generating system consumes water; air that’s lost in the air locks takes humidity with it; and the CO2 removal systems leach some water out of the air, to name a few.

Why don t astronauts bring their own water?
-------------------------------------------

Water is heavy, quickly used and expensive to get into orbit. To put it into perspective, it costs $10,000 per pound to launch a spaceship, and a gallon of water weighs 8.33 pounds. Astronauts are limited to three gallons a day when they’re in space, but that still adds up.

How do astronauts get water on the space station?
-------------------------------------------------

The ISS has a complex water management system that extracts every last drop of water it can access, whether it comes from people’s breath, recycled shower water, residue from hand-washing and oral hygiene, astronauts’ sweat and even urine!

How much water does an astronaut need per day?
----------------------------------------------

about 50 liters  
Each astronaut will be able to use about 50 liters of water per day. The water will be recycled, which takes much less energy than extracting it from the Martian soil.

Do astronauts eat poop?
-----------------------

The scientists of the Penn University said that the new process includes mixing human excreta with microbes which will eventually turn it into edible substance.

What foods are not allowed in space?
------------------------------------

7 Foods astronauts aren’t allowed to eat in space

- Bread. Even when you’re on your best behavior, biting into that sandwich is still going to create some crumbs.
- Salt and pepper.
- Alcohol.
- Soda / Pop.
- Astronaut ice cream.
- Fish.
- Chips.

How do female astronauts pee in space?
--------------------------------------

To pee, they can sit or stand and then hold the funnel and hose tightly against their skin so that nothing leaks out. To poop, astronauts lift the toilet lid and sit on the seat – just like here on Earth.

Why did NASA not put water on Space Station?
--------------------------------------------

NASA knew it forfeited two important consumables but did not have the money to put a more effective system into the baseline for the station.

Is the gravity of water negligible in space?
--------------------------------------------

Water is a sphere in space. But, if you go far enough out in space, for instance, onto the International Space Station, gravity becomes negligible, and the laws of physics act differently than here on Earth.

What happens to a water drop in outer space?
--------------------------------------------

How is water recycled on the Space Station?
-------------------------------------------

“We have to recycle. There’s already a Russian-built water processor in orbit that collects humidity from the air. Here at Marshall we’re building a regenerative system that will be able to recycle almost every drop of water on the station and support a crew of seven with minimal resupplies.”
