When evaporation and condensation are equal it is called?
---------------------------------------------------------

The condensation rate will continue to increase until it matches the evaporation rate, which is a state called equilibrium, meaning the condensation rate equals the evaporation rate.

What is the difference between condensation and water vapour?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Water vapor in the air reaches its dew point as it cools in the air around the can, forming liquid drops of water. Condensation is the process where water vapor becomes liquid. It is the reverse of evaporation, where liquid water becomes a vapor.

Is evaporation the opposite of condensation?
--------------------------------------------

The opposite of evaporation is condensation. While evaporation is the process of liquid changing into a gas, condensation is the process of a gasâ€¦

Why is condensation called the opposite of evaporation?
-------------------------------------------------------

Opposite process of evaporation is condensation. During condensation, liquid water is formed from water vapour by cooling. Condensation is the change of the physical state of matter from the gaseous phase into its liquid phase, and is the reverse process of vaporization.

Is freezing the opposite of evaporation?
----------------------------------------

If warm, humid air (such as your breath) blows over a cold surface (such as a piece of metal kept in the freezer), ice will condense onto the surface directly from the vapor. If the point of 100% humidity is above freezing, rain forms as the temperature falls. This is the opposite of evaporation.

What is the reverse process of evaporation called?
--------------------------------------------------

Condensation, the opposite of evaporation, occurs when saturated air is cooled below the dew point (the temperature to which air must be cooled at a constant pressure for it to become fully saturated with water), such as on the outside of a glass of ice water.

What is the difference between evaporation and condensation?
------------------------------------------------------------

Evaporation is a process of changing the liquid phase into vapors/gases. Condensation is the process of changing vapors/gases into liquid or droplets of water. Change from liquid to vapor. Change from vapor to liquid. It absorbs energy from the surroundings. Releases energy to the surrounding.

What happens to matter in the process of evaporation?
-----------------------------------------------------

 Evaporation and condensation are two processes through which matter changes from one state to another. Matter can exist in three different states: solid, liquid, or gas. In evaporation, matter changes from a liquid to a gas. In condensation, matter changes from a gas to a liquid. All matter is made of tiny moving particles called molecules.

What is the difference between evaporation and boiling?
-------------------------------------------------------

Evaporation is the phase change of a liquid to the gas state. Evaporation is one of the two types of vaporization. The other form of vaporization is boiling. Evaporation occurs only on the surface of the liquid.

Which is reversible process, evaporation or condensation?
---------------------------------------------------------

Thus, molecules at surface level move or vibrate with a strong force that they move out into the air and become vapor. This is called evaporation. At the same time, the process is reversible and molecules can join back to form liquids. This is known as condensation.
