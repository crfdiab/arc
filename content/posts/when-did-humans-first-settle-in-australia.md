When did humans first settle in Australia?
------------------------------------------

48,000 years ago  
The minimum widely accepted time frame for the arrival of humans in Australia is placed at least 48,000 years ago. Many sites dating from this time period have been excavated. In Arnhem Land the Malakunanja II rock shelter has been dated to around 65,000 years old.

Where did the first Australians originally live?
------------------------------------------------

Aboriginal origins Humans are thought to have migrated to Northern Australia from Asia using primitive boats. A current theory holds that those early migrants themselves came out of Africa about 70,000 years ago, which would make Aboriginal Australians the oldest population of humans living outside Africa.

Where were the first humans settled?
------------------------------------

By about 14,000 years ago, the first settlements built with stone began to appear, in modern-day Israel and Jordan. The inhabitants, sedentary hunter-gatherers called Natufians, buried their dead in or under their houses, just as Neolithic peoples did after them.

Where did the first people settle in Australia?
-----------------------------------------------

The new models suggest that the first people may have first landed in the Kimberley region in what is now Western Australia about 60,000 years ago, and had settled across the continent within 6,000 years.

When did the first humans come to Australia?
--------------------------------------------

They reached the Australian continent in canoes sometime between 35,000 and 65,000 years ago. Scientists studying land masses and climate know that the Pleistocene Ice Age created a land bridge that connected Asia and North America (Alaska) over 13,000 years ago.

Where was the first convict settlement in Australia?
----------------------------------------------------

The First Fleet of 11 ships, commanded by Captain Arthur Phillip, set up a convict settlement at Sydney Cove (now Circular Quay) on 26 January 1788. This was the beginning of convict settlement in Australia. Who was Australiaâ€™s first governor?

Where was the oldest human remains found in Australia?
------------------------------------------------------

The oldest human remains in Australia were found at Lake Mungo in south-west New South Wales. This site was occupied from 45,000 to 20,000 years ago when it was part of the Willandra Lakes system. Lake Mungo has been devoid of water for the last 16,000 years and is now a desert.
