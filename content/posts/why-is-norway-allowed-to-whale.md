Why is Norway allowed to whale?
-------------------------------

Norway hunts minke whales under an ‘objection’ to the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) global ban on commercial whaling, which came into effect in 1986. Initially, the hunts were undertaken under the guise of ‘science’ but in 1993, Norway resumed full-blown commercial whaling, citing this ‘objection’.

Does Norway support whaling?
----------------------------

Norway remains one of only three countries to publicly allow commercial whaling, along with Japan and Iceland.

Why was whaling important?
--------------------------

Meat, skin, blubber, and organs were eaten as an important source of protein, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Baleen was woven into baskets and used as fishing line. Whale oil comes from the blubber of right and bowhead whales, and the head cavity of sperm whales. It was used primarily for oil lamps.

What type of whale is eaten in Norway?
--------------------------------------

minke whales  
Whaling in Norway involves hunting of minke whales for use as animal and human food in Norway and for export to Japan. Whale hunting has been a part of Norwegian coastal culture for centuries, and commercial operations targeting the minke whale have occurred since the early 20th century.

Can you eat whale meat in Norway?
---------------------------------

Regions. In places such as Norway, Iceland, and Alaska, whale meat may be served without seasoning. However, it can also be cured or marinated, or made into jerky.

How is whaling done?
--------------------

The nations that have “scientific whaling” programs—Iceland and Japan—also support the use of explosive grenade harpoons. Traditional whalers in the United States use hand-held harpoons to ensnare whales, and then kill them with high-powered rifles. They have also used penthrite bombs and black powder.

Why does Norway want to carry out whaling?
------------------------------------------

Norway tries to claim that its whaling is ‘sustainable’ and must be carried out because ‘whales eat too many fish’.

How are women affected by the Norwegian whale hunt?
---------------------------------------------------

The impact of Norway’s hunt is not limited to the number of whales killed: On average, 68 percent of whales taken in Norway’s hunt are female, and 42.5 percent of those are pregnant. Norway’s whaling also has serious repercussions for animal welfare.

When did the Norwegian government stop killing whales?
------------------------------------------------------

In 1993, however, it announced that it would resume commercial whaling under its objection. It has continued to whale for commercial purposes since that time, killing many hundreds of minke whales every year, almost exclusively for its domestic market. Since 1993, Norway has killed more than 12,000 minke whales.

What did the Vikings do with the whales?
----------------------------------------

Vikings from Norway also introduced whaling methods for driving small cetaceans, like pilot whales, into fjords in Iceland. The Norse sagas, and other ancient documents, provide few details on Norwegian whaling. The sagas recount some disputes between families over whale carcasses but do not describe any organized whale fishery in Norway.
