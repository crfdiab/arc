Where does Santa Claus actually live?
-------------------------------------

While some believe Santa’s residence to be the North Pole, others say his residence is in Korvatunturi in Lapland. It’s long been imagined Santa and Mrs Claus share a home here, and Santa has his workshop in the same location where his elves make all of the Christmas toys.

Why do they say Santa lives in the North Pole?
----------------------------------------------

Nicholas’s migration to the North Pole is due most directly to Thomas Nast, an American cartoonist who submitted 33 Christmas drawings to Harper’s Weekly magazine between 1863 and 1886, one of which featured a village called “Santa Claussville, N.P.” N.P., as you may have guessed, stands for the North Pole.

Can you visit Santa at the North Pole?

Where does Santa Claus live in North Pole?
------------------------------------------

In North America, it is believed that Santa Claus lives in the North Pole. This is not a new idea, and can be traced back to 1869, when George P. Webster wrote a poem about Santa. In the poem, he writes that Santa’s home is ‘near the North Pole’. There is also a city named ‘North Pole’ which can be found in Alaska,…

Why was there no one at the North Pole?
---------------------------------------

No one had seen the North Pole. No one knew what was happening there. It was mysterious and just out of reach. It made the perfect location for Santa’s home and his bustling workshop. P.S. Nast is also responsible for the physical appearance of Santa that we have grown to love.

Where does the story of Santa Claus come from?
----------------------------------------------

The figure of Santa Claus is based on Saint Nicholas of Myra, who lived in a Roman town located in what’s now Turkey. So how did his headquarters end up all the way at the North Pole? We can thank cartoonist Thomas Nast for that.

Is it true that Santa Claus is real?
------------------------------------

The short answer, in every way that matters, is YES, Santa Claus is real! Not only is Santa true, he is legendary! And if you still don’t believe me, here are NINE proofs to prove that point like the point on my pointy shoes! Mrs. Claus would be mad! If you can feel him, then he must be real.
