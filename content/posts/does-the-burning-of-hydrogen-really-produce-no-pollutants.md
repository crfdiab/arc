Does the burning of hydrogen really produce no pollutants?
----------------------------------------------------------

“Unlike fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming carbon dioxide when they’re burned, hydrogen mostly produces water.” Answer: false. This is because combustion is where hydrogen goes from “emissions-free” to polluting, the critical distinction seemingly lost in this new debate about using H2 to address climate change.

Does burning hydrogen affect the environment?
---------------------------------------------

Emissions of hydrogen lead to increased burdens of methane and ozone and hence to an increase in global warming. Therefore, hydrogen can be considered as an indirect greenhouse gas with the potential to increase global warming.

Does hydrogen cause atmospheric pollution?
------------------------------------------

Public Health and Environment Emissions from gasoline and diesel vehicles—such as nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter—are a major source of this pollution. Hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles emit none of these harmful substances—only water (H2O) and warm air.

How does hydrogen affect the atmosphere?
----------------------------------------

Its by-product is CO2, which is a greenhouse gas and its emission results in global warming and climate change. Therefore, hydrogen generated from fossil fuels is contributing to global warming to the similar extent as direct combustion of the fossil fuels.

What does burning hydrogen release?
-----------------------------------

In a flame of pure hydrogen gas, burning in air, the hydrogen (H2) reacts with oxygen (O2) to form water (H2O) and releases energy. If carried out in atmospheric air instead of pure oxygen, as is usually the case, hydrogen combustion may yield small amounts of nitrogen oxides, along with the water vapor.

Does soot contribute to global warming?
---------------------------------------

Soot particles influence global warming more than previously assumed. In the atmosphere or as deposits on snow and ice surfaces, soot particles absorb the short-wave radiation of the sun and thus contribute to global warming.

Which is worse for the atmosphere hydrogen or petroleum?
--------------------------------------------------------

Joseph Romm, a physicist, author of, among other books, Hell and High Water: Global Warming–the Solution and the Politics–or Hydrogen and editor of the respected ClimateProgress, also points out that the gas can be worse for the atmosphere than regular gas, depending on the circumstances.

How does producing hydrogen from methane affect the atmosphere?
---------------------------------------------------------------

As with coal, producing hydrogen from methane yields abundant carbon monoxide that upon combustion becomes carbon dioxide. But the news isn’t all bad. For the same energy delivered, producing hydrogen from methane dumps about half as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as burning fossil fuels does.

Why do natural gas flares pollute the air?
------------------------------------------

It is common to flare natural gas that contains hydrogen sulfide (i.e., sour gas), in order to convert the highly toxic hydrogen sulfide gas into less toxic compounds. Flares emit a host of air pollutants, depending on the chemical composition of the gas being burned and the efficiency and temperature of the flare.

How is hydrogen fuel bad for the environment?
---------------------------------------------

Politicians will choose to dump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and pay the hidden price of pollution, rather than ask the public to pay an up-front price at the pump. Still, hydrogen is far from an ideal automobile fuel. Even in its densest form (liquid), hydrogen has only one-third as much energy per liter as gasoline.
