How does human activity affect the savanna?
-------------------------------------------

Humans impact the Grassland Savanna by lessening the area of the land by making new space for industrialization. The trees and animals have less space to be so the population decreases with the land, making everything smaller.

How do people affect savanna grasslands?
----------------------------------------

This threat to a savanna ecosystem include effects caused by climate change, farming practices, overgrazing, aggressive agricultural irrigation, which lowers the level of the water table away from plant roots, deforestation and erosion.

How are humans impacting the Savanna biome?
-------------------------------------------

Humans have a relatively negative impact on the savanna biome through desertification and tourism. However, the increased tourism has had some positive impacts, such as increased conservation efforts, according to the BBC. Desertification means that the land is increasingly dry, losing much of its plant life and water.

How does overburning affect the African savannah ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------------------------

However, overburning by humans to reduce bush encroachment and natural re-recruitment of trees leads the ecosystem to be more vulnerable to invasion by foreign species, which further transforms and upsets the balance of the land.

What are the threats to the African savannah?
---------------------------------------------

In fact, livestock is one of the biggest threats to the African savannah because if just three families try to live on the same plot of land, it can immediately become overgrazed. In addition, humans have further damaged the ecosystem by hunting many species of animals to the brink of extinction or critical endangerment.

How did the Aboriginal people change the savanna?
-------------------------------------------------

The Aboriginal people would sometimes purposely start fires to stop some Savannas becoming forest areas. When these burnings were stopped many savannas changed to areas of forest or very thick shrub. Humans also clear trees from Savannas to make them better for pasture production.
