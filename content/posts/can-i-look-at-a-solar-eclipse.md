Can I look at a solar eclipse?
------------------------------

It is never safe to look directly at the sun’s rays – even if the sun is partly obscured. When watching a partial eclipse you must wear eclipse glasses at all times if you want to face the sun, or use an alternate indirect method.

What is eclipse of the sun and moon?
------------------------------------

Sometimes when the Moon orbits Earth, the Moon moves between the Sun and Earth. When this happens, the Moon blocks the light of the Sun from reaching Earth. This causes an eclipse of the Sun, or a solar eclipse. During a solar eclipse, the Moon casts a shadow onto Earth.

Is a solar eclipse dangerous?
-----------------------------

It is possible to suffer serious and permanent eye damage by looking at any type of solar eclipse and there is no treatment. Children are especially at risk due to more light reaching the retina than adults.

Why is it dangerous to look at an eclipse?
------------------------------------------

The sun damages the retina, which is the part of your eye that transmits information to the brain. Long exposure to the sun without proper protection will cause scarring of the retina from burns and lead to partial, or even permanent, blindness. Those who want to look with their own eyes must wear eclipse glasses.

Is it possible to see an eclipse of the Sun and Moon?
-----------------------------------------------------

As a result, during most months, the Moon is sufficiently above or below the ecliptic plane to avoid an eclipse. But when the two paths cross (twice a year), it is then “eclipse season” and eclipses are possible. The apparent or angular sizes of both the Sun and Moon vary slightly from time to time as their distances from Earth vary.

What is the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

lunar eclipse: an eclipse of the Moon, in which the Moon moves into the shadow of Earth; lunar eclipses can occur only at the time of full moon. solar eclipse: an eclipse of the Sun by the Moon, caused by the passage of the Moon in front of the Sun; solar eclipses can occur only at the time of the new moon.

Can you see the lunar eclipse from Hamilton?
--------------------------------------------

During this partial lunar eclipse, the Earth’s shadow covers only parts of the Moon, as seen from Hamilton. There are no other locations on Earth where the Moon appears completely covered during this event.

Why is it hard to see a penumbral lunar eclipse?
------------------------------------------------

The curvature of the shadow’s path and the apparent rotation of the Moon’s disk is due to the Earth’s rotation. A penumbral lunar eclipse can be a bit hard to see as the shadowed part is only a little bit fainter than the rest of the Moon.
