What is Pacific seismic belt?
-----------------------------

The world’s greatest earthquake belt, the circum-Pacific seismic belt, is found along the rim of the Pacific Ocean, where about 81 percent of our planet’s largest earthquakes occur. Earthquakes in these subduction zones are caused by slip between plates and rupture within plates.

Which seismic belt can we found the most active volcanoes and earthquake origin?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pacific Ring of Fire  
The Ring of Fire (also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Rim of Fire, the Girdle of Fire or the Circum-Pacific belt) is a region around much of the rim of the Pacific Ocean where many volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.

What type of plate boundary creates the belt of volcanoes that encircles the Pacific Ocean?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries are found all along the Pacific Ocean basin, primarily at the edges of the Pacific, Cocos, and Nazca plates. Trenches mark subduction zones. The Cascades are a chain of volcanoes at a convergent boundary where an oceanic plate is subducting beneath a continental plate.

What are three major seismic belts?
-----------------------------------

There are three main seismic belts: the Circum-Pacific seismic belt (“Ring of Fire”), Alpide belt, and the Oceanic Ridge belt. Most major tectonic earthquakes occur in the Circum-Pacific seismic belt (USGS).

What is the distinguishing features of the major earthquake belt Circum-Pacific Belt?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The edges where these plates move against one another are the location of interplate earthquakes that produce the seismic belts. Island arcs, mountain chains, volcanism, deep ocean troughs, and oceanic ridges are often features of seismic belts.

Which is the most active volcano in the Pacific Ring of fire?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand is one of the more active volcanoes in the Ring of Fire, with yearly minor eruptions, and major eruptions occurring about every 50 years. It stands 2,797 meters (9,177 feet) high. Mount Ruapehu is part of the Taupo Volcanic Arc, where the dense Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Australian Plate.

Is the ring of fire in the Pacific Ocean?
-----------------------------------------

The Ring of Fire (also known as the Rim of Fire or the Circum-Pacific belt) is a major area in the basin of the Pacific Ocean where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur.

How is the ring of fire a result of plate tectonics?
----------------------------------------------------

The Ring of Fire is largely a result of plate tectonics, where the massive Pacific Plate interacts with less-dense plates surrounding it. Click below to visit our MapMaker Interactive map of tectonic activity in the Ring of Fire.

Is the Aleutian Trench parallel to the Pacific Plate?
-----------------------------------------------------

The Aleutian Islands in the U.S. state of Alaska, for example, run parallel to the Aleutian Trench. Both geographic features continue to form as the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate. The Aleutian Trench reaches a maximum depth of 7,679 meters (25,194 feet).
