Hear this out loudPauseTornadoes are very destructive. The average width of a tornado is 300 to 500 yards. Their path may extend up to fifty miles, and the funnel cloud moves at speeds between 10 and 50 mph. The wind speed within the funnel cloud has been estimated at between 100 and 500 mph.

What is the range of a tornado’s diameter?
------------------------------------------

between 50 and 1,000 m  
Hear this out loudPauseThe diameter of a tornado is between 50 and 1,000 m (average ~ 100 m); the wind speed according to the Enhanced Fujita scale (EF) is more than 105 km/h (EF0, see Table 1).

How big is the path of a tornado?
---------------------------------

Tornado paths range from 100 yards to one mile wide and are rarely more than 15 miles long, although some strong tornadoes on record have crossed through multiple states (e.g. the Tri- State Tornado of 1925. They can last from several seconds to more than an hour, however, most don’t exceed 10 minutes.

What’s the average length of time for a tornado?
------------------------------------------------

29% of all tornadoes are labeled “strong tornadoes” meaning they last 20 minutes or longer and winds reach 110-205 mph. 2% of all tornadoes are labeled “violent tornadoes” and can last over an hour. Every state has had a tornado, but some states are more prone to them.

How big is the average size of a thunderstorm?
----------------------------------------------

15-mile diameter, average. Ranges from 10 yeards to 2.6 miles wide (50 yards, average) Ranges from 100 to 900 miles in diameter. (300 miles diameter, average) Storm strength. Severe or non-severe. Severe storms have one or more of the following conditions: Winds of 58+ mph.

How many deaths can be caused by a tornado?
-------------------------------------------

This type of tornado causes 30% of all deaths from tornadoes. Wind speeds for strong tornadoes are between 110-205 mph (177-330 kph). These tornadoes can last 20 minutes or even longer. Demolished mobile homes and overturned trains are part of the damage that could happen from a strong tornado.
