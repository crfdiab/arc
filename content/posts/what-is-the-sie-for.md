What is the SIE for?
--------------------

The SIE Exam is a required qualifications exam administered by FINRA. It tests basic information including products, risks, the structure &amp; function of the securities industry &amp; its regulatory agencies, and knowledge of regulated &amp; prohibited practices.

How long does the SIE last?
---------------------------

four years  
The SIE will be valid for four years from the date that you pass the exam. This means that if you become employed by a broker-dealer during the four-year period and need to become registered as a general securities representative, you will not need to take the SIE again.

What is the difference between SIE and Series 7?
------------------------------------------------

For example, while both cover options strategies and calculations, the SIE focuses more on basic options positions, such as single positions and hedging strategies, whereas the Series 7 Top-Off goes a step further and tests on advanced positions, such as spreads and straddles.

How difficult is the SIE?
-------------------------

You need to get a score of 70%, or higher, to pass. During your SIE exam prep, be honest with yourself about how much knowledge you have going in. If you have a hard time defining a “stock” or “bond” for example, then you should expect to take about two months to study on average.

Is series 6 or 7 better?
------------------------

After passing the Series 6 Exam, you’re able to sell mutual funds, variable annuities, and other variable products on behalf of a company. Typically, the Series 7 is the better choice if you’re interested in selling individual securities either now or in the future.

Should I take Sie before Series 7?
----------------------------------

SIE is a co-requisite for the Series 6 and Series 7 exams and can be taken any time before or after the Top-Off exams (within 4 years). We recommend, however, that you pass your SIE exam first and then prepare for Series 6 or 7 Top-Off.

Whether it’s from a guy you have zero interest in or from your ex who doesn’t understand that your relationship is WAY over, checking your phone for a notification only to see that your message reads “hey u” is a disappointment no matter the sender.

What does a ” hi ” or ” Hey ” text mean?
----------------------------------------

A casual “hi,” “hey,” or “hello” seems so simple, but it can actually mean a lot. First, the fact that your crush went out of their way to send you a greeting means they were obviously thinking about you. You don’t just send someone a “hi” text just for the heck of it.
