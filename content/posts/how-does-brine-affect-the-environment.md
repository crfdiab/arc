How does brine affect the environment?
--------------------------------------

Environmental Impacts of Brine (Produced Water) (R1850, June 2017) Brine, or produced water, is a byproduct of oil and gas production. Brine has a high salt concentration the ions of the salts negatively affect the site’s soil and vegetation, impairing its ability to produce crops and forage.

How does desalination impact society?
-------------------------------------

The desalination process involves taking seawater and forcing it through reverse osmosis membranes to clean it (Figure 1 and 3). This process can negatively impact community land use, increase erosion, cause visual and acoustic disturbances, and spread emissions into the water and atmosphere.

What is the problem with brine?
-------------------------------

The brine poses major risks to ocean life and marine ecosystems by greatly raising the salinity of the seawater it flows into, and by polluting oceans with toxic chemicals used as anti-scalants and anti-foulants, including copper and chlorine.

How does brine discharge affect marine life?
--------------------------------------------

Impact of discharge brine The impacts on marine life are primarily due to almost doubling the salt concentration and the total alkalinity. The heavily concentrated brine solution discharged into the sea from the desalination plant has the potential to kill marine organisms and cause damage to the marine population.

Will rain wash away brine?
--------------------------

If rain is expected before the snow or ice moves in, it would wash away the brine, so there’s no sense in applying it, Kole says. If the temperature is below 20 degrees, the brine would freeze.

Is brine dangerous to humans?
-----------------------------

Formed when ancient salt deposits leach into the ocean, brine pools are so dense it is difficult to penetrate their surface—and their high salinity, often combined with heavy concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and methane gases, makes them lethal to most creatures that try.

What are the 3 main problems associated with desalination?
----------------------------------------------------------

The disadvantages of desalination are causing many people to think twice before starting desalination projects.

- Waste Disposal. As with any process, desalination has by-products that must be taken care of.
- Brine Production. Brine is the side product of desalination.
- Ocean Populations.
- Health Concerns.
- Energy Use.

How does desalination impact the economy?
-----------------------------------------

Desalination and energy use Desalination requires significantly more energy than existing conventional water treatment processes. This makes it expensive and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. This can result in a significant increase in operating costs, due to the premium attached to the use of renewable energy.

Is brine toxic?
---------------

The authors cite major risks to ocean life and marine ecosystems posed by brine greatly raising the salinity of the receiving seawater, and by polluting the oceans with toxic chemicals used as anti-scalants and anti-foulants in the desalination process (copper and chlorine are of major concern).

What do you do with brine?
--------------------------

It’s also a good idea to brine meats like chicken and pork before smoking on the barbecue, as they can end up dry after being exposed to so much smoke. But brining can be used to impart flavours and season pretty much any meat, poultry, fish and seafood.

At what temperature does brine not work?
----------------------------------------

But, the salt is in a solution in the water, and that solution has a lower freezing point than pure water, as noted earlier. In particular, when salt brine is applied at a 23.3% concentration, it will freeze (without any additional dilution) at about -6° F.

Does rain wash away rock salt?
------------------------------

The salt works by lowering the freezing temperature of water, which causes ice to melt and thus reduces injuries from slipping. Applying rock salt while it is still raining prevents the water from freezing to begin with.

What was the rise and fall of Turkey brining?
---------------------------------------------

The Rise and Fall of Turkey Brining. After two decades of flying high, the wet-brined bird has lost altitude with many of the food-media influencers who sent it soaring.

How did the British affect the indigenous peoples of Australia?
---------------------------------------------------------------

For instance, Sydney was originally home to the Eora people. Not only did the British confiscate lands, but they also used up many of the natural resources that sustained the natives. The British brought in sheep and cattle, driving away native wildlife and using Aboriginal land for grazing lands.

What was done about the Stolen Generation in Australia?
-------------------------------------------------------

What has been done about this? In 1995, the Australian government launched an inquiry into the policy of forced child removal. The report was delivered to Parliament on the 26th May 1997. It estimated that between 10 per cent and 33 per cent of all Indigenous children were separated from their families between 1910-1970.

How can Australia make amends for past injustices?
--------------------------------------------------

It is only through understanding and accepting the wrongs of the past, and the often intergenerational impacts of these wrongs, that Australia can make adequate amends for the injustices faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples since European colonisation and ensure that they are never repeated.
