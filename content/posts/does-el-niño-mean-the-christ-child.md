Does El Niño mean the Christ child?
-----------------------------------

Little Boy  
El Niño means Little Boy, or Christ Child in Spanish. South American fishermen first noticed periods of unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean in the 1600s. During normal conditions, upwelling brings water from the depths to the surface; this water is cold and nutrient rich.

Which weather phenomena is known as the Christ child?
-----------------------------------------------------

When capitalized, El Niño means the Christ Child, and was used because the phenomenon often arrived around Christmas. El Niño soon came to describe irregular and intense climate changes rather than just the warming of coastal surface waters.

What is the difference between El Niño and La Niña?
---------------------------------------------------

El Niño refers to the above-average sea-surface temperatures that periodically develop across the east-central equatorial Pacific. It represents the warm phase of the ENSO cycle. La Niña refers to the periodic cooling of sea-surface temperatures across the east-central equatorial Pacific.

Why is El Nino called the Christ Child?
---------------------------------------

The fishermen call this condition of warm coastal waters and poor fishing “El Niño” meaning “the Christ Child,” because in the occasional years it comes, it comes at Christmas time. In El Niño years, lots of rain clouds forms over this warm part of the ocean.

What kind of weather does El Nino cause?
----------------------------------------

El Niño is a weather pattern. In El Niño years, ocean waters along South America and California warm above normal temperatures. Many rain clouds form over this warm part of the ocean and move inland, dumping more rain than usual in South and Central America and in the United States. What is El Niño anyway?

What happens during the transition period of El Nino?
-----------------------------------------------------

The transition period of an El Niño event, for instance, is called a “Trans Niño.”. Trans Niño events occur at the onset and closing of an El Niño event. Trans Niño events often include increased tornado activity in the American Midwest. Another “flavor” of El Niño is the El Niño Modoki, or Modoki Niño.

What happens to the trade winds during El Nino?
-----------------------------------------------

El Nino. During El Nino, trade winds weaken. Warm water is pushed back east, toward the west coast of the Americas. El Nino means Little Boy, or Christ Child in Spanish. South American fishermen first noticed periods of unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean in the 1600s.
