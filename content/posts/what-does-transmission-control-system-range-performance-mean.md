What does transmission control system Range Performance mean?
-------------------------------------------------------------

OBD-II Code P0701 is defined as a Transmission Control System Range/Performance. The automatic transmission matches the engine optimum power and torque characteristics to the driver’s desired rate of acceleration and speed by auto-selecting different gear ratios or ‘speeds’ to power the wheels.

What is the code P0700?
-----------------------

P0700: Transmission Control System Malfunction. The OBD-II scanner error code P0700 problem is a generic code that applies to vehicles equipped with OBD-II. It refers to the transmission control module (TCM) in the automatic transmission. You may be seeing poor gas mileage or have transmission shifting problems.

What is a transmission module?
------------------------------

A transmission control module is an electronic mechanism that collects data and processes signals within your transmission in order to regulate the transmission’s gear shifting. Without this mechanism, your transmission wouldn’t be able to shift gears effectively and consistently.

What does trouble code po700 mean?
----------------------------------

transmission control system  
P0700 is set when the PCM detects a malfunction in the transmission control system. This malfunction causes the vehicle to set a Check Engine Light and trigger a failsafe mode. Once the failsafe mode is set it will remain until the fault is repaired or normal operation is detected.

How do I fix system Too Lean Bank 1 and 2?
------------------------------------------

What repairs can fix the P0171 code?

1. Replacing the fuel pump.
2. Replacing the fuel filter.
3. Replacing the fuel pressure regulator.
4. Replacing the powertrain control module.
5. Replacing one or more injectors.
6. Replacing one or more oxygen sensors.
7. Replacing the mass air flow sensor.
8. Repairing a vacuum leak.

What can cause a P0741 code?
----------------------------

What causes the P0741 code?

- Faulty TCC.
- Faulty torque converter lockup solenoid.
- Internal short in the TCC solenoid.
- Wiring to the TCC solenoid that is damaged.
- Faulty valve body.
- Faulty Transmission Control Module (TCM)
- Faulty Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor.
- Damage of the wiring harness to the transmission.

Is it safe to drive with a P0700 code?
--------------------------------------

How Serious Is P0700? – Severe. The vehicle should avoid being driven when presenting with the trouble code P0700. It could get caught in one gear and cause not only a safety hazard for you, but for those around you as well.

How much does it cost to fix P0700 code?
----------------------------------------

How much does it cost to resolve the P0700 code? Depending on the root of the problem triggering a P0700 code, repair costs can differ significantly. For instance, if a faulty transmission control module causes the problem, repair costs can range from $840 to $900.

How can you tell if your transmission control module is bad?
------------------------------------------------------------

Signs of a Bad Transmission Control Module

1. Unpredictable shifting.
2. Trouble shifting into higher gear.
3. Trouble downshifting.
4. Getting stuck in the same gear.
5. Poor fuel economy.
6. Check engine light comes on.

How do you reset Transmission Control Module?
---------------------------------------------

Steps to Resetting Transmission Control Module

1. Step 1: Turning Key Position. Before resetting the transmission control module, it is necessary to check the key position.
2. Step 2: Press gas pedal.
3. Step 3: Keep Waiting.
4. Step 4: Turning the Key Off.
5. Step 5: Releasing Gas Pedal.
6. Step 6: Wait Again.
7. Step 7: Ready.

How much does it cost to fix a system too lean Bank 1?
------------------------------------------------------

Perhaps your P0171 OBD-II Trouble Code: System Too Lean Bank 1 trouble code is appearing because it is due to you needing to replace your fuel injector/injectors. Generally, a fuel injector replacement cost will between $800 and $1,450 for a full replacement.

What causes the p0701 OBD-II trouble code?
------------------------------------------

When a P0701 trouble code is stored, the transmission control system has detected an abnormality in the readings from one or more sensors. This code can also derive from a malfunction with a solenoid or switch, or any malfunction with a specific transmission component or the transmission system itself. What causes the P0701 code?

What does it mean when your transmission code is p0702?
-------------------------------------------------------

The storage of a P0702 trouble code is an indicator of more specific transmission problem and usually precedes the storage of a more specific transmission-related trouble code. This code is specific to vehicles with an automatic transmission, and if found on a vehicle with a manual transmission, it indicates a faulty PCM.

What does Mil code p0701 stand for?
-----------------------------------

Although generic, the specific repair steps may vary depending on make/model. If your vehicle instrument panel has presented an illuminated malfunction indicator lamp (MIL), accompanied by a stored code P0701, it simply means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a malfunction in the transmission control system.

Where can I find the DTC p0701 code?
------------------------------------

If the ECM shows DTC P0701 stored, look for other TCM-related codes to aid in your diagnosis. You may find: P0701 is a generic code indicating there are other transmission DTCs active. I suggest you repost this in either Domestics or Transmissions and include all the pertinent info, including year, make, model, FWD or AWD, A/T or CVT, etc….
