What factor do you think accelerated the process of globalization?
------------------------------------------------------------------

The world economy has become increasingly interdependent for a long time. However, in recent decades the process of globalisation has accelerated; this is due to a variety of factors, but important ones include improved trade, increased labour and capital mobility and improved technology.

Why did Japan develop so fast?
------------------------------

A number of factors contributed to Japan’s rapid economic growth, including its starting point. World War II ruined Japan’s economy, killing millions of its people and destroying about 40 percent of its capital stock. Groups need time to reorganize and begin to seek privileges, and meanwhile, the economy grows faster.

How did Taiwan develop so quickly?
----------------------------------

According to economist Paul Krugman, the rapid growth was made possible by increases in capital and labor but not an increase in efficiency. In other words, the savings rate increased and work hours were lengthened, and many more people, such as women, entered the work force.

What factors cause globalization?
---------------------------------

Broadly speaking, economic, financial, political, technological and social factors have paved the way to globalization. Economic factors mainly include lower trade and investment barriers. Expansion of financial sector is also considered an important force of glo- balization.

Why are Japanese so rich?
-------------------------

Why is Japan so rich ?? Japan has close economic ties with the United States, European Union, Latin America, Australia, China and many others. The country has developed one of the world’s most powerful economies based entirely on imported raw materials.

Why is Japan so clean?
----------------------

The answer is complicated but could be attributed in part to two things: national pride, and peer pressure. It’s important to the Japanese government that their cities are seen as immaculately clean, which is why most of the busy, tourist-filled areas are kept that way.

Why is South Korea considered an economic tiger?
------------------------------------------------

The primary reason for the rise of the economies of the Four Asian Tigers was their export policies. Whereas, Taiwan and South Korea adopted hybrid regimes that suited their export businesses. Because of limited domestic markets in Singapore and Hong Kong, domestic and foreign prices were linked.

What did the US trade with China in the 1800s?
----------------------------------------------

Chinese demand for the root dropped, and so did its price. But the Chinese did want sea-otter pelts, which Yankees traded from Indians in the American Northwest. Sandalwood, found in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), also brought a high price from Chinese merchants. The trade took an ugly turn in the early 1800s.

How did trade affect US foreign policy in the late 1800s?
---------------------------------------------------------

Events in another group of Pacific Ocean islands affected American foreign policy in the late 1800s. These were the Hawaiian islands. Hawaii was an important port for American trade ships sailing between the United States and China. Good relations between Hawaii and the United States were necessary to keep the port open to American ships.

How did Asian Americans come to the United States?
--------------------------------------------------

Long before Asian Americans settled in the United States in significant numbers, images of Asia and Asians had already taken root in American popular culture and consciousness, thanks to the influence of Indian and Chinese trade in the late 1700’s and later at the turn-of-the-century with the forced annexation of the Philippines in 1898.

What was trade with Asia in the 1500’s?
---------------------------------------

During the period 1500-1800 Asian commodities flooded into the West. As well as spices and tea, they included silks, cottons, porcelains and other luxury goods.
