How does a spaceship stay on the Moon?
--------------------------------------

The LM would control its descent by firing its thrust against the moon’s gravity to slow the fall. Upon making a vertical landing, the LM would power down for the lunar stay. When ready to leave, the bottom portion of the LM would remain on the surface of the moon and act as a launch pad.

How do you get back to the Moon from Earth?
-------------------------------------------

A cislunar free-return trajectory. The spacecraft goes beyond the orbit of the Moon, returns to inside the Moon’s orbit, moves in front of the Moon while being diverted by the Moon’s gravity to a path away from the Earth to beyond the orbit of the Moon again, and is drawn back to Earth by Earth’s gravity.

How does a rocket fly to the Moon?
----------------------------------

With Project Constellation, the plan is to have the rocket carrying the crew and its command capsule dock in low Earth orbit with the departure stage and lunar lander brought up by the cargo rocket. The departure stage would then fire its thrusters and send the spacecraft to the moon.

How do space shuttles get back to Earth?
----------------------------------------

Once the orbiter is tail first, the crew fires the OMS engines to slow the orbiter down and fall back to Earth; it will take about 25 minutes before the shuttle reaches the upper atmosphere. …

How does a rocket get to the Moon?
----------------------------------

Getting to the Moon requires a powerful rocket ship to accelerate a spacecraft fast enough to overcome the pull of Earth’s gravity and set it on a precise trajectory to its destination.

How did the astronauts land on the Moon?
----------------------------------------

The way the astronauts landed on and then left the moon is as follows. The entire spacecraft was fit into the top of a Saturn V rocket which took off from the Earth’s surface. While climbing into space, the rocket would fall apart in stages until only the spacecraft remained.

Why does the SLS rocket go to the Moon?
---------------------------------------

SLS uses its power to maximize the cargo the rocket can send to the Moon. That’s why SLS does not carry extra fuel or propulsion systems necessary to return any stages to Earth for reuse. The solid rocket boosters separate two minutes into the flight, and the core stage falls away around eight minutes after launch.

How did they get back to Earth from the Moon?
---------------------------------------------

Head back to Earth. The main thruster on the Apollo and Constellation service modules is fired to escape the moon’s gravity, and the spacecraft is directed back to Earth. On entering Earth’s gravity, the service module thruster is pointed toward Earth and fired again to slow the command capsule down before being jettisoned. Go for a landing.
