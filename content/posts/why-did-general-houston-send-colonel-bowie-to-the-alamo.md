Why did General Houston send Colonel Bowie to the Alamo?
--------------------------------------------------------

On January 17, 1836, Sam Houston, the commander of the revolutionary troops, sent Colonel Jim Bowie and 25 men to San Antonio with orders to destroy the Alamo fortifications and retire eastward with the artillery. Bowie also had a keen eye for logistics, terrain, and avenues of assault.

When did Houston order the Alamo blown up?
------------------------------------------
