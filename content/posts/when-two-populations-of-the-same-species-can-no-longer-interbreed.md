When two populations of the same species can no longer interbreed?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Reproductive isolation occurs when a population splits into two groups and the two populations no longer interbreed. When populations become reproductively isolated, they can evolve into two separate species.

When two populations can no longer mate and produce offspring?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Speciation is the separation of two previously interbreeding populations into two populations that can no longer mate to produce fertile, viable offpring.

What is it called when two populations can no longer interbreed and the gene pool is now different?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In speciation, an ancestral species splits into two or more descendant species that are genetically different from one another and can no longer interbreed. Darwin envisioned speciation as a branching event.

When animals from two populations can interbreed to produce fertile offspring it is evidence of what?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The generation of allopolyploidy: Alloploidy results when two species mate to produce viable offspring. In the example shown, a normal gamete from one species fuses with a polyploidy gamete from another.

How does the new species are produced due to variation?
-------------------------------------------------------

When variations occur within a species, they can only be passed to the next generation along two main pathways: asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction. The change will be passed on asexually simply if the reproducing cell possesses the changed trait.

What are at least 3 factors that can cause speciation \*?
---------------------------------------------------------

Factors that lead to speciation include genetic drift, natural selection, geographical isolation, mutation.

Which is an example of a mountain range?
----------------------------------------

Uplift and formation of a mountain range divide a freshwater snail species into two isolated populations. Erosion eventually lowers the mountain range and brings the two populations together again, but when they mate, the resulting hybrids all produce sterile young. This scenario is an example of

When do reproductive barriers form between two populations?
-----------------------------------------------------------

C) formation of a reproductive barrier between two populations is more likely if they experience and adapt to different environmental conditions. D) reproductive barriers usually are absolute: Either two populations are fully willing and able to interbreed, or they are strictly separated by a fully effective reproductive barrier.

What happens when two species interbreed and breed?
---------------------------------------------------

Two species interbreed occasionally and produce vigorous, fertile hybrids. When the hybrids breed with each other or with either parent species, however, the offspring are feeble or sterile. These species are affected by A) gametic isolation. B) reduced hybrid fertility. C) reduced hybrid viability.

What do you call speciation without geographic isolation?
---------------------------------------------------------

Speciation without geographic isolation is called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ speciation. A) haploid. B) polyploid. C) diploid. D) hybrids. A) a single diploid parent plant. B) a single triploid parent plant. C) a single tetraploid parent plant. D) the hybridization of two parent species. A) pentaploid and sterile. B) diploid and fertile. C) triploid and fertile.
