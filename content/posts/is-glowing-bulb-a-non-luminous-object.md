What is an example of a non-luminous object?
--------------------------------------------

Non-luminous objects are the objects that do not have their own source of light energy and hence they cannot emit light and are not responsible for vision. These objects can only be visible due to luminous objects. Examples of non-luminous objects are the moon, plants, and spoons.

The luminous flux indicates how much light is emitted by a light source. This refers to all visible light emitted by the LED lamp in all directions. The physical unit for the luminous flux is called lumen and is abbreviated to lm. It is important to see the lumen value in conjunction with the beam angle of the lamp.

Is Moon a non-luminous object?
