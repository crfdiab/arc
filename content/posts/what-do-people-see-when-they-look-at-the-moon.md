What do people see when they look at the Moon?
----------------------------------------------

There was no pattern to these eruptions, but as people see figures in natural phenomena like clouds and rock formations, so too have they seen figures in the Moon. Here are some of the most notable. The most famous of these lunar pareidolia (the name for seeing a pattern where there isn’t one) is the man in the moon.

Can a telescope on Earth see the Moon?
--------------------------------------

Update from Ann: It’s still the case that the relatively small telescopes we have on Earth, and orbiting Earth, can’t see these tiny features on the Moon.

Can you see the Earth from the lunar equator?
---------------------------------------------

Standing on the lunar equator, the Earth would shine near the zenith and cycle through phases the same way the Moon does on Earth, at the same time describing a small loop in the sky (more on this in a minute).

Why do we always see the same side of the Moon?
-----------------------------------------------

Because the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth — it revolves around our planet at the same rate that it rotates — we always see the same side. While the Moon’s gravity has acted as a brake on Earth’s rotation over time, our Earth still spins merrily away in the lunar sky every 24 hours.

Are there any strange things on the Moon?
-----------------------------------------

Strange things have been spotted on the moon for centuries — usually flashes of light or color, or lights that appear to move across the lunar surface. These are known as transient lunar phenomena (TLP), and many of the reports, dating from 1540 to 1969, have been cataloged by NASA and amateur astronomers.

Are there any artificial objects on the Moon?
---------------------------------------------

This is a partial list of artificial materials left on the Moon during the missions of the Apollo program.

When did they start seeing things on the Moon?
----------------------------------------------

These are known as transient lunar phenomena (TLP), and many of the reports, dating from 1540 to 1969, have been cataloged by NASA and amateur astronomers.
