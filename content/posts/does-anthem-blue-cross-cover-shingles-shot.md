Does Anthem Blue Cross cover shingles shot?
-------------------------------------------

Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield and HealthKeepers, Inc. are updating our Affordable Care Act (ACA) preventive care coverage to include Shingrix, the new zoster (shingles) vaccine, based on a new recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

Does VA pay for shingles vaccine?
---------------------------------

Veterans receive the shingles vaccine at no cost at VA medical centers, the agency said. Isenberg said he had been willing to fork over $167 for the first shot and was prepared to pay for the second because he knows it’s important. Still, the no-charge shot from the VA medical center was a relief.

Will my insurance cover Shingrix?
---------------------------------

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires all Health Insurance Marketplace plans and most other private health insurance plans to cover all ACIP-recommended vaccines, including SHINGRIX, with no cost sharing (deductibles, copayments or coinsurance) if administered in-network.

What happens if you don’t get second Shingrix shot?
---------------------------------------------------

If you received one dose of the Shingrix® vaccine but a shortage kept you from getting your second dose – a painful case of shingles still could be in your future. The makers of Shingrix claim its protection is sustained at a high level for at least four years – but only if you get both doses two to six months apart.

Is the second Shingrix shot as bad as the first?
------------------------------------------------

Dear J.G.: Compared with the previous one-time vaccine Zostavax, the new two-dose Shingrix vaccine is much more effective. However, it does have a higher risk of side effects. You have had the most common side effect, though only 10 percent of people will have symptoms as bad as yours.

Is Shingrix free for seniors?
-----------------------------

Anyone age 50 and older​ can now get immunized. The vaccine is not given as part of the routine Alberta immunization schedule. You have to pay for the vaccine as it’s not covered by Alberta Health Care.

Are both doses of Shingrix the same?
------------------------------------

You’ll receive two separate doses of the vaccine. After you receive the first dose, you can get the second dose two to six months later. A healthcare provider will give you the injections in your doctor’s office. Zostavax is also given as an intramuscular injection, but it only requires one dose.

Is second Shingrix shot worse than first?
-----------------------------------------

Which is better Shingrix vs Zostavax?
-------------------------------------

Is Shingrix THAT much better than Zostavax? Yes. Shingrix is 97% effective at preventing herpes zoster (shingles) in folks over 50 whereas the Zostavax shot is 50-64% effective in preventing shingles in those 50-70 and even lower for those over 70. Shingrix also stays effective for longer.
