How deep is the Zambezi River?
------------------------------

The Luangwa and the Kafue are the two largest left-hand tributaries of the Zambezi. The Kafue joins the main river in a quiet, deep stream about 590 feet (180 meters) wide.

Are there crocodiles in the Zambezi River?
------------------------------------------

The Nile Crocodile is endemic to the Zambezi River and there exists a resident and moving population in the area we raft. Some large crocodiles do walk into the gorge from the upper river, and others do inhabit larger quieter pools, and evidence (small hatchlings in areas) suggest they do breed.

How big is the Zambezi River in km?
-----------------------------------

This shallowness arises as the river enters a broad valley and spreads out over a large area. Only at one point, the Lupata Gorge, 320 km from its mouth, is the river confined between high hills. Here it is scarcely 200 m wide. Elsewhere it is from 5 to 8 km wide, flowing gently in many streams.

How tall are Victoria Falls and the Zambezi River?
--------------------------------------------------

The Victoria Falls are considered the boundary between the upper and middle Zambezi. Below them the river continues to flow due east for about 200 kilometres (120 mi), cutting through perpendicular walls of basalt 20 to 60 metres (66 to 200 ft) apart in hills 200 to 250 metres (660 to 820 ft) high.

Which is the left hand tributary of the Zambezi River?
------------------------------------------------------

The Luangwa and the Kafue are the two largest left-hand tributaries of the Zambezi. The Kafue joins the main river in a quiet deep stream about 180 metres (590 ft) wide. From this point the northward bend of the Zambezi is checked and the stream continues due east. At the confluence of the Luangwa (15°37′ S) it enters Mozambique.

Where does the Kafue River join the Zambezi River?
--------------------------------------------------

The Kafue joins the main river in a quiet deep stream about 180 metres (590 ft) wide. From this point the northward bend of the Zambezi is checked and the stream continues due east. At the confluence of the Luangwa (15°37′ S) it enters Mozambique.
