Is blue moon really blue?
-------------------------

Blue Moons that are blue are incredibly rare and have nothing to do with the calendar or the Moon’s phases but are instead a result of atmospheric conditions. Volcanic ashes and smoke, water droplets in the air, or certain types of clouds can all contribute to a Full Moon taking on a blue shade on rare occasions.

What does blue moon mean slang?
-------------------------------

1 : a very long period of time —usually used in the phrase once in a blue moon such people happen along only once in a blue moon — Saturday Rev. 2 : a second full moon in a calendar month.

Why is a blue moon so rare?
---------------------------

Blue-colored moons are rare – aren’t necessarily full – and happen when Earth’s atmosphere contains dust or smoke particles of a certain size. The particles must be slightly wider than 900 nanometers. You might find particles of this size in the air above you when, for example, a wildfire is raging nearby.

Where did the term Blue Moon come from?
---------------------------------------

The term simply refers to the unusual occurrence of a second full moon within one calendar month, and since we already had a full moon earlier this month, this will be a blue moon, the first seen in the United States since August 2012.

How often does a Blue Moon occur in a month?
--------------------------------------------

The rival definitions now go by different names. The third full moon in a season with four of them is called a “seasonal blue moon.” Meanwhile, the second full moon in a calendar month is called a ” monthly blue moon .” The latter phenomenon occurs once every two to three years.

What’s the difference between a Blue Moon and a full moon?
----------------------------------------------------------

The other meaning is that a Blue Moon is the second full moon within a single calendar month. This definition — a “monthly Blue Moon” — has gained popularity in recent years because of a misinterpretation of an almanac’s original definition.

Is it possible to see a Blue Moon?
----------------------------------

Unfortunately, the color “blue” has nothing to do with this event in outer space and a blue moon typically looks like any other full moon — big, bright, and beautiful but usually, not so blue. That’s not to say a literal blue moon is impossible to see.
