What are types of food chains?
------------------------------

There are 2 types of food chains, namely Grazing food chain and Detritous food chain. Grazing food chain starts from producers or plants and passes on to herbivorous primary consumers to carnivorous secondary consumers and ends with tertiary carnivorous animals.

What is class 2 food chain?
---------------------------

A food chain is the transfer of food energy from plants to an animal and then to another animal. Most food chains start with green plants making food energy from the sun. Then an animal eats the plant and another animal eats that animal. Green plants in a food chain are called producers.

What are the different types of food chains?
--------------------------------------------

When there are more cross interactions between different food chains, the food web gets more complex. This complexity in a food web leads to a more sustainable ecosystem. There are two types of food chains, namely detritus food chain and grazing food chain.

Which is an example of a grazing food chain?
--------------------------------------------

Grazing food chain: The grazing food chain is a type of food chain that starts with green plants, passes through herbivores and then to carnivores. In a grazing food chain, energy in the lowest trophic level is acquired from photosynthesis. In this type of food chain, the first energy transfer is from plants to herbivores.

How is a predator food chain different from a parasite food chain?
------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, the difference between predator food chain and a parasite food chain is that, in the latter chain, orgaÂ­nisms are smaller and smaller instead of being generally larger and larger. A. Grazing food chain, and B. Detritus food chain. It starts from a green plant base, goes to grazing herbivores and on to carnivores.

How many links are there in a food chain?
-----------------------------------------

The number of links in a food chain are usually three and very seldom it exceeds five. As we climb up a food chain we find that the size of the predators progressively increases. Finally, a stage is reached when the predator becomes so large in size that it can no longer be preyed upon.
