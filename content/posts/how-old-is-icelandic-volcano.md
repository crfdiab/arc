How old is Icelandic volcano?
-----------------------------

About 30 active volcanic systems can be found under the island, in all parts of the country other than the Westfjords. The Westfjords no longer have any activity because it is the oldest part of Iceland’s landmass, formed around 16 million years ago, and has since been pushed away from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

How long will the volcano in Iceland last?
------------------------------------------

It’s been three months since the eruption in Geldingadalir, Iceland began and experts say it could be years or even decades until it is over. If it does indeed last for decades, lava could reach the nearby town of Grindavík as well as Svartsengi power station.

How long did the Eyjafjallajökull eruption last in 2010?
--------------------------------------------------------

39-day  
The 39-day long eruption at the summit of Eyjafjallajökull volcano in April–May 2010 was of modest size but ash was widely dispersed. By combining data from ground surveys and remote sensing we show that the erupted material was 4.8±1.2·1011 kg (benmoreite and trachyte, dense rock equivalent volume 0.18±0.05 km3).

What is the age of a volcano?
-----------------------------

Most volcanoes are 10,000 to 100,000 years old — it takes time for them to grow big.

When did the volcano in Iceland start to erupt?
-----------------------------------------------

Subsequent movement rifted these later lava fields, causing long, linear valleys bounded by parallel faults. The divergence of the ridge started in the north about 150 million years ago and 90 million years ago in the south. These movements continue today, accompanied by earthquakes, reactivation of old volcanoes, and creation of new ones.

When did Iceland first appear over the ocean?
---------------------------------------------

The plume is believed to have caused the formation of Iceland itself, the island first appearing over the ocean surface about 16 to 18 million years ago. The result is an island characterized by repeated volcanism and geothermal phenomena such as geysers.

How old are the oldest rocks in Iceland?
----------------------------------------

The rocks at Gerpir yield an average age of 12.5 m.y. and are situated ca. 150 km from the centre of the active central zone, giving an apparent rate of K-Ar AGES OF THE OLDEST EXPOSED ROCKS’IN ICELAND crustal spreading of 1.2 cm/y.

How many years does it take for a volcano to go dormant in Iceland?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Some experts use a 4,500 year timescale for dormant volcanoes and a few do not distinguish between dormant and extinct volcanoes at all. Others utilize entirely different timescales. One fact is very certain: Iceland has many active, extinct and dormant volcanoes!
