Which longitude line is the prime meridian Why?
-----------------------------------------------

0 longitude  
The prime meridian separates the eastern hemisphere from the western hemisphere. Halfway around the world, at 180 degrees longitude, is the International Date Line. The prime meridian is the line of 0 longitude, the starting point for measuring distance both east and west around the Earth.

Is the Prime Meridian A reference line of Latitude longitude?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The primary reference line of latitude is the Equator, and the primary reference line of longitude is the Prime Meridian. The Equator is an imaginary reference line drawn around the Earth halfway between the North and South poles.

Where do the lines of longitude begin at the prime meridian?
------------------------------------------------------------

Because the earth is essentially a sphere, lines of longitude range from 0° to 180° east and west of the prime meridian with 0° east and west longitude beginning at the prime meridian and 180° east and west longitude being at a point on the other side of the earth directly opposite the prime meridian.

Where are the longitude lines in the Eastern Hemisphere?
--------------------------------------------------------

It is 180° longitude. Eastern Hemisphere Longitude lines to the right of the prime meridian give locations east Western Hemisphere Longitude lines to the left of the prime meridian give locations west Latitude a measurement of distance in degrees north and south of the equator. They run East and West Longitude

Is the Eastern Hemisphere east of the prime meridian?
-----------------------------------------------------

The eastern hemisphere is east of the prime meridian and west of the International Date Line. Most of Earths landmasses, including all of Asia and Australia, and most of Africa, are part of the eastern hemisphere.

Where is the 180° east and west longitude located?
--------------------------------------------------

meridian and 180° east and west longitude being at a point on the other side of the earth directly opposite the prime meridian. The line defining the 180° east and west longitude is referred to as the International Date Line. International time is measured with respect to the prime meridian, while the International Date
