----------------------------------

A typical low-profile, 300′ long timber vehicular bridge, with custom guide rails, can be completed in under 60 days. Every site is different. Every bridge is different. In general, our process of design, materials procurement and construction can be faster than bridges made with concrete or steel.

What makes a bridge so strong?
------------------------------

Simply, Concrete, steel, and geometry. Their combination, their quality and their quantity, everything is crucial to make bridge strong. Bridges are often made using arches of concrete. Concrete has very high compression strength, and an arch is almost entirely under compression instead of tension.

How much does it cost to build a small bridge?
----------------------------------------------

Even a simple pedestrian bridge might cost $250,000. That is a quarter of a million dollars! As part of designing and constructing bridges, engineers pay close attention to the cost of a bridge. They must find a balance between the cost and size and materials, and design and safety of a bridge.

How much does it cost to build a bridge over a highway?
-------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Highway Administration estimates that pedestrian bridges range from $150 to $250 per square foot, totaling a cost of approximately $1 million to $5 million per complete installation.

What is the most stable type of bridge?
---------------------------------------

A truss bridge is the strongest kind of bridge. They flex less than other kinds of bridges and provide greater stability even in extreme weather or traffic. Truss bridges have a basic design that couples repeated triangular conglomeration so as to create a matrix of support structures.

How to build your own bridge in build a bridge?
-----------------------------------------------

Time to construct your very own bridges so that the truck can safely cross to the other side. Follow the interactive tutorial to learn how to play, then try to complete all 10 challenging levels. Try to build a strong bridge so that the vehicle can cross the gap without falling down below.

How big of a hole do you drill for a bridge?
--------------------------------------------

Measure, square and stake a rectangle that’s 4 feet wide and 12 feet long, centered lengthwise over the gap. You will install concrete or wooden footers just inside the four corners of your marked area. Drill four 8-inch-diameter (or larger) holes, completely inside the rectangle’s corners, at least 3 feet deep with your tractor.

Which is the first step in building a bridge?
---------------------------------------------

In such situations, the road has the capability to be lifted or pivoted, to permit marine traffic movement under it. Construction of the foundations is the first step toward building a bridge. This process involves detailed geotechnical investigations of the bridge site.
