When was radium and polonium discovered?
----------------------------------------

1898  
On April 20, 1902, Marie and Pierre Curie successfully isolate radioactive radium salts from the mineral pitchblende in their laboratory in Paris. In 1898, the Curies discovered the existence of the elements radium and polonium in their research of pitchblende.

Who discovered polonium in 1898?

What element did Henri Becquerel discover?
------------------------------------------

uranium salts  
When Henri Becquerel investigated the newly discovered X-rays in 1896, it led to studies of how uranium salts are affected by light. By accident, he discovered that uranium salts spontaneously emit a penetrating radiation that can be registered on a photographic plate.

Who discovered polonium?
------------------------

 Marie Curie  
Pierre Curie  
Polonium/Discoverers

Polonium, (element 84), was discovered in 1898 and named after Poland, the homeland of Marie Curie (Ne Sklodowska) who found it with her husband Pierre Curie.

Who is the father of radioactive?
---------------------------------

Henri Becquerel  
In one of the most well-known accidental discoveries in the history of physics, on an overcast day in March 1896, French physicist Henri Becquerel opened a drawer and discovered spontaneous radioactivity.

Why did they lick the paintbrush in Radium Girls?
-------------------------------------------------

In the 1920s, hundreds of young women working in factories were exposed to so much of the chemical element that their gravesites can still set off Geiger counters. The women would dip their brushes into radium, lick the tip of the brushes to give them a precise point, and paint the numbers onto the dial.

Who are the scientists who discovered radium and polonium?
----------------------------------------------------------

They also reached to the element polonium. Marie and Pierre Curie with Henri Becquerel received the Noble Prize in Physics for their break through discovery for the radioactive elements. Later in the year 1910, Marie Curie with André-Louis Debierne (1874-1949) who was a French chemist, have reached for the pure metal radium. Related

Who was Henri Becquerel and what did he discover?
-------------------------------------------------

Henri Becquerel and the Discovery of Radioactivity Henri Becquerel was a French physicist who discovered radioactivity. He won the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre and Marie Curie for this discovery. Henri Becquerel was a French physicist who discovered radioactivity.

When did Pierre Curie announce the discovery of polonium?
---------------------------------------------------------

On January 1, 1896, he mailed his first announcement of the discovery to his colleagues. “… und nun ging der Teufel los” (“and now the Devil was let loose”) he wrote. His discovery very soon made an impact on practical medicine. In physics it led to a chain of new and sensational findings.

How did Marie Curie discover the element radium?
------------------------------------------------

They reached of 100 milligrams of radium from tons of uraninite. They found that the new element, which is radium, is powerful than the uranium. They also reached to the element polonium. Marie and Pierre Curie with Henri Becquerel received the Noble Prize in Physics for their break through discovery for the radioactive elements.
