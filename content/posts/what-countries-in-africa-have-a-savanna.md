Where in Africa is the savanna biome?
-------------------------------------

southern Africa  
The Savanna Biome is the largest Biome in southern Africa, occupying 46% of its area, and over one-third the area of South Africa. It is well developed over the lowveld and Kalahari region of South Africa and is also the dominant vegetation in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

Where is the savanna vegetation?
--------------------------------

Africa  
Savannas – also known as tropical grasslands – are found to the north and south of tropical rainforest biomes. The largest expanses of savanna are in Africa, where much of the central part of the continent, for example Kenya and Tanzania, consists of tropical grassland.

Where is the savanna found?
---------------------------

The largest areas of savanna are found in Africa, South America, Australia, India, the Myanmar (Burma)–Thailand region in Asia, and Madagascar.

What are the types of savanna?
------------------------------

There are five different types of savannas:

- Tropical and subtropical savannas: found near the equator and bordered by tropical rainforests and deserts (e.g., the Serengeti in Africa)
- Temperate savannas: found in mid-latitude regions (e.g., temperate savanna of Southeast Australia)

What kind of vegetation does a Savannah have?
---------------------------------------------

Savanna, also spelled savannah, vegetation type that grows under hot, seasonally dry climatic conditions and is characterized by an open tree canopy (i.e., scattered trees) above a continuous tall grass understory (the vegetation layer between the forest canopy and the ground).

Where are the savanna areas located in Africa?
----------------------------------------------

Africa: Western Africa. …into two zones, the Sudanic savanna and the Guinea Coast. The savanna area stretches for some 3,000 miles (4,800 km) east to west along the southern Saharan borderland. Its vegetation consists of extensive grasslands and few forests, and little rain falls there.

Are there more trees in a savanna than a forest?
------------------------------------------------

It is often believed that savannas feature widely spaced, scattered trees. However, in many savannas, tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forests.

What kind of climate does the Mediterranean savanna have?
---------------------------------------------------------

Mediterranean savannas are mid-latitude savannas in Mediterranean climate regions, with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers, part of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. The oak tree savannas of California, part of the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, fall into this category.
