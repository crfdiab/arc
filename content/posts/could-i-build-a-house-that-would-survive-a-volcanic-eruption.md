Could I build a house that would survive a volcanic eruption?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseHawaiian and Icelandic volcanoes produce slow-moving lava. Lava temperature is 700-1,200°C, so it melts or ignites most things. A house on stilts of titanium or tungsten might survive, if the stilts were strong enough to withstand the lava pushing against them.

How do you survive a volcanic eruption in the place you live?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Survival during an eruption

1. Close all windows, doors, and fireplace or woodstove dampers.
2. Turn off all fans and heating and air conditioning systems.
3. Bring pets and livestock into closed shelters.
4. Keep necessities on hand.
5. Listen for emergency alerts and do what they say.
6. Stay inside until you hear that it’s safe to come out.

Is there anything you can do if a volcano erupts?
-------------------------------------------------

No. If a volcano is going to erupt, nothing on earth can keep it from happening, but you can survive an eruption by getting as far away as possible or going to a shelter.

How can you tell when a volcano is about to erupt?
--------------------------------------------------

Deformation changes at a volcano, such as those related to magnitude or location, may indicate that an eruption is about to occur. An example of visible deformation occurred in 1980 when a bulge appeared on the north flank of Mount St. Helens prior to its May 18 eruption.

How are people killed during a volcanic eruption?
-------------------------------------------------

In recent eruptions, many people have been killed because they did not heed an evacuation order. If you are lucky enough to get advance warning, use it wisely instead of trying to hold your ground. It’s also important to evacuate the area as soon as possible after being told to do so.

What happens if you fall through a hot spot on a volcano?
---------------------------------------------------------

Hot spots, geysers, and mudpots are common on volcanoes. The ground around these is typically very thin, and a fall through could result in serious burns or death. Never try to cross these during an eruption, and otherwise cross them only on safe, marked paths.
