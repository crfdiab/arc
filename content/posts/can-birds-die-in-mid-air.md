Can birds die in mid air?
-------------------------

Birds don’t usually drop dead in mid-flight – they die in their nest or are caught and eaten, much like other small animals.

Do birds ever collide in mid air?
---------------------------------

It’s a simple question that you’ve probably never thought about: with all those birds flying around, how come you never see two birds crash mid-air? They found that birds have evolved a simple way to avoid mid-air collisions: each bird always veers right and changes altitude.

Do birds ever crash?
--------------------

There are over 13,000 bird strikes annually in the US alone. However, the number of major accidents involving civil aircraft is quite low and it has been estimated that there is only about 1 accident resulting in human death in one billion (109) flying hours.

What happens when plane hits bird?
----------------------------------

A double engine bird strike is extremely unlikely (although a now famous flock of poor Canadian geese might disagree), but if one engine failed due to a bird strike, it wouldn’t matter. All aircraft are designed to work just fine with an engine out. In fact most are certified to cross half an ocean on a single engine.

What happens if a bird flies too high?
--------------------------------------

“As they go higher, they have to flap harder to stay aloft, so their metabolic demands increase. The oxygen levels become more limited. At high altitudes, it gets colder, and they need to keep their bodies warm. And the air gets drier — they’re more likely to lose water from breathing and evaporation, and be thirsty.”

Why do birds never crash into each other in mid air?
----------------------------------------------------

What’s more, the birds tended to avoid any head-on collisions by always turning right, or in some cases changing altitude so that they weren’t on the same level. Here’s an example of a collision being avoided: If playback doesn’t begin shortly, try restarting your device.

Can a bird hover in the air while feeding?
------------------------------------------

However, in the bird’s referential the flight is not stationary. It is typically common to see that for see birds. In absence of head wind, most birds aren’t able to hover. There are a few exceptions. Hummingbirds hover while feeding on nectar.

Why are so many birds dying in the United States?
-------------------------------------------------

An alarming “mass die-off” of wild birds in the southwestern U.S. has scientists worried—and perplexed. The cause is not at all clear, with some scientists theorizing that climate change factors are playing a part. Most of the birds are insect eaters, and they’ve been found emaciated and disoriented, suggesting a gap in the food supply.

How are birds able to avoid one another?
----------------------------------------

Birds always seem to avoid one another, even if they’re flying on what looks like a collision course. In a study published Wednesday in PLOS ONE, researchers from the University of Queensland decided to look into how this happens.
