Can you breathe in high air pressure?
-------------------------------------

In order for your lungs to breathe air in without duress, the pressure has to be higher outside your body. But at high altitudes, the outside air pressure is lower than it is inside your lungs, making it more difficult to pull in the thinner air and for your veins to pump oxygen throughout the body.

What is the air pressure in Denver Colorado?

The highest barometer reading ever recorded is about 32 inches or just over 15.6 PSI. The lowest barometer reading ever recorded was 25.69 in the middle of a hurricane so this is not typical but equates to about 12.5 PSI. These are all sea level readings. So we need an average, or normal.

How is air pressure measured in the air?
----------------------------------------

Air pressure is measured in different ways. Two common ones are PSI (pounds per square inch) or a barometer which measures in column inches of Mercury. As we know the barometer goes up and down with weather so the air pressure goes up and down.
