What is a prairie habitat?
--------------------------

Prairies are enormous stretches of flat grassland with moderate temperatures, moderate rainfall, and few trees. When people talk about the prairie, they are usually referring to the golden, wheat-covered land in the middle of North America.

Why is a prairie important?
---------------------------

Why are prairies important? They provide rare native habitat for birds, butterflies, insects, reptiles, and other small wildlife. They require little maintenance, are long lasting, and do not need fertilizers or pesticides. They are perfectly adapted to our climate.

What kind of organisms live in a prairie?
-----------------------------------------

Name one organism found in each habitat. The two different habitats that can be found in the prairie ecosystem are the tall grass prairie and the short grass prairie. The tall grass prairie is found in the eastern side of the Great Plains. A variety of grass grow in the tall grass prairie such as switch grass, Indian grass and big bluestem.

Where are the different habitats in the Great Plains?
-----------------------------------------------------

Identify two different habitats in a prairie ecosystem. Name one organism found in each habitat. The two different habitats that can be found in the prairie ecosystem are the tall grass prairie and the short grass prairie. The tall grass prairie is found in the eastern side of the Great Plains.

What makes a prairie ecosystem a complex ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------------

A Complex Prairie Ecosystem. Prairies exist in areas too wet for desert yet too dry to support healthy forests. Prairies respond to their environment, which includes soil type, water availability, and natural forces such as grazing and fire. These have resulted in three distinct prairie regions.

How are prairie plants adapted to their environment?
----------------------------------------------------

Fires sweep across the prairie consuming everything in its path. On top of this there is a barrage of organisms feeding on these plants as fast as they grow. The secret to the survival of the prairie plants in such a hostile environment is that 75-80% of the prairies biomass, or plant material, is underground.
