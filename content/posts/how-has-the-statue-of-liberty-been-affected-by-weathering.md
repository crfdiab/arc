How has the Statue of Liberty been affected by weathering?
----------------------------------------------------------

Over time, the weathering of the copper created a thin layer of copper carbonate called a patina. Although some people were worried that the changing color of the statue meant it was decaying, the patina actually protects the copper underneath from further corrosion. The statue alone stands 151 feet tall.

What is the pollution that creates acid rain at the Statue of Liberty?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The most suspected culprit: rain acidity. Acid rain, although not fully understood, is thought to be caused by increased sulfur oxide air pollution. Combined with water in the atmosphere, sulfur oxides form acids which fall to earth and erode stone and metal and kill fish in lakes.

Is acid rain corroding the Statue of Liberty?
---------------------------------------------

Despite these measures, copper and iron cannot avoid oxygen’s “radical” nature and the Statue of Liberty will never be safe from corrosion. The Statue of Liberty will probably turn black due to the reaction between copper oxide on its surface and acid rain.

What type of erosion affects the Statue of Liberty?
---------------------------------------------------

The Statue of Liberty has experienced natural weathering over the years. Eventually, the statue’s copper turned green. Patina, is the greenish result is called, occurs due to chemical reactions between water and metal.

How does pollution affect the Statue of Liberty?
------------------------------------------------

Statue Turning Black From Polluted Air : Acid Corrosion Mars Liberty’s Renewal. “There is nothing that can be done about it,” said Robert Baboian, a corrosion expert and consultant to the U.S. Park Service on the restoration of the statue. He said the darkening is a result of sustained exposure to man-made acids.

What does the effect of acid rain cost us in terms of money?
------------------------------------------------------------

Acid rain is estimated to cause $5 billion in damages annually in a 17-state region by corroding buildings and other structures, according to a new draft study for the Government.

How does acid rain affect buildings, monuments and statues?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The acid rain is found to make a slow corrosion of monuments. The monuments that are made with the building material like marbles and limestone etc. Let me make you understand this with simple words. The polluted and acidified rain droplets fall on the building material of these monuments and cause corrosion.

Why did they redo the Statue of Liberty?
----------------------------------------

Acid rain is part of the reason why the Statue Of Liberty got re-done. The effect of acid rain can cause monuments to be discolored, or disfigured (like the Statue Of Liberty they had to redo her because of acid rain was effecting the monument’s color and disfiguration). The tombstone got its black spots from acid rain.

Why is the Statue of Liberty’s roof green?
------------------------------------------

The Statue of Liberty is green because of acid rain and the salt water because if you put it in a cup of water with salt and vinegar it will start to make acid. Why does a copper roof turn green?

How did weathering affect the Statue of Liberty?
------------------------------------------------

Galvanic corrosion is the most important kind of chemical weathering that affected the statue is called. Galvanic corrosion occurs when two different type of metals contact with each other and an electrolyte; in the case of the Statue of Liberty, is made out of copper and iron, and the electrolyte is seawater.
