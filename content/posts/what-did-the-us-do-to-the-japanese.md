What did the US do to the Japanese?
-----------------------------------

The United States made a massive investment in naval power and systematically destroyed Japan’s offensive capabilities while island hopping across the Pacific. To force a surrender, the Americans systematically bombed Japanese cities, culminating in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.

What did the US cut off from Japan?
-----------------------------------

Washington froze Japan’s financial assets in the United States. This effectively cut off Tokyo’s ability to buy oil — a de facto petroleum embargo. The British and Dutch did the same, shutting off supplies from the East Indies.

What did Japan have that the US wanted?
---------------------------------------

The United States had an interest in Japan in the 1800s also. The United States wanted to control Japan so we could help rebuild the country and its economy. We felt rebuilding Japan and its economy would help to keep Japan from becoming a communist nation. In the 1850s, the United States wanted to trade with Japan.

Why did the US block oil to Japan?
----------------------------------

On July 26, 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt seizes all Japanese assets in the United States in retaliation for the Japanese occupation of French Indo-China. Japan’s oil reserves were only sufficient to last three years, and only half that time if it went to war and consumed fuel at a more frenzied pace.

Why did the US rebuild Japan?
-----------------------------

Goals for reconstruction were democratic self-government, economic stability, and peaceful Japanese co-existence with the community of nations. The United States allowed Japan to keep its emperor — Hirohito — after the war.

Why did the US and Japan Reject the UN proposal?
------------------------------------------------

The United States, Japan and Austria all laid out issues they had with the proposed law. The United States (in summary) stated they wished their own local laws to take precedent over the UN’s proposed laws:

Why did Japan declare war on the US?
------------------------------------

Historical context. The document declares the war against the United States and British Empire, discusses their presumed disruptive actions against Empire of Japan’s foreign policy and states that all avenues for averting war have been exhausted from the Government of Japan.

What was the condition for Japan to surrender?
----------------------------------------------

These conditions probably would require, at a minimum, that the Japanese home islands remain unoccupied by foreign forces and even allow Japan to retain some of its wartime conquests in East Asia.

Why did the US put an oil embargo on Japan?
-------------------------------------------

Japan had invaded much of East Asia to create what they called the “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere”, now largely viewed as a pretext for imperialism. In response, the U.S. imposed an oil embargo on Japan in August 1941 to stop aiding their aggression in Asia and to contain Japanese actions such as their war crimes in Nanking.
