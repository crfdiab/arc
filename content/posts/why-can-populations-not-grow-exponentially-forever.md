Why can populations not grow exponentially forever?
---------------------------------------------------

D. In an ecosystem, no population can grow exponentially forever. Each ecosystem has a certain supply of resources and that can only sustain a particular population size of a given species. The size of the sustainable population depends on the available resources and the rate at which they are generated.

Can exponential growth continue forever?
----------------------------------------

In the real world, with its limited resources, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. Exponential growth may occur in environments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources, but when the number of individuals becomes large enough, resources will be depleted, slowing the growth rate.

What affects exponential growth?
--------------------------------

In exponential growth, a populationâ€™s per capita (per individual) growth rate stays the same regardless of population size, making the population grow faster and faster as it gets larger. In nature, populations may grow exponentially for some period, but they will ultimately be limited by resource availability.

What 3 things can limit the growth of a population?
---------------------------------------------------

In the natural world, limiting factors like the availability of food, water, shelter and space can change animal and plant populations. Other limiting factors, like competition for resources, predation and disease can also impact populations.

Why is it impossible for exponential growth to continue?
--------------------------------------------------------

Given a large enough supply of nutrients, the number of bacteria in a colony will tend to grow exponentially, but eventually the model will fail, because the bacteria will run out of room or nutrients to grow.

Can a population of organisms grow exponentially?
-------------------------------------------------

Thus, each population will reach an equilibrium size and will be maintained at that level. Each ecosystem has a certain supply of resources and that can only sustain a particular population size of a given species. The size of the sustainable population depends on the available resources and the rate at which they are generated.

Which is an example of an exponential growth model?
---------------------------------------------------

A typical example would be an exponential growth model of a population of bacteria. Given a large enough supply of nutrients, the number of bacteria in a colony will tend to grow exponentially, but eventually the model will fail, because the bacteria will run out of room or nutrients to grow.
