How did the missionaries change Hawaii?
---------------------------------------

In Hawaii, the missionaries converted Hawaiian people to the Christian faith, developed the written form of Hawaiian, discouraged many Hawaiian cultural practices, introduced their Western practices, and encouraged the spread of English.
