How many orbits of the moon in a year?
--------------------------------------

13 times  
The Moon makes a complete orbit around the Earth approximately once every 28 days. This means that the Moon orbits the Earth around 13 times in a year.

What orbit does the moon have?
------------------------------

circular orbit  
The Moon has a nearly circular orbit (e=0.05) which is tilted about 5° to the plane of the Earth’s orbit. Its average distance from the Earth is 384,400 km.

Does the moon orbit every 28 days?
----------------------------------

Near and far sides of the moon The moon orbits the Earth once every 27.322 days. It also takes approximately 27 days for the moon to rotate once on its axis.

Can a moon orbit a moon?
------------------------

A subsatellite, also known as a submoon or moonmoon, is a natural or artificial satellite that orbits a natural satellite, i.e. a “moon of a moon”. It is inferred from the empirical study of natural satellites in the Solar System that subsatellites may be elements of planetary systems.

How many moons does each planet have in the Solar System?
---------------------------------------------------------

As of May 2018, There are close to 350 moons in the Solar System. There are total 175 moons which orbit 8 planets in the solar system and there are 9 moons which orbit 5 dwarf planets and rest of them orbit other solar system bodies like asteroids etc. 2. Venus and Mercury are the only planets which do not have any moon.

How long does it take the Moon to orbit around the Earth?
---------------------------------------------------------

There are several different periods associated with the lunar orbit. The sidereal month is the time it takes to make one complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars. It is about 27.32 days. The synodic month is the time it takes the Moon to reach the same visual phase.

How big is the Moon compared to the Earth?
------------------------------------------

 Earth has just one moon – a rocky, cratered place, roughly a quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles away. The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet. All 3D models in the page have loaded

Are there any satellites in orbit around the Moon?
--------------------------------------------------

Near the beginning of the video, it mentioned a handful of the objects that landed there over the decades. Then at about the 5 minute mark, it begins talking about satellites in orbit around the Moon and it made me wonder what’s up there.
