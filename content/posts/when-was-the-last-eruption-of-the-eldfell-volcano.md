Is the Eldfell volcano in the Westman Islands steep?
----------------------------------------------------

Eldfell Volcano in the Westman Islands. To gain a deeper insight, I hiked to the top of this maroon volcano. It is a bit steep, not too steep though, but I had to stop a couple of times to catch my breath and take in the beautiful view. Unfortunately, it was foggy during my visit, but still, I had a beautiful view of the Westman Islands.

Is the lava on top of Mt Eldfell still hot?
-------------------------------------------

The lava is so bright and takes on so many hues of the red colour that I was in awe. The lava on top of Mt. Eldfell is still hot in places and steam was coming from underneath. Just imagine how hot this volcano still is, 46 years after the eruption!

What did the islanders do after the Eldfell eruption?

An operation was mounted to cool the advancing lava flow by pumping sea water onto it, which was successful in preventing the loss of the harbour. After the eruption, the islanders used heat from the cooling lava flows to provide hot water and to generate electricity.
