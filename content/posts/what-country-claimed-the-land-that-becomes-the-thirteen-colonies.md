What country claimed the land that becomes the thirteen colonies?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Great Britain  
Great Britain claimed all of North America east of the Mississippi River. It had thirteen colonies.

Were the 13 colonies claimed from the country of Spain?
-------------------------------------------------------

In 1753, France and Spain claimed land to the north, south, and west of the 13 colonies.

What country held the land west of the 13 original colonies before 1783?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

British America  
These colonies were formally known as British America and the British West Indies before the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and formed the United States of America.

Where did the Thirteen Colonies declare their independence?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Thirteen colonies of the Kingdom of Great Britain in North America collectively declared their independence as the United States of America, though several colonies had already individually declared independence: The Colony of Connecticut, becoming the State of Connecticut

Who was the first state to claim land in the west?
--------------------------------------------------

The process required nearly 20 years and was completed by the successor government under the new U.S. Constitution. Virginia. Being the possessor of the oldest colonial charter, Virginians felt confident that they had the best claim to lands in the west.

What was Connecticut’s claim to western United States?
------------------------------------------------------

Connecticut put forth a claim to a swath of land from its western boundary to the Mississippi River. A claim to a portion of Pennsylvania (not shown on the map) was asserted only half-heartedly because of the strength of a more recent charter held by that state.

What was New York’s claim to the Western Reserve?
-------------------------------------------------

Western Land Claims. Connecticut and New York jointly claimed lands in the Old Northwest, but New York surrendered its rights in 1785 and Connecticut followed the next year. However, Connecticut’s claim to an area known as the Western Reserve was maintained until 1795, when it was purchased by the Connecticut Land Company.
