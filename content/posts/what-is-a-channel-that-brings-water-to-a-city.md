What is the channel that brings water to a city from nearby hills?
------------------------------------------------------------------

An aqueduct is a watercourse constructed to carry water from a source to a distribution point far away.

How do aqueducts transport water?
---------------------------------

The Romans constructed aqueducts throughout their Republic and later Empire, to bring water from outside sources into cities and towns. Aqueducts moved water through gravity alone, along a slight overall downward gradient within conduits of stone, brick, or concrete; the steeper the gradient, the faster the flow.

What’s an example of aqueduct?
------------------------------

An example of an aqueduct is the aqueduct of Sylvius which is a canal that connects the third and fourth ventricles of the brain and contains cerebrospinal fluid. The definition of an aqueduct is a man-made tube or channel used for transporting water a long distance. An example of an aqueduct is the Zanja Madre.

How do aqueducts work?
----------------------

Aqueducts moved water through gravity alone, along a slight overall downward gradient within conduits of stone, brick, or concrete; the steeper the gradient, the faster the flow.

Where are aqueducts still used today?
-------------------------------------

Roman aqueducts are still in use in countries such as Italy, France, Portugal, Israel and Turkey. In ancient times, aqueducts were used to transport all water to the cities, but today many of them are only used for irrigation purposes.

Where is the gene for a water channel located?
----------------------------------------------

Moving slowly lets the rubber of the o-ring compress and slip past the edges of a water channel or other transitions instead of being cut by these edges in a single swift movement. The gene encodes a protein called a water channel, which normally resides within the outer membranes of cells.

What does Rawalpindi people use the water channel for?
------------------------------------------------------

Rawalpindi people use the water channel as garbage dump, which restricts flow of water causing urban flood. The entire passages of the two water channels would be combed, surveyed and examined carefully to see where contaminated water enters into the water channel and the reservoir.
