What are the purpose of satellites when it comes to geography?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Satellites are amazing tools for observing the Earth and the big blue ocean that covers more than 70 percent of our planet. By remotely sensing from their orbits high above the Earth, satellites provide us much more information than would be possible to obtain solely from the surface.

What are the benefits of a satellite map?
-----------------------------------------

Advantages of Satellite Imagery Satellites circle the Earth, so their imaging activity can be repeated easily. It also allows for much greater areas of coverage and, because all information is digital, it can be easily integrated with software.

For which purpose is remote sensing satellite used?
---------------------------------------------------

Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft). Special cameras collect remotely sensed images, which help researchers “sense” things about the Earth.

How do satellites help us in our daily life?
--------------------------------------------

From space, they provide information and services to support global communications, the economy, security and defence, safety and emergency management, the environment and health. As technology advances, the potential of satellites will undoubtedly continue to grow.

What do satellites tell us?
---------------------------

NASA’s satellites carry sensors that observe Earth to better understand the environment. These satellite sensors gather information about weather, landforms, oceans, vegetation, land use, and other things. The information is transmitted to computers on Earth.

How good is satellite imagery?
------------------------------

Satellite images are only as good as their resolution. The smaller the pixel size, the sharper the image. But even high-resolution images need to be validated on the ground to ensure the trustworthiness of the interpretation.

How do satellites take pictures of the earth?
---------------------------------------------

The satellite and aerial images in Google Earth are taken by cameras on satellites and aircraft, which collect each image at a specific date and time.
