How are deserts affected by erosion?
------------------------------------

As vegetation dies out, the soil is more easily eroded and may be lost so that other vegetation becomes destabilized. Since soil can hold moisture, if the soil erodes, the area may become arid, and the desert expands.

What is the result of wind erosion in desert?
---------------------------------------------

Wind erosion abrades surfaces and makes desert pavement, ventifacts, and desert varnish. Sand dunes are common wind deposits that come in different shapes, depending on winds and sand availability. Loess is a very fine grained, wind-borne deposit that can be important to soil formation.

Why is erosion by running water important in deserts?
-----------------------------------------------------

Why is erosion by running water important in deserts? Most desert streams dry up long before they ever reach the ocean. The streams are quickly depleted by evaporation and soil infiltration. Although deserts experience more wind erosion than other places, water is still the foremost agent that carves arid landscapes.

What is the most important effect of wind erosion?
--------------------------------------------------

The most important effect of wind erosion; the removal of loose particles of sand and soil by the wind. Strong windstorms in arid regions are often referred to as this. Huge heaps of loose, windblown sand common in deserts and near beaches.

What are two ways that wind causes erosion?
-------------------------------------------

The phrase “wind erosion” describes the way air movement breaks down stones, rocks and other formations of solid matter on the Earth’s surface. Wind erosion uses two main mechanics: abrasion and deflation. Deflation is further broken down into three categories: surface creep, saltation and suspension.

What are the four main causes of erosion?
-----------------------------------------

The agents of soil erosion are the same as of other types of erosion: water, ice, wind, and gravity.

What causes erosion in the deserts of the world?
------------------------------------------------

Related Questions More Answers Below. Erosion in the deserts can be caused by the wind, by water (either as mist, dew, rain, ice, rivers, creeks, and all its forms), sand and dust propelled by the wind and rain, heating by the sun, cooling in the night, frost wedging, chemical alteration by creatures and plants.

How does wind and water influence desert landforms?
---------------------------------------------------

Today, there is a common belief that both wind and water influence landforms greatly. The question is which one is more influential? During the late 19 th Century it was commonly believed that wind erosion and deposition formed features such as yardangs, zeugen, pedestal rocks, ventifacts and deflation hollows.

Which is more likely to cause erosion, wind or water?
-----------------------------------------------------

It may seem surprising, but water generally causes more erosion than does the wind in most deserts (figure above a). Water erosion begins with the impacts of raindrops, which eject sediment from the ground into the air. On a hill, the ejected sediment lands downslope.

How does human use of the desert affect the environment?
--------------------------------------------------------

There are many issues when humans use deserts and their surrounding areas. This is a problem which affects many areas. When the soil is left bare, the wind can pick up speed due to the flat land and blow away the unprotected soil. The soil is exposed and vulnerable to erosion as a result of the removal of vegetation and overgrazing.
