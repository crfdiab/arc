Are debt Counselors free?
-------------------------

During debt and credit counseling, a financial counselor will help you understand your financial situation, learn about your options, and make a plan to meet your financial goals. Debt counseling and credit counseling are free.

Is California debt relief real?
-------------------------------

While a debt consolidation program might offer a way to solve money issues and avoid bankruptcy, it is just one of a number of assistance plans available in California. The state offers financial aid for crisis situations, help with medical expenses, legal aid and help dealing with debt collectors.

Is there a free debt relief program?
------------------------------------

There is no government program that forgives or even minimizes the burden of paying off your credit card balances. There are, however, 501(c)3 nonprofit consumer credit counseling services that work with you to provide debt relief.

Are there any government programs to help with debt?
----------------------------------------------------

While the government does not sponsor debt relief programs, it aims to protect the financial safety of consumers and offers other types of financial assistance. If you’re overburdened by debt, you may have been told to seek “government debt relief programs”, but to the contrary, such a program does not exist.

What are the disadvantages of debt Counselling?
-----------------------------------------------

Debt counselling cons

- You are not allowed to have more credit while undergoing debt counselling.
- It does cost a little bit of money, but the fees are set by law.
- Your debts might take longer to pay off as a result of paying smaller amounts each month. What do debt collectors have to do?
    -----------------------------------
    
    What Debt Collectors Do. Debt collectors use letters and phone calls to contact delinquent borrowers and try to convince them to repay what they owe. Collectors may report delinquent debts to credit bureaus to encourage consumers to pay since delinquent debts can do serious damage to a consumer’s credit score.
    
    How likely is it for a credit card company to sue you?
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
    Credit card companies sue for non-payment in about 15% of collection cases. Usually debt holders only have to worry about lawsuits if their accounts become 180-days past due and charge off, or default. However, the creditor is less likely to do so if the balance owed is under $1,000, or if the debt is settled.
    
    What is National Debt Relief?
    -----------------------------
    
    National Debt Relief Services doesn’t charge any upfront fees, and there’s no cost to sign up. Our clients pay a fee based on how much we are able to save them; however, payments only are only due once a client is in a debt relief program, legally protected from creditors, and their situation is being resolved.
    
    Is debt counseling a good idea?
    -------------------------------
    
    If you are over-indebted, a debt counsellor can negotiate with your credit providers on your behalf to get lower interest rates and reduced monthly instalments. This makes your debt more manageable and teaches you accountability as your agreement with your debt counsellor can fall away if you miss a payment.
    
    How do I get out of debt counseling?
    ------------------------------------
    
    A: Request a clearance certificate from your debt counsellor and submit it to the credit bureau. The credit bureau will then remove the debt review status from your credit report.
