How do the ice crystals grow in a cold cloud?
---------------------------------------------

Cold clouds can consist of supercooled droplets or ice particles or a mixture of both. Ice crystals in a cloud of liquid droplets are in a favorable environment to grow by diffusion because the environment is supersaturated with respect to ice.

What causes ice crystals in ice cream?
--------------------------------------

The “ice” in “ice cream” is the result of the water in the milk freezing. Crystals form when a particular species of molecule is given the opportunity to align with other of those same molecules. These molecules have a habit of bonding in a patterned way, resulting in the polyhedral structures we call “crystals”.

What is this ice crystal called?
--------------------------------

What is another word for ice crystals?

<table><tr><th>frost</th><th>hoarfrost</th></tr><tr><td>icecap</td><td>hailstone</td></tr><tr><td>crystal</td><td>cube ice</td></tr><tr><td>chunk</td><td>berg</td></tr><tr><td>sleet</td><td>ice floe</td></tr></table>

How do you fix ice crystals in ice cream?
-----------------------------------------

Once the ice cream’s spun, work quickly to transfer it from the bowl and into the freezer as fast as possible. Freezing fast will help maintain the ice crystals’ small size.

What makes ice crystals form in the air?
----------------------------------------

Sometimes, long, needlelike ice crystals form in the air above a cloud. They can get an electrostatic charge, like when you rub a balloon against your hair. When they do, they tend to align themselves along the electric field of the cloud. When a lightning bolt discharges, the electric field of the cloud changes suddenly.

What do ice crystals above a cloud look like?
---------------------------------------------

Ice crystals above clouds dance and flash according to electric fields. “Crown flashes” (or “jumping sun dogs”) are bizarre optical phenomena over storm clouds, moving like a searchlight or a huge light saber.

How are ice crystals related to water saturation?
-------------------------------------------------

As the ice crystals grow by vapor deposition, they deplete the vapor content, thereby driving the environment below water saturation. The cloud droplets will then evaporate, which helps sustain a vapor pressure difference between ice and water. By this process ice crystals are then said to grow at the expense of cloud droplets.

Why do ice crystals grow at the expense of cloud droplets?
----------------------------------------------------------

By this process ice crystals are then said to grow at the expense of cloud droplets. This process has been described by Wegener (1911), Bergeron (1935), and Findeisen (1938). It should be noted that because the Bergeron-Findeisen process causes the evaporation of cloud droplets, it can also affect the contact nucleation process.
