What are the major pollution problems caused by urban areas?
------------------------------------------------------------

Urban environmental problems are mostly inadequate water supply, wastewater, solid waste, energy, loss of green and natural spaces, urban sprawl, pollution of soil, air, traffic, noise, etc.

Is pollution an urban problem?

Urban pollution is one of the greatest challenges the human species is facing nowadays. Pollution directly influences humansâ€™ health and well-being. In addition, pollution generation and its consequences are usually exacerbated in cities due to population and economic activity density.

How can urban areas reduce pollution?
-------------------------------------

Reduce the number of trips you take in your car. Reduce or eliminate fireplace and wood stove use. Avoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials. Avoid using gas-powered lawn and garden equipment.

How is water pollution a problem in urban areas?
------------------------------------------------

Urban areas have the potential to pollute water in many ways. Runoff from streets carries oil, rubber, heavy metals, and other contaminants from automobiles. Untreated or poorly treated sewage can be low in dissolved oxygen and high in pollutants such as fecal coliform bacteria, nitrates, phosphorus, chemicals, and other bacteria.

How is outdoor air pollution different from indoor air pollution?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Most air pollution is man-made and derives from poor combustion of fossil or biomass fuels (e.g. exhaust fumes from cars, furnaces or wood stoves). Urban outdoor air pollution refers to the air pollution experienced by populations living in and around urban areas (i.e. cities). Indoor air pollution refers to the pollutants found in indoors.

Where does most of the air pollution come from?
-----------------------------------------------

Most air pollution is man-made and derives from poor combustion of fossil or biomass fuels (e.g. exhaust fumes from cars, furnaces or wood stoves). Urban outdoor air pollution refers to the air pollution experienced by populations living in and around urban areas (i.e. cities).
