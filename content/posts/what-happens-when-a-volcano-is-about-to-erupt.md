What happens when a volcano is about to erupt?
----------------------------------------------

Volcanic eruptions are usually heralded by earthquake swarms. They indicate the motion of molten rock beneath the surface. Once an eruption is about to happen, the volcano can spew out lava in two forms, plus ash, and heated gases. Both types of lava carry gases, which they release as they flow.

How much warning before a volcano erupts?
-----------------------------------------

Most scientists think that the buildup preceding a catastrophic eruption would be detectable for weeks and perhaps months to years. Precursors to volcanic eruptions include strong earthquake swarms and rapid ground deformation and typically take place days to weeks before an actual eruption.

What are the signs of a volcanic eruption?
------------------------------------------

WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF A VOLCANIC ERUPTION According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), most volcanoes provide warnings before an eruption. Notable precursors might include: \* An increase in the frequency and intensity of earthquakes

How long does it take for a volcano to erupt?
---------------------------------------------

Before a volcano erupts violently: the warning signs. Volcanological observatories measure activity building up to an eruption — known as precursors — in order to monitor volcanic activity. These destructive volcanoes tend to shake or undergo tremor for hours or minutes before an eruption. But even before tremors, they also can undergo regular,…

What should you do if you get caught in a volcanic eruption?
------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the facts about volcanic eruptions and what you should do if caught in one. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), most volcanoes provide warnings before an eruption. Notable precursors might include:

Can a large earthquake cause a volcano to erupt?
------------------------------------------------

Italy’s Campi Flegrei volcano has been showing signs of unrest for over 60 years. Can earthquakes trigger volcanic eruptions? Sometimes, yes. A few large regional earthquakes (greater than magnitude 6) are considered to be related to a subsequent eruption or to some type of unrest at a nearby volcano.
