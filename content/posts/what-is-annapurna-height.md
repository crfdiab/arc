What is Annapurna height?
-------------------------

Annapurna I  
Annapurna/Highest point

Has anyone climbed Annapurna 3?
-------------------------------

It was first ascended 6 May 1961 by an Indian expedition led by Capt. Mohan Singh Kohli via the Northeast Face. The summit party comprised Mohan Kohli, Sonam Gyatso, and Sonam Girmi. Several teams have attempted to summit Annapurna III via the southeast ridge, however no one has successfully summitted using this route.

Is Annapurna or K2 harder?
--------------------------

K2 is 0.6 km higher than Annapurna, which I think makes it slightly more challenging. So personally I would be slightly more impressed if someone has climbed K2. But really, both of these peaks are mission impossible.

Are there dead bodies on Annapurna?
-----------------------------------

The bodies were found between the south of Mt Annapurna I and Mt Himchuli, at an altitude of 5,500 meters. According to NMA, the bodies are believed to be that of Korean nationals who were killed while climbing in 2009. “Going by their climbing gear, they look like Koreans,” said NMA President Santa Bir Lama.

How many have died on Annapurna?
--------------------------------

Annapurna I has the greatest fatality rate of all the 14 eight-thousanders: as of March 2012, there have been 52 deaths during ascents, 191 successful ascents, and nine deaths upon descent.

Where is Annapurna mountain located in the world?
-------------------------------------------------

The mountain is located in Nepal along a 55-kilometer (34-mile) ridge just east of the Gandaki River, which has carved one of the deepest river gorges in the world. The gorge separates Annapurna from Dhaulagiri, the seventh tallest mountain in the world.

What is the death rate of Annapurna mountain?
---------------------------------------------

That puts Annapurna’s fatality rate at 38%. NASA had a slightly smaller number in 2012, giving the mountain a 32% death rate. This deadly mountain seems to be made deadly because, like many of our past relationships, it’s fairly unstable.

How tall is the south face of Annapurna?
----------------------------------------

The extremely steep south face, a wall of rock that rises 3,000 meters (9,800 feet), is said to be one of the most difficult climbs in the world. Annapurna is the only 8,000 meter-peak to be conquered on the first try—and Herzog and Lachenal did it without bottled oxygen. However, the feat came with a high price.

Who is the photographer of the Annapurna mountain?
