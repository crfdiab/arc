Why are vines common in tropical rainforests?
---------------------------------------------

The vines can sometimes connect trees making it easier for animals to move from tree to tree. Although some different types of trees have adapted in order to discourage liana vines from taking hold, liana vines are a necessary part of the rainforest ecosystem and its health.

Why do plants in the forest have vines?
---------------------------------------

Trees have huge woody trunks that take a lot of time and energy to produce. Vines take advantage of trees, growing quickly on slender stems up into the forest canopy, where their leaves may compete for light with the leaves of the trees that support them.

How did vines adapt to the rainforest?
--------------------------------------

Lianas are climbing woody vines that drape rainforest trees. They have adapted to life in the rainforest by having their roots in the ground and climbing high into the tree canopy to reach available sunlight. Many lianas start life in the rainforest canopy and send roots down to the ground.

What kind of vines grow in the rainforest?
------------------------------------------

Climbing High: The Liana Vines of the Rainforest. Twisty, turning, curvy and climbing — those are just a few ways to describe vines that grow in the rainforest. But check this out: 90 percent of the world’s vine species grow in the rainforest! This species includes the liana vine, one of the most recognizable plant forms in the rainforest.

Why are there so many plants in the rain forest?
------------------------------------------------

Rainforests get a lot of rain — that’s no secret. This means that water isn’t a huge limiting factor for the number of individuals that fit into a given area of the tropical rainforests. Paired with plenty of sunlight, a plant-friendly climate, and lots of 3D space, there’s simply a lot going for rainforest plants.

Why are liana vines important to the rainforest?
------------------------------------------------

In some rainforests, the leaves of the liana vines make up almost 40 percent of that layer’s leaf cover. Liana vines do compete with other plant forms for light. Some scientists believe that the liana vine will take over more and more of the world’s rainforests.

Where do vines and lianas get their leaves from?
------------------------------------------------

Climbing Vine, Borneo 1997 Upon reaching the canopy, vines and lianas spread from tree to tree, and in some forests their leaves may make up 40 percent of canopy leaves. Hemiepiphytes rely on a different strategy. These plants start life in the canopy as epiphytes and grow down to the ground.
