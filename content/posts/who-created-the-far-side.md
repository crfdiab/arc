Why is it called a Thagomizer?
------------------------------

Etymology. The term thagomizer was coined by Gary Larson in jest. In a 1982 The Far Side comic, a group of cavemen in a faux-modern lecture hall are taught by their caveman professor that the spikes on a stegosaur’s tail are so named “after the late Thag Simmons.”

What does the term far side mean?
---------------------------------

1 : the farther side the far side of the lake. 2 or farside \\ ˈfär-​ˌsīd \\ : the side of the moon away from the earth the lunar farside. on the far side of. : beyond just on the far side of 40.

Why can’t we see the other side of moon?
----------------------------------------

As the Earth is much larger than the Moon, the Moon’s rotation is slowed down until it reaches a balance point. As this NASA animation shows (right), this means that the same portion of the Moon always faces towards the Earth, and we can never see the far side.

What are the spikes on a dinosaur back called?
----------------------------------------------

The quadrupedal Stegosaurus is one of the most easily identifiable dinosaur genera, due to the distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates rising vertically along the rounded back and the two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of the tail.

Why do Stegosaurus have plates on their back?
---------------------------------------------

The plates were a temperature-regulation device. If Stegosaurus was, in fact, cold-blooded (as most plant-eating dinosaurs of the Mesozoic Era presumably were), it might have used its plates to soak up light from the sun during the day and dissipate extra body heat at night.
