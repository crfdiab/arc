What is the four deforestation?
-------------------------------

Deforestation affects wild animals, plants and humans in at least four distinct ways: via soil erosion, which can lead to clogged waterways and other problems; via water cycle disruption, which can lead to desertification and habitat loss; via greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global climate change; and via …

What is the most common deforestation?

According to the FAO, Nigeria has the world’s highest deforestation rate of primary forests. It has lost more than half of its primary forest in the last five years. Causes cited are logging, subsistence agriculture, and the collection of fuel wood. Almost 90% of West Africa’s rainforest has been destroyed.

How many deforestation are there?

Globally we deforest around ten million hectares of forest every year. That’s an area the size of Portugal every decade. Around half of this deforestation is offset by regrowing forests, so overall we lose around five million hectares each year. Nearly all – 95% – of this deforestation occurs in the tropics.

How many types of deforestation are there in the world?

How is deforestation a problem in the tropics?

Building or upgrading roads into forests makes them more accessible for exploitation. Slash-and-burn agriculture is a big contributor to deforestation in the tropics. With this agricultural method, farmers burn large swaths of forest, allowing the ash to fertilize the land for crops.

Which is an example of a natural cause of deforestation?
--------------------------------------------------------

In some relatively rare cases, the deforestation of forest areas can be traced to natural causes. For example, volcanic eruptions can burn away the forest lands surrounding the volcano. Other examples of natural deforestation include: Destruction of forests due to hurricanes, floods, and other natural calamities.

How big of a chunk of forest is lost in deforestation?
------------------------------------------------------

Experts estimate that a chunk of forest the size of a soccer field is lost every second to deforestation. Deforestation is the permanent removal of trees to make room for something besides forest. This can include clearing the land for agriculture or grazing, or using the timber for fuel, construction or manufacturing.
