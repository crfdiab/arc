Which igneous rock has the lowest silica content?
-------------------------------------------------

Ultramafic rocks  
Ultramafic rocks have extremely low silica content (less than 45%) and contain large amounts of iron and magnesium. They are usually dark-colored, but high olivine content can lend green shades to the rock. Other rare colors can be found. An example of ultramafic rock is Peridotite (intrusive).

Which has a lower silica content basalt or granite?
---------------------------------------------------

The difference between granites and basalts is in silica content and their rates of cooling. A basalt is about 53% SiO2, whereas granite is 73%.

Does basalt have low silica content?
------------------------------------

Basalt is a hard, black volcanic rock with less than about 52 weight percent silica (SiO2). Because of basalt’s low silica content, it has a low viscosity (resistance to flow). Therefore, basaltic lava can flow quickly and easily move &gt;20 km from a vent.

Is Granite stronger than basalt?
--------------------------------

Basalt weathers faster than granite because it is not as hard and it’s easier for outside substances to impact and manipulate its structure.

What is the most absorbable form of silica?
-------------------------------------------

Orthosilicic acid is the major silica species present in drinking water and other fluids/beverages, including beer, so these provide the most available source of silicon to man. It is readily absorbed and excreted; at least 50% of intake (30, 33, 42, 47, 62, 67).

What kind of rock is the andesite basalt?
-----------------------------------------

Andesite Basalt Granite Peridotite Rhyolite Basalt If a basalt is heated into a partial melt, and the magma produced rises to the surface and cools to form a new rock, what would the new rock type probably be? Andesite Basalt

What kind of rock is a peridotite granite?
------------------------------------------

Peridotite Granite If a peridotite is heated into a partial melt, and the magma produced rises to the surface and cools to form a new rock, what would the new rock type probably be? Andesite Basalt

Which is the coarse grained equivalent of basalt?
-------------------------------------------------

Rhyolite Rhyolite Which rock is the coarse-grained equivalent of basalt (same composition but phaneritic)? Diorite. Gabbro. Granite. Peridotite.

What are the different types of igneous rocks?
----------------------------------------------

Composition of igneous rocks (silicic, intermediate, mafic, ultramafic) – Silicic (granite, rhyolite) – Intermediate (diorite, andesite) – Mafic (gabbro, basalt) – Ultramafic (peridotite, komatiite) – Combination of texture and composition produces rock name
