Is the island of Curacao part of the Netherlands?
-------------------------------------------------

Curacao is an island located in the Lesser Antilles in the Southern Caribbean Sea. It is part of the Dutch Caribbean region alongside other islands that are also found on this side of the world. Many people often wonder whether Curacao is a country or not, as the political status of this island is very confusing to some.

Who is the head of State in Curacao?
------------------------------------

Even though Curacao is a constituent country that belongs to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, it still has its own Prime Minister, so the political situation is that they have a parliamentary representative democracy. The King of the Netherlands is, of course, the Head of State, who is represented in Curacao by a Governor.

When did Curacao become part of the British Empire?
---------------------------------------------------

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the British attacked the island several times, most notably in 1800, 1804, and the period from 1807 to 1815. Stable Dutch rule returned in 1815 at the end of the Napoleonic wars, when the island was incorporated into the colony of Curaçao and Dependencies.

Are there any overseas dependencies of the Netherlands?
-------------------------------------------------------

Aruba, Curaçao and St Maarten are not overseas dependencies of the Netherlands, but instead autonomous partners within the Kingdom, alongside the country of the Netherlands. Bonaire, Saba and St Eustatius have the status of public bodies (within the meaning of the Dutch Constitution).
