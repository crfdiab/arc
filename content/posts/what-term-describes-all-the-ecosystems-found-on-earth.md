What term describes all the ecosystems found on Earth?
------------------------------------------------------

of organisms together with their physical environment. To Cole, the ecosphere is the global ecosystem, ‘the sum total of life on earth together with the global environment and the earth’s total resources’ (Cole, 1958; p.

What is called ecosphere?
-------------------------

The ecosphere (also sometimes called the ‘biosphere’) is that part of the Earth’s environment in which living organisms are found. The word is normally used to include the atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere (i.e. land, air and water that support living things).

What is biosphere short?
------------------------

The part of the Earth system comprising all ecosystems and living organisms, in the atmosphere, on land (terrestrial biosphere) or in the oceans (marine biosphere), including derived dead organic matter, such as litter, soil organic matter and oceanic detritus.

What is ecosphere with example?
-------------------------------

An ecosphere is the area of a planet where life-forms can live and includes all the physical features and chemical reactions that support life in the area. Ecospheres are closed, or self-sustaining, systems. An example of this closed, or self-sustaining, system is Earth’s ecosphere.

What is ecosphere give an example?
----------------------------------

An ecosphere is a planetary closed ecological system. For instance, Earth’s ecosphere consists of five primary component spheres which are the Geosphere, Hydrosphere, Biosphere, Atmosphere, and Magnetosphere.

What are the different types of ecosystems on Earth?
----------------------------------------------------

The major types of ecosystems are forest, desert, rain forest, grassland, tundra, savanna and mountain ecosystem. The atmosphere in the rain forest regions is very adorable. This ecosystem is covered with lush green views all around this region. The excessive rainfall provides a dense environment in the rain forest ecosystem.

How is the surface of the earth connected to an ecosystem?
----------------------------------------------------------

The whole surface of Earth is a series of connected ecosystems. Ecosystems are often connected in a larger biome. Biomes are large sections of land, sea, or atmosphere. Forest s, ponds, reef s, and tundra are all types of biomes, for example. They’re organized very generally, based on the types of plants and animals that live in them.

Which is a biotic component of an ecosystem?
--------------------------------------------

The ecosystem: a complex system. An ecosystem is a complex system composed of organisms living in a given habitat. Plants and animals are the biotic components of the ecosystem, while the subsoil, water, air, light, temperature, the climate, rains are part of the abiotic components.

Which is the most important ecosystem on Earth?
-----------------------------------------------

The forest ecosystem is one of the crucial terrestrial ecosystems that provide shelter to thousands of plant &amp; animal species.
