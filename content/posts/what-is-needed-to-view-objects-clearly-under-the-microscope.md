What is needed to view objects clearly under the microscope?
------------------------------------------------------------

A combination of magnification and resolution is necessary to clearly view specimens under the microscope. The light microscope bends a beam of light at the specimen using a series of lenses to provide a clear image of the specimen to the observer.

What do you need to see in a microscope?
----------------------------------------

Here are 50 easy-to-find things to view under a microscope.

1. Salt (including different types)
2. Sugar.
3. Sand (compare from different beaches, if possible)
4. Bird seed.
5. Different colors of human hair (be sure to look at dyed and natural, and roots)
6. Fur from various species.
7. Whiskers.
8. Onion skin.

What are the basic steps to using a microscope?
-----------------------------------------------

Steps on How to Use a Light Microscope

1. Step 1: Connect the light microscope to a power source.
2. Step 2: Turn the revolving nosepiece so the lowest objective lens is in position.
3. Step 3: Mount your specimen onto the stage.
4. Step 4: Use the metal clips to keep your slide in place.

What are the basic microscope techniques and rules to follow?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Important general rules: Always carry the microscope with 2 hands—place one hand on the microscope arm and the other hand under the microscope base. Do not touch the objective lenses (i.e. the tips of the objectives). Keep the objectives in the scan position and keep the stage low when adding or removing slides.

How does a microscope make an enlarged image of a tiny object?
--------------------------------------------------------------

A simple light microscope manipulates how light enters the eye using a convex lens, where both sides of the lens are curved outwards. When light reflects off of an object being viewed under the microscope and passes through the lens, it bends towards the eye. This makes the object look bigger than it actually is.

Why must you never touch the lens of a microscope with your fingers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Never touch the lenses with your fingers. Your body produces an oil that smudges the glass. This oil can even etch the glass if left on too long. Use only LENS PAPER to clean the glass.

How do you see hair under a microscope?
---------------------------------------

Procedure

1. Place a drop of water at the center of a microscope glass slide.
2. Using a pair of forceps, place a few strands of hair onto the drop of water (or any other mountant used)
3. Place the slide under the microscope and observe under low and high power.
4. Compare different types of hair under the microscope.

Which type of microscope is best?
---------------------------------

With two lenses, the compound microscope offers better magnification than a simple microscope; the second lens magnifies the image of the first. Compound microscopes are bright field microscopes, meaning that the specimen is lit from underneath, and they can be binocular or monocular.

What are the 3 rules of microscopy?
-----------------------------------

Do not touch the glass part of the lenses with your fingers. Use only special lens paper to clean the lenses. Always keep your microscope covered when not in use. Always carry a microscope with both hands.

What’s the maximum field of view for a microscope?
--------------------------------------------------

In early microscope objectives, the maximum usable field diameter tended to be about 18 millimeters or considerably less, but with modern plan apochromats and other specialized flat-field objectives, the maximum usable field can sometimes exceed 28 millimeters. Exploring the effect of varying the field of view size on the viewable specimen area.

What are the different types of microscope preparation?
-------------------------------------------------------

There are two basic types of preparation used to view specimens with a light microscope: wet mounts and fixed specimens. The simplest type of preparation is the wet mount, in which the specimen is placed on the slide in a drop of liquid.

What are the steps in setting up a microscope?
----------------------------------------------

All of the following are steps in setting up the microscope in order to view a specimen EXCEPT \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. All of the following are correct steps in focusing on a specimen under the microscope EXCEPT which statement? Start with a high power objective lens when focusing.

What kind of microscope is used in a clinical setting?
------------------------------------------------------

In clinical settings, light microscopes are the most commonly used microscopes. There are two basic types of preparation used to view specimens with a light microscope: wet mounts and fixed specimens.
