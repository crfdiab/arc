Does the Moon have a thick or thin atmosphere?
----------------------------------------------

The moon’s atmosphere An extremely thin atmosphere of gas blankets the moon, consisting of only 100 molecules per cubic centimeter. In comparison, the Earth’s atmosphere at sea level has around a billion billion times more molecules per cubic centimeter. The total mass of all lunar gases is about 55,000 lbs.

Did the Moon have a thick atmosphere?
-------------------------------------

In October 2017, NASA scientists at the Marshall Space Flight Center and the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston announced their finding, based on studies of Moon magma samples retrieved by the Apollo missions, that the Moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of 70 million years between …

Why is the Moon’s atmosphere thin?
----------------------------------

There are other factors, too. Some moons have a thin atmosphere because they have some internal heat and thus volcanoes and geysers that can replenish their very thin atmospheres. Then there is Venus, where it got so hot (what is called a runaway greenhouse) that some of the rocks have boiled away.

What is the Moon’s atmosphere mostly made of?
---------------------------------------------

The three primary gases in the lunar atmosphere are neon, helium, and hydrogen, in roughly equal amounts. Small amounts of methane, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and water were also detected. In addition, argon-40 was detected, and its abundance increased at times of high seismic activity.

When was the atmosphere of the Moon thick?
------------------------------------------

In October 2017, NASA scientists at the Marshall Space Flight Center and the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston announced their finding, based on studies of Moon magma samples retrieved by the Apollo missions, that the Moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of 70 million years between 3 and 4 billion years ago.

How is the atmosphere of the Moon different from that of the Earth?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the critical differences between the atmospheres of Earth and the moon is how atmospheric molecules move. Here in the dense atmosphere at the surface of Earth, the molecules’ motion is dominated by collisions between the molecules. However the moon’s atmosphere is so thin, atoms and molecules almost never collide.

Is the Earth’s atmosphere bigger than we thought?
-------------------------------------------------

But Earth’s atmosphere is way more complicated than that (there’s even some debate about where the Kármán line should be). Now a team of astronomers has discovered that it’s bigger than we even thought – extending all the way out to the Moon, and as far again. The region is called the geocorona, part of an atmospheric layer called the exosphere.

Is there any evidence of life on the Moon?
------------------------------------------

Ancient atmosphere. It has been theorized, in fact, that this ancient atmosphere could have supported life, though no evidence of life has been found. The ancient lunar atmosphere was eventually stripped away by solar winds and dissipated into space.
