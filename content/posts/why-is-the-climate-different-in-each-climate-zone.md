Why is the climate different in each climate zone?

Climate zones are areas with distinct climates, which occur in east-west direction around the Earth, and can be classified using different climatic parametres. Due to temperature differences caused by the differences in radiation, recurring climatic conditions develop, such as winter and summer. …

Why are their three main climate zones?
---------------------------------------

An air mass is a large body of air that has about the same temperature, humidity (moisture), and pressure across it. The Earth has three main climate zones: tropical, temperate, and polar. The North and South poles have climates that are polar because of nearby cold air masses.

What are several different types of climates?

Global climates are often divided into five types: tropical, dry, temperate, cold and polar. These climate divisions take a variety of factors into consideration, including altitude, pressure, wind patterns, latitude and geographical characteristics, such as mountains and oceans.

How are the three types of climate related?
-------------------------------------------

The climate depends on several interrelated factors: latitude, longitude, elevation, topography, proximity to the sea and wind direction. Therefore, although the areas located near the equator are usually warm, there are mountain zones on the same latitude that are cold. In general, there are three types of climate: warm, temperate, and polar.
