How do tides change daily?
--------------------------

Because the Earth rotates through two tidal “bulges” every lunar day, coastal areas experience two high and two low tides every 24 hours and 50 minutes. Since the Earth rotates through two tidal “bulges” every lunar day, we experience two high and two low tides every 24 hours and 50 minutes.

What are daily tides affected by?
---------------------------------

The relative distances and positions of the sun, moon and Earth all affect the size and magnitude of the Earth’s two tidal bulges. At a smaller scale, the magnitude of tides can be strongly influenced by the shape of the shoreline.

What has the biggest effect on the tide?
----------------------------------------

The major tidal constituent is the moon’s gravitational pull on the Earth. The closer objects are, the greater the gravitational force is between them. Although the sun and moon both exert gravitational force on the Earth, the moon’s pull is stronger because the moon is much closer to the Earth than the sun is.

How do tides affect the length of a day?
----------------------------------------

What effect have tides had on the length of a day. Answer. Tides do place a drag on the earth’s rotation, but gradually. This energy lost from the earth’s rotation is picked up by the moon’s orbit around the earth. The moon is receding from the earth.

What happens to the Sun and Moon during spring tides?
-----------------------------------------------------

In the period between the two spring tides, the moon faces the Earth at a right angle to the sun. When this happens, the pull of the sun and the moon are weak.

How does the shape of the continental margin affect the tides?
--------------------------------------------------------------

When oceanic tidal bulges hit wide continental margins, the height of the tides can be magnified. Conversely, mid-oceanic islands not near continental margins typically experience very small tides of 1 meter or less (Thurman, H.V., 1994). The shape of bays and estuaries also can magnify the intensity of tides.

What causes high tides and low water levels?
--------------------------------------------

Strong offshore winds can move water away from coastlines, exaggerating low tide exposures. Onshore winds may act to pile up water onto the shoreline, virtually eliminating low tide exposures. High – pressure systems can depress sea levels, leading to clear sunny days with exceptionally low tides.
