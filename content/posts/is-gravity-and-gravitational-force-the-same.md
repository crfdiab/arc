Is gravity and gravitational force the same?
--------------------------------------------

The major difference between gravitation and gravity is that gravitational force occurs between two different or the same objects. While the force of gravity acts between the earth surface and any object. The force of gravitation acting between two objects is quite weaker as compared to the force of gravity.

Is gravity different at the North Pole?
---------------------------------------

The effective acceleration of gravity at the poles is 980.665 cm/sec/sec while at the equator it is 3.39 cm/sec/sec less due to the centrifugal force. If you weighed 100 pounds at the north pole on a spring scale, at the equator you would weigh 99.65 pounds, or 5.5 ounces less.

Is gravitational force different in different places?
-----------------------------------------------------

Gravity is often assumed to be the same everywhere on Earth, but it varies because the planet is not perfectly spherical or uniformly dense. In addition, gravity is weaker at the equator due to centrifugal forces produced by the planet’s rotation.

Is gravitational force the same on all bodies?
----------------------------------------------

Every object in the universe that has mass exerts a gravitational pull, or force, on every other mass. The size of the pull depends on the masses of the objects. You exert a gravitational force on the people around you, but that force isn’t very strong, since people aren’t very massive.

Is there more gravity around the equator than around the Poles?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Since due to the geometry of the earth its has more radius in equator and less radius in poles . So there is more g in poles than in the equator . Hence gravity is more at the poles tha n equator. So no the gravity is less in equator as compared to poles. No. Slightly slightly less due to the faster rotation of the Earth.

What’s the difference between gravity and the gravitational force?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Gravity is the more common name used for the concept of gravitational field. Gravitational field is a concept of a vector field. The gravitational field is in radial outward direction from the mass. It is measured as GM/r 2. G is the universal gravitational constant, having the value of 6.674 x 10-11 Newton meter 2 per kilogram 2.

What is the formula for gravity at the Poles?
---------------------------------------------

The following table compares what a spherical gravity model less centrifugal acceleration predicts for gravitational acceleration at sea level at the equator ( g eq) and the north pole ( g p) versus the values computed using the well-established Somigliana gravity formula g = g eq ( 1 + κ sin 2 λ.

Why is Earth’s gravity so strong?
---------------------------------

Many sources state that the Earth’s gravity is stronger at the poles than the equator for two reasons: The centrifugal “force” cancels out the gravity minimally, more so at the equator than at the poles. The poles are closer to the center due to the equatorial bulge, and thus have a stronger gravitational field.
