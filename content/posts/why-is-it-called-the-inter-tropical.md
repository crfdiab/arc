Why is it called the Inter tropical?
------------------------------------

As trans-equator sea voyages became more common, sailors in the eighteenth century named this belt of calm the doldrums because of the calm, stagnant, or inactive winds.

What is the ITCZ in Africa?
---------------------------

The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) has. long been assumed to be a major control on tropical rainfall over both oceans and land. Over Africa, the cycle of the rainfall seasons is generally associated with its north–south displacement as this zone “follows” the sun.

What is inter tropical location?
--------------------------------

The Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, is the region that circles the Earth, near the equator, where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres come together. The intense sun and warm water of the equator heats the air in the ITCZ, raising its humidity and making it buoyant.

What is ICT Z?
--------------

The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, is a belt of low pressure which circles the Earth generally near the equator where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres come together. It is characterised by convective activity which generates often vigorous thunderstorms over large areas.

What causes the ITCZ to move?
-----------------------------

The shifting of ITCZ is the result of the Earth’s rotation, axis inclination and the translation of Earth around the Sun. Seasons are the result of this. ITCZ moves toward the hemisphere with most heat, wich are either hemisphere summers.

Where is ITCZ today?
--------------------

In eastern Asia, the ITCZ may propagate up to 30 degrees north of the Equator. In January, over the Atlantic, the ITCZ generally sits no further south than the Equator, but extends much further south over South America, Southern Africa, and Australia.

What is the full form of ITCZ?
------------------------------

ITCZ stands for Intertropical Convergence Zone. It is an area between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere where winds converge from the mid-latitudes blowing equator-ward and winds flowing poleward from the tropics.

What causes ITCZ to shift?
--------------------------

What is ITCZ Class 9 Ncert?
---------------------------

The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ,) is a broad trough of low pressure in equatorial latitudes. This is where the northeast and the southeast trade winds converge.

What makes tropical Africa different from the tropics?
------------------------------------------------------

Tropical Africa. Although tropical Africa is mostly familiar to the West for its rainforests, this ecozone of Africa is far more diverse. While the tropics are thought of as regions with warm to hot moist climates caused by latitude and the tropical rain belt, the geology of areas, particularly mountain chains,…

How does the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone work?
--------------------------------------------------

Definition The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, is a belt of low pressure which circles the Earth generally near the equator where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres come together. It is characterised by convective activity which generates often vigorous thunderstorms over large areas.

Where does most of the precipitation in Africa come from?
---------------------------------------------------------

Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding the East African coast) gets its precipitation from tropical moist oceanic air that moves from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans toward an equatorial low pressure zone. This area is the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ).

How does the ITCZ influence the climate of Africa?
--------------------------------------------------

\*How does the ITCZ and its associated air masses influence the climate of Africa? The ITCZ shifts position throughout the year in relation to the apparent movement of the sun because of the way the earth sits on its axis. In July The sun is directly overhead the Tropic of Cancer due to the tilt of the earth.
