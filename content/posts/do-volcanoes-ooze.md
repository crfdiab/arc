Do volcanoes ooze?
------------------

Some, like Mount St. Helens, burst violently and send ash and gas high into the air. Others, like Kilauea in Hawaii, ooze red hot lava which runs like maple syrup down the slope of the volcano. Many factors control how a volcano will erupt.

What type of volcano does not explode?
--------------------------------------

Shield volcanoes are built by many layers over time and the layers are usually of very similar composition. The low viscosity also means that shield eruptions are non-explosive.

What do you call the smoke from volcano?
----------------------------------------

A fumarole (or fumerole – the word ultimately comes from the Latin fumus, “smoke”) is an opening in a planet’s crust which emits steam and gases such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen sulfide.

What happens when a cinder cone volcano erupts?
-----------------------------------------------

These fragments include pyroclastic material, cinders, volcanic ash, scoria, etc. Cinder cone volcanoes can erupt spectacularly shooting lava and volcanic ash high into the air. From hurricanes to earthquakes and volcanoes, there are many natural disasters that humans face while attempting to shape the world.

Is the cinder cone volcano friendly to humans?
----------------------------------------------

A look at some of the most recently active cinder cone volcanoes would that they are ‘relatively friendly’ in nature.

How big was the cinder cone volcano in Mexico?
----------------------------------------------

One of the most famous cinder cone volcanoes erupted out of a Mexican corn field in 1943. The volcano erupted for 9 years, and quickly built up the cinder cone to 424 meters, and covered 25 km2 of fields in lava flows and rubble. Nearby towns were eventually buried in ash by the eruptions.

What kind of rock is ejected from a cinder cone?
------------------------------------------------

The names “ejecta” and “tephra” and “pyroclastics” are all used for the rock fragments blown from a cinder cone or other type of volcano during an explosive eruption. Many scientists use the terminology in the accompanying table when they talk or write about materials ejected from a cinder cone or other type of volcanic eruption.
