How a location on the globe is identified using latitude and longitude coordinates?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The combination of meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude establishes a framework or grid by means of which exact positions can be determined in reference to the prime meridian and the Equator: a point described as 40° N, 30° W, for example, is located 40° of arc north of the Equator and 30° of arc west of …

How does latitude and longitude help determine a location?
----------------------------------------------------------

When used together, longitude and latitude define a specific location through geographical coordinates. Longitude and latitude lines measure the distance from the Earth’s Equator or central axis – running east to west – and the Prime Meridian in Greenwich, England – running north to south.

How do you write location coordinates?
--------------------------------------

Write the latitude and longitude coordinates. When writing latitude and longitude, write latitude first, followed by a comma, and then longitude. For example, the above lines of latitude and longitude would be written as “15°N, 30°E.”

How does the latitude and longitude system work?
------------------------------------------------

The geographic coordinate system is a geographic system that uses latitude and longitude to specify locations on the globe. Latitude defines how far north or south a point is on the globe relative to the equator.

Where can I find the exact coordinates of my location?
------------------------------------------------------

Turn on the coordinates grid. To see an exact location, you can use the coordinates on the map grid: In the upper menu bar, click View Grid. Ctrl + n (Windows) or ⌘+ L (Mac). The grid lines are marked with general coordinates. Exact longitude and latitude readings are in the lower right corner.

Which is a part of the geographic coordinate system?
----------------------------------------------------

Usually just referred to as the GCS, the geographic coordinate system is probably rather familiar to most of us. With this in mind, let’s break down the parts of the GCS. We’ll start with latitude and longitude, the very concepts my cool teacher let us use our cool mini-globes to learn about.

How to know the latitude and longitude of the Earth?
----------------------------------------------------

The earth is divided up into 180 latitude lines on either side of the equator, called parallels. These parallels run horizontally around the earth, parallel to the equator. 90 of them are north of the equator, while the other 90 are south of it. 2 Learn the definition of longitude.
