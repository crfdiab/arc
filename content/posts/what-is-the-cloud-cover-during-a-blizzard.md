What is the cloud cover during a blizzard?
------------------------------------------

Clouds that produce precipitation as rain or snow are called frontal cirrostratus, altostratus and nimbostratus clouds. Nimbostratus clouds produce the most intense precipitation but don’t produce all the elements that constitute a blizzard. High winds and low temperatures are also required.

How are storm clouds formed?
----------------------------

Thunderstorms form when warm, moist air rises into cold air. The warm air becomes cooler, which causes moisture, called water vapor, to form small water droplets – a process called condensation. This circuit of rising and falling air is called a convection cell. If this happens a small amount, a cloud will form.

Are Arcus clouds dangerous?
---------------------------

Arcus clouds pose no direct danger in the form of precipitation or strong winds, but in many cases, act as a precursor for approaching thunderstorms and severe weather.

How are blizzards formed and what causes them?
----------------------------------------------

Warm, rising air is needed to form clouds and cause precipitation. For a blizzard to form, warm air must rise over cold air. There are two ways that this may happen. Winds pull cold air toward the equator from the poles and bring warm air toward the poles from the equator.

How long does it take for a blizzard to form?
---------------------------------------------

The National Weather Service of the United States defines a blizzard as a storm with winds of more than 56 km (35 miles) per hour for at least three hours and enough snow to limit visibility to 0.4 km (0.25 mile) or less.

Why is warm air important for forming clouds?
---------------------------------------------

Warm, rising air is important for forming clouds. Blizzard can form only if the warm air rises over the cold air. That can happen in two circumstances. The wind brings a cold air to the Equator from the poles and bringing warm air to poles. When warm air and cold air are brought together, a front is formed and rainfall happens.
