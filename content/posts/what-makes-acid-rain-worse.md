What makes acid rain worse?
---------------------------

Power plants release the majority of sulfur dioxide and much of the nitrogen oxides when they burn fossil fuels, such as coal, to produce electricity. In addition, the exhaust from cars, trucks, and buses releases nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide into the air. These pollutants cause acid rain.

What are the two negative effects of acid rain?
-----------------------------------------------

The ecological effects of acid rain are most clearly seen in aquatic environments, such as streams, lakes, and marshes where it can be harmful to fish and other wildlife. As it flows through the soil, acidic rain water can leach aluminum from soil clay particles and then flow into streams and lakes.

How is acid rain harmful to the environment?
--------------------------------------------

On the other hand, acid rain also causes corrosion of metallic elements -buildings, bridges, towers and other structures- and the destruction of human heritage made of limestone -buildings and historic structures, statues, sculptures… – Is acid rain harmful to humans?

How does acid rain affect the hydrosphere?
------------------------------------------

Acid precipitation can cause direct damage to the foliage on plants especially when the precipitation is in the form of fog or cloud water which is up to ten times more acidic than rainfall. Dry deposition of SO2 and NOx has been found to affect the ability of leaves to retain water when they are under water stress.

Why is acid rain back in the United States?
-------------------------------------------

Acid rain is back, and thanks to farming, worse than ever. Agri-ammonia vapors also derive from concentrated animal feeding operations in the U.S. South. The gas rises into the air and is deposited dry or in rainfall where in the ground bacteria breaks it into nitrogen and nitric acid, which can kill fish and plants.

What is the pH level of acid rain?
----------------------------------

Precipitation is considered to be acidic when its pH falls below 5.6 (which is 25 times more acidic than pure distilled water). Some sites in eastern North America have precipitation events with pHs as low as 2.3 or about 1000 times more acidic than natural.
