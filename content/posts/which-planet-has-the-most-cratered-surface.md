Which planet has the most cratered surface?
-------------------------------------------

Mercury  
Why does Mercury have more craters than the other planets? All of the planets in our Solar System have had a lot of craters. This was especially true in the past when there were many more asteroids traveling in our solar system than there are today.

Does Mars have a cratered surface?
----------------------------------

The surface of Mars is covered with impact craters, bowl-shaped depressions that are created when an asteroid or comet collides with a planetary surface. Scientists estimate that on Mars, there are more than 43,000 impact craters with diameters greater than 5 kilometers (3 miles).

Does Jupiter have craters?
--------------------------

Most of them are cratered, such as Europa, one of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter. Europa’s surface is thought to consist of a thick layer of ice overlaying a liquid water ocean.

Why is Callisto so heavily cratered?
------------------------------------

Callisto also had low reflectivity (albedo) and was known to have a low density, but astronomers saw no evidence of water emissions. This led them to conclude that Callisto had a rocky surface.

Can humans live on Callisto?
----------------------------

Callisto has a very thin atmosphere, is thought to contain an ocean, and is therefore another possible contender for life beyond Earth. However, its distance from Jupiter means it doesn’t experience such a strong gravitational pull, so it’s not as geologically active as the other Galilean moons of Io and Europa.

Why is Mars full of craters?
----------------------------

Impact craters are caused when a bolide collides with a planet. The Martian surface contains thousands of impact craters because, unlike Earth, Mars has a stable crust, low erosion rate, and no active sources of lava. So, impact craters on Mars are not obliterated as they are on Earth.

Is there volcanoes on Mars?
---------------------------

“Mars has a number of giant volcanoes, including nearby Elysium Mons, but this eruption and the volcanic fissures it is associated with are in an otherwise featureless plain,” Andrews-Hanna added.

How many craters are there on the Moon?
---------------------------------------

But we can see many thousands of craters on the Moon and we only know of about 180 on Earth! Why is that? The truth is both the Earth and the Moon have been hit many, many times throughout their long 4.5 billion year history. This view of the Moon’s cratered South Pole was seen by NASA’s Clementine spacecraft in 1996.

Why are there so many craters on the Earth?
-------------------------------------------

The second thing is something called tectonics. Tectonics are processes that cause our planet’s surface to form new rocks, get rid of old rocks, and shift around over millions of years. Because of tectonics, the surface of Earth is recycled many times throughout its long history.

Which is the hottest planet in our Solar System?
------------------------------------------------

From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.

What’s the difference between the Earth and the Moon?
-----------------------------------------------------

The main difference between the two is that Earth has processes that can erase almost all evidence of past impacts. The moon does not. Pretty much any tiny dent made on the moon’s surface is going to stay there. Three processes help Earth keep its surface crater free.
