Do convergent boundaries create mountains and volcanoes?
--------------------------------------------------------

When subduction occurs, a chain of volcanoes often develops near the convergent plate boundary. One such chain of volcanoes can be found on the western coast of the United States, spanning across the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. A divergent plate boundary often forms a mountain chain known as a ridge.

What causes mountains and volcanoes to form?
--------------------------------------------

Volcanic mountains form when molten rock from deep inside the Earth erupts through the crust and piles up on itself. The islands of Hawaii were formed by undersea volcanoes, and the islands seen above water today are the remaining volcano tops.

Why are mountains most likely to form at a convergent boundary?
---------------------------------------------------------------

They are created at convergent plate boundaries, sometimes called continental collision zones or compression zones. Convergent plate boundaries are sites of collisions, where tectonic plates crash into each other. For this reason, most fold mountains are found on the edge or former edge of continental plate boundaries.

How do convergent boundaries make mountains?
--------------------------------------------

Mountains are usually formed at what are called convergent plate boundaries, meaning a boundary at which two plates are moving towards one another. Sometimes, the two tectonic plates press up against each other, causing the land to lift into mountainous forms as the plates continue to collide.

How are volcanoes formed at convergent plate boundaries?
--------------------------------------------------------

If two tectonic plates collide, they form a convergent plate boundary. Usually, one of the converging plates will move beneath the other, a process known as subduction. The new magma (molten rock) rises and may erupt violently to form volcanoes, often building arcs of islands along the convergent boundary. Click to see full answer

Which is an example of a convergent boundary?
---------------------------------------------

The Cascade Mountain Range is a line of volcanoes above the melting oceanic plate. The Andes Mountain Range of western South America is another example of a convergent boundary between an oceanic and continental plate. Here the Nazca Plate is subducting beneath the South American plate.

Why are the Cascades at a plate boundary?
-----------------------------------------

The Cascades are a chain of volcanoes at a convergent boundary where an oceanic plate is subducting beneath a continental plate. Specifically the volcanoes are the result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca, Gorda, and Explorer Plates beneath North America.

What happens when two tectonic plates collide?
----------------------------------------------

A convergent plate boundary is a location where two tectonic plates are moving toward each other, often causing one plate to slide below the other (in a process known as subduction). The collision of tectonic plates can result in earthquakes, volcanoes, the formation of mountains, and other geological events.
