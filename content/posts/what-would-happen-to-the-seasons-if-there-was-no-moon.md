What would happen to the seasons if there was no moon?
------------------------------------------------------

It is the pull of the Moon’s gravity on the Earth that holds our planet in place. Without the Moon stabilising our tilt, it is possible that the Earth’s tilt could vary wildly. It would move from no tilt (which means no seasons) to a large tilt (which means extreme weather and even ice ages).

Does moon affect seasons?
-------------------------

The Moon’s Influence The Earth’s axis is tilted at 23.5 degrees from the ecliptic. That angle is responsible for the seasons. But the tilt angle is not fixed. The moon’s gravitational pull on the Earth causes precession — a small, 21,000-year cyclic change in the angle of the Earth’s tilt.

What if the Moon blew up?
-------------------------

If the moon exploded, the night sky would change. We would see more stars in the sky, but we would also see more meteors and experience more meteorites. The position of the Earth in space would change and temperatures and seasons would dramatically alter, and our ocean tides would be much weaker.

Why is the Moon important?
--------------------------

The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet’s wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years.

What is a moon season?
----------------------

But the moon’s axis is tilted by only about 1.5 degrees, so the moon doesn’t experience noticeable seasons. This means that some areas are always lit by sunlight, and other places are perpetually draped in shadow.

Could the moon hit the earth?
-----------------------------

Scientists have long agreed that the Moon formed when a protoplanet, called Theia, struck Earth in its infancy some 4.5 billion years ago. Now, a team of scientists has a provocative new proposal: Theia’s remains can be found in two continent-size layers of rock buried deep in Earth’s mantle.

What happens to the Earth if there is no moon?
----------------------------------------------

There is also evidence that the moon stabilises the earths tilt. If there was no moon then the tilt of the earths axis may be different causing different and other new seasons. There is also a theory that if there was no moon the earth wouldn’t have a tilt.

What happens to the Earth if there are no seasons?
--------------------------------------------------

If the Earth weren’t tilted on its axis, there would be no seasons. And humanity would suffer. When a Mars-size object collided with Earth 4.5 billion years ago, it knocked off a chunk that would become the moon. It also tilted Earth sideways a bit, so that our planet now orbits the sun on a slant. Those were two huge changes.

Is it possible to have a seasonless Earth?
------------------------------------------

Fortunately, as things are, Earth’s tropical zones tend to have minimal temperature and day-length variability over the course of the year, and so these regions can serve as archetypes for what a seasonless Earth might be like. RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU…

How does the moon affect the Earth’s axis?
------------------------------------------

Right now, thanks to our moon, our axis stays tilted at twenty-three point five degrees. But without the moon the earth might tilt too far over or hardly tilt at all leading to no seasons or even extreme seasons.
