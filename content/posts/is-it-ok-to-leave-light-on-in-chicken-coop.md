How can I increase my roosters fertility?

Drinking water containing lycopene (5.0 g/L) improved the fertility of roosters by enhancing the semen volume as well as the live sperm content and viability (Mangiagalli et al., 2010).

Should chickens have a light on at night?
-----------------------------------------

Chickens do not need light at night. They require at least 6 to 8 hours of darkness to get a good night’s sleep. This downtime is imperative to the chicken’s health and well-being, just as much as daylight or artificial light for 12 to 14 hours per day is critical for laying eggs.
