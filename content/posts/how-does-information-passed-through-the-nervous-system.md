How does information passed through the nervous system?
-------------------------------------------------------

Nervous system messages travel through neurons as electrical signals. When these signals reach the end of a neuron, they stimulate the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters travel across synapses, spaces between neurons or between neurons and other body tissues and cells.

How do nerve cells communicate?
-------------------------------

Neurons communicate with each other via electrical events called ‘action potentials’ and chemical neurotransmitters. At the junction between two neurons (synapse), an action potential causes neuron A to release a chemical neurotransmitter.

What part of nerve cell receives messages?
------------------------------------------

Dendrites  
A neuron has three main parts. The cell body directs all activities of the neuron. Dendrites extend out from the cell body and receive messages from other nerve cells. An axon is a long single fiber that transmits messages from the cell body to the dendrites of other neurons or to other body tissues, such as muscles.

Why are nerve cells important?
------------------------------

Neurons are responsible for carrying information throughout the human body. Using electrical and chemical signals, they help coordinate all of the necessary functions of life.

How do I know if my nervous system is damaged?
----------------------------------------------

A few examples of symptoms that may be caused by a nervous system problem include: Numbness or tingling. Weakness or a reduced ability to move any part of the body (not caused by pain). Tremors, tics, or other unusual movements, such as a walking (gait) change or mouth smacking.

What is the gap between nerve cells called?
-------------------------------------------

Synapse, also called neuronal junction, the site of transmission of electric nerve impulses between two nerve cells (neurons) or between a neuron and a gland or muscle cell (effector). A synaptic connection between a neuron and a muscle cell is called a neuromuscular junction.

What function does nerve cells perform?
---------------------------------------

Cell — Structure and Functions | Exercise The nerve cell(neuron) receives and transfers messages, thereby helping to control and coordinate the working of different parts of the body.

How is a message sent from one neuron to another?
-------------------------------------------------

In order for a message to be sent from one neuron to another, it must cross the synapse. The synapse is a junction between the axon terminals of one neuron and the dendrites of another neuron. Messages are received by the dendrites and travel through the cell body and the axon to the axon terminals.

How does the nerve impulse travel along the neuron?
---------------------------------------------------

Like many other cells, a neuron has a cell body, including a nucleus. But a neuron also includes many dendrites as well as an axon. Dendrites are the receptors on a neuron that receive messages from other cells, and an axon sends the message along to the other cells.

How do messages travel to and from the brain?
---------------------------------------------

Messages are received by the dendrites and travel through the cell body and the axon to the axon terminals. How do messages travel to and from the brain? Explain how messages travel to and from the brain through the nervous system.

How are signals transmitted in the nervous system?
--------------------------------------------------

The dendrites of the first neuron in the signal chain receives the stimulus and transmit the signal through the axon. Once through the axon the signal travels down each axon terminal. When the signal reaches the terminal it causes the release of synaptic vesicles that carry a neurotransmitter (chemical messengers).
