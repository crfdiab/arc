Where do plants store their water?
----------------------------------

vacuoles  
Plants store water in sacs, called vacuoles, in their cells. When the vacuole is full of water, the cells are rigid and firm.

What plant helps store water?
-----------------------------

Succulent plants store water in fleshy leaves, stems or roots. All cacti are succulents, as are such non-cactus desert dwellers as agave, aloe, elephant trees, and many euphorbias. Several other adaptations are essential for the water storing habit to be effective.

Where do plants store water and nutrients?
------------------------------------------

Multiple other layers of the root help screen nutrients and water, store them and direct them through the vascular system of the plant for further use. After plants absorb the water and nutrients through their roots, they transfer them through the vascular system up to the rest of the plant.

How do plants save water?
-------------------------

To move nutrients up their roots, plants evaporate water from their leaves in a process called transpiration. The Stomata Microscopic pores on a plant, called stomata, allow carbon dioxide to enter. However, closing stomata is one of the best ways in which a plant can conserve water.

What is it called when plants lose water?
-----------------------------------------

Transpiration: The release of water from plant leaves.

What are water storage roots?
-----------------------------

water storage roots – found in arid regions, these are roots that collect large amounts of water during rainy season for the plant to use during dry season. These are most often found in xeriphytes (sometimes spelled xerophyte). Local examples include the East Indian Rosewood and the Starburst.

Where do plants get their nutrients?
------------------------------------

Although all green plants make their food by photosynthesis, they also need to get nutrients from the soil. These dissolve in water and are taken up by the roots of the plant. The most important plant nutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K).

Do plants move to get their nutrients?
--------------------------------------

Vegetable plant roots absorb nutrients through two distinctly different sequential processes. First, the nutrients must move from the soil to the surface of the plant roots. Once the nutrient gets inside the plant, the nutrients can move upward to the leaves and developing vegetable.

Why do some plants store water?
-------------------------------

Cactus and other plants that store lots of water to help them through the dry seasons are called succulents. During even light rains, these plants soak up as much water as they can hold, storing the water in large storage areas in roots, leaves, or plant stems.

Why are plants and animals important to ecosystems?
---------------------------------------------------

That’s because we rely on ecosystems to provide us with many services, like clean water, food, and medicines. Learn what you can do to help plants and animals adapt to climate change: You can provide wildlife in your very own backyard with food, water, cover, and shelter for raising their young.

How does the transpiration of plants help the environment?
----------------------------------------------------------

Water Cycle Regulation. Through this process of transpiration plants also help circulate water from the soil back into the atmosphere. Not only that, but plants help stabilize bodies of water such as rivers, lakes and streams. Plant roots improve soil stability, prevent landslides, and keep these ecosystems intact.

What do you call plants that store water?
-----------------------------------------

The seeds will germinate into a plant the next year. Image by Neelix. Cactus and other plants that store lots of water to help them through the dry seasons are called succulents. During even light rains, these plants soak up as much water as they can hold, storing the water in large storage areas in roots, leaves, or plant stems.

What are some ways that plants help the environment?
----------------------------------------------------

Not only that, but plants help stabilize bodies of water such as rivers, lakes and streams. Plant roots improve soil stability, prevent landslides, and keep these ecosystems intact. Despite the many benefits that plants provide, one of the environmental issues we face is environmental degradation.
