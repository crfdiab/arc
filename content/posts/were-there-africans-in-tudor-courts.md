Were there Africans in Tudor courts?
------------------------------------

From the early years of the 16th century there were Africans at both the Tudor and Stuart Courts. Catherine of Aragon had brought some African attendants with her when she arrived to marry Prince Arthur in 1501. One of these was the trumpeter ironically named John Blanke (blanco, white), who was paid 8d.

Were there Africans in 16th century England?
--------------------------------------------

When we think of Tudor England, we don’t immediately imagine black Africans being part of that society. Yet there were Africans here at that time, and they were considered numerous enough in Tudor towns and cities to inspire the phrases “to manie” and “great numbers” in two letters signed by Elizabeth I in July 1596.

Where did the slaves come from in Tudor England?
------------------------------------------------

The presence of free Africans living normal lives in Tudor England should reassess people’s perspective on the slave trade, that took hold from Bristol by the end of the following century. “They came to England from Africa, from Europe and from the Spanish Caribbean,” said Dr Kaufmann.

Are there any people of color in Tudor England?
-----------------------------------------------

Tudor society was much more diverse than many people realise. I also do not view that comment as racist. In fact, I find it an honest acknowledgement of the existence of racism throughout history in the sense that although many people of color lived in Tudor England, we know very little about them, the history erased.
