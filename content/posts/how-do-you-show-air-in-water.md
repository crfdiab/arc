How do you show air in water?
-----------------------------

We can show that air is dissolved in water with the help of following activity: Take some water in a glass or metal container like pan and heat it. Just before water begins to boil, you will notice some bubbles at the inner surface of the pan. These bubbles come from the air dissolved in water.

How do you do air experiments?

5 Ways to Demonstrate Air Pressure to Children

1. Water Glass Trick. Fill a cup one-third with water.
2. Fountain Bottle. Fill a 2-liter soda bottle half full of water.
3. Ping-Pong Funnel. Put a ping-pong ball inside the wide part of a funnel and blow hard into the narrow end.
4. The Million Dollar Bet.
5. Kissing Balloons.

What are the five uses of air?
------------------------------

Important Uses of Air

- Sustain life and growth.
- Combustion.
- Maintaining Temperature.
- Supplier of Energy.
- Photosynthesis. How much oxygen is in a cup of water?
    -------------------------------------
    
    Other sources of oxygen include the air and inflowing streams. Oxygen concentrations are much higher in air, which is about 21% oxygen, than in water, which is a tiny fraction of 1 percent oxygen.
    
    Does air weigh anything experiment?
    -----------------------------------
    
    In the balloon balance experiment, we are blowing up balloons. When blow-up balloons, the air is entering inside them and making the balloons expand. The deflated balloon loses its weight. And because of weight, the inflated balloon goes down, and the deflated one goes up on the scale.
    
    How to show that air contains water vapours?
    --------------------------------------------
    
    Design an experiment to show that air contains water vapours. Design an experiment to show that air contains water vapours. Please log in or register to answer this question. (i) Take ice cold water in a metallic tumbler and keep it in open air. (ii) After some time water droplets will be seen on the outer surface of the tumbler.
    
    What was the experiment to prove that water has air?
    ----------------------------------------------------
    
    Experiment to prove that water has air. up vote 8 down vote favorite. In elementary school, there was an experiment to show that water has dissolved air, which involved boiling some water and observing the drops at the surface of the container, and this proved that water has air.
    
    Whatâ€™s the best way to experiment with water?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    Show the kids the short and tall glasses. Let them choose which they believe will hold the most water. (They almost always choose the tall, thin glass.) Pour the water into this glass.
    
    How can you tell if water has air?
    ----------------------------------
    
    If no bubbles appear, tap the side of the bottle several times. The amount of air that dissolves in water increases with the pressure.
