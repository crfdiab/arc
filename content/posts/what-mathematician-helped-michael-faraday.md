What mathematician helped Michael Faraday?
------------------------------------------

When he was an apprentice bookbinder, he was offered a ticket to attend chemical lectures by Humphry Davy. The lectures inspired Faraday to become a scientist. He eventually became Davy’s laboratory assistant, enabling him to learn chemistry from one of the greatest practitioners of the day.

Who helped prove Faraday’s ideas using mathematical equations?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Maxwell, one of the few scientists who believed him, returned once again to his mathematics skills and, in 1873, he summed up the ideas of Faraday in four equations, with which all the electrical and magnetic phenomena are explained: for example, that the poles of a magnet cannot be separated, or that moving a magnet …

Who contributed in the field of electromagnetism?
-------------------------------------------------

Michael Faraday FRS  
Michael Faraday FRS (/ˈfærədeɪ, -di/; 22 September 1791 – 25 August 1867) was an English scientist who contributed to the study of electromagnetism and electrochemistry. His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis.

Who discovered electromagnetism electromagnetic induction?
----------------------------------------------------------

Michael Faraday  
Electromagnetic or magnetic induction is the production of an electromotive force across an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic field. Michael Faraday is generally credited with the discovery of induction in 1831, and James Clerk Maxwell mathematically described it as Faraday’s law of induction.

How did Michael Faraday contribute to the electromagnetic field?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Michael Faraday. It was by his research on the magnetic field around a conductor carrying a direct current that Faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics. Faraday also established that magnetism could affect rays of light and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena.

How many times was Michael Faraday mentioned in Maxwell’s paper?
----------------------------------------------------------------

In all Michael Faraday is cited six times and mentioned three times in Maxwell’s 1865 paper. However, this is not surprising considering that a large amount of Maxwell’s work is based on Faraday’s work and Maxwell mathematically modelled most of Faraday’s discoveries on electromagnetism into the theory that we know today.

When did Michael Faraday invent the first electric motor?
---------------------------------------------------------

In 1820 Michael Faraday produced the first known compounds of carbon and chlorine. In 1825 he isolated and described benzene. What’s more, in 1821 he invented the first electric motor, and in the early 1830s he discovered a way to convert mechanical energy into electricity on a large scale, creating the first electric generator.

When did Michael Faraday discover the induction ring?
-----------------------------------------------------

Discovering Electromagnetic Induction. In 1831, using his “induction ring”—the first electronic transformer—Faraday made one of his greatest discoveries: electromagnetic induction, the “induction” or generation of electricity in a wire by means of the electromagnetic effect of a current in another wire.
