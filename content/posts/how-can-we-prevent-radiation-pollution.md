How can we prevent radiation pollution?
---------------------------------------

Solutions of Radioactive Pollution:

1. Proper method of disposing radioactive waste: Radioactive waste still has some level of radiation.
2. Proper labeling:
3. Banning of nuclear tests:
4. Alternative energy sources:
5. Proper storage:
6. Reusing:
7. Use of protective equipments:

How does pollution affect radiation?
------------------------------------

The researchers report that the ratio of scattered radiation to global radiation increases with the increase in air pollution levels, meaning that less sunlight is actually reaching the Earth’s surface.

What are the sources of radiation pollution?
--------------------------------------------

Man-made sources of radiation pollution are mining and refining of plutonium and thorium, production and explosion and nuclear weapons, nuclear power plants and fuels and preparation of radioactive isotopes….Sources and Methods :

- Nuclear power plants.
- Nuclear weapon.
- Transportation.
- Disposal of nuclear waste.
- Uranium mining. What are symptoms of radiation?
    -------------------------------
    
    Possible symptoms include:
    
    
    - Nausea and vomiting.
    - Diarrhea.
    - Headache.
    - Fever.
    - Dizziness and disorientation.
    - Weakness and fatigue.
    - Hair loss.
    - Bloody vomit and stools from internal bleeding.
    
    What is the symptoms of radiation sickness?
    -------------------------------------------
    
    These symptoms include loss of appetite, fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and possibly even seizures and coma. This seriously ill stage may last from a few hours up to several months. People who receive a high radiation dose also can have skin damage.
    
    What are 3 ways to detect radiation?
    ------------------------------------
    
    When talking about radiation detection instruments, there are three types of detectors that are most commonly used, depending on the specific needs of the device. These are: Gas-Filled Detectors, Scintillators, and Solid State detectors.
    
    What can you do to reduce your exposure to radiation?
    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    Putting distance and shielding between you and a radiation source is an immediately effective way of reducing your exposure. Reducing the time you are being exposed is another way. (Image Courtesy of US EPA) Use a Respirator or Face Mask if You are exposed to airborne sources.
    
    How can we stop the spread of radioactive pollution?
    ----------------------------------------------------
    
    The radioactive pollution can be controlled by number of ways. It includes the stoppage of leakage from the radioactive materials including the nuclear reactors, industries and laboratories. The disposal of radioactive material must be safe and secure. They must be stored in the safe places and must be changed into harmless form.
    
    How to reduce radiation from your cell phone?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    Keep the phone on “Airplane” mode most of the time. Never put a cell phone to your head. Use speaker phone or this Air-Tube Headset for voice calls. You can also place a Ferrite Bead on your headset wire to reduce the radiation transmitting to your head. This video demonstrates this.
    
    Is it possible to control radiation from natural sources?
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    We cannot control radiation from natural sources but we can definitely control the radiation pollution from anthropogenic sources by adopting appropriate measures for prevention and control of pollution from radioactive materials so that it does not reach the dangerous level.
