How are fold mountains different from fault mountains?
------------------------------------------------------

Fault-block mountains (or just “block mountain“) are created when faults or cracks in the Earth’s crust force materials upward. So instead of folding, like the plate collision we get with fold mountains, block mountains break up into chunks and move up or down.

What is the stress involved in folded mountains?
------------------------------------------------

Mountains that are formed by compressional stresses are called folded mountains. In folded mountains, compressional stresses can cause anticlines and synclines to occur, or they can produce reverse faults and thrust faults.

How are fold mountains formed in some areas where plates are moving towards each other?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fold mountains are formed when two plates move together (a compressional plate margin). This can be where two continental plates move towards each other or a continental and an oceanic plate. The movement of the two plates forces sedimentary rocks upwards into a series of folds.

Why are fold mountains formed at the edge of continents?
--------------------------------------------------------

Fold Mountains are formed at the margins of continents due to: Fold Mountains are formed from the folding of crust and uprising of the sediments accumulated by rivers along the margins of the continents. The material between them is therefore forced upwards to form the mountains.

Which of the following is an example of fold mountain?
------------------------------------------------------

Fold mountains are the most common type of mountain in the world. Some of the most famous ranges are the Himalayas, Andes, and Alps. The Himalayas, in Asia, stretch through the borders of China, India, and Pakistan. The crust beneath the Himalayas is still being folded.

Why are fold mountains found on the edge of the continental crust?
------------------------------------------------------------------

For this reason, most fold mountains are found on the edge or former edge of continental plate boundaries. Rocks on the edge of continental crust are often weaker and less stable than rocks found in the continental interior. This can make them more susceptible to folding and warping.

Where do folded rock layers tend to occur?
------------------------------------------

At what depth do folded rock layers tend to occur Deep beneath earths surface Name two plates where folded mountains can be found New Zealand Appalachians Folded mountains process and example

How are two continental plates move towards each other?
-------------------------------------------------------

Two continental plates move towards each other the plates collide and subduction stops rocks at the edges of the plates crumple up into folded mountains ex Urals and alps Volcanic mountains process and example Volcanic activity tends to form mountains ex cascades and Himalayas Dome mountains process and ex

How are block mountains different from Fold Mountains?
------------------------------------------------------

Block Mountains. Block mountains are created because of faulting on a large scale (when large areas or blocks of earth are broken and displaced vertically or horizontally). The uplifted blocks are termed as horsts, and the lowered blocks are called graben.
