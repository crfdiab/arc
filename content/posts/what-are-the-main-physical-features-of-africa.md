What are the main physical features of Africa?
----------------------------------------------

It is divided in half almost equally by the equator. Africa has eight major physical regions: the Sahara, the Sahel, the Ethiopian Highlands, the savanna, the Swahili Coast, the rain forest, the African Great Lakes and Southern Africa. Each of these regions has unique animal and plant communities.

----------------------------------------------

Check out some of the most-impressive physical features found in Africa.

    - expansive grasslands. What are some famous features of Africa?
        ----------------------------------------
        
        The following are the most popular landmarks, but there are others just as beautiful and interesting in Africa, the Cradle of Humankind.
        
        
        - \#1. Victoria Falls.
        - \#2. Serengeti National Park.

        What are 4 physical features?
        -----------------------------
        
        Therefore, Standard 4 contains these themes: The Concept of Place and The Characteristics of Places. Places are jointly characterized by their physical and human properties. Their physical characteristics include landforms, climate, soils, and hydrology.
        
        What are natural physical features?
        -----------------------------------
        
        A natural landscape is made up of a collection of landforms, such as mountains, hills, plains, and plateaus. Lakes, streams, soils (such as sand or clay), and natural vegetation are other features of natural landscapes.
        
        What are the major physical features of Africa?
        -----------------------------------------------
        
        1\. Essential Question &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the major geographical features of Africa? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; 2. Africa’s geographical features! 3. Sahara &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;desert in northern Africa &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;largest desert in the world at 3,500,000 square miles &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;from Arabic word Al-Sahra &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; 4.
        
        What did Africa look like 10, 000 years ago?
        --------------------------------------------
        
        If you were to zoom in far enough, you’d see river valleys, fertile plateaus, big harbors, jungles and desert oases. In short, you’d see plenty of places that look ripe for human settlement! More than 10,000 years ago, the major cities of Africa and the Middle East were far from being formed.
        
        What are the names of the mountains in Africa?
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        Most of the highlands and mountains are the result of recent volcanic activities (e.g east African mountains like the Kilmanjaro -19,340 ft (5895 m); Kenya 17,058 ft (5200 m); Meru -4569 m and Elgon 4053 m and in the Ethiopian highlands Ras Dashen is about 15,000ft (4,573 m).
        
        Why is the southern part of Africa cooler than the northern part?
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        
        The shape difference again makes the southern portion of Africa cooler than the northern section of the continent (thereby making East Africa more favorable for European settlement than West Africa: Zambia and Niger are both located on Latitude 15 degrees from the equator but Niger is warmer).
