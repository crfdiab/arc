Which side of the moon is illuminated?
--------------------------------------

The sun illuminates one side of the moon and leaves the other side in shadow. Anyone can see that the side of the moon facing towards the Sun is bright, and the side facing away from the sun is dark. As the moon orbits the Earth we see these lighted and dark parts of the surface in changing proportions.

Is the right side or left side of the moon illuminated when it is waxing?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Waxing is “Maxing,” or growing with light until a full moon is reached. Waning is the opposite, or decreasing after a full moon, and is always illuminated on the left. Then, there is a waxing or waning Gibbous moon, which means more than half of the moon is illuminated.

What does it mean when the moon is illuminated?
-----------------------------------------------

The moon shines because its surface reflects light from the sun. This is when the moon is between the sun and the Earth, so that the side of the moon reflecting sunlight is facing away from Earth. In the days before and after a new moon, we’ll see a sliver of the moon reflecting sunlight.

Which is part of the Moon is illuminated?
-----------------------------------------

More than half portion of the Moon is illuminated and as days pass, more and more becomes lighted. Full Moon:This phase occurs when the earth is between the sun and the moon. Here the illuminated side of the Moon faces the Earth.

What does the far side of the Moon look like?
---------------------------------------------

At that point, the far side of the Moon is facing the Sun. This phase is called a new moon. During the new moon, the side facing Earth is dark. ? New: We cannot see the Moon when it is a new moon. ? Waxing Crescent: In the Northern Hemisphere, we see the waxing crescent phase as a thin crescent of light on the right.

Which is the left hand side of the Moon now?
--------------------------------------------

Last Quarter – At this point of the lunar cycle, the Moon has reached half illumination. Now it’s the left-hand side of the Moon that’s illuminated, and the right-hand side in darkness (from a northern hemisphere perspective).

Where does the light on the Moon come from?
-------------------------------------------

What you may have heard referred to as “moonlight” is actually just sunlight reflecting off of the Moon’s surface. The Sun’s light comes from one direction, and it always illuminates, or lights up, one half of the Moon – the side of the Moon that is facing the Sun. The other side of the Moon is dark.
