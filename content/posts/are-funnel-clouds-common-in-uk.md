Are funnel clouds common in UK?
-------------------------------

“Weak tornadoes and funnel clouds are not unusual sights in the UK during showery periods. “On average, we get about 35 tornadoes a year in the UK and we’ve had reports of a few around the UK during the showery weather we’ve had in recent weeks.”

Are funnel clouds rare?
-----------------------

Funnel clouds are a rare type of cloud formation, sometimes spotted here in the UK. Funnel clouds differ from tornadoes in that they do not touch the ground. Funnel clouds are cone-shaped formations which stem from the base of a cloud, but do not reach the ground.

How dangerous are funnel clouds?
--------------------------------

A funnel cloud is a rotating column of air (visible due to condensation) that does not reach the ground. If a funnel cloud reaches all the way to the ground, it is then classified as a tornado. When out on the road, funnel clouds should be treated as tornadoes, since they could touch down.

What is a funnel cloud that touches the ground?
-----------------------------------------------

tornado  
If the rotating funnel cloud stretches down and touches the ground, it is called a tornado. Many tornadoes are at one time funnel clouds, but not all funnel clouds become tornadoes.

What causes a funnel cloud to form?
-----------------------------------

Funnel clouds are caused by vertical stretching of vorticity. Vorticity can be thought of as “spin” in the atmosphere, which is usually produced by wind shear. As this vorticity is streched vertically the area of rotation shrinks and the spinning air speeds up.

Can a funnel cloud become a tornado?
------------------------------------

Funnel clouds or ‘tuba’ are extending, spinning fingers of cloud that reach towards the ground, but never touch it. When they do reach the ground they become a tornado.

Can there be a tornado without clouds?
--------------------------------------

Tornadoes can occur without funnel clouds, as shown in this example from NSSL. The lack of a visible funnel can be related to several processes. Most likely, the pressure drop and lift in the tornado vortex was too weak to cool and condense a visible funnel; and/or the air below cloud base was too dry.

Does the sky get green before a tornado?
----------------------------------------

While a green sky is often an indicator of a severe storm that can produce tornadoes and damaging hail, a green sky does not guarantee severe weather, just as tornadoes can appear from a sky without a hint of green. To sum up, the reason for green skies before a storm isn’t entirely known.

What kind of cloud is a funnel cloud?
-------------------------------------

Arguably the most popular type of funnel cloud is the tornado that’s produced from strong thunderstorms, but there are different kinds of clouds that can be classified as the tuba cloud feature. The best way to define funnel clouds are condensed water droplets that form around a spinning column of air.

Where did the funnel cloud hit in Canada?
-----------------------------------------

Cold-air funnel clouds are a common sight along the Pacific Coast of the United States, particularly in the spring or fall. On July 29, 2013, a cold-core funnel cloud touched down as an EF0 tornado in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, causing extensive damage in the form of downed trees on a golf course.

When does a funnel cloud become a tornado?
------------------------------------------

Funnel clouds form most frequently in association with supercell thunderstorms. If a funnel cloud touches the ground it becomes a tornado. Most tornadoes begin as funnel clouds, but many funnel clouds do not make ground contact and so do not become tornadoes.

Can a funnel cloud touch down on the ground?
--------------------------------------------

Although cold-air funnels rarely make ground contact, surface level vortices sometimes become strong enough for condensation cloud to “touch down” briefly, becoming visible as weak tornadoes or waterspouts.
