Is there any way to stop the burning of fossil fuels?
-----------------------------------------------------

The only way industrial society will stop burning fossil fuels is if it can no longer get its hands on them. Renewable energy is growing at unprecedented rates, but isn’t slowing the much faster growth of fossil fuel burn. Green tech is not a solution.

Why is it important to reduce fossil fuels?
-------------------------------------------

Why is it important to reduce fossil fuels? Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas results in carbon pollution, which causes climate change. So if we want to stop climate change (and avoid devastating extreme weather, sea level rise wiping out communities, global conflict and instability, etc.), we have to stop burning fossil fuels.

Why is it important to find alternative sources of energy?
----------------------------------------------------------

Higher energy demands and poor efficiency practices have increased fossil fuel usage, and it’s now critical to find alternative means of energy generation before depleting the global supply. It takes individual and community actions to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels.

How can we reduce the use of petroleum?
---------------------------------------

Reduce your use of plastic. Unless it’s marked “compostable,” plastic is made from petroleum. It can linger in the environment for hundreds of years and never break down completely, polluting the soil and groundwater. When plastics are not disposed of properly, they kill animals who mistake them for food.

Why do we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels?
------------------------------------------------------

However, burning fossil fuels has been attributed to atmospheric pollution, global warming, the release of toxins into the environment, and health problems. Only by reducing dependency on these can such issues be mitigated. Fortunately, there are many ways to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels – here are 20 of them you can do actively.

How are fossil fuels bad for the environment?
---------------------------------------------

Natural gas, petroleum, and coal have accounted for 81.5% of the nation’s energy consumption for more than 100 years, according to the US Energy Information Administration. However, burning fossil fuels has been linked to atmospheric pollution, global warming, the release of toxins into the environment, and health problems.

How is the burning of fossil fuels global change?
-------------------------------------------------

What is Global Change? The burning of fossil fuels refers to the burning of oil, natural gas, and coal to generate energy. We use this energy to generate electricity, and to power transportation (for example, cars and planes) and industrial processes.
