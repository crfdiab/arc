Is whaling allowed in Antarctica?
---------------------------------

That is, because Japan is legally prohibited from killing whales for commercial purposes, Japan is using scientific whaling as a guise under which it can kill Southern Ocean whales, then sell the meat and support the national whaling industry.

Why is whaling a problem in Antarctica?
---------------------------------------

This is a problem because marine mammals like whales, seals, and the birds living in Antarctica all eat krill. A whale can eat huge amounts at a time. If the overfishing of krill lowers the amount available, these other animals would suffer too. One solution is to limit the amount of krill that can be caught each year.

When did Japan stop whaling in Antarctica?
------------------------------------------

2014  
Until now, Japan’s whalers exploited a loophole in International Whaling Commission (IWC), rules, which allows whaling for ‘scientific research’. They’ve done this for decades, despite a 2014 order from the UN’s International Court of Justice ordering Japan to stop its whaling programme in Antarctica!

What are the rules for whaling in Antarctica?
---------------------------------------------

One solution is to limit the amount of krill that can be caught each year. Since 1959, the Antarctic Treaty sets the rules for what is allowed in Antarctica. Whaling today is no longer as big of a problem as it was in the past and is only allowed for scientific research, but it does still take place.

Is there any way to help stop whaling?
--------------------------------------

You need to be aware of this situation so that you can better articulate your argument. This can help you focus how you might be able to help stop whaling. Whaling is part of a world-wide conversation. In 2014, the U.N. ordered Japan to stop whaling near Antarctica.

How can we save the whales from extinction?
-------------------------------------------

For us to save the whales from extinction, humans need to stop whaling all together. To stop the commercial whaling, we need to stop purchasing whale products. That way they will receive no income and will eventually stop whaling.

When did the Japanese stop whaling in Antarctica?
-------------------------------------------------

In 2019 the Japanese stopped this scientific whaling in Antarctic waters and recommenced commercial whaling in their own territorial waters. Antarctic whaling began on a large scale in 1904 with the building of a whale processing station at Grytviken, South Georgia.
