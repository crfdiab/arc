Is a valley in between mountains?

Where are valleys most likely to be found?
------------------------------------------

Valleys are most commonly drained by rivers and may occur in a relatively flat plain or between ranges of hills or mountains. Those valleys produced by tectonic action are called rift valleys.

Why are valleys colder than areas that are higher up?
-----------------------------------------------------

But if you got somewhere which is high up and the air can cool down on the tops of mountains, it’s then denser around it and it falls downwards and if it’s not falling very far it doesn’t compress very much, doesn’t get very much hotter so you get, locally very cold air is in bottoms of valleys but globally it’s warmer low down and colder higher.
