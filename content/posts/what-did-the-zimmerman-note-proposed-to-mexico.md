What did the Zimmerman Note proposed to Mexico?
-----------------------------------------------

The note revealed a plan to renew unrestricted submarine warfare and to form an alliance with Mexico and Japan if the United States declared war on Germany. The message was intercepted by the British and passed on to the United States; its publication caused outrage and contributed to the U.S. entry into World War I.

How did the Zimmermann telegram affect American neutrality?
-----------------------------------------------------------

In the message, Zimmermann instructed the German diplomats to approach the Mexican government, if United States entered the war in Europe, to offer an alliance between Germany and Mexico. But without evidence of expanded German hostilities, Wilson and the Americans remained neutral, at least in the short-term.

Why did Mexico decline the Zimmerman telegram?
----------------------------------------------

The main purpose of the telegram was to make the Mexican government declare war on the United States in hopes of tying down American forces and slowing the export of American arms. The Mexicans were willing to consider the alliance but declined the deal after Americans had been informed of the telegram.

Why did the US want to remain neutral at the start of the war?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Why did the United States choose to stay neutral in 1914? Put simply the United States did not concern itself with events and alliances in Europe and thus stayed out of the war. Wilson was firmly opposed to war, and believed that the key aim was to ensure peace, not only for the United States but across the world.

Why was the Zimmerman Telegram important to Mexico?
---------------------------------------------------

Mexican response. If Mexico were to enter war against the United States, it would strain relations with those nations. The Carranza government was recognized de jure by the United States on 31 August 1917 as a direct consequence of the Zimmermann telegram, since recognition was necessary to ensure Mexican neutrality in World War I.

What did Germany promise Mexico in the Mexican American War?
------------------------------------------------------------

In return for attacking the United States, Mexico was promised the return of territory lost during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), including Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, as well as substantial financial assistance. German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann. Public Domain

How did the Zimmerman note affect World War 1?
----------------------------------------------

Historians continue to debate just how influential the Zimmermann note was in the United Statesâ€™ entrance into World War I. While most agree that it helped turn public opinion against Germany, they also argue that the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare had already sounded the death knell of American neutrality.

Is the Zimmermann Telegram real or a fake?
------------------------------------------

Some of those in the United States who still held out for neutrality at first claimed the telegram was a fake. This notion was dispelled two days later, when Zimmermann himself confirmed its authenticity.
