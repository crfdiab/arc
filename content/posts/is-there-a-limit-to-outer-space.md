Is there a limit to outer space?
--------------------------------

International law does not define the edge of space, or the limit of national airspace. The FAI defines the Kármán line as space beginning 100 kilometres (54 nautical miles; 62 miles; 330,000 feet) above Earth’s mean sea level.

How long will the universe exist?
---------------------------------

22 billion years in the future is the earliest possible end of the Universe in the Big Rip scenario, assuming a model of dark energy with w = −1.5. False vacuum decay may occur in 20 to 30 billion years if Higgs boson field is metastable.

Is it possible to travel beyond the observable universe?
--------------------------------------------------------

Ultimately, this means that we could only reach the edge of the observable universe if we develop a method of transport that allows us to either 1) Travel faster than the speed of light (something which most physicists think is impossible) 2) Transcend spacetime (by using wormholes or warp drive, which most physicists also think is impossible).

What makes it impossible to know where space ends?
--------------------------------------------------

This one feature makes it almost impossible to know where space ends. You guessed it – it is expansion. From the day that all the dense matter blew up (do not worry if you do not remember this event, the Big Bang was 13.8 billion years ago), the universe started expanding.

Are there any spacecraft that have gone beyond our Solar System?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Image Credits: NASA, ESA, and Z. Levay (STScI) Five robotic spacecraft have sufficient velocity to escape the bounds of our solar system and travel into interstellar space, but only one—NASA’s Voyager 1—has crossed that boundary so far. Voyager 1 transitioned into interstellar space in 2012. Voyager 2 likely will be next.

Are there more galaxies outside of our universe?
------------------------------------------------

And outside of our universe might lie a much bigger universe. We’re merely confined in a black hole inside of it. Another theory suggests that the not yet observable part of our universe contains more universe. Nothing else. More stars, galaxies, and clusters in an infinitely expanding space.
