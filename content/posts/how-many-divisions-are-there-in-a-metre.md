A metre is divided into 100 equal divisions called centimetre (cm).

How is 1 meter defined?
-----------------------

Since 1983, the metre has been internationally defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second. By using a light source of known and stable wavelength, lengths up to 100 metres can be directly measured, with accuracies up to 1 part in a few million.

What do you call 100 meters?
----------------------------

The hectometre (International spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures; SI symbol: hm) or hectometer (American spelling) is a unit of length in the metric system, equal to one hundred metres. The word comes from a combination of “metre” and the SI prefix “hecto-“, meaning “hundred”.

------------------------------------

The three measures are descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive. Descriptive is the most basic form of measurement.

What do you call meters with more than four beats?
--------------------------------------------------

Metres with more than four beats are called quintuple metres (5), sextuple metres (6), septuple metres (7), etc. 4. Higher meters which are divisible by 2 or 3 are considered equivalent to groupings of tuple or triple meter measures, thus, 6 4. See: hypermetre and additive rhythm and divisive rhythm .

What is the value of Least count of meter scale?
------------------------------------------------

Let’s suppose that the metre scale has 100 divisions of cm in one metre. So it’s least count is 1/100=0.01 And if along with cm denotion mm is also represented on the same scale then it’s least count in one unit of metre will be 1/1000=0.001. And again if it has more number of divisions on It, the least count decrease in the similar fashion.
