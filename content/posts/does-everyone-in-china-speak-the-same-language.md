Does everyone in China speak the same language?
-----------------------------------------------

Over 90% of the population is Han Chinese, but Han Chinese speak some 1,500 dialects. While the dialects are said to be just variations of Mandarin, linguists say some of them are so different they are practically distinct languages.

Can Chinese people understand old Chinese?
------------------------------------------

If you’re asking if anyone today could understand ancient spoken Chinese, the answer is a resounding no. All modern dialects of Chinese have evolved very far from Old Chinese.

Are all Chinese dialects mutually intelligible?
-----------------------------------------------

Being from China equals speaking a single language called Chinese; 2. All varieties of this language are mutually intelligible. In Mandarin Chinese, Mandarin and Cantonese are called the Northern dialect (beifang fangyan) and Yue dialect (yue fangyang) and are believed to be merely dialects and not different languages.

What is the oldest Chinese character?
-------------------------------------

The evolution of the Chinese character for dragon (long 龍) is illustrated below: Oracle Bone Inscriptions refers to the writings inscribed on the carapaces of tortoises and mammals during the Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046 B.C.). This is the earliest form of Chinese characters.

What are the opinions of Asians about each other?
-------------------------------------------------

The poll shows Asians with quite disparate opinions about each other. Half or more in seven of 10 Asian countries surveyed express a favorable view of Japan, while majorities in six of 10 say this about China.

How are the dialects of China different from each other?
--------------------------------------------------------

Many Chinese dialects are at least as different from each other as the Romance languages are, which should classify them as separate languages. However, for now they are almost universally described as dialects, and since most of them are spoken locally and not taught, there is no real way to teach it but aurally, or through immersion.

What kind of a culture does China have?
---------------------------------------

China is not an individualistic culture, but neither is it – as claimed incorrectly by many people – a collectivistic culture. It is a relational culture. Guanxi is a Chinese concept referring to the tight social networks that shape Chinese society.

Why do Chinese only hang out in groups?
---------------------------------------

I told this to an American friend, and she said I brought a new perspective to her because she thought the reason most Chinese only hang out within their groups is because they don’t want to come out of their comfort zone. There is some truth in that.
