parallax, in astronomy, the difference in direction of a celestial object as seen by an observer from two widely separated points. The measurement of parallax is used directly to find the distance of the body from Earth (geocentric parallax) and from the Sun (heliocentric parallax).

How long does it take 61 Cygni AC to orbit the star?
----------------------------------------------------

61 Cygni Ac is a planet that takes 98% of an Earth year to orbit the star at a distance of 7 ⁄ 8 that of Earth’s.

Are there any planets in the constellation 61 Cygni?
----------------------------------------------------
