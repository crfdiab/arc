How does abiotic and biotic factors affect an ecosystem?
--------------------------------------------------------

Biotic factors are all of the living organisms within an ecosystem. These may be plants, animals, fungi, and any other living things. Abiotic factors are all of the non-living things in an ecosystem. If one factor is removed or changed, it can affect the entire ecosystem and all of the organisms that live there.

Where do abiotic components originate in the hydrosphere?

Which is an example of a biotic resource?
-----------------------------------------

Examples of biotic resources include all the living components present in an ecosystem. These include producers, consumers, decomposers and detritivores. The term abiotic refers to all the non-living factors present in an ecosystem.
