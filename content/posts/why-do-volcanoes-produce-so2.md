Why do volcanoes produce SO2?
-----------------------------

Sulfur dioxide indicates magma is near the surface (Credit: Clor, Laura. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is released from a volcano when magma is relatively near the surface. If SO2 is detected at a non-erupting volcano, it could be a sign that it will erupt soon.

What is a volcanic lava?
------------------------

Lava is molten rock (magma) that has been expelled from the interior of a terrestrial planet (such as Earth) or a moon. The volcanic rock resulting from subsequent cooling is also often described as lava. A lava flow is an outpouring of lava created during an effusive eruption.

Is there radiation in lava?
---------------------------

So, why is corium so dangerous? Well, even long after the flow has stopped, that lava will be highly radioactive for decades to centuries (along with the surrounding countryside if radioactive material made it out of the containment vessel) as the various radioactive materials in the lava decay.

How do you make a homemade volcano erupt?
-----------------------------------------

Making the Eruption Put 2 tablespoons of baking soda into the volcano. Squirt about 1 teaspoon of dish soap onto the baking soda. Add a few drops of red and yellow food coloring to the volcano. Pour in 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) vinegar to make the volcano erupt!

What can volcanoes causes to human?
-----------------------------------

Impacts on Human Health runny nose sore throat/coughing wheezing/shortness of breath possible bronchitus

What can volcanoes do to you?
-----------------------------

Volcanoes can also have long-term effects on the climate, making the world cooler. Fast-moving lava can kill people and falling ash can make it hard for them to breathe. They can also die from famine, fires and earthquakes which can be related to volcanoes. People can lose their possessions as volcanoes can destroy houses, roads and fields.

How do volcanoes affect the environment?
----------------------------------------

6 ways volcanoes benefit Earth, our environment Atmospheric cooling. One of the shorter-term benefits could be observed with recent large eruptions including 1991’s Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines and 1982’s El Chichón eruption in Mexico, which Land formation. A long-term benefit of volcanic activity is seen in the Hawaiian Islands’ very existence . Water production. Fertile land.
