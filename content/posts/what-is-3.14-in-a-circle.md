What is 3.14 in a circle?
-------------------------

Succinctly, pi—which is written as the Greek letter for p, or π—is the ratio of the circumference of any circle to the diameter of that circle. In decimal form, the value of pi is approximately 3.14.

Why do we use 3.14 for pi?
--------------------------

It was not until the 18th century — about two millennia after the significance of the number 3.14 was first calculated by Archimedes — that the name “pi” was first used to denote the number. “He used it because the Greek letter Pi corresponds with the letter ‘P’… and pi is about the perimeter of the circle.”

How do you do pi in math?
-------------------------

In basic mathematics, pi is used to find the area and circumference of a circle. Pi is used to find area by multiplying the radius squared times pi. So, in trying to find the area of a circle with a radius of 3 centimeters, π32 = 28.27 cm.

Why is the number pi so important?
----------------------------------

The constant π helps us understand our universe with greater clarity. The definition of π inspired a new notion of the measurement of angles, a new unit of measurement. This important angle measure is known as “radian measure” and gave rise to many important insights in our physical world.

How 3.14 is calculated?
-----------------------

The circumference of a circle is found with the formula C= π\*d = 2\*π\*r. Thus, pi equals a circle’s circumference divided by its diameter. Plug your numbers into a calculator: the result should be roughly 3.14. Repeat this process with several different circles, and then average the results.

How was Pi calculated?
----------------------

The ancient Babylonians calculated the area of a circle by taking 3 times the square of its radius, which gave a value of pi = 3. The first calculation of π was done by Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BC), one of the greatest mathematicians of the ancient world.

Does iPhone have a pi symbol?
-----------------------------

Add a Greek keyboard to your iPhone to enable access to the letter Pi. Now that you’ve got the Greek keyboard available, simply switch to it by tapping the Globe icon down in the lower-left corner of your iOS keyboard and, when you cycle through to Greek, tap π! Or, well, Happy π Day!

Is there a pi Emoji?
