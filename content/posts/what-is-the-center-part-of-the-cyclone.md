What is the center part of the cyclone?
---------------------------------------

eye  
The eye is a region of mostly calm weather at the center of tropical cyclones. The eye of a storm is a roughly circular area, typically 30–65 kilometers (19–40 miles) in diameter. It is surrounded by the eyewall, a ring of towering thunderstorms where the most severe weather and highest winds occur.

What is at the center of a mid latitude cyclone?
------------------------------------------------

Mid-latitude or frontal cyclones are large traveling atmospheric cyclonic storms up to 2000 kilometers in diameter with centers of low atmospheric pressure. In their mature stage, mid-latitude cyclones have a warm front on the east side of the storm’s center and a cold front to the west.

What is the middle part of a tropical storm called?
---------------------------------------------------

At the centre of the tropical cyclone, air is subsiding, which makes it dry and often cloud free, and there is little or no wind at the surface. This is called the eye of the storm.

What are the three main parts of a tropical cyclone?
----------------------------------------------------

The main parts of a tropical cyclone are the rainbands, the eye, and the eyewall. Air spirals in toward the center in a counter-clockwise pattern in the northern hemisphere (clockwise in the southern hemisphere), and out the top in the opposite direction.

What kind of Cyclone is in the middle latitudes?
------------------------------------------------

What is a mid-latitude cyclone?- The mid-latitude cyclone is a synoptic scale low pressure system that has cyclonic (counter-clockwise in northern hemisphere) flow that is found in the middle latitudes (i.e., 30 ° N-55 ° N)- IT IS NOT A HURRICANE OR TROPICAL STORM

What is the circulation pattern of a cyclone?
---------------------------------------------

A cyclone is a general term for a weather system in which winds rotate inwardly to an area of low atmospheric pressure. For large weather systems, the circulation pattern is in a counterclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and a clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere.

Where is the eye of a cyclonic storm?
-------------------------------------

At the centre of the cyclonic storm, there is a calm, cloudless area which is called the ‘eye’ of the storm. At this place, there is no rain and the wind speed is light. According to the World Meteorological Organization, cyclones are classified as tropical cyclones and extra-tropical cyclones, depending upon the wind speed.

Which is the opposite of a tropical cyclone?
--------------------------------------------

Tropical cyclones are also known as hurricanes. An anticyclone is the opposite of a cyclone. An anticyclone’s winds rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere around a center of high pressure. Air comes in from above and sinks to the ground. High pressure centers generally have fair weather.
