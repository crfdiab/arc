Can a 6.5 earthquake cause a tsunami?
-------------------------------------

Magnitudes between 6.5 and 7.5 Earthquakes of this size do not usually produce destructive tsunamis. However, small sea level changes might be observed in the vicinity of the epicenter.

Is 6.5 A big earthquake?
------------------------

The 6.5-magnitude earthquake in a remote area of the state, felt as far as California and Utah, was the strongest there since the 1950s, an expert said. A 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck a remote area in western Nevada early on Friday, damaging a major highway and shaking homes as far as Utah and California.

What would be the likely impact of a magnitude 6 earthquake?
------------------------------------------------------------

Generally, earthquakes of magnitude 6 and above are the ones for concern. When nearby, they can cause shaking intensities that can begin to break chimneys and cause considerable damage to the most seismically vulnerable structures, such as non-retrofitted brick buildings.

Can a 6.2 earthquake cause tsunami?
-----------------------------------

No, all earthquakes do not cause tsunamis. There are four conditions necessary for an earthquake to cause a tsunami: (1) The earthquake must occur beneath the ocean or cause material to slide in the ocean. (2) The earthquake must be strong, at least magnitude 6.5.

How bad is 6.5 earthquake?
--------------------------

May cause a lot of damage in very populated areas. Major earthquake. Serious damage….

What kind of waves are produced by an earthquake?
-------------------------------------------------

Earthquakes waves. When an earthquake occurs, it releases waves of energy, which are known as Seismic waves. It is like the ripples created in water if you throw a stone in it. Seismic waves are like those ripples which can travel through the inside of the earth, as well as on the surface. P waves, S waves and Surface waves.

How are seismic waves like ripples in water?
--------------------------------------------

When an earthquake occurs, it releases waves of energy, which are known as Seismic waves. It is like the ripples created in water if you throw a stone in it. Seismic waves are like those ripples which can travel through the inside of the earth, as well as on the surface.

What is the dominant frequency of an earthquake?
------------------------------------------------

Attenuation of the waves in rock imposes high-frequency limits, and in small to moderate earthquakes the dominant frequencies extend in surface waves from about 1 to 0.1 hertz.

Is the seismic energy the same as surface waves?
------------------------------------------------

Earthquakes radiate seismic energy as both body and surface waves but deep earthquakes generally do not generate surface waves.
