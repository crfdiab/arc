What is the average rainfall in a desert yearly?
------------------------------------------------

10 inches  
Most experts agree that a desert is an area of land that receives no more than 25 centimeters (10 inches) of precipitation a year. The amount of evaporation in a desert often greatly exceeds the annual rainfall. In all deserts, there is little water available for plants and other organisms.

What is the average amount of rainfall in a year?
-------------------------------------------------

Approximately 505,000 cubic kilometres (121,000 cu mi) of water falls as precipitation each year; 398,000 cubic kilometres (95,000 cu mi) of it over the oceans. Given the Earth’s surface area, that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 millimetres (39 in).

How much rain does the Sahara desert get?
-----------------------------------------

It stretches across most of North Africa and occupies 3.6 million square miles. The Sahara is one of the most arid locations on Earth but is not uniformly so. The central part of the Sahara, known as the Libyan Desert, is the driest, receiving an average of less than 1 inch of rain per year.

Why is there no rain in the desert a year?
------------------------------------------

Most deserts get what little precipitation they do receive in a few, heavy rainfalls, rather than many light rains spread out over the course of the year. This leads to seasonal lakes and rivers which may last a few months, or even only a few days. Why is there no rain in the desert?

What’s the average amount of precipitation in Arizona?
------------------------------------------------------

weather and science facts. The tables below give yearly averages for rainfall and snowfall at cities, towns and parks in Arizona. While snowstorms are rare in many parts of the state, in northern Arizona, some precipitation during the year does fall as snow. Each place has a total for the amount of precipitation it usually receives in a year.

How much rain does the Earth get in a year?
-------------------------------------------

Volume of Earth’s Annual Precipitation. “Because Earth’s average annual rainfall is about 100 cm (39 inches), the average time that the water spends in the atmosphere, between its evaporation from the surface and its return as precipitation, is about 1/40 of a year, or about nine days.”.
