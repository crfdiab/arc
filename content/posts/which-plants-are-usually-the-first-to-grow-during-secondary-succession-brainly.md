Which plants are usually the first to grow during secondary succession Brainly?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation: The first species to colonize are usually fast growing herbaceous plants, such as conifers or ferns, which require high levels of light.

What grows first in a succession?
---------------------------------

The first organisms to appear in areas of primary succession are often mosses or lichens. These organisms are known as pioneer species because they are the first species present; pioneer species must be hardy and strong, just like human pioneers.

What is the correct order of plant growth during succession?
------------------------------------------------------------

The labels I-VII represent the different stages of primary succession. I-bare rocks, II-pioneers (mosses, lichen, algae, fungi), III-annual herbaceous plants, IV-perennial herbaceous plants and grasses, V-shrubs, VI-shade intolerant trees, VII-shade tolerant trees.

Would a newly formed volcanic island be a site of primary succession or secondary succession?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The community development in a newly formed volcanic island is an example of primary succession since the development takes place on an area that is devoid of any previous ecosystem element.

Which of the following is the best example of secondary succession?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In secondary succession, a previously occupied area is re-colonized following a disturbance that kills much or all of its community. A classic example of secondary succession occurs in oak and hickory forests cleared by wildfire. Wildfires will burn most vegetation and kill animals unable to flee the area.

What are the different types of plant succession?
-------------------------------------------------

The primary and secondary successions may be of the following types: The plant succession which starts in the aquatic environment is called “hydrarch.” A series of changes taking place in the vegetation of hydrarch is called hydrosere. It is special type of sere which begins on a salty soil or in saline water.

When does the initiation of secondary succession occur?
-------------------------------------------------------

The initiation of secondary succession always occurs due to some external factors. After a forest fire, the tall trees become destroyed, and the first plants that grow in such areas are usually annual plants. The following annual plants are grasses and low-lying plants and other pioneer species.

What are the pioneer species in secondary succession?
-----------------------------------------------------

The pioneer species in secondary succession are mostly grasses. Numerous intermediate communities are formed during primary succession. Fewer intermediate communities are formed during secondary succession. No previous community is present in the environment prior to primary succession.

What is the environment like during primary succession?
-------------------------------------------------------

There is no organic matter present in the environment undergoing primary succession. The environment during primary succession is unfavorable and is made favorable as new species continue to grow. The environment is favorable from the beginning.
