Is there a plate tectonic cause for most earthquakes?
-----------------------------------------------------

Movement in narrow zones along plate boundaries causes most earthquakes. Most seismic activity occurs at three types of plate boundaries—divergent, convergent, and transform. When the plates finally give and slip due to the increased pressure, energy is released as seismic waves, causing the ground to shake.

How do tectonic plates cause natural disasters?
-----------------------------------------------

The reason so many earthquakes occur in these areas is because this is where many of Earth’s tectonic plates come together. Earthquakes begin deep underground along plate boundaries. Eventually, the pulling becomes too much and the plates suddenly break free from each other, causing an earthquake!

Are tectonic plates dangerous?
------------------------------

Some of the most destructive natural hazards that occur on Earth—earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions—are associated with tectonic plate boundaries. Today, approximately 40% of the world’s population lives near plate boundaries.

What happens when tectonic plates collide?
------------------------------------------

If two tectonic plates collide, they form a convergent plate boundary. Usually, one of the converging plates will move beneath the other, a process known as subduction. The new magma (molten rock) rises and may erupt violently to form volcanoes, often building arcs of islands along the convergent boundary.

How do tectonic plates affect humans?
-------------------------------------

This process of plate tectonics is one of Earth’s defining characteristics. Humans mostly experience it through earthquakes and, more rarely, volcanoes. Without plate tectonics, there will be far less human deaths from natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and even tsunamis.

How does the movement of tectonic plates cause earthquakes?
-----------------------------------------------------------

For example, one plate may move north, while the other may move south. Stress can build up to a significant amount while the plates are held stationary, but trying to move, which can then be released as an earthquake. Earthquakes are one type of natural disaster. They cause large tremors that can bring down man-made buildings.

What causes an earthquake and what causes them to happen?
---------------------------------------------------------

An earthquake is caused by a sudden slip on a fault. The tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction.

Where do earthquakes occur in a fault line?
-------------------------------------------

Earthquakes occur along fault lines, cracks in Earth’s crust where tectonic plates meet. They occur where plates are subducting, spreading, slipping, or colliding. As the plates grind together, they get stuck and pressure builds up.

How are earthquakes related to the subduction zone?
---------------------------------------------------

The distribution of earthquake foci along a subduction zone gives an accurate profile of the angle of the descending plate. Most often, plates start subducting at a shallow angle, which becomes steeper with depth.
