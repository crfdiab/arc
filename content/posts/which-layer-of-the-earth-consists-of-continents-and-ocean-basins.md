Which layer of the Earth consists of continents and ocean basins?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Earth’s crust is divided into two types: oceanic crust and continental crust. The transition zone between these two types of crust is sometimes called the Conrad discontinuity. Silicates (mostly compounds made of silicon and oxygen) are the most abundant rocks and minerals in both oceanic and continental crust.

Are ocean basins and continents part of Earth’s plates?
-------------------------------------------------------

Over millions of years, ocean basins open and close, continents move and change shape, and mountains are pushed up and eroded away. Such dynamic processes continually reshape the surface of the Earth. The movement of rigid plates on the Earth’s surface, known as plate tectonics, is the cause of these changes.

What are continents and ocean basins?
-------------------------------------

While the ocean basins lie much lower than sea level, the continents stand high—about 1 km (0.6 mile) above sea level. The physical explanation for this condition is that the continental crust is light and thick while the oceanic crust is dense and thin.

Where are the ocean basins located on the Earth?
------------------------------------------------

The Ocean Basins. The ocean basins cover the largest area of the Earth’s surface. Because of plate tectonics, however, most oceanic lithosphere eventually is subducted. Thus the only existing oceanic lithosphere is younger than about Jurassic in age and occurs at locations farthest from the oceanic spreading centers.

What are the names of the continents that surround the ocean?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The ocean surrounds landmasses known as continents, which constitute the remaining 29% of Earth’s surface. Today’s oceans are traditionally divided by the continents into four major parts or basins: the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian and the Arctic. The continuous body of water that surrounds Antarctica is called the Southern Ocean.

How are continental margins related to ocean basins?
----------------------------------------------------

1 Continental Margins. A continental margin is a part of the ocean basin that is adjacent to a continent. 2 Deep Ocean Basins. Eventually, the continental shelf or continental rise leads to a deep ocean basin. 3 Mid-Ocean Ridges. …

Why are the continents and ocean basins made of different types of rock?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reason for the different levels is that the continents and ocean basins are made up of different kinds of rock. Continental rocks are rich in the light-colored minerals quartz and feldspar, which combine to make up the principal kind of rock in the continent, which is granite (Figure 2-2).
