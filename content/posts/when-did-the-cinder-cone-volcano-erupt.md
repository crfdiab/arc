When did the cinder cone volcano erupt?
---------------------------------------

1666  
Cinder Cone erupted in the year 1666 (about 350 years ago) and consists of five basaltic andesite and andesite lava flows, two cinder cones and a widespread mafic ash-fall deposit.

Do cinder cone volcanoes erupt?
-------------------------------

Cinder cones are the simplest type of volcano. Explosive eruptions caused by gas rapidly expanding and escaping from molten lava formed cinders that fell back around the vent, building up the cone to a height of 1,200 feet. The last explosive eruption left a funnel-shaped crater at the top of the cone.

When was the last time a cinder cone volcano erupted?

How often does a cinder cone volcano erupt?
-------------------------------------------

Many cinder cone volcanoes are monogenetic, which means they erupt just once in their lifetimes – though some continue erupting steadily for decades. A cinder cone eruption is an unforgettable experience, the kind of theatrical, terrifying display of nature’s prowess that volcanoes are famous for.

How tall is the Lava Butte cinder cone volcano?
-----------------------------------------------

Lava Butte is one of the over 400 cinder cone volcanoes that surround the Newberry volcano. Normal cones in this area are generally 200 feet high while some of the larger ones reach 400 feet.

Which is an example of a cinder cone volcano?
---------------------------------------------

Cinder Cone Volcanoes: With Examples. A cinder cone volcano is a steep-sided conical volcano characterized by loose rock fragments from eruptions. These fragments include pyroclastic material, cinders, volcanic ash, scoria, etc. Cinder cone volcanoes can erupt spectacularly shooting lava and volcanic ash high into the air.

Why are cinder cones sometimes called ash cones?
------------------------------------------------

Cinder cones are also sometimes called ash cone volcanoes or parasitic cones, because they leech off bigger volcanoes, making their homes on the sides of shield volcanoes or other mountains.
