What do microorganisms break down?
----------------------------------

However, micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes–even though they go unnoticed in your compost pile–are responsible for most of the organic material breakdown. They are chemical decomposers because they use chemicals in their bodies to break down organic matter.

How do micro-organisms cause decay?
-----------------------------------

The main groups of decomposer organisms are bacteria and fungi. Bacteria are single-celled microscopic organisms. They both cause decay by releasing enzymes which break down compounds in their food so it can be absorbed by their cells. Organisms that feed on dead material in this way are called saprophytes.

How do microorganisms break down dead plants and animals?
---------------------------------------------------------

The decomposers complete the cycle by returning essential molecules to the plant producers. Decomposers (fungi, bacteria, invertebrates such as worms and insects) have the ability to break down dead organisms into smaller particles and create new compounds.

Can be broken down by microorganisms?
-------------------------------------

Biodegradation is the action of microorganisms to decompose a substance into its constituent elements or new compounds. This is the key process by which biodegradable plastics are broken down in the environment.

What is never part of a virus?
------------------------------

Viruses do not have nuclei, organelles, or cytoplasm like cells do, and so they have no way to monitor or create change in their internal environment.

Which microorganism can break down organic matter?
--------------------------------------------------

Scientists call the organisms that decompose organic matter decomposers, saprobes or saprotrophs. Fungi and bacteria are not restricted to decomposing leaves and other plant materials. They will decompose any dead organic matter, whether it is a cardboard box, paint, glue, pair of jeans, a leather jacket or jet fuel.

How are bacteria able to break down food?
-----------------------------------------

How bacteria break down human food. To break them down bacteria use a specific group of enzymes called CAZymes which stands for “Carbohydrate-active enzymes”. As enzymes are very specialised in the molecules that they break down, different CAZymes exist for different complex carbohydrates.

How are dead organisms broken down into smaller pieces?
-------------------------------------------------------

Decomposition. Dead organisms are broken down into smaller pieces by the process of decay. Organisms such as earthworms are involved in this process. Decomposition is the process by which bacteria and fungi break dead organisms into their simple compounds.

How are micro organisms spread from one organism to another?
------------------------------------------------------------

Some pathogens are carried by vectors from one organism to another. For example: mosquitoes carry the malaria protoctistan; rat fleas carried the bacterium that caused the Black Death; houseflies can spread micro-organisms from faeces to our food.

Where do bacteria break down carbohydrate in the body?
------------------------------------------------------

1\) Bacteria in the nose and nasal cavities – unsurprisingly these bacteria tended to have very little carbohydrate metabolising ability (very few people inhale starch) 2) Bacteria in the vagina – These bacteria tended to be breaking down more simple sugars, and also had carbohydrate formin g enzymes in order to build up biofilms
