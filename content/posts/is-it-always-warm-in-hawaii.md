Is it always warm in Hawaii?
----------------------------

Hawaii’s weather is warm all year round with daytime high temperatures ranging from 78F in the “colder” months to 88F in the hotter months. Hawaii’s proximity to the equator means that its weather is tropically warm and consistent throughout the year.

Is 60 degrees cold in Hawaii?
-----------------------------

Nighttime low temperatures have dipped into the – gasp – upper 60’s! Isn’t perception a funny thing? As I’ve mentioned in the 50 Facts About the 50th State Series, Hawaii offers year-round warm temperatures — even in the winter. Lows don’t normally dip down below the mid-60’s.

Why is Hawaii so hot?
---------------------

Sea surface temperatures contribute to the heat by warming up winds that come on shore. And speaking of winds, Hawaii’s natural air conditioner has been fizzing out, too. Throughout the summer, the state has seen several bouts of light or no tradewinds.

What is the average temperature in Honolulu Hawaii?
---------------------------------------------------

Sometimes temperatures can exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), and very rarely, drop just below 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 degrees Celsius). Honolulu receives an average annual rainfall of 17 inches, but that number is much higher in the city’s surrounded mountains.

What is the water temperature in the Hawaiian Islands?
------------------------------------------------------

The Hawaiian Islands’ near-shore water temperatures remain comfortable throughout the year. The average water temperature is 74° F (23.3° C), with a summer high of 80° F (26.7° C).

How is the climate in Hawaii different from other places?
---------------------------------------------------------

In places sheltered by terrain, local air movements are significantly different from winds in exposed localities. Since temperature decreases with elevation by about 3 degrees per thousand feet, Hawaii’s mountains, which extend from sea level to nearly 14,000 feet, contain a climatic range from the tropic to the sub-Arctic.

How is the weather in Oahu in the summer?
-----------------------------------------

Oahu experiences a tropical, semi-arid climate. Summer is mostly dry and hot, with temperatures usually above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius). Sometimes temperatures can exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), and very rarely, drop just below 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 degrees Celsius).
