What are the two types of environmental pollution?
--------------------------------------------------

The different types of pollution include:

- Air pollution.
- Water pollution.
- Soil pollution.
- Radioactive pollution.
- Noise pollution. What are the kinds of environmental pollution?
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    When you think of environmental pollution, it typically comes in seven different types. These include air, water, land, radioactive, thermal, light, and sound pollution.
    
    What are the kinds of pollution?
    --------------------------------
    
    The three major types of pollution are air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution. Sometimes, air pollution is visible.
    
    What are the 7 types of environmental pollution?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    This week, we thought we’d look at the seven major forms of pollution and their effect on the environment.
    
    
    - Water Pollution.
    - Air Pollution.
    - Soil Pollution.
    - Thermal Pollution.
    - Radioactive Pollution.
    - Noise Pollution.
    - Light Pollution.
    
    What is effect pollution?
    -------------------------
    
    Pollution effects are defined as “direct and/or indirect adverse impacts of contaminants on the marine environment, such as harm to living resources and marine ecosystems, including loss of biodiversity, hazards to human health, the hindering of marine activities, including fishing, tourism and recreation and other …
    
    What are the major sources of environmental pollution?
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
    The main sources of pollution are household activities, factories, agriculture and transport. Once they have been released into the environment, the concentration of some pollutants is reduced by dispersion, dilution, deposition or degradation.
    
    What are the different types of environmental pollution?
    --------------------------------------------------------
    
    Environmental pollution is the name given to all factors that are directly or indirectly created by humans, harm the environment and nature, and in short, endanger the life of all living things. The damages people cause to nature and the environment occur in different ways. So there are kinds of environmental pollution.
    
    Which is an example of an environmental problem?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    For example– emission of pollutants from factories are human activities that cause air pollution; on the other hand, forest fire causes air pollution, which is a natural activity. Fumes Exhausted by vehicles.
    
    How is soil pollution different from other types of pollution?
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Compared to the other types of pollution, the effects of soil pollution are a little more obscured, but their implications are very noticeable. The effects of soil pollution are numerous. Specific wastes, such as radioactive waste become particularly hazardous when they are not well-contained.
    
    What kind of pollution is bad for the environment?
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    However, if they put that warmed up water back into the environment, it wreaks havoc on the fish and wildlife because it has less oxygen. This is called thermal pollution. Thermal pollution can be caused by natural forces too like soil erosion giving water more sunlight.
