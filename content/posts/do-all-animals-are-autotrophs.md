Do all animals are autotrophs?
------------------------------

1\. Autotrophs: Plants and algae are generally autotrophs which means they make their own food. – Option B is correct because all animals and fungi are heterotrophs as they can’t produce their own food. They all depend on the autotrophs( primary producers) and on other organisms for food.

Did most animals are autotrophs?
--------------------------------

No, all animals and fungi are not autotrophic. The animals and fungi are heterotrophs.

Is a flower an Autotroph?
-------------------------

Most plants are autotrophs because they make their own food by photosynthesis. But for every rule there is an exception. Actually, it produces two different types of flowers: flowers that self-pollinate (called cleistogamous flowers) and flowers that cross-pollinate with other plants (called chasmogamous flowers).

Can animals reproduce asexually?
--------------------------------

Animals may reproduce asexually through fission, budding, fragmentation, or parthenogenesis.

Can animals be Heterotrophs?
----------------------------

Most opisthokonts and prokaryotes are heterotrophic; in particular, all animals and fungi are heterotrophs. Some animals, such as corals, form symbiotic relationships with autotrophs and obtain organic carbon in this way.

Is Heterotroph unique to animals?
---------------------------------

Are there any animals that are heterotrophs or autotrophs?
----------------------------------------------------------

There are no animals that are autotrophs because all animals are heterotrophs. Plants and bacteria are some organisms that are autotrophs. Are animals autotrophs or heterotrophs?

How are other organisms dependent on autotrophs for food?
---------------------------------------------------------

Other organisms, called heterotrophs, take in autotrophs as food to carry out functions necessary for their life. Thus, heterotrophs – all animals , almost all fungi , as well as most bacteria and protozoa – depend on autotrophs, or primary producers , for the raw materials and fuel they need.

Can a herbivore exist without an autotroph?
-------------------------------------------

Without plants that create sugars from carbon dioxide gas and sunlight via the process of photosynthesis, for example, no herbivorous animals could exist, and no carnivorous animals that eat herbivores could exist. For this reason, autotrophs are often called “producers.”

Why are plants sometimes called producers or autotrophs?
--------------------------------------------------------

Because autotrophs produce their own food, they are sometimes called producers. Plants are the most familiar type of autotroph, but there are many different kinds of autotrophic organisms. Algae, which live in water and whose larger forms are known as seaweed, is autotrophic. Phytoplankton, tiny organisms that live in the ocean, are autotrophs.
