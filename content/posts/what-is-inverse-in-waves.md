What is inverse in waves?
-------------------------

Wave inversion occurs when a traveling wave is flipped upside down when being reflected back into the old medium. This happens during the process of a wave moving through one medium encounters a boundary between that medium and another medium. Rigid waves always invert.

What is the period of a wave called?
------------------------------------

The period of a wave is the time for a particle on a medium to make one complete vibrational cycle. Period, being a time, is measured in units of time such as seconds, hours, days or years. The period of orbit for the Earth around the Sun is approximately 365 days; it takes 365 days for the Earth to complete a cycle.

Why is frequency inverse of period?
-----------------------------------

Frequency is inversely proportional to time period. SI unit of time period is second while frequency is per second or second^-1. Time period is the time taken to complete a cycle of any function while frequency is the number of times a cycle is completed each second.

What is amplitude and frequency?
--------------------------------

Amplitude is an important parameter of waves and is the maximum displacement of points on a wave. Stated another way, amplitude is the vertical distance between a peak or a valley and the equilibrium point. Frequency is the number of wave cycles passing a point per unit time.

What is the inverse square law in simple terms?
-----------------------------------------------

: a statement in physics: a given physical quantity (such as illumination) varies with the distance from the source inversely as the square of the distance.

What is called inverse of frequency \*?
---------------------------------------

Answer: The time it takes to complete a cycle is the period. Frequency is the inverse of this, the number of cycles in a second. The distance sound travels during one period is the wavelength. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency.

Is there a relationship between frequency and amplitude?
--------------------------------------------------------

The higher the frequency, the more energy, and the higher the amplitude, the more energy.

What is the formula for the inverse square law?
-----------------------------------------------

The mathematician will tell you that the Inverse Square Law says that the intensity of a force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from that force. You’ll say, what? Then the mathematician will attempt to clear it up by writing down the Inverse Square Law formula, Intensity = 1/D2.

Why is the frequency inverse to the time period?
------------------------------------------------

Frequency is then cycles per second, and period is seconds per cycle. Each is the inverse of the other. But by convention, period is expressed simply in seconds; “per cycle” is understood as part of the definition of period.

How is the period of a wave related to its frequency?
-----------------------------------------------------

In a transverse wave, the wave direction is perpendicular the the direction that the string oscillates in. The period of a wave is indirectly proportional to the frequency of the wave: T= 1 f T = 1 f. The speed of a wave is proportional to the wavelength and indirectly proportional to the period of the wave: v= λ T v = λ T.

Is the inverse of the wavelength called the spatial frequency?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The inverse of the wavelength is called the spatial frequency. Wavelength is commonly designated by the Greek letter lambda (λ). The term wavelength is also sometimes applied to modulated waves, and to the sinusoidal envelopes of modulated waves or waves formed by interference of several sinusoids.

How to calculate the period of a wavelength?
--------------------------------------------

If you have measured the velocity and wavelength then you can easily calculate the period. Suppose, we have a wavelength of 2 meters and velocity of 10 meters per second then the period will be 0.2 sec. I hope this post will be beneficial for you and if you have any query you can write it down in the comments section.
