What are some things that orbit around our sun besides our planets?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The solar system is made up of the sun and everything that orbits around it, including planets, moons, asteroids, comets and meteoroids.

What objects orbit the Sun’s space?
-----------------------------------

Asteroids, comets, Kuiper Belt Objects—all kinds of small bodies of rock, metal and ice are in constant motion as they orbit the Sun.

What keeps objects in orbit around other objects?
-------------------------------------------------

Objects orbit each other because of gravity. Gravity is the force that exists between any two objects with mass. The more massive the object, the larger its gravitational pull. Gravitational pull is the amount of force one object exerts on another object.

Which planet has the slowest orbit around the sun?
--------------------------------------------------

Venus  
In fact, Venus takes 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis – the slowest rotation of any planet – and its rotation is retrograde to its orbital path. Combined with its orbital period, this means that a single solar day on Venus (the time between one sunup to the next) is 117 Earth days.

How do the planets stay in orbit around the Sun?
------------------------------------------------

How do the planets stay in orbit around the sun? The Solar System was formed from a rotating cloud of gas and dust which spun around a newly forming star, our Sun, at its center. The planets all formed from this spinning disk-shaped cloud, and continued this rotating course around the Sun after they were formed.

Why does the farthest reaches of our Solar System have strange orbits?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The strange orbits of some objects in the farthest reaches of our solar system, hypothesised by some astronomers to be shaped by an unknown ninth planet, can instead be explained by the combined gravitational force of small objects orbiting the Sun beyond Neptune, say researchers.

Where is the Sun located in the Solar System?
---------------------------------------------

Learners should be familiar with the fact that the Sun is a star located at the centre of the solar system and they should understand that the planets orbit around the Sun. They should also be aware that there are two types of planets: smaller rocky planets and larger gas giants.

What makes an object orbit around another object?
-------------------------------------------------

An orbit is the path an object takes in space as it revolves around another object. While a planet travels in one direction, it is also affected by the Sun’s gravity causing it to take a curved route that eventually brings it back to its starting point.
