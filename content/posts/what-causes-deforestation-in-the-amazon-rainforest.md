What causes deforestation in the Amazon rainforest?
---------------------------------------------------

Ranching is the leading cause of deforestation in the Brazillian Amazon. Ranching involves clearing an area of rainforest then rearing cattle on the land.

What happens when the Amazon trees are cut down?
------------------------------------------------

Storing carbon, distributing water If all trees were cut down and burned, the forest’s carbon storage capacity would be lost to the atmosphere. If the Amazon’s cloud systems and its capacity to recycle water were to be disrupted, the ecosystem would tip over and irreversibly turn into dry savannah very quickly.

Why are so many trees being cut down?
-------------------------------------

The simple answer is that the trees are being cut down (known as coppicing) for the benefit of the woodland, the wildlife, and the flora. These are classified as standards and tend to be larger and older trees. Keeping them intact will increase diversification of wildlife and create larger timber in latter years.

Does 5G damage trees?
---------------------

As for the 5G or/and culpability of the radiation, currently, no research links it to withered trees. Therefore, the statement that 5G antennas damage pine trees is false and isn’t backed up by scientific researches.

Do trees interfere with 5G?
---------------------------

“Trees are cut down because they block 5G signals and, in addition to this, more space is required for new transmitter antennas.” Trees, buildings, vehicles and even rain can influence how 5G signals propagate.

How is the Amazon rainforest being cut down?
--------------------------------------------

Managed by the Brazilian Development Bank, the Amazon Fund raises money from international donors to prevent, monitor and combat deforestation. And while Norway has donated billions to support conservation of rainforests, official Brazilian figures indicate that they are being cut down at their fastest rate in more than a decade.

What are the main causes of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Below are some of the primary concerns, which are either directly caused by people, or are the result of climatic changes brought on by human activity in the area. One of the leading causes of deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest is linked to beef consumption.

Why is logging bad for the Amazon rainforest?
---------------------------------------------

Little consideration is given to safeguard timber stocks for future harvests, and this leads to the usual litany of biodiversity loss, over-hunting of wildlife and subsequent conversion for agriculture or pasture. Although selected logging targets specific commercially valuable trees, logging methods usually result in collateral damage.

Why is it important to preserve the Amazon rainforest?
------------------------------------------------------

Experts agree that by leaving the rainforests intact and harvesting it’s many nuts, fruits, oil-producing plants, and medicinal plants, the rainforest has more economic value than if they were cut down to make grazing land for cattle or for timber.
