What is freshwater and saltwater?
---------------------------------

Freshwater is found in ponds, lakes, rivers, streams, and wetlands. Marine environments contain saltwater. Saltwater Marine environments include the ocean, coral reefs and estuaries. Saltwater requires a higher concentration of salt to maintain a suitable salinity for fish.

How much salt can a plant tolerate?
-----------------------------------

Also, some salts are toxic to plants when present in high concentration. The highly tolerant crops can withstand a salt concentration of the saturation extract up to 10 g/l. The moderately tolerant crops can withstand salt concentration up to 5 g/l. The limit of the sensitive group is about 2.5 g/l.

Which is heavier sea water or fresh water?
------------------------------------------

Increasing the mass by adding salt increases the density. Seawater is a little bit more dense than fresh water so it sinks beneath freshwater. This means that when rivers flow out into the sea the river freshwater floats on top of the sea water.

What’s the difference between saltwater and freshwater water?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The salinity of different bodies of water hinders organisms from thriving in both saltwater and freshwater. Some plants and animals survive in one type of water but not the other. Another considerable difference between the two is their density. Saltwater has a higher density than freshwater because of the sodium chloride it contains.

Is the ocean a freshwater or saltwater ecosystem?
-------------------------------------------------

Some wetlands have salty water, so wetlands are not always considered to be a freshwater ecosystem. Ocean life is incredibly diverse. From the largest whale to the smallest plankton, the ocean is filled with wonders. Coral reefs, dolphins and a huge array of fish call saltwater ecosystems their home.

Is the Mediterranean Sea salt water or fresh water?
---------------------------------------------------

Answer Wiki. All seas are large salty bodies of water that are surround whole or in part by land – with the only exception being the Sargasso Sea which is bounded by four ocean currents.
