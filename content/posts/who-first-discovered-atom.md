Who first discovered atom?
--------------------------

Democritus  
Democritus first introduced the idea of the atom almost 2500 years ago. Democritus was an important philosopher.

When was the atom first theorized?
----------------------------------

5th century bc  
The ancient atomic theory was proposed in the 5th century bc by the Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus and was revived in the 1st century bc by the Roman philosopher and poet Lucretius.

When were molecules and atoms discovered?
-----------------------------------------

A modern conceptualization of molecules began to develop in the 19th century along with experimental evidence for pure chemical elements and how individual atoms of different chemical elements such as hydrogen and oxygen can combine to form chemically stable molecules such as water molecules.

Who named atom?
---------------

But when it comes to the word atom, we have to go to ancient Greece of 400 B.C. And there was a brilliant philosopher named Democritus, and he proposed the Greek word atomos, which means uncuttable. And so as he explained, all matter was eventually reducible to discrete, small particles or atomos.

Can atoms be created?
---------------------

According to Dalton’s Atomic Theory, Atoms of one element cannot be changed into atoms of a different element by chemical reactions and atoms can neither be created nor destroyed in chemical reactions.

Why did Dalton use the word atom?
---------------------------------

In Greek, the prefix “a” means “not” and the word “tomos” means cut. Our word atom therefore comes from atomos, a Greek word meaning uncuttable. In 1803, John Dalton formulated the “atomic theory” of matter based on experiments that quantified the weights of elements formed when compounds were broken down.

Why was Dalton wrong about the atom?
------------------------------------

The indivisibility of an atom was proved wrong: an atom can be further subdivided into protons, neutrons and electrons. According to Dalton, the atoms of same element are similar in all respects. However, atoms of some elements vary in their masses and densities. These atoms of different masses are called isotopes.

When did j.j.thomson discover the atom?
---------------------------------------

And so with all this in mind, our understanding of the atom would continue to evolve. In 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered that atoms were, in fact, not the smallest you could go in terms of particles. At the time, he was experimenting with cathode rays and electric discharge, and while investigating a mysterious glow, he discovered electrons.

Why was the discovery of the atom so important?
-----------------------------------------------

An atom is the smallest particle of any element and the basic building block of matter. Since atoms are the key to understanding chemistry and physics, Dalton’s discovery of the atom ranks as one of the great turning points for science. Because of this discovery, Dalton is often called the father of modern physical science.

How did John Dalton discover the smallest atom?
-----------------------------------------------

In 1802, John Dalton discovered that an atom is the smallest particle that can exist of any chemical element. Prof. Ashoka tells us how it was discovered, exclusively in Different Truths. Why Is This One of the 100 Greatest? The modern worlds of chemistry and physics depend on knowing and studying the universe of atoms.

Who was the first person to see an atom?
----------------------------------------

But no one could actually see an atom until the invention of the electron microscope, in 1938. Centuries before that, atoms were well known and were an important part of chemistry and physics research. It was John Dalton who defined the atom, allowing scientists to being serious study at the atomic level.
