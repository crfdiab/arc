What are the risks of atherectomy?
----------------------------------

Atherectomy usually has no complications, but as with any surgery, there is a risk of complications, such as embolization (the dislodgement of debris that blocks the arteries in the lower part of the leg) and perforation. These complications, however, are rare.

How long does it take to recover from an atherectomy?
-----------------------------------------------------

Most people spend 1 to 2 days in the hospital after a scheduled atherectomy. If you don’t have any complications, you will complete the rest of your recovery at home. If atherectomy was an emergency treatment for a heart attack, your hospital stay will be longer.

Who is a candidate for atherectomy?
-----------------------------------

You may be a candidate for coronary atherectomy if: You have angina (chest pain) and shortness of breath with mild or moderate exertion.

Is rotational atherectomy safe?
-------------------------------

In patients with severely calcified coronary lesions, planned rotational atherectomy appears to be a safe treatment strategy, yielding reduced procedural and fluoroscopy times and the number of predilation balloon catheters used compared with provisional atherectomy, according to findings from the ROTATE multicenter …

Why do people need atherectomy?
-------------------------------

An atherectomy is a procedure to remove plaque from an artery (blood vessel). Removing plaque makes the artery wider, so blood can flow more freely to the heart muscles. In an atherectomy, the plaque is shaved or vaporized away with tiny rotating blades or a laser on the end of a catheter (a thin, flexible tube).

What is the difference between endarterectomy and atherectomy?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The most recent development, however, known as an atherectomy removes the plaque from the artery. This achieves the same result of the surgical option (endarterectomy) but with the safety and convenience of a minimally invasive endovascular procedure.

When is a atherectomy done?
---------------------------

This procedure is used to treat peripheral artery disease and coronary artery disease. An atherectomy is sometimes performed on patients with very hard plaque or on patients who have already had angioplasty and stents, but who still have plaque blocking the flow of blood.

What is surgically removed during an atherectomy?
-------------------------------------------------

Extraction Atherectomy The procedure removes fat and calcium buildup (atherosclerosis) in the heart’s arteries. During the procedure, a thin flexible tube (a catheter) is inserted through an artery in the groin or arm and carefully guided into the coronary artery that is narrowed.

What is rotablator atherectomy?
-------------------------------

Rotational atherectomy (RA) is an endovascular procedure to ablate atherosclerotic plaque by forward advancement of a rotating abrasive burr. The Rotablator Rotational Atherectomy System (Figure 1; Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) has been commercially available for use in the coronary arteries for the past 3 decades.

What is a common postoperative complication of carotid artery disease?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Perioperative complications of carotid endarterectomy include stroke, myocardial infarction, and death, and postoperative complications are cranial nerve injuries, wound hematoma, hypertension, hypotension, hyperperfusion syndrome, intracerebral hemorrhage, seizures, and recurrent stenosis.

Is atherectomy better than angioplasty?
---------------------------------------

The authors conclude that directional coronary atherectomy provides better clinical and angiographic outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease than primary stenting during angioplasty.

When is atherectomy used?
-------------------------

What are the risks and benefits of an atherectomy?
--------------------------------------------------

Most people return to normal activities within a week. However, if you are recovering from a heart attack, your stay and recovery will be longer. Major complications are rare with atherectomy compared to heart bypass surgery. But there are potential risks with any procedure, including atherectomy.

What are the different types of atherectomy procedures?
-------------------------------------------------------

Do you need general anesthesia after an atherectomy?
----------------------------------------------------

No general anesthesia is needed and patients can return to normal activity the day after the procedure. Atherectomy is not performed on every patient with peripheral artery disease. You and your physician will decide whether a directional or rotational atherectomy is right for your circumstance.

How long do you stay in the hospital after an atherectomy?
----------------------------------------------------------

And the incision in your arm or leg is quite small compared to heart surgery. With atherectomy, you will likely stay a day or two in the hospital instead of several days with surgery. Most people return to normal activities within a week. However, if you are recovering from a heart attack, your stay and recovery will be longer.
