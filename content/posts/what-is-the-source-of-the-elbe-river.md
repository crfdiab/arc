The Elbe River is one of the major rivers in Western Europe. From its spring in the Giant Mountains (Czech Republic) to its mouth at the North Sea near Cuxhaven (Germany) it covers a distance of 1,091 kilometres.

Which way does the Elbe river flow?
-----------------------------------

northwest  
Elbe River, Czech Labe, one of the major waterways of central Europe. It runs from the Czech Republic through Germany to the North Sea, flowing generally to the northwest. The river rises on the southern side of the Krkonoše (Giant) Mountains near the border of the Czech Republic and Poland.

What are the major tributaries of the Elbe river?
-------------------------------------------------

The Elbe’s major tributaries include the rivers Vltava, Saale, Havel, Mulde, Schwarze Elster, and Ohře. The Elbe river basin, comprising the Elbe and its tributaries, has a catchment area of 148,268 square kilometres (57,247 sq mi), the fourth largest in Europe.

Where does the Elbe river go in Germany?
----------------------------------------

However, during storms the water may rise much higher, occasionally even flooding parts of the city. By means of the Elbe and its connecting waterways, vessels from Hamburg can navigate to Berlin, the central and southern sections of eastern Germany, and the Czech Republic.

How big is the channel of the Elbe river?
-----------------------------------------

The estuary proper of the Elbe ( Unterelbe) extends from Hamburg to Cuxhaven, a distance of about 55 miles. It varies in width from one to two miles, but much of it is occupied by mud flats and sandbanks. The main channel is buoyed and dredged. At high tide the channel has a depth of some 53 feet (16 metres).

What kind of cargo does the Elbe River carry?
---------------------------------------------

The Elbe itself is navigable for 1,000-ton barges as far as Prague through the Vltava. In eastern Germany it serves the river ports of Magdeburg, Schönebeck, Aken, Dessau, Torgau, Riesa, and Dresden, carrying bituminous coal, lignite, coke, metal, potash, grain, and piece goods.
