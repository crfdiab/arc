What makes a rainforest an ecosystem?
-------------------------------------

Biome is another name for a distinct type of ecosystem. The tropical rainforest biome has four main characteristics: very high annual rainfall, high average temperatures, nutrient-poor soil, and high levels of biodiversity (species richness).

What are the 4 ecosystems of the Amazon rainforest?
---------------------------------------------------

Reflecting environmental conditions as well as past human influence, the Amazon is made up of a mosaic of ecosystems and vegetation types including rainforests, seasonal forests, deciduous forests, flooded forests, and savannas.

How does the rainforest help us?
--------------------------------

As well as the vivid beauty that comes with great diversity in plants and animals, rainforests also play a practical role in keeping our planet healthy. By absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing the oxygen that we depend on for our survival. The absorption of this CO2 also helps to stabilize the Earth’s climate.

Why do we need the rainforest?
------------------------------

Rainforests are often called the lungs of the planet for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and increasing local humidity. Rainforests also stabilize climate, house incredible amounts of plants and wildlife, and produce nourishing rainfall all around the planet.

What kind of ecosystem is a rain forest?
----------------------------------------

What is a rainforest ecosystem? A rainforest is a dense area of jungle that gets a high amount of rainfall. A rain forest is a particularly humid, thick type of forest that is typically found in the tropical regions of the world. Rainforests are very bio-diverse and they tend to be thought of as having their own distinct ecosystems.

How is the biome of a rainforest complex?
-----------------------------------------

Rainforest Ecosystem. Rainforest biome is very complex. It includes a myriad of different species of plants and animals that are all adapted to rain, and lots of it. © Poster by AllPosters. There are different levels of plants in the rainforests. The highest are the tall trees that often, particularly in tropical rainforests, form a closed canopy.

What are the characteristics of the tropical rainforest?
--------------------------------------------------------

One of the primary characteristics of the rainforest ecosystem is that it receives an average rainfall between 80 inches and 430 inches annually. The rainforest is found in an area of wet tropical climatic conditions.

Where are tropical rainforests found in the world?
--------------------------------------------------

Rainforests can be found in tropical areas of Australia, Southeast Asia, Africa, and South and Central America. As the name implies, the ecosystem of a tropical rainforest is ruled by the rain. Some typical characteristic of rainforest climates are: high humidity of 77% to 88% all year round
