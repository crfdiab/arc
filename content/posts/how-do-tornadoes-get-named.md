How do tornadoes get named?
---------------------------

They began in 1953 using American female names. Apparently they were running out of female names, so in 1978 they began using male names. Over 1,000 tornadoes will hit the United States each year. I would recommend that tornadoes be named after vicious animals and poisonous snakes.

Are tornadoes associated with hurricanes?
-----------------------------------------

Hurricanes and tropical storms, collectively known as tropical cyclones, provide all the necessary ingredients to form tornadoes. First, most hurricanes carry with them individual supercells, which are rotating, well-organized thunderstorms. Most hurricanes that make landfall create tornadoes, McNoldy said.

Why do Hurricanes get their names after humans?
-----------------------------------------------

This leads us to the question as to why these storm systems get named after humans, and more specifically, given female names up till recently. The answer to both questions is quite logical and makes sense if you look at the reasoning behind the decision to give them human names.

Are there any Hurricanes named after innocent people?
-----------------------------------------------------

DORIAN and Irma are both innocent names that will bring terrible memories for those whose lives were devastated by category 5 hurricanes in 2019 and 2017. But how are storm names chosen – and which names are banned from the list? Here’s all you need to know.

When does a tropical storm get its name?
----------------------------------------

When does a storm receive a name? Tropical storms are given names when they display a rotating circulation pattern and wind speeds of 39 miles per hour (63 kilometers per hour). A tropical storm develops into a hurricane when wind speeds reach 74 mph (119 kph).

What are the names of the recent hurricanes?
--------------------------------------------

Especially in the United States, you don’t have to think too hard to remember hurricanes that were especially devastating in recent times. Names like Katrina, Harvey, and Sandy immediately springs to mind. And these just occurred during the early part of this century.
