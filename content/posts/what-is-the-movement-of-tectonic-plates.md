What is the movement of tectonic plates?
----------------------------------------

The heat from radioactive processes within the planet’s interior causes the plates to move, sometimes toward and sometimes away from each other. This movement is called plate motion, or tectonic shift.

What is plate tectonics short answer?
-------------------------------------

Plate tectonics is the theory that Earth’s outer shell is divided into large slabs of solid rock, called “plates,” that glide over Earth’s mantle, the rocky inner layer above Earth’s core. It lubricates the undersides of Earth’s tectonic plates, allowing the lithosphere to move around.

What are the 3 movement of tectonic plates?
-------------------------------------------

The movement of the plates creates three types of tectonic boundaries: convergent, where plates move into one another; divergent, where plates move apart; and transform, where plates move sideways in relation to each other.

How and why do tectonic plates move?
------------------------------------

If a plate with oceanic lithosphere meets another plate, the dense oceanic lithosphere dives beneath the other plate and sinks into the mantle. This process is called subduction. The sinking oceanic lithosphere drags the rest of the tectonic plate and this is the main cause of plate motion.

Which is the best definition of a tectonic plate?
-------------------------------------------------

A tectonic plate (also called lithospheric plate) is a massive, irregularly shaped slab of solid rock, generally composed of both continental and oceanic lithosphere. Continental crust is composed of granitic rocks which are made up of relatively lightweight minerals such as quartz and feldspar.

Which is true about the movement of tectonic plates?
----------------------------------------------------

Study co-author Professor Sergei Pisarevskiy says plate tectonics is the study of the horizontal movement of tectonic plates over the Earth’s surface. “This is not uniform movement,” he says. “Sometimes there are periods where there was very quick movement all together globally,…

What causes tectonic plates to sink and pull together?
------------------------------------------------------

They start to sink and pull the warmer parts of the plate with them. Out of all these three forces, researchers agree that the slab pull is the most relevant one. It is the biggest driving force behind all of the tectonic plate movement. However, the main force that is behind all of the previously mentioned forces is gravity itself.

How are the cratons connected to the tectonic plates?
-----------------------------------------------------

The cratons are connected by orogenic belts, regions of highly deformed rock where the tectonic plates have engaged.

Why do some plates move faster than others?
-------------------------------------------

One is the inconsistent rate at which plates appear to move, both individually and relative to each other. “For example Africa moved very slowly for the last few hundred million years, on the other hand India as you probably know moved very fast,” he says.
