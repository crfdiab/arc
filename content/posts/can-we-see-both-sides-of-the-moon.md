Can we see both sides of the Moon?
----------------------------------

As the Earth is much larger than the Moon, the Moon’s rotation is slowed down until it reaches a balance point. As this NASA animation shows (right), this means that the same portion of the Moon always faces towards the Earth, and we can never see the far side.

Do we see all sides of the Moon each month?
-------------------------------------------

The Moon orbits Earth once every 27.3 days and spins on its axis once every 27.3 days. This means that although the Moon is rotating, it always keeps one face toward us. Known as “synchronous rotation,” this is why we only ever see the Moon’s nearside from Earth.

Does the side of the Moon visible to us change?
-----------------------------------------------

From Earth, the Moon’s surface looks dark because the illuminated side is facing away from Earth. As our Moon continues its orbit counterclockwise around Earth (viewed from above the north pole), more and more of the illuminated part of the Moon becomes visible to us, until it reaches the “full Moon” stage.

How is the Moon visible to us?
------------------------------

The moon shines because its surface reflects light from the sun. At any given point in the moon’s trajectory around the Earth, only half of its surface is facing the sun, and therefore, only half of the moon is lit up. The other half of the surface faces away from the sun and is in shadow.

Why is only one side of the Moon visible to the US?
---------------------------------------------------

There is only one side of the moon visible to all of Earth. It means that during one orbit around Earth the moon does exactly one rotation around its own axis, so that always the same part of its surface is turned towards Earth.

How much of the Moon can be seen from Earth?
--------------------------------------------

One side of the moon always faces Earth. Even so, over time, it’s possible to see as much as 59% of the moon’s surface, due to lunar libration.

When does the far side of the moon face the Sun?
------------------------------------------------

At that point, the far side of the Moon is facing the Sun. This phase is called a new moon. During the new moon, the side facing Earth is dark.

Which is The Dark Side of the Moon?
-----------------------------------

“For one reason or another, one side was favored over the other,” Keller said. Left: An image of the dark side of the moon – the side of the moon never visible to Earth – taken by NASA’s Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera. Photo by NASA.
