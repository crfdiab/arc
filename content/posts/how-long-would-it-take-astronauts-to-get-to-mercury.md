How long would to it take to get to Mars by rocket?
---------------------------------------------------

All in all, your trip to Mars would take about 21 months: 9 months to get there, 3 months there, and 9 months to get back. With our current rocket technology, there is no way around this. The long duration of trip has several implications.

Has a rocket Been to Mercury?
-----------------------------

Two spacecraft have visited the planet Mercury so far. The first was called Mariner 10. During 1974 and 1975, Mariner 10 flew by Mercury three times and mapped about half of the planet’s surface. Mariner 10 also discovered Mercury’s thin atmosphere and detected its magnetic field.

When was the first Mercury rocket launched into space?
------------------------------------------------------

It was used for six sub-orbital Mercury flights from 1960–61; culminating with the launch of the first, and 11 weeks later, the second American (and the second and third humans) in space. The four subsequent Mercury human spaceflights used the more powerful Atlas booster to enter low Earth orbit .

How long does it take to get to Mercury from Earth?
---------------------------------------------------

How long it would take to travel to Mercury would depend on where Earth and Mercury were in their orbits at the time a spacecraft started its journey from Earth, and also on the path chosen. For example, Mariner 10 was launched on November 3, 1973 and it arrived at Mercury on March 29, 1974. Continue the conversation on Twitter Facebook Contact Us

How long would it take a rocket to get to Jupiter?
--------------------------------------------------

Let’s assume that our rocket is going at the speed of light, which is 186,282 miles per second. That means it would take around 43 minutes to get to Jupiter if we traveled at the speed of light. The problem is that we cannot travel at the speed of light, but we can travel to Jupiter in a man-made rocket.

How fast does a rocket have to travel to get into space?
--------------------------------------------------------

If you want to completely escape Earth’s gravity and travel to another moon or planet, though, you need to be going even faster – at a speed of at least 7 miles per second or about 25,000 miles per hour. Continue the conversation on Twitter
