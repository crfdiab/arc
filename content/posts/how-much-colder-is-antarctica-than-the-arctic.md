How much colder is Antarctica than the Arctic?
----------------------------------------------

Scientists registered this staggeringly cold temperature on the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in 2013, after analysing 32 years of satellite data. The coldest temperature in the Arctic was 23.7°C (42.6°F) warmer than the Antarctic record.

Why is Antarctic colder than the Arctic?
----------------------------------------

Both the Arctic (North Pole) and the Antarctic (South Pole) are cold because they don’t get any direct sunlight. The Arctic is ocean surrounded by land. The Antarctic is land surrounded by ocean. The ocean under the Arctic ice is cold, but still warmer than the ice!

Which is coldest north or south pole?
-------------------------------------

The highest temperature recorded at the north pole is +5°C (+41°F) while at the south pole it is -13.5°C ( +7.7°F). The coldest temperature ever recorded on earth was -89.2°C (-128.6°F) on July 21st 1983 at the Russian base at the Southern Geomagnetic Pole in Antarctica.

Which is colder polar or arctic?
--------------------------------

Arctic air tends to be colder than polar air. In the air mass source regions, the temperatures of arctic air can reach far below 0 F, such as in the -30’s to -40’s below zero. Polar air tends to not start out as cold as this.

What’s the coldest place on Earth?
----------------------------------

Oymyakon  
Oymyakon is the coldest permanently-inhabited place on Earth and is found in the Arctic Circle’s Northern Pole of Cold. In 1933, it recorded its lowest temperature of -67.7°C.

Which is colder the Arctic or the Antarctica?
---------------------------------------------

The Arctic is ocean surrounded by land. The Antarctic is land surrounded by ocean. The ocean under the Arctic ice is cold, but still warmer than the ice! So the ocean warms the air a bit. Antarctica is dry—and high. Under the ice and snow is land, not ocean. And it’s got mountains. The average elevation of Antarctica is about 7,500 feet (2.3 km).

Which is the coldest continent in the world?
--------------------------------------------

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km (1.2 mi; 6,200 ft) in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula . Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average elevation of all the continents.

Why is the temperature in Antarctica going up?
----------------------------------------------

Continued success in addressing the ozone hole, along with fossil fuel emissions, may cause Antarctic temperatures to rise more rapidly in future decades. The Antarctic Peninsula—lower in elevation and closer to the equator—experienced rapid temperature increases for several decades in the twentieth century.

How big is Antarctica compared to the Southern Ocean?
-----------------------------------------------------

It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At 14,200,000 square kilometres (5,500,000 square miles), it is the fifth-largest continent and nearly twice the size of Australia.
