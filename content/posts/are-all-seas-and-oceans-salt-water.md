Are all seas and oceans salt water?
-----------------------------------

The oceans cover about 70 percent of the Earth’s surface, and that about 97 percent of all water on and in the Earth is saline—there’s a lot of salty water on our planet. Find out here how the water in the seas became salty.

Are oceans fresh or saltwater?
------------------------------

Saltwater, which is found in earth’s oceans and seas, is quite different from the freshwater contained within lakes, rivers and streams across the globe. Plant and animal species are adapted to live in one type of water or the other, but few can thrive in both.

Are there non salt water oceans?
--------------------------------

The planet’s freshest (least saline) sea water is in the eastern parts of Gulf of Finland and in the northern end of Gulf of Bothnia, both part of the Baltic Sea.

Why do seas and oceans have salt water?
---------------------------------------

Salt in the sea, or ocean salinity, is mainly caused by rain washing mineral ions from the land into water. Carbon dioxide in the air dissolves into rainwater, making it slightly acidic. When rain falls, it weathers rocks, releasing mineral salts that separate into ions.

Is the Pacific Ocean a salt water ocean?
----------------------------------------

The Pacific Ocean is a salt water ocean.All oceans and seas and bays connected to oceans are salt water. They all have pretty nearly the same amount of salt, about 3.5% by weight. 96.5% of all water on Earth is salt water in oceans, seas and bays.

Why are all seas composed of salt water?
----------------------------------------

All seas are composed of salt water. This is as a result of the presence basalt which forms the floor of the seas and oceans. Where can you find salt water?

What’s the difference between the ocean and the sea?
----------------------------------------------------

Oceans are vast bodies of water covering around 70% of the earth’s surface. On the other hand, seas are smaller bodies which land partially encloses. Thus, you see that the five oceans of our earth are just one large interconnected water body. On the contrary, we have around 50 smaller seas that are spread throughout the world.

Which is the ocean with the most salt?
--------------------------------------

Located between Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east, the Pacific Ocean has the most salt because parts experience excess evaporation, which leaves the water more dense and salty. The oceans are salty, which makes them unsuitable for drinking.
