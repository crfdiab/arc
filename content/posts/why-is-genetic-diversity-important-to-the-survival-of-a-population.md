Why is genetic diversity important to the survival of a population?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Genetic diversity is important because it helps maintain the health of a population, by including alleles that may be valuable in resisting diseases, pests and other stresses. If the environment changes, a population that has a higher variability of alleles will be better able to evolve to adapt to the new environment.

How can genetic variation benefit a species?
--------------------------------------------

Genetic variation in a group of organisms enables some organisms to survive better than others in the environment in which they live. Organisms of even a small population can differ strikingly in terms of how well suited they are for life in a certain environment.

Why is it important for a species to survive?
---------------------------------------------

Genetic diversity of plants, animals and other living organisms is what enables them to survive and thrive in this world. The capacity of species to adapt to new circumstances, whether this is resource scarcity, a changing environment or other disturbances to their natural environment, depends on genetic diversity.

Why do we need genetic variation?
---------------------------------

Genetic variation is an important force in evolution as it allows natural selection to increase or decrease frequency of alleles already in the population. Genetic variation is advantageous to a population because it enables some individuals to adapt to the environment while maintaining the survival of the population.

What is the main cause of endangered species?
---------------------------------------------

Species become endangered for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation. A loss of habitat can happen naturally. Human activity can also contribute to a loss of habitat. Development for housing, industry, and agriculture reduces the habitat of native organisms.

What helps in the survival of organisms?
----------------------------------------

Every organism has a unique ecosystem within which it lives. This ecosystem is its natural habitat. This is where the basic needs of the organism to survive are met: food, water, shelter from the weather and place to breed its young. All organisms need to adapt to their habitat to be able to survive.

How does genetic diversity affect population size?
--------------------------------------------------

Genetic drift can result in the loss of rare alleles, and can decrease the size of the gene pool. Genetic drift can also cause a new population to be genetically distinct from its original population, which has led to the hypothesis that genetic drift plays a role in the evolution of new species.

What would happen if there was no genetic variation?
----------------------------------------------------

Without genetic variation, a population cannot evolve in response to changing environmental variables and, as a result, may face an increased risk of extinction. But if they do not exist — if the right genetic variation is not present — the population will not evolve and could be wiped out by the disease.

Why is genetic diversity important for the survival of a population?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

: In this comprehensive review, a range of factors is considered that may influence the significance of genetic diversity for the survival of a population. Genetic variation is essential for the adaptability of a population in which quantitatively inherited, fitness-related traits are crucial.

Why is lack of genetic diversity a problem?
-------------------------------------------

It can also create physiological or behavioral problems that stem from the lack of genetic variation including poor biochemical balance, malformed physical structure, improper organ formation and function and disease susceptibility. Inbreeding is therefore a serious problem for organisms and organism populations.

How does loss of genetic diversity affect species?
--------------------------------------------------

Although loss of genetic diversity has been thought to be a threat to rare species for a long time, it has also been found to be effective on widespread species with large populations \[4, 10,11\].

Why is genetic diversity important for agricultural monocultures?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Absence or low genetic diversity is also in part what makes agricultural monocultures more susceptible to disease. Many studies have also highlighted how species diversity (i.e. biodiversity) and genetic diversity are inter-linked, inter-dependent and equally important.
