What is the yearly Travelling of animals called?
------------------------------------------------

Migration  
Migration, in ethology, the regular, usually seasonal, movement of all or part of an animal population to and from a given area. Familiar migrants include many birds; hoofed animals, especially in East Africa and in the Arctic tundra; bats; whales and porpoises; seals; and fishes, such as salmon.

What is it called when an animal travels?
-----------------------------------------

Animal migration is the relatively long-distance movement of individual animals, usually on a seasonal basis. It is the most common form of migration in ecology. It is found in all major animal groups, including birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and crustaceans.

What are the types of animal migration?
---------------------------------------

Four additional terms classify migrations based on the different ways animals behave. Complete migration, partial migration, differential migration, and interruptive migration are all terms to describe which or when individuals within the species migrate.

Where do animals migrate?
-------------------------

Some animals travel relatively short distances to find food or more favorable living or breeding conditions. Most animals that migrate do so to find food or more livable conditions. Some animals migrate to breed. The Atlantic Salmon begins its life in a river and migrates downstream to the ocean.

Which fish swims the farthest?
------------------------------

New York February 6, 2017 – An international team of scientists has confirmed that the dorado catfish (Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii) of the Amazon River basin holds the record for the world’s longest exclusively freshwater fish migration, an epic life-cycle journey stretching nearly the entire width of the South …

How do animals find their way back home?
----------------------------------------

Most species migrate during specific seasons, in search of food or water, or for mating reasons. Different species obey different internal and external signals that cue their migration. Animals find their way by using an internal compass and mental maps, as well as other cues, to help them navigate.

What is the greatest migration on earth?
----------------------------------------

The tiny Arctic tern makes the world’s longest migration annually as it zigzags 55,923 miles between the Arctic and Antarctic. An honorable mention goes to the sooty sheerwater for making a similar journey.

When do animals migrate from one place to another?
--------------------------------------------------

Many mammals, birds, fish, insects and other animals travel regularly from one place to another during a certain time of the year. This journey is called migration.

What kind of animals travel for long distances?
-----------------------------------------------

A few types of butterflies are also long-distance travelers. The monarch butterfly, for instance, spends most of the winter in Mexico and then travels back to the United States in the spring. Mammals do not migrate so much because walking is slow and takes up too much time.

How many kilometers do animals travel across land and water?
------------------------------------------------------------

Some animals travel thousands of kilometers across land and water. Others travel only short distances. Water animals, for example, often move vertically from deeper water to the surface area. Birds are animals that travel the greatest distances.

Why do some animals travel farther than others?
-----------------------------------------------

For example, aerial and marine animals can get a helping hand from strong winds and currents, while land animals do everything under their own steam. So the ultimate traveller is partly a matter of opinion. But these are the contenders. Let’s start in the sea. Whales clock up some serious mileage on their seasonal migrations.
