Why is farming important in Mesopotamia?
----------------------------------------

Before learning how to control the growth and harvest of crops, Mesopotamian peasants would have to move from place to place to follow food which had already been planted. The knowledge of farming gave Mesopotamians a chance to settle in one place for a length of time, and therefore establish civilization.

What was the development of farming in ancient Mesopotamia?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The following are raw research notes on the development of farming in Ancient Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia, as was Egypt, was blessed with yearly flooding from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Unlike Egypt, Mesopotamia was inundated with a large amount of silt. This silt was a constant cause of problems in the man made irrigation systems.

What kind of food did the Mesopotamians eat?

Why was irrigation so important in ancient Mesopotamia?
-------------------------------------------------------

Irrigation in Mesopotamia Even though the farmland of Sumer was so fertile, crops planted there still needed water, and rainfall in the area, even during ancient times, would have been very scarce. As a result, Mesopotamians developed a system of irrigation. In fact, the Mesopotamians became masters at controlling water.

What was the seed plough in ancient Mesopotamia?
------------------------------------------------

It is a beam-ard, a simple machine which scratches a furrow without turning the soil and this changed little in design throughout the whole of Mesopotamian history. They were pulled by oxen. Seed ploughs, with a funnel through which seed was dropped into the furrow, are depicted on seals from at least 2300 B.C. onwards.
