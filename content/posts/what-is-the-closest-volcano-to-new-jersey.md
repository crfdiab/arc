What is the closest volcano to New Jersey?
------------------------------------------

Rutan Hill  
Tucked near the New York border in the rural township of Wantage is Rutan Hill, a rather unremarkable hump that is about as close to a volcano as you’ll find in New Jersey.

Did New Jersey ever have a volcano?
-----------------------------------

Do not fret: New Jersey did not have an extremely deadly volcano. However, approximately 420 million years ago, New Jersey did have its own volcanic activity, though. A volcanic vent was discovered in Sussex County more than a century ago — it is known as Rutan Hill, or the Beemerville Volcano.

Is there a volcano in NYC?
--------------------------

No. The geologic forces that generated volcanoes in the eastern United States millions of years ago no longer exist. Through plate tectonics, the eastern U.S. has been isolated from the global tectonic features (tectonic plate boundaries and hot spots in the mantle), that cause volcanic activity.

Are there any extinct volcanoes in NJ?
--------------------------------------

An ancient volcano turned prime real estate. Rutan Hill in Sussex county is what remains of the only volcanic site in New Jersey. The Beemerville volcano, reportedly active around 440 million years ago, has since collapsed, forming a caldera (a volcanic crater) on the mouth of the once-lava -spewing hill.

How many volcanoes are there in the United States?
--------------------------------------------------

In the United States, volcanoes in the Cascade Range and Alaska (Aleutian volcanic chain) are part of the Ring, while Hawaiian volcanoes form over a ‘hot spot’ near the center of the Ring. There are 169 potentially active volcanoes in the United States.

Where was the first eruption in New Jersey?
-------------------------------------------

Blackburn and his colleagues showed that the eruption in Morocco was the earliest, with ones in Nova Scotia and New Jersey coming about 3,000 and 13,000 years later, respectively. Sediments below that time contain pollen, spores and other fossils characteristic of the Triassic era; in those above, the fossils disappear.
