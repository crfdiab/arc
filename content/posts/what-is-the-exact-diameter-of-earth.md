What is the exact diameter of Earth?
------------------------------------

about 12,756 kilometers  
Its diameter (the distance from one side to the other through Earth’s center) is 7,926 miles (about 12,756 kilometers). Earth is slightly smaller when measured between the North and South Poles which gives a diameter of 7,907 miles (12,725 kilometers).

How many feet around is the Earth?
----------------------------------

131,477,280 feet  
The circumference of the Earth is 131,477,280 feet around; or 24,901 miles.

How many feet is the equator?
-----------------------------

The circumference measured at the equator is 24,901 miles, so a minute of longitude at the equator is slightly larger than a minute of latitude — specifically it is 6086 feet.

What is Earth’s volume?
-----------------------

The Earth has a volume of about 1,083,206,916,846 cubic kilometers (259,875,159,532 cubic miles).

What is the size and shape of the earth?
----------------------------------------

It is an oblate spheroid. It’s flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. The Earth is 12,756km at the equator and 12,714km from pole to pole. We round this up to 13,000km.

What does the earth weigh?
--------------------------

5.972 × 10^24 kg  
Earth/Mass

How big is the Earth in feet and in?
------------------------------------

There are a multitude of ways to answer this question. Circumference: A quick Google search will tell you Earth is 24,901 miles around. In feet that would be 24,901 \* 5,280 = 131,477,280 feet. Radius: Another search will see the radius as 3,959 miles. So to get feet 3,959 \* 5280 = 20,903,520 feet.

How big is Earth in miles and km?
---------------------------------

73 x 10 11 cubic miles (1.083 x 10 12 km 3) Radius: 3,959 miles (6,371 km) Diameter: 7,918 miles (12,742 km) Surface Area: 1.97 x10 8 square miles (5.1 x 10 8 km 2) Mass: 5.972 x 10 24 kg

What is the radius and circumference of the Earth?
--------------------------------------------------

Radius, diameter and circumference. The radius of Earth at the equator is 3,963 miles (6,378 kilometers), according to NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. However, Earth is not quite a sphere. The planet’s rotation causes it to bulge at the equator.

How big is the Earth from the equator to the Poles?
---------------------------------------------------

The circumference of Earth at the equator is about 24,874 miles (40,030 km), but from pole-to-pole — the meridional circumference — Earth is only 24,860 miles (40,008 km) around. This shape, caused by the flattening at the poles, is called an oblate spheroid.
