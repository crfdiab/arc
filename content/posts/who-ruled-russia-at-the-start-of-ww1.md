Who ruled Russia at the start of ww1?
-------------------------------------

Tsar Nicholas II  
In 1913, Tsar Nicholas II celebrated the tercentenary of Romanov rule in Russia. He and his dynasty ruled over a huge empire, stretching from central Europe to the Pacific Ocean and from the Arctic to the borders of Afghanistan.

What was the effect of WW1 on Russia?
-------------------------------------

The effects of World War I gave rise to the Russian Revolution. In February and March 1917, a popular revolution forced the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the rise of a provisional government. This government, which kept Russia in the war, was itself overthrown by radical socialists just eight months later.

When did Russia get involved in World War 1?
--------------------------------------------

Tsar Nicholas II mobilised Russian forces on 30 July 1914 to threaten Austria if it invaded Serbia. Christopher Clark states: “The Russian general mobilisation \[of 30 July\] was one of the most momentous decisions of the July crisis.” This was the first of the general mobilisations.

How many Russian soldiers were killed in World War 1?
-----------------------------------------------------

In 1916 two million Russian soldiers were killed or seriously wounded and a third of a million were taken prisoner. Millions of peasants were conscripted into the Tsar’s armies but supplies of rifles and ammunition remained inadequate. It is estimated that one third of Russia’s able-bodied men were serving in the army.

Who was the Russian general in the First World War?
---------------------------------------------------

(9) On the outbreak of the First World War General Alexander Samsonov was given command of the Russian Second Army for the invasion of East Prussia. He advanced slowly into the south western corner of the province with the intention of linking up with General Paul von Rennenkampf advancing from the north east.

What was the result of the Russian Revolution in 1917?
------------------------------------------------------

The result was revolution, civil war and famine in 1917–20, followed by decades of Communist rule. A new book, Towards the Flame. Empire, War and the End of Tsarist Russia, by research fellow Dominic Lieven explains why Russia’s rulers allowed their country to be pulled into the First World War.
