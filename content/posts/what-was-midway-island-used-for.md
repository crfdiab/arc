What was Midway Island used for?
--------------------------------

In 1903, Midway became the final link in a global telegraph system, inaugurated by a message from President Theodore Roosevelt. In the late 1930s, the atoll became a landing site for Pan Am Clippers crossing the Pacific Ocean. From 1941 until 1993, it housed a military base.

What formed Midway Island?
--------------------------

Atolls form as oceanic volcanoes erupt and grow above the water line, then erode to sea level. In the case of Midway, that process began 28 million years ago, making it the second oldest of the Hawaiian chain. Underwater coral reefs ring the eroding mountain, which can leave a few islands behind as high ground.

Does the US still have a base on Midway?
----------------------------------------

In 1988, Midway Atoll became an “overlay” national wildlife refuge, still subject to primary jurisdiction of the Navy. In 1993, Naval Air Facility operations shutdown completely.

Who controls Midway Island today?
---------------------------------

United States Department of the Interior  
On October 31, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13022, which transferred the jurisdiction and control of the atoll to the United States Department of the Interior. The FWS assumed management of the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge.

Who owns Midway Island now?
---------------------------

Midway Islands, unincorporated territory of the United States in the central Pacific Ocean, 1,300 miles (2,100 km) northwest of Honolulu.

Is Wake Island still a military base?
-------------------------------------

Today, the island serves as a trans-Pacific refueling stop for military aircraft and supports Missile Defense Agency test activities. Wake is currently managed by the Pacific Air Force Support Center located at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Anchorage, Alaska, and falls under 11th Air Force.

Can a person visit Midway Island?
---------------------------------

Entry into the Midway Islands is heavily restricted and requires a special-use permit to visit, often from the U.S. Military or the US Fish and Wildlife Services. And they both generally only give permits to scientists and educators. This even applies to U.S. and American Samoan citizens.

When did the US occupy the Midway Islands?
------------------------------------------

Today in 1867, the United States occupied the Midway Islands in the Pacific Ocean. This atoll, less than 2.4 miles in area, was one of the most strategically important spots in the world for the better part of a century.

Why did the US take control of Midway Atoll?
--------------------------------------------

Also in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt granted the US Navy complete control of the islands. The Navy soon opened a radio station there and sent a squad of Marines to keep Japanese poachers from hunting the islands’ birds to extinction. The golden age of flight once again changed Midway’s mission.
