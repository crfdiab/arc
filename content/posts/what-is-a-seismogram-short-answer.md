What is a seismogram short answer?
----------------------------------

A seismogram is a record written by a seismograph in response to ground motions produced by an earthquake, explosion, or other ground-motion sources.

How do you define seismograph?
------------------------------

Seismographs are instruments used to record the motion of the ground during an earthquake. They are installed in the ground throughout the world and operated as part of a seismographic network.

What is seismograph explain with example?
-----------------------------------------

The definition of a seismograph is a measuring instrument for earthquakes that tracks duration and magnitude. A device used to measure the duration and magnitude of a San Francisco earthquake is an example of a seismograph. An instrument that records the intensity and duration of earthquakes and similar tremors.

How does a seismometer work?
----------------------------

An instrument sensitive to tiny movements in the ground. A seismometer is a device that is sensitive to vibrations. It works on the principle of a pendulum: a heavy, inert mass with a certain resistance to movement (i.e. inertia) due to its weight is suspended from a frame by a spring that allows movement.

How is a seismograph used today?
--------------------------------

A modern seismograph can help scientists detect earthquakes and measure several aspects of the event: The time at which the earthquake occurred. The epicenter, which is the location on the surface of the earth below which the earthquake occurred. The amount of energy released by the earthquake.

Which is the best description of a seismogram?
----------------------------------------------

A detail of the seismogram. A seismogram is a graph output by a seismograph. It is a record of the ground motion at a measuring station as a function of time. Seismograms typically record motions in three cartesian axes (x, y, and z), with the z axis perpendicular to the Earthâ€™s surface and the x- and y- axes parallel to the surface.

How long does it take to read a seismogram?
-------------------------------------------

Seismograms are read from left to right. Time marks show when the earthquake occurred. Time is shown by half-hour (thirty minute) units. Each rotation of the seismograph drum is thirty minutes.

How are seismograms transmitted to the USGS?
--------------------------------------------

Since the electrical signals from the seismometers are typically transmitted to the USGS by microwave or over telephone wires, electrical and radio noise on the transmission path may also show up on the seismogram.

Where are the seismograms located in Northern California?
---------------------------------------------------------

The seismograms displayed are from a few of the seismograph stations routinely recorded by the Northern California Seismograph Network. Each is a record of how the ground moved at a particular seismograph station in Northern California during a 24-hour period.
