What are the differences between mixed diurnal and semidiurnal tides?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

An area has a diurnal tidal cycle if it experiences one high and one low tide every lunar day. An area has a mixed semidiurnal tidal cycle if it experiences two high and two low tides of different size every lunar day. Many areas on the western coast of North America experience these tidal cycles.

What are the three types of tide classification?
------------------------------------------------

There are three different types of tides: semi-diurnal, diurnal, and mixed.

How do you classify tides?
--------------------------

TIDESTYPES OF TIDES: HIGH TIDE AND LOW TIDE; SPRING TIDES AND NEAP TIDES

1. High tide: when the sea water reaches its greatest height within the tide cycle. They are shown in blue on the tide tables.
2. Low tide: when the sea water reaches its lowest height within the tide cycle. They are shown in red on the tide tables.

What is a very low tide called?
-------------------------------

Neap tides, which also occur twice a month, happen when the sun and moon are at right angles to each other. This means that high tides are a little higher and low tides are a little lower than average. These are called spring tides, a common historical term that has nothing to do with the season of spring.

Why are there two different types of tides?
-------------------------------------------

The tides are very sensitive to the full moon, and the conection among the sun and the moon makes the tide grow faster. There are two different types of tides: high tide and low tide. This type of tide occurs when the ocean is at its higher peak. If the coast has some sand, in the high tide period, part of the sand will be under water.

Which is the correct classification for a diurnal tide?
-------------------------------------------------------

There are three primary classifications for tides, depending on the number and relative heights of tidal cycles per day. consists of only one high tide and one low tide per day (Figure 11.3.1). “Diurnal” refers to a daily occurrence, so a situation where there is only one complete tidal cycle per day is considered a diurnal tide.

Where does the moon’s high tide and low tide occur?
---------------------------------------------------

The Moon’s high tide occurs in the same place as the Sun’s low tide and the Moon’s low tide in the same place as the Sun’s high tide. At neap tides, the tidal range relatively small. Neap tides occur when the Earth, the Sun, and the Moon form a right angle; the Moon is in its first or third quarter.

How many high and low tides are there in a day?
-----------------------------------------------

Three basic tidal patterns occur along the Earth’s major shorelines. In general, most areas have two high tides and two low tides each day.
