What is on the other side of the Arctic ocean?
----------------------------------------------

The Antarctic is almost a geographic opposite of the Arctic, because Antarctica is a land mass surrounded by an ocean. The open ocean allows the forming sea ice to move more freely, resulting in higher drift speeds. However, Antarctic sea ice forms ridges much less often than sea ice in the Arctic.

Why is the Arctic not on Google Maps?

Where are the oceans and seas of Alaska?

Oceans and Seas of Alaska. This is also the official division between the Pacific and Arctic coasts. The Bering Strait, a narrow stretch of water separating Alaska from the mainland of Russia by a mere 53 miles, also marks the limit between the Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea, which follows the Alaskan coast around and into the Arctic Ocean.

What is the name of the strait that separates Alaska from Russia?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Bering Strait, a narrow stretch of water separating Alaska from the mainland of Russia by a mere 53 miles, also marks the limit between the Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea, which follows the Alaskan coast around and into the Arctic Ocean. Alaskan towns along the Arctic Ocean are few and far between.
