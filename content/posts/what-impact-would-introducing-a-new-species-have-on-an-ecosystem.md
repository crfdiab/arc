What impact would introducing a new species have on an ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When a new and aggressive species is introduced into an ecosystem, it may not have any natural predators or controls. It can breed and spread quickly, taking over an area. Native wildlife may not have evolved defenses against the invader, or they may not be able to compete with a species that has no predators.

How do introduced species become established in a new ecosystem?
----------------------------------------------------------------

introduced to a habitat similar to their own introduced to a habitat different than their own outcompete native species generally have no native predators generally have native predators often have high reproductive rates often have low reproductive rates can tolerate a range of conditions.

Why a nonnative species would thrive better in an ecosystem than a native species?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A nonnative species would thrive better than a native species if they learn to adapt and proliferate quickly. Explanation: If such a case occurs in the ecosystem this results in competition between both the native and nonnative species whoever is more efficient will wipe out the other species.

Why is it better to have more species in an ecosystem?
------------------------------------------------------

Increasing species diversity can influence ecosystem functions — such as productivity — by increasing the likelihood that species will use complementary resources and can also increase the likelihood that a particularly productive or efficient species is present in the community.

What factors affect ecosystems?
-------------------------------

They include factors such as light, radiation, temperature, water, chemicals, gases, wind and soil. In some environments, such as marine environments, pressure and sound can be important abiotic components.

What impacts can an invasive animal species have?
-------------------------------------------------

In their new ecosystems, invasive alien species become predators, competitors, parasites, hybridizers, and diseases of our native and domesticated plants and animals. In addition, they are usually able to reproduce and spread quickly, often out-competing native plant and animal species for food water and space.

How do invasive species affect me?
----------------------------------

Invasive species can negatively impact human health by infecting humans with new diseases, serving as vectors for existing diseases, or causing wounds through bites, stings, allergens, or other toxins (Mazza et al. 2013).

Why are invasive species bad?
-----------------------------

Invasive species are harmful to our natural resources (fish, wildlife, plants and overall ecosystem health) because they disrupt natural communities and ecological processes. The invasive species can outcompete the native species for food and habitats and sometimes even cause their extinction.

Why are native species important?
---------------------------------

A native species is a plant or animal that has always been a part of a particular environment. Native species conservation is important because many native species populations are declining due to degraded habitat and the spread of aquatic nuisance species.

How does introducing a new species affect an ecosystem?
-------------------------------------------------------

Typically, invasive species harm an ecosystem. For example, the Burmese python is found in the US but it isn’t supposed to be here. These snakes were likely released by humans and were pets at one time. The environment is suitable for them and they have adapted to the area. Introducing a new species can also introduce any diseases that species has.

Why are invasive species able to adapt to a new niche?
------------------------------------------------------

Are the species able to adapt to a new niche better than the species that are native to that location? According to the enemy release hypothesis, exotic plants are able to thrive in a new location because their native predators are absent, which allows them to thrive over the native species.

Why are exotic plants able to thrive in a new location?
-------------------------------------------------------

According to the enemy release hypothesis, exotic plants are able to thrive in a new location because their native predators are absent, which allows them to thrive over the native species.

How are snakes adapted to their new environment?
------------------------------------------------

These snakes were likely released by humans and were pets at one time. The environment is suitable for them and they have adapted to the area. Introducing a new species can also introduce any diseases that species has. These new diseases can spread to other native species and negatively affect them.
