What causes a tractor bucket to come down on its own?
-----------------------------------------------------

99.99% of the time this is caused by your cylinders leaking internally. Inside the cylinder are two oil seals facing away from each other, or, just one rod seal. If just one leaks oil past, oil will flow thru the lines to the other cylinder and cause your dropping.

Why won’t my 3 point hitch won’t lift?
--------------------------------------

When a tractor 3 point hitch doesn’t operate properly, many times low fluid, a clogged hydraulic filter, or low or contaminated hydraulic fluid is the cause of the problem. If the loader does not operate correctly, then there is a problem is likey related to the hydraulic pump.

What is a loader valve?
-----------------------

Hydraulic control valve for tractor loader is one of the most fundamental parts in hydraulic machinery. It allows fluid flow into different paths from one or more sources. Hydraulic control valve for tractor loader usually consist of a spool inside a cylinder which can be mechanically or electrically controlled.

How do you lift a bucket on a tractor?
--------------------------------------

Slide the chain under the bucket and hook it high on the front axle. Tie off the hydraulic lever then pull ahead with the tow vehicle until the chain is tight. This will lift the bucket high enough for you to tow it.

How can you tell if a hydraulic valve is bad?
---------------------------------------------

Many of the failures in a hydraulic system show similar symptoms: a gradual or sudden loss of high pressure, resulting in loss of power or loss of speed in the cylinders. The cylinder(s) may not move at all, or if they do they may move too slowly or may stall under light loads.

How do I know if my hydraulic valve is bad?
-------------------------------------------

Here are 3 signs of pressure relief valve failure to watch out for when you’re troubleshooting your facility’s system:

1. System Cannot Reach Pressure.
2. System is Over Maximum Pressure.
3. Pressure Relief Valve is Leaking or Has No Pressure.

Does a 3 point hitch have down pressure?
----------------------------------------

A lot of folks ask about down pressure on the 3 point, but only one manufacturer that comes to mind (Belarus) ever did it. There must be a down side, or tractor makers would include it. As stated, the only option is to add weight. FYI several manufacturers have had tractors with down pressure.

How do you increase hydraulic pressure?
---------------------------------------

there is one way to increase pressure in system there is pressure relief valve in the gear pump or hydraulic pump which is operated on set pressure. when power consumption reduced pipe pressure gets increased and this valve get actuated to recirculate the fluid into the gear pump.

How does a loader valve work?
-----------------------------

A direct-acting, load-holding valve allows the load pressure to work against the full area of the poppet. As the operator lowers the load and directs flow to the bore end of the cylinder, pressure will be applied to the load control valve through the pilot line.

Can you add a bucket to any tractor?
------------------------------------

You can attach a loader to any tractor because the majority of loaders are compatible with all types of tractors. On the front of your tractor, you can mount a variety of other useful attachments. They enhance its capabilities while making farm chores simpler, quicker, and maybe even enjoyable!

What are the most common causes of hydraulic system failure?
------------------------------------------------------------

Air and Water Contamination Air and water contamination are the leading causes of hydraulic failure, accounting for 80 to 90% of hydraulic failures. Faulty pumps, system breaches or temperature issues often cause both types of contamination.

What’s the hydraulic problem on my Kubota Tractor?
--------------------------------------------------

With the bucket up high I clipped a small tree in reverse. Hydraulics to front bucket will not lift. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Unfortunately I reversed it into the shed. Now I cannot remove the Backhoe in order to check the inlet valve on rear of tractor. Have checked hydraulic lines to the bucket.

What kind of loader do I need for Kubota bucket?
------------------------------------------------

Kubota bx1800 with la211 loader. removed loader, replaced Kubota bx1800 with la211 loader. removed loader, replaced 4 hoses (raise and lower boom, dump and curl bucket) reattached bucket, I marked all of the hoses and their attachment points. The bucket rais…

Is there a problem with the Kubota 3 pt pump?
---------------------------------------------

Replaced Pump ( that cured bypass problem ) 3 PT still OK but bucket slow to lift light load. Checked Relief cartridge in Control but that’s as far as I’ve gotten…….
