Is light reflected by the moon?
-------------------------------

The moon shines because its surface reflects light from the sun. And despite the fact that it sometimes seems to shine very brightly, the moon reflects only between 3 and 12 percent of the sunlight that hits it. The perceived brightness of the moon from Earth depends on where the moon is in its orbit around the planet.

What happens when the light reflected by the Earth is falling on the moon?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moonlight illuminates a lake and surroundings. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon is colored red by indirect sunlight, which Earth’s atmosphere has scattered and refracted. Earthlight (indirect sunlight reflected from Earth) illuminates the dim side of the Moon, while direct sunlight the bright side.

Why does the Moon reflect the light of the Sun?
-----------------------------------------------

Solar eclipses occur only at a new moon, when the moon passes between the earth and the sun: the moon is entirely backlit and so it’s visible only as a silhouette. (You can actually see it a very little bit due to “earthshine”, the light reflected by the earth, onto the moon, and then back.)

Can you see the reflection of the Earth on the Moon?
----------------------------------------------------

This light is only visible when there is little sunlightreflecting directly off the moon, which would otherwise drown out the muchdimmer earthshine. Thus, Earth’s reflection is only visible to the naked eye onthe darker portion of thin crescentmoons, and not full moons. RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU… Created with Sketch.

Why does the Moon not glow like the Earth?
------------------------------------------

The moon is made out of rock; it’s actually made of pretty much the same composition as the earth. As such, it can’t glow, for the same reason the earth doesn’t. It reflects light from the sun.

Why is the Moon always half lit in the sky?
-------------------------------------------

The Moon is always half-lit. The side of the Moon facing the Sun appears bright because of reflected sunlight, and the side of the Moon facing away from the Sun is dark. Our perspective on the half-lit Moon changes as the Moon orbits Earth.
