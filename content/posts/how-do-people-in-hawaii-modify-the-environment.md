How do people in Hawaii modify the environment?
-----------------------------------------------

When people settled in Hawaii, they brought animals and pests with them and huge numbers of native flora and fauna were wiped out because of new onslaught of new predators. For example, newly arrived yellow jackets lowered native insect populations, resulting in less food for local birds.

How is the earth changing in Hawaii?
------------------------------------

Hawaii’s climate is changing. In the last 50 years, sea level has risen along Hawaii’s shores, increasing erosion and threatening coastal communities and infrastructure. Climate is changing because the earth is warming. People have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the air by 40 percent since the late 1700s.

What is the natural environment in Hawaii?
------------------------------------------

Since Hawaii is located in the tropics, its climate is mild and summer highs are usually in the upper 80s (31˚C) and winters are in the low 80s (28˚C). There are also wet and dry seasons on the islands and the local climate on each island varies based on one’s position in relation to the mountain ranges.

What was the environment like before Hawaii became a state?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prior to that it was the Territory of Hawaii (1898 to 1959) and originally the Kingdom of Hawaii . The majority of the environmental issues affecting Hawaii today are related to pressures from increasing human and animal population in the limited separation space of the islands. ^ “Environmental Center at University of Hawaii Manoa”.

How does tourism affect the environment in Hawaii?
--------------------------------------------------

Since about eight million people visit Hawaii every year, tourism is a big deal. People affect the environment more than anyone else in both positive and negative ways. One positive way that people impact the environment is that people are able to realize that things have to be protected or we will lose things that are precious.

How did humans change the landscape of Hawaii?
----------------------------------------------

Humans also dramatically and directly changed the landscape. Not only did humans bring non-native plants and animals, but they also changed the landscape of Hawaii by clearing forests for tourist developments and homes. Scientists think we probably don’t even know most of the species that have gone extinct.

How do people affect the environment in a positive way?
-------------------------------------------------------

People affect the environment more than anyone else in both positive and negative ways. One positive way that people impact the environment is that people are able to realize that things have to be protected or we will lose things that are precious. We have learned to recycle and to no pollute our rivers and waters.
