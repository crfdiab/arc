How did Mesopotamian use their environment to make building materials?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

How did Mesopotamia use their environment to make building materials? Mesopotamians traded grain for goods they needed such as stone and wood. Why did many Sumerian city-states develop near the mouth of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers? Because the land near the rivers was fertile.

What building materials did the Mesopotamians use?
--------------------------------------------------

The materials used to build a Mesopotamian house were similar but not exact as those used today: mud brick, mud plaster and wooden doors, which were all naturally available around the city, although wood was not common in some cities of Sumer.

What were the three environmental challenges of Mesopotamia?
------------------------------------------------------------

What was the most common building material in ancient Mesopotamia?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Stone, clay and glass were used to make vases, and vases of hard stone have been dug up at Girsu similar to those of the early dynastic period of Egypt.

How is Mesopotamian art related to the environment?
---------------------------------------------------

An equally apparent, if more abstract, association between Mesopotamian art and environment can be detected when the intellectual climate engendered by the latter is understood.

What was the profession of Architecture in Mesopotamia?

What did the ancient Mesopotamians do for a living?
