What forms when rain falls through a layer of freezing air?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Sleet Forms in Layers of Air (Warm above Cold) During precipitation formation, if temperatures are at or below freezing, 0°C (32°F), at cloud level, water in the air freezes into ice crystals, and the crystals stick together to make snow.

What is it called when rain freezes as it falls?
------------------------------------------------

noun. rain that freezes as it falls to Earth. Also called ice pellets.

Which of the following types of precipitation would fall if snow falls through a thick layer of warm air?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sleet  
Four types of winter precipitation Precipitation starts as snow in the cold layer at the top, then melts to rain as it falls through the warm layer, then refreezes into sleet or freezing rain as it falls through the cold layer near the surface. For sleet to occur, the warm air layer is rather thin.

What’s the difference between freezing rain and sleet?
------------------------------------------------------

Freezing rain occurs when the layer of freezing air is so thin that the raindrops do not have enough time to freeze before reaching the ground. Sleet is simply frozen raindrops and occurs when the layer of freezing air along the surface is thicker. This causes the raindrops to freeze before reaching the ground.

How much freezing rain is dangerous?
------------------------------------

A tenth of an inch of freezing rain becomes a nuisance. It’s not enough for power outages, but it can cause sidewalks and overpasses/bridges to turn slick. A half an inch of ice damages trees. Widespread power outages become more likely.

Which is the most common type of precipitation?
-----------------------------------------------

rain  
The most common types of precipitation are rain, hail, and snow. Rain is precipitation that falls to the surface of the Earth as water droplets.

What is worse freezing rain or sleet?
-------------------------------------

“Freezing rain is by far the most dangerous because it forms a solid sheet of ice, as opposed to sleet that just has small ice pellets that quickly bounce off of the surface,” AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson said.

How is freezing rain different from other types of precipitation?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 Accumulating freezing rain is a major cause of ice storms. Joanna Cepuchowicz/EyeEm/Getty Images. Freezing rain forms similarly to sleet, except that the layer of warm air at mid-levels is deeper. Precipitation starts out as either snow or supercooled raindrops, but it all becomes rain in the warm layer.

How does freezing rain, sleet and snow form?
--------------------------------------------

Freezing rain occurs when snow travels through a large layer of warm air and melts into rain. It then hits a very thin layer of freezing cold air at the surface.

What kind of precipitation falls from the clouds?
-------------------------------------------------

Snow is precipitation in the form of flakes or virga of ice water falling from the clouds. It is normally seen together with thin, weak, and high cirrus clouds. It can at times fall when the atmospheric temperatures are above freezing, but snow mostly occurs in sub-freezing air.

Why is freezing rain called supercooled rain?
---------------------------------------------

This is why it is called freezing rain. How does the droplet become supercooled? We all know that water freezes at 0 °C but in the same way that raindrops need a nucleus (microscopic particles of dust or dirt) to form around, water droplets can only freeze around an ice nucleus.
