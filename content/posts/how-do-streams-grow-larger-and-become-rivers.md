How do streams grow larger and become rivers?
---------------------------------------------

When one stream meets another and they merge together, the smaller stream is known as a tributary. The two streams meet at a confluence. It takes many tributary streams to form a river. A river grows larger as it collects water from more tributaries.

What do you call a stream flowing into a large river?
-----------------------------------------------------

A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A confluence, where two or more bodies of water meet together, usually refers to the joining of tributaries.

Is a river a large stream?
--------------------------

A river is a large stream of water flowing through the land, usually fed by smaller streams.

How wide is a stream?
---------------------

What is a Stream? A stream is slightly larger than a branch and can still often be called a creek by folks. Technically, if it is less than 60 feet wide, it can be called a stream.

What is a large natural stream of water called?
-----------------------------------------------

A river is a large, natural stream of flowing water. Rivers are found on every continent and on nearly every kind of land.

Is a creek or a stream bigger?
------------------------------

Streams vary in size from streamlets to brooks, creeks, and rivers. However, a stream is generally considered to be smaller than a river. A creek is a small body of flowing water. Since stream refers to any flowing body of water, a creek is a type of stream.

Which is larger a river or a stream?
------------------------------------

The point where a stream or river empties into a lake, a larger river, or an ocean, is its mouth. When one stream or river flows into another, usually larger, stream or river, and adds its flow, it is considered a tributary of the larger river. Many tributaries make up a river system.

How are streams formed and how are rivers formed?
-------------------------------------------------

Small streams meet and join together, growing larger and larger until the flow can be called a river. On its way down, the water shapes the landscape by wearing away rock and carving out a network of valleys.

How does a river form on its way down?
--------------------------------------

Small streams meet and join together, growing larger and larger until the flow can be called a river. On its way down, the water shapes the landscape by wearing away rock and carving out a network of valleys. Reaching lower ground, the river widens and takes a winding route.

How are streams and rivers driven by gravity?
---------------------------------------------

A stream is flow of water, driven by gravity, in a natural channel, on land. A small brook in a meadow and the Amazon River are both streams. It is interesting to watch water on a recently bulldozed construction site with a slope. At first the water saturates the ground and begins to flow downhill across the surface of the slope in a thin sheet.
