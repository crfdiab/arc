How quickly does a Norway spruce grow?
--------------------------------------

We love this tree!! 15 year old Norway Spruce 35 ft tall. The Norway Spruce is a fast growing (2-3′ per year) evergreen that has dark green needles that are 1 inch long, and can grow up to 5 ft a year in a good weather year. It never drops its needles but keeps them on for up to 10 years.

What does a mature Norway spruce look like?
-------------------------------------------

Norway Spruce Tree Info The trees bear stiff evergreen needles up to an inch (2.5 cm.) long, colored a shiny forest green. The bark is a red-brown and furrowed. The seed cones are large and can grow 6 inches (15 cm.)

How do you keep a Norway spruce small?
--------------------------------------

If you just want to shape your dwarf spruce, or if your tree is young and you want to trim it to keep it small, then you can prune with a good amount of success. Taking care not to cut into the dead zone, cut back any branches that extend beyond the tree’s conical shape. Remove ½ to 1 inch (up to 2.5 cm.)

Do Norway spruce need full sun?
-------------------------------

Light. Norway spruce need a place in full sun to partial shade. Look for a position that receives at least six hours of sun per day. They do not tolerate full shade.

Can you overwater a Norway Spruce?
----------------------------------

Spruce trees do not like being waterlogged. When a spruce tree is transplanted, its roots go into shock, which limits their ability to absorb water. Overwatering can kill the tree, so checking the soil moisture before watering is critical.

Can you over water Norway Spruce?
---------------------------------

Watering spruce trees is tricky. Over watering causes branches to turn brown, starting at the bottom. If the soil is heavy, such as clay, ensure that trees do not stand in water. If the roots are choked of oxygen, fungal disease attacks the tree, or it creates a shallow root system, allowing the tree to easily topple.

Can you cut back a Norway spruce?
---------------------------------

Norway spruce is considered a relatively shade-tolerant species, and its branches are long lived, with moderate-to-low self-pruning ability (e.g. Nicolescu, 1999).

Should you trim a Norway spruce?
--------------------------------

Prune Norway spruce in the late winter or early spring. For young trees, follow branch tips back until you find two branches growing to either side. Doing this will encourage the side branches that remain to grow faster and make the tree bushier. Cut the lowest rung of branches on the tree to force more height.

What does an overwatered spruce tree look like?
-----------------------------------------------

Look at the lowest limbs of the spruce tree to see if they are brown or yellow in color. Overwatered spruce trees begin to die from the bottom up.

How big are the flowers on a Norway spruce tree?
------------------------------------------------

Norway spruce trees have tiny, pink flowers clustered on their branches. What’s more noticeable, though, is the tree’s cones. They start off purple, then turn brown in fall. The cones have scales, and they’re about 4-6 inches long, which is the largest cone size among spruce trees in t he US.

Can a Norway spruce tree be an invasive tree?
