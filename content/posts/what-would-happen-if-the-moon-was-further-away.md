What would happen if the Moon was further away?
-----------------------------------------------

There is a physical principle called the conservation of momentum, which says that the Earth will have to slow down as the moon gets farther away. This means that the length of the day increases slightly – more hours in a day is probably all you wanted! The moon will never go away though.

How would the Moon look if it was closer?
-----------------------------------------

For one, the moon would be more than half of the sky, which is much bigger than the Sun, obviously. If the moon was closer, then the centre of the Moon would also be closer, and so the gravitational pull of the moon would be roughly 1/10th of the pull of the Earth.

What does it mean when the Moon is getting closer?
--------------------------------------------------

A supermoon happens when the full moon coincides with the moon’s closest approach to Earth in its orbit. Supermoons make the moon appear a little brighter and closer than normal, although the difference is hard to spot with the naked eye.

Does the Moon get closer to us?
-------------------------------

The Moon will swing ever closer to Earth until it reaches a point 11,470 miles (18,470 kilometers) above our planet, a point termed the Roche limit. “Reaching the Roche limit means that the gravity holding it \[the Moon\] together is weaker than the tidal forces acting to pull it apart,” Willson said.

What happens when the Moon is closer to the Earth?
--------------------------------------------------

The difference between low tide and high tide would be higher, and large tidal waves, depending on the distance of the Moon, would probably cause devastating floods. Finally, if the Moon was closer to the Earth, the gravitational pull would not only affect the waters of our planet, but it could also cause severe earthquakes and volcanic eruptions .

Which is bigger the earth or the Moon?
--------------------------------------

And it would be even worse for the Moon. The Earth is more than 80 times more massive than the Moon, and so the tides the Moon feels would be even bigger. In fact, at that distance the Moon would be well inside the Earth’s Roche limit, the distance from the Earth where its tides could break another object apart.

How close is the center of the Moon to Earth?
---------------------------------------------

The center of the Moon would then be an extra 1,738 kilometers away (the distance of the Moon’s surface to its center, in other words its radius). So now the center of the Moon is 2,158 kilometers (1,340 miles) away, which is close . If you redo the gravity calculation, you’d find the force of gravity from the Moon on you is 1/10 th that of Earth!

How many miles is the Moon from the Earth?
------------------------------------------

In the video, the Moon is 420 kilometers (260 miles) from the Earth—in this case, that’s measured from the surface of the Earth to the surface of the Moon. The center of the Moon would then be an extra 1,738 kilometers away (the distance of the Moon’s surface to its center, in other words its radius).
