Why did Europeans explore North Carolina?
-----------------------------------------

Their initial motivation was primarily economic: after the “discovery” of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492, several navigators followed in his wake searching for the riches of the Orient.

What did the early explorers find in NC?
----------------------------------------

Europeans Arrive The first Europeans to arrive in North Carolina were the Spanish. First, explorer Giovanni da Verrazano mapped out the coastline in 1524. Later explorers included Juan Pardo, who founded Fort San Juan in western North Carolina in 1567, and Hernando de Soto, who came searching for gold.

Why did the Spanish eventually give up exploring North Carolina?
----------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
