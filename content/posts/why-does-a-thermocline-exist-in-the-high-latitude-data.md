Why does a thermocline exist in the high latitude data?
-------------------------------------------------------

What is a thermocline? Why do thermoclines NOT exist in areas of high latitude? Because there is no rapid change in temperature with depth.

Why is there no thermocline in the ocean at high latitudes?
-----------------------------------------------------------

There is no thermocline present in high-latitude ocean waters because surface waters are cooler. The temperature is similar to that of deeper waters, so there is no rapid change in temperature. The pelagic zone i the open ocean of any depth.

Why do we usually only see thermocline and pycnocline in low latitude oceans?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

At low latitudes, density increases with depth (pycnocline) while high latitudes keep a high density throughout the depth (isopycnal). At high-latitudes, high-density (cold) water is present at the surface.

Why does water at higher latitudes sink in the ocean?
-----------------------------------------------------

Because the surface water is now less dense than the cooler water below, the warmest waters remain near the surface. The surface waters cool, condense, become more dense and ultimately sink. Because the cooling can be very intense at high latitudes, the surface water can cool enough to sink to the bottom.

How much of the ocean is deep zone?
-----------------------------------

There is a pronounced difference in temperature and salinity between the surface and deep zones of the Pacific. The deep zone, which contains about 80 percent of the ocean’s volume, has relatively stable temperature and salinity patterns; its average temperature is 38.3 °F (3.5 °C).

What does the thermocline mean in the ocean?
--------------------------------------------

A thermocline is the transition layer between warmer mixed water at the ocean’s surface and cooler deep water below. For example, hurricane forecasters must consider not just the temperature of the ocean’s skin (the sea surface temperature), but also the depth of warm water above the thermocline.

How does temperature change with depth in the thermocline?
----------------------------------------------------------

A thermocline is a layer in the ocean in which the temperature changes with depth. In the deep oceans, the temperature decreases sharply with depth for 1000 m or so beneath the surface, as illustrated in Fig. 1.3.

Is the thermocline permanent in the tropics?
--------------------------------------------

A thermocline is the transition layer between warmer mixed water at the ocean’s surface and cooler deep water below. In the ocean, the depth and strength of the thermocline vary from season to season and year to year. It is semi-permanent in the tropics, variable in temperate regions (often deepest during the summer),…

How does the thermocline affect a hurricane forecast?
-----------------------------------------------------

Thermoclines also play a role in meteorological forecasting. For example, hurricane forecasters must consider not just the temperature of the ocean’s skin (the sea surface temperature), but also the depth of warm water above the thermocline. Water vapor evaporated from the ocean is a hurricane’s primary fuel.
