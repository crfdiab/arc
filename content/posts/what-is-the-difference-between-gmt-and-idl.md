What is the difference between GMT and IDL?
-------------------------------------------

Explanation: The International Date Line is a boundary beetwen one day and next. Also when you pass through it the date changes. While GMT is where all time zones all over the world are measured.

Which meridian represents the International Date Line?
------------------------------------------------------

180° longitude  
The IDL is roughly based on the meridian of 180° longitude, roughly down the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and halfway around the world from the Greenwich meridian. In many places, the IDL follows the 180° meridian exactly.

How many degrees are there between the prime meridian and the International Date Line?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The prime meridian is the 0 degree longitude and the international date line is 180 degrees west and east of the prime meridian. How many degrees longitude are there between the prime meridian and the international dateline?

What do you mean by International Date Line?
--------------------------------------------

Ever heard of the International Date Line or IDL? What about the Greenwich Meridian, or Prime Meridian as it’s called? The International Date Line is an imaginary boundary that runs from east to west along the 180-degree meridian.

How is the International Date Line used to measure latitude?
------------------------------------------------------------

Essentially, it represents the zero-degree mark and separates the east and west hemispheres of the Earth. Every longitude line east or west of this is measured in terms of its proximity to the Prime Meridian. Adversely, the Equator is what is used to measure latitude. What Is the International Date Line for?

Is the International Date Line straight or zigzag?
--------------------------------------------------

The Dateline Is Not Straight. The dateline runs from the North Pole to the South Pole and marks the divide between the Western and Eastern Hemisphere. It is not straight but zigzags to avoid political and country borders and to not cut some countries in half. On timeanddate.com’s Time Zone Map, the IDL is shown as a black line (see image).
