Where do hot ocean currents originate?
--------------------------------------

Warm ocean currents originate near the equator and move towards the poles or higher latitudes while cold currents originate near the poles or higher latitudes and move towards the tropics or lower latitudes. The currentâ€™s direction and speed depend on the shoreline and the ocean floor.

Where do ocean currents come from?
----------------------------------

Ocean currents can be caused by wind, density differences in water masses caused by temperature and salinity variations, gravity, and events such as earthquakes or storms. Currents are cohesive streams of seawater that circulate through the ocean.

What causes heat ocean currents?
--------------------------------

Convection occurs because the oceanic waters heat up becoming less dense. This water moves above the cooler water, and give off its heat to the surrounding environment. As it cools, it begins to sink, and the process begins again. Convection results in the continual circulation of ocean water on a global scale.

What causes ocean currents in the North Atlantic Ocean?
-------------------------------------------------------

Deep ocean currents Differences in water density, resulting from the variability of water temperature (thermo) and salinity (haline), also cause ocean currents. This process is known as thermohaline circulation. In cold regions, such as the North Atlantic Ocean, ocean water loses heat to the atmosphere and becomes cold and dense.

How are the currents in the ocean set in motion?
------------------------------------------------

Major surface ocean currents in the open ocean, however, are set in motion by the wind, which drags on the surface of the water as it blows. The water starts flowing in the same direction as the wind. But currents do not simply track the wind.

How are surface currents related to global climate?
---------------------------------------------------

Surface currents Large-scale surface ocean currents are driven by global wind systems that are fueled by energy from the sun. These currents transfer heat from the tropics to the polar regions, influencing local and global climate.

What kind of currents start near the equator?
---------------------------------------------

Large rotating currents that start near the equator are called subtropical gyres. There are five main gyres: the North and South Pacific Subtropical Gyres, the North and South Atlantic Subtropical Gyres, and the Indian Ocean Subtropical Gyre.
