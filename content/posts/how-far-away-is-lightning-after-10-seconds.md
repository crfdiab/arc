How far away is lightning after 10 seconds?
-------------------------------------------

Use Thunder to Estimate Lightning Strike Distance

<table><tr><th>If you hear thunder…</th><th>The lightning is…</th></tr><tr><td>10 seconds after the flash</td><td>2 miles away</td></tr><tr><td>15 seconds after the flash</td><td>3 miles away</td></tr><tr><td>20 seconds after the flash</td><td>4 miles away</td></tr><tr><td>25 seconds after the flash</td><td>5 miles away</td></tr></table>

How far away is a lightning strike if you count 10 seconds between when you see the flash of lightning and hear the thunder?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every 5 seconds between when you see lightning and when you hear the thunder is one mile. If you count 10 seconds between the lightning and thunder, the lightning struck 2 miles away.

How far away is a lightning strike?
-----------------------------------

Lightning can travel 10 to 12 miles from a thunderstorm. This is often farther than the sound of thunder travels. That means that if you can hear thunder you are close enough to a storm to be in danger of being struck by lightning.

How do you calculate distance from thunder to KM?
-------------------------------------------------

For metric-system conversions, follow this method: Sound travels at about 340 m/s, so multiply the number of seconds you counted by 340, and you’ll know how many meters away lightning struck. A three-second count, then, would place the lightning strike about 1,020 m away, or roughly 1 km.

How do you calculate thunder distance?
--------------------------------------

If you count the number of seconds between the flash of lightning and the sound of thunder, and then divide by 5, you’ll get the distance in miles to the lightning: 5 seconds = 1 mile, 15 seconds = 3 miles, 0 seconds = very close. Keep in mind that you should be in a safe place while counting.

What’s the time interval between a lightning flash and Thunder?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The time interval between a lightning flash and the first sound of thunder was found to be 5 s. If the speed of sound in air is 330 ms−1, find the distance of flash from the observer.

How long does it take to hear thunder after seeing Lightning?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The first 30 is 30 seconds. If it takes less than 30 seconds to hear thunder after seeing a lightning flash, the probability of being struck by lighting is great because the lightning is within 6 miles of your location.

How can you tell the distance between lightning and Thunder?
------------------------------------------------------------

Did you know that you can easily figure out how far you are from a lightning strike by watching the lightning flash and listening to thunder? Thunder and lightning actually happen at the same time, but since light travels faster than sound, you’ll see the light from lightning ahead of the grumbling sound of thunder.

How far away was that lightning?
--------------------------------

The National Weather Service recommends taking cover if the time between the lightning flash and the rumble of thunder is 30 seconds or less, which indicates the lightning is about 6 miles away or closer.
