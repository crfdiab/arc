What are the positive products from volcanoes volcanic eruption?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Sulfur, copper and gold are produced from volcanic activity, Krippner said. Diamonds are also brought up to the surface from the mantle from a rare kind of magma, called kimberlite. “Volcanoes also provide a lot of building materials,” Krippner said.

What are the benefits of volcanic activity in Iceland?
------------------------------------------------------

Volcanic activity is a fact of life in Iceland, that people have learned to live with. It brings problems such as damaging eruptions. It brings benefits such as geothermal energy and beautiful landscapes.

What factors control the way a volcano erupts?
----------------------------------------------

Although there are several factors triggering a volcanic eruption, three predominate: the buoyancy of the magma, the pressure from the exsolved gases in the magma and the injection of a new batch of magma into an already filled magma chamber.

Is Iceland on a volcano?
------------------------

Iceland is one of the most volcanically active places in the world and volcanic activity has shaped this island nation. Iceland is among the most volcanically active places in the world, with roughly one eruption every five years, not including submarine eruptions.

What are the effects of Vulcanicity?
------------------------------------

The negative effects are flight disruptions, health, economic, environmental, livestock and crop destruction. The positive effects identified with the literature include land formation, soil fertility, and tourism. Also a major theme found looks at the measures Iceland has taken to cope with the volcanic activities.

What factors determines whether an eruption will be explosive?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Volcanic eruptions can be explosive, sending ash, gas and lava high up into the atmosphere, or the magma can form lava flows, known as effusive eruptions. Whether an eruption is explosive or effusive largely depends upon the amount of gas in the magma.

Which is the most common type of volcano in Iceland?
----------------------------------------------------

The most common volcanoes in Iceland are composite or stratovolcanoes which stretch out in a line, often across large areas. Shield volcanoes, which are shaped like a warrior´s shield set down on the ground, are also common.

How many years does it take for a volcano to erupt in Iceland?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Some experts use a 4,500 year timescale for dormant volcanoes and a few do not distinguish between dormant and extinct volcanoes at all. Others utilize entirely different timescales. One fact is very certain: Iceland has many active, extinct and dormant volcanoes! Take a look at our volcano tours. Is Iceland a volcanic island?

Where is the subglacial volcano located in Iceland?
---------------------------------------------------

The subglacial volcano is located approximately 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the end of the glacier (where the meltwater emerges). During these jökulhlaups, the glacier’s meltwater carries sediments away from the glacier and deposit it onto a broad plain.

What did Icelanders do with the water from the volcano?
-------------------------------------------------------

The first thing directly useful to Icelanders is the hot water. Rain water or seawater seeps into the ground until finding its way to hot rocks, then the pressure sends it to the surface again, where it comes out in hot springs. In ancient times, people used it for laundry and bathing.
