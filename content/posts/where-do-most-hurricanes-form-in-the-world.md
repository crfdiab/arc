Where do most hurricanes form in the world?
-------------------------------------------

To form, hurricanes need all of the right “ingredients.” As such, these tropical storms occur near shores and coastlines. In particular, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans produce the largest number of tropical cyclones. More specifically, the West Pacific tends to generate far more hurricanes than the Atlantic.

Are there any Hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean?
-----------------------------------------------

People call these storms by other names, such as typhoons or cyclones, depending on where they occur. The scientific term for all these storms is tropical cyclone. Only tropical cyclones that form over the Atlantic Ocean or eastern Pacific Ocean are called “hurricanes.”

Where do most tropical cyclones and typhoons form?
--------------------------------------------------

Most tropical cyclones form from a disturbance in the monsoon trough. The north Atlantic basin is considerably different, as the majority of hurricanes form from easterly waves originating from Africa. Hurricanes and typhoons only can form over large basins of warm water such as an ocean or gulf.

When do hurricanes form in the South Atlantic?
----------------------------------------------

To date, only one hurricane has ever formed in the South Atlantic – Hurricane Catarina – because of how do hurricanes form. Most Atlantic cyclones form between August and September. In any case, the atmosphere has a lot to do with the creation of tropical storms because of how do hurricanes form.

How does a hurricane form in the Atlantic Ocean?
------------------------------------------------

The second ingredient for a tropical cyclone is wind. In the case of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean, the wind blowing westward across the Atlantic from Africa provides the necessary ingredient. As the wind passes over the ocean’s surface, water evaporates (turns into water vapor) and rises.

Can a hurricane form within 300 miles of the equator?
-----------------------------------------------------

Near the equator, where there is no Coriolis effect, hurricanes cannot form within 300 miles (500 kilometers) of the equator. Storms grow if there is a continuous supply of energy from warm ocean water and warm, moist air. Tropical storms can grow into hurricanes, and hurricanes can grow into stronger hurricanes.

When does a tropical storm become a hurricane?
----------------------------------------------

These powerful tropical storms are known as hurricanes in the Atlantic, typhoons in the Pacific and cyclones in the Indian Ocean. Rough weather over tropical waters is classified as a tropical storm when winds reach 39 miles per hour.

What states do hurricanes occur in?
-----------------------------------

Hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean strike the east coast of Mexico and Central America, Bermuda, the Caribbean, Florida, Texas, Louisiana and the southeast coast of the United States and even Canada.

Are there any Hurricanes in the Pacific Ocean?
----------------------------------------------

The Philippines, in the western Pacific Ocean, can get hit with 20 or more tropical storms during hurricane season. Hurricanes in the south Atlantic Ocean are rare, but possible. The only recorded hurricane in the south Atlantic was Hurricane Catarina in 2004.
