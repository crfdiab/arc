What are the lungs of the city?
-------------------------------

The metaphor “lungs of cities”, initially a slogan for the preservation of urban parks, has been retained almost as common sense to the present. It implies that parks provide urban dwellers spaces for breathing in polluted cities.

What are the lungs also known as?
---------------------------------

The trachea (windpipe) conducts inhaled air into the lungs through its tubular branches, called bronchi. The bronchi then divide into smaller and smaller branches (bronchioles), finally becoming microscopic. The bronchioles eventually end in clusters of microscopic air sacs called alveoli.

What are the lungs known for?
-----------------------------

The lungs and respiratory system allow us to breathe. They bring oxygen into our bodies (called inspiration, or inhalation) and send carbon dioxide out (called expiration, or exhalation). This exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is called respiration.

What do you mean by lungs for the city?
---------------------------------------

The goal of the ‘Lungs of the City’ concept is to integrate air cleaning into the existing infrastructure at strategic locations in an (inner) urban area, so that air quality at street level can be improved with an almost invisible intervention. The feasibility of the concept was investigated in 2016.

Are lungs located in front or back?
