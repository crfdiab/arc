Which factors indicate a rapidly growing population?
----------------------------------------------------

Several factors are responsible for the rapid growth: a drop in mortality rates, a young population, improved standards of living, and attitudes and practices which favor high fertility.

How do you determine how fast a population is growing?
------------------------------------------------------

Net reproductive rate (r) is calculated as: r = (births-deaths)/population size or to get in percentage terms, just multiply by 100. the population is so much bigger, many more individuals are added. If a population grows by a constant percentage per year, this eventually adds up to what we call exponential growth.

What was the cause of rapid population growth?
----------------------------------------------

This rapid growth increase was mainly caused by a decreasing death rate (more rapidly than birth rate), and particularly an increase in average human age. By 2000 the population counted 6 billionheads, however, population growth (doubling time) started to decline after 1965 because of decreasing birth rates.

How is the population of the world growing?
-------------------------------------------

THE GROWTH OF WORLD POPULATION. The population of the world, now somewhat in excess of three billion persons, is growing at about two per cent a year, or faster than at any other period in manâ€™s history.

Why is population growth not a simple matter?
---------------------------------------------

It is however not a simple matter of a constant doubling of the amount. Other factors, such as fertility and mortality rates, influence population growth, and the sexe and age of people already present, and rational decisions influence whether or not people will actually have one or more children.

Which is the region with the fastest population growth?
-------------------------------------------------------

If you want to see the relative distribution across the world regions in more detail you can switch to the relative view. The world region that saw the fastest population growth over last two centuries was North America. The population grew 31-fold. Latin America saw the second largest increase (28-fold).
