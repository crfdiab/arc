Do all comets orbit the Sun?
----------------------------

Comets orbit the Sun just like planets and asteroids do, except a comet usually has a very elongated orbit.

Does a meteor orbit the Sun?
----------------------------

Meteoroids are lumps of rock or iron that orbit the sun, just as planets, asteroids, and comets do. They orbit the sun among the rocky inner planets, as well as the gas giants that make up the outer planets. Meteoroids are even found on the edge of the solar system, in regions called the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud.

How long can a comet orbit the Sun?
-----------------------------------

These Oort Cloud comets can take as long as 30 million years to complete one trip around the Sun. Each comet has a tiny frozen part, called a nucleus, often no larger than a few kilometers across.

Why do comets orbit differently than planets?
---------------------------------------------

The orbits of comets are different from those of planets – they are elliptical. A comet’s orbit takes it very close to the Sun and then far away again. The time to complete an orbit varies – some comets take a few years, while others take millions of years to complete an orbit.

What’s the difference between a comet and a meteor?
---------------------------------------------------

Comet: A body of ice, rock and dust that can be several miles in diameter and orbits the sun. It originates from a comet or asteroid. Meteor: A meteoroid that enters the earth’s atmosphere and vaporizes. Also called a “shooting star.”

Do comets ever stop?
--------------------

After many orbits near the Sun, a comet does eventually “expire.” In some cases, all the volatile ices boil away, leaving a remnant of rock and dust. Sometime the comet completely disintegrates. So it is understandable that it might take more than a few years for all that ice to evaporate!

Are comets hot or cold?
-----------------------

Even though the Oort Cloud is much further, comets way out in both regions are at temperatures of about -220 degrees Celsius (-364 degrees Fahrenheit). Of course,, if you sit around the fire, you are warm. But if you stick your hand in the fire, you burn yourself. That’s the same thing comets can do.

Is there any space around the Sun for comets?
---------------------------------------------

To truly appreciate the orbits of comets, it helps to have an understanding of planetary orbits. Even though there’s no lack of available space around the sun, the planets all confine themselves to a fairly thin band, and none of them, except for Pluto, stray more than a few degrees outside it.

How are comets different from the planets in the Solar System?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Comets may orbit the Sun in a retrograde motion, meaning they orbit the Sun the opposite direction to the planets. All objects orbit the Sun in an ellipse, that is not a perfect circle. Planets have a low eccentricity, that is they are very circle-like. They are not very elliptical.

How is the orbit of a comet determined?
---------------------------------------

Astronomers deduce the orbit of a comet by studying its trajectory over a period of time. Comets that return to orbit the Sun are said to have elliptical comets. These move toward and away from the Sun at a speed less than the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System.

When is a comet too far away to see?
------------------------------------

A comet can only be seen when it is near. our solar system, close to the Sun. At other times the comet is too far away to be seen. The speed of a comet changes during its orbit. As the comet gets closer to the Sun, the Sun’s gravity pulls the comet towards it and the.
