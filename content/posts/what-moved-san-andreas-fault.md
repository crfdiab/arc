What moved San Andreas Fault?
-----------------------------

The San Andreas Fault marks the junction between the North American and Pacific Plates. Although both plates are moving in a north westerly direction, the Pacific Plate is moving faster than the North American Plate, so the relative movement of the North American Plate is to the south east.

What fault line runs through San Francisco?
-------------------------------------------

San Andreas Fault  
The San Andreas Fault It divides the state with San Diego, Los Angeles and Big Sur on the Pacific Plate. San Francisco, Sacramento and the Sierra Nevada are on the North American Plate. The two plates crisscross with many active and passive earthquake faults.

What fault caused the San Francisco earthquake?
-----------------------------------------------

The quake was caused by a slip of the San Andreas Fault over a segment about 275 miles long, and shock waves could be felt from southern Oregon down to Los Angeles.

What plate boundary was the San Francisco earthquake on?
--------------------------------------------------------

San Andreas fault  
The Pacific Plate (on the west) slides horizontally northwestward relative to the North American Plate (on the east), causing earthquakes along the San Andreas and associated faults. The San Andreas fault is a transform plate boundary, accomodating horizontal relative motions.

What kind of fault is in San Francisco?
---------------------------------------

The San Andreas Fault is one of the most well-known faults in the San Francisco area. It is a strike slip fault. This is also the fault that is believed to have caused both the 1906 Earthquake &amp; Fire and the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake.

How is San Francisco vulnerable to an earthquake?
-------------------------------------------------

San Francisco is very vulnerable to earthquakes. Its three notable faults, covered below, are right-lateral strike-slip faults. This is a type of shearing force where the right block moves toward the fault and the left block moves away. Millions of Bay Area residents live near active fault zones.

When was the last earthquake in San Francisco?
----------------------------------------------

The San Andreas fault caused the biggest earthquakes in California with an approximate magnitude 7.9 in 1857 (Southern California) and 1906 (San Francisco). History shows that five large earthquakes on the Hayward fault have occurred on average every 150 years—last being in 1868.
