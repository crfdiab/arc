Why should we be omnivores?
---------------------------

The simple answer is humans are omnivores – physiologically – because we have the capability to digest both plant and animal matter. Many humans are behavioural omnivores as well, consuming both as part of their diet, although many people can and do live while consuming only plant products.

Are humans the only omnivores?
------------------------------

Humans are definitely omnivores. The best evidence is our teeth: we have biting/tearing/ripping incisors and canines (like carnivores) and chewing molars (like herbivores). Animals with such diverse teeth tend to be omnivores. Lastly, our closest evolutionary relatives, the chimpanzees, are omnivores.

Why are omnivores important to the food chain?
----------------------------------------------

An omnivore is an organism that eats plants and animals. The term stems from the Latin words omnis, meaning “all or everything,” and vorare, meaning “to devour or eat.”. Omnivores play an important part of the food chain, a sequence of organisms that produce energy and nutrients for other organisms.

Are there any animals that are omnivores and herbivores?
--------------------------------------------------------

But if they find a dead animal, they eat it. Many animals that are often thought of as carnivores are in fact omnivores. Red foxes, for example, prey on rabbits, but they also eat fruit. Some animals that are thought of as herbivores also eat animals.

How are omnivores adapted to live in their habitat?
---------------------------------------------------

But omnivores such as opossums, seagulls, and many species of monkey easily adapt to life in urban area s and farmland, where they often find meals in garbage cans. Omnivores can often adapt well to changes in their habitat by adjusting their diet.

Why are omnivores the most flexible eaters in the world?
--------------------------------------------------------

Omnivores are the most flexible eaters of the animal kingdom. They eat both plants and meat, and many times what they eat depends on what is available to them. When meat is scarce, many animals will fill their diets with vegetation and vice versa, according to National Geographic . Animal omnivores (including humans) come in many different sizes.
