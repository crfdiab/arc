What rock cools quickly above ground?
-------------------------------------

Volcanic rocks  
Volcanic rocks, which cool quickly above ground, have small crystals because the crystals did not have enough time to grow very large. The type of igneous rock is also dependent on its composition (the elements that are present). There are many different compositions of magma and lava.

What is the name of the rock that has cooled quickly after a volcanic eruption?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obsidian: I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a volcano erupt, but it happens very quickly. The magma or melted rock that comes out of a volcano sometimes cools and hardens very, very quickly too. When you go from a liquid to a solid this fast, you don’t have time to form crystals. Instead, you turn into glass.

What type of rock is formed by cooling lava above ground?
---------------------------------------------------------

igneous rock  
Extrusive, or volcanic, igneous rock is produced when magma exits and cools above (or very near) the Earth’s surface. These are the rocks that form at erupting volcanoes and oozing fissures.

What kind of rock is formed after a volcanic eruption?
------------------------------------------------------

Igneous rock is formed by the cooling and solidification of molten Earth materials. Igneous rock forms when magma or lava cools. If an igneous rock forms above ground after a volcanic eruption, it forming igneous rock, such as obsidian which is a naturally occurring volcanic glass.

What kind of crystals form when lava cools?
-------------------------------------------

When magma cools underground, it cools very slowly and when lava cools above ground, it cools quickly. When magma and lava cool, mineral crystals start to form in the molten rock. Plutonic rocks, which cool slowly underground, have large crystals because the crystals had enough time to grow to a large size.

How can you tell if a rock is plutonic or volcanic?
---------------------------------------------------

This tells us if the rock is plutonic or volcanic. When magma cools underground, it cools very slowly and when lava cools above ground, it cools quickly. When magma and lava cool, mineral crystals start to form in the molten rock.

How does an extrusive igneous rock form above ground?
-----------------------------------------------------

Rock that forms by the freezing of lava above ground, after it flows or explodes out (extrudes) onto the surface and comes into contact with the atmosphere or ocean. extrusive igneous rock
