Why are some scientists concerned about an increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Climate scientists are so concerned about carbon dioxide because the more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the hotter the earth will become, changing the Earth’s climate. Scientists have known and understood this for over 100 years, and it has been confirmed by measurements and in laboratory experiments.

Why does increasing CO2 increase photosynthesis?
------------------------------------------------

Elevated \[CO2\] increases the availability of carbon in leaves causing greater Rubisco activity and higher rates of photosynthesis. Greater photosynthesis increases the content of non-structural carbohydrates in leaves which can lead to greater starch reserves and increased auxin biosynthesis.

How might increased carbon dioxide affect plant growth?
-------------------------------------------------------

Rising carbon dioxide concentrations will increase plant growth. More rapid leaf area development and more total leaf area could translate into more transpiration. Rising carbon dioxide concentrations will decrease leaf stomatal conductance to water vapor. This effect could reduce transpiration.

How does carbon dioxide affect food?
------------------------------------

It could cause a global malnutrition crisis. Rising carbon dioxide levels could have a dangerous effect on global malnutrition. High carbon dioxide levels have been shown to reduce rice’s nutritional content.

What are the consequences of increased co2?
-------------------------------------------

Carbon dioxide increases temperatures, extending the growing season and increasing humidity. Both factors have led to some additional plant growth. However, warmer temperatures also stress plants. With a longer, warmer growing season, plants need more water to survive.

Do plants grow better in high co2?
----------------------------------

Higher concentrations of carbon dioxide make plants more productive because photosynthesis relies on using the sun’s energy to synthesise sugar out of carbon dioxide and water. Plants and ecosystems use the sugar both as an energy source and as the basic building block for growth.

What are the negative impacts of rising CO2 levels on Earth?
------------------------------------------------------------

Greenhouse gases have far-ranging environmental and health effects. They cause climate change by trapping heat, and they also contribute to respiratory disease from smog and air pollution. Extreme weather, food supply disruptions, and increased wildfires are other effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gases.

How does increasing CO2 emissions decrease food security?
---------------------------------------------------------

Higher atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) increase the growth of cereal crops. At the same time, CO2 decreases the nutritional value of key staple crops, particularly rice and wheat, by lowering concentrations of protein, micronutrients, and B vitamins.

What should my CO2 level be?
----------------------------

The normal range is 23 to 29 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) or 23 to 29 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

How are crops affected by increased carbon dioxide levels?
----------------------------------------------------------

But when grown at doubled carbon dioxide levels, all four crops fare better due to increased photosynthesis and crop water productivity, partially offsetting the impacts from those adverse climate changes.

What happens to food production if CO2 levels are cut?
------------------------------------------------------

Worse, if CO2 levels are cut, he warns, food production will slow because plants grown at higher CO2 levels make larger fruit and vegetables and also use less water. He also said that higher CO2 levels are not harmful to humans.

Why is the level of carbon dioxide in the air rising?
-----------------------------------------------------

As the level of carbon dioxide in the air continues to rise because of human activity, scientists are trying to pin down how the plants we eat are being affected.

How does carbon dioxide affect the quality of rice?
---------------------------------------------------

Across the different types of rice, they observed average decreases of 10 percent in protein, 8 percent in iron and 5 percent in zinc. Four important B vitamins decreased between 13 and 30 percent. The research was recently published in Science Advances. Higher carbon dioxide is not just affecting rice.
