Do lines of latitude run up and down or side to side?
-----------------------------------------------------

Tell students that the lines running across the page are lines of latitude, and the lines running up and down the page are lines of longitude. Latitude runs 0–90° north and south. Longitude runs 0–180° east and west.

Which way do lines of longitude run?
------------------------------------

Longitude is the measurement east or west of the prime meridian. Longitude is measured by imaginary lines that run around the Earth vertically (up and down) and meet at the North and South Poles. These lines are known as meridians.

Do lines of latitude run horizontally?
--------------------------------------

Horizontal mapping lines on Earth are lines of latitude. They are known as “parallels” of latitude, because they run parallel to the equator.

Where do lines of latitude and longitude run?
---------------------------------------------

Latitude lines run east-west, but measure north and south. Longitude lines run north-south, but measure east and west. Home Science Math and Arithmetic

Where does the latitude run halfway between the Poles?
------------------------------------------------------

Halfway between the poles lies the equator. Latitude is the angular measurement of a place expressed in degrees north or south of the equator. Latitude runs from 0° at the equator to 90°N or 90°S at the poles. Lines of latitude run in an east-west direction. They are called parallels because they are equally distant from, LONGITUDE

How to remember the difference between latitude and longitude?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to remember the difference between latitude and longitude is by associating the terms with different parts of a ladder. Lines of latitude run east and west. Lines of latitude run horizontally around the Earth and tell you how far north or south you are from the Equator. Image: NASA, public domain.

How are lines of longitude measured from pole to pole?
------------------------------------------------------

Lines of longitude, called meridians, run in a north-south direction from pole to pole. Longitude is the angular measurement of a place east or west of the prime meridian. The International Date Line follows the 180° meridian, making a few jogs to avoid cutting through land areas.
