Why the renewable energy sources were given a lot of importance now days?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What’s the percentage of renewable energy in US?
------------------------------------------------

And the previously mentioned NREL study found that renewable energy could comfortably provide up to 80 percent of US electricity by 2050. Energy expert Paula Garcia talks about the growth of renewable energy across the globe and in the United States.
