What countries use nuclear the most?
------------------------------------

The United States has the most operational nuclear reactors on the planet – 96. Together they have a capacity of 97,565 MW, and last year nuclear energy made up about 20% of the country’s electricity generation. France is home to 58 nuclear reactors, which produce about 75% of the country’s electricity.

How much nuclear energy does the US use compared to other countries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The USA is the world’s largest producer of nuclear power, accounting for more than 30% of worldwide nuclear generation of electricity. The country’s nuclear reactors produced 843 billion kWh in 2019, about 19% of total electrical output.

Which countries use the least nuclear energy?
---------------------------------------------

Nuclear Power-Free Countries

- Belgium.
- Denmark.
- Germany (off nuclear power by 2022)
- Japan.
- Scotland (100% renewable by 2020)
- Spain.
- Sweden.
- Switzerland. Why is nuclear energy not used more in the US?
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    2\) Fossil fuels are cheap, and wind and solar are getting less expensive. And while solar and wind can’t produce energy at anywhere near the level of nuclear (or even coal and gas), the cost of each technology has decreased by 80 percent and 60 percent respectively since 2009, according to the financial firm Lazard.
    
    Which is the best country for nuclear energy?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    Surprisingly smaller countries like Slovakia, Belgium, Ukraine and Armenia complete the top five list. All these countries generate an average of more than 50% of the total electricity generated from nuclear energy. The Top 10 Countries that Use Nuclear Energy Power Plants in Terms of Percentage of Electricity Generated from Nuclear Energy
    
    Are there any countries without a nuclear power plant?
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
    A July 2017 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on International Status and Prospects of Nuclear Power1 said that some 28 member states without nuclear power plants “are considering, planning or starting” nuclear power programmes at present.
    
    Why are nuclear power plants needed In less developed countries?
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    
    However, in the longer term, the trend to urbanisation in less-developed countries will greatly increase the demand for electricity, and especially that supplied by base-load plants such as nuclear. The pattern of energy demand in these countries will become more like that of Europe, North America and Japan.
    
    Which is the first country to use nuclear power?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    The Top 10 Countries that use Nuclear Energy Power Plants in Terms of Megawatts of Energy Although the United States ranks first in the amount of energy produced (in megawatts) from nuclear power plants, it is France that leads the pack when the percentage of electricity generated from nuclear energy is concerned.
