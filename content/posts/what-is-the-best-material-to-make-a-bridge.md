What is the best material to make a bridge?
-------------------------------------------

Steel  
Best Material for Bridges: Steel Steel is a versatile building material, used for centuries in various capacities. Its strength and permanence are ideal for long-lasting structures, like bridges. The use of steel for bridges replaced earlier materials such as wood, concrete and stone.

Which local materials can you use for building a bridge?
--------------------------------------------------------

Steel and concrete are the most popular choices for modern bridge construction. Other materials include wood, iron (a different type of steel), plastic and stone. Before the availability of steel and concrete, most bridges were made of wood, rope and/or stone.

What are the disadvantages of a beam bridge?
--------------------------------------------

Disadvantages of beam bridges:

- Can be expensive, even for fairly short spans. A cheap material for beam bridges is concrete.
- Very expensive for long spans, because piers have to be built.
- It is not always possible to build support piers. What are the strengths of a beam bridge?
    ----------------------------------------
    
    List of the Pros of a Beam Bridge
    
    
    - Beam bridges are an affordable building option.
    - They can be built very quickly.
    - There are multiple design options available for beam bridges.
    - Multiple material options are available to use for beam bridges.
    - They can be placed almost anywhere.
    - There are span limitations to beam bridges.
    
    What 4 things do you consider when building a bridge?
    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    While constructing a pedestrian bridge, there are several important factors to take into consideration.
    
    
    - Width. The width of a pedestrian bridge is dependent on the type of traveller and amount of traffic the bridge will receive.
    - Site Conditions.
    - Geotech Analysis.
    - Safety.
    - Durability.
    
    What is the average cost of a beam bridge?
    ------------------------------------------
    
    Costs vary from $140 to $180/square foot, depending on bridge complexity. In addition to the bridge itself, there are lots of opportunities to save construction time and money through the use of simple designs and construction details.
    
    What is bad about beam bridge?
    ------------------------------
    
    Beam bridges are often only used for relatively short distances because, unlike truss bridges, they have no built-in supports. Since the supports for a beam bridge are typically very far apart, it can be difficult for the bridge to maintain its structural integrity over the long haul.
    
    What is good about the beam bridge?
    -----------------------------------
    
    The design of a beam bridge is considered to be the most affordable of any bridge design that is currently in use. For areas that are low on resources, but require a bridge, this design is an effective option to use. On smaller spans, the bridge can be as simple as two beams with a deck built across it.
    
    Which software is used for bridge design?
    -----------------------------------------
    
    Best Softwares That Professionals Use For Bridge Designing
    
    
    - AutoCAD (Automatic Computer-Aided Design) If you are into the construction field, then it is impossible that you have not heard of AutoCAD.
    - MIDAS Civil.
    - STAAD Pro.
    - CSiBridge.
    - LARSA 4D Bridge Series.
    - Autodesk Structural Bridge Design.
    - RISA.
    
    Which is the best material for a beam bridge?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    Notice how the top notch squeezes together in compression, while the bottom notch spreads apart under tension. Prestressed concrete (see sidebar at right) is an ideal material for beam bridge construction. The concrete withstands the forces of compression well, and the steel rods embedded within resist the forces of tension.
    
    What can steel be used for in a bridge?
    ---------------------------------------
    
    It can also be used for cast-in-place or precast concrete piles to support the abutments and piers. Steel Steel is commonly used in the bridge superstructure for armoring expansion joints, beams, bearings, floor beams, girders, reinforcing bars in concrete, traffic barriers and trusses.
    
    What kind of materials are used for RCC bridges?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    RCC is nowadays made from steel, polymer or other combination of composite materials. Much sustainable materials is available that can take the role of cement. This is a new innovation in sustainable bridge construction. When compared with RCC bridge construction, prestressed concrete is the most preferred and employed.
    
    What kind of concrete is used to build bridges?
    -----------------------------------------------
    
    Other factors to which concrete is susceptible are the thermal expansion and shrinkage effects. Creep is formed in concrete due to long time stress on it. The mechanical properties of concrete are determined by the compressive strength of concrete. The reinforced or the prestressed concrete is used for the construction of bridges.
