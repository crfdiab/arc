What granted freedom of worship to Huguenots?
---------------------------------------------

Then, on April 13, 1598, as the newly crowned Henry IV, he issued the Edict of Nantes, which granted to the Huguenots toleration and liberty to worship in their own way. Huguenots were ordered to renounce their faith and join the Catholic Church.

Why was the Edict of Nantes so important?
-----------------------------------------

Nantes, Edict of (1598) French royal decree establishing toleration for Huguenots (Protestants). It granted freedom of worship and legal equality for Huguenots within limits, and ended the Wars of Religion. The Edict was revoked by Louis XIV in 1685, causing many Huguenots to emigrate.

What did Henry IV do for the Huguenots?
---------------------------------------

Henry IV established also the Edict of Nantes of 1598, which granted the Huguenots complete freedom of conscience and worship, and gave them their own churches, cemeteries, schools, hospitals, and even public benefits. He granted them up to 50% representation in the various parliaments, and permitted them to establish 4 academies.

Why were Huguenots not allowed to practice their religion?
----------------------------------------------------------

Huguenots were not permitted to practice within towns or at night, and in an effort to sate fears of rebellion, they were not allowed to be armed. On March 1, 1562, 300 Huguenots holding religious services in a barn outside the town wall of Vassy, France, were attacked by troops under the command of Francis, Duke of Guise.

What was the result of the Huguenot edict?
------------------------------------------

In the short term, it provoked the flight of about 200,000 Huguenots to other countries. Its consequences, however, went even further. But why was that earlier edict in favor of religious tolerance revoked?

Where did the massacre of the Huguenots take place?
---------------------------------------------------

On March 1, 1562, French troops massacred Huguenots at worship and other Huguenot citizens in Wassy, France, in what is known as the Massacre of Wassy (or Vassy). Francis, Duke of Guise, ordered the massacre, reportedly after heâ€™d stopped in Wassy to attend a Mass and found a group of Huguenots worshipping in a barn.
