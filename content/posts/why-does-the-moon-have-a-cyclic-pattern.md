Why does the Moon have a cyclic pattern?
----------------------------------------

During the course of a month, we see many different phases of the Moon. Why do you think this happens? These changing phases happen because the Sun illuminates the Moon’s surface as the Moon revolves around Earth. This change in the illuminated surface of the Moon is called the lunar cycle.

Are the phases of the Moon cyclic?
----------------------------------

Our Moon doesn’t shine, it reflects. Just like daytime here on Earth, sunlight illuminates the Moon. These eight phases are, in order, new Moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full Moon, waning gibbous, third quarter and waning crescent. The cycle repeats once a month (every 29.5 days).

What is the correct cyclical pattern of the moon?
-------------------------------------------------

Answer: New moon, Waxing Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous, Full moon, Waning Gibbous, Last Quarter, and finally Waning Crescent. As you probably already know, a full moon is when the entire moon face is completely illuminated by the sun. Full moons occur when the sun and moon are on opposite sides of Earth.

What happens after a Full Moon?
-------------------------------

After the full moon (maximum illumination), the light continually decreases. So the waning gibbous phase occurs next. Following the third quarter is the waning crescent, which wanes until the light is completely gone — a new moon.

Why does the Moon appear to go through phases?

The Moon appears to go through phases. In other words, the amount of the Moon that we can see changes over time in a cyclic period that repeats itself approximately once a month. (The actual period of this cycle is approximately 29.5 Earth days.) The cause of these phases is the relative positions of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.

That”s how our cycles are connected, as well as the four lunar phases: new moon, crescent moon, full moon and fourth quarter.
