What is it called when there is little water?
---------------------------------------------

Dehydration is the term for your body’s reaction when you don’t drink enough water, resulting in a fluid deficiency. Chronic dehydration is a condition when dehydration recurs for longer periods, sometimes regardless of how much fluid you take in on a particular day.

What does a drought look like?
------------------------------

What does it mean when it’s raining on and off all day?
