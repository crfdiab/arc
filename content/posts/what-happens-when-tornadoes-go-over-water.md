What happens when tornadoes go over water?
------------------------------------------

Tornadic waterspouts are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water. This type of waterspout is generally not associated with thunderstorms. While tornadic waterspouts develop downward in a thunderstorm, a fair weather waterspout develops on the surface of the water and works its way upward.

What is the name given to a tornado that only forms over open water?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

These eerie columns of rotating air are known as waterspouts — commonly defined as tornadoes over water. Waterspouts usually develop over warm tropical ocean waters.

What are the characteristics of a waterspout tornado?
-----------------------------------------------------

A waterspout is a whirling column of air and water mist. Tornadic waterspouts are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water. They have the same characteristics as a land tornado. They are associated with severe thunderstorms, and are often accompanied by high winds and seas, large hail, and frequent dangerous lightning.

How is a tornado classified as a funnel cloud?
----------------------------------------------

A tornado is “a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud”. For a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base.

How is a tornado in contact with the ground?
--------------------------------------------

A tornado is a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud. For a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base.

How are tornadoes obscured by rain or dust?
-------------------------------------------

Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. Tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes. Small, relatively weak landspouts may be visible only as a small swirl of dust on the ground.
