What is result of acid rain?
----------------------------

Acid rain leaches aluminum from the soil. That aluminum may be harmful to plants as well as animals. Acid rain also removes minerals and nutrients from the soil that trees need to grow. The trees are then less able to absorb sunlight, which makes them weak and less able to withstand freezing temperatures.

Why is acid rain an indirect result of air pollution?
-----------------------------------------------------

Acid rain, smog, ocean acidification and global warming are indirect result of air pollution because these factors are interconnected. Water contains gas like carbon dioxide, but too much carbon dioxide makes the water acidic. Water contains gas like carbon dioxide, but too much carbon dioxide makes the water acidic.

What metal is immune to acid?
-----------------------------

Metallic acid-resistant materials include wrought and cast high-alloy steels; nickel-, copper-, and aluminum-based alloys; and certain pure metals, such as nickel, aluminum, copper, and lead. The use of titanium and its alloys has promising possibilities.

How is acid rain harmful to the environment?
--------------------------------------------

The Effects of Air Pollution: Acid Rain 1 Acidifying Waters. Water resists rapid changes to pH — a measure of the acidity of a substance with lower numbers indicating stronger acidity. 2 Forests. Direct contact with acid rain can weaken trees and destroy their leaves. 3 Cars. 4 Buildings. 5 Human Health. …

Where does acid rain come from in the atmosphere?
-------------------------------------------------

Often associated with precipitation, the term also applies to dry acidic materials. These acids commonly result from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides reacting with moisture and other substances in the atmosphere. Although there are natural sources for these chemicals, much attention has been given to man-made sources, such as coal power plants.

How does acid rain affect high altitude forests?
------------------------------------------------

Forests. Direct contact with acid rain can weaken trees and destroy their leaves. This is especially true in high altitude forests where the trees are frequently immersed in an acid cloud. Acid rain can also harm trees in a more subtle fashion by reducing nutrient levels and increasing the level of toxic substances in the soil.

Where are the highest acid rain levels in the United States?
------------------------------------------------------------

Northeastern cities such as Pittsburgh have some of the highest acid rain levels in the United States (see References 3).
