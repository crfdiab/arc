What is a type of earth movement resulting from the compression of rock?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Folding: Is a type of earth movement resulting from the horizontal compression of rock layers by internal forces of the earth along plate boundaries.

What type of fault does compression cause?
------------------------------------------

The body of rock above the fault is called the hanging wall, and the body of rock below it is called the footwall. If the fault develops in a situation of compression, then it will be a reverse fault because the compression causes the hanging wall to be pushed up relative to the footwall.

Which faults form from compression forces?
------------------------------------------

Reverse dip-slip faults  
Reverse dip-slip faults result from horizontal compressional forces caused by a shortening, or contraction, of Earth’s crust. The hanging wall moves up and over the footwall. Thrust faults are reverse faults that dip less than 45°.

What are the 3 types of motion of the earth?
--------------------------------------------

4 The Earth’s Three Motions. The Earth turns (rotation around the polar axis), goes along on its orbit (revolution around the Sun), swings smoothly as un unbalanced spinning top (equinoctial precession).

Where are the three landforms produced by compression?
------------------------------------------------------

The three landforms produced by compression are the central Appalachian mountains in Pennsylvania, the Himalayas in Asia, and the Alps in Europe.

Which is land form is produced by tension?
------------------------------------------

What land form is produced by tension? The three landforms produced by compression are the central Appalachian mountains in Pennsylvania, the Himalayas in Asia, and the Alps in Europe.

How are forces of compression lead to the formation of Fold Mountains?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Push the cloth with your both hands towards its centre, it will form wrinkles rising into up and down folds. Likewise rock strata also bend in the same fashion when forces of compression act on them from opposite directions. In this way, the compressional forces lead to the bending of rock layers and thus lead to the formation of fold mountains.

How are the different types of landforms created?
-------------------------------------------------

Earth Sciences: Types of Landforms. Landforms are defined as the natural physical features found on the surface of the earth created as a result of various forces of nature such as wind, water, ice, and movement of tectonic plates. Some landforms are created in a matter of few hours, while others take millions of years to appear.
