What is the process of removing salt from water?
------------------------------------------------

Simply put, desalination is the process of removing salt from the water. Of course, when attempting to create a large drinking water supply for a large population, the process involves large plants and a fairly expensive process.

How is the salt of the sea obtained?
------------------------------------

The salt so obtained is collected and transported to big factories, where it is purified and packed for consumtions The salt can be easily obtained from sea water because sea water contains salty water. If we boil this water, the water will get evaporated, leaving behind only the salt.

How do you separate salt from sea water?
----------------------------------------

Keep the water at a steady boil to evaporate it, turning the heat down when the liquid becomes thick. Continue boiling the water until most of the water has evaporated and you’re left with a thick paste. You are speeding up the classic process of allowing shallow pools of seawater to dry in the sun.

How is desalination used to make water drinkable?
-------------------------------------------------

Quite simply, desalination, the process of removing salt from water and making it drinkable and useable for agriculture, could be at least part of the answer. Most of the world’s water – about 96% – is saline water, or water that contains dissolved salt. Simply put, desalination is the process of removing salt from the water.

How do you get salt water out of sea water?
-------------------------------------------

Keep the water at a steady boil to evaporate it, turning the heat down when the liquid becomes thick. Continue boiling the water until most of the water has evaporated and you’re left with a thick paste. You are speeding up the classic process of allowing shallow pools of seawater to dry in the sun.

How does desalination of salt water create fresh water?
-------------------------------------------------------

Desalination (also spelled desalinization) is the process of creating fresh water by removing saline (salt) from bodies of salt water.

How does decanoic acid remove salt from water?
----------------------------------------------

This process allows you to collect both the salt and the water. This technique involves removing the water from the salt by forcing it through a permeable membrane. The membrane only allows the water to pass through, leaving the salt behind. In this technique, decanoic acid is added to salt water, heated slightly, and then cooled.
