Who was the first man on earth?
-------------------------------

Biblical Adam (man, mankind) is created from adamah (earth), and Genesis 1–8 makes considerable play of the bond between them, for Adam is estranged from the earth through his disobedience.

When did man first appear on Earth?
-----------------------------------

On the biggest steps in early human evolution scientists are in agreement. The first human ancestors appeared between five million and seven million years ago, probably when some apelike creatures in Africa began to walk habitually on two legs.

What would happen if humans never wore clothes?
-----------------------------------------------

With no clothes, we may not have risen to the top of the food chain, nor have survived the cold north. Humans would be focused around warmer areas until clothes were invented. Humans would not be the dominant race of the world without clothes.

Where did the first man on Earth come from?
-------------------------------------------

The theory asserts that humans first evolved in Africa, and most of man’s time on earth has been on that continent. Here are six reasons why scientists believe humans originated in Africa and why they have abandoned the notion we evolved separately and independently in different parts of the world.

What is the origin of Man in Africa?
------------------------------------

May 24, 2013 by Andrew Keet. The recent African “Origin of Man” theory or Recent African Origin (RAO) model is designed to explain the origin of earliest humans in Africa. This continent is believed to be the Cradle of Humankind, the first point from which humans originated.

What was the name of the first continent on Earth?
--------------------------------------------------

Explanation: The first supercontinent was called Ur or Vaalbara which exisited between 3,600 and 2,800 million years ago. Supercontinents break up and reform over time. Subsequent supercontinents were Kenorland, Protopangaea, Columbia, Rhodinia and Pannotia.

Who are the ancestors of all modern humans?
-------------------------------------------

According to the scientists who published the study, the San are direct descendants of the first population of early human ancestors. These are the ancestors of all Africans and, by extension, all modern humans, as it is believed that early human migration from Africa is what populated the other continents.
