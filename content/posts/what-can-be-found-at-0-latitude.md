What can be found at 0 latitude?
--------------------------------

The Equator  
A circle of latitude is an imaginary ring linking all points sharing a parallel. The Equator is the line of 0 degrees latitude.

Where is the prime meridian on the globe?
-----------------------------------------

0° longitude  
The prime meridian is the line of 0° longitude, the starting point for measuring distance both east and west around the Earth. The prime meridian is arbitrary, meaning it could be chosen to be anywhere….Vocabulary.

How many number of latitudes are there on the globe?
----------------------------------------------------

180\. Latitude ranges from 0 to 90 degrees latitude in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Each degree is divided into 60 portions called minutes however, and you could consider each of those 10,800 be lines of latitude. Each minute can also be divided into 60 portions called seconds.

Are there degrees of longitude in the northern hemisphere?
----------------------------------------------------------

Such circles are known as the Degrees of Longitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere, the latitudes are designated as degrees north (°N). For instance, 10°N, 20°N, and so on till 90°N (which is the North Pole). Similarly, there are latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere.

Which is a special pair of latitudes and longitudes?
----------------------------------------------------

But only one point lies on a particular pair of latitude and longitude. So latitudes and longitudes are helpful in locating a point on earth. The Arctic Circle and the Tropic of Cancer are the special latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere.

Why are there 360 Longitudes in the world?
------------------------------------------

There are 360 longitudes because there are 179 meridians at the Western hemisphere, 179 meridians at the Eastern hemisphere. There are also one prime meridian and the 180° meridian. They are neither in the Western H. nor in the Eastern H., because the 180° meridian and the prime meridian are the reason why the Western and Eastern hemispheres exist.
