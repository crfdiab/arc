---------------------------------------------

According to the USGS, earthquakes of magnitude 10 or larger cannot happen. The largest earthquake ever recorded was a magnitude 9.5. It occurred in 1960 near Valdivia, Chile, where the Nazca plate subducts under the South American plate.

How rare is a magnitude 7 earthquake?
-------------------------------------

<table><tr><th>Magnitude</th><th>Earthquake Effects</th><th>Estimated Number Each Year</th></tr><tr><td>6.1 to 6.9</td><td>May cause a lot of damage in very populated areas.</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>7.0 to 7.9</td><td>Major earthquake. Serious damage.</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>8.0 or greater</td><td>Great earthquake. Can totally destroy communities near the epicenter.</td><td>One every 5 to 10 years</td></tr></table>

---------------------------------------------------

Earthquake Effects Estimated Number Each Year 2.5 or less Usually not felt, but can be recorded by seismograph. 900,000 2.5 to 5.4 Often felt, but only causes minor damage. 30,000 5.5 to 6.0 Slight damage to buildings and other structures. 500 6.1 to 6.9 May cause a lot of damage in very populated areas. 100 7.0 to 7.9 Major earthquake.
