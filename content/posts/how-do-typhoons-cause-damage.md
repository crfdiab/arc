How do typhoons cause damage?
-----------------------------

Infamous for their destructive powers, typhoons can generate winds of more than 75 miles per hour and cause major flooding through their intense rainfall and storm surges. Their effects range from structural damage to trees, watercraft, and buildings to both immediate and long-term impacts on human life and livelihood.

What happens to trees during typhoons?
--------------------------------------

Typhoons are one of the most important natural disturbances, which affect forest stand structures and dynamics in various ways such as by snapping branches, stripping leaves and fruits, uprooting trunks and breaking stem.

How do storms affect forests?
-----------------------------

There are ways to weather the storm and improve your forest’s chances of survival. High winds that topple trees and heavy rains that cause flooding are two of the major ways that hurricanes damage a forest. High winds can also cause trees to break, twist and bend, and may cause wounds and root damage.

How do typhoons affect plants?
------------------------------

Plant life can easily be swept away by floods and severe winds. Even trees cannot withstand the sheer force of a typhoon’s strength indefinitely. Excessive rain can cause plants to drown, and it also causes soil erosion.

How do storms affect trees?
---------------------------

High winds and saturated soil conditions typical of summer storms can cause tree roots to fail and branches to weaken. During winter, the weight of ice and snow accumulation can be equally damaging, resulting in failure of branches and entire trees.

Do forests get windy?
---------------------

Most trees develop enough wind firmness to withstand the typical weather conditions of the area in which they grow. But their wind firmness may not be enough for unusually strong storms or worst-case winds.

What are the major causes of tropical deforestation?
----------------------------------------------------

Large-scale commercial agriculture (primarily cattle ranching and cultivation of soya bean and oil palm) accounted for 40 percent of tropical deforestation between 2000 and 2010, and local subsistence agriculture for another 33 percent.

What causes trees to fall off during the Vietnam War?
-----------------------------------------------------

The construction of roads, dams, and other infrastructure. Military conflicts among humans can also result in deforestation. For example, the U.S. military made extensive use of Agent Orange (a defoliant that causes the leaves of trees to wither and fall off) during the Vietnam War (1955 – 1975).

How does the removal of trees affect the environment?
-----------------------------------------------------

The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in habitat damage, biodiversity loss, and aridity. It has adverse impacts on biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Deforestation has also been used in war to deprive the enemy of vital resources and cover for its forces.

How does the loss of forest cover affect the environment?
---------------------------------------------------------

Deforestation refers to the removal of forest cover where the land is thereafter converted to a non-forest use. The loss of the forest cover results change in the climatic condition and also affects the biodiversity which in turn threatens the life of the people.
