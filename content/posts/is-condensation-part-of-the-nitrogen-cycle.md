Is condensation part of the nitrogen cycle?
-------------------------------------------

A few of these type of bacteria return nitrogen to the atmosphere by a process called denitrification, however this amount is small. highest abundance. Water in the atmosphere condenses to form clouds.

Does the nitrogen cycle include water?
--------------------------------------

The nitrogen cycle is a repeating cycle of processes during which nitrogen moves through both living and non-living things: the atmosphere, soil, water, plants, animals and bacteria. In order to move through the different parts of the cycle, nitrogen must change forms.

Does the nitrogen cycle use precipitation?
------------------------------------------

Precipitation directly alters N cycling via its impact on soil water availability, erosion and leaching, and indirectly alters N cycling by influencing plant N uptake as well as plant productivity.

How are the water cycle and nitrogen cycle related?
---------------------------------------------------

When organisms die, decomposers in the ocean or soil break them down. Nitrogen in the soil or water is used again by living things. A small amount is returned to the atmosphere by certain bacteria that can break down nitrogen compounds into nitrogen gas. Show three ways in which water moves through the cycle.

What organisms run the nitrogen cycle?
--------------------------------------

Prokaryotes play several roles in the nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil and within the root nodules of some plants convert nitrogen gas in the atmosphere to ammonia. Nitrifying bacteria convert ammonia to nitrites or nitrates. Denitrifying bacteria converts nitrates back to nitrogen gas.

What does rain do in the nitrogen cycle?
----------------------------------------

Because rainwater contains nitrogen in forms that plants can absorb, and plants need nitrogen to grow, farmers have noticed that rainwater stimulates more plant growth than water from other sources. That’s good, in that farmers don’t need to apply as much artificial fertilizer.

What is the difference between nitrogen cycle and phosphorus cycle?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Nitrogen has a gaseous phase whereas phosphorus does not. The cycling of the phosphorus element in the form of nutrients in the environment is known as the phosphorus cycle. Moreover, both the nitrogen and the phosphorus cycles are types of biogeochemical cycles or nutrient cycles.

How does the nitrogen cycle work in plants?
-------------------------------------------

Non-legume plants absorb nitrates from the soil into their roots and use the nitrates to produce their proteins. 7. Denitrification This is when bacteria in the soil convert the nitrate back into nitrogen gas which then gets released back into the atmosphere.

What is the status of condensation in the water cycle?
------------------------------------------------------

Status: Completed. Condensation and the Water Cycle. The air is full of water, as water vapor, even if you can’t see it. Condensation is the process of water vapor turning back into liquid water, with the best example being those big, fluffy clouds floating over your head.

Which is a result of decomposition in the nitrogen cycle?
---------------------------------------------------------

Decomposition. Decomposers (some free-living bacteria and fungi) break down animal and plant proteins (from dead organisms) and nitrogenous waste products to release energy. As a result of decomposition nitrogen is released into the soil in the form of ammonium. 5. Nitrification.

How are bacteria involved in the nitrogen cycle?
------------------------------------------------

We’ll discuss each part of the process below. In the process of nitrogen fixation, bacteria turn nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into ammonia. These nitrogen-fixing bacteria, often called “diazotrophs,” have an enzyme called “nitrogenase” which combines nitrogen atoms with hydrogen atoms.
