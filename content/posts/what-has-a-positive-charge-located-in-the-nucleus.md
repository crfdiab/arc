What has a positive charge located in the nucleus?
--------------------------------------------------

protons  
Atomic Particles The nucleus (center) of the atom contains the protons (positively charged) and the neutrons (no charge). The outermost regions of the atom are called electron shells and contain the electrons (negatively charged).

What charges are inside the nucleus?
------------------------------------

The nucleus (center) of the atom contains the protons (positively charged) and the neutrons (no charge). The outermost regions of the atom are called electron shells and contain the electrons (negatively charged). Atoms have different properties based on the arrangement and number of their basic particles.

Does the nucleus has a positive charge?
---------------------------------------

Atoms are made up of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The nucleus is a collection of particles called protons, which are positively charged, and neutrons, which are electrically neutral.

Why the nucleus is very dense?
------------------------------

Size and Mass of the Nucleus Electrons have virtually no mass, but protons and neutrons have a lot of mass for their size. As a result, the nucleus has virtually all the mass of an atom. Given its great mass and tiny size, the nucleus is very dense.

Does the nucleus have mass?
---------------------------

The nucleus depicted above is now understood to be a quantum system composed of protons and neutrons, particles of nearly equal mass and the same intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of 1/2. The proton carries one unit of positive electric charge while the neutron has no electric charge.

What is an atom‚Äôs nucleus made of?
----------------------------------

The nucleus is the positively charged centre of an atom and contains most of its mass. It is composed of protons, which have a positive charge, and neutrons, which have no charge. Protons, neutrons, and the electrons surrounding them are long-lived particles present in all ordinary, naturally occurring atoms.

Which subatomic particle is the lightest?
-----------------------------------------

Electron  
Electron, lightest stable subatomic particle known. It carries a negative charge of 1.602176634 √ó 10‚àí19 coulomb, which is considered the basic unit of electric charge. The rest mass of the electron is 9.1093837015 √ó 10‚àí31 kg, which is only 1/1,836the mass of a proton.

Does the nucleus contain nearly all of the atom‚Äôs mass?
-------------------------------------------------------

The nucleus contains the majority of an atom‚Äôs mass because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy almost all of an atom‚Äôs volume.

What is nucleus mass?
---------------------

The mass of the nucleus is associated with the atomic mass number, which is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. The unit of measure for mass is the atomic mass unit (amu). One atomic mass unit is equal to 1.66 x 10-24 grams. Besides the standard kilogram, it is a second mass standard.

Why is the nucleus positive in charge?
--------------------------------------

The nucleus has an overall positive charge as it contains the protons. Every atom has no overall charge (neutral). This is because they contain equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons. These opposite charges cancel each other out making the atom neutral.

Why is the overall charge of the nucleus positive?
--------------------------------------------------

Which is the positively charged part of the nucleus?
----------------------------------------------------

In the nucleus, there are two types of subatomic particles. These are the neutrons, which have no charge either negative or positive, and protons, which have a positive charge. The positively charged part of the nucleus are the protons. üôÇ Hello!

Which is the positive part of an atom?
--------------------------------------

The proton is the positive charged part of an atom. It is also found inside the nucleus. The proton is found in every atom and will most likely be positively charged for all eternity.

Why do protons and neutrons fall around the nucleus?
----------------------------------------------------

The negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positively charged protons and fall around the nucleus, much like a satellite is attracted to the gravity of the Earth.

Why do electrons have the same charge as protons?
-------------------------------------------------

Electrons have an electric charge of ‚àí 1, which is equal but opposite to the charge of a proton, which is + 1. All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons, so the positive and negative charges ‚Äúcancel out‚Äù, making atoms electrically neutral.
