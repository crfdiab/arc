What is the movement of Eurasian Plate?
---------------------------------------

The Eurasian Plate also diverges away from the North American plate at a rate of about 3 centimeters per year. As a whole, the Eurasian plate moves about one-quarter to half an inch per year on average. At a size of 67,800,000 km2, it is third largest tectonic plate on Earth.

Which direction is the Eurasian Plate and North American Plate moving?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The explanation is that plates move in a rotational manner. The North American Plate, for example, rotates counter-clockwise; the Eurasian Plate rotates clockwise. Boundaries between the plates are of three types: divergent (i.e., moving apart), convergent (i.e., moving together), and transform (moving side by side).

What direction are the tectonic plates moving?
----------------------------------------------

The Pacific Plate is moving to the northwest at a speed of between 7 and 11 centimeters (cm) or ~3-4 inches a year. The North American plate is moving to the west-southwest at about 2.3 cm (~1 inch) per year driven by the spreading center that created the Atlantic Ocean, the Mid Atlantic Ridge.

How fast is the Eurasian Plate moving?
--------------------------------------

about 3cm per year  
The Eurasian Plate is moving away from the North American Plate at a rate the is about 3cm per year. That is about the same rate at which your fingernails will grow.

What causes the Eurasian Plate to move?
---------------------------------------

The collision of India into Asia 50 million years ago caused the Indian and Eurasian Plates to crumple up along the collision zone. After the collision, the slow continuous convergence of these two plates over millions of years pushed up the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau to their present heights.

Can two plates move in the same direction?
------------------------------------------

Part of Hall of Planet Earth. When oceanic or continental plates slide past each other in opposite directions, or move in the same direction but at different speeds, a transform fault boundary is formed.

How fast do plates move?
------------------------

They move at a rate of one to two inches (three to five centimeters) per year.

How do we know the plates are still moving?
-------------------------------------------

Long term relative motion between plates can be inferred by matching geology between continents that can thus be deduced to have once been connected. This approach was used by geologists in the early 20th century. That plates are moving today can be demonstrated from earthquakes.

Is the Eurasian Plate growing?
------------------------------

The Himalayas continue to rise more than 1 cm a year — a growth rate of 10 km in a million years! If that is so, why aren’t the Himalayas even higher? Scientists believe that the Eurasian Plate may now be stretching out rather than thrusting up, and such stretching would result in some subsidence due to gravity.

How many millimeters does the Eurasian Plate move?
--------------------------------------------------

The Eurasian Plate is moving in a southern direction and grinding into the Indian Plate. The Eurasian plate is moving at 7 – 14 millimeters per year… See full answer below.

What makes up the south side of the Eurasian Plate?
---------------------------------------------------

This plate is sandwiched between the North American and African Plate on the north and west sides. The west side shares a divergent plate boundary with the North American plate. The south side of the Eurasian plate neighbors the Arabian, Indian and Sunda plates.

What kind of tectonic plate is the Eurasian Plate?
--------------------------------------------------

The Eurasian Plate is a tectonic plate which includes most of the continent of Eurasia (a landmass consisting of the traditional continents of Europe and Asia), with the notable exceptions of the Indian subcontinent, the Arabian subcontinent, and the area east of the Chersky Range in East Siberia.

Where does the North American and Pacific plates move?
------------------------------------------------------

Lastly, the San Andreas fault is between the North American Plate and Pacific Plate are transform plate boundaries. While the North American plate in the east moves in the southwest direction, the Pacific plate in the west moves northwest.
