What British ships fought the Bismarck?
---------------------------------------

Allied

- The British battleships King George V and Rodney.
- The British aircraft carrier Ark Royal.
- The British heavy cruisers Norfolk and Dorsetshire.
- The British light cruiser Sheffield.
- The British destroyers Cossack, Sikh, Zulu, Maori, Mashona, Tartar.
- The Polish destroyer ORP Piorun. What were the two Bismarck class battleships?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    Work was completed in August 1940, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Bismarck and her sister ship Tirpitz were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the largest built by any European power.
    
    How did the British find the Bismarck?
    --------------------------------------
    
    On May 27, 1941, the British navy sinks the German battleship Bismarck in the North Atlantic near France. On May 24, the British battle cruiser Hood and battleship Prince of Wales intercepted it near Iceland. In a ferocious battle, the Hood exploded and sank, and all but three of the 1,421 crewmen were killed.
    
    What ship spotted the Bismarck?
    -------------------------------
    
    At 10:25 a.m. on May 26, a Catalina flying boat spotted Bismarck from the air, 31 hours after the British had lost contact. The big battleship was some 700 miles from France. The only force with any hope of stopping her were the open-cockpit Swordfish torpedo bombers on Ark Royal.
    
    How far could the Bismarck Fire?
    --------------------------------
    
    The 15 cm guns fired a 45.3 kg (100 lb) shell at a muzzle velocity of 875 m/s (2,871 ft/s). At maximum elevation, the guns could hit targets out to 23,000 m (25,000 yd). As with the main battery guns, Tirpitz’s 15 cm guns were later supplied with time-fused shells.
    
    Who was captain of Bismarck?
    ----------------------------
    
    Johann Günther Lütjens  
    Johann Günther Lütjens (25 May 1889 – 27 May 1941) was a German admiral whose military service spanned more than thirty years and two world wars. Lütjens is best known for his actions during World War II and his command of the battleship Bismarck during its foray into the Atlantic Ocean in 1941.
    
    Did Ark Royal sunk the Bismarck?
    --------------------------------
    
    The striking force appears in the scene of the battle at about 1015, but due to the heavy fire from the British warships stays away. The Bismarck finally sinks at 1040. 29 May 1941: Ark Royal arrives at Gibraltar to resume her operations with Force H in the Mediterranean.
    
    Who sank the Musashi?
    ---------------------
    
    During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Musashi was sunk by an estimated 19 torpedo and 17 bomb hits from American carrier-based aircraft on 24 October 1944. Over half of her crew was rescued. Her wreck was located in March 2015 by a team of researchers employed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.
    
    How did the British find the German battleship Bismarck?
    --------------------------------------------------------
    
    This allowed the British to triangulate the approximate position of Bismarck and aircraft were dispatched to hunt for the German battleship. She was rediscovered in the late morning of 26 May by a Catalina flying boat from No. 209 Squadron RAF and subsequently shadowed by aircraft from Force H steaming north from Gibraltar.
    
    How did the British lose contact with the Bismarck?
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    Early on 25 May the British forces lost contact with Bismarck, which headed ESE towards France while the British searched NE, presuming she was returning to Norway. Later on 25 May Admiral Lütjens, apparently unaware that he had lost his pursuers, broke radio silence to send a coded message to Germany.
    
    What was the purpose of the Furst Bismarck?
    -------------------------------------------
    
    The first armored cruiser to be designed by the German navy, Fürst Bismarck was an enlarged version of the Victoria Louise-class cruisers, at nearly twice the displacement and with a significantly more powerful armament. The ship was intended for overseas use, particularly in support of German colonies in Asia and the Pacific.
    
    Why did Bismarck lose the battle with hood and Prince of Wales?
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    
    And when, as a result of the battle with Hood and Prince of Wales, Bismarck lost access to several thousand tons of fuel in her forecastle due to a shell hit from Prince of Wales (aft of the forecastle, in her anchor locker), Lütjens had to order his ships to slow down to conserve fuel.
