Do turtles need moonlight?
--------------------------

Sea turtle hatchlings have an inborn tendency to move in the brightest direction. This sea-finding behavior can take place during any phase and position of the moon, which indicates that hatchlings do not depend on lunar light to lead them seaward.

How do turtles use the moon?
----------------------------

After 55-60 days, the hatchlings emerge from their nests — also at night. When making their way back to the ocean, sea turtles use the light of the Moon and stars to navigate. Sea turtles use the light of the Moon and stars to navigate. Turn off the lights, draw the shades and use LED or “turtle-friendly” lighting.

What is the biggest threat to sea turtles?
------------------------------------------

Incidental capture by fishing gear is the greatest threat to most sea turtles, especially endangered loggerheads, greens, and leatherbacks. This threat is increasing as fishing activity expands.

Do turtles nest at high or low tide?
------------------------------------

Solar, lunar and tidal cycles are believed to influence leatherback nesting activities because the turtles generally nest above the high tide line (Kamel &amp; Mrosovsky 2004), so emerging when tides are at their highest will minimise the distance and duration of crawls.

Do turtles lay eggs on full moon?
---------------------------------

The question we often get is, “do sea turtles come out during a full moon?” The short answer is they nest and emerge from nests during all moon phases.

What is turtle friendly lighting?
---------------------------------

Turtle-friendly lighting is lighting specifically designed to minimize the ecological impact that traditional lighting can have on turtles and wildlife, especially near oceans and beaches. Lighting must be set to a certain (amber) wavelength, must be shielded and kept low to the ground and low-wattage.

Do turtles lay eggs in full moon?
---------------------------------

What kills sea turtles the most?
--------------------------------

Pollution: Plastics, discarded fishing gear, petroleum by-products, and other debris harm and kill sea turtles through ingestion and entanglement. Light pollution disrupts nesting behavior and causes hatchling death by leading them away from the sea.

Why do turtles return to the same beach?
----------------------------------------

Marine turtles almost always return to the same beach to lay their eggs. The egg-laying sites are often far from the feeding areas and the females cross several hundred kilometers of ocean with no visual landmarks.

Do you see sea turtles during the full moon?
--------------------------------------------

Human nature, however, seems to be attracted to them. People have ascribed all sorts of things to the full moon with very little scientific support (1). The question we often get is, “do sea turtles come out during a full moon?” The short answer is they nest and emerge from nests during all moon phases.

What kind of turtles nest during the Moon?
------------------------------------------

The short answer is they nest and emerge from nests during all moon phases. Higher nesting in olive ridleys and some loggerhead populations has been correlated to the moon phase, but for the most part factors that affect nesting are unrelated to the moon (2). However, hatchling orientation can be affected by a new moon.

How does the full moon affect marine animals?
---------------------------------------------

Marine animals, however, often react more to the opportunities associated with changes in tides. Some species of sea turtles, for example, wait for the full moon’s high tide to ride waves onto shore and lay their eggs far up on the beach.

When do sea turtles come out of their nests?
--------------------------------------------

The question we often get is, “do sea turtles come out during a full moon?” The short answer is they nest and emerge from nests during all moon phases. Higher nesting in olive ridleys and some loggerhead populations has been correlated to the moon phase, but for the most part factors that affect nesting are unrelated to the moon (2).
