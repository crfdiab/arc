How many square kilometers are in a 5km radius?
-----------------------------------------------

78.54 square kilometers (km²)

What is the area of 5.2 km?
---------------------------

A circle of radius = 0.8276 or diameter = 1.655 or circumference = 5.2 km has an area of: 2.152 square kilometers (km²) 2.152 × 106 square meters (m²)

How do you find area from radius?
---------------------------------

The area of a circle is pi times the radius squared (A = π r²).

What is the area of 12 km?
--------------------------

A circle of radius = 1.91 or diameter = 3.82 or circumference = 12 km has an area of: 11.46 square kilometers (km²) 1.146 × 107 square meters (m²)

How big is a 300 meter radius?
------------------------------

The diameter of a circle is the distance from one edge to the other, passing through the center. It is twice the radius….Diameter of a Circle.

How do you convert diameter to area in square meters?
-----------------------------------------------------

Formula

1. A = Circle area.
2. π = Pi = 3.14159…
3. ø = Circle diameter.

What is the area of the radius is 3?
------------------------------------

A circle of radius = 3 or diameter = 6 or circumference = 18.85 meters has an area of: 2.827E-5 square kilometers (km²) 28.27 square meters (m²)

What is the area of a 40 cm circle?
-----------------------------------

194.835 square inches (in²)

What is area formula?
---------------------

Given a rectangle with length l and width w, the formula for the area is: A = lw (rectangle). That is, the area of the rectangle is the length multiplied by the width. As a special case, as l = w in the case of a square, the area of a square with side length s is given by the formula: A = s2 (square).

How many football fields is 300 meters?
---------------------------------------

300 Meters (m) = 984.25197 Feet (ft) Meters : The meter (symbol m) is the fundamental unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). The answer is 91.44.

What is 300m tall?
------------------

| Citations. It’s about nine-tenths as tall as The Eiffel Tower. In other words, 300 meters is 0.926 times the height of The Eiffel Tower, and the height of The Eiffel Tower is 1.1 times that amount.

How is the radius of a circle related to its area?
--------------------------------------------------

This distance from the center to any point on the circle is called the radius. More detail can be found regarding circles on the Circle Calculator page, but to calculate the area it is only necessary to know the radius, and understand that values in a circle are related through the mathematical constant π.

How to calculate the area of a quadrilateral?
---------------------------------------------

It is one of the simplest shapes, and calculating its area only requires that its length and width are known (or can be measured). A quadrilateral by definition is a polygon that has four edges and vertices.

How to calculate the area of a piece of land?
---------------------------------------------

area = length × width. The Farmer and his Daughter – Unsold Land. Imagine a farmer trying to sell a piece of land that happens to be perfectly rectangular. Because he owns some cows that he did not want frolicking freely, he fenced the piece of land and knows the exact length and width of each edge.

How to calculate the area of a shape?
-------------------------------------

The following are calculators to evaluate the area of seven common shapes. The area of more complex shapes can usually be obtained by breaking them down into their aggregate simple shapes, and totaling their areas. This calculator is especially useful for estimating land area.
