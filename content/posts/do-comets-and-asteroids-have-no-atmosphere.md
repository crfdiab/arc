Do comets and asteroids have no atmosphere?
-------------------------------------------

Asteroids have no atmosphere, but many are large enough to exert a gravitational pull — some, in fact, have one or two companion moons, or they form binary systems, in which two similarly sized asteroids orbit each other.

Do comets and asteroids have atmospheres?
-----------------------------------------

Asteroid: A relatively small, inactive, rocky body orbiting the Sun. Comet: A relatively small, at times active, object whose ices can vaporize in sunlight forming an atmosphere (coma) of dust and gas and, sometimes, a tail of dust and/or gas.

What is the relationship between comets and asteroids?
------------------------------------------------------

Asteroids are made up of metals and rocky material, while comets are made up of ice, dust and rocky material. Both asteroids and comets were formed early in the history of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. Asteroids formed much closer to the Sun, where it was too warm for ices to remain solid.

What are some facts about comets and asteroids?
-----------------------------------------------

Some are only a few feet in size, while others are a mile or more long.

- Comets are mostly made of ice. They are very old.
- Asteroids are mostly made of rock.
- Sometimes asteroids collide or crash into one another.
- Scientists believe an asteroid might have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Which is bigger comet asteroid or meteor?
    -----------------------------------------
    
    Asteroids are smaller than a planet, but they are larger than the pebble-size objects we call meteoroids. A meteor is what happens when a meteoroid – a small piece of an asteroid or comet – burns up upon entering Earth’s atmosphere, creating a streak of light in the sky.
    
    Which is bigger an asteroid or a comet?
    ---------------------------------------
    
    These are much larger than comets. An asteroid only 5 km across would be classi- fied as small; Ceres, the largest, is 100 times bigger than this. They show no coma activity and the reflectance spectrum is similar to that of asteroids. They are bigger than standard comets but smaller than a typical asteroid.
    
    How many asteroids hit Earth each year?
    ---------------------------------------
    
    Every year, the Earth is hit by about 6100 meteors large enough to reach the ground, or about 17 every day, research has revealed. The vast majority fall unnoticed, in uninhabited areas. But several times a year, a few land in places that catch more attention.

    What is a comet vs meteor?
    --------------------------
    
    Comet: A body of ice, rock and dust that can be several miles in diameter and orbits the sun. Debris from comets is the source of many meteoroids. Meteoroid: A small rocky or metal object, usually between the size of a grain of sand or a boulder, that orbits the sun. It originates from a comet or asteroid.
    
    Are comets found in the asteroid belt?
    --------------------------------------
    
    Today, most asteroids orbit the sun in a tightly packed belt located between Mars and Jupiter. Comets are relegated to either a cloud or belt on the solar system fringe.
    
    What is the origin of comets?
    -----------------------------
    
    Where Do Comets Come From? It is thought that most comets originate in a vast cloud of ice and dust that surrounds the solar system. A star passing near the solar system may have disturbed the motions of some comets in the Oort Cloud, sending them into the solar system.
    
    How are asteroids surrounded by a hydrogen cloud?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    A comet is surrounded by various vaporized ices, but not hydrogen. Where does asteroids originated? The asteroids in our solar system originated billions of years ago. When the Sun first formed, it was surrounded by a cloud of debris.
    
    What kind of atmosphere does a comet have?
    ------------------------------------------
    
    Comets surrounded by a hydrogen cloud comets orbit the sun comets, asteroids have no atmosphere asteroids, meteors ceres is the largest asteroids no tail asteroids, meteors highly elliptical orbit comets orbit between mars and jupiter asteroids have a long gas tail comets
    
    How are asteroids and comets the same thing?
    --------------------------------------------
    
    Asteroids and comets are not the same thing. While asteroids come from the asteroid best, most comets come from the Oort Cloud or Kuiper Best, far beyond Neptune. They are also made up differently – comets being ice and dust, while asteroids are rock. What are unchanged fragments from the early period of the planet building in the solar system?
    
    What kind of rock are asteroids made of?
    ----------------------------------------
    
    Known as planetoids asteroids Made of rock or iron/metal asteroids, meteors Long dust tail Comets surrounded by a hydrogen cloud comets orbit the sun comets, asteroids have no atmosphere asteroids, meteors ceres is the largest asteroids no tail asteroids, meteors highly elliptical orbit comets orbit between mars and jupiter asteroids
