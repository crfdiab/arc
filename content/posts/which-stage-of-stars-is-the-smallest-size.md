Which stage of stars is the smallest size?
------------------------------------------

White dwarfs are the smallest type stars, with a similar size to earth, and with extreme mass. The mass of these stars can be equal to that of the sun. Brown dwarfs are strange altogether.

What are the stages of a small star?
------------------------------------

All stars, irrespective of their size, follow the same 7 stage cycle, they start as a gas cloud and end as a star remnant.

- Giant Gas Cloud. A star originates from a large cloud of gas.
- Protostar.
- T-Tauri Phase.
- Main Sequence.
- Red Giant.
- The Fusion of Heavier Elements.
- Supernovae and Planetary Nebulae. What is the first stage of a small star?
    ----------------------------------------
    
    Stage 1- Stars are born in a region of high density Nebula, and condenses into a huge globule of gas and dust and contracts under its own gravity. This image shows the Orion Nebula or M42 . Stage 2 – A region of condensing matter will begin to heat up and start to glow forming Protostars.
    
    How do small stars die?
    -----------------------
    
    Most stars take millions of years to die. When a star like the Sun has burned all of its hydrogen fuel, it expands to become a red giant. After puffing off its outer layers, the star collapses to form a very dense white dwarf. …
    
    What is star death called?
    --------------------------
    
    supernova  
    While most stars quietly fade away, the supergiants destroy themselves in a huge explosion, called a supernova. The death of massive stars can trigger the birth of other stars.
    
    Will all the stars die?
    -----------------------
    
    100 billion years from now: All sun-like stars are dead Its nuclear fuel will get depleted in five billion years from now. At that point it’ll become a fading and dying white dwarf, incapable of nuclear fusion and hosting life on planets around it.
    
    What are the 6 stages of how a star forms?
    ------------------------------------------
    
    Described below are the 6 stages of how a star of about one Solar Mass forms. Explanation: Stage 1 – Giant molecular cloud: A star begins life as a large cloud of gas. A region of high density within this cloud condenses into a huge globule of gas and dust and contracts under its own gravity.
    
    Which is the last stage of a star’s life?
    -----------------------------------------
    
    By this time the star and entered into a state called the Main Sequence Star which last for approximately 10 billion years. Stage Four: The hydrogen begins to run out and the stars grows into a red giant.
    
    When does a star become a main sequence star?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    After that, the star becomes a Main Sequence star. Also, it spends 90% of its life in this stage fusing with hydrogen molecule and forming helium. Most noteworthy, the sun is currently in this stage. 5. Expansion into Red Giant
    
    Which is the third phase of a star?
    -----------------------------------
    
    3\. T-Tauri Phase. A T-Tauri star begins when materials stop falling into the Protostar and release tremendous amounts of energy. The mean temperature of the Tauri star isn’t enough to support nuclear fusion at its core.
