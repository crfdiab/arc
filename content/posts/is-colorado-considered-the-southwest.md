    -----------------------------------------
    
    Data collected Sept. 2020 based on more than 100 fares across more than a dozen major U.S. airports. American Airlines still came out just 0.06% more expensive than Southwest overall, but Southwest was 10% cheaper than United and an even more striking 26% cheaper than Delta.

    -----------------------------------
    
    Southwest isn’t always the cheapest, but they’re typically cheaper than Delta. You want to avoid the hassle of flying through a massive airline hub. Southwest is largely a point-to-point carrier, meaning that there’s less of a chance of having to change planes at a major hub.
