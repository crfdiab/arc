Are old buildings earthquake proof?
-----------------------------------

A new study in this tiny European country reveals that buildings constructed during the Middle Ages ride out earthquakes better than those built to modern standards. The reason for this counterintuitive truth appears to be that old buildings were constructed so that the floor doesn’t attach to the walls.

Is it safe to build a house near a fault line explain your answer?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Phivolcs now recommends avoiding construction within 5 meters on each side of a fault trace, or a total width of 10 meters. We may call this the ideal “10-meter wide no-build zone” in the vicinity of a fault. Ideally, we should not build in the 10-meter wide no-build zone to avoid the hazard of ground fissure.

Should buildings be earthquake proof?
-------------------------------------

To withstand collapse, buildings need to redistribute the forces that travel through them during a seismic event. Shear walls, cross braces, diaphragms, and moment-resisting frames are central to reinforcing a building. Shear walls are a useful building technology that helps to transfer earthquake forces.

How far from house is safe from fault?
--------------------------------------

But first, what is considered a safe distance from a fault line? PhiVolcs recommends avoiding construction within five meters on each side of a fault trace. This is equivalent to a total width of 10 meters. This is considered the ideal “10-meter wide no-build zone” in the vicinity of a fault.

How dangerous is a fault line?
------------------------------

The danger of living near fault lines Living near fault lines is inherently dangerous but difficult to avoid. The dangers people face include not only tremors but also other threats: Widespread smoke and ash can pollute the air and block out the sun for miles in every direction.

What do structural engineers need to know about earthquakes?
------------------------------------------------------------

When planning the seismic safety of a building, structural engineers must design the support elements of shorter buildings to withstand greater forces than those of taller buildings. When the quake hits Jell-O San Francisco, watch how the different buildings shake.

What do you need to know about earthquake building codes?
---------------------------------------------------------

Timeline of changes to building standards: 1 Taishin – the basic earthquake resistance required by law. Beams, pillars and walls are thicker to provide more strength against earthquakes. 2 Seishin – vibration control. 3 Menshin – base isolation system. 4 Falsification of structural earthquake resistance data:

How big of an earthquake can be caused by a near fault?
-------------------------------------------------------

As much as double, or about 0.8G, is considered by the building code for near-fault zones. We must note, however, that higher accelerations may still be produced by the maximum credible earthquakes from inland faults such as the West Valley Fault or the Philippine Fault System.

What happens to the ground below a building during an earthquake?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

So, the ground below a structure can be as important a safety consideration as its construction. Bedrock absorbs more wave energy than sandy soils or landfill, so buildings on solid rock will be much less affected than those built on softer soils. And if softer soils have water in them, they can become a little like quicksand during an earthquake.
