What is the smallest earthquake or tremor that follows a large earthquake?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aftershocks are smaller earthquakes that occur in the same general area during the days to years following a larger event or “mainshock”. They mostly occur within 1-2 fault lengths of the mainshock.

What is a smaller earthquake that follows a larger earthquake quizlet?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a smaller earthquake or tremor that follows a large earthquake? Aftershocks.

What is the common new construction method that uses isolators to protect buildings during an earthquake?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Base isolation  
Base isolation involves constructing a building on top of flexible pads made of steel, rubber, and lead. When the base moves during the earthquake, the isolators vibrate while the structure itself remains steady. This effectively helps to absorb seismic waves and prevent them from traveling through a building.

What is the location on the Earth’s surface directly above the point where an earthquake begins quizlet?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An earthquake’s focus is located along a fault beneath Earth’s surface. The focus is the point within Earth where an earthquake starts. The epicenter is the location on the surface directly above the focus.

What produces the largest number of great earthquakes?
------------------------------------------------------

Spreading ridges produce the largest number of great earthquakes (magnitude 8 or higher).

Why does the earth shake when there is an earthquake quizlet?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the form of seismic waves like ripples on a pond. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth’s surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us!

What’s the difference between an aftershock and a new earthquake?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Aftershocks can continue over a period of weeks, months, or even years. However, as the word “new” suggests, a new earthquake has its epicenter at a different location or attributable to a different rupture/ failure/ origin mechanism than the aftershock sequence of a preceding mainshock.

Which is not a cause of an earthquake?
--------------------------------------

Which of the following is NOT a cause of an earthquake? Q. What is a break in the lithosphere along which movement in an earthquake has first occurred? Q.

Where does the first movement in an earthquake occur?
-----------------------------------------------------

Q. What is a break in the lithosphere along which movement in an earthquake has first occurred? Q. Where is the point at which the first movement occurs during an earthquake?

Which is the measure of the amount of energy released in an earthquake?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(This piece of equipment can measure the magnitude of an earthquake.) Q. What is the measure of the amount of energy released in an earthquake? Q. Which scale rates earthquakes based on the amount of damage done?
