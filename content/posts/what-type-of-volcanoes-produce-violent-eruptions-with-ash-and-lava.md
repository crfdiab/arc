What type of volcanoes produce violent eruptions with ash and lava?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Phreatic eruptions pulverise surrounding rocks and can produce ash, but do not include new magma. An eruption resulting from the interaction of new magma or lava with water and can be very explosive. The water can be from groundwater, hydrothermal systems, surface runoff, a lake or the sea.

What type of volcano has violent eruptions?
-------------------------------------------

stratovolcanoes  
Because they form in a system of underground conduits, stratovolcanoes may blow out the sides of the cone as well as the summit crater. Stratovolcanoes are considered the most violent.

What type of volcano has explosive volcanic ash?
------------------------------------------------

Composite volcanoes  
Composite volcanoes are tall, steep cones that produce explosive eruptions. Shield volcanoes form very large, gently sloped mounds from effusive eruptions. Cinder cones are the smallest volcanoes and result from accumulation of many small fragments of ejected material.

How are the different types of volcanoes different?
---------------------------------------------------

These types of volcanoes are tall conical mountains composed of lava flows and other ejecta in alternate layers, the strata that give rise to the name. Composite volcanoes are made of cinders, ash, and lava. Cinders and ash pile on top of each other, lava flows on top of the ash, where it cools and hardens, and then the process repeats.

Which is the least violent type of volcanic eruption?
-----------------------------------------------------

They can range in volume from a few cubic metres to cubic kilometres. These are the least violent types of explosive eruptions. Hawaiian eruptions have fire fountains and lava flows, whereas Strombolian eruptions have explosions causing a shower of lava fragments.

Which is the most common type of volcanic cone?
-----------------------------------------------

Cinder cone s, sometimes called scoria cone s or pyroclastic cone s, are the most common types of volcanic cones. They form after violent eruptions blow lava fragments into the air, which then solidify and fall as cinder s around the volcanic vent.

What kind of hazards can be produced by a volcano?
