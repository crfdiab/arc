Why did the denisovans die out?
-------------------------------

By 10,000 years ago, they were all gone. The disappearance of these species resembles a mass extinction. But there’s no obvious environmental catastrophe — volcanic eruptions, climate change, asteroid impact — driving it.

How did the Neanderthals die off?
---------------------------------

We once lived alongside Neanderthals, but interbreeding, climate change, or violent clashes with rival Homo sapiens led to their demise. Until around 100,000 years ago, Europe was dominated by the Neanderthals.

Did Homosapien and Neanderthal mate?
------------------------------------

New research shows modern humans bred with Neanderthals 47,000 to 65,000 years ago as our ancestors left Africa. Two years ago the analysis of the Neanderthal genome revealed modern humans carry Neanderthal DNA, implying our ancestors mated with Neanderthals at some point in the past.

How many years did a Neanderthal live?
--------------------------------------

Neanderthals typically lived to be about 30 years old, though some lived longer. It is accepted that Neanderthals buried their dead, though whether or not they left carved bone shards as grave goods is debated.

What race has the most Neanderthal DNA?
---------------------------------------

East Asians seem to have the most Neanderthal DNA in their genomes, followed by those of European ancestry. Africans, long thought to have no Neanderthal DNA, were recently found to have genes from the hominins comprising around 0.3 percent of their genome.

Did Neanderthals speak?
-----------------------

Its similarity to those of modern humans was seen as evidence by some scientists that Neanderthals possessed a modern vocal tract and were therefore capable of fully modern speech.

When was the Netherlands neutral in World War 1?
------------------------------------------------

In 2014, Klinkert, Kruizinga and Moeyes published a new book on Dutch neutrality during the First World War, the topic to which this article will now turn. In August 1914 the Netherlands had been a neutral country for more than sixty years.

When did the Germans take over the Netherlands?
-----------------------------------------------

The German occupation of the Netherlands began after five days of fighting in May 1940. Bombers of the Luftwaffe had dropped their deadly payloads on Rotterdam during the Rotterdam Blitz, killing almost 1,000 of the city’s civilians and destroying tens of thousands of homes.

Why was the First World War never written about in the Netherlands?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The First World War has never had a major place in Dutch historiography. Dutch neutrality and the overwhelming influence of the Second World War on the country may explain this state of affairs. Moreover, the studies that were written were in Dutch, so their international impact remained limited.

When did the Eighty Years War end in the Netherlands?
-----------------------------------------------------

1648 – The Eighty Years’ War comes to an end with the Peace of Munster. The Dutch Republic is recognized by Spain as an independent country. 1652 – The Dutch go to war against the English. 1688 – King William of Orange and Queen Mary become rulers. 1795 – The French army invades and takes over. The Batavian Republic is declared.
