Why does it rain in summer?
---------------------------

Showers in late afternoons during summer is due to convection. During summer as land mass gets heated up, warm air rises up and pulls up moisture from the water bodies on earth surface. As the warm air rises it starts to cool down into cumulonimbus clouds.

Why does it rain so much in tropical areas?
-------------------------------------------

Heat, Moisture, Clouds and Rain As the sun shines strongly on the tropics — particularly on the warm oceans which have an effectively infinite amount of water to evaporate into the air — the overlying atmosphere becomes very humid. If enough water condenses, the cloud droplets can become large enough to fall as rain.

Why does the temperature rise before it rains?
----------------------------------------------

The temperature rise your feeling is the warm humid air rolling into your cooler area before it rains. Your body cools itself by sweat evaporating which disperses your heat into the surrounding atmosphere. If the air is humid the sweat cannot evaporate and you retain heat and feel hot. Rainfall has a cooling effect.

What happens in countries with the highest rainfall?
----------------------------------------------------

If some parts of the world are dealing with drought and lack of rains, countries with the highest rainfall have the opposite problem – recurrent flooding. Rain has lots of benefits as water is needed by all crops, without which we wouldn’t be able to sustain or grow our population.

Where does the rain on the Earth come from?
-------------------------------------------

For starters, rain is liquid precipitation, as opposed to non-liquid kinds (such as snow, hail and sleet). It begins with the vaporization of water near the Earth’s surface, in the form of rivers, lakes, oceans or ground water, provided there are atmospheric temperatures above melting point of water (0°C).

Is it possible to rain hot water in the atmosphere?
---------------------------------------------------

Originally Answered: Is it possible to rain hot water? Not really, rain temperature is influenced by air temperature, with some cooling from evaporation. In the section of the atmosphere where rain clouds form (Troposphere) the trend is for cooling the higher you go.
