How was farming in the New England colonies?
--------------------------------------------

The soil was rocky, which made farming difficult. The New England colonies had very harsh winters and mild summers. Because the soil was rocky and the climate was often harsh, colonists in New England only farmed enough to feed their families. Some of these crops included corn, beans, and squash.

How was agriculture and the economy in New England different from that in the South?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The soil in the region was too rocky for large-scale farming like that found in the Mid-Atlantic and Southern colonies, so the New England colonists made use of the resources that their environment offered. The Southern Colonies specialized primarily in cash crops.

What was farming like in the southern colonies?
-----------------------------------------------

The southern colonies were made up of mostly coastal plains and piedmont areas. The soil was good for farming and the climate was warm, including hot summers and mild winters. The cash crops of the southern colonies included cotton, tobacco, rice, and indigo (a plant that was used to create blue dye).

How did farming differ in the New England colonies?
---------------------------------------------------

Farming in colonial differed in many ways from farming today. The most significant difference was in what crops were grown where. Farmers in the New England Colonies had a rough time of it. Much of the soil wasnâ€™t good for growing crops, especially near the ocean.

Why was farming important to the southern colonies?
---------------------------------------------------

All of these were cash crops, sold for money. The crops were usually exported from the colony. The production of these corps required large numbers of workers. As a result, the plantations in the south relied on slaves to do much of the work on their farms.

How are the New England southern and middle colonies similar?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The colonies were located in three different geographical areas. They were New England, Southern, and Middle colonies. The colonies had similarities and differences in terms of culture, religion, and economy. The colonialists had different reasons for settling in America, but the main reason was for economic empowerment.

Where did the Puritans and pilgrims settle in New England?
----------------------------------------------------------

Puritans and pilgrims settled in the New England colonies. They were the early settlers of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire. The climatic conditions were the coldest in the New England colonies as they were further north than the other colonies.
