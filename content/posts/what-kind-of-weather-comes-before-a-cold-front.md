What type of rain will you have with a cold front?
--------------------------------------------------

Development of cold fronts

<table><tr><th>Weather phenomenon</th><th>Prior to the passing of the front</th></tr><tr><td>Precipitation/conditions\*</td><td>Light patchy rain can be produced by stratocumulus or stratus in the warm sector. In summer, sometimes thunderstorms if a preceding squall line is present. In winter snow squalls or showers may occur.</td></tr></table>

Does a cold front bring good weather?
-------------------------------------

Cold fronts usually bring cooler weather, clearing skies, and a sharp change in wind direction.

What happens when a cold front passes through?
----------------------------------------------

Cold weather fronts usually move from northwest to southeast. The air behind a cold front is colder and drier than the air in front. When a cold front passes through, temperatures can drop more than 15 degrees within an hour. When a warm front passes, the air becomes noticeably warmer and more humid than it was before.

What happens to pressure during a cold front?
---------------------------------------------

Air pressure usually falls as a cold front approaches, rising rapidly after passage as the dense cold air moves in. The dew point falls indicating the change to a dry air mass.

What does a cold front look like on a weather map?
--------------------------------------------------

A cold front marks the leading edge of a mass of air that is cooler than the air in front of it. Meteorologists generally note a cold front as a blue line with triangles pointing in the direction of the advancing cool air on a weather map. Since cool air is more dense than warm air, the advancing cool air lifts the warm air out of the way.

What are the different types of weather fronts?
-----------------------------------------------

1 Cold Fronts. Cold fronts are cold, dense air masses that encounter warm, light air masses, pushing the warm air up into the atmosphere. 2 Warm Fronts. When a faster-moving warm front encounters a slower cold front, the warm air pushes up and over the colder air, because it’s less dense. 3 Stationary Fronts. 4 Occluded Fronts. …

Why are thunderstorms common along cold fronts?
-----------------------------------------------

Thunderstorms are common along cold fronts. This is because when a cold front occurs from a cold air mass moving into a warm air mass, the warm air is forced upward. When warm air rises, it cools, and since cool air can’t hold as much moisture as warm air, the water in the air gets forced out, which is what creates clouds.

What are the effects of a cold front?
-------------------------------------

Cold fronts are generally associated with heavy precipitation and stormy atmospheric conditions. Extreme weather conditions such as hail and lightning often accompany the arrival of a cold front. The air behind a cold front is much denser than the region of warmer air it is moving into.
