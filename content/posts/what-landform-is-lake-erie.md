What landform is Lake Erie?
---------------------------

The Erie Plain is a lacustrine plain consisting largely of sediment laid down by a series of proglacial lakes. These existed in the late Pleistocene Epoch, about 25,000 years ago to about 11,700 years ago, and were created by glaciers of the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age).

How many basins does Lake Erie have?
------------------------------------

three basins  
The lake is naturally divided into three basins that virtually function as three separate lakes: The western basin is very shallow, with an average depth of 7.4 metres (24 ft) and a maximum depth of 19 metres (62 ft).

What landform are the Great Lakes?
----------------------------------

Waves on large bodies of water such as the Great Lakes shape shores of loose material, building sand barriers (including spits), as well as beaches with scarps, berms, and beach ridges. Storm waves can attack weak bedrock that fringes lakeshores, undercutting these rock formations and creating cliffs.

How big is Lake Erie in square miles?
-------------------------------------

The lake has a maximum length of 241 miles (388 km), a maximum width of 57 miles (92 km), and a total surface area of 9,910 square miles (25,667 sq km). It’s also located at an elevation of 569 feet (173 meters) and has a total shoreline of 799 miles (1,286 km), excluding 72 miles (116 km) shoreline of its islands.

How many islands are there in Lake Erie?
----------------------------------------

Lake Erie Islands tend to be located in the western side of the lake and total 31 in number (13 in Canada, 18 in the U.S.). The island-village of Put-in-Bay on South Bass Island is a major tourism attraction.

What was the water level in Lake Erie in 2003?
----------------------------------------------

During one storm in November 2003, the water level at Buffalo rose by 7 feet (2.1 m) with waves of 10–15 feet (3.0–4.6 metres) for a rise of 22 feet (6.7 m). Meanwhile, at the western end of the lake, Toledo experienced a similar drop in water level.

What are the major tributaries of Lake Erie?
--------------------------------------------

Navigation downstream is provided by the Welland Canal, part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Other major contributors to Lake Erie include the Grand River, the Huron River, the Maumee River, the Sandusky River, the Buffalo River, and the Cuyahoga River.
