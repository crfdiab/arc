What factors help determine the type of soil?
---------------------------------------------

Soil Forming Factors

- Parent material. Few soils weather directly from the underlying rocks.
- Climate. Soils vary, depending on the climate.
- Topography. Slope and aspect affect the moisture and temperature of soil.
- Biological factors. Plants, animals, micro-organisms, and humans affect soil formation.
- Time. What determines the thickness of the soil profile 1 point?
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    
    Time determines the thickness of soil profile as many layers of sand, weathered rock, humus gets deposited over the already present soil layer.
    
    What are the 4 layers of soil called?
    -------------------------------------
    
    Soils are named and classified based on their horizons. The soil profile has four distinct layers: 1) O horizon; 2) A horizon; 3) B horizon, or subsoil; and 4) C horizon, or soil base (Figure 31.2. 2). The O horizon has freshly decomposing organic matter—humus—at its surface, with decomposed vegetation at its base.
    
    Which is the best factor to determine soil type?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    So, depending on the soil color, the condition of the soil can be determined. Dark colored soil: The organic matter, available nitrogen, fertility and aeration will be very high whereas erosion factor will be low. Medium colored soil: All factors will be medium.
    
    How does human activity affect the composition of soil?
    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    Human activities have a huge impact on soil composition. As we dig up soil and move it in order to build, we alter the soil’s composition by relocating certain types of soil. On a smaller level, adding organic materials to soil can improve it and make it more nutritious for vegetation.
    
    Why are the characteristics of soil so important?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    Characteristics of soil will allow you to determine what type of soil is in an area. Scientists use characteristics of soil to learn more about a region’s history and any shift within the region. There are seven soil characteristics that are used to classify the soil: composition, color, texture, structure, soil water, organic matter and chemistry.
    
    How does the size of the pore space affect the quality of soil?
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    
    How coarse or fine soil feels depends on the size of the mineral particles. Sand, silt and clay — the major mineral particles — are responsible for the size and number of soil pore spaces. Pore space determines the amount of air and oxygen in soil, the drainage rate and soil’s capacity to hold nutrients.
