What are some of the major products that destroy the ozone?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The main uses of ozone depleting substances include:

- CFCs and HCFCs in refrigerators and air conditioners,
- HCFCs and halons in fire extinguishers,
- CFCs and HCFCs in foam,
- CFCs and HCFCs as aerosol propellants, and.
- methyl bromide for fumigation of soil, structures and goods to be imported or exported. What is the most ozone depleting gas?
    -------------------------------------
    
    Chlorofluorocarbons. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were widely used as refrigerants until the 1980s when it was confirmed that they were the main source of harm to the ozone layer. They are also considered greenhouse gases that cause climate change.
    
    How many ozone molecules are destroyed in one atom?
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the stratosphere. Some compounds such as chlorine or bromine when they are exposed to intense UV light in the stratosphere.
    
    Which is the best way to regulate the level of ozone?
    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    Both eco friendly and health friendly, this sanitizer, apart from other eco-friendly qualities, regulates ozone production to a safe level. The sanitizer has an advanced microcomputer, and a light indicator to gauge water flow, thus will help detect ozone level.
    
    How is the sanitizer used to detect ozone?
    ------------------------------------------
    
    The sanitizer has an advanced microcomputer, and a light indicator to gauge water flow, thus will help detect ozone level. And, to maximize the ozone concentration in every cubic volume of water, the sanitizer has a unique patented feature. Utilizing this feature one can easily diffuse ozone at the faucet aerator adapter.
    
    What is the ozone depleting potential of CFC-11?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    CFC-11, with an ozone depleting potential of 1.0, is used as the base figure for measuring ozone depleting potential. The higher the number, the more damage a chemical can cause to the ozone layer.
