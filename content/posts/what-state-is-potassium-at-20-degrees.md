What is Coppers standard state?
-------------------------------

Name: copper. Symbol: Cu. Atomic number: 29. Relative atomic mass (Ar): 63.546 (3) r \[see note r\] Standard state: solid at 298 K.

What is the state matter of copper?
-----------------------------------

Copper is a metallic solid in its conventional state. As a solid, the molecules of copper occupy a stable configuration known as a crystal lattice. If the temperature is above 1,984 degrees Fahrenheit, solid copper melts and becomes a liquid.

What classification is coppers?
-------------------------------

Copper is a chemical element with symbol Cu and atomic number 29. Classified as a transition metal, Copper is a solid at room temperature.

Does copper contain electricity?
--------------------------------

Copper has the best electrical conductivity of any metal, except silver. A good electrical conductivity is the same as a small electrical resistance….Good Electrical Conductivity.

What are the properties and uses of copper?
-------------------------------------------

Key Properties of Copper Alloys

- Excellent heat conductivity.
- Excellent electrical conductivity.
- Good corrosion resistance.
- Good biofouling resistance.
- Good machinability.
- Retention of mechanical and electrical properties at cryogenic temperatures.
- Non-magnetic.

What is a copper rich ore?
--------------------------

These ores are a mixture of copper carbonate, sulfate, phosphate, and oxide minerals and secondary sulfide minerals, dominantly chalcocite but other minerals such as digenite can be important in some deposits. Often, the nature of the gangue is important, as clay-rich native copper ores prove difficult to liberate.

How does copper exist in nature?
--------------------------------

Copper metal does occur naturally, but by far the greatest source is in minerals such as chalcopyrite and bornite. Copper is obtained from these ores and minerals by smelting, leaching and electrolysis. The major copper-producing countries are Chile, Peru and China.

Is the temperature of copper a solid at a room temperature?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Of course not. Copper is liquid at room temperature. 1084.62 C. Room temperature. You live a mighty warm area

What is the density of metal at 20°C?
-------------------------------------

Density of Selected Substances at 20°C Substance State of Matter Density (g/cm3) Aluminum Solid 2.6984 Brass Solid 8.55a Bronze Solid 8.175a Copper Solid 8.92 Gold Solid 19.3 Iron Solid 7.86 Lead Solid 11.34 Mercury Liquid 13.5939 Nickel Solid 8.90 Osmium Solid 22.61 Silver Solid 10.50 Sodium Solid 0.97

What is the propensity of copper to sublime?
--------------------------------------------

Here and there in the area of solid visible piece of copper a few will be liberated into the space around and bounce around with the air molecules. I can’t say for sure what the propensity of copper to sublime is – sublime is the act of a solid turning directly into a gas. This becomes a concern when working with vacuum chambers.
