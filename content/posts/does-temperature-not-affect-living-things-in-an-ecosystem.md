Does temperature not affect living things in an ecosystem?
----------------------------------------------------------

Temperature affects the physiology of living things as well as the density and state of water. It exerts an important influence on living organisms because few can survive at temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) due to metabolic constraints.

How do sunlight and temperature influence an ecosystem?
-------------------------------------------------------

The two most important climatic factors for ecosystems are sunlight and water. Sunlight is necessary for plants to grow, and to provide energy to warm the earth’s atmosphere. Light intensity controls plant growth. Light duration affects plant flowering and animal/insect habits.

How does sunlight affect organisms in an ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------------

The two most important climatic factors for ecosystems are sunlight and water. Sunlight is necessary for plants to grow, and to provide energy to warm the earth’s atmosphere. Light intensity controls plant growth. At the other maximum, some plants and animals only survive by being submersed in water.

How do temperature light and soil affect an ecosystem?
------------------------------------------------------

Temperature also affects the plants that will do well there. Light affects the ecosystem because certain plants need a certain amount of sunlight. Soil affects the ecosystem because if soil does not have the correct minerals and decaying in it the plants that are suppose to grow in that ecosystem can’t.

How does temperature affect an organism?
----------------------------------------

Temperature. Temperature has the single most important influence on the distribution of organisms because it determines the physical state of water. Few organisms can remain for long periods at temperatures above 45 °C, because organic molecules such as proteins will begin to denature.

What are 3 variables that affect a living system?
-------------------------------------------------

three variables that can affect the living system are:

- environment.
- temperature.
- food.

How can soil affect an ecosystem?
---------------------------------

Soil provides ecosystem services critical for life: soil acts as a water filter and a growing medium; provides habitat for billions of organisms, contributing to biodiversity; and supplies most of the antibiotics used to fight diseases.

Why is temperature important for survival of living organism give any two reasons?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Temperature. Temperature has the single most important influence on the distribution of organisms because it determines the physical state of water. Most organisms cannot live in conditions in which the temperature remains below 0 °C or above 45 °C for any length of time.

Which is a non living factor in an ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------

Non-living factor in an ecosystem, such as moisture, temperature, wind, sunlight, soil, and minerals. Living things such as plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria. Organism that obtains its energy from abiotic sources such as sunlight or inorganic chemicals.

How are air, water, and soil related?
-------------------------------------

Soil provides nutrients, water, oxygen and heat to natural land areas. Understanding the ability and capacity of soil to support an ecosystem plays an important role in land management decisions. Air is a third critical resource for humans, plants, animals and all other organisms within a natural area.

How does soil temperature affect the rate of photosynthesis?
------------------------------------------------------------

This is due to the increased viscosity and decreased absorption rate of water at low temperature Toselli et al. 44 Decreased water uptake reduces the rate of photosynthesis. The metabolic activities of micro-organisms play an important role in the cycling of nutrients in the soil and ensuring the nutrients are in a form available to plants.

How does climate change affect water, air and soil?
---------------------------------------------------

This research focus area looks at the long term effects of climate change on the water, air and soil within a natural area. Pollution added to an atmosphere, water, or soil will directly or indirectly affect a natural area, either immediately or in the future.
