What makes the Red Sea salty?
-----------------------------

It is extremely warm—temperatures in its surface waters reach than 30° Celsius (86° Fahrenheit)—and water evaporates from it at a prodigious rate, making it extremely salty.

How was sea salt made?
----------------------

Sea salt is produced through evaporation of ocean water or water from saltwater lakes, usually with little processing. Depending on the water source, this leaves behind certain trace minerals and elements. The minerals add flavor and color to sea salt, which also comes in a variety of coarseness levels.

How was the Dead Sea created?
-----------------------------

The African Plate rotates counterclockwise while the Arabian Plate moves roughly northward. As they move apart, faults form in the graben and pieces of crust sink into the mantle. About 3 million years ago, water filled the graben, forming the Dead Sea, which was then part of a long bay of the Mediterranean Sea.

Where does the Red Sea salt come from?
--------------------------------------

Most culinary salt is mined from underground salt deposits, crushed and mixed with potassium iodide and dextrose (sugar) to create the common iodized table salt. Sea salt is harvested from evaporated sea water. Red sea salt is a natural sea salt product from Hawaii that contains numerous healthy minerals.

How big is a bag of Red Sea salt?
---------------------------------

Red Sea Salt is made according to these ideal ratios and remove the need to adjust the levels of foundation elements after water changes and significantly improving the wellbeing of corals. Red Sea Salt is available in these sizes: 4 kg (8.8 lb.) Bag / Water volume: 120 liters (32 gal.) 7 kg.

What can you do with Red Sea salt?
----------------------------------

Red Sea Salt is ideal for reef aquariums, in particular for LPS and SPS corals, and for growing coral frags. Natural seawater includes over 70 chemical elements and although most of the elements influence the water parameters, a few of them have a more significant role in its overall chemical stability.

Why is the salinity of the Red Sea so high?
-------------------------------------------

The main reasons for the high salinity of the Red Sea are: The location of the Red Sea is in a warm region of dry weather, therefore there is a high rate of evaporation and very little precipitation. Because of the dry conditions, the coastal areas surrounding the Red Sea lack of significant rivers…
