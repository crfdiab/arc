What cosmic event occurred in 1908?
-----------------------------------

The Tunguska explosion  
Bottom line: The Tunguska explosion on June 30, 1908, was the largest asteroid impact in recorded history. It flattened 830 square miles (2150 sq km) of Siberian forest.

What is the estimated mass of the projectile that exploded over Tunguska in 1908?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on diameter, depth and morphology of the lake crater, and assuming that the impacting object was an asteroid, a mass of 1.5 × 106 kg (∼10 m diameter) was estimated for the projectile.

Why is the Tunguska event important?
------------------------------------

The study of the Tunguska event is important because past collisions with extraterrestrial bodies have had major effects on the evolution of the earth. Some 4.4 billion years ago, for example, a Mars-size planetoid seems to have struck our young planet, throwing out enough debris to create our moon.

How much energy did the Tunguska Event release?
-----------------------------------------------

At 7:17 a.m. (local Siberia time), at a height of about 28,000 feet, the combination of pressure and heat caused the asteroid to fragment and annihilate itself, producing a fireball and releasing energy equivalent to about 185 Hiroshima bombs.

How many asteroids have already been identified?
------------------------------------------------

As of 29 October 2018, the LINEAR system alone has discovered 147,132 asteroids. Among all the surveys, 19,266 near-Earth asteroids have been discovered including almost 900 more than 1 km (0.6 mi) in diameter.

What would happen if Apophis hit Earth?
---------------------------------------

Goldstone single-pixel observations of Apophis have ruled out the potential 2036 Earth impact. Apophis will then come no closer than about 23 million kilometres (14×106 mi)—and more likely miss us by something closer to 56 million kilometres (35×106 mi).

Where did the Tunguska asteroid hit in 1908?
--------------------------------------------

On the morning of June 30, 1908, the largest asteroid impact in recorded history occurred in a remote part of Siberia, Russia. The explosion happened over the sparsely populated Eastern Siberian taiga, above Siberia’s Podkamennaya Tunguska River in what is now Krasnoyarsk Krai.

Where was the Tunguska forest explosion in 1908?
------------------------------------------------

On June 30, 1908, there was a massive explosion in a remote forest in Siberia, near the Podkamennaya Tunguska river. The explosion was so powerful, it flattened more than 80 million trees across 820 square miles (2,123 square meters).

How many people were killed in the Tunguska event?
--------------------------------------------------

The explosion over the sparsely populated Eastern Siberian Taiga flattened an estimated 80 million trees over an area of 2,150 km 2 (830 sq mi) of forest, and eyewitness reports suggest that at least three people may have died in the event. The explosion is generally attributed to the air burst of a meteoroid.

What was the cause of the Tunguska blast?
-----------------------------------------

Initially, the Tunguska event was a mystery. But throughout the years, scientists have been studying the blast that caused shockwaves as far as Britain, and today, we have a better picture of what occurred on that day. Leonid Kulik’s photo from his 1929 expedition to the Tunguska site.
