What was the main river used by Lewis and Clark to get from St. Louis to the Rockies?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the Missouri River  
On May 14, the “Corps of Discovery,” featuring some two dozen men, left St. Louis for the American interior. The expedition traveled up the Missouri River in six canoes and two longboats and wintered in Dakota before crossing into Montana, where they first saw the Rocky Mountains.

Did Lewis and Clark travel the Mississippi River?
-------------------------------------------------

Preparations for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Lewis knew that exploring the Louisiana Territory would be no small task and began preparations immediately. From there, Clark took the boat up the Mississippi River while Lewis continued along on horseback to collect additional supplies.

What did Lewis and Clark do in St Louis?
----------------------------------------

The men camped there for a week, while Lewis and Clark measured both the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and Lewis taught Clark how to make celestial observations. The expedition then set out for St. Louis. As they turned upstream into the powerful Mississippi River, Lewis and Clark immediately realized they needed more men.

When did Lewis and Clark reach the Mississippi River?
-----------------------------------------------------

As they turned upstream into the powerful Mississippi River, Lewis and Clark immediately realized they needed more men. All three boats were badly undermanned, and the expedition seldom progressed more than a mile an hour moving upstream. On 28 November the men reached Fort Kaskaskia, some fifty miles south of St. Louis.

Where did the Lewis and Clark Expedition Camp?
----------------------------------------------

St. Louis’ neighboring community of St. Charles, Missouri served as the expedition’s first campsite along the Missouri River during May, 1804. The Lewis and Clark Boat House and Nature Center is home to three replicas of the boats used by the Corps of Discovery, and exhibits about the Missouri River and the Corps’ time in St. Charles.

Where did Lewis and Clark meet in the Ohio River?
-------------------------------------------------

Arriving in Louisville on 14 October, he hired a local pilot to guide the boat safely through a daunting set of rapids known as the Falls of the Ohio, then on a short way to Clarksville, Indiana Territory. Once there, Lewis set off to meet his cocaptain. Over the next two weeks, Lewis and Clark selected the first enlisted members of the expedition.
