Are there any cities in the world that are 50 degrees west?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Seriously, check the map! The only non-Brazilian place at 50 degrees West is the tiny and remote Qaqortoq, Greenland. Locations in the North and South are best known for their extremes. The poles are each covered in snow year round, so expect cold temperatures in these cities to the far North and South.

What are the latitude and longitude coordinates of a place?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Latitude is the angular distance of a place north or south of the earth’s equator. The degree of the angle is between -90° and 90°. longitude and latitude coordinates are usually expressed in degrees and minutes. GPS Coordinates uses Map Coordinates to find coordinates and get your current location.

How many cities are within two degrees of the equator?
------------------------------------------------------

While much of the worth is solidly within hemisphere quadrants, there are many cities that straddle one of the zero points. These cities, by definition, must be either along the equator or the prime meridian (i.e., have a similar longitude to London). The map shows 22 cities that are within two and a half degrees of the equator.
