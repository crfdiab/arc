What kind of soil is in southeastern New Mexico?
------------------------------------------------

The Ogallala Formation is one of the main Tertiary sedimentary formations. What Soil Types Are Present in Southeastern New Mexico? Varied soil types are present in southeastern New Mexico and can be clayey to sandy, cobbly, calcareous or gypseous. Clayey soil develops on siltstone, shale and red beds present in the eastern part of the area.

What kind of drilling is used in southeastern New Mexico?
---------------------------------------------------------

Push probe drilling may be appropriate for southeastern New Mexico where shallow subsurface conditions are sandy or clayey and do not contain gravelly soil or indurated caliche layers. Auger drilling can be used wherever push probe drilling is feasible and potentially in some areas where caliche or gravelly soil is present.

How does lime affect soil pH in New Mexico?
-------------------------------------------

For much of New Mexico, soil pH is controlled by the presence of lime (calcium carbonate). Lime acts as a buffer against changes in soil pH and can tie up phosphorus and iron, making them unavailable for plants.

What kind of geology is found in New Mexico?
--------------------------------------------

Geology in southeastern New Mexico, generally consisting of Chaves, Eddy and Lea Counties, is varied and complex. This area is called the Delaware Basin, the northwestern extent of the Permian Basin of oil producing fame. Bedrock is mainly limestone, with interbedded sandstone and shale.

How much lime is in New Mexico soil?
------------------------------------

Lime is present if the soil fizzes when exposed to vinegar. A soil with 5% lime in the top 6 inches has approximately 2,296 pounds of lime per 1,000 square feet. Soils with more than 3% lime are most likely to have a pH above 7.5.

How can organic matter improve soil in New Mexico?
--------------------------------------------------

Most soils in New Mexico are low in organic matter, and adding organic matter to your garden soil will help improve its structure. Adding organic matter to a sandy soil improves both its water-holding capacity and its cation exchange capacity, or the ability of the soil to retain nutrients for plant uptake.
