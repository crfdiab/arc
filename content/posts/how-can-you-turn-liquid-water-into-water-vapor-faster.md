How can you turn liquid water into water vapor faster?
------------------------------------------------------

In order for water molecules to change from liquid to gas, they must be directly exposed to a source of heat. This means that water with a greater surface area, such as water spread out across a shallow pan, will heat up faster than water with a smaller surface area, such as water in a bowl or cup.

What is another way you can turn water into water vapor?
--------------------------------------------------------

If heat is added to water, it evaporates. Evaporation turns liquid water into a gas called water vapor. In the hydrologic cycle, water from oceans, lakes, swamps, rivers, plants, and even you, can turn into water vapor. Water vapor condenses into millions of tiny droplets that form clouds.

Does putting a lid on water make it boil faster?
------------------------------------------------

Truth: Keep the pot covered. So put a lid on the pan. The air in the pan will heat up as the water heats up, and it circulates back into the water as it’s heated. This helps bring the water to 212 degrees F more quickly. And before you know it, that unwatched pot will be boiling.

How does boiling water change to water vapor?
---------------------------------------------

How It Works. Boiling water is at the point of changing from a liquid into water vapor. It has the same vapor pressure as the air around it, so it has plenty of surface area to expose to a freezing temperature.

What happens when you put water in a vape?
------------------------------------------

When you put water into a vape, you will be choosing to inhale insanely hot steam. Not only is this not the comfortable sensation you are used to with normal vaping, but it can also be harmful to your mouth. When you vape water, it actually turns into very hot water vapor.

Can you put water in a vape and make clouds?
--------------------------------------------

The answer to this question is no, you will not be able to make cool clouds and shapes with the vapor that comes out of the vape pen. The reason for this is that the vapor that comes out when you put just water in the vape will cool much too fast to produce large clouds, or sometimes any visual vapor at all.

When does water evaporate it becomes a gas?
-------------------------------------------

Steam is an invisible gas. You cannot see steam. What you see when a kettle boils is actually tiny drops of water. Liquid water can turn into a gas at any temperature. We say it evaporates. Evaporation happens fastest when water is heated to 212°F (100°C). This is the boiling point of water. When water is boiling, we call the hot water vapor steam.
