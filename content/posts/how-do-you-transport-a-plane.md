- The following are the main advantages:
- High Speed:
- Minimum Cost:
- Strategic Importance:
- Easy transport of costly and light goods:
- Free from physical barriers:
- Useful for Agriculture:
- Useful in natural calamities:

What are the main means of air transport?
-----------------------------------------

Air travel is a form of travel in vehicles such as airplanes, jet aircraft, helicopters, hot air balloons, blimps, gliders, hang gliders, parachutes, or anything else that can sustain flight. Use of air travel has greatly increased in recent decades – worldwide it doubled between the mid-1980s and the year 2000.

What is the largest military transport plane?

What are the 5 modes of transportation?
---------------------------------------

These most common five modes of transport are: railways, roadways, airways, waterways and pipelines. Following is the brief account of each mode with reference to Indian conditions with relative merits and demerits.

What are the examples of air transport?
---------------------------------------

Here’s the types that I know of, whether they are used for pleasure, business, or military purposes:

- Hot air balloons.
- Blimps and dirigibles.
- Helicopters.
- Autogyros.
- Airplanes (planes).
- Ornithopters.
- Gliders.
- Jet packs. Why air transport is considered the most expensive mode of transport?
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Air transport is considered costlier as compare to other mode of transport. Because of this reason the fare of air transport are high that common people can’t afford it. Small Carrying Capacity. The aircrafts have small carrying capacity and therefore these are not suitable for carrying bulky and cheaper goods.

    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    Airlines are known to fail as economic enterprises, public systems encounter deficits, excessive crashes occur on highways, and spacecraft are sometimes lost. Understanding transportation systems in terms of their technological and economic complexity, and their important impacts on society, is a large and fascinating field of study.
    
    Where are the small aircraft transportation systems located?
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The basic concept behind the Small Aircraft Transportation System is simple. Instead of relying on a few big airports, SATS will utilize the more than 5,000 small, local airports situated throughout the United States.
    
    Why is air transportation so important in India?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    Air transport is the most modern means of transport which is unmatched by its speed, time- saving and long-distance operation. It is very impor­tant for a large country like India. Through it one can easily reach to remote and inaccessible areas like mountains, forests, deserts etc.
