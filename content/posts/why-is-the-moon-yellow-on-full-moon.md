Why is the moon yellow on full moon?
------------------------------------

On the full moon day the moon comes low due to some angle changes in earth’s position therefore the light reflected by moon has to travel through more thicker layer of atmosphere. Due to this the blueish white colour won’t reach our eyes but the yellowish light will reach. That’s why it appears yellow.

What color is the yellow moon?
------------------------------

Light on the blue end of the spectrum is scattered away, while the red light isn’t scattered. This is why the Moon looks more red. As it goes higher in the sky, the Moon is obscured by less and less atmosphere, so it turns more yellow – the same thing happens to the Sun as it rises in the sky.

Why is the moon yellow or orange?
---------------------------------

Orange and red light, which have longer wavelengths, tend to pass through the atmosphere, while shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue, get scattered. That’s why the Moon — and the Sun! If you’ve ever seen an orange Moon high in the sky, the atmosphere is still the reason it’s orange.

What happens if the moon is yellow?
-----------------------------------

When the moon appears orange or yellow, it simply means that the observer is looking at it through more layers of atmosphere. By this time, only yellow, orange and red light will remain unabsorbed. A yellow moon is commonly called a Harvest Moon.

Why are orange and yellow the colors of the Moon?
-------------------------------------------------

Colors with longer wavelengths—such as orange—are not absorbed as easily. So when you look at a sunset, a sunrise, a moonrise or moonset, you’re looking at something close to the horizon, where the atmosphere is thickest. The yellow, orange and red end of the spectrum therefore dominate the light that makes it to your eyes.

Why does a Yellow Moon look like a Harvest Moon?
------------------------------------------------

Similar to the way in which the sun will look orange or red on the horizon, when the moon is low in the sky, the light from it will have to pass through more of the blue-absorbing atmosphere to reach the viewer’s eye. By this time, only yellow, orange and red light will remain unabsorbed. A yellow moon is commonly called a Harvest Moon.

Why does the Moon look more red than the Sun?
---------------------------------------------

Light on the blue end of the spectrum is scattered away, while the red light isn’t scattered. This is why the Moon looks more red. As it goes higher in the sky, the Moon is obscured by less and less atmosphere, so it turns more yellow – the same thing happens to the Sun as it rises in the sky.

Why do you see different color moon photos?
-------------------------------------------

When browsing photos of the Moon you might be surprised to find pictures in a variety of stunning colors, including red, yellow, orange, blue, and gray.
