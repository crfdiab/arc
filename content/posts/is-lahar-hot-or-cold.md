Is lahar hot or cold?
---------------------

Lahars can vary from hot to cold, depending on their mode of genesis. The maximum temperature of a lahar is 100 degrees Centigrade, the boiling temperature of water.

Is lahar a lava?
----------------

Lahar, mudflow of volcanic material. A variation is the hot lahar ordinarily produced by the heating of the crater lake water by the quiet upwelling of lava or an explosion. …

Can a lahar kill you?
---------------------

Many times, that allows for enough forewarning to escape if you are downriver, but the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia proved that a lack of preparation can lead to over 20,000 deaths. Due to their density, lahars can destroy infrastructure and homes and bury towns (and people) rapidly.

Is lahar dangerous to health?
-----------------------------

People caught in the path of a lahar have a high risk of death from severe crush injuries, drowning or asphyxiation. Lahars are often highly erosive to river banks and eyewitnesses should remain at a safe distance.

How is lahar deadly?
--------------------

Lahars are extremely destructive: they can flow tens of metres per second, they have been known to be up to 140 metres (460 ft) deep, and large flows tend to destroy any structures in their path.

Is the lahar a hot or cold flow?
--------------------------------

Lahars are debris flows associated with volcanoes, and can be further classified as either hot or cold depending on their temperature .

Which is the best description of a lahar?
-----------------------------------------

Lahars are debris flows associated with volcanoes, and can be further classified as either hot or cold depending on their temperature . The word lahar is of Indonesian origin, reflecting the frequency of volcanic debris flows in that region. Lahars can be mobilized by processes similar to those producing non-volcanic debris flows,…

Can a lahar occur without a volcanic eruption?
----------------------------------------------

Although usually associated with volcanic activity, lahars can occur without volcanic activity if the necessary conditions trigger the collapse and flow of mud from existing deposits of volcanic ash. Therefore, glaciers and snow can melt during hot weather can cause lahars.

What is the average speed of a lahar?
-------------------------------------

In steep areas, lahars can exceed speeds of 200 km/hr (120 mi/hr), but as they move farther away from a volcano and decelerate in lowland areas, they eventually begin to deposit some of the load and decrease in size. Volcanic mudflows (lahars and debris flows) occur more commonly after a landscape has been covered by loose volcanic material.
