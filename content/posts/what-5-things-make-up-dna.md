What 5 things make up DNA?
--------------------------

Your genome? is made of a chemical called deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA for short. DNA contains four basic building blocks or ‘bases?’: adenine? (A), cytosine? (C), guanine? (G) and thymine? (T). The order, or sequence, of these bases form the instructions in the genome.

What 2 strands make up DNA?
---------------------------

A DNA molecule consists of two strands that wind around each other like a twisted ladder. Each strand has a backbone made of alternating groups of sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups. Attached to each sugar is one of four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T).

What is the difference between DNA and RNA?
-------------------------------------------

Like DNA, RNA is made up of nucleotides. There are two differences that distinguish DNA from RNA: (a) RNA contains the sugar ribose, while DNA contains the slightly different sugar deoxyribose (a type of ribose that lacks one oxygen atom), and (b) RNA has the nucleobase uracil while DNA contains thymine.

Is DNA A cell?
--------------

In organisms called eukaryotes, DNA is found inside a special area of the cell called the nucleus. Because the cell is very small, and because organisms have many DNA molecules per cell, each DNA molecule must be tightly packaged. Researchers refer to DNA found in the cell’s nucleus as nuclear DNA.

What is DNA function and structure?
-----------------------------------

DNA is the information molecule. It stores instructions for making other large molecules, called proteins. These instructions are stored inside each of your cells, distributed among 46 long structures called chromosomes. These chromosomes are made up of thousands of shorter segments of DNA, called genes.

What are the basic structure of a DNA?
--------------------------------------

Each DNA strand is composed of nucleotides—units made up of a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. Each strand of DNA is a polynucleotide composed of units called nucleotides. A nucleotide has three components: a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.

How many DNA strands do humans have?
------------------------------------

46 DNA molecules  
The diploid human genome is thus composed of 46 DNA molecules of 24 distinct types. Because human chromosomes exist in pairs that are almost identical, only 3 billion nucleotide pairs (the haploid genome) need to be sequenced to gain complete information concerning a representative human genome.

What is difference between DNA and RNA?
---------------------------------------

Thus, the major difference between DNA and RNA is that DNA is double-stranded and RNA is single-stranded. DNA is responsible for genetic information transmission, whereas RNA transmits genetic codes that are necessary for protein creation.

What are 5 differences between DNA and RNA?
-------------------------------------------

DNA contains the sugar deoxyribose, while RNA contains the sugar ribose. DNA and RNA base pairing is slightly different since DNA uses the bases adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine; RNA uses adenine, uracil, cytosine, and guanine. Uracil differs from thymine in that it lacks a methyl group on its ring.

What are two major differences between DNA and RNA?
---------------------------------------------------

There are two differences that distinguish DNA from RNA: (a) RNA contains the sugar ribose, while DNA contains the slightly different sugar deoxyribose (a type of ribose that lacks one oxygen atom), and (b) RNA has the nucleobase uracil while DNA contains thymine.

Where is DNA in our body?
-------------------------

cell nucleus  
Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus (where it is called nuclear DNA), but a small amount of DNA can also be found in the mitochondria (where it is called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).

What makes up the structure of the DNA molecule?
------------------------------------------------

The DNA molecule consists of 4 nitrogen bases, namely adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and Guanine (G) which ultimately forms the structure of a nucleotide. The A and G are purines and the C and T are pyrimidines. The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions.

What makes up the backbone of the DNA strand?
---------------------------------------------

The DNA molecule is made up of nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains three different components — a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogen base. The sugar in DNA is called 2’-deoxyribose. These sugar molecules alternate with the phosphate groups, making up the “backbone” of the DNA strand.

What makes DNA unique to the human body?
----------------------------------------

Deoxyribonucleic acid—or DNA— is a molecule that serves as the hereditary material containing biological instructions that make every human and other organism unique. During reproduction, adult organisms pass their DNA and its set of instructions along to their offspring.

How are proteins made using instructions from DNA?
--------------------------------------------------

It takes two separate steps to make proteins using instructions from DNA. The first is when enzymes read the information delivered in a DNA molecule and then transcribe it to a separate molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA.
