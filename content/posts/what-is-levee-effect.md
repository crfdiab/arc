What is levee effect?
---------------------

The levee effect refers to the paradox that the construction of a levee to protect from flooding might induce property owners to invest more in their property, increasing the potential damages should the levee breach. Thus, paradoxically, the levee might increase flood risk.

How do cities prevent flooding?
-------------------------------

Ditch-diggers and cement trucks? Try trees and rainwater cisterns. Instead of building costly water-treatment plants and dams to protect their citizens from water pollution, cities across the country are investing in green infrastructure. …

Why do cities get flooded?
--------------------------

Urban flooding occurs when water flows into an urban region faster than it can be absorbed into the soil or moved to and stored in a lake or reservoir. It can be caused by flash flooding, coastal flooding, river floods or rapid snow melt. Flash floods occur suddenly, and the water can flow quickly.

How are levees used to protect the environment?
-----------------------------------------------

Levees may be used to increase available land for habitation or divert a body of water so the fertile soil of a river or sea bed may be used for agriculture. They prevent rivers from flooding cities in a storm surge.

What happens when a levee breaks in a flood?
--------------------------------------------

All the river’s power is flowing through a smaller space. Water levels are higher and water flows faster. This puts more pressure on levees downstream and makes the water more difficult to control. If levees break, it also makes containing the flood more difficult.

Why did the levees in New Orleans fail?
---------------------------------------

Many factors led to people being stranded for hours or days, going without food and water for many days, and even dying. However, the flooding that occurred after the storm could have been prevented if the levees that surround the city had not broken in the first place.

Why are there so many levees in the Netherlands?
------------------------------------------------

Although most levees exist to control rivers, they can also exist on the coast. The country of the Netherlands has an elaborate system of dikes, levees, and dams to hold back the North Sea. Land for farms, industry, and residential use has been created from land that was once the ocean floor.
