Why do countries put tariffs on imports?
----------------------------------------

Tariffs are taxes charged on the import of goods from foreign countries. They do this by increasing the price of imported goods in order to persuade consumers to purchase domestic products instead.

Why do countries put tariffs on imports and exports?
----------------------------------------------------

Governments impose tariffs to raise revenue, protect domestic industries, or exert political leverage over another country. Tariffs often result in unwanted side effects, such as higher consumer prices.

How does an import tariff affect the price of imports?
------------------------------------------------------

An import tariff will raise the domestic price and, in the case of a large country, lower the foreign price. An import tariff will reduce the quantity of imports. An import tariff will raise the price of the “untaxed” domestic import-competing good.

How are tariffs different in different countries of the world?
--------------------------------------------------------------

This tariff can vary according to the type of good imported. For example, a country could levy a $15 tariff on each pair of shoes imported, but levy a $300 tariff on each computer imported. The phrase “ad valorem” is Latin for “according to value,” and this type of tariff is levied on a good based on a percentage of that good’s value.

What is the difference between a trade barrier and a tariff?
------------------------------------------------------------

A nontariff barrier is a trade restriction, such as a quota, embargo or sanction, that countries use to further their political and economic goals. A trade war—a side effect of protectionism—happens when country A raises tariffs on country B’s imports in retaliation for them raising tariffs on country A’s imports.

What are common reasons for governments to implement tariffs?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The most common examples of rationale used to justify tariffs are protection for nascent industries, national defense purposes, supporting domestic employment, combating aggressive trade policies and environmental reasons.
