Why is Japan densely populated?
-------------------------------

Because a majority of Japan is made up of these mountainous or forested areas, much of the land can’t be used for agricultural, or industrial purposes. ‘ These dense populations in habitable areas make Japan one of the most closely-populated countries in the entire world.

Is Japan’s population growing?
------------------------------

Until 2019, the latest year available from Japan’s Statistics Bureau, the country of 126 million inhabitants has lost around 1.6 million people. After coming close to growing again in 2015, the trend has intensified once more. 28 percent of Japan’s population was over the age of 65 as of October 1, 2019.

What is unique about Japan’s population growth?
-----------------------------------------------

Japan’s population is aging faster than that of any other nation. The population of those 65 years or older roughly doubled in 24 years, from 7.1% of the population in 1970 to 14.1% in 1994. The same increase took 61 years in Italy, 85 years in Sweden, and 115 years in France.

How and why did Japan control its population growth?
----------------------------------------------------

After World War II, the Japanese government adopted a different method of tackling population growth. Whereas the pre-war government was comfortable with relieving Japan’s surplus population by emigration and territorial expansion, the post-war government relied on birth control to slow the population growth.

Is Japan densely?
-----------------

Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with 337 people per square kilometer (899 people per square mile). The largest island of Honshu is also the most densily populated with northernmost island of Hokkaido being the least densely populated with an average of 65 people per square mile.

When did the population of Japan begin to decline?
--------------------------------------------------

Japan’s population began to decline in 2011. The nation’s birthrate is at its lowest since 1899, with fewer babies being born each year than the previous year. In 2018, there were less than 1 million babies born for the third year in a row and a fertility rate of only 1.45 births per woman.

What does it mean if Japan’s population is shrinking?
-----------------------------------------------------

Japan’s population is shrinking: What does it mean for the economy? Japan’s population has fallen by nearly 1 million in the past five years, in the first decline since the census began in 1920. This is bad news for the country’s shrinking economy, which is unable to depend on an expanding labour force to drive growth.

Is the population of Japan going to grow?
-----------------------------------------

Many of Japan’s neighbors are well aware of its rapidly aging and shrinking population, and it seems likely that the nation’s population will start growing at some point in time — whether or not that takes place in ways that is desirable. That scenario should be kept in mind, even if only as food for thought.

Why does Japan have a high population concentration?
----------------------------------------------------

Japan has a high population concentration in urban areas on the plains since 75% of Japan’s land area is made up of mountains, and also Japan has a forest cover rate of 68.5% (the only other developed countries with such a high forest cover percentage are Finland and Sweden).
