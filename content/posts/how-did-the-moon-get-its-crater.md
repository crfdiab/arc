How did the Moon get its crater?
--------------------------------

Craters on the Moon are caused by asteroids and meteorites colliding with the lunar surface. The Moon’s surface is covered with thousands of craters. The Earth is also covered in water and vegetation which easily disguises impact craters.

What is a moon crater?
----------------------

Moon craters are bowl-shaped landforms created by two processes: volcanism and cratering. There are hundreds of thousands of moon craters ranging from less than a mile across to giant basins called mare, which were once thought to be seas.

Is the Moon the only one with craters?
--------------------------------------

The researchers found that although both sides of the Moon had the same total number of impact craters, the near side had eight basins larger than 320 kilometres in diameter, whereas the far side had only one. The asteroid bombardment should have battered both sides equally, Miljkovi points out.

How big is the crater on the moon?
----------------------------------

Stretching 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometers) wide and 8 miles (13 km) deep, the South Pole-Aitken basin, as the tremendous hole is known to Earthlings, is the oldest and deepest crater on the moon, and one of the largest craters in the entire solar system.

Which is the largest crater on the Moon?
----------------------------------------

The large and relatively young lunar impact crater Tycho taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. This is a list of named lunar craters. The large majority of these features are impact craters.

Are there any new craters on the Moon?
--------------------------------------

Planetary scientists believe that small impacts regularly bombard the Moon, but until recently, they’ve had no way to distinguish new craters from the already pockmarked lunar surface. In 2009, NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) arrived at the Moon and began taking high-resolution photographs.

How are the age of the craters on the moon determined?
------------------------------------------------------

The age of large craters is determined by the number of smaller craters contained within it, older craters generally accumulating more small, contained craters.

Where did the names of lunar craters come from?
-----------------------------------------------

Craters constitute 95% of all named lunar features. Usually they are named after deceased scientists and other explorers. This tradition comes from Giovanni Battista Riccioli, who started it in 1651. Since 1919, assignment of these names is regulated by the International Astronomical Union.
