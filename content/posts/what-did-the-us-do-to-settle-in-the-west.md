What did the US do to settle in the West?
-----------------------------------------

From the 1820s through the 1840s, westerners pushed for more liberal land laws, calling for “free homesteads” or “donations” for those who would settle on the land. The Homestead Act, which became law on May 20, 1862, was responsible for helping settle much of the American West.

Why did Americans move to the western frontier?
-----------------------------------------------

While it was true that western lands were somewhat more fertile than the now-depleted lands of the East, many of the pioneers were attracted to the frontier in order to speculate in land, i.e. to purchase large quantities of cheap government land and to sell it at a profit to later comers.

Why did Americans start settling in the West?
---------------------------------------------

Gold rush and mining opportunities (silver in Nevada) The opportunity to work in the cattle industry; to be a “cowboy” Faster travel to the West by railroad; availability of supplies due to the railroad. The opportunity to own land cheaply under the Homestead Act.

How did people travel to the western frontier?
----------------------------------------------

Before the 1850’s, most people traveled westward by boat or wagon. These methods proved slow and expensive, and they provided limited access to western lands. The railroad, or “iron horse,” became a vital new travel option, especially after the 1860’s. The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 authorized a transcontinental rail line.

What was life like for the pioneers in the west?
------------------------------------------------

Pioneers traveled in wagon trains Western frontier life in Americadescribes one of the most exciting periods in the history of the United States. From 1850 to 1900, swift and widespread changes transformed the American West. At the beginning of that period, a great variety of Native American cultures dominated most parts of the region.

Where did the settlers go during the westward expansion?
--------------------------------------------------------

Thousands of people crossed the Rockies to the Oregon Territory, which belonged to Great Britain, and thousands more moved into the Mexican territories of California, New Mexico and Texas. In 1837, American settlers in Texas joined with their Tejano neighbors (Texans of Spanish origin) and won independence from Mexico.

What did farmers need in the western frontier?
----------------------------------------------

In 1858, Lewis Miller patented a mowing machine that permitted farmers to gather grain into bundles, again improving efficiency. Horses, mules, and oxen provided the power for plowing, hauling, and other farm chores. Tractors and trucks would not appear until the 1900’s. Farmers needed seeds, equipment, household goods, animal feed, and credit.
