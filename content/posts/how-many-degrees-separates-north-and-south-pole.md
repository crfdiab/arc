How many degrees separates North and South Pole?
------------------------------------------------

90 degrees  
Each parallel measures one degree north or south of the Equator, with 90 degrees north of the Equator and 90 degrees south of the Equator. The latitude of the North Pole is 90 degrees N, and the latitude of the South Pole is 90 degrees S.

What runs North and South Pole to pole?
---------------------------------------

The imaginary vertical lines that run from the North pole to the South pole on a map are called longitudinal lines. The Prime Meridian is the longitudinal line that has a value of 0 degrees. The equator is equidistant from the North and South poles. Thus, the equator separates the northern and southern hemispheres.

What is the distance from the North Pole to the South Pole?
-----------------------------------------------------------

From North-Pole to the South Pole, it is 12,440.01 mi (20,020.26 km) in the north. Where do I get to when I dig a hole in North-Pole through the centre of the earth? This is the point on the Earth’s surface when you draw a straight line from North-Pole through the centre of the earth.

Where is the Magnetic North Pole on Earth?
------------------------------------------

The geomagnetic north is found in the northwest coast of Greenland and is the northern end of a planet-sized bar magnet. The magnetic north Pole is more susceptible to flows and surges in the swirl of hot liquid iron in the Earth’s Core.

Why does the magnetic north pole rotate faster than the Earth?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The movement or flow by the liquid metal in the earth’s core rotates faster than the surface of the earth causing electrons to flow like a convective dynamo. The electron current results in the Earth Magnetic Field. The Polar Shift Theory explains the movement of the Magnetic North Pole.

How big is the Earth from pole to pole?
---------------------------------------

If you go from pole to pole through the Earth, the distance is approximately twice the semi-major axis length (6,356,752.314 m) plus the elevation at each pole. If you want the distance around the surface, so passing over the equator, if we take the distance along the reference ellipsoid (GRS80) from pole to pole, it is 20,003,931.459 m.
