What method is used by geologist to locate the epicenter of an earthquake?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scientists use triangulation to find the epicenter of an earthquake. When seismic data is collected from at least three different locations, it can be used to determine the epicenter by where it intersects. Every earthquake is recorded on numerous seismographs located in different directions.

Which strategy do geologists use to locate?
-------------------------------------------

Geologists use seismic waves to locate the center of an earthquake.

Which statements concerning how geologists locate an earthquake’s epicenter are accurate?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer: Geologists use seismic waves to locate the center of an earthquake geologists use data from three or more data stations determined the location of the epicenter. A seismograph mmeasures the difference between the arrivals of P waves and S waves..

How do geologists locate the epicenter of an earthquake?
--------------------------------------------------------

This is done by drawing a circle around the location of the seismic station that has an equal radius between the station and the distance the waves traveled. This should be done with all three and it should produce an overlap. The epicenter of the earthquake is in the area represented by the overlap.

Can a meteorologist see the Earth during an earthquake?
-------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, Earth is not transparent and we can’t just see or photograph the earthquake disturbance like meteorologists can photograph clouds. When an earthquake occurs, it generates an expanding wavefront from the earthquake hypocenter at a speed of several kilometers per second.

How do seismologists locate an earthquake in California?
--------------------------------------------------------

Note that the earthquake arrives first on station C, so C is a good first guess for the location. Many earthquakes in California occur between 2 and 12 kilometers depth and we will guess a 6 kilometer depth. The origin time should be a few seconds before the time of the wave at the first station.

How are earthquakes recorded on the earth’s surface?
----------------------------------------------------

We observe earthquakes with a network of seismometers on the earth’s surface. The ground motion at each seismometer is amplified and recorded electronically at a central recording site. As the wavefront expands from the earthquake, it reaches more distant seismic stations.
