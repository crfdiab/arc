What types of crops did peasants grow during the Middle Ages?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Common crops produced in the Middle Ages included wheat, beans, barley, peas and oats. Most farmers had a spring and a fall crop. The spring crop often produced barley and beans while the fall crop produced wheat and rye. The wheat and rye were used for bread or sold to make money.

How many acres did a peasant farm?
----------------------------------

From Medieval Manors I learn that a single peasant farmer worked 20-40 acres of land, so let’s settle on 30 acres. From Google, I learn that 1 square mile is 640 acres, so that square mile that could support 180 people means about 21 peasant farmers worth of land in a square mile.

What did farmers do in the Middle Ages?
---------------------------------------

Farming in the Middle Ages was done by peasants and serfs. Peasant farmers made just enough money to live on while serfs had no rights and were all but slaves to the lords whose land they lived on. Some serf farmers eventually earned rights in exchange for back-breaking work seven days a week and on-command service to their lord.

What kind of fertilisers did medieval farmers use?
--------------------------------------------------

The use of manure was basic and artificial fertilisers as we would know did not exist. Growing crops was a very hit and miss affair and a successful crop was due to a lot of hard work but also the result of some luck. In the summer (the growing season) farmers needed sun to get their crops to grow.
