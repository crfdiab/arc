What can you use for navigation on the Moon?
--------------------------------------------

There are several other methods of celestial navigation that will also provide position-finding using sextant observations, such as the noon sight, and the more archaic lunar distance method. Joshua Slocum used the lunar distance method during the first recorded single-handed circumnavigation of the world.

How do you use a compass as a moon?
-----------------------------------

Using the Moon as a Compass If you draw an imaginary line between the sharp points on a crescent moon, and then continue the line down towards the horizon. If you are in the northern hemisphere, then this point on the horizon indicates South and if you are in the Southern hemisphere then it points to north.

How can the Moon tell us which way is north?
--------------------------------------------

The moon will tell you where the sun is, and from the sun’s position, you can figure out north. Face the full moon, and the sun is right behind you. When the moon is new and you see it as only a thin sickle, the sun is in front of you, under the horizon. Once you know where the sun is, use your watch to find north.

What direction does the Moon set?
---------------------------------

The moon rises in the east and sets in the west, each and every day. It has to. The rising and setting of all celestial objects is due to Earth’s continuous daily spin beneath the sky.

Does GPS work on the moon?
--------------------------

When you’re lost on Earth, GPS is a lifeline; now, IEEE Spectrum reports, it could be on the Moon, as well. They found that five to 13 of these 81 satellites would call out to lunar orbit at any one time—enough to locate a position to 200 or 300 meters, they reported at a conference this month. …

Does the moon rotate?
---------------------

The moon does rotate on its axis. One rotation takes nearly as much time as one revolution around Earth. If the moon were to rotate quickly (several times each month) or not rotate at all, Earth would be exposed to all sides of the moon (i.e. multiple different views).

Is there GPS in space?
----------------------

The Global Positioning System has helped many people find their way on earth. Now, this network of satellites may help fellow satellites find their way in space, and keep orbiting communications devices from colliding.

Do astronauts use GPS?
----------------------

Could it help astronauts on lunar voyages? Kar-Ming Cheung and Charles Lee of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California did the math, and concluded that the answer is yes: Signals from existing global navigation satellites near the Earth could be used to guide astronauts in lunar orbit, 385,000 km away.

Is there a way to find direction using the Moon?
------------------------------------------------

There are fast and slow methods for finding direction naturally using the moon, but unfortunately no known fast accurate methods. It is no less interesting for this. The first technique to learn is beautifully simple and extremely quick.

What can you do when you land on the Moon?
------------------------------------------

Explore. Once you land on the moon, it’s time to take that one small step and explore the lunar surface. While there, you can gather lunar rocks and dust for analysis on Earth, and if you brought along a collapsible lunar rover as the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions did, you can even hot-rod on the lunar surface at up to 11.2 mph (18 km/hr).

How to navigate using the Moon-the natural navigator?
-----------------------------------------------------

For detailed and expert methods for using the moon please see these books. The moon is a fascinating and sometimes slippery object for the natural navigator. There are fast and slow methods for finding direction naturally using the moon, but unfortunately no known fast accurate methods. It is no less interesting for this.

Is there a way to generate electricity from the Moon?
-----------------------------------------------------

It turns out, there’s a way that we can generate electricity from the moon — thanks to the tides created by the gravitational pull the moon exerts on Earth’s oceans. The Earth is tugged by the sun and moon. The sun dwarfs the moon in size, but the moon is much closer to Earth — around 239,000 miles away,…
