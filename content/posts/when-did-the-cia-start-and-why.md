When did the CIA start and why?
-------------------------------

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), principal foreign intelligence and counterintelligence agency of the U.S. government. Formally created in 1947, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) grew out of the World War II Office of Strategic Services (OSS).

Why did the CIA begin?
----------------------

These are that the CIA was established to help counter the Soviet threat, that it was a response to Pearl Harbor, and that it was the outcome of a decision to adopt the least unpopular of several proposed arrangements for the conduct of foreign intelligence.

What was before the CIA?
------------------------

The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the United States during World War II, and a predecessor to the Department of State’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR), and the independent Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

When it was created what was the job of the CIA?
------------------------------------------------

The 1947 Act charged the CIA with coordinating the nation’s intelligence activities and correlating, evaluating and disseminating intelligence which affects national security. In addition, the Agency was to perform such other duties and functions related to intelligence as the NSC might direct.

When was the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) established?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The six years prior to the formal beginning of the Central Intelligence Agency saw many variations of the agency. Established on July 11, 1941, the COI lasted 337 days. At the beginning of World War II, the State Department, Army, Navy, and FBI were randomly collecting intelligence with no direction or coordination.

Who was the first director of the CIA?
--------------------------------------

Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the first Director of the newly created Central Intelligence Agency. The role of the DCI changed in 2004, when President George W. Bush signed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. This new act restructured the Intelligence Community and created the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).

What was the purpose of the CIA in 1947?
----------------------------------------

The CIA was organized in September 1947, mostly employing people who had been with the OSS to do the job that the OSS had done in WWII plus some additional work. The CIA still has the function of coordination of US ARMY, NAVY and now US AIR FORCE intelligence information.

When did the CIA become part of the National Security Council?
--------------------------------------------------------------

In 1947 Congress passed the National Security Act, which created the National Security Council (NSC) and, under its direction, the CIA.
