How did continental drift affect Pangea?
----------------------------------------

According to the continental drift theory, the supercontinent Pangaea began to break up about 225-200 million years ago, eventually fragmenting into the continents as we know them today.

How does continental drift affect mountain ranges?
--------------------------------------------------

Wegener said the rocks had formed side-by-side and that the land had since moved apart. Mountain ranges with the same rock types, structures, and ages are now on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Wegener concluded that they formed as a single mountain range that was separated as the continents drifted.

How does continental drift cause mountain building?
---------------------------------------------------

Continents and oceanic crust have collided or subducted at tectonic plate margins. Mountain ranges have been formed, and processes of erosion have torn them down. Eventually, the continents are split apart by renewed plate divergence and are on their way to new collisions, often forming a supercontinent.

Where did the formation of the Appalachian Mountains take place?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Appalachian Mountains: Researchers have developed a new picture of the continental collision that formed the southern Appalachians. PROVIDENCE, R.I. \[Brown University\] â€” Around 300 million years ago, the landmass that is now North America collided with Gondwana, a supercontinent comprised of present-day Africa and South America.

When was the theory of continental drift developed?
---------------------------------------------------

The continental drift hypothesis was developed in the early part of the 20th century, mostly by Alfred Wegener.

Are there any mountain ranges like the Appalachians?
----------------------------------------------------

The Appalachians of the eastern United States and Canada, for example, are just like mountain ranges in eastern Greenland, Ireland, Great Britain, and Norway.

What kind of fossils are found in continental drift?
----------------------------------------------------

Wegener, trained as an astronomer, used biology, botany, and geology describe Pangaea and continental drift. For example, fossil s of the ancient reptile mesosaurus are only found in southern Africa and South America. Mesosaurus, a freshwater reptile only one meter (3.3 feet) long, could not have swum the Atlantic Ocean.
