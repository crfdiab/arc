What describes how many degrees east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Longitudes for the Earth and Moon are measured from their prime meridian at 0° to 180° east and to 180° west. For all other Solar System bodies, longitude is measured from 0° (their prime meridian) to 360°. West longitudes are used if the rotation of the body is direct, that is, it follows the right hand rule.

What is east or west of the Prime Meridian?
-------------------------------------------

The eastern hemisphere is east of the prime meridian and west of the International Date Line. Most of Earths landmasses, including all of Asia and Australia, and most of Africa, are part of the eastern hemisphere. The western hemisphere is west of the prime meridian and east of the International Date Line.

How many degrees of longitude are there to the east and west of the Prime Meridian?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To measure longitude east or west of the Prime Meridian, there are 180 vertical longitude lines east of the Prime Meridian and 180 vertical longitude lines west of the Prime Meridian, so longitude locations are given as \_\_ degrees east or \_\_ degrees west.

Which longitude is known as the Prime Meridian?
-----------------------------------------------

0°  
The prime meridian is the line drawn north to south at 0° (0 degrees) longitude. Sentences: The prime meridian divides Earth into the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere. The prime meridian is at 0° (0 degrees) longitude.

Which is closer east or west of the prime meridian?
---------------------------------------------------

East of this line is one day earlier than west. distance north or south of the Equator, measured in degrees. distance east or west of the prime meridian, measured in degrees. line of longitude, dividing the Earth by north-south.

How is the prime meridian related to Universal Time?
----------------------------------------------------

imaginary line around the Earth running north-south, 0 degrees longitude. museum and planetarium in Greenwich, England, that marks the prime meridian and determines Universal Time. one of Earth’s 24 divisions distinct by one hour, roughly 15 degrees of longitude. area of the Earth west of the prime meridian and east of the International Date Line.

How are the degrees of longitude in the Eastern Hemisphere measured?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Half of the world, the Eastern Hemisphere, is measured in degrees east of the prime meridian. The other half, the Western Hemisphere, in degrees west of the prime meridian. Degrees of longitude are divided into 60 minutes.

Is the prime meridian and 0 degrees latitude real?
--------------------------------------------------

Though invisible, the equator(0 degrees latitude) is a very real location that divides the world into the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The prime meridian(0 degrees longitude), on the other hand, was created by scholars who needed some point as a frame of reference to begin noting east-west points on the map.
