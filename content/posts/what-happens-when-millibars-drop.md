What happens when millibars drop?
---------------------------------

The farther the barometric pressure drops, the stronger the storm. The barometer units of measure are called millibars, meaning the atmospheric force exerted on one square meter of surface.

What does a drop in millibars mean?
-----------------------------------

When barometric pressure is stable, it is an indication of good weather. However, when the pressure quickly falls, it means a storm is on the way. The measurements on a barometer are in millibars. Drops in pressure also help indicate the strength of winds in a storm, as greater drops yield stronger winds.

What is considered low barometric pressure in millibars?
--------------------------------------------------------

A barometric reading below 29.80 inHg is generally considered low, and low pressure is associated with warm air and rainstorms. If the reading is under 29.80 inHg (100914.4 Pa or 1009.144 mb):

What is the lowest millibar hurricane?
--------------------------------------

Wilma  
The three Atlantic Basin hurricanes (all Category 5) with the lowest pressures on record are Wilma (Oct. 19, 2005, with 882 millibars or 26.05 inches of mercury), Gilbert (Sept. 14, 1988, 888 millibars or 26.22 inches) and the Labor Day Hurricane (Sept. 2, 1935, 892 millibars or 26.35 inches).

Is a barometric pressure of 30 high or low?
-------------------------------------------

A barometer reading of 30 inches (Hg) is considered normal. Strong high pressure could register as high as 30.70 inches, whereas low pressure associated with a hurricane can dip below 27.30 inches (Hurricane Andrew had a measured surface pressure of 27.23 just before its landfall in Miami Dade County).

What is considered high and low barometric pressure in millibars?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Meteorologists often express air pressure in units called “millibars.” The standard atmospheric pressure is defined as being equal to 1,013.25 millibars at sea level. In the Central Valley, 1,030 millibars and above is considered strong high pressure.

What does it mean when barometric pressure drops?
-------------------------------------------------

A falling air pressure generally means there is an approaching storm that will arrive within the next 12 to 24 hours. The farther the barometric pressure drops, the stronger the storm. Air pressure is measured with a barometer. The barometer units of measure are called millibars, meaning the atmospheric force exerted on one square meter of surface.

What does the barometric pressure of a hurricane indicate?
----------------------------------------------------------

We armchair weather watchers tend to focus on the category designation of a cyclone or the highest wind speed . However, weather professionals know the hurricane pressure scale indicates whether a hurricane is weakening or strengthening. What Is Barometric Pressure?

Why does a rising barometer indicate a falling barometer?
---------------------------------------------------------

A rising barometer indicates increasing atmospheric pressure and a falling barometer indicates decreasing atmospheric pressure. What Causes Changes in Atmospheric Pressure Changes in air pressure are caused by differences in air temperature above the earth, and the temperature of an air mass is determined by its location.

What was the lowest barometric pressure of Hurricane Camille?
-------------------------------------------------------------

When KATRINA made her second landfall, she still registered as low as 920 millibars. Hurricane CAMILLE also reached a low of 900 millibars in 1969. In 1992, Hurricane ANDREW decimated Florida, making landfall as a Category 5 storm. The lowest pressure reading of the monster storm fell to 922 millibars.
