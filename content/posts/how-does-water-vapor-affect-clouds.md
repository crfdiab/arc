How does water vapor affect clouds?
-----------------------------------

Clouds form when the invisible water vapor in the air condenses into visible water droplets or ice crystals. For this to happen, the parcel of air must be saturated, i.e. unable to hold all the water it contains in vapor form, so it starts to condense into a liquid or solid form.

What happens when clouds evaporate?
-----------------------------------

When a cloud’s temperature increases, evaporation occurs and reduces the liquid moisture content of the cloud. A cloud can be warmed by solar radiation and longwave emission from the earth’s surface. Daytime heating increases the capacity of the air to evaporate liquid water.

What is the significance of water vapor in the atmosphere?
----------------------------------------------------------

Water vapor is also the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Heat radiated from Earth’s surface is absorbed by water vapor molecules in the lower atmosphere. The water vapor molecules, in turn, radiate heat in all directions. Some of the heat returns to the Earth’s surface.

How are scientists slowing down the speed of light?
---------------------------------------------------

Illustration courtesy University of Glasgow. Light passes through air at about 299,000,000 meters per second, an accepted constant that hasn’t been challenged—until now. By manipulating a single particle of light as it passed through free space, researchers have found a way to slow down the speed of light through air.

What makes the clouds move in the wind?
---------------------------------------

Clouds are nothing but visible water vapor in the air that is the wind. Wind is air that is moving from high pressure areas to lower pressure areas. It is also air that is moving from colder to warmer and warmer to colder air masses. Air also moves due to the Coriolis Effect caused by the Earth spinning.

What’s the average speed that clouds move at?
---------------------------------------------

Go to the UCAR link to see it. The jet streams can move the very highest clouds, usually in the polar regions where they dip as low as 23,000 feet ( about 7,000 meters) and have been measured as moving as fast as 300 miles per hour ( 483 kph) over the surface. This is not normal, the average speed is closer to 125 mph. (200 kph), or less.

How does water vapor float in the air?
--------------------------------------

The molecules remain suspended since the air density is greater than that of the water vapor molecules, so they float in air, much like bodies less dense than water float in water. At higher altitudes there is less air above, and less air pressure pressing down.
