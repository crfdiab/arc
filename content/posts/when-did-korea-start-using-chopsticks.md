When did Korea start using chopsticks?
--------------------------------------

The history of chopsticks in Asia is older than many countries. They’re thought to be over 5000 years old. Originating from China, they began to spread to Japan and Korea by 500 A.D. In ancient times, chopsticks were made from trees or bamboo.
