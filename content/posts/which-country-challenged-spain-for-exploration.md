Portugal  
The history of Spanish exploration begins with the history of Spain itself. During the fifteenth century, Spain hoped to gain advantage over its rival, Portugal.

Which country competed with Spain for territory during the 1600’s?
------------------------------------------------------------------

2 Two centuries earlier the main competitors in the hemisphere had been Spain and France-for land in the Caribbean, not the North American continent. The stakes changed in the early 1600s when Britain became a contender by settling the mid Atlantic coast, right between Spanish Florida and French Canada.

Who controlled Spain in the 1500s?

Why did the Spanish Empire fall in the 1600s?
---------------------------------------------

However while Spain saw a more dramatic rise and fall in the 1600s the decline of the Spanish Empire was a slow, drawn out process that went well into the 19th century. The main reasons were that Spain rested on its laurels from its rapid success and fell behind in the race.

Who was the enemy of Spain in the 17th century?
-----------------------------------------------

In the 17th century the greatest threat had come from a land power, France, jealous of Habsburg power in Europe; in the 18th it was to come from a sea power, England, while the Austrian Habsburgs became the main continental enemy of Spain.

When did Spain become unified in the 1500s?
-------------------------------------------

Spain was unified in 1492. That is also when Columbus sails and the last moors are pushed out of Spain. Jews are expelled that same year. Countries tend to do well with strong monarchies and Spain had several “good” kings in the 1500s.

What was the problem of Spain in the 17th century?
--------------------------------------------------

Spain’s central problem in the 17th century had been to maintain what remained of its European possessions and to retain control of its American empire. At the beginning of the 18th century, both tasks appeared to be beyond the military and economic resources of the monarchy.
