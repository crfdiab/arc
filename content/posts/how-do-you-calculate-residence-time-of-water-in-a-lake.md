How do you calculate residence time of water in a lake?
-------------------------------------------------------

residence time: Tr = V/I \[T\], a measure of the average time a molecule of water spends in a reservoir. The residence time defined for steady-state systems is equal to the reservoir volume divided by the inflow or outflow rate.

What is the retention time of Lake Ontario?

What Lake has the longest water retention time?
-----------------------------------------------

Staff there used the example to explain how long water remains in Lake Superior. Its water retention/replacement rate is 191 years, by far the longest in the Great Lakes system. A later study pegged the retention time at closer to 173 years, but it’s still a big number.

What determines residence time?
-------------------------------

The residence time (lifetime) of a substance is determined with the knowledge of the amount (or concentration) of that substance and the combined rate of loss of the substance from the reservoir. Alternately, the residence time can be calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of all first order rate constants.

What is the difference between space time and residence time?
-------------------------------------------------------------

space time is the time required to process the one reactor volume of feed and the residence time is the amount of time spent by a particle until it exits the reactor.

What is the maximum depth of Lake Ontario?

Lake Ontario/Max depth

With a mean surface elevation of 243 feet (74 m) above sea level, Lake Ontario has a mean depth of 283 feet (86 m), and its deepest point is 802 feet (244 m).

How is the retention time of a lake calculated?
-----------------------------------------------

Lake retention time. Lake retention time (also called the residence time of lake water, or the water age or flushing time) is a calculated quantity expressing the mean time that water (or some dissolved substance) spends in a particular lake. At its simplest, this figure is the result of dividing the lake volume by the flow in or out…

How can I calculate the water residence time in reservoir?
----------------------------------------------------------

In a preimpoundment study the annual outflow will be more or less equal to the annual river flow at the dam site and can be used to estimate Tw, if this is not already known from the engineering studies. It may also be necessary to introduce a correction for evaporation if the lake’s surface : volume ratio is large and the climate arid.”

How is the retention time for a chart recorder calculated?
----------------------------------------------------------

The retention time is calculated according to the following equation: What is the retention time for Peaks A and B below if the chart speed was 2 cm/s? The center of peak A is at approximately 6.5 cm. Thus, the calculation is 6.5 cm/2cm/s = 3.25 s = 3 s. The center of peak B is at approximately 13.5 cm.
