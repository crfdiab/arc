What is required for an ecosystem to be successful?
---------------------------------------------------

An ecosystem must contain producers, consumers, decomposers, and dead and inorganic matter. All ecosystems require energy from an external source â€“ this is usually the sun. An ecosystem must contain producers, consumers, decomposers, and dead and inorganic matter.

Why is it important to have a good ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------

Healthy ecosystems clean our water, purify our air, maintain our soil, regulate the climate, recycle nutrients and provide us with food. Even if certain species are affected by pollution, climate change or human activities, the ecosystem as a whole may adapt and survive.

What makes an ecosystem stronger so it is more likely to survive?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Greater biodiversity in ecosystems, species, and individuals leads to greater stability. For example, species with high genetic diversity and many populations that are adapted to a wide variety of conditions are more likely to be able to weather disturbances, disease, and climate change.

Can two plants survive in an ecosystem?
---------------------------------------

Summary: Ecosystems containing many different plant species are not only more productive, they are better able to withstand and recover from climate extremes, pests and disease over long periods, according to a new study.

How does an ecosystem help a business grow?
-------------------------------------------

The integration of business-to-business ( B2B) practices, enterprise applications and data within an ecosystem allows an organization to control new and old technologies, build automated processes around them and consistently grow their business. Unmanaged, organic growth of an ecosystem can be fatal to a business.

What are the benefits of a digital ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------

Ecosystem integration creates new revenue streams and allows organizations to track and analyze wide-ranging data that flows through the business. They can use this data to create new products and services with increased value. Decreased costs with better business processes.

Why is high biodiversity important to an ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------------

High biodiversity in an ecosystem, that is a large variety of species and genes in the ecosystem contribute to a stronger ecosystem.

How are invasive species helping to restore ecosystems?
-------------------------------------------------------

The cordgrass started reappearing in the areas largely populated by green crabs, as the green crabs have taken over, driving the marsh crabs out of their burrows. While the European green crabs have wreaked havoc in many other locations, in New England they have indirectly helped restore an ecosystem ravaged by native species.
