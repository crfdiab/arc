What happens to the land after a volcanic eruption?
---------------------------------------------------

Collapsing volcanoes and underwater eruptions can also trigger devastating tsunamis that destroy land, life and property. However, nothing lasts forever, and this also applies to volcanoes. After they stop erupting, erosion can eventually wear them down over time to where they become hills or even valleys.

Do volcanic eruptions cause new land to form?
---------------------------------------------

New land is created in volcanic eruptions. These volcanoes formed from fluid lava (Figure below). The island grows as lava is added on the coast. New land may also emerge from lava that erupts from beneath the water.

How does a volcanic eruption affect the land and settlement of an area?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Many lives can be lost as a result of a volcanic eruption. If the ash and mud from a volcanic eruption mix with rain water or melting snow, fast moving mudflows are created. These flows are called lahars. Lava flows and lahars can destroy settlements and clear areas of woodland or agriculture.

How long does it take for land to recover from a volcanic eruption?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The long-term development of an ecosystem in an area impacted by a lava flow may take 1,000 to 25,000 years.

How does an eruption of a volcano affect the Earth?
---------------------------------------------------

Volcanic eruptions are among Earth’s most dramatic and powerful agents of change. Ash, mudflows, and lava flows can devastate communities near volcanoes and cause havoc in areas far downwind, downstream, and downslope. Even when a volcano is quiet, steep volcanic slopes can collapse to become landslides, and large rocks can be hurled by powerful…

When was the last time a volcano erupted in Europe?
---------------------------------------------------

On 3 July, a volcano erupted on the Italian island of Stromboli, killing one person and leading to the area being evacuated. It is one of the most active volcanoes in Europe and its last major eruption was 17 years ago. We look at why volcanoes exist in the first place, and why some erupt when others don’t.

What happens if a supervolcano eruption occurs again at Yellowstone?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

What would happen if a “supervolcano” eruption occurred again at Yellowstone? If another large, caldera-forming eruption were to occur at Yellowstone, its effects would be worldwide. Such a giant eruption would have regional effects such as falling ash and short-term (years to decades) changes to global climate.

When was the last time a volcano erupted in California?
-------------------------------------------------------

On May 22, 1915, a large explosive eruption at the summit of Lassen Peak, California, the southernmost active volcano in the Cascade Range, devastated nearby areas and rained volcanic ash as far away as 280 miles to the east. This explosion was the most powerful in a series of eruptions during 1914–17 that were the last to occur in the…
