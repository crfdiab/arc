Are there quakes on Mars \*?
----------------------------

Quakes on Earth happen many times a day, largely due to continental plates shifting as they float on the mantle below. Mars doesn’t seem to have plate tectonics, but other things can make the ground shake too, like: Cracking caused by contraction from cooling. Magma moving and creating pressure deep underground.

How many earthquakes on Mars have scientists recorded?
------------------------------------------------------

The InSight lander has recorded over 500 quakes so far (it landed in Nov. 2018), suggesting there may indeed be some volcanically active places in the Martian underground, perhaps hot molten rock (magma) moving and flowing like it does on Earth.

Are there any earthquakes on the surface of Mars?
-------------------------------------------------

The word earthquake, for example, feels universal, as if it can be applied to any shaking ground. But zoom out beyond our tectonic plates, and the vocabulary shifts. Mars, for instance, has marsquakes. They sound too silly to be real, as if a Netflix show about future Mars settlements made up a scary natural disaster.

What do they call earthquakes on other planets?
-----------------------------------------------

Even on the moon and Mars, though, seismic rumblings are still called earthquakes, because the term refers to earth in the sense of raw dirt, not Earth the name of the planet.

How are the tectonic plates different on Mars and Earth?
--------------------------------------------------------

Unlike Earth, Mars lacks tectonic plates that glide over its mantle, jostling the ground when they touch. But like Earth, Mars has three distinct layers—a rocky crust, a mantle, and a metal core—and it’s still cooling from its fiery formation out of a primordial cloud of cosmic dust.

Why are there so many quakes on Earth?
--------------------------------------

Quakes on Earth happen many times a day, largely due to continental plates shifting as they float on the mantle below. That’s called “plate tectonics.” Mars doesn’t seem to have plate tectonics, but other things can make the ground shake too, like: ​
