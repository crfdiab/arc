Why was farming along the Nile easier?
--------------------------------------

The Egyptians took advantage of the natural cyclical flooding pattern of the Nile. This yearly flooding of the river is known as inundation. As the floodwaters receded in October, farmers were left with well-watered and fertile soil in which to plant their crops.

Why would farming be difficult in areas beyond the Nile river Valley?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Nile Valley climate consists of hot summers and milder winters and there is very little rainfall. Farmers in the Nile Valley have always grown many of their crops close to the river. Around 1200 BC water stopped flowing in one of the river channels and agriculture became more difficult.

What made the Nile river valley so fertile?
-------------------------------------------

The flooding of the Nile rendered the narrow strip of land on either side of the river extremely fertile. Since rainfall is almost non-existent in Egypt, the floods provided the only source of moisture needed to sustain crops. Irrigation canals were used to control the water, particularly during dry spells.

What did farmers do in the Nile Valley?
---------------------------------------

Farming in the Nile Valley. In ancient Egypt, wealthy landowners controlled almost all the farmland. Most Egyptian farmers rented land from these landowners. In return, the landowners got a part of the crops as rent. During harvest time, farmers gathered huge amounts of wheat and barley and some vegetables, such as onions, lettuce, and beans.

Why was the Nile River important to ancient Egypt?
--------------------------------------------------

Nile River played a big role in farming because the river provided silt whenever there was a flood, so Egypt was ready for flood and they did not have to worry about the right time for farming. Also, after floods, there would be a fertile strip along the Nile River that was about 12 miles wide (Louis, and Jennifer).

What was the problem with farming in ancient Egypt?
---------------------------------------------------

Farming played a big role in city-states. However, Egypt did not have a good environment, especially the flood was the main problem. Floods destroyed villages and took many lives (David, 121). The floods sometimes caused rivers to change courses and due to this farmers had a lot of trouble with crops.

How did ancient Egypt have an easier life than Mesopotamia?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Ancient Egyptâ€™s farming system compared with Mesopotamia Ancient Egyptians had an easier life compared to the other ancient civilizations because of their reliable agriculture system. Geography played a big role, especially in farming.
