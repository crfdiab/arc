What happened after the Mount Pinatubo eruption 1991?
-----------------------------------------------------

The eruption removed so much magma and rock from beneath the volcano that the summit collapsed to form a small caldera 1.6 miles (2.5 km) across. If the huge volcanic eruption were not enough, Typhoon Yunya moved ashore at the same time with rain and high winds.

Why is equipment damaged during ash clean up?
---------------------------------------------

Wind, which stirs and billows the ash into the air, can spread ash particles over areas already cleaned, subjecting the public and cleanup personnel to even more airborne ash and exposing machinery and equipment to increase wear or damage.

Where did the eruption of Mount Pelee take place?
-------------------------------------------------

Approximately 29,000 deaths; deadliest eruption of the 20th century. The 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée was a moderately large volcanic eruption on the island of Martinique in the Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc of the eastern Caribbean. Eruptive activity began on 23 April as a series of phreatic explosions from the summit of Mount Pelée.

Who was the only survivor of Mount Pelee?
-----------------------------------------

The other survivor was a violent criminal, Louis-Auguste Cyparis. He was locked in solitary confinement in a stone cell when the volcano erupted, which, by chance, put him in the safest place in the city. As the city burned, Cyparis waited, his body covered in burns, for rescue.

What did Alfred Lacroix call the Mount Pelee eruption?
------------------------------------------------------

Alfred Lacroix, a member of the French Geological Survey who wrote the most comprehensive account of the disaster in 1904, dubbed the phenomenon a “nuée ardente,” meaning glowing or burning cloud.

Who was the most famous survivor of the St Pierre eruption?
-----------------------------------------------------------

For days afterward, St. Pierre burned. Ships in the harbor smoldered and sank. When rescuers eventually did enter the ruins, they pulled from a jail cell the most famous survivor of the disaster, Louis-Auguste Cyparis, who later toured with the Barnum and Bailey Circus.
