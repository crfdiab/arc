When did the first space walk start?

Who first walked in space?

cosmonaut Aleksei A. Leonov  
As a space walker, White had been preceded by Soviet cosmonaut Aleksei A. Leonov, who on March 18, 1965, was the first man ever to walk in space.

According to historians Rex Hall and David Shayler, Leonov’s core body temperature jumped 35° in under a half of an hour, pushing his body to the edge of heatstroke. In later interviews, Leonov described his condition inside of the suit as sloshing in sweat.

Are the astronauts still in space?
----------------------------------

There are still seven astronauts on the ISS, including a new crew of four people who arrived on a different SpaceX craft last week on a mission called Crew-2. As the capsule moved off, Mr Hopkins said: “Thanks for your hospitality. We’ll see you back on Earth.”

What was the length of the first space walk?
--------------------------------------------

The first spacewalk was 10 minutes long. Astronaut Ed White performed the first American spacewalk during the Gemini 4 mission on June 3, 1965. White’s spacewalk lasted 23 minutes. Today, spacewalks are done outside the International Space Station.

Where did the first American spacewalk take place?
--------------------------------------------------

The spacewalk started at 3:45 p.m. EDT on the third orbit when White opened the hatch and used the hand-held manuevering oxygen-jet gun to push himself out of the capsule. The EVA started over the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii and lasted 23 minutes, ending over the Gulf of Mexico.

How long does it take to do a spacewalk?
----------------------------------------

Today, spacewalks are done outside the International Space Station. Spacewalks usually last between five and eight hours, depending on the job. The world record for the most spacewalks is held by Russian astronaut Anatoly Solovyev, with a total of 16 EVAs and more than 82 hours outside in space.

Who was the Russian man who did the first spacewalk?
----------------------------------------------------

Sergey S Pozdnyakov, general director of Zvezda, which manufactures the spacesuits for Russia’s cosmonauts, says it would have been difficult to know how Leonov would react next: “The main doubt was the psychological condition of the person who was in outer space.
