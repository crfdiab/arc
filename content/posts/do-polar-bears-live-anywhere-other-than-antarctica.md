Do polar bears live anywhere other than Antarctica?
---------------------------------------------------

Polar bears live in the Arctic, near the North Pole. Penguins live on Antarctica and the neighbouring continents, near the South Pole.

Where do polar bears live in the world?
---------------------------------------

the Arctic  
Polar bears live in the Arctic, on ice-covered waters. Polar bears rely on sea ice to access the seals that are their primary source of food, as well as to rest and breed. The total polar bear population is divided into 19 units or subpopulations. Sixty percent of the sub-populations are in Canada.

Are polar bears native to Antarctica?
-------------------------------------

Q. Are there polar bears in Antarctica? No! Polar bears live in the Arctic (the North Pole) while the penguins live in Antarctica (the South Pole).

Do polar bears only live in the cold?
-------------------------------------

Inhabiting the ice and sea of the Arctic, polar bears are well-equipped for survival in a harsh environment. Two coats of fur and a thick layer of blubber help insulate the polar bear’s body from the cold, keeping its temperature at an even 37° C (98.6° F). Polar bears are also equipped with strong noses.

Why can’t polar bears live in Antarctica?
-----------------------------------------

Polar bears depend on the frozen ocean to hunt for their main sources of food: seals and walrus. For one, Antarctica is largely lacking in land predators similar to the polar bear. Without these types of predators, penguins and seals have evolved to be rather confident when hanging out above the water.

Are there polar bears in the south of Antarctica?
-------------------------------------------------

Do polar bears live in Antarctica? Polar bears live in the Arctic, but not Antarctica. Down south in Antarctica you’ll find penguins, seals, whales and all kinds of seabirds, but never polar bears. Even though the north and south polar regions both have lots of snow and ice, polar bears stick to the north.

Are there polar bears in the Arctic Circle?
-------------------------------------------

The marine life and the sea ice characteristics in both Arctic and Antarctic are almost similar. A mother polar bear actively defends her cubs even from a large dominant male polar bear. Polar bears are only found in the Arctic Circle. Do polar bears live in Antarctica? Photo by National Geographic.

Why do polar bears live at the North Pole?
------------------------------------------

Polar bears are not choosy hunters —they are opportunistic predators. It is just that their evolution occurs at far north—opposite end of the pole. One cannot assume that polar bears would migrate all the way to the south just to have the same kind of habitat and prey.

Are there any animals that live in Antarctica?
----------------------------------------------

While Antarctica is a very cold and barren place, there are many animals that call it home. One of the most famous animals that live in Antarctica is the penguins! Emperor penguins, king penguins, Adelie penguins, chinstrap penguins, and Gentoo penguins all live in Antarctica.
