How do you measure the temperature of a volcano?
------------------------------------------------

This is the direct method of measuring lava temperatures. A thermocouple probe is inserted into the flow, and the temperature is read off by a hand-held device.

Which device is used to measure very high temperature such as lava flowing from a volcano?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

thermocouples  
For very precise measurements, scientists place devices called thermocouples directly onto the hot surface of a thermal feature. Such measurements are most often made at volcanoes that are easily accessible, and scientists only conduct the measurements if the areas are safe to be in for several minutes.

What is the temperature of a volcano?
-------------------------------------

The temperature of lava when it is first ejected from a volcanic vent can vary between 700 and 1,200 degrees C (1,300 to 2,200 F).

Can you estimate the temperature of lava from its color?
--------------------------------------------------------

You can often estimate the temperature of lava by its color, she added. Yellow lava is the hottest, burning somewhere between 1,000 and 1,200 degrees Celsius (about 1,830 to 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit). Orange lava smolders between 800 and 1,000 degrees Celsius (about 1,500 to 1,830 degrees Fahrenheit).

Can a thermometer measure the temperature of a volcano?
-------------------------------------------------------

If you want to measure the temperature of something as hot as a volcano, an ordinary thermometer isnâ€™t any use.

What do you use to make a volcano erupt?
----------------------------------------

When you are ready for the eruption, pour some vinegar into the bottle (which contains hot water, dishwashing detergent, and baking soda). Make the volcano erupt again by adding more baking soda. Pour in more vinegar to trigger the reaction. By now, you probably see why it is important to use a deep dish or a pan.

Can you make a volcano erupt with baking soda?
----------------------------------------------

Hero Images/Getty Images. You can make your volcano erupt over and over again. When you are ready for the eruption, pour some vinegar into the bottle (which contains hot water, dishwashing detergent, and baking soda). Make the volcano erupt again by adding more baking soda. Pour in more vinegar to trigger the reaction.

What to do if the power goes out in a volcano?
----------------------------------------------

If the power goes out, food will stay cooler longer. Take only essential items with you, including at least a 1-week supply of prescription medications. If you have time, turn off the gas, electricity, and water. Disconnect appliances to reduce the likelihood of electrical shock when power is restored.
