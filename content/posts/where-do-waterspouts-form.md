Where do waterspouts form?
--------------------------

Waterspouts typically occur in tropical regions, but they can form almost anywhere. They can occur in the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes, western coast of Europe, Mediterranean Sea, and the Baltic Sea.

What does a water spout look like?
----------------------------------

They are sometimes seen as threatening funnel clouds descending from stormy skies. Others can be nearly invisible, like a ghostly spiral of wind skimming the sea surface. These eerie columns of rotating air are known as waterspouts — commonly defined as tornadoes over water.

Why do water spouts happen?
---------------------------

Waterspout formation typically occurs when cold air moves across the Great Lakes and results in large temperature differences between the warm water and the overriding cold air. They tend to last from about two to twenty minutes, and move along at speeds of 10 to 15 knots.

Where does the water in a waterspout come from?
-----------------------------------------------

Despite its name, a waterspout is not filled with water from the ocean or lake. A waterspout descend s from a cumulus cloud. It does not “spout” from the water. The water inside a waterspout is formed by condensation in the cloud. There are two major types of waterspouts: tornadic waterspouts and fair-weather waterspouts.

Where do waterspouts form in a fair weather storm?
--------------------------------------------------

The National Weather Service, or NWS, has identified two categories of waterspouts. • Fair weather waterspouts – These waterspouts develop from cumulus clouds. They work upward from the water’s surface, forming under light wind.

When do waterspouts occur in the Great Lakes?
---------------------------------------------

The fair weather variety of waterspout is much more common than the tornadic. Waterspouts occur most frequently in northern Michigan during the months of August, September, and October, when the waters of the Great Lakes are near their warmest levels of the year.

Are there any waterspouts in the United States?
-----------------------------------------------

Waterspouts are generally weak, so they cause little or no damage. This summer, it seems waterspouts have formed with increasing frequency. That led us here at weather.com to wonder if we’re seeing a surge in waterspouts or if, perhaps, the U.S. is a hot spot for waterspouts.
