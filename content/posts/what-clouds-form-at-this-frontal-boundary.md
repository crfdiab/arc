What types of clouds warn of an approaching warm front?
-------------------------------------------------------

Cirrus clouds are wispy, feathery, and composed entirely of ice crystals. They often are the first sign of an approaching warm front or upper-level jet streak. Unlike cirrus, cirrostratus clouds form more of a widespread, veil-like layer (similar to what stratus clouds do in low levels).

What are the last clouds you see along a warm front?
----------------------------------------------------

Nimbostratus occurs along a warm front or occluded front where the slowly rising warm air mass creates nimbostratus along with shallower stratus clouds producing less rain, these clouds being preceded by higher-level clouds such as cirrostratus and altostratus.

What does an occluded front look like?
--------------------------------------

On a weather map, shown to the left, an occluded front looks like a purple line with alternating triangles and semicircles pointing in the direction that the front is moving. It ends at a low pressure area shown with a large ‘L’ on the map, begins at the other end when cold and warm fronts connect.

What happens when there is a warm front?
----------------------------------------

Warm Front Warm fronts often bring stormy weather as the warm air mass at the surface rises above the cool air mass, making clouds and storms. Warm fronts move more slowly than cold fronts because it is more difficult for the warm air to push the cold, dense air across the Earth’s surface.

What usually happens to cause an occluded front?
------------------------------------------------

At an occluded front, the cold air mass from the cold front meets the cool air that was ahead of the warm front. The warm air rises as these air masses come together. Occluded fronts usually form around areas of low atmospheric pressure. After the front passes, the sky is usually clearer, and the air is drier.

What kind of clouds form at this frontal boundary?
--------------------------------------------------

(warm front) nimbostratus, altostratus, cirrostratus, cirrus What kind of clouds form at this frontal boundary? (warm front) cirrus What kind of clouds are at the very front edge of this boundary? (warm front) cold front Along which frontal boundary will thunderstorms develop? warm front Along which frontal boundary will all-day rain occur?

What kind of clouds are ahead of a cold front?
----------------------------------------------

Larger cumulus clouds under the higher cloud types than at a warm front, where stratocumulus and cumulus humilis usually occur. Some of these cumulus clouds may produce showers ahead of the front. Cumulonimbus and cumulus congestus producing frequent showers, with a sheet of upper altostratus, through which the sun can sometimes be seen.

What kind of weather is associated with a warm front?
-----------------------------------------------------

They are associated with warm air moving over cold air and are more likely to produce large regions of light to moderate rain, drizzle or snow. Cirrus clouds and alto cumulus, along with fog, often precede warm fronts as they move through an area. The milder weather that follows will be warmer in temperature.

What causes clouds to form in the sky?
--------------------------------------

Weather fronts can cause clouds to form. Fronts occur when two large masses of air collide at the Earth’s surface. Warm fronts produce clouds when warm air replaces cold air by sliding above it.
