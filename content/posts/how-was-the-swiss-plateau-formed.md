The country is basically divided into three main regions and they are called the Swiss Alps, the Central Plateau and the Jura.

How are glaciers formed in the Swiss Alps?
------------------------------------------

Melting snow forms fast-streaming masses of water by which stones and rock-waste are carried away and rocks slowly are grinded into round shapes. This, for instance, can be seen at the Trümmelbachfälle. Glaciers slowly slide down the mountain slope and grind new valleys.

How are landforms formed when the Earth shifts?
-----------------------------------------------

When the earth shifts, landforms such as fold mountains, volcanoes and rift valleys can occur. Volcanoes are an example of a landform that can go on to produce other landforms, such as craters, calderas and lava domes. Landforms can also occur through the process of weathering, which is the process by which sediments…

Why are the mountains in Switzerland always in motion?
------------------------------------------------------

Mountains are always in motion. Now too nature causes the Alps to change constantly. Melting snow forms fast-streaming masses of water by which stones and rock-waste are carried away and rocks slowly are grinded into round shapes. This, for instance, can be seen at the Trümmelbachfälle.
