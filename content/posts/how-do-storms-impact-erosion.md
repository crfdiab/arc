How do storms impact erosion?
-----------------------------

Storm surge “That increase in elevation allows for waves to reach higher levels on the beach and that leads to greater erosion into the dune systems.” If the surge comes on top of the high tide or from an unusual direction there is even greater damage.

Is there erosion after a storm?
-------------------------------

Dune erosion occurs when storm surge elevates waves higher on the beach, allowing them to attack and erode the coastal dune. As sand is removed from the dune, the front face becomes very steep, or scarped.

What kind of damage can occur from hurricanes?
----------------------------------------------

When a hurricane strikes a coastal area, it brings a number of serious hazards. These hazards include heavy rains, high winds, a storm surge, and even tornadoes. Storm surge pushes seawater on shore during a hurricane, flooding towns near the coast. Heavy rains cause flooding in inland places as well.

How do hurricanes affect the landscape?
---------------------------------------

Hurricanes generate strong winds that can completely remove leaves from forest canopies and cause dramatic changes in structure in wooded ecosystems. Animals can either be killed by hurricanes or impacted indirectly through changes in habitat and food availability caused by high winds, storm surge, and rainfall.

How does a hurricane affect the coastal environment?
----------------------------------------------------

Hurricane Impacts on the Coastal Environment. The resulting damage in south Florida, Louisiana, Guam, and Hawaii was in the tens of billions of dollars. Hurricanes and extreme extratropical storms cause elevated sea level, known as storm surge, and extensive shoreline erosion and other geologic effects leading to the loss of property and life.

How does erosion affect the environment and water?
--------------------------------------------------

Eroded soil, which can contain nutrients, fertilisers and herbicides or pesticides, can be deposited where there is a reduction in the slope of the land. This can be in sediment traps, along contour banks, or in grassed waterways, dams or wetlands.

How are the sand dunes affected by Hurricane Irma?
--------------------------------------------------

The low-lying sand spit near the top of the image overwashed due to high surge and waves while the dunes to the south show scarping indicative of dune erosion. Predicted probabilities of dune erosion and overwash were 98% and 73% for this location.

What can scientists do to prevent hurricane damage?
---------------------------------------------------

USGS scientists plan studies of the high-energy processes responsible for storm damage. In order to help mitigate the impacts caused by hurricanes such as Andrew and Iniki, environmental managers and engineers must understand the geological processes that cause erosion and environmental change.
