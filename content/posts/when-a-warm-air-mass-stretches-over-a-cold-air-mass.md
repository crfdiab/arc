When a warm air mass stretches over a cold air mass?
----------------------------------------------------

Another type of frontal development is called an occlusion or occluded front. It is formed when a warm air mass, lying between two cold air masses, is lifted up by the cold air mass behind it. The rapidly lifted warm air cools and creates a low sometimes causing severe precipitation to occur.

What happens when two warm air masses meet?
-------------------------------------------

When two air masses meet together, the boundary between the two is called a weather front. At a front, the two air masses have different densities, based on temperature, and do not easily mix. One air mass is lifted above the other, creating a low pressure zone.

When a fast moving cold air mass overtakes a slower warm air mass?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Cold front: a fast-moving cold air mass overtakes a warm air mass; the warm air is pushed upward. Warm front: a warm air mass overtakes a slow-moving cold air mass; warm air moves over the cold air.

What happens when one air mass overtakes another air mass?
----------------------------------------------------------

One air mass is lifted above the other, creating a low pressure zone. If the lifted air is moist, there will be condensation and precipitation. Winds are common at a front. The greater the temperature difference between the two air masses, the stronger the winds will be.

What happens when air masses move suddenly?
-------------------------------------------

Cold fronts often bring sudden changes in the weather. When a warm air mass runs into a cold air mass it creates a warm front. The warm air mass is moving faster than the cold air mass, so it flows up over the cold air mass. As the warm air rises, it cools, resulting in clouds and sometimes light precipitation.

What happens when warm and cold air masses move?
------------------------------------------------

The leading edge of a warm air mass advancing into a region occupied by a cold air mass is called a warm front. A cold front occurs when a cold air mass advances into a region occupied by a warm air mass. If the boundary between the cold and warm air masses doesn’t move, it is called a stationary front.

What happens when cooler air collides with warmer air?
------------------------------------------------------

However, if cooler air approaches and collides with warmer air, the heavy, denser cool air will tend to undercut the warmer air, pushing it rather like a bulldozer, forming a steeply rising front. The name of each front is derived from the type of air which follows behind it at ground level.

What happens to the air as a warm front approaches?
---------------------------------------------------

As the warm front approaches, there may be fog or increasing rainfall, and thunderstorms may form, as well. This is due to the (usually) higher humidity in the air of warm fronts compared to that of cold fronts.

What’s the temperature of a warm air mass?
------------------------------------------

Good question! Unfortunately, the definition of “warm air mass” is a bit vague. It simply implies that the air is warmer than the surrounding air, and the surface that it is moving over. In general, I would define a “warm air mass” as one which is about 20 degrees warmer than the air surrounding it.
