What body of water connects the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean in South America?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drake Passage  
Drake Passage, deep waterway, 600 miles (1,000 km) wide, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans between Cape Horn (the southernmost point of South America) and the South Shetland Islands, situated about 100 miles (160 km) north of the Antarctic Peninsula.

How is the Pacific Ocean connected to the Atlantic Ocean?
---------------------------------------------------------

The Pacific Ocean is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by a 48-mile waterway in Panama known as the Panama Canal. Panama is the narrowest landmass between the two oceans, and the canal consists of three locks and dams enabling the passage of ships from the Port of Cristobal on the Atlantic side to the Port of Balboa on the Pacific.

How long is the canal from the Atlantic to the Pacific?
-------------------------------------------------------

Before the canal was opened in 1914 ships had to travel around the southern tip of South America to get from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. The Panama Canal shortens the journey by about 11000 km. The Panama Canal is 82 km long. Ships travel through the waterway through a system of locks.

Why was the Panama Canal important to the Atlantic Ocean?
---------------------------------------------------------

The canal greatly reduced the time taken by ships to cross from the Pacific to the Atlantic. Its construction is considered one of the largest and the most complicated engineering projects ever undertaken. However, the Panama Canal is not the only waterway connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific.

Where does the Atlantic Ocean water come from?
----------------------------------------------

The Atlantic Creek water flows for approximately 3,490 miles to the Atlantic Ocean through Yellowstone River which empties the waters into the Gulf of Mexico via Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.
