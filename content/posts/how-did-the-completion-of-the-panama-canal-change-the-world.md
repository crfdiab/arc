How did the completion of the Panama Canal change the world?
------------------------------------------------------------

Considered one of the wonders of the modern world, the Panama Canal opened for business 100 years ago this Friday, linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and providing a new route for international trade and military transport.

How did the Panama Canal shorten trips?
---------------------------------------

Before the canal was opened in 1914 ships had to travel around the southern tip of South America to get from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. The Panama Canal shortens the journey by about 11000 km. Ships travel through the waterway through a system of locks.

Why is the Panama Canal important for travel today?
---------------------------------------------------

The canal permits shippers of commercial goods, ranging from automobiles to grain, to save time and money by transporting cargo more quickly between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Did Panama Canal reduce travel time?
------------------------------------

The wider Panama Canal will also considerably reduce travel time from the U.S. Gulf Coast to South America, declining from 20 days to 8-9 days to Chilean regasification terminals, and from 25 days to 5 days to prospective terminals in Colombia and Ecuador.

How did the Panama Canal change the world?
------------------------------------------

In the world history of transportation, probably no other infrastructure creation has been greater than the construction and operation of the behemoth Panama Canal. It has not only altered the course of history, but in so doing has enabled goods to be transported from one part of the world to another.

How long does it take a ship to pass through the Panama Canal?
--------------------------------------------------------------

In 2017 it took ships an average of 11.38 hours to pass between the canalâ€™s two locks. The American Society of Civil Engineers has ranked the Panama Canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world.

When was the third lane of the Panama Canal built?
--------------------------------------------------

The original locks are 34 m (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, neo-Panamax ships, capable of handling more cargo.

Who was the US President when the Panama Canal was signed?
----------------------------------------------------------

On September 7, 1977, the treaty was signed by President of the United States Jimmy Carter and Omar Torrijos, de facto leader of Panama. This mobilized the process of granting the Panamanians free control of the canal so long as Panama signed a treaty guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of the canal.
