Why is California at higher risk for earthquakes?
-------------------------------------------------

The San Andreas fault marks the boundary where the North American tectonic plate and the Pacific plate grind past each other. As the Pacific plate inches along a northwesterly route, stresses build until the ground breaks, which sends the surface rolling in an earthquake.

What is the major fault that defines the earthquakes in California?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pacific Plate (on the west) moves northwestward relative to the North American Plate (on the east), causing earthquakes along the fault. The San Andreas is the “master” fault of an intricate fault network that cuts through rocks of the California coastal region.

What fault line is California on?
---------------------------------

San Andreas Fault  
The San Andreas Fault is a continental transform fault that extends roughly 1,200 kilometers (750 mi) through California. It forms the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, and its motion is right-lateral strike-slip (horizontal).

Are there any known fault lines in California?
----------------------------------------------

A. There are thousands of known faults in California, and scientists continue to discover new ones. Since earthquakes can happen anywhere in California, damage to your home and personal property is always possible. Check to see earthquake risk near you and take steps to get prepared!

What are the risks of earthquakes in California?
------------------------------------------------

Very large earthquakes that occur closer to the Northern California coast could cause damaging levels of ground shaking here too. Even moderate shaking can damage seismically-vulnerable structures and trigger landslides that could quickly block roads and highways. Soils in lowland areas away from major faults may be subject to liquefaction.

How big is the San Andreas Fault in California?
-----------------------------------------------

The San Andreas fault system is the major geologic boundary between the North American and Pacific tectonic plates and passes through much of the state. It will create the biggest earthquakes—as big as magnitude 8—that will disrupt the whole region. But smaller magnitude earthquakes can also cause damaging levels of ground shaking.

Is there a chance of an earthquake in San Francisco?
----------------------------------------------------

Scientists predict that within a 30-year period (beginning in 2014), there’s a 51 percent chance that the San Francisco region specifically will experience one or more magnitude-7.0 or greater earthquakes.
