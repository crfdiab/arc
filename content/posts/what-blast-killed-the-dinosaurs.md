What blast killed the dinosaurs?
--------------------------------

The Chicxulub crater lends support to the theory postulated by the late physicist Luis Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups, including non-avian dinosaurs, may have resulted from a bolide impact (the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event).

What made the dinosaurs die?
----------------------------

Evidence suggests an asteroid impact was the main culprit. Volcanic eruptions that caused large-scale climate change may also have been involved, together with more gradual changes to Earth’s climate that happened over millions of years.

What killed the dinosaurs a comet or asteroid?
----------------------------------------------

(CNN) Dinosaurs might have been wiped out by a comet instead of an asteroid, a new study says. Harvard researchers theorized that a piece of a comet crashed into Earth over 66 million years ago to create the Chicxulub crater, according to a study published Monday in Scientific Reports.

How did the dinosaurs die in a volcano?
---------------------------------------

Volcanoes probably helped kill the dinosaurs. But scientists don’t agree how. Mist-shrouded Mongolian Saurolophus gather at dawn, as seen in a painting. Non-avian dinosaurs died out 66 million years ago in a cataclysm probably driven by a large asteroid impact.

What was the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs?
------------------------------------------------

Their research appears in the Feb. 22 issue of the journal Science. “Everyone has heard that the dinosaurs died from an asteroid hitting the Earth,” said Schoene, an associate professor of geosciences.

How did the non avian dinosaurs die out?
----------------------------------------

Non-avian dinosaurs died out 66 million years ago in a cataclysm probably driven by a large asteroid impact. Now, two studies help to clarify how huge volcanoes erupting at the same time could have also played a role. Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. What actually killed the dinosaurs?

How did dinosaurs go extinct 66 million years ago?
--------------------------------------------------

A new study by Yale researchers puts the blame squarely on the asteroid impact. About 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, 75% of life on earth went extinct.
