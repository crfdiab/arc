Which is the farthest north south south and West?
-------------------------------------------------

Determining which state is the farthest north, south, east, and west in the United States depends on your perspective. Are you looking at all 50 states or just the lower 48 contiguous states? Are you considering the way it looks on a map or judging by the lines of latitude and longitude ?

Which is the northernmost state in the lower 48?
------------------------------------------------

Much of the US/Canada border is set at the 49th parallel. Look closely at Minnesota, and you will notice that a small part of the state juts out northward. Know as Angle Inlet, this region is at 49 degrees 23 minutes north, making it the northernmost point in the lower 48.

Which is the southernmost state in the United States?
-----------------------------------------------------

On a globe, you can get a better sense for how far out in the Pacific Ocean the state is. At 18 degrees 55 minutes north, Ka Lae on the Big Island of Hawaii is the southernmost point in the US. Take Hawaii away however, and Florida is left as the southernmost point.

Farthest North When looking at the entire US, it becomes pretty obvious which state is the farthest north: Alaska for the win. Point Barrow, Alaska, is the northernmost point, located at 71 degrees 23 minutes north. It becomes less obvious, however, when you are just considering the 48 contiguous states.

Which is the northernmost state in New England?
-----------------------------------------------

Take a look at how the Census groups the 50 states — and decide whether you agree with where your state ended up. The Northeast. The Northeast includes Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. New England is the northernmost part of the Northeast New England.

Which is the farthest north in the United States?
-------------------------------------------------

On the U.S. mainland, it is Cape Sable, Florida (25 degrees 7 minutes north.) It may appear on the map that Maine is farther north than Minnesota. However, the Angle Inlet of northern Minnesota at 49 degrees 23 minutes north is north of the 49-degree boundary between the United States and Canada.

Which is the farthest state in the lower 48 states?
---------------------------------------------------

Farthest Points in the Lower 48 States If you’re considering only the 48 contiguous states, then we eliminate Alaska and Hawaii from the equation. The easternmost state is Maine, marked by the West Quoddy Head Lighthouse (66 degrees 57 minutes west.) The northernmost state is Minnesota at Angle Inlet (49 degrees 23 minutes north.)
