What type of cycle is the Jewish calendar based on?
---------------------------------------------------

Metonic cycle  
The Jewish calendar is based on the Metonic cycle of 19 years, of which 12 are common (non-leap) years of 12 months and 7 are leap years of 13 months. To determine whether a Jewish year is a leap year, one must find its position in the 19-year Metonic cycle.

Why is the Jewish calendar different?
-------------------------------------

Sun, moon, and holy scripture. Corresponding with all of the lunisolar calendars means that the Jewish calendar is in sync with the natural cycles of the moon and the sun. These astronomical phenomena helped determine the length of a day, month, and year. For example, days are set by the rotation of the Earth’s axis.

The Jewish calendar is based on the Metonic cycle of 19 years, of which 12 are common (non-leap) years of 12 months and 7 are leap years of 13 months. To determine whether a Jewish year is a leap year, one must find its position in the 19-year Metonic cycle.

How many months are there in a Jewish year?
-------------------------------------------

Months in the Jewish Calendar A year in the Hebrew calendar can be 353, 354, 355, 383, 384, or 385 days long. Regular common years have 12 months with a total of 354 days. Leap years have 13 months and are 384 days long.

How often is a leap month added to the Jewish calendar?
-------------------------------------------------------

Each month begins with the appearance of a Crescent Moon after the New Moon phase and lasts for a full lunation, a Moon cycle encompassing all phases of the Moon. Since the sum of 12 lunar months is about 11 days shorter than a solar year, a leap month is added every 2 to 3 years, or 7 times in a 19-year cycle.
