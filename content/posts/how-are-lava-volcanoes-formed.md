How are lava volcanoes formed?
------------------------------

A volcano is formed when hot molten rock, ash and gases escape from an opening in the Earth’s surface. The molten rock and ash solidify as they cool, forming the distinctive volcano shape shown here. As a volcano erupts, it spills lava that flows downslope. Hot ash and gases are thrown into the air.

Where does the lava in a volcano come from?
-------------------------------------------

Lava (which as you undoubtedly know, is partially molten rock erupted by volcanoes) typically comes from the mantle—the Earth’s middle layer, sandwiched between the crust and the core. Once it reaches the surface, lava quickly cools down and solidifies completely, creating new land.

How are volcanoes and lava formed and how are they formed?
----------------------------------------------------------

Lava is magma that has reached the surface. Magma can be formed from the subduction and melting of cold, dense, wet oceanic crust at some convergent plate margins. The moisture in the rock assists in the melting of the crust and the rock surrounding it.

How are the volcanoes of Hawaii and Iceland formed?
---------------------------------------------------

The Hawaiian volcanic chain is a series of shield cones, and they are common in Iceland, as well. Lava domes are built by slow eruptions of highly viscous lava. They are sometimes formed within the crater of a previous volcanic eruption, as in the case of Mount Saint Helens, but can also form independently, as in the case of Lassen Peak.

How are volcanoes formed and how are they dangerous?
----------------------------------------------------

Formation of the volcanic eruption can be dangerous because a mixture of hot gases, molten rocks, and solid fragments is pushed to the surface from the depths. As they cool down, they form a conical peak of the volcano, with an indentation in the center.

When does lava reach the surface of the Earth?
----------------------------------------------

However, at times when the pressure is not enough it doesn’t reach the surface. When the molten material reaches the earth surface, it is referred to as the lava. Simply put, volcanoes form when the hot molten materials beneath the earth rise and escape into the crust.
