Which microorganism is used in cleaning environment?
----------------------------------------------------

Natural cleaners Scientists have achieved considerable success in using fungi species such as Asper-gillus niger, A terreus, Cladosporium oxysporum and Mucor thermohyalospora to break down endosulphan, a highly toxic insecticide, into a non-toxic isomer.

How are microorganisms helpful to the environment?
--------------------------------------------------

The most significant effect of the microbes on earth is their ability to recycle the primary elements that make up all living systems, especially carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen (N). Thus along with all these benefits, microbes greatly contribute in maintaining sustainability of environment.

Does bacteria help clean the environment?
-----------------------------------------

Microbes represent an effective tool for bioremediation and for clean-up environment. They can degrade almost all types of pollutants, heavy metals, industrial effluents, xenobiotics, and other recalcitrant molecules of complex nature.

How do microorganisms act as a cleaning agent of nature?
--------------------------------------------------------

Answer: Many microorganisms decompose the dead organic waste of plants and animals into simpler and harmless substance. Such Similar substance got into the soil and used by other plants. Thus, microorganisms act as the cleaning agent of the nature.

How Putrifying bacterias are helpful in cleaning the environment?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Putrefying/decay bacteria are bacteria involved in putrefaction of living matter. Along with other decomposers, they play a critical role in recycling nitrogen from dead organisms.

How is bacteria harmful to the environment?
-------------------------------------------

For example, bacteria break down dead matter in the environment, like dead leaves, releasing carbon dioxide and nutrients in the process. Without the release of carbon dioxide, plants are unable to grow.

What are the harmful microorganisms?
------------------------------------

Harmful microorganisms include fungi, bacteria, protozoa, etc. The harmful microorganisms not only damage the human body but also the food we eat. Such disease-causing microorganisms are called pathogens. Some of the common diseases affecting humans are cholera, common cold, chicken pox and tuberculosis.

How do microorganisms spoil food very short answer?
---------------------------------------------------

8.5. Microbial spoilage is caused by microorganisms like fungi (moulds, yeasts) and bacteria. They spoil food by growing in it and producing substances that change the colour, texture and odour of the food. Eventually the food will be unfit for human consumption.
