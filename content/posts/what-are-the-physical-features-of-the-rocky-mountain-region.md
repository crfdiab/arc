What are the physical features of the Rocky mountain region?
------------------------------------------------------------

Although lying at a lower elevation than the towering Rockies, the plateau sits at a higher elevation than the Great Plains in the eastern portion of the state and also harbors a more diverse landscape. Features of this arid land include tablelands, buttes, mesas, dry gullies, deep canyons and shallow basins.

What are the physical features of the Canadian Rockies?
-------------------------------------------------------

The Canadian Rockies are quite different in appearance and geology from the American Rockies to the south of them. The Canadian Rockies are composed of layered sedimentary rock such as limestone and shale, whereas the American Rockies are made mostly of metamorphic and igneous rock such as gneiss and granite.

Where are the Rockies and the Rocky Mountains located?
------------------------------------------------------

The Rocky Mountains are a large mountain range located in the western part of North America in the United States and Canada. The Rockies as they are also known, pass through northern New Mexico and into Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.

What are the physical characteristics of the Rocky Mountains?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Land Was Carved by Lakes and Rivers. The dramatic terrain of Rocky Mountain National Park was carved by running water and massive glaciers, so it’s no surprise that the park still contains 147 lakes and 450 miles of streams.

How are the Rocky Mountains related to the Cordilleras?
-------------------------------------------------------

The Rocky Mountains are part of a system of parallel mountain ranges known as the Cordilleras. A cordillera is a long series of mountain ranges. Although cordilleras exist all over the world, in North America, “the Cordilleras” indicate the massive mountain ranges in the western part of the continent.

What are the main bodies of water in the Rocky Mountains?
---------------------------------------------------------

The Rocky Mountain Trench seperates the main geological body of the Canadian Rockies and the additional Columbia Mountain group. The Rocky Mountain Trench drains into several of the main rivers, such as the Peace River, Kootney River, Fraser River, and Columbia River.
