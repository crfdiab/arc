How does baking soda and vinegar react?
---------------------------------------

Baking soda and vinegar react with each other because they exchange atoms. In this reaction, baking soda acts as a base, and takes a proton from vinegar, which is an acid. The reaction releases gas because when the baking soda receives the proton, it transforms into water and carbon dioxide.

Why does baking soda and vinegar react?
---------------------------------------

If enough vinegar is used, all of the baking soda can be made to react and disappear into the vinegar solution. The reaction is: Sodium bicarbonate and acetic acid reacts to carbon dioxide, water and sodium acetate.

Can you use brown vinegar for volcano?
--------------------------------------

Try using regular brown vinegar or some lemon juice on your Ice Volcano.

How do you make a volcano erupt with baking soda and vinegar?
-------------------------------------------------------------

When you are ready for the eruption, pour some vinegar into the bottle (which contains hot water, dishwashing detergent, and baking soda). Make the volcano erupt again by adding more baking soda. Pour in more vinegar to trigger the reaction. By now, you probably see why I said to use a deep dish or a pan.

How can I Make my volcano erupt again?
--------------------------------------

You can make your volcano erupt over and over again. When you are ready for the eruption, pour some vinegar into the bottle (which contains hot water, dishwashing detergent, and baking soda). Make the volcano erupt again by adding more baking soda.

What do you use to make a volcano?
----------------------------------

Mix together 3 cups flour, 1 cup salt, 1 cup water, and 2 tablespoons of cooking oil. Either work the dough with your hands or stir it with a spoon until the mixture is smooth. If you like, you can add a few drops of food coloring to the dough to make it volcano-colored.

How does baking soda and vinegar react to form water?
-----------------------------------------------------

Acids contain the other H, one hydrogen. These really like to join and form water, so they break away from the acid and base to react. In our case, baking soda is sodium bicarbonate (a base) and vinegar is diluted acetic acid. When they react to release the OH and H to become water, they also release carbon dioxide.
