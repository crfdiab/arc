What percentage of prisoners serving time will eventually be released back into society?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the fact that 95% of all inmates will eventually return to the community,9 the prison population has a direct impact on offender reentry. As the prison population grows, increasing numbers of ex-offenders are released from correctional facilities.

What is the most expensive community based program?

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    How often are prisoners actually granted parole?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    Any inmate serving a set term, e.g. 10 years, will normally be granted parole after a certain percentage of their sentence is completed. This percentage is set by law in that state. Few inmates serve 100% of their sentence. These inmates receive parole on the completion of their sentence.
    
    How many people are serving life without parole?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    Many other states have Truth in Sentencing statutes in place, which means individuals are not eligible for parole until they have almost completed their sentences. And at least six states have almost a quarter of their incarcerated population serving life without parole, or sentences so long that they amount to virtual life.
    
    How does parole supervision affect the release rate?
    ----------------------------------------------------

    How many states have abolished discretionary parole?
    ----------------------------------------------------
    
    Sixteen states have abolished or severely curtailed discretionary parole, and the remaining states range from having a system of presumptive parole — where when certain conditions are met, release on parole is guaranteed — to having policies and practices that make earning release almost impossible.
