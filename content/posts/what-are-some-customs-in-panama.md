    What do you need to know about dating in Panama?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    Let’s get to dating in Panama. Before breaking down this list of 10 things you should know, I think it’s important to say that I know what a lot of people are expecting me to add to the list. It’s no secret that men (and women) have moved to Panama and have been swindled by some money-hungry, gold-digging lover. It happens.

    Life in Panama is different, and by acting the way we did back home, we can sometimes ostracize ourselves. Now, for single people moving to Panama, and maybe even some Panamanians in the dating game, I hope this article gives you some new insight on the mixing and mingling world of love and new friendships.
    
    Is it easy to find men in Panama?
    ---------------------------------
    
    If you turn to the world of online dating, it’s easy to find Latinas searching for wealthy men, Russian mail order brides, Asian seductresses, and American escorts all looking for a buck. It happens everywhere and definitely isn’t unique to Panama. And it’s not unique to women.
    
    Is it true that I am married to a Panamanian woman?
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    Totally true. I have been married to my Panamanian wife, Marlene, for a long time. However, both Marlene and I, have worked in Panama. We’ve been around young singles and not-so-young singles, and we’ve heard all the stories, all the complaints, and all the expectations.
