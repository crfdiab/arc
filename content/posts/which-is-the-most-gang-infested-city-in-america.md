Although gangs aren’t often talked about in many cities in which they aren’t prevalent, in those where the groups run around town and cause violence, they are a real concern.

Also, the gangs in Detroit are unique in that they don’t have any specific affiliations.

Being close to the Canadian border also makes Detroit a major trafficking hub, and thus furthers the gang activity in the city.
