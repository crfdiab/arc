Do plants grow in the Mariana Trench?
-------------------------------------

Due to no light being able to reach the trench and therefore no plants can grow, there are bacteria doing chemosynthesis: when certain microbes create energy by chemical reactions.

What types of plants live in the deep sea?
------------------------------------------

Let’s discuss the four common types of floating and rooted plants that live in the ocean:

- Kelp. Kelp beds are commonly found throughout colder ocean waters.
- Red Algae. Red algae have populated the warm, tropical waters of the world for more than 500 million years.
- Seagrass.
- Sargassum.

How do plants survive in the Mariana Trench?
--------------------------------------------

Sunlight, water and carbon dioxide are necessary for plants to live. But ocean plants do not have extensive root systems, nor are they exposed to air. Instead, they have adapted to absorb all the water and carbon dioxide they need from the water they live in.

What is living in Mariana Trench?
---------------------------------

While exploring the Sirena Deep portion of the trench with a robotic lander, scientists found what they believe is evidence of a thriving microbial community clinging to the rocks in the abyss. Microbes and larger organisms, such as shrimp-like amphipods, have been found in the mud of the Mariana Trench before.

Are there plants at the bottom of the ocean?
--------------------------------------------

From 1,000 meters below the surface, all the way to the sea floor, no sunlight penetrates the darkness; and because photosynthesis can’t take place, there are no plants, either. Animals that live in the abyssal zone feed on detritus raining down from above—or on each other.

What was found in the Mariana Trench?
-------------------------------------

A recent study revealed that a plastic bag, like the kind given away at grocery stores, is now the deepest known piece of plastic trash, found at a depth of 10,975 meters (36,000 feet) inside the Mariana Trench.

What kind of fish live in the Mariana Trench?
---------------------------------------------

Crabs and Angler Fish are but few of the many species of the Mariana Trench. One mud sample taken from Challenger Deep by Oceanographers from the Kaiko yielded nearly over 200 different microorganisms.

Are there any microorganisms on the Mariana Trench?
---------------------------------------------------

One mud sample taken from Challenger Deep by Oceanographers from the Kaiko yielded nearly over 200 different microorganisms. Although there seems to be an abundance of life at these depths, no human being could withstand the pressure extremes.

How big is the Mariana Trench in feet?
--------------------------------------

A diver found several plastic bags and candy wrappers in the Mariana Trench in 2019, at 35,849 feet under the big ocean. It means that humans have already started to contaminate the deepest part of the sea even before we are explorable.

Are there sea cucumbers in the Marianas Trench?
-----------------------------------------------

Small balls of sediment, which have tentatively been idenfied as a species of amoeba known as Gromia sphaerica. NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research/2016 Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas But the sea cucumbers are not alone on the seabed.
