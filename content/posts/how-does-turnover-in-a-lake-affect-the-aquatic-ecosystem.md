How does turnover in a lake affect the aquatic ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------------------

Twice a year, unseen forces churn water from the depths of our deeper lakes and deliver oxygen and nutrients essential to aquatic life. This temperature-driven process of lake “turnover” allows aquatic life to inhabit the entirety of the lake as oxygen becomes more available.

How do seasons affect aquatic ecosystems?
-----------------------------------------

Changes in seasonal patterns of precipitation and runoff will alter hydrologic characteristics of aquatic systems, affecting species composition and ecosystem productivity. Changes in the seasonal timing of snowmelt will alter stream flows, potentially interfering with the reproduction of many aquatic species.

What happens when lake turns over?
----------------------------------

Lake turnover is the process of a lake’s water turning over from top (epilimnion) to bottom (hypolimnion). During the fall, the warm surface water begins to cool. As water cools, it becomes more dense, causing it to sink. This dense water forces the water of the hypolimnion to rise, “turning over” the layers.

At what temperature does a lake turnover?
-----------------------------------------

50 to 55 degrees F.  
This mixing occurs when the surface temperature of lakes reaches 50 to 55 degrees F. When the lake’s water reaches this temperature, the surface water becomes denser than the other water in the lake’s water column.

Why does lake turnover occur in the summer?
-------------------------------------------

Simply put, lake turnover is the seasonal mixing of the entire water column. For many lakes deeper than about 20 feet, distinct, thermally stratified layers of water form during the summer. These layers prevent the lake from mixing and aerating. Warmer and less dense water floats on the top of cooler, denser water at the bottom.

How does dissolved oxygen affect fish behaviour New Zealand?
------------------------------------------------------------

In summer, when the water temperature increases, river fish will hold in deeper, shaded areas where the water is colder, areas where cooler side streams enter the main river, in pockets of cooler water or in riffly water as this is where the dissolved oxygen levels are higher.

What happens to the water in a lake?
------------------------------------

Lake Turnover. Lake turnover is the seasonal movement of water in a lake. Shallow lakes experience very little lake turnover, while large, deep lakes experience major changes as waters of different temperatures mix.

How does dissolved oxygen affect the quality of water?
------------------------------------------------------

A dissolved oxygen level that is too high or too low can harm aquatic life and affect water quality. Dissolved oxygen is the presence of these free O2 molecules within water. The bonded oxygen molecule in water (H2O) is in a compound and does not count toward dissolved oxygen levels.
