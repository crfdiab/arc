What converts nitrates to free nitrogen?
----------------------------------------

Denitrification by bacteria converts nitrates (NO3−) to nitrogen gas (N2). Nitrification by bacteria converts nitrates (NO3−) to nitrites (NO2−). Nitrogen fixing bacteria convert nitrogen gas (N2) into organic compounds.

Which bacteria helps in conversion of nitrogen into nitrate?
------------------------------------------------------------

The bacteria that we are talking about are called nitrosomonas and nitrobacter. Nitrobacter turns nitrites into nitrates; nitrosomonas transform ammonia to nitrites.

How is nitrate in the soil converted back to nitrogen gas?
----------------------------------------------------------

Turning nitrate back into nitrogen gas, the process of denitrification, happens through the work of denitrifying bacteria. These bacteria often live in swamps and lakes. They take in the nitrate and release it back to the atmosphere as nitrogen gas.

What converts ammonia to nitrates?
----------------------------------

Nitrification. Nitrification is the process that converts ammonia to nitrite and then to nitrate and is another important step in the global nitrogen cycle. Most nitrification occurs aerobically and is carried out exclusively by prokaryotes.

What bacteria converts ammonia to nitrates?
-------------------------------------------

The nitrification process requires the mediation of two distinct groups: bacteria that convert ammonia to nitrites (Nitrosomonas, Nitrosospira, Nitrosococcus, and Nitrosolobus) and bacteria that convert nitrites (toxic to plants) to nitrates (Nitrobacter, Nitrospina, and Nitrococcus).

What is nitrogen converted to by soil bacteria?
-----------------------------------------------

Adapting to their environment Nitrogen-fixing bacteria contain an enzyme complex called nitrogenase which catalyses the conversion of nitrogen gas to ammonia.

Which bacteria is responsible for nitrification?
------------------------------------------------

How long does it take for ammonia to turn into nitrite?
-------------------------------------------------------

4 to 6 weeks  
Beneficial bacteria is needed to take toxic fish waste called ammonia and convert it into nitrite and nitrate. Growing this beneficial bacteria takes time! It may take 4 to 6 weeks for the process to complete.

How are nitrates converted to nitrogen in the soil?
---------------------------------------------------

Nitrifying bacteria in the soil convert ammonia into nitrite (NO2-) and then into nitrate (NO3-). Step 1- Nitrogen Fixation- Special bacteria convert the nitrogen gas.

What kind of bacteria convert nitrogen to nitrite?
--------------------------------------------------

Nitrogen cycle – Lenntech Nitrosomonas bacteria first convert nitrogen gas to nitrite (NO2-) and. Ncan be converted directly into NO3- through processes that exert a. First, the soil bacteria Nitrosomonas and Nitrococcus convert NHto NO2-, and then.

How is nitrogen returned to the soil after decomposition?
---------------------------------------------------------

Decomposers break down the bodies of dead organisms, urine and faeces resulting in nitrogen being returned to the soil as ammonia. This ammonia is converted to nitrates by nitrifying bacteria. In some conditions denitrifying bacteria in the soil break down nitrates and return nitrogen back to the air. This is usually in waterlogged soil.

What happens to nitrite in the nitrogen cycle?
----------------------------------------------

Nitrifying bacteria in the soil convert ammonia into nitrite (NO2-) and then into nitrate (NO3-). This process is called nitrification. Compounds such as nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and ammonium can be taken up from soils by plants and then used in the formation of plant and animal proteins.
