Why is the Tg of PVC higher than polyethylene?
----------------------------------------------

in the polymer chain reduces the flexibility of the chain, leading to higher glass transition temperature. it stiffer (hence higher Tg) than polyethylene adipate (bottom molecular chain).

What is the Tg of polyethylene?
-------------------------------

The values of Tg are given below for the major plastics….

<table><tr><th>Name of plastic</th><th>Tg</th></tr><tr><td>Polyethylene</td><td>-125�C</td></tr><tr><td>Polypropylene</td><td>0�C</td></tr><tr><td>Polyvinyl chloride</td><td>87�C</td></tr><tr><td>Polystyrene</td><td>100�C</td></tr></table>

Why TC is between TG and TM?
----------------------------

The key difference between TG and TM polymers is that the TG of polymers describes the conversion of the glassy state into rubbery state whereas the TM of polymers describes the conversion of the crystalline state into an amorphous state.

Which polymer has higher Tg?
----------------------------

These types of interactions increase the rigidity of polymeric material therefore increase the glass transition temperature. Polyvinyl chloride has higher Tg than polyethylene and Nylon-6 also has higher transition point than polyolefin.

What is Tg value?
-----------------

The Tg value is the temperature at which amorphous polymers change from hard to soft. The concentration of crystalline regions in amorphous (semicrystalline) polymers affects the rigidity of the polymer. The crystalline melting temperature Tm can be used for quality control and for identification of polymers.

Does crystallinity increase TG?
-------------------------------

As crystallinity is introduced the position of Tg is shifted upwards, and also due to the progressive increase in mobility of the constrained amorphous regions with an increase in temperature the breadth of the transition is considerably increased \[31, 32, 33\].

Which has higher Tg?
--------------------

Below Tg, there exists disordered amorphous solid where chain motion is frozen and molecules start wiggling around above Tg. The more immobile the chain, the higher the value of Tg.

What happens at TG?
-------------------

There is a certain temperature(different for each polymer) called the glass transition temperature, or Tg for short. When the polymer is cooled below this temperature, it becomes hard and brittle, like glass. Some polymers are used above their glass transition temperatures, and some are used below.

Is Polyethylene dangerous?
--------------------------

Is PE Toxic? In solid form, no. Polyethylene is often used in food handling. It could be toxic if inhaled and/or absorbed into the skin or eyes as a vapor or liquid (i.e., during manufacturing processes).

What causes a polymer chain to raise TG?
----------------------------------------

In particular, anything that restricts rotational motion within the chain should raise T g. A polymer chain that can move easily will change from a glass to a rubber at a low temperature.

How to calculate the transition temperature of polyethylene?
------------------------------------------------------------

Polyethylene(PE), Tg = -120 ºC Polycarbonate(PC), Tg ≈ 150 ºC Poly(α-methyl styrene) Polystyrene(PS) Poly(methacrylate)(PMMA) Tg ≈ 168 ºC Tg = 100 ºC Tg ≈ 105 ºC – Strong intermolecular attractive forces pull the chain together and hinder relative motions of segments of different macromolecules.

Why does PVC have a higher T G than polypropylene?
--------------------------------------------------

Stiffening groups in the polymer chain reduce the flexibility of the chain and raise the value of T g . Stronger intermolecular forces lead to a higher T g. PVC has stronger intermolecular forces than polypropylene because of the dipole-dipole forces from the C-Cl bond.

Which is polar polymers have a high Tg?
---------------------------------------

Also polar polymers and those have a in which hydrogen bonding are important therefore have a high Tg. Ex&gt; Polyacrylonitrile Poly(vinyl alcohol) Polypropylene PAN, Tg ≈ 97 ºC PVA, Tg = 85 ºC PVAc, Tg ≈ 32 ºC (PP), Tg ≈-15ºC
