What stores materials in cells?
-------------------------------

Chapter 7: Cell Structure and Function

<table><tr><th>A</th><th>B</th></tr><tr><td>vacuole</td><td>a cell organelle that stores materials such as water, salts, proteins, and carbohydrates</td></tr><tr><td>chloroplast</td><td>an organelle found in the cells of plants and some other organisms that uses energy from sunlight to make energy-rich food molecules by photosynthesis</td></tr></table>

What packages items in a cell?
------------------------------

Pieces of the Golgi membrane pinch off to form vesicles that transport molecules around the cell. The Golgi apparatus can be thought of as similar to a post office; it packages and labels “items” and then sends them to different parts of the cell. Both plant and animal cells have a Golgi apparatus.

What organelle packages materials for cells?
--------------------------------------------

The Golgi apparatus is a set of flattened, membrane-bound sacs that serve as the packaging and distribution center of the cell.

What are the main differences between plant and animal cells?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Major structural differences between a plant and an animal cell include: Plant cells have a cell wall, but animals cells do not. Cell walls provide support and give shape to plants. Plant cells have chloroplasts, but animal cells do not.

What packages proteins in a cell?
---------------------------------

Figure 1: The Golgi apparatus modifies and sorts proteins for transport throughout the cell. The Golgi apparatus is often found in close proximity to the ER in cells.

What are the 5 differences between plant and animal cells Class 8?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Plant cells are larger than animal cells. Plant cells have plastids whereas animal cells do not have plastids. Centrosomes are absent in plant cell whereas animal cell have centrosomes. Plant cells are without cilia whereas animal cells are with cilia.

Which is part of the cell stores material?
------------------------------------------

Along with the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, these parts are known as the organelles of the cell, which is held together by the cell membrane. Within the cytoplasm of fungal and plant – and some animal, bacterial, and protist cells – are organelles called vacuoles that store materials like… See full answer below.

Which is structure packages materials into vesicles?
----------------------------------------------------

Which structure packages materials into vesicles? A B organelles that contain digestive enzyme lysosomes organelles that make proteins ribosomes organelle in plant cells that stores wat central vacuole oganelle that packages and distributes p golgi apparatus

Where are materials stored in the cell chloroplasts?
----------------------------------------------------

stores materials within the cell chloroplasts closely stacked, flattened sacs (plants only) ribosomes The sites of protein synthesis vesicles transports materials within the cell cytoplasm the region inside the cell except for the nucleus nucleus Organelle that manages or controls the cell functions in a eukaryotic cell chloroplasts

Which is part of the cell provides temporary storage of food?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Provides temporary storage of food, enzymes and waste products cell wall firm, protectice structure that gives the cell its shape in plants, fungi, most bacteria and some protists mitochondria produces a useable form of energy for the cell golgi apparatus packages proteins for transport out of the cell cell structure
