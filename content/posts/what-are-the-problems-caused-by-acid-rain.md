What are the problems caused by acid rain?
------------------------------------------

Respiratory diseases like asthma or chronic bronchitis make it hard for people to breathe. The pollution that causes acid rain can also create tiny particles. When these particles get into people’s lungs, they can cause health problems, or can make existing health problems worse.

What causes acid rain and what problems result from it?
-------------------------------------------------------

Acid rain is caused by a chemical reaction that begins when compounds like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are released into the air. These substances can rise very high into the atmosphere, where they mix and react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form more acidic pollutants, known as acid rain.

What are the harmful effects of acid rain and acid rain?
--------------------------------------------------------

and (4) may cause harmful effects on soil, forests, streams, and lakes. Acid rain results when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) are emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and air currents. The SO2 and NOX react with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids.

What are the benefits of acid rain?
-----------------------------------

In fact, the greatest benefits are the 20,000 to 50,000 lives saved per year because of cleaner air and lower pollution levels. SO2 and NOx emissions can lead to the formation of fine particle pollution and smog, also called ground level ozone.

Which of the following are natural causes of acid rain?
-------------------------------------------------------

Volcanic eruptions release water vapor and gases such as carbon dioxide and monoxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen fluoride, ammonia, methane and silicon tetrafluoride. These gases react with water vapor to precipitate as acid rain.

What is the nature of acid rain?
--------------------------------

Explanation: The nature of acid rain is corrosive. This corrosive nature of acid rain produces many forms of environmental damages. It affects rivers, vegetation, soil and organisms. Acid rain is known to cause widespread environmental damage.

What are three natural causes of acid rain?
-------------------------------------------

How does acid rain affect the health of people?
-----------------------------------------------

Acid Rain Can Cause Health Problems in People. Air pollution like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can cause respiratory diseases, or can make these diseases worse. Respiratory diseases like asthma or chronic bronchitis make it hard for people to breathe.

How does acid rain affect plants and trees?
-------------------------------------------

Effects of Acid Rain on Plants and Trees. Dead or dying trees are a common sight in areas effected by acid rain. Acid rain leaches aluminum from the soil. That aluminum may be harmful to plants as well as animals.

What are the pollutants that cause acid rain?
---------------------------------------------

The vehicles that we use generate pollutants like nitrogen oxide, etc. the silencer of our bikes and cars emits carbon pollutants that get mixed up with air and when rain comes, these get mixed up with it making the rain acidic.

How does acid rain affect lakes and rivers?
-------------------------------------------

Lakes that do not normally have a high level of acidity may temporarily experience effects of acid rain when the melting snow or downpour brings greater amounts of acidic deposition and the soil can’t buffer it.
