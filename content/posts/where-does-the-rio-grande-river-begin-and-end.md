Where does the Rio Grande river begin and end?
----------------------------------------------

The Rio Grande flows out of the snowcapped Rocky Mountains in Colorado from its headwaters in the San Juan Mountains, and journeys 1,900 miles to the Gulf of Mexico. It passes through 800-foot chasms of the Rio Grande Gorge, a wild and remote area of northern New Mexico.

Where does the Rio Grande river get its water?
----------------------------------------------

Although snowmelt from the San Juan Mountains of Colorado (Fig. 7) is a major source of water for the Rio Grande, runoff from northern Mexico also contributes to its flow. As in all arid to semiarid regions, the waters of the Rio Grande River are highly sought after and overallocated.

What Mountain does the Rio Grande start?
----------------------------------------

San Juan mountains  
The Rio Grande begins in the San Juan mountains of Colorado’s southern Rockies and curls its way down to New Mexico, where it tumbles south some 400 miles before hanging a left in El Paso to begin its stretch as the Texan southern border of the United States.

When was the first exploration of the Rio Grande?
-------------------------------------------------

Study and exploration. Probably the first Europeans to see any part of the Rio Grande were those of an expedition sent out in 1519 to survey the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The maps that illustrated this voyage, however, show only nameless indentations for the mouths of rivers on an otherwise smooth coastline.

When did the Rio Grande join the San Juan Mountains?
----------------------------------------------------

The upper reach of this river corresponded to the modern Rio Chama, but by 5 million years ago, an ancestral Rio Grande draining the eastern San Juan Mountains had joined the ancestral Rio Chama.

Are there any dams on the Rio Grande River?
-------------------------------------------

In all, there are 15 dams on the Rio Grande River, many of them in New Mexico. Flows are significant until Elephant Butte Reservoir in New Mexico. El Paso, TX is 125 river miles downstream of Elephant Butte Reservoir and just upstream of the American Dam.
