Why is photodiode preferably used in reverse bias condition?
------------------------------------------------------------

A photodiode is used preferably in in reverse bias condition because the change in reverse current through the photodiode due to change in light flux can be measured easily as the reverse saturation current is directly proportional to the light flux.

Does a photodiode work in a reverse bias?
-----------------------------------------

Photodiodes can be operated without any voltage bias. APDs are designed to be reversed biased, so this section will be relevant to the P-N and PIN photodiodes. Without added voltage across the junction, dark current can be extremely low (near zero). This reduces the overall noise current of the system.

Why LED does not work in reverse bias?
--------------------------------------

Recombination of charge carriers takes place only under forward bias condition. Hence, LEDs operate only in forward bias condition. When light emitting diode is reverse biased, the free electrons (majority carriers) from n-side and holes (majority carriers) from p-side moves away from the junction.

Why there is current in reverse bias condition?
-----------------------------------------------

This condition where the large current cannot flow through diode is due to reverse biasing, due to which the width of depletion region increases and very small current flows due to minority carriers.

Why solar cell is reverse biased?
---------------------------------

The photocurrent is actually a reverse bias current because electrons flow toward the cathode and the holes flow to the anode. If you start applying a voltage, a forward bias, it will start compensating for that reverse photocurrent and eventually, you will reach point where the current goes to zero.

Which one of the following optoelectronic devices works under reverse bias conditions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Photodiode  
Photodiode is a device based on the principle of photovoltaic effect. When photons of energy greater than the band-gap falls on photodiode (p-n junction diode), it excites electron from the valence band to conduction band. It is used in reverse-bias.

What photodiode is used in reverse bias?
----------------------------------------

(A). Photocurrent flows only in reverse bias.

What is reverse bias?
---------------------

In a standard diode, forward biasing occurs when the voltage across a diode permits the natural flow of current, whereas reverse biasing denotes a voltage across the diode in the opposite direction.

Can we use LED in reverse bias?
-------------------------------

An LED is a light emitting diode. The LED emits light when it is forward biased and it emits no light when it is reverse biased.

How much current is reverse bias?
---------------------------------

Thus, when reverse biased, the diode behaves much like an open switch; and when forward biased, for currents of about 10 mA or greater, the diode gives a nearly constant voltage drop of ~0.7 V .

Does current flow in reverse bias justify?
------------------------------------------

The resistance of a reverse biased semiconductor is not infinite so yes, there is current flow but is very low. Zener diodes are almost always used in reverse bias as voltage references. There may be a small current less than 1uA (negligible), schottky diodes have slightly more reverse leakage.

Is Zener diode reverse biased?
------------------------------

A Zener diode is a silicon semiconductor device that permits current to flow in either a forward or reverse direction. The Zener diode has a well-defined reverse-breakdown voltage, at which it starts conducting current, and continues operating continuously in the reverse-bias mode without getting damaged.

Why is a photodiode is used in reverse bias?
--------------------------------------------

When a photo- diode is reverse biased, the width of depletion layer increases as compared to forward biased and a small reverse current (dark current) flows through the diode.

Which is more significant in reverse bias current or photocurrent?
------------------------------------------------------------------

We can say that in reverse bias, diode changes the incident light to current, more significantly due to broad depletion layer i.e. photocurrent is significant in reverse bias as compared to the forward bias current. Was this answer helpful?

How does the reverse biased pn junction work?
---------------------------------------------

Another way to think of the reverse biased PN junction is as a high field region (due to the dopant ions left by the reverse bias of the junction). The moment you create a hole-electron pair from a photon, each of these carriers are rapidly separated and swept out of the depletion region to create a photocurrent.

Why is forward bias less responsive than reverse bias?
------------------------------------------------------

Forward bias tends to be less responsive, in terms of speed, (due to capacitance) compared to reverse bias. This is because when you apply a reverse voltage, the charge carriers (holes and electrons) move thus depletion region increases and this reduces capacitance.
