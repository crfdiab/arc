Why did the colonists leave?
----------------------------

The Pilgrims were forced to leave England because they refused to follow the Church of England. In 1620, the Pilgrims were given permission to settle in Virginia. They sailed on a tiny ship, the Mayflower, on September 16, 1620. A storm blew the Mayflower north.

What are some reasons that colonists are moving towards revolution?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The American Revolution was principally caused by colonial opposition to British attempts to impose greater control over the colonies and to make them repay the crown for its defense of them during the French and Indian War (1754â€“63).

Why did the people come to the colonies?
----------------------------------------

These young men and women were unmarried and sought to work off their debts and begin their new life in the colonies, where capitalism had made the ventures of growing sugar, tobacco and cotton promisingly profitable ventures. Some colonists that came to the American colonies were not sent by their own will, though.

When did the colonies move toward open rebellion?
-------------------------------------------------

The Colonies Move Toward Open Rebellion, 1773-1774 After the Boston Massacre and the repeal of most of the Townshend Duties (the duty on tea remained in force), a period of relative quiet descended on the British North American colonies. Even so, the crises of the past decade had created incompatible mindsets on opposite sides of the Atlantic.

Why do people move from the country to a big city?
--------------------------------------------------

There are a few reasons, actually very good ones for that matter, why people move from a farmhouse to a high rise. This guide explains the differences between rural and urban regions and some of the reasons why people relocate from the country to city. Simplicity is the best word to describe the country life.

Why was the capital of the United States moved?
-----------------------------------------------

By 1787 the United States had already drafted their constitution. The constitution gave the Congress the authority to choose where to build the federal district; therefore they proposed two cities (Germantown and Lancaster). However, Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison had agreed to move it to the south (present-day Washington).
