Where does the river flow through?
----------------------------------

The other end of a river is called its mouth, where water empties into a larger body of water, such as a lake or ocean. Along the way, rivers may pass through wetlands where plants slow down the water and filter out pollutants.

What is the name of what a river flows in?

Do rivers flow east or west?

Where does the river flow under your feet?
------------------------------------------

If you are standing on the bank of a river, the river may well be flowing under your feet. This area underground where the river flows is called the hyporheic zone(hy-po-ree-ik). In the hyporheic zone, many forms of life can be found.

Are there any rivers that drain into the Atlantic Ocean?
--------------------------------------------------------

Most rivers of the central U.S. flow into the Gulf of Mexicovia the Mississippi River. Indirectly, this is an Atlantic Ocean drainage.

Rivers around the Great Lakesand along the entire east coast of Canada and the U.S. flow directly into the Atlantic Ocean.
