What is a salt bed in nature?
-----------------------------

Salt domes are thick formations created from natural salt deposits that, over time, leach up through overlying sedimentary layers to form large dome-type structures. Salt beds are shallower, thinner formations. These formations are usually no more than 1000 ft in height.

The salt extraction process is an electrolytic method which may be used to extract valuable metals from slag, low-grade ores, or other materials by using molten salts.

Why is salt mining dangerous?
-----------------------------

Before the advent of the modern internal combustion engine and earth-moving equipment, mining salt was one of the most expensive and dangerous of operations because of rapid dehydration caused by constant contact with the salt (both in the mine passages and scattered in the air as salt dust) and of other problems …

7  
Here NaCl is a Neutral base,and hence the PH is equal to 7.

How is salt extracted from an underground bed?
----------------------------------------------

Salt is extracted from underground beds either by mining or by solution mining using water to dissolve the salt. In solution mining the salt reaches the surface as brine, from which the water is evaporated leaving salt crystals.

What’s the best way to make table salt?
---------------------------------------

The salty brine may be treated prior to evaporation to reduce mineral content, yielding a nearly pure sodium chloride crystal. This method is inexpensive, has a high yield, and produces a very clean salt. Most table salt is produced with this method.
