What is the deep ocean floor called?
------------------------------------

abyssal plain  
The ocean floor is called the abyssal plain. Below the ocean floor, there are a few small deeper areas called ocean trenches. Features rising up from the ocean floor include seamounts, volcanic islands and the mid-oceanic ridges and rises.

What are the oceans depth layers called?
----------------------------------------

The deep ocean is further divided into 3 layers which are the midnight zone, the abyss and the trenches.

What is called abyssal plain?
-----------------------------

Abyssal plain, flat seafloor area at an abyssal depth (3,000 to 6,000 m \[10,000 to 20,000 feet\]), generally adjacent to a continent. These submarine surfaces vary in depth only from 10 to 100 cm per kilometre of horizontal distance.

What lives on the ocean floor?
------------------------------

These include animals such as sea cucumbers, sea stars, crustaceans and some worms. Other animals need to have something solid to attach themselves to the seafloor, such as sponges, hard and soft corals and some anemones.

Which is the deepest part of the ocean floor?
---------------------------------------------

Abyssal Plains are underwater plains on the deep ocean floor. They are usually 4500 and 6000 meters deep. They are some of the flattest places on Earth. Trenches are long and narrow canyon like features, parallel to continental margins. They are the deepest parts of the ocean floor.

Is the sea floor the same as the seafloor?
------------------------------------------

Map showing the underwater topography ( bathymetry) of the ocean floor. Like land terrain, the ocean floor has mountains including volcanoes, ridges, valleys and plains. The seabed (also known as the seafloor, sea floor, or ocean floor) is the bottom of the ocean, no matter how deep. All floors of the ocean are known as ‘seabeds’.

What is the bottom of the ocean called?
---------------------------------------

The seabed (also known as the seafloor, sea floor, or ocean floor) is the bottom of the ocean.

What are the different parts of the ocean floor?
------------------------------------------------

The ocean floor is divided into several different areas. The first is the continental shelf, the nearly flat, underwater extension of a continent. Continental shelves vary in width. They are usually wide along low-lying land, and narrow along mountainous coasts.
