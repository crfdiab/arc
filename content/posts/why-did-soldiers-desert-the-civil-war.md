------------------------------------------------------------

Does the US Army still shoot deserters?
---------------------------------------

UCMJ Desertion A charge of desertion can actually result in the death penalty, which is the maximum punishment during “time of war.” However, since the Civil War, only one American servicemember has ever been executed for desertion: Private Eddie Slovik in 1945.

Did deserters get branded?
--------------------------

Deserters were branded, usually on the forehead, cheek, hand, or hip, with the first letter of their crime. ‘D’ for deserter, ‘C’ for cowardice, ‘T’ for thief, or ‘W’ for worthlessness. Not all branding was done with hot irons; indelible ink was often used instead.

How many Confederate soldiers were there?
-----------------------------------------

750,000  
The total number of Confederate soldiers is estimated at 750,000, as opposed to twice that many Federal troops. (Confederate population stood at about 5,500,000 whites and 3,500,000 Black slaves, as against 22,000,000 Northerners.)

Who are the deserters in the US Army?
-------------------------------------

If Slovik was the unluckiest deserter in the U.S. Army, Wayne Powers was probably the most fortunate.

In November 1944, he met a dark-haired French girl named Yvette Beleuse in Mont-d’Origny, a village near the Belgian border.

How many Israelites were in the army of Joshua?
-----------------------------------------------

Joshua 4:13 tells us this: About 40,000 ready for war passed over before the Lord for battle, to the plains of Jericho (ESV). From this verse alone, you might think that there were a total of 40,000 soldiers in the army of Israel, set to conquer the land.

Why did most deserters go on the run?
-------------------------------------

While 80 percent of deserters were frontline infantrymen escaping after long periods of continuous combat, Slovik never fought in battle. Nor did he go on the run as most deserters did. His mistake was to make clear that he preferred prison to battle.
