Why is soil important to the ecosystem?
---------------------------------------

Soil provides ecosystem services critical for life: soil acts as a water filter and a growing medium; provides habitat for billions of organisms, contributing to biodiversity; and supplies most of the antibiotics used to fight diseases.

Why is soil the most essential resource?
----------------------------------------

Composed of minerals, water, air and organic matter, soil provides primary nutrient cycling for plant and animal life and acts as a basis for feed, fuel, fibre and medical products as well as for many critical ecosystem services. “Soil degradation is a silent process but with huge consequences for humanity.

What are the 6 roles of soil?
-----------------------------

These soil functions include: air quality and composition, temperature regulation, carbon and nutrient cycling, water cycling and quality, natural “waste” (decomposition) treatment and recycling, and habitat for most living things and their food. We could not survive without these soil functions.

What are the four advantages of ploughing?
------------------------------------------

The advantages of ploughing are:Loosening of soil can improve air circulation. The roots can penetrate deeper into the soil, thus holding the plant firmly. Ploughing enhances the water retention capacity of the soil. Ploughing uproots the weeds growing in the field and aids in the growth of microbes.

Why is soil so important to the ecosystem?
------------------------------------------

Ecosystems Services. Advances in watershed,natural resource,and environmental sciences have shown that soil is the foundation of basic ecosystem function.Soil filters our water,provides essential nutrients to our forests and crops,and helps regulate the Earth’s temperature as well as many of the important greenhouse gases.

Which is responsible for the unbalance of soil structure?
---------------------------------------------------------

Activities such as mining, agriculture, forestry, and waste disposal are often responsible for the unbalance of soil structure and functions, by jeopardizing majorly the functional biodiversity compartment of the ecosystem. Therefore, the provision of goods along with ecosystem services will be also affected.

How are stressors related to the soil ecosystem?
------------------------------------------------

Soil ecosystems are nowadays exposed to several physical, chemical, and biological stressors, which are directly or indirectly related to anthropogenic activities. This chapter covers how contaminants affect the soil ecosystem structure, changing soil functions and services.

How does contaminants affect the structure of the soil ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter covers how contaminants affect the soil ecosystem structure, changing soil functions and services. Soil ecosystem structure is constituted by dynamic interactive abiotic and biotic compartments, dependent on major key factors like water and light.
