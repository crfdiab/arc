Which plate boundary is the deepest?
------------------------------------

The Mariana trench contains the deepest part of the world’s oceans, and runs along an oceanic-oceanic convergent boundary. It is the result of the oceanic Pacific plate subducting beneath the oceanic Mariana plate.

Is the Mariana Trench divergent or convergent?
----------------------------------------------

The trench lies along the convergent boundary where the Pacific plate, on the east, subducts beneath the relatively tiny Mariana plate, on the west.

Which plate is the largest plate on Earth?
------------------------------------------

the Pacific Plate  
There are major, minor and micro tectonic plates. There are seven major plates: African, Antarctic, Eurasian, Indo-Australian, North American, Pacific and South American. The Hawaiian Islands were created by the Pacific Plate, which is the world’s largest plate at 39,768,522 square miles.

Is Mariana Trench convergent boundary?
--------------------------------------

What kind of plate boundary is associated with deep ocean trenches?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

What type of plate boundary is associated with deep ocean trenches? In particular, ocean trenches are a feature of convergent plate boundaries , where two or more tectonic plates meet. At many convergent plate boundaries , dense lithosphere melts or slides beneath less-dense lithosphere in a process called subduction, creating a trench .

What is the definition of an oceanic trench?
--------------------------------------------

› Oceanic trench is a deep section of the ocean usually where an oceanic plate is sinking below a continental plate. › Continents can tuck under each other just like one piece of paper can tuck under another, in a process called subduction. › Ocean trenches are natural tectonic plate boundaries between two crustal plates.

How is the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean formed?
------------------------------------------------------

More rarely, ocean trenches can be formed when two plates carrying oceanic crust meet. The Mariana Trench, in the South Pacific Ocean, is formed as the mighty Pacific plate subducts beneath the smaller, less-dense Philippine plate.

Is the Mariana Trench a divergent or convergent boundary?
---------------------------------------------------------

As seen in Figure 1, the Mariana Trench is associated with two different types of plate boundaries: a divergent plate boundary and a convergent plate boundary. The Mariana Ridge is located just northeast of Challenger Deep and is associated with the divergent plate boundary.
