What signs will tell you that a lightning is close enough to harm you?

How can you tell if a thunderstorm is on top of You?
----------------------------------------------------

If you see a thunderstorm in the distance, see a flash of lightning, and count 15 seconds before you hear the thunder, then the thunderstorm you see is three miles away (15 seconds / 5 = 3 miles). If the lightning and thunder seem to strike at the same time, then the thunderstorm is right on top of you (0 seconds / 5 = 0 miles).

How to tell how far away a storm is with lightning?
---------------------------------------------------

After you see a flash of lightning, count the number of seconds until you hear the thunder. (Use the stop watch or count “One-Mississippi, Two-Mississippi, Three-Mississippi,” etc.) For every 5 seconds the storm is one mile away. Divide the number of seconds you count by 5 to get the number of miles.

How to calculate the distance from a thunderstorm?
--------------------------------------------------

For example, if you counted to 15 seconds before you heard thunder, divide 15 by 5 to get 3 miles. To calculate the distance in kilometers, divide the seconds by 3 instead. So, 15 divided by 3 would be 5 kilometers in distance.
