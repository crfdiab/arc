What is a composite volcano and how is it formed?
-------------------------------------------------

Composite cone volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes. They form when different types of eruptions deposit different materials around the sides of a volcano. Alternating eruptions of volcanic ash and lava cause layers to form. Over time these layers build up. Helens is an example of a composite cone volcano.

What is a composite volcano short answer?
-----------------------------------------

Composite volcanoes are tall, steep cones that produce explosive eruptions. Shield volcanoes form very large, gently sloped mounds from effusive eruptions. Cinder cones are the smallest volcanoes and result from accumulation of many small fragments of ejected material.

What is called composite volcano?
---------------------------------

composite volcano. A volcano with a broad base, steep sides, and often a crater at the top. The volcano is composed of alternating layers of ash and lava flows. Also called a stratovolcano.

Where are composite volcanoes found?
------------------------------------

Composite volcanoes are found on destructive plate margins , where the oceanic crust sinks beneath the continental crust. Composite volcanoes have the following characteristics: Acidic lava, which is very viscous (sticky). Steep sides as the lava doesn’t flow very far before it solidifies.

What kind of volcano is a composite volcano?
--------------------------------------------

Composite volcanoes are steep sided volcanoes that reach great heights on the continents. The volcanoes expel a variety of stiff pasty lavas that form thick lava flows. Another name for a composite volcano is stratovolcano. These lava flows alternate with explosive eruptions of tephra.

How long does it take for a composite volcano to form?
------------------------------------------------------

Formation of Composite Volcano A composite volcano is built over a span of thousands of years through multiple eruptions. The eruptions build the composite volcano layer by layer until the volcano towers thousands of metres. Some layers are of lava, while others might be of ash, rock, etc.

How tall is the summit of a composite volcano?
----------------------------------------------

Structure of a Composite Volcano A composite volcano may rise as high as 8,000 feet above their bases. Most of the composite volcanoes have a crater at the summit which contains a central vent or a clustered group of vents.

What are the consequences of a composite volcano?
-------------------------------------------------

Death and property damage aren’t the only consequences of composite volcanoes. Because they eject matter and gases into the stratosphere, they affect weather and climate. Particulates released by composite volcanoes yield colorful sunrises and sunsets.
