What is the difference between volcanic mountains and plateaus mountain?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mountains are formed because of the movements in the tectonic plate. Due to this geographical activity, several variations are formed in the mountains like folding, volcanic activities, etc. Plateaus are formed due to an upsurge in volcanic activities, erosion in waters, glaciers, etc. Mountains are cone-shaped.

What is the difference between fault block and upward mountains?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Fault-block mountains are formed when two tectonic plates collide, pushing one over the other while upwarped mountains form when a hot spot of magma pushes upward through the earth’s crust.

How are fault block mountains?
------------------------------

Fault-block mountains are formed by the movement of large crustal blocks along faults formed when tensional forces pull apart the crust (Figure 3). Tension is often the result of uplifting part of the crust; it can also be produced by opposite-flowing convection cells in the mantle (see Figure 1).

How are fault block mountains formed and how are they formed?
-------------------------------------------------------------

\[/caption\] Fault-block mountains are formed by the movement of large crustal blocks when forces in the Earth’s crust pull it apart. Some parts of the Earth are pushed upward and others collapse down. To understand a fault-block mountain, or sometimes referred as a “fault mountain”, you need to understand what a fault is.

How are block mountains different from middle mountains?
--------------------------------------------------------

Block mountains may originate when the middle block moves downward and becomes a rift valley while the surrounding blocks stand higher as block mountains. Sometimes, the surrounding blocks subside leaving the middle block stationary. Such cases are found in high plateau regions.

How is a plateau different from a mountain?
-------------------------------------------

So, these are the major differences between a mountain and a plateau. The most common and basic point of contrast between a mountain and a plateau is its shape. For instance, mountains have a cone-like shape, while a plateau has a table-like shape. Some of the well-known mountains are:

How are block mountains and rift valleys related?
-------------------------------------------------

Block mountains may originate when the middle block moves downward and becomes a rift valley while the surrounding blocks stand higher as block mountains. Sometimes, the surrounding blocks subside leaving the middle block stationary.
