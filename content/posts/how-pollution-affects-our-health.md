How pollution affects our health?
---------------------------------

The health effects of air pollution are serious – one third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease are due to air pollution. Microscopic pollutants in the air can slip past our body’s defences, penetrating deep into our respiratory and circulatory system, damaging our lungs, heart and brain.

How can air pollutants affect human health?
-------------------------------------------

Air pollution can also cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Long-term health effects from air pollution include heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Air pollution can also cause long-term damage to people’s nerves, brain, kidneys, liver, and other organs.

How does water pollution endanger human health?
-----------------------------------------------

One of the greatest dangers to human health is water pollution. After all, people can’t survive without drinking water, and if their freshwater resources are polluted, they can become ill from drinking them. Different types of pollutants affect human health in different ways. Organisms that cause disease are called pathogens.

What are the health effects of air pollution?
---------------------------------------------

The health effects of air pollution are serious – one third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease are due to air pollution. This is having an equivalent effect to that of smoking tobacco, and much higher than, say, the effects of eating too much salt.

What are the health dangers of cigarette smoke?
-----------------------------------------------

The biggest health threat from smoke is from fine particles. These microscopic particles can penetrate deep into your lungs. They can cause a range of health problems, from burning eyes and a runny nose to aggravated chronic heart and lung diseases. Exposure to particle pollution is even linked to premature death.

Are there limitations to the air pollution study?
-------------------------------------------------

However, the study has limitations, including that it looked only at one component of air pollution and only considered outdoor air pollution near patients’ homes.
