What if gravity was slightly weaker?
------------------------------------

Under weaker gravity, every rock in the earth suddenly weighs 5% less. That means that the planet’s interior no longer has enough pressure to hold it in place, causing it to expand outwards. The crust, only a few tens of kilometers thick at best, is unable to bear the immense force. It shatters like a glass window.

What would happen if gravity was stronger or weaker?
----------------------------------------------------

If Earth’s gravity was just 5% stronger, the increase would warp our planet’s near-perfect circlular orbit into a tighter elliptical path. The Earth’s core would probably just collapse on itself, causing everyone to fall to their deaths, or releasing enough heat to cook us all alive!

What would happen if we lived in a world without gravity?
---------------------------------------------------------

The most important things held to the Earth by gravity are the atmosphere and our water. Without gravity, the air in the atmosphere isn’t compelled to stick around, so it would immediately begin drifting off into space. Earth’s oceans, lakes, and rivers would also depart.

What would happen if gravity increased by 10%?
----------------------------------------------

If earth’s gravity is increased 10 times in an instant, the size of the sphere would contract into a new equilibrium with higher density, which means higher pressure and temperature. The now thinner crust of Earth would be heated up beyond melting point and all life on earth would end.

Can a human survive 10x gravity?
--------------------------------

Human Limits Based on an average mammal bone, they estimated that a human skeleton could support a gravitational force more than 90 times Earth gravity. This means we could run on a planet with a gravitational field around ten times that of Earth’s before our bones started to crack.

What happens if gravity wasn’t so weak?
---------------------------------------

Gravitation is feebler than the forces governing the microworld by the number N, about 10 36. What would happen if it weren’t quite so weak? Imagine, for instance, a universe where gravity was ‘only’ 10 30 rather than 10 36 feebler than electric forces.

What happens if the Earth’s gravity was stronger?
-------------------------------------------------

But up the gravity on Earth by just a little bit, and you ruin everything. If Earth’s gravity was just 5% stronger, the increase would warp our planet’s near-perfect circlular orbit into a tighter elliptical path.

Can a person fly away from the Earth because of gravity?
--------------------------------------------------------

They would not fly off because they are being held down. In fact, the force you would need to hold on and keep yourself from flying away from the Earth is very weak, only about 0.3% as strong as the force of gravity (and even weaker away from the equator).

How does the gravity of the sun affect the Earth?
-------------------------------------------------

Since the Sun is 330,000 times heavier than Earth, its gravitational influence pulls the Earth towards it. Luckily, our planet moves sideways from the Sun’s pull, and fast enough, so that it doesn’t get sucked into that giant ball of hot plasma.
