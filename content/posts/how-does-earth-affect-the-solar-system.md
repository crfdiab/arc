How does Earth affect the solar system?
---------------------------------------

The Earth acting together with the Sun has them in control. There are also Trojan-type asteroids that orbit around the Lagrange points of the planet-Sun system, points selected by the combined gravity if the planet and Sun.

What is the Earth importance?
