What are three characteristics of biotic factors?
-------------------------------------------------

The importance of biotic factors lies in their presence or the presence of their materials that affect the different components of an ecosystem. These materials include organisms, interactions, parts, wastes and also their presence. Factors such as disease, predation and parasitism can also be considered biotic.

What are the 2 types of factors that can be found in an ecosystem?
------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two categories of these factors: abiotic and biotic. Abiotic factors are the non-living parts of the environment that can often have a major influence on living organisms. Abiotic factors include water, sunlight, oxygen, soil and temperature.

How are biotic factors and abiotic elements related?
----------------------------------------------------

The Biotic factors Are the interactions that these individuals have in a given ecosystem. In turn, the biotic elements interact with nature, drink water, walk the earth and breathe air. Elements such as water, earth and air are abiotic elements or factors. They are very necessary, fundamental for life to be sustainable.

Which is an example of a biotic factor?
---------------------------------------

A biotic factor is a living organism that shapes its environment. In a freshwater ecosystem, examples might include aquatic plants, fish, amphibians, and algae.

How are biotic factors organized in a community?
------------------------------------------------

Biological factors are usually organized in populations, namely, groups of individuals of the same species that share a specific habitat. In turn, populations of the same area interact with each other, forming a community.

How do biotic resources affect the composition of an ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Their presence and their biological by-products affect the composition of an ecosystem. Biotic resources include all living organisms from animals and humans, to plants, fungi, and bacteria. The interactions between various biotic factors are necessary for the survival and reproduction of each species.
