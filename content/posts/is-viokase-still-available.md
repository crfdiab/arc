Is Viokase still available?
---------------------------

The Viokase brand name has been discontinued in the U.S. If generic versions of this product have been approved by the FDA, there may be generic equivalents available.

Is there a generic for Viokase?
-------------------------------

Viokase is available in generic form.

When do you give Viokase?
-------------------------

VIOKASE-V tablets are administered before each meal. VIOKASE-V powder is added to moistened dog food (canned or dry). Thorough mixing is necessary to bring the enzymes into close contact with the food particles. Incubation at room temperature for 15–20 minutes before feeding appears to enhance the digestive process.

Can Viokase be crushed?
-----------------------

Tablets should be swallowed whole and NOT crushed or chewed. In order to avoid mucosal irritation, care should be taken to ensure that no drug is retained in the mouth.

What is Viokase used for in dogs?
---------------------------------

Viokase-V relieves the symptoms of Pancreatic Insufficiency Disorder (PID) in dogs and cats. PID is also known as EPI, or Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency. This prescription medication replaces the pancreatic enzymes that your dog or cat doesn’t produce but needs to digest the protein, sugar, and fat in food.

What is EPI dog?
----------------

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is the inability to produce sufficient pancreatic enzymes to digest fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. This difficulty in digestion leads to poor absorption of nutrients which commonly causes weight loss despite a normal or increased appetite.

How does Viokase work?
----------------------

This medication contains digestive enzymes, which are natural substances needed by the body to help break down and digest food. It is used when the pancreas cannot make or does not release enough digestive enzymes into the gut to digest the food.

What drug class is Glucotrol?
-----------------------------

Glipizide belongs to the class of drugs known as sulfonylureas. It lowers blood sugar by causing the release of your body’s natural insulin.

Which pancreatic enzymes are crushed?
-------------------------------------

For jejunally placed tubes, enzyme microspheres can be crushed and activated with sodium bicarbonate before flushing into the tube, or the activated enzyme mixture can be added to enteral feeds.

What happens when a dog gets pancreatitis?
------------------------------------------

Dogs with severe pancreatitis are likely to suffer from symptoms including a loss of appetite, sickness, diarrhoea and lethargy. They may also show signs of abdominal pain and dehydration. In milder forms, symptoms aren’t quite as obvious but may still include loss of appetite, lethargy, and diarrhoea.

Does EPI shorten a dog’s life?
------------------------------

Conclusions and clinical importance: Long-term prognosis in canine EPI is favorable for dogs that survive the initial treatment period. Although there are few predictors of good RIT or long-term survival, severe cobalamin deficiency is associated with shorter survival.

What does EPI poop look like?
-----------------------------

Foul-smelling, greasy stools (steatorrhea) The undigested fat that passes through the digestive system may cause oily or greasy-looking stools. These stools may also smell really bad, float, and be difficult to flush. Not all people experience steatorrhea, but it is the most common sign of EPI.
