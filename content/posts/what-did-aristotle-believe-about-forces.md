What did Aristotle believe about forces?
----------------------------------------

2.1 Aristotelian Force He thought that heavy bodies fall faster because the falling speed is in proportion to the physis (nature) or weight of the objects. The earth and the sky are natural places objects would move to according to their internal natural tendencies.

What is Aristotle theory of motion?
-----------------------------------

Aristotle’s theory of motion is centered on this idea of a natural resting place. He believed that all motion was centered upon the object trying to reach its natural resting position. (Jones) Aristotle also used the principles of natural motion and violent motion to describe movements.

Did Aristotle believe that moving objects are always being pushed?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on observation Aristotle asserted that object stay in motion only if they are pushed, but left to themselves object come to a state of rest. So the state of “rest” is the natural state of motion to which all things return. If I push a book across a desk I find no reason to object to Aristotle’s view.

What will be the interpretation of Aristotle and Galileo to the situation a ball is rolled across the table and rolls slowly until it stops?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How would you interpret it? Answer: Aristotle would probably say that the ball stops because it seeks its natural state of rest. Galileo would probably say that the friction between the ball and the table overcomes the ball’s natural tendency to continue rolling— overcomes the ball’s inertia—and brings it to a stop.

What are the ideas of Aristotle?
--------------------------------

Aristotle’s philosophy stresses biology, instead of mathematics like Plato. He believed the world was made up of individuals (substances) occurring in fixed natural kinds (species). Each individual has built-in patterns of development, which help it grow toward becoming a fully developed individual of its kind.

What are the contributions of Aristotle?
----------------------------------------

He made pioneering contributions to all fields of philosophy and science, he invented the field of formal logic, and he identified the various scientific disciplines and explored their relationships to each other. Aristotle was also a teacher and founded his own school in Athens, known as the Lyceum.

What is Aristotle’s theory on the relation between force and motion?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary: Basically, Aristotle’s view of motion is “it requires a force to make an object move in an unnatural” manner – or, more simply, “motion requires force” . After all, if you push a book, it moves. When you stop pushing, the book stops moving.

Can a ball roll forever?
------------------------

If a ball undergoes motion and is rolling over a velocity of 15m/s. So due to this friction, velocity of the ball will become zero and the ball will come in its intial rest position. Due to “Kinetic Friction” ball does not roll forever.

Did Aristotle believe in inertia?
---------------------------------

Aristotle did not believe in the void and thought the universe was a continuum. Galileo refined the concept of inertia. The theory of inertia says that an objects inertia will maintain its state of motion. So the ball should roll on forever.

What did Aristotelian say about the speed of motion?
----------------------------------------------------

The speed of such motion depends on their weights and the density of the medium. Aristotle argued that a vacuum could not exist as speeds would become infinite. Aristotle described four causes or explanations of change as seen on earth: the material, formal, efficient, and final causes of things.

What did Aristotle mean by natural and unnatural motion?
--------------------------------------------------------

Natural vs Unnatural Motion For objects on Earth, Aristotle thought that objects moved by people (“unnatural motion”) would move in a straight line, and when that “unnatural force” ran out, then natural motion would take over. So what would happen if a canon fired a cannonball?

What is the Aristotelian explanation of the nature of gravity?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Natural place. The Aristotelian explanation of gravity is that all bodies move toward their natural place. For the elements earth and water, that place is the center of the (geocentric) universe; the natural place of water is a concentric shell around the earth because earth is heavier; it sinks in water.

Why was the Aristotelian theory of Physics discredited?
-------------------------------------------------------

Life and death of Aristotelian physics. In Europe, Aristotle’s theory was first convincingly discredited by Galileo’s studies. Using a telescope, Galileo observed that the Moon was not entirely smooth, but had craters and mountains, contradicting the Aristotelian idea of the incorruptibly perfect smooth Moon.
