How do plants get the energy to make glucose?
---------------------------------------------

Plants, unlike animals, can make their own food. They do this using a process called photosynthesis . During photosynthesis, plants produce glucose from simple inorganic molecules – carbon dioxide and water – using light energy.

Where does the energy to create glucose come from?
--------------------------------------------------

Answer 1: During photosynthesis, a plant is able to convert solar energy into a chemical form. It does this by capturing light coming from the sun and, through a series of reactions, using its energy to help build asugar molecule called glucose.

Do plants need energy to make glucose?
--------------------------------------

Plants convert energy from sunlight into sugar in a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis uses energy from light to convert water and carbon dioxide molecules into glucose (sugar molecule) and oxygen (Figure 2).

Where is energy originally from the Sun stored in a glucose molecule?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This transforms the water into oxygen and the carbon dioxide into glucose. The plant then releases the oxygen back into the air, and stores energy within the glucose molecules. Inside the plant cell are small organelles called chloroplasts, which store the energy of sunlight.

How do I get positive energy in my bedroom?
-------------------------------------------

Spend time in your bedroom. Do your reading, writing and listening to music (and other hobbies) in your bedroom. Actions that give you happiness will increase the positive aura in your bedroom, and make it a calm and happy place. Keep doors and windows open for at least 15-20 minutes daily.

Which plant is good for positive energy?
----------------------------------------

Aloe vera has a great source of positivity and helps to fight bad luck. It has amazing healing properties and removes the polluting chemicals from the environment.

Do plants store glucose?
------------------------

In plants, glucose is stored in the form of starch, which can be broken down back into glucose via cellular respiration in order to supply ATP.

What is the main source of energy for photosynthesis?
-----------------------------------------------------

the Sun  
During the process of photosynthesis, cells use carbon dioxide and energy from the Sun to make sugar molecules and oxygen. These sugar molecules are the basis for more complex molecules made by the photosynthetic cell, such as glucose.

How is glucose broken down energy?
----------------------------------

During cellular respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. Energy released during the reaction is captured by the energy-carrying molecule ATP (adenosine triphosphate).

How do plants use the glucose they have made?
---------------------------------------------

 Cellular respiration is a chemical reaction plants need to get energy from glucose. Respiration uses glucose and oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water and release energy. Plants make their own food by photosynthesis. During photosynthesis a plant takes in water, carbon dioxide and light energy, and gives out glucose and oxygen.

Where does the energy come from in glucose?
-------------------------------------------

Best Answer: All energy originally comes from the sun. The plants make carbohydrates out of sunlight… so they have sunlight for dinner and we get to eat the sugars the plant produces – and those are made into glucose in our blood stream…. Either photosynthesis or thermosynthesis.

How are electrons used in photosynthesis to produce glucose?
------------------------------------------------------------

The electrons it takes are put into an electron transport system, where they are used to produce energy molecules called ATP that are used to build the glucose molecule– all made possible by the sun’s energy. Thus, during photosynthesis a plant consumes water, carbon dioxide, and light energy, and produces glucose and oxygen.

What kind of energy does a plant use in photosynthesis?
-------------------------------------------------------

During photosynthesis a plant takes in water, carbon dioxide and light energy, and gives out glucose and oxygen. It takes light from the sun, carbon and oxygen atoms from the air and hydrogen from water to make energy molecules called ATP, which then build glucose molecules.
