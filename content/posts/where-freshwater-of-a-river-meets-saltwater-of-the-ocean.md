Where freshwater of a river meets saltwater of the ocean?
---------------------------------------------------------

Estuaries  
Estuaries form a unique marine biome that occurs where a source of fresh water, such as a river, meets the ocean. Therefore, both fresh water and salt water are found in the same vicinity.

Which area contains both salt and fresh water?
----------------------------------------------

Estuaries are home to unique plant and animal communities that have adapted to brackish waterâ€”a mixture of fresh water draining from the land and salty seawater. In fresh water the concentration of salts, or salinity, is nearly zero. The salinity of water in the ocean averages about 35 parts per thousand (ppt).

Where does the ocean and fresh water meet?

estuary: coastal water body where ocean tides and river water merge Estuaries: Where the Ocean Meets Fresh Water Estuaries form a unique marine biome that occurs where a source of fresh water, such as a river, meets the ocean. Therefore, both fresh water and salt water are found in the same vicinity.

How are rivers and streams related to the oceans?
-------------------------------------------------

Rivers (and to a lesser extent streams) make the point of contact of fresh water with the oceans where the mouth of a river flows into the oceans. 3. Another important influx of fresh water to the oceans is from glaciers which either melt and flow into the ocean (as they are doing more frequently now) or when they create icebergs.

What happens when river water meets sea water?
----------------------------------------------

When river water meets sea water, the lighter fresh water rises up and over the denser salt water. Sea water noses into the estuary beneath the outflowing river water, pushing its way upstream along the bottom.

Where does the salt water in the ocean come from?
-------------------------------------------------

The rocks present on the land are the origin of salt for ocean which in turn is formed by rain and carbon dioxide present in the rocks. However, rivers and lakes are the major sources of fresh water consumed by us. Can we ever think of mixing salt water with fresh water and both remaining distinct?
