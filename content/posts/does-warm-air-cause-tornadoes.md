Does warm air cause tornadoes?
------------------------------

In simple terms, tornados are formed during severe weather cycles that combine thunderstorms, colliding air masses (or fronts), a combination of cold and warm air, and high and low pressure changes. When two or more moving air masses (cold or warm fronts) collide, strong weather will develop.

Do tornadoes need humid air?
----------------------------

A tornado is a powerful column of winds that rotate around a center of low pressure. The winds inside a tornado spiral inward and upward, often exceeding speeds of 300 mph. For a thunderstorm to produce a tornado requires warm humid air near the surface with cold dry air above.

Is a tornado a mix of hot and cold air?
---------------------------------------

Tornadoes form from an extreme struggle of hot and cold air. There’s warm, moist air below and cold, dry air above, with a thin lid of stable air between. Sometimes, the warm air rushes through the lid of stable air and mixes with the cold air. An updraft and a downdraft begins and a thunderstorm forms.

Does humidity affect tornadoes?
-------------------------------

Tornadoes form when warm, humid air collides with cold, dry air. The warm air rises through the colder air, causing an updraft. The updraft will begin to rotate if winds vary sharply in speed or direction.

Where is the warm air in a tornado?
-----------------------------------

The warm air rises from the lower atmosphere causing an updraft, which mixes with the heavier cold air.

Does it get warm before a tornado?
----------------------------------

There is no particular temperature at which tornadoes form. Even if it is cold near the surface, as long as it is colder higher up, the winds are right to set up low-level wind shear, along with other necessary ingredients, a tornado is possible.

Does the temperature drop during a tornado?
-------------------------------------------

Why is the air inside the tornado’s vortex colder and thinner than the air around it? The more the pockets expand, the colder it gets, then the thinner the air gets. In the case of the 1955 tornado, the temperature dropped from 80.6 to 53.6 degrees F (27 to 12 degrees C).

Is the air rising or falling in a tornado?
------------------------------------------

Since the atmosphere is so unstable the displaced air keeps rising and a cloud quickly forms. Rain that begins to fall from the cloud causes downdrafts (sinking air) in the rear of the cloud. Meanwhile the advancing edge of the storm has strong updrafts and humid air is pulled into the storm.

What makes a tornado form in tornado season?
--------------------------------------------

Tornado Season. A tornadic thunderstorm can form where moist, warm air gets trapped beneath warm, dry air under a stable layer of cold, dry air. This air sandwich is called an inversion. If the cap is disturbed by a front or movement in the upper atmosphere, the warm, moist air can punch through the stable air above it.

Why are tornadoes so common in the Gulf of Mexico?
--------------------------------------------------

Tornadoes are so frequent in this region because the moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico frequently meets the cool, dry air from Canada, which prompts formation. Florida also sees its fair share of tornadoes thanks to its frequent thunderstorms.

What causes a tornado to not be visible?
----------------------------------------

A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli’s principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor in the air to condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling.

Why are tornadoes so common in Tornado Alley?
---------------------------------------------

Tornadoes are common in Tornado Alley because of the Rocky Mountains to the west and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. In spring, a strong westerly jet stream flows across the Alley, creating instability and a trough of low pressure that draws warm, moist air in from the Gulf.
