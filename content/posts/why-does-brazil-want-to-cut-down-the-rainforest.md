Why does Brazil want to cut down the rainforest?
------------------------------------------------

Cattle ranching is the leading cause of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. In Brazil, this has been the case since at least the 1970s: government figures attributed 38 percent of deforestation from 1966-1975 to large-scale cattle ranching. Today the figure in Brazil is closer to 70 percent.

What are the main causes of deforestation in the rainforest?
------------------------------------------------------------

The most common pressures causing deforestation and severe forest degradation are agriculture, unsustainable forest management, mining, infrastructure projects and increased fire incidence and intensity.

What did Brazil do to help the environment?
-------------------------------------------

In some ways, the world’s seventh-richest country has made remarkable environmental progress in recent years. In the past decade, Brazil reduced its CO 2 emissions by more than any other country, largely by curtailing deforestation in the Amazon basin.

How does deforestation in Brazil affect the environment?
--------------------------------------------------------

According to the Brazilian government, 62% of deforested areas become grasslands to feed cattle. Although deforestation has declined in Brazil over the last decade or so, the Brazilian government recently relaxed rules on deforestation and has limited the capacity of the federal environmental agencies that enforce those rules.

Why did Brazil want to develop the Amazon rainforest?
-----------------------------------------------------

Brazil’s foreign minister said opening the rainforest to economic development was the only way to protect it. Ernesto Araujo also hit back at criticism of Brazil’s handling of the forest fires. He told reporters in Washington that claims the country is “not able to cope with the challenges” were false.

Why do people in Brazil want to burn down trees?
------------------------------------------------

As well-off, privileged Westerners rage against Brazil for having the temerity to use its resources as it sees fit, and as they even flirt with the idea of sending outside forces to take charge of the Amazon, we can see the borderline imperialist mindset that motors so much green thinking.
