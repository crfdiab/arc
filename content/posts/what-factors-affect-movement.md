What factors affect movement?
-----------------------------

Friction is the contact force between two objects moving against each other; the kind of surface that objects have affects how objects move against each other. Gravity is the force that pulls objects down slopes or makes them fall. A force can slow down or speed up an object.

Which factor affect the movement of waves?
------------------------------------------

Wave height is affected by wind speed, wind duration (or how long the wind blows), and fetch, which is the distance over water that the wind blows in a single direction. If wind speed is slow, only small waves result, regardless of wind duration or fetch.

Which factors does not affect the movement of ocean water?
----------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following factors does not affect the movement of ocean water? Temperature. Salinity. Density.

What are the three factors of movement?
---------------------------------------

Movement can be broken into three factors: effort, time, and flow. Each factor is important and is related to the others.

What are the movement of ocean water?
-------------------------------------

Ocean water is constantly in motion: north-south, east-west, alongshore, and vertically. Seawater motions are the result of waves, tides, and currents (Figure below). Ocean movements are the consequence of many separate factors: wind, tides, Coriolis effect, water density differences, and the shape of the ocean basins.

What are the 4 factors of movement?
-----------------------------------

The four factors of movement that Laban identified (weight, space, time, and flow) became the bedrock of what became known as movement education.

What is the main factor of movement?
------------------------------------

Effort is the main factor of movement. Flow and time are both parts of effort. Effort is the all-encompassing factor. Effort combines quality, shade, passions, and inner attitudes that are communicated through movement.

What are the 12 fundamental movement skills?
--------------------------------------------

fundamental movement skills

- locomotor and non-locomotor skills — rolling, balancing, sliding, jogging, running, leaping, jumping, hopping, dodging, galloping and skipping.
- object control skills — bouncing, throwing, catching, kicking, striking. How does wind affect the movement of ocean water?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    The stronger the wind blows, the bigger the wave becomes. (d) Temperature, winds, gravitational pull of the sun, the earth and the moon; warm and cold currents are the factors that affect the movement of ocean water.
    
    What are factors that affect the height of ocean waves?
    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    (c) Winds, earthquakes, volcanic eruption or under water landslides are the factors affecting the height of the waves. The stronger the wind blows, the bigger the wave becomes. (d) Temperature, winds, gravitational pull of the sun, the earth and the moon; warm and cold currents are the factors that affect the movement of ocean water.
    
    How is the direction of the ocean current affected?
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    The ocean currents direction is also being affected by some factors. Such as, wind, depth, salinity, earth rotation, and temperature. It is also classified as a horizontal movement of ocean water. In the northern hemisphere the current will flow like a clockwise. Besides, in the southern hemisphere the current will flow counterclockwise.
    
    How are waves related to the movement of the ocean?
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    1 Waves are nothing but the oscillatory movements that result in the rise and fall of water surface. 2 Waves are a kind of horizontal movements of the ocean water. 3 They are actually the energy, not the water as such, which moves across the ocean surface. 4 This energy for the waves is provided by the wind.
