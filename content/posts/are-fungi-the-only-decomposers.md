Are fungi the only decomposers?
-------------------------------

Fungi are the only decomposers that can break down wood and the cellulose in plant cell walls, so they are the primary decomposers in forests. Many fungi are involved in symbiotic relationships.

Are fungi secondary consumers?
------------------------------

Fungi and Food Chains Primary consumers, or herbivores, eat plants, secondary consumers eat primary consumers, and even tertiary or quaternary consumers enter the food chain. At the end of the chain, fungi and other decomposers take care of the “waste” in the food chain by consuming dead plants or animals.

Is fungi a Decomposer or producer?
----------------------------------

Fungi are important decomposers, especially in forests. Some kinds of fungi, such as mushrooms, look like plants. But fungi do not contain chlorophyll, the pigment that green plants use to make their own food with the energy of sunlight.

Why are fungi the only decomposers in plants?
---------------------------------------------

Most fungi are decomposers called saprotrophs. They feed on decaying organic matter and return nutrients to the soil for plants to use. Fungi are the only decomposers that can break down wood and the cellulose in plant cell walls, so they are the primary decomposers in forests. Which fungi are not decomposers?

What kind of living thing is a decomposer?
------------------------------------------

A decomposer is a living thing that gets energy by breaking down dead plants and animals. Fungi and bacteria are the most common decomposers. Subsequently, one may also ask, is fungi a producer or consumer?

Which is the only decomposer that can break down wood?
------------------------------------------------------

Fungi are the only decomposers that can break down wood and the cellulose in plant cell walls, so they are the primary decomposers in forests. Which fungi are not decomposers?

Is the mushroom a decomposer or a producer?
-------------------------------------------

Yes, mushrooms are decomposers, like almost all types of fungi. They are heterotrophs, meaning they cannot make their own food, unlike plants. They are heterotrophs, meaning they cannot make their own food, unlike plants.
