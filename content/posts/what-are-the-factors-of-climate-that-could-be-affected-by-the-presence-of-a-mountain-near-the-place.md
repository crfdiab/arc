What are the factors of climate that could be affected by the presence of a mountain near the place?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Climate can be affected by mountains. Mountains receive more rainfall than low lying areas because as air is forced over the higher ground it cools, causing moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall. The higher the place is above sea level the colder it will be.

Why do mountains influence climate?
-----------------------------------

The mountains create a barrier to air moving eastward off the Pacific Ocean. When the moist, oceanic air encounters the mountains it begins to rise. The rising air cools as it moves up and over the mountains, and much of its moisture condenses, forming clouds and precipitation.

What are two ways that a mountain range can affect climate?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Mountains can also affect precipitation. Mountains and mountain ranges can cast a rain shadow. As winds rise up the windward side of a mountain range, the air cools and precipitation falls. On the other side of the range, the leeward side, the air is dry, and it sinks.

How does elevation impact climate?
----------------------------------

As you increase in elevation, there is less air above you thus the pressure decreases. As the pressure decreases, air molecules spread out further (i.e. air expands) and the temperature decreases. If the humidity is at 100 percent (because it’s snowing), the temperature decreases more slowly with height.

Does humidity change with elevation?
------------------------------------

On average, moisture availability (both relative humidity and absolute vapor pressure) decreases with elevation, but the seasonal and diurnal variability in relative humidity (RH) is enhanced toward the mountain summit.

How are the mountains related to the climate?
---------------------------------------------

Much of airborne moisture falls as rain on the windward side of mountains. Mountains affect climate by blocking wind and receiving more rainfall than low-lying areas. As air is forced over higher ground, it cools, causing moisture to condense and fall as rain.

How does a mountain affect the surrounding land?
------------------------------------------------

Because of the rapid changes in altitude and temperature along a mountain slope, multiple ecological zones are “stacked” upon one another sometimes ranging from dense tropical jungles to glacial ice within a few kilometres. What effect do mountains have on surrounding land? Mountains can affect the climate of nearby lands.

Why do mountains receive more rainfall than low lying areas?
------------------------------------------------------------

They receive more rainfall than low lying areas because the temperature on top of mountains is lower than the temperature at sea level. Winds carry moist air over the land.

How does wind flow through a mountain range?
--------------------------------------------

Wind flowing through mountainous areas is channeled through a tunnel effect. This causes strong winds and aggressive weather formations. The formations of mountain ranges increase the amount of high-altitude land mass, thus increasing the total land area covered by snow.
