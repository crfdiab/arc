What are the five factors of habitat?
-------------------------------------

Five essential elements must be present to provide a viable habitat: food, water, cover, space, and arrangement.

Are habitats man made?
----------------------

Habitats occur in nature, but may also be designed and fabricated by man. Both types of habitats serve as an environment in which a species can live and thrive.

What are the two factors of habitat?
------------------------------------

The two components of habitat are biotic and abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include light, temperature, water, air, soil, inorganic nutrients, etc. They are the non-living components of any habitat.

What do all habitats need?
--------------------------

All species of plants and animals— including people—need a proper combination of food, water, cover, and space to survive and reproduce. Together, these elements make up a “habitat.” Without habitat, a species cannot survive.

What is not a natural habitat?
------------------------------

Answer: zoo is not the natural habitat.

What is the habitat of a person?
--------------------------------

The term habitat comes from ecology, and includes many interrelated features, especially the immediate physical environment, the urban environment or the social environment. At the individual and family levels, one’s habitat is one’s home and the buildings in which one goes about daily life.

What is the types of habitat?
-----------------------------

Type of Habitats The two main types of habitats are terrestrial, or land habitats and aquatic, or water, habitats. Forests, deserts, grasslands, tundra, and mountains are just a few examples of terrestrial habitats. Freshwater habitats include streams, rivers, swamps, marshes, ponds, and lakes.

What is our natural habitat?
----------------------------

Natural habitats include land and water areas characterised by certain environmental conditions, and by the plant and animal species typical of such areas. Natural habitats are affected by soil and bedrock, water conditions and the microclimate, among others.

What makes a habitat a habitat for an organism?
-----------------------------------------------

A habitat is a place where an organism makes its home. A habitat meets all the environmental conditions an organism needs to survive. For an animal, that means everything it needs to find and gather food, select a mate, and successfully reproduce. For a plant, a good habitat must provide the right combination of light, air, water, and soil.

When does habitat change due to natural causes?
-----------------------------------------------

When a habitat is dramatically altered due to natural or anthropogenic activities such as earthquakes, agriculture, pollution or oil exploration, these places may no longer be able to provide shelter, food, water, or breeding grounds for the living organisms.

What is habitat and reasons for habitat loss and destruction?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Such kind of events lessens the places where plants or animals such as wildlife can live and threatens the survival of various species. That sort of habitat degradation or fragmentation is what is termed as habitat loss and destruction. Habitat loss and destruction are influenced by several drivers which include:

How are plants and animals adapted to their habitat?
----------------------------------------------------

Thus, each and every plant or animal is adapted to survive in a specific kind of habitat. For instance, some turtles live in the seas while others live on land. Some plants grow in the deserts, some in the seas, and some in swampy areas. This shows different species have different needs. Examples of habitats includeoceans, streams, or forests.
