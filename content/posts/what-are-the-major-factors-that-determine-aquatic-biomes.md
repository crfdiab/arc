What are the major factors that determine aquatic biomes?
---------------------------------------------------------

The major factors which determine aquatic biomes are dissolved oxygen, minerals, and temperature.

What two major factors are used to characterize aquatic biomes?
---------------------------------------------------------------

What two major factors are used to characterize aquatic biomes?

- Aquatic biomes are distinguished by the availability of sunlight and the concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients in the water.
- The photic zone extends to a maximum depth of 200 meters, while the aphotic zone is deeper than 200 meters.

What abiotic factors affect the ocean biome?
--------------------------------------------

Abiotic factors include sunlight, temperature, moisture, wind or water currents, soil type, and nutrient availability. Ocean ecosystems are impacted by abiotic factors in ways that may be different from terrestrial ecosystems.

What are some examples of aquatic biomes?
-----------------------------------------

For example, coral reefs are found in warm, shallow waters and are dominated by corals. Fish, invertebrates, sea urchins and other fauna are found in coral reefs. Wetlands are another example of an aquatic biome. They are standing bodies of water such as marshes and swamps.

What is the biggest abiotic factor for aquatic biomes?
------------------------------------------------------

Biotic factors include plants, animals, and microbes; important abiotic factors include the amount of sunlight in the ecosystem, the amount of oxygen and nutrients dissolved in the water, proximity to land, depth, and temperature. Sunlight is one the most important abiotic factors for marine ecosystems.

What are the abiotic factors that influence aquatic biomes?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Abiotic factors that influence aquatic biomes include light availability, depth, stratification, temperature, currents, and tides.

How are aquatic biomes different from terrestrial biomes?
---------------------------------------------------------

As with terrestrial biomes, aquatic biomes are influenced by a series of abiotic factors. However, these factors differ since water has different physical and chemical properties than does air. Even if the water in a pond or other body of water is perfectly clear (there are no suspended particles), water, on its own, absorbs light.

Why are marine biomes characteristic of the oceans?
---------------------------------------------------

Marine biomes have more salt and are characteristic of the oceans, coral reefs, and estuaries. Most aquatic organisms do not have to deal with extremes of temperature or moisture. Instead, their main limiting factors are the availability of sunlight and the concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients in the water.

How is habitat destruction affecting the marine biome?
------------------------------------------------------

Habitat destruction inside the marine biome is caused due to multiple natural occurrence but mostly human actions. Contamination, pollution, ships are some of the culprits of habitat destruction. The fact is that only an extremely small percentage of the ocean is protected. Others are open for damage.
