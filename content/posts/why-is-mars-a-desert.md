Why is Mars a desert?
---------------------

One possible explanation for the climate change is that Mars suffered a massive collision with an asteroid, which removed some of Mars’s atmosphere and shut down its dynamo (which powered the planetary magnetic field). The lack of a global magnetic field allowed the solar wind to strip the atmosphere away.

What is the desert on Mars called?

In most of the world, a Mars bar is a candy bar with nougat and caramel, coated with milk chocolate, but without almonds. In the United States it is called a Milky Way.

Which is red planet?
--------------------

Mars is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian soil oxidize, or rust, causing the soil and atmosphere to look red.

Can humans live on the Mars?
----------------------------

However, the surface is not hospitable to humans or most known life forms due to the radiation, greatly reduced air pressure, and an atmosphere with only 0.16% oxygen. Human survival on Mars would require living in artificial Mars habitats with complex life-support systems.

What kind of atmosphere does the planet Mars have?
--------------------------------------------------

Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth .

What’s the difference between Mars and the Earth?
-------------------------------------------------

Mars is a terrestrial planet. It is small and rocky. Mars has a thin atmosphere. Mars has an active atmosphere, but the surface of the planet is not active. Its volcanoes are dead. One day on Mars lasts 24.6 hours. It is just a little longer than a day on Earth.

Why is Mars a cold, cold desert?
--------------------------------

Mars Has Always Been a Cold, Cold Desert. Mars never had the thick, luxurious atmosphere required to make it a mini-Earth way back when.

Is it true that Mars was originally a dry planet?
-------------------------------------------------

But according to a study by Jonathan Lunine of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, the Red Planet was dry from the very beginning. Lunine, writing in the journal Icarus in 2003 with colleagues John Chambers, Alessandro Morbidelli, and Laurie Leshin, says that Mars was originally a planetary embryo.
