Why is oil and gas important Norway?
------------------------------------

Norway supplies between 20 and 25 per cent of the EU gas demand. Nearly all oil and gas produced on the Norwegian shelf is exported, and combined, oil and gas equals about half of the total value of Norwegian exports of goods. This makes oil and gas the most important export commodities in the Norwegian economy.

Does Norway benefit from oil and gas reserves?
----------------------------------------------

The oil and gas sector is Norway’s largest measured in terms of value added, government revenues, investments and export value. Since production started on the Norwegian continental shelf in the early 1970s, petroleum activities have contributed to around NOK 16 000 billion in current NOK to Norway’s GDP.

Why does Norway use a lot of energy?

Within the energy sector, new landfills within the petroleum sector have contributed to the energy consumption more than doubled since the 1970s. Service industries are a sector of strong growth over the last 30 years and this has led to a significant increase in energy consumption.

Are there any onshore oil and gas fields in Norway?

How much oil does Norway produce per day?
-----------------------------------------

The country is currently the 15th-largest oil producer in the world, with a production rate of 1,647,975 billion barrels per day. New developments and exploration efforts in the area are expected to increase production, but will that be enough to keep Norway’s offshore industry afloat?
