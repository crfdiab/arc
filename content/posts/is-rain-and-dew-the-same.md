Is rain and dew the same?
-------------------------

Dew is the water droplets that we find in the morning on leaves and other things outside, and usually in spring or winter when the air is cold. It is similar to rain because it forms from condensing water vapour.

What are the two main differences between dew and rain?
-------------------------------------------------------

4 Answers. Dew is condensate that forms on the surface, usually by the surface cooling to a temperature below the dew point of the air. Thus the water vapr accumulates onto the surface. Rain is formed by Collision-Coalescence or the Bergeron-Findelsen process.

What is the difference between dew drop and rain drop?
------------------------------------------------------

As nouns the difference between raindrop and dewdrop is that raindrop is a single droplet of rainwater that has just fallen or is falling from the sky while dewdrop is a droplet of water formed as dew.

What exactly is dew?
--------------------

Dew is a natural form of water, formed as water vapor condenses. Colder air is less able to hold water vapor than warm air. This forces water vapor in the air around cooling objects to condense. When condensation happens, small water droplets form—dew. The temperature at which dew forms is called the dew point.

What dew point does it rain?
----------------------------

Relative humidity DO NOT need to reach 100% in order for condensation and rain to take place. As long as the actual temperature drops to below the dew point temperature with enough water vapor in the air, cloud formation and rain can occur.

How does dew affect the weather?
--------------------------------

The dew point is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to (at constant pressure) in order to achieve a relative humidity (RH) of 100%. The higher the dew point rises, the greater the amount of moisture in the air. This directly affects how “comfortable” it will feel outside.

What kind of noun is dew?
-------------------------

(uncountable) Any moisture from the atmosphere condensed by cool bodies upon their surfaces. (countable, but see usage notes) An instance of such moisture settling on plants, etc. There was a heavy dew this morning.
