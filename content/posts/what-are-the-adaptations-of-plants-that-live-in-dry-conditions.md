What are the adaptations of plants that live in dry conditions?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Plants that are adapted to very dry environments are called xerophytes. Their adaptations may help them increase water intake, decrease water loss, or store water when it is available.

What adaptations do desert plants have?
---------------------------------------

How plants adapt to arid conditions

- thick, waxy skin to reduce loss of water and to reflect heat.
- large, fleshy stems to store water.
- thorns and thin, spiky or glossy leaves to reduce water loss.
- spikes protect cacti from animals wishing to use stored water.
- deep roots to tap groundwater.

Which of these is an example of an adaptation?
----------------------------------------------

Answer: Camouflage, mimicry, and animals’ body parts and coverings are physical adaptations.

What are adaptations of a cactus?
---------------------------------

A cactus has special adaptations in its roots, leaves as well as stems that enable it to thrive in desert environments. These adaptations include – spines, shallow roots, deep-layer stomata, thick and expandable stem, waxy skin and a short growing season.

How are desert plants adapted to survive in the desert?
-------------------------------------------------------

The mesquite plants have creatively adapted to the dry conditions by growing the longest roots than any other desert plant. Cacti use a shallow root system that extensively reaches outward to cover as much ground as it’s able. This allows the cactus to take in as much water as possible in a short amount of time.

How are some plants adapted to store water?
-------------------------------------------

Water storage – some plants, known as succulents, store water in their stems, leaves, roots or even fruits. Plants which store water in their leaves and stems also have a thick waxy skin so that they lose less water by transpiration. Cactuses have spines to reduce water loss.

Why do deciduous plants shed their leaves in the desert?
--------------------------------------------------------

They trap moisture near the plant. Deciduous plants lose their leaves for part of the year, this is convenient for desert plants because that means less water loss. An example is the Ocotillo plant, which sheds its leaves during the dry and hot months and then will regrow them in the cooler months.

How are alpine sunflowers adapted to live in the desert?
--------------------------------------------------------

Wooly leaves and stems provide insulation and buffer the wind. Alpine sunflowers are bright yellow like the true sunflowers of the Helianthus family. Alpine flower heads face East throughout the day, instead of following the sun like Helianthus do, as an adaptation from strong afternoon thunderstorms rolling out of the west.
