Where did the Pilgrims actually land and why?
---------------------------------------------

True, the Pilgrims did land at Plymouth, dubbing it originally ‘New Plymouth,” since they departed from Plymouth, England. But Plymouth was not the Pilgrims’ first landing spot in the New World. Five weeks before coming ashore in Plymouth, the Pilgrims docked in at what is today Provincetown Harbor.

Why did the Pilgrims land so far north?
---------------------------------------

Several times, the wind was so strong they had to just drift where the weather took them, it was not safe to use the ship’s sails. The Pilgrims intended to land in Northern Virginia, which at the time included the region as far north as the Hudson River in the modern State of New York.

Where did the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony land?
---------------------------------------------------

Two months later, the three-masted merchant ship landed on the shores of Cape Cod, in present-day Massachusetts. In late December, the Mayflower anchored at Plymouth Rock, where the pilgrims formed the first permanent settlement of Europeans in New England.

Why did the Pilgrims leave England?
-----------------------------------

The big reason why did the Pilgrims leave England is to be able to live out their religious convictions. They left and went on what we may call a religious pilgrimage. Freedom of religion, as a fundamental, is the root of the cause why did the Pilgrims leave England. They were separatists from the Anglican Church.

Where were the pilgrims really going?
-------------------------------------

In the early period of Hebrew history, pilgrims traveled to Shiloh, Dan, Bethel, and eventually Jerusalem (see also Three Pilgrimage Festivals, a practice followed by other Abrahamic religions ). While many pilgrims travel toward a specific location, a physical destination is not always a necessity.

Where did the Pilgrims first land in America?
---------------------------------------------

The Pilgrims sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to reach North America. They sailed on a ship named the Mayflower. On December 11, 1620, the first Pilgrims (or Puritans, as they were first known) landed at Plymouth Rock.

Did the pilgrims intend to land at Plymouth?
--------------------------------------------

The Pilgrims aboard the Mayflower were supposed to land in northern Virginia in November of 1620, but they landed farther north near what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts. Realizing that they would not have a government over them, they drafted the Mayflower Compact as a guide to living so as to avoid anarchy.
