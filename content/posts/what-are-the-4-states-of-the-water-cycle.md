What are the 4 states of the water cycle?
-----------------------------------------

There are four main stages in the water cycle. They are evaporation, condensation, precipitation and collection. Let’s look at each of these stages. Evaporation: This is when warmth from the sun causes water from oceans, lakes, streams, ice and soils to rise into the air and turn into water vapour (gas).

What are the three states of water cycle?
-----------------------------------------

The water cycle is the path that all water follows as it moves around our planet. On Earth, you can find water in all three states of matter: solid, liquid and gas. Liquid water is found in Earth’s oceans, rivers, lakes, streams—and even in the soil and underground.

What is water in the water cycle?
---------------------------------

The water cycle shows the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. Liquid water evaporates into water vapor, condenses to form clouds, and precipitates back to earth in the form of rain and snow. Water in different phases moves through the atmosphere (transportation).

How do the water phases appear in the water cycle?
--------------------------------------------------

Through evaporation, water moves from hydrosphere to atmosphere. As water evaporates it reduces the temperature of the bodies. As water vaporizes into water vapor, it rises up in the atmosphere. At high altitudes the water vapors changes into very tiny particles of ice /water droplets because of low temperature.

What is natural water cycle?
----------------------------

The natural water cycle is the continuous movement of water around the world through the processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, run-off, infiltration and percolation.

Where is liquid water found in the water cycle?
-----------------------------------------------

The Short Answer: The water cycle is the path that all water follows as it moves around Earth in different states. Liquid water is found in oceans, rivers, lakes—and even underground. Solid ice is found in glaciers, snow, and at the North and South Poles. Water vapor—a gas—is found in Earth’s atmosphere. Water can be found all over Earth in the …

Is the earth’s water cycle always in movement?
----------------------------------------------

Status: Active The Fundamentals of the Water Cycle Earth’s water is always in movement, and the natural water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth.

How does the water cycle respond to the Sun?
--------------------------------------------

These continuous changes in state create a cycle of repeating events. Water continually circulates between the surface of Earth and its atmosphere in what is called the hydrologic or water cycle. Responding to heat energy from the Sun, water in oceans, lakes, swamps, rivers, plants and even in your body can turn into water vapor.

How does the atmosphere contribute to the water cycle?
------------------------------------------------------

Downloadable Water Cycle Products (coming soon!) The atmosphere is the superhighway in the sky that moves water everywhere over the Earth. Water at the Earth’s surface evaporates into water vapor which rises up into the sky to become part of a cloud which will float off with the winds, eventually releasing water back to Earth as precipitation.
