What are the contribution of Louis Pasteur?
-------------------------------------------

He pioneered the study of molecular asymmetry; discovered that microorganisms cause fermentation and disease; originated the process of pasteurization; saved the beer, wine, and silk industries in France; and developed vaccines against anthrax and rabies.

What did Pasteur discover?
--------------------------

Louis Pasteur. During the mid- to late 19th century Pasteur demonstrated that microorganisms cause disease and discovered how to make vaccines from weakened, or attenuated, microbes. He developed the earliest vaccines against fowl cholera, anthrax, and rabies.

What was the impact of Pasteur’s vaccines?
------------------------------------------

By passing the virus through rabbits, Pasteur made the virus less dangerous to human hosts, while still giving the body enough information to recognize the antigen and develop immunity to the “wild” version of the disease.

What did Louis Pasteur discover 1862?
-------------------------------------

In 1862, a French chemist named Louis Pasteur discovered that heat kills germs in liquids, preventing bacterial growth, food spoilage and foodborne illnesses. Pasteur’s research also showed that the growth of micro-organisms was responsible for spoiling beverages, such as beer, wine and milk.

What kind of awards did Louis Pasteur win?
------------------------------------------

Check all the awards nominated and won by Louis Pasteur. (For his researches on fermentation and on pelerine.) (For his discovery of the nature of racemic acid and its relations to polarized light, and for the researches to which he was led by that discovery.)

How old was Louis Pasteur when he died?
---------------------------------------

Louis Pasteur (/ˈluːi pæˈstɜːr/, French: \[lwi pastœʁ\]; December 27, 1822 – September 28, 1895) was a French biologist, microbiologist and chemist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation and pasteurization.

Where did Louis Pasteur go to high school?
------------------------------------------

Louis attended and graduated from Ecole Normal in France. He studied sciences. Louis married Marie Laurent and they had five children. Louis began his work as a professor, and one of his duties included finding scientific solutions to common problems in the area.

How did Louis Pasteur get credit for his discoveries?
-----------------------------------------------------

Toussaint developed the vaccine for anthrax, and shared his discoveries with Pasteur. Pasteur then turned around and presented the findings in a public demonstration in 1881, and he neglected to give Toussaint any credit whatsoever. He also went on to get a patent for the vaccine, again without any mention of Toussaint.
