What happens during a half moon?
--------------------------------

The first quarter and third quarter moons (both often called a “half moon”), happen when the moon is at a 90 degree angle with respect to the earth and sun. So we are seeing exactly half of the moon illuminated and half in shadow. After the full moon (maximum illumination), the light continually decreases.

What is a half moon known as?
-----------------------------

First Quarter Moon is the second primary Moon phase and it is defined as the moment the Moon has reached the first quarter of its orbit around Earth, hence the name. It is also called Half Moon as we can see exactly 50% of the Moon’s surface illuminated.

What is a 1/2 moon called?
--------------------------

The last quarter moon (or a half moon) is when half of the lit portion of the Moon is visible after the waning gibbous phase. A waning crescent moon is when the Moon looks like a crescent and the crescent decreases (“wanes”) in size from one day to the next.

How does the Half Moon look?
----------------------------

There’s no half-moon phase, at least not in any official way. Invariably, when referring to a half moon, observers are looking at a quarter moon. You see a moon that looks half-illuminated, like half a pie. Full moon signifies that the full visible surface of the moon – its day side – is fully turned toward Earth.

When the moon is half dark and half light?
------------------------------------------

Typically, one-half of the Moon will be lit up by the Sun, while the half facing away from the Sun remains dark. (The only exception occurs during a lunar eclipse, when the Earth blocks the light falling on the lit side of the Moon.)…General Astronomy/Phases of the Moon.

When does the Moon look half as bright as a full moon?
------------------------------------------------------

Believe it or not, the moon is half as bright as a full moon about 2.4 days before and after a full moon. Even though about 95 percent of the moon is illuminated at this time, and to most casual observers it might still look like a “full” moon, its brightness is roughly 0.7 magnitudes less than at full phase, making it appear one-half as bright.
