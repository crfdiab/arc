How many wolverines are left in the world?
------------------------------------------

300 wolverines  
Ten groups want to force the federal government to protect the elusive wolverines. The groups estimate there are around 300 wolverines left, sparsely scattered across the Mountain West, including Idaho, Washington and Oregon. Their young depend on snowy, high altitude habitat that could disappear as the climate warms.

Where is the highest population of wolverines?
----------------------------------------------

The wolverine is found primarily in remote reaches of the Northern boreal forests and subarctic and alpine tundra of the Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest numbers in Northern Canada, the U.S. state of Alaska, the mainland Nordic countries of Europe, and throughout western Russia and Siberia.

How many wolverines live in America?
------------------------------------

In the contiguous United States, wolverines are restricted to high-elevation habitats in the Rocky Mountains containing the arctic and subarctic conditions they require. It is estimated that there are fewer than 400 animals in the contiguous United States.

Where are wolverines in Canada?
-------------------------------

Historically, Wolverines were found throughout most of Ontario. Today, they are primarily found in the northwest boreal forest and coastal tundra; however, recent studies show some re-colonization of their historical northeastern range.

Can you kill wolverines in Canada?
----------------------------------

Under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act , the hunting and trapping of Wolverine is prohibited. As a result and because the species occurs in low densities, Wolverine populations are particularly vulnerable to incidental trapping events which can result in mortalities.

How many Wolverines are there in the world?
-------------------------------------------

The worlds total wolverine population is unknown. The animal exhibits a low population density and requires a very large home range.

What is the population of Wolverines in Sweden?
-----------------------------------------------

The population has increased since protection. Based on records of active natal dens during 1995-97, the population was estimated at a minimum of 265 individuals in all of Sweden, with almost 200 of these in the northernmost county (Norrbotten).

What is the population density of Wolverines in Canada?
-------------------------------------------------------

From their estimates of 5.1–7.8 wolverines/1000 km 2 for two study areas, they used wolverine habitat ratings to develop a range of density estimates for the entire province of 0.3–6.2 wolverines/1000 km 2.

What is the population density of Wolverines in Alaska?
-------------------------------------------------------

Magoun et al. (2010) used a remote camera array and a spatial capture-recapture model to estimate 9.7 (5.9–15.0) wolverines/1000 km 2 in southeast Alaska. In Scandinavia, wolverine density based on the average number of active den sites (Landa et al. 1998) was estimated at 10–14 wolverines/1000 km 2 (Persson et al.
