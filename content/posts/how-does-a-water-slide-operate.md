How does a water slide operate?
-------------------------------

A typical water slide uses a pump system to pump water to the top which is then allowed to freely flow down its surface. The water reduces friction so sliders travel down the slide very quickly. Water slides run into a swimming pool (often called a plunge pool) or a long run-out chute.

How do log flumes work?
-----------------------

Passengers sit in the logs, which are propelled along the flume by the flow of water. The ride usually culminates with a rapid descent and splashdown into a body of water, which may happen more than once (normally the largest drop being just before the end).

Why does water slide off skin?
------------------------------

Why does water slide off skin? It is easy to see that the drop seems to have a “skin” holding it into a sort of flattened sphere. It turns out that this surface tension is the result of the tendency of water molecules to attract one another (called cohesion).

Why do you move faster on a water slide than a normal slide?
------------------------------------------------------------

One is the slope of the slide, which affects a rider’s speed: The steeper the slide, the faster you go. Another is curves, which change a rider’s direction. Slopes and curves on a waterslide mean more acceleration. And more acceleration means more fun.

Are log rides dangerous?
------------------------

Log flumes are one of the more popular rides at amusement parks. These rides also pose quite a risk due to the fact that there are usually no safety belts or lap bars in the hollowed-out logs or boats to protect riders as they plunge down the water flume.

What is the longest log flume in the world?
-------------------------------------------

Kings River Flume  
The longest log flume was reputedly the Kings River Flume in Sanger, California. Built in 1890 by the Kings River Lumber Company, it spanned over 62 miles (100 km) from the Sierra Nevada to the lumber yard and railroad depot in Sanger.

How do you go down a waterslide fast?
-------------------------------------

To go fast, I needed to minimize the surface area of skin and suit making contact with the slide. Basic speed-chuting position involves crossing your ankles, tensing your core, and arching your back so that there are only three points of contact with the slide: the shoulder blades and a single heel.

Are water parks full of germs?
------------------------------

However, water parks are full of germs, potentially dangerous, and can be just as crowded as amusement parks on their worst days.

Has anyone fallen off a water slide?
------------------------------------

At 169 feet tall, Verrückt was the tallest waterslide in the world. That is, until August 7, 2016, when the raft that 10-year-old Caleb Schwab was riding went airborne and hit a metal pole supporting a safety net, resulting in his decapitation and instant death.

How are water slides made and why do they work?
-----------------------------------------------

While each type of slide works a little differently, all water slides are fundamentally a product of three forces: gravity, friction, and inertia. Gravity forces passengers down the ride, while water acts as a lubricant to reduce friction, so the ride is fast and smooth. On rides with a lot of curves, inertia comes into play.

How does water affect the riders on a waterslide?
-------------------------------------------------

He lists the forces acting on riders on a waterslide: gravity, of course, but also the friction between your body and the slide (or the tube you’re on and the slide) and how the water interacts with the slide itself. “Water acts as a lubricant between you and the slide,” he says. “But it also pushes you along like a river.

What do you need to know about water rides?
-------------------------------------------

The ride vehicles, stations, and ride paths can be themed to fit into any narrative or storyline. Our in-house team of artists skillfully hand sculpt your thematic elements. Add variety to your park’s ride mix and guest experience with the classic appeal of water ride splash entertaining guests across age-groups.

How does a raft work on a water slide?
--------------------------------------

Since different materials can generate different amounts of friction as they rub against the slide (cotton for example, will create more friction than a pair of spandex trunks) a raft is used to control friction as a variable. The result is an exhilarating ride that is perfect to share with friends and family. 3. Mega Storm
