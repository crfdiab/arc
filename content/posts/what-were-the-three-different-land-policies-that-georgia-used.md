What were the three different land policies that Georgia used?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Land Policies in Georgia. Evaluate the impact of land policies pursued by Georgia; include the headright system, land lotteries, and the Yazoo land fraud. After the Revolutionary War, Georgia gained access to a large amount of land from the Native Americans who sided with the British.

Which land policy in Georgia did the government gave the head of a family up to 200 acres of free land in the Georgia frontier?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the headright system  
Until 1803, Georgia distributed land according to the headright system. All heads of household were entitled to 200 acres, plus 50 acres per family member (including slaves), up to a limit of 1000 acres. The headright system resulted in massive immigration to Georgia.

Which of these was the first land policy adopted in Georgia during westward expansion?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first approach employed was called the headright system. By 1783, under this system, Georgia gave thousands of acres of land to soldiers who had fought during the Revolution. Under this system, men who did not fight in the Revolution could also receive free land.

What was Georgiaâ€™s first land policy called?
--------------------------------------------

Georgia land lotteries  
The Georgia land lotteries were an early nineteenth century system of land redistribution in Georgia. Under this system, white male citizens could register for a chance to win lots of land that had (and in most cases recently) been stolen from the Creek Indians and the Cherokee Nation.

Why were land lottery plots different sizes in different parts of Georgia?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Land Spaces Land lots were surveyed in five different sizes based on the perceived quality of the land. In the 1832 Land Lottery area, land lots were 160 acres (0.6 km2), while in the 1832 Gold Lottery area, land lots were 40 acres (0.2 km2).

Why did Georgia give away land?
-------------------------------

The Headright system was set up so that the head of the house (mainly the father or husband of the house hold) could own up to 1000 acres of land with his family. This helped poor white settlers. Georgia had much land to give away, because they had the land of the states Alabama and Mississippi.

How did Georgia lose all of its land?
-------------------------------------

However, in time Georgia loses all of this land due to the first fraud in US history. After Georgia loses land from the Yazoo Land Fraud, Georgia no longer had a lot of land to give away. With not much land, Georgia opened what was called land lotteries.

What was the US land policy in the beginning?
---------------------------------------------

From the beginning land policy was predicated on the dispossession of the native peoples. Given the unique American circumstances, early government land policies reflected the tentative, innovative, and idealistic nature of the new Republic, and some practices persisted and became distinctive features of U.S. land policy.

What was the result of the Land Act of 1795?
--------------------------------------------

Added incentive came through a series of Indian land cession treaties that followed hostilities and afforded the opening up of more land for sale and settlement, including the 1795 Treaty of Greenville. At this point, Pennsylvania Democratic congressman Albert Gallatin took a leading role in reformulating what would become the Land Act of 1796.
