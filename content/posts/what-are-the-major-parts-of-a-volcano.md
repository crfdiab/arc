What are the major parts of a volcano?
--------------------------------------

The three main parts of a volcano are the chamber, the vent, and the crater. The chamber is where the magma is stored.

What are all the parts of volcano?
----------------------------------

Sill – A flat piece of rock formed when magma hardens in a crack in a volcano. Vent – An opening in Earth’s surface through which volcanic materials escape. Lava – Molten rock that erupts from a volcano that solidifies as it cools. Crater – Mouth of a volcano – surrounds a volcanic vent.

What is the bottom of the volcano called?
-----------------------------------------

Crater: In addition to cone structures, volcanic activity can also lead to circular depressions (aka. A volcanic crater is typically a basin, circular in form, which can be large in radius and sometimes great in depth. In these cases, the lava vent is located at the bottom of the crater.

What are the three main parts of a volcano?
-------------------------------------------

There are three types of volcanoes: cinder cones, stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes. The magma chamber is a hollow within the volcano where magma and gases accumulate. During an eruption, these volcanic materials move from the magma chamber toward the surface via a pipe-like passageway called a conduit.

What do you need to know about volcanoes?
-----------------------------------------

A volcano is defined as an opening in the Earth’s crust through which lava, ash, and gases erupt. The term also includes the cone-shaped landform built by repeated eruptions over time. Teach your students about volcanoes with this collection of engaging material.

How big is the main vent of a volcano?
--------------------------------------

The main channel through which the hot magma moves to reach the Earth’s surface is called a main vent. To reach the Earth’s surface, the main vent can be several miles long, having one end connected to the magma chamber and one reaching the surface. During volcanic eruption, most of the lava ejects through the main vent.

What makes up the throat of a volcano?
--------------------------------------

Crater – Mouth of a volcano – surrounds a volcanic vent. Conduit – An underground passage magma travels through. Throat – Entrance of a volcano. The part of the conduit that ejects lava and volcanic ash. Ash – Fragments of lava or rock smaller than 2 mm in size that are blasted into the air by volcanic explosions.
