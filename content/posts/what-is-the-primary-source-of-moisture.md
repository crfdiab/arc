What is the primary source of moisture?
---------------------------------------

In order for precipitation to form, particularly over a large area, several ingredients are necessary. First there must be a source of moisture. The primary moisture sources in the U.S. are the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as the Gulf of Mexico.

Where does most moisture come from?
-----------------------------------

Moisture in the air, or humidity, is water in gas form. This is known as water vapor, and it comes from the evaporation of water from bodies such as…

How much moisture is in the atmosphere?
---------------------------------------

One estimate of global water distribution

<table><tr><th>Water source</th><th>Water volume, in cubic miles</th><th>Percent of total water</th></tr><tr><td>Atmosphere</td><td>3,094</td><td>0.001%</td></tr><tr><td>Total global fresh water</td><td>8,404,000</td><td>2.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Total global water</td><td>332,500,000</td><td>100%</td></tr></table>

What are the five different ways that moisture can find a way into buildings?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Water gets into buildings through (1) bulk pathways, (2) capillarity, (3) being carried as vapor through air, and (4) vapor diffusion.

How does moisture move into and out of a building?
--------------------------------------------------

Movement of Moist Air (Mass Transport): Because of air pressure differences, air moves into and out of building walls due to wind action, stack effect, or due to the action of mechanical ventilation. Mass transport of water through air movement is potentially the second most important mechanism for moisture intrusion into building walls and roofs.

Why is soil moisture important to the atmosphere?
-------------------------------------------------

Soil moisture is an important variable in land-atmosphere feedbacks at weather and climate time scales because of its major effect on the partitioning of incoming radiation (available energy) into latent and sensible heat and on the allocation of precipitation into runoff, subsurface flow, and infiltration.

Where does surface soil moisture 1km cover?
-------------------------------------------

The Surface Soil Moisture 1km Version 1 product (SSM1km) covers continental Europe (“CEURO”), as in the example figure below, left.

Where can I find data on soil moisture?
---------------------------------------

SSM 1km and soil moisture in Volumetric Soil Moisture \[m³/m³\] from RSMN (Romania – top) and TERENO (Germany – bottom) networks over the year 2015. Periods with frozen conditions show no data.
