How are annelids useful to humans?
----------------------------------

In addition to improving soil fertility, annelids serve humans as food and as bait. Scientists observe annelids to monitor the quality of marine and fresh water.

What is the economic importance of annelids?
--------------------------------------------

Originally Answered: How are annelids economically important? Earth worms are particularly important in agrarian economics. They aerate the soil allow mositure to penetrate to plant roots. Their tunnels act as water storage, which is important when rain is scarce.

Are annelids successful in the terrestrial environment?
-------------------------------------------------------

The Phylum Annelida is one of the three major invertebrate phyla, which have successfully evolved on land as well as in the sea. Class Polychaeta: marine annelids; Class Oligochaeta: marine, freshwater and terrestrial annelids including earthworms; Class Hirudinea: marine, fresh water and terrestrial leeches.

What is the habitat of annelids?
--------------------------------

Annelids are found worldwide in all types of habitats, especially oceanic waters, fresh waters, and damp soils. Most polychaetes live in the ocean, where they either float, burrow, wander on the bottom, or live in tubes they construct; their colours range from brilliant to dull, and some species can produce light.

What are two characteristics of annelids?
-----------------------------------------

Characteristics of Phylum Annelida

- They have a long and segmented body.
- Annelids are bilaterally symmetrical.
- They are triploblastic.
- Also, they exhibit organ system grade of organisation, showing organ differentiation.
- The body is covered with a thin cuticle.
- They are coelomate.

What is the most significant ecological role of annelids?
---------------------------------------------------------

However, probably the most significant ecological role played by annelids is reworking of soil and sediments. Soils may harbor 50 to 500 earthworms per square meter; they keep soils aerated, and their castings fertilize the soil. Most earthworms and leeches are hermaphroditic with both male and female gonads.

What is the economic importance of tapeworm?
--------------------------------------------

The economic importance of the fringed tapeworm is due primarily to its effect on the bile ducts of the liver, which become enlarged and inflamed and make the liver unfit for human food.

What are the economic importance of bacteria?
---------------------------------------------

Bacteria are economically important as these microorganisms are used by humans for many purposes. The beneficial uses of bacteria include the production of traditional foods such as yogurt, cheese, and vinegar. Microbes are also important in agriculture for the compost and fertilizer production.

What are the two benefits of Metamerism?
----------------------------------------

What are the advantages of metamerism 1. Redundancy-repetition of parts means that if the organs in one segment fail, there are other segments that may still be functional 2. Reproduction-Loss of segments containing reproductive cells does not destroy the animal–example of the palolo worm of the South Pacific.

What are 3 characteristics of annelids?
---------------------------------------

What are the main features of annelids?
---------------------------------------

Characteristics of Annelida: Plesiomorphies and Other Features

- Symmetry and Size. Annelids are all bilaterally symmetrical animals.
- Coelom.
- Body wall.
- Parapodia.
- Nervous system.
- Sense organs.
- Circulation and respiratory structures.
- Segmental organs. What are two ways humans have used annelids?
    --------------------------------------------
    
    They are a source of food for many birds, mammals, and other invertebrates. Other annelids, such as the lugworms of the class Polychaetae, contribute to human food sources as well. We use these species as bait to catch fish.
    
    Why are annelids important to the marine ecosystem?
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    The burrowing of marine polychaetes, which may constitute up to a third of all species in near-shore environments, encourages the development of ecosystems by enabling water and oxygen to penetrate the sea floor. In addition to improving soil fertility, annelids serve humans as food and as bait.
    
    What kind of animals are annelids and arthropods?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    Annelids are members of the protostomes, one of the two major superphyla of bilaterian animals – the other is the deuterostomes, which includes vertebrates. Within the protostomes, annelids used to be grouped with arthropods under the super-group Articulata (“jointed animals”), as segmentation is obvious in most members of both phyla.
    
    What makes an annelid different from other invertebrate phyla?
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    
    No single feature distinguishes Annelids from other invertebrate phyla, but they have a distinctive combination of features.
    
    Where does the respiration take place in an annelid?
    ----------------------------------------------------
    
    In some annelids, including earthworms, all respiration is via the skin. However, many polychaetes and some clitellates (the group to which earthworms belong) have gills associated with most segments, often as extensions of the parapodia in polychaetes.
