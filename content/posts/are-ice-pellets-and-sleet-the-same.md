Are ice pellets and sleet the same?
-----------------------------------

Sleet are small ice particles that form from the freezing of liquid water drops, such as raindrops. Sleet is also called ice pellets. Hail is frozen precipitation that can grow to very large sizes through the collection of water that freezes onto the hailstone’s surface.

What is sleet a mixture of?
---------------------------

A mixture of rain and snow or hail. To shower sleet. Precipitation that falls to earth in the form of frozen or partially frozen raindrops, often when the temperature is near the freezing point. Sleet usually leaves the cloud in the form of snow that melts as it passes through warm layers of air during its descent.

Is sleet made of ice?
---------------------

Sleet is made up of ice pellets that bounce off objects.

Is sleet A mixture of rain and snow?
------------------------------------

Many people use the term sleet when referring to the mix of rain and snow that you sometimes see when a line of warm and cold air masses meet. Sleet starts out as snowflakes high in the clouds, then falls through a warm layer of air, where it melts and turns into partially melted snowflakes and raindrops.

How do we get sleet?
--------------------

It simply falls as snow. Under these conditions, when the falling snow reaches the layer of warm air, it melts. Then it hits the layer of cold air just above Earth’s surface and refreezes. This all happens very fast, and the result is tiny ice pellets called sleet.

What is frozen rain called?
---------------------------

ice storm  
A significant accumulation of freezing rain lasting several hours or more is called an ice storm.

Will rain melt sleet?
---------------------

As snow falls into the layer of air where the temperature is above freezing, the snow flakes partially melt. The rain falls back into the air that is below freezing but since the depth is shallow, the rain does not have time to freeze into sleet.

What’s the difference between snow, rain and sleet?
---------------------------------------------------

As long as air temperatures are above freezing (32 F), rain can fall. While we tend to think of snow and ice as two different things, snow is actually millions of tiny ice crystals that collect and form into flakes, which we know as snowflakes .

What’s the difference between freezing rain and ice pellets?
------------------------------------------------------------

The forecast for tonight calls for a mix of snow (north of Houston), freezing rain and ice pellets. So what’s the difference between these various forms of frozen precipitation? There’s a graphic for that, from the National Weather Service: Sleet is also called ice pellets.

How big is the ice pellets in sleet?
------------------------------------

According to experts, if one wants to define sleet, then it can be explained as transparent ice pellets. The shape of these ice pellets is usually globular and their diameter is usually around 5 mm or 0.2 inches. The size of sleet can also be smaller as it is formed as a result of freezing raindrops or the freezing of mostly melted snowflakes.

Which is more dangerous freezing rain or sleet?
-----------------------------------------------

Sleet is also called ice pellets. Of the various forms of precipitation, freezing rain is probably the most dangerous as it will ice roads most quickly.
