What are two negative effects of too much acid in nature?
---------------------------------------------------------

Acid rain and fog also damage forests, especially those at higher elevations. The acid deposits rob the soil of essential nutrients such as calcium and cause aluminum to be released in the soil, which makes it hard for trees to take up water. Trees’ leaves and needles are also harmed by acids.

How can the effects of acid rain be reversed?
---------------------------------------------

A great way to reduce acid rain is to produce energy without using fossil fuels. Instead, people can use renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. Renewable energy sources help reduce acid rain because they produce much less pollution.

How is acid rain harmful to the environment?
--------------------------------------------

The ecological effects of acid rain are most clearly seen in aquatic environments, such as streams, lakes, and marshes where it can be harmful to fish and other wildlife. As it flows through the soil, acidic rain water can leach aluminum from soil clay particles and then flow into streams and lakes. The more acid that is introduced …

How does acid rain affect lakes and rivers?
-------------------------------------------

Lakes that do not normally have a high level of acidity may temporarily experience effects of acid rain when the melting snow or downpour brings greater amounts of acidic deposition and the soil can’t buffer it.

What’s the history of acid rain and its effects?
------------------------------------------------

1\. History and background on acid rain and this special issue and vapor. Acid rain was ﬁrst recognized by Ducros (1845) and sub- environmental effects ( Smith, 1872). Smith’s work was largely America, and Australia ( Gorham, 1961). Our modern understanding and colleagues ( Likens and Bormann, 1974). These scientists and

How does acid rain affect snow and fog?
---------------------------------------

Acid Rain Effects Acid rain is rain that contains nitric and sulfuric acid. Snow and fog can also contain nitric and sulfuric acid, and the dangerous effects are the same whether the acid is falling to the earth by rain or snow, or dancing in the air via fog.
