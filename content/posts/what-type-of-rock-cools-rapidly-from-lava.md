What type of rock cools rapidly from lava?
------------------------------------------

When lava comes out of a volcano and solidifies into extrusive igneous rock, also called volcanic, the rock cools very quickly.

Which example of igneous rock is from rapidly cooling lava?
-----------------------------------------------------------

basalts  
They are the most widespread of all the igneous rocks. Most basalts are volcanic in origin and were formed by the rapid cooling and hardening of the lava flows. Some basalts are intrusive having cooled inside the Earth’s interior.

What is the name of the igneous rock that is black and has a glassy appearance because it cooled quickly?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obsidian  
Obsidian: Those rocks are intrusive. They cool slowly underground, so they have thousands of years to form crystals. With so many crystals, they can’t be shiny glass like me.

When sediments are pushed together to form a rock?
--------------------------------------------------

Does pumice cool quickly or slowly?
-----------------------------------

The vesicles are actually gas bubbles that were trapped in the rock during the rapid cooling of a gas-rich frothy magma. The material cools so quickly that atoms in the melt are not able to arrange themselves into a crystalline structure. Thus, pumice is an amorphous volcanic glass known as a “mineraloid.”

What kind of rock is made of lava?
----------------------------------

In this case, the chemical reaction causes the lava to turn into a type of igneous rock that is uncrystallized—just like glass. Glass is actually neither a solid nor a liquid, but has a non-crystalline physical structure somewhere between the two. This glass created by lava can come in many forms, the most popular being pumice or obsidian.

Why does a lava rock have a glassy surface?
-------------------------------------------

The freshness of the iridescent glassy surface and the cooling time of the rock determine the luster and color. When molten lava chills quickly, a thin, glassy rind forms on the exposed surfaces because crystallization of the minerals in the melt could not take place in such a short time.

Why are the rocks in a lava flow black?
---------------------------------------

Rocks that cool quickly, especially the outer layers of a flow, are primarily composed of glass particles and tiny mafic minerals. This is why the outer surface of a flow is black. If you look at a road cut where the interior of a flow is exposed, you will see that the rocks are mainly gray and have a waxy luster.

Which is the lightest rock obsidian or pumice?
----------------------------------------------

Obsidian is usually not very light. It’s specific gravity is about 2.4 which is somewhat lighter than most igneous rocks but not much. Sometimes obsidian is mixed with pumice and that would certainly make it lighter. Obsidian is volcanic glass. The reason it is glassy is because it has no crystal structure.
