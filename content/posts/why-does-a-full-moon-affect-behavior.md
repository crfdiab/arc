Why is there a Full Moon Tomorrow Night?
----------------------------------------

Everyone knows that. Right? People have theorized for thousands of years that the Moon has all kinds of impacts on us. It affects fertility, crime rates, dog attacks, and increases blood loss during surgery. It must be a full Moon, they say. Full moon tomorrow night! All the crazies will be out! they say. So what causes all this moon madness.
