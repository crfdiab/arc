What is the apparent magnitude m of Zeta in Taurus?
---------------------------------------------------

Zeta Tauri (ζ Tauri, abbreviated Zeta Tau, ζ Tau) is a binary star in the zodiac constellation of Taurus, the Bull. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.0, which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye.

Where can I find a Gemini?
--------------------------

During the first couple of months of the year, Gemini can most easily be found by first locating the two brightest stars in Orion (a constellation which looks like a huge hour glass) and the two brightest stars in Canis Major and Canis Minor (the “dog” stars) that follow Orion.

What color is Epsilon geminorum?
--------------------------------

Epsilon Geminorum is radiating around 8,500 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 4,662 K. It is this temperature that gives it the yellow-hued glow of a G-type star.

How many light years away is Earth in a year?
---------------------------------------------

In February 2017, astronomers detected seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a single star 40 light-years away from Earth. It’s exciting news, but it begs the question: just how far away is that? As we established above, light travels 9,460,528,000,000 km in a year. So, we multiply that figure by 40 to give a total of 378,421,120,000,000 km.

How many miles does light travel in a year?
-------------------------------------------

Light travels a whopping 9,460,528,000,000 km in a year, equivalent to 5,878,499,562,555 miles. Those are really large numbers! How far is 40 light-years? In February 2017, astronomers detected seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a single star 40 light-years away from Earth.

How many light years away is Mars from Earth?
---------------------------------------------

Neverthless, here is your answer: Just divide the time in seconds light takes between Earth and Mars, by the number of seconds within one year: #1333/(365.25xx24xx60xx60)=4.2xx10^(-5)#light years Answer link Related questions Is the word “universe” supposed to be capitalized as a proper noun?

How many light years away from the Earth is Betelgeuse?
-------------------------------------------------------

Betelgeuse is 643 +/- 46 light-years from Earth. Earlier measurements placed it at approx. 430 light years from Earth (because Betelgeuse is a variable red giant, it made accurate measurements difficult)
