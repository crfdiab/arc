How might the locations of Lystrosaurus fossils be seen as evidence the continents were once together?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How might the locations of Lystrosaurus fossils be seen as evidence that the continents were once together? The Lystrosauros ae spread apart all of the ocean and so the continents would have had to been together in order for them to be spread all over.

When did Lystrosaurus go extinct?

------------------------------------------------

It was probably closely related to the African Lystrosaurus curvatus, which is regarded as one of the least specialized species and has been found in very Late Permian and very Early Triassic sediments. Distribution of four Permian and Triassic fossil groups used as biogeographic evidence for continental drift, and land bridging.

How big was the Lystrosaurus during the Triassic period?
