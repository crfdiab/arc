What are the 4 food webs?
-------------------------

On the blackboard, write the following headings: Producers, Primary Consumers, Secondary Consumers, and Tertiary Consumers. Ask students to name some species under each heading. Then demonstrate how to create a food chain, using some of the species listed.

What belongs in a food web?
---------------------------

A food web consists of all the food chains in a single ecosystem. Each food chain is one possible path that energy and nutrients may take as they move through the ecosystem. All of the interconnected and overlapping food chains in an ecosystem make up a food web.

What is difference between food chain &amp; food web?
-----------------------------------------------------

A food chain follows one path of energy and materials between species. A food web is more complex and is a whole system of connected food chains. In a food web, organisms are placed into different trophic levels.

Which is an example of the food web?
------------------------------------

The savanna food web might start with a warthog eating star grass. The warthog can then be caught and eaten by the lion or wild dog. Another example would be of a termite eating the red oat grass. That termite might then be eaten by the mongoose or the serval.

How are food webs and food chains alike and different?
------------------------------------------------------

We will explore the differences here. A food chain presents a unique, connected path of energy flow in an ecosystem, whereas the food web explains how food chains overlap. Both food chains and food webs, shares three types of organisms in a food chain: producers, consumers and decomposers.

Who are the primary consumers on the food web?
----------------------------------------------

They are also called herbivores animals who eat producers or plants. Sometimes, these primary consumers become prey for other animals that sit higher on the food chain. Some of the primary consumers or herbivores living on the land are chipmunks, mice, horses, birds, deer and some insects.

Which is an example of a food chain?
------------------------------------

For example, a zebra eats grass, and the zebra is eaten by the lion. The food chain looks like this: Food chains are a simple look at how sunlight is made into energy by plants through photosynthesis, then how that energy is transferred from animal to animal after eating the plants.
