What are intense wind and rain storms that form over oceans in the tropics?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hurricanes, known generically as tropical cyclones, are low-pressure systems with organized thunderstorm activity that form over tropical or subtropical waters. They gain their energy from warm ocean waters. As storm systems strengthen into hurricanes, the surface winds move continuously in a circular motion.

What is a tropical storm called?
--------------------------------

Hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons are all types of tropical storms. Hurricanes are tropical storms that form over the North Atlantic Ocean and Northeast Pacific. Cyclones are formed over the South Pacific and Indian Ocean. Typhoons are formed over the Northwest Pacific Ocean.

What is a tropical storm that forms over the ocean?
---------------------------------------------------

Only tropical cyclones that form over the Atlantic Ocean or eastern Pacific Ocean are called “hurricanes.” Whatever they are called, tropical cyclones all form the same way. Tropical cyclones are like giant engines that use warm, moist air as fuel. That is why they form only over warm ocean waters near the equator.

What are the large and destructive storms that form over tropical waters called?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scientific name for a hurricane, regardless of its location, is tropical cyclone. In general, a cyclone is a large system of spinning air that rotates around a point of low pressure. Only tropical cyclones, which have warm air at their center, become the powerful storms that are called hurricanes.

Is a tropical storm dangerous?
------------------------------

Tropical storms vary in power and duration, but they all pose a serious safety hazard. A tropical storm is much stronger than a tropical depression, and the associated hazards are much greater. Increased rainfall can cause more widespread flooding, and powerful winds can take down larger structures.

What are the greatest storms on earth?
--------------------------------------

Hurricanes are the most powerful storms on Earth. Whether called typhoons in the western Pacific or cyclones in the Indian Ocean, damage and destruction result wherever they strike land.

Which is the most violent type of tropical cyclone?
---------------------------------------------------

Many storms of this type develop into more violent and destructive type of tropical storms. Hurricane is a severe tropical cyclone having a maximum wind speed in excess of 119 km per hour. The name ‘hurricane’ is given to the tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic and the eastern North Pacific oceans.

Why are hurricanes referred to as tropical cyclones?
----------------------------------------------------

If you live or like to vacation along the world’s coastlines, chances are good you’ve been affected by a tropical storm or hurricane. Hurricanes, which are more broadly called “tropical cyclones” because they originate over Earth’s tropical oceans, are some of nature’s largest and fiercest storms.

How are tropical storms formed in the tropics?
----------------------------------------------

These violent storms form over the ocean, often beginning as a tropical wave – a low pressure area that moves through the moisture-rich tropics, possibly enhancing shower and thunderstorm activity. As this weather system moves westward across the tropics, warm ocean air rises into the storm, forming an area of low pressure underneath.

What makes a hurricane form in the ocean?
-----------------------------------------

Warm water: Water at least 26.5 degrees Celsius over a depth of 50 meters powers the storm. Thunderstorm activity: Thunderstorms turn ocean heat into hurricane fuel. Low wind shear: A large difference in wind speed and direction around or near the storm can weaken it. Mix it all together, and you’ve got a hurricane – maybe.
