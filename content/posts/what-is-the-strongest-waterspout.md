What makes a Dirt Devil tornado?
--------------------------------

Dust devils form when hot air at the surface begins to rise rapidly with much cooler air above it and higher up into the atmosphere. The hot air then stretches and causes a spinning motion much like a tornado. They are short-lived because cold air eventually gets pulled in and dissipates the dust devil.

How is a funnel cloud different from a tornado?
-----------------------------------------------

You will still hear meteorologists and storm chasers discuss “the funnel cloud of a tornado,” since that is the visibly rotating column of the tornado, but some funnel clouds never make it to be a tornado. They begin their descent from the wall cloud and then the processes supporting them weaken.

How does a landspout form in a tornado?
---------------------------------------

A landspout requires a towering cumulus cloud to be present over a boundary of converging winds near the surface. As that cumulus cloud grows and passes over the boundary, the rotating air is stretched vertically and eventually grows into a landspout.

When do you stop calling it a funnel cloud?
-------------------------------------------

If the funnel cloud reaches the ground, however, the terminology changes. That’s when we drop the term “funnel cloud” and start to use the word “tornado” instead.

What do you call a rotating funnel cloud?
-----------------------------------------

Thus, in most cases, the term “funnel cloud” is specifically used to describe the rotating column of condensation, from the moment it begins to descend from the wall cloud, to just before it touches the ground.
