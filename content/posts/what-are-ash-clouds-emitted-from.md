What are ash clouds emitted from?
---------------------------------

In the air, magma cools and solidifies into volcanic rock and glass fragments. Eruptions can also shatter the solid rock of the magma chamber and volcanic mountain itself. These rock fragments can mix with the solidified lava fragments in the air and create an ash cloud.

Why are ash clouds hazardous?
-----------------------------

Its particles are very hard and usually have jagged edges. As a result, it can cause eye, nose, and lung irritation, as well as breathing problems. While in the air, ash can cause problems for jet engines, forcing airlines to cancel flights through the affected area.

How are ash clouds made?
------------------------

Ash clouds occur where a violent explosive eruption ejects volcanic ash into the atmosphere. Ash is composed of small shattered fragments of rock and volcanic glass particles. When gas or water vapour expands dramatically within the magma rocks are blown to pieces by the sudden expansion- an eruption.

Why is volcanic ash heavy?
--------------------------

The force of the escaping gas violently shatters solid rocks. Expanding gas also shreds magma and blasts it into the air, where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass. Once in the air, hot ash and gas rise quickly to form a towering eruption column, often more than 30,000 feet high.

What makes up an ash cloud from a volcano?
------------------------------------------

An ash cloud is a large cloud of smoke and debris that forms over a volcano after it erupts. Ash clouds consist of several elements, including ash, gases, dust, steam, rock fragments and other materials that come from inside the volcano and combine in the air above the crater. While smoke and gases from ash clouds often hover…

How does volcanic ash affect the air industry?
----------------------------------------------

Air traffic controller s take special precaution s when volcanic ash is present. The 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland, produced an ash cloud that forced the cancel ation of roughly 100,000 flights and affected 7 million passengers, costing the aviation industry an estimated $2.6 billion.

How long does it take for Ash to fall from a volcano?
-----------------------------------------------------

While smoke and gases from ash clouds often hover over a volcano for hours or days after an eruption, fragments can get blown several miles from the source. Flying debris poses a threat to populations within short distances of the eruption. It is common for ash to fall over the eruption area for several hours.

What happens to your body when you breathe in volcanic ash?
-----------------------------------------------------------

If inhale d, volcanic ash can cause breathing problems and damage the lungs. Inhaling large amounts of ash and volcanic gases can cause a person to suffocate. Suffocation is the most common cause of death from a volcano.
