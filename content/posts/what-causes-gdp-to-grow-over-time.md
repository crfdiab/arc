What causes GDP to grow over time?
----------------------------------

Economic growth means an increase in real GDP. Economic growth is caused by two main factors: An increase in aggregate demand (AD) An increase in aggregate supply (productive capacity)

What are 3 ways GDP can be increased?
-------------------------------------

We can use one of our key macroeconomic measures, gross domestic product (GDP), to figure this out. GDP can be measured in three different ways: the value added approach, the income approach (how much is earned as income on resources used to make stuff), and the expenditures approach (how much is spent on stuff).

What does it mean if a country’s GDP is growing?
------------------------------------------------

Rising GDP means the economy is growing, and the resources available to people in the country – goods and services, wages and profits – are increasing.

What are the two things that can cause GDP to increase?
-------------------------------------------------------

Real increases in GDP occur when the economy produces: more or better goods and services. How does real GDP isolate the impact of changes in output on GDP?

What is the best way to increase GDP?
-------------------------------------

To increase economic growth

1. Lower interest rates – reduce the cost of borrowing and increase consumer spending and investment.
2. Increased real wages – if nominal wages grow above inflation then consumers have more disposable to spend.
3. Higher global growth – leading to increased export spending.

What can replace GDP?
---------------------

The HDI is a prime alternative to the GDP system, factoring in life expectancy, education length and quality, and standards of living. Another alternative is the GPI system, which factors in ecology to measure a country’s total value.

How is economic growth related to real GDP?
-------------------------------------------

Economic growth is the increase in real (after inflation) GDP, where GDP is the total value of the domestic production of all goods and services. The key word here is value. Economic growth occurs when the value of real GDP increases. There are two ways in which value can be affected.

Is it easy to increase your country’s GDP?
------------------------------------------

Usually but not universally this produces a significant increase in GDP, with many beneficial effects. This method is also relatively easy (no rocket science involved), and cheap (and can easily pay for itself in reduced debt servicing charges). Furthermore, unlike actually producing more goods and services, it doesn’t contribute to global warming.

How is the GDP of a country calculated?
---------------------------------------

The Gross Domestic Product of a country can be defined as the total monetary value of the goods and services produced within its borders in a year. GDP growth is expressed as a percent. The average growth rate has been calculated using the geometric mean to obtain a 10-year equivalent rate.

Is it better to have a high or low GDP growth rate?
---------------------------------------------------

Many politicians think more growth is always better. But a healthy GDP growth rate is like a body temperature of 98.6 degrees. If your temperature is lower than the ideal, you know you’re sick.
