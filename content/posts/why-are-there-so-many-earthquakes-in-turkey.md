Turkey, one of the most earthquake-vulnerable parts of the seismically circum-Mediterranean region.

Why is Istanbul more prone to earthquakes?

The country is among the world’s most seismically active zones as it is situated on several active fault lines, with the most potentially devastating being the Northern Anatolia Fault (NAF), the meeting point of the Anatolian and Eurasian tectonic plates.

How many people die in the earthquake in Turkey?

The death toll from Friday’s earthquake in the Aegean Sea has reached 100, with the deaths of 98 people in Turkey’s western city of Izmir, disaster authorities said. Two teenagers also died on the Greek island of Samos, authorities said. It was the deadliest quake to hit Turkey in nearly a decade.

Where are the earthquake fault lines in Turkey?
-----------------------------------------------

Turkey is a seismically active area within the complex zone of collision between the Eurasian Plate and both the African and Arabian Plates.

Why is Turkey such a hot spot for earthquakes?

---------------------------------------------

The Oct. 23 quake struck in the afternoon, about 9 miles (16 kilometers) north-northeast of the city of Van. The quake ruptured 12.4 miles (20 km) underground. In Eastern Turkey, the Arabian Plate — a huge slab of the Earth’s crust — is slowly smashing into the Eurasian Plate at a speed of less than 1 inch per year (24 millimeters per year).
