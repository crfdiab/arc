Why is it important to have an amendment process in the Constitution?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Framers added a process for amending, or changing, the Constitution in Article V. Since 1789, the United States has added 27 amendments to the Constitution. These first amendments were designed to protect individual rights and liberties, like the right to free speech and the right to trial by jury.

What is Constitutional Amendment and why is it important?
---------------------------------------------------------

The Constitution makers felt that it has to be in accordance with people’s aspirations and changes in society. They did not see it as a sacred, static and unalterable law. So, they made provisions to incorporate changes from time to time. These changes are called constitutional amendments.

What is the most important amendment in the constitution?
---------------------------------------------------------

Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. The 13th Amendment is perhaps the most important amendment in American history. Ratified in 1865, it was the first of three “Reconstruction amendments” that were adopted immediately following the Civil War.

Why are the amendments to the Constitution important?
-----------------------------------------------------

The Amendments to the Constitution are important because they outline the freedoms given to the American people. Some amendments include the right to keep and bear arms and the right to free speech. The First Amendment gives the American people the right to free speech, religion, press and assembly.

Is there a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution?
----------------------------------------------------------------

A convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, also called an Article V Convention or amendatory convention, called for by two-thirds (currently 34) of the state legislatures, is one of two processes authorized by Article Five of the United States Constitution whereby the United States Constitution may be altered.

Why was a convention necessary to make the Constitution?
--------------------------------------------------------

I doubt . . . whether any Convention we can obtain, maybe able to make a better constitution; for, when you assemble a number of men, to have the ad­vantage of their joint wisdom, you inevitably assemble with those men all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests, and their selfish views.

Why was the Bill of Rights proposed at the convention?
------------------------------------------------------

The Bill of Rights, which includes the first ten amendments, as well as the Twenty-seventh Amendment, were proposed in part because of a Convention application by the New York and Virginia legislatures at the suggestion of a letter from the New York State Convention to ratify the Constitution.
