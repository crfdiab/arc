Is the deep ocean saltwater or freshwater?
------------------------------------------

Deep ocean water (DOW) is the name for cold, salty water found deep below the surface of Earth’s oceans.

Is the Indian Ocean saltwater or freshwater?
--------------------------------------------

Indian Ocean, body of salt water covering approximately one-fifth of the total ocean area of the world. It is the smallest, geologically youngest, and physically most complex of the world’s three major oceans (Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian).

Is the Southern Ocean salt water?
---------------------------------

As Sea Ice Around Antarctica Melts, The Southern Ocean Is Becoming Fresher. When this saltless sea ice melts back into the ocean and into warmer northern seas, it freshens the saltwater around it, reducing its salinity.

Is the Atlantic Ocean fresh water?
----------------------------------

If you dive deep enough off America’s northeast coast you’ll find something surprising under the Atlantic Ocean: freshwater. A gigantic aquifer of mostly freshwater, hugging the coastline from New Jersey up to Massachusetts, sits below the ocean floor. It’s the biggest known undersea, freshwater aquifer on Earth.

Is it healthy to drink ocean water?
-----------------------------------

Drinking seawater can be deadly to humans. Seawater contains salt. When humans drink seawater, their cells are thus taking in water and salt. While humans can safely ingest small amounts of salt, the salt content in seawater is much higher than what can be processed by the human body.

Does the sea get less salty?
----------------------------

But the salt content is on the decline, a sign of potentially worrisome consequences that scientists can’t accurately predict. Since the late 1960s, much of the North Atlantic Ocean has become less salty, in part due to increases in fresh water runoff induced by global warming, scientists say.

Which is more dense salt water or freshwater?
---------------------------------------------

Saltwater is denser than freshwater due to the sodium chloride dissolved in it. This means that a specific volume of salt water is heaver than the same volume of freshwater. Warmer salt water is less dense than colder saltwater, which results in the colder water sinking to the ocean floor.

Why are lakes freshwater and oceans salt water?
-----------------------------------------------

Jason0421-YYCA. Lake water is called freshwater because Rain falls as fresh water and ocean water is called salt water because after the rain falls it goes down hill collecting minerals and salt and finally goes into the ocean causing “salt water” and when it rains this cycle happens all over again.

Which is the ocean with the most salt?
--------------------------------------

Located between Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east, the Pacific Ocean has the most salt because parts experience excess evaporation, which leaves the water more dense and salty. The oceans are salty, which makes them unsuitable for drinking.

Is the Gulf of Mexico fresh or salt water?
------------------------------------------

The amount of nutrients it discharges into the Gulf of Mexico is correspondingly large. Because freshwater from the river is lighter than the salty seawater, it settles as a distinct layer above the seawater. Similarly, you may ask, is the Gulf of Mexico fresh or salt water?
