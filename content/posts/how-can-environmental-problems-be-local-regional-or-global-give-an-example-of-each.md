How can environmental problems be local regional or global give an example of each?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental problems can occur on different scales: local, regional, or global. A local example would be your community discussing where to build a new landfill. A regional example would be a polluted river 1000 miles away affecting the region’s water. A global example would be the depletion of the ozone layer.

How environmental problems can Belocal regional or global?
----------------------------------------------------------

What are the local and global environmental issues problems?
------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Key Global Environmental Problems

- 1 Global Warming.
- 2 Ozone Depletion and Destruction.
- 3 Sharp Decrease of Forest Cover.
- 4 Declining of Biological Diversity.
- 5 Acid Rain Pollution.
- 6 Land Desertification.
- 7 Marine Pollution and Damage.
- 8 Water Pollution and Freshwater Resource Shortage.

What makes an environmental problem global?
-------------------------------------------

Various processes that can be said to contribute to the global environmental problems include pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain, depletion of natural resources, overpopulation, waste disposal, deforestation and loss of biodiversity. These processes have highly negative impact on our environment.

What is an example of a regional environmental problem?
-------------------------------------------------------

Intensifying human activities such as burning fossil fuels, extensive deforestation and land use change, and waste production create environmental pressures and drive regional and global change.

What is a regional environmental problem?
-----------------------------------------

A regional environmental problem can be depicted as international river. Such as Asi (Orontes) river. But due to heavy irrigation in Syria, water quantity drops when this river reaches Turkey. Water quality also decreases in its way. Finally, a global environmental problem is greenhouse effect.

What are local, regional and global environmental issues?
---------------------------------------------------------

Transcript of Local, Regional &amp; Global Environmental issues. The region’s construction industry is considered to be a major cause of air pollution due to the dust and particle emissions from factories catering to the sector. Regional and Global environmental issues (cont.) -Household dumping and littering.

What are some of the major environmental problems in the world?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Global Environmental Problem • Global Warming • Water Pollution • Air Pollution 3. Global Warming 4. Cause – Global warming is primarily a problem of too much carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere—which acts as a blanket, trapping heat and warming the planet.

How are environmental issues related to human activity?
-------------------------------------------------------

Environmental issues are harmful effects of human activity on the biophysical environment. They relate to the anthropogenic effects on the natural environment, which are loosely divided into causes, effects and mitigation, noting that effects are interconnected and can cause new effects. 1.

Which is the best way to study environmental issues?
----------------------------------------------------

There are two ways of studying environmental problems Firstly, to look for adverse effects by not looking at the origin of is occurrence. Secondly to understand cause and effect relationship in order to predict better and make possible efforts to reduce or vanish its adverse effects.
