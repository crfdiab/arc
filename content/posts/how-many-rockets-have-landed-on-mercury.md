How many rockets have landed on Mercury?
----------------------------------------

Two spacecraft have visited the planet Mercury so far. The first was called Mariner 10. During 1974 and 1975, Mariner 10 flew by Mercury three times and mapped about half of the planet’s surface.

What probes have been sent to Mercury?
--------------------------------------

Only two probes have ever traveled to the planet. The first was Mariner 10, a spacecraft meant to study both Venus and Mercury. It flew by Mercury three times in 1974 and 1975. Then, in 2004, NASA launched the MESSENGER spacecraft, which successfully inserted itself into Mercury’s orbit in 2011.

What was the name of the rocket used in the Mercury missions?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The first two of the six flights with an astronaut on board used a Redstone rocket. The four manned flights that orbited Earth used an Atlas rocket. Both of these rockets were originally designed as missiles for the United States military. The project was named Mercury after a Roman god who was very fast.

What are the names of the two spacecrafts that were sent to Mercury?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

NASA – MESSENGER: The Extreme Machine. Only one NASA spacecraft has visited Mercury and that was Mariner 10 in 1974 and 1975. It was programmed to fly by the planet three times to take images of its heavily-cratered surface.

What happened Apollo 5?
-----------------------

Apollo 5 (January 22, 1968, also known as AS-204), was the first uncrewed flight of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), which would later carry astronauts to the lunar surface. It lifted off with a Saturn IB rocket on an Earth-orbital flight.

What was the name of the first spacecraft to visit Mercury?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The first was called Mariner 10. During 1974 and 1975, Mariner 10 flew by Mercury three times and mapped about half of the planet’s surface. Mariner 10 also discovered Mercury’s thin atmosphere and detected its magnetic field.

What was the name of the rocket that failed to orbit the Moon?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Failed to orbit; premature first stage cutoff. Reached apogee of 102,360 kilometres (63,600 mi). Carrier rocket guidance problem resulted in failure to impact Moon, flew past in a heliocentric orbit, later known as Luna 1. Closest approach 5,995 kilometres (3,725 mi) on 4 January.

What was the name of the spacecraft that carried three astronauts to the Moon?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the actual capsule that carried three astronauts to the moon and back in July 1969. The interior of the Apollo 11 Command Module, Columbia, which served as living quarters for the astronauts throughout the journey. This is the hatch from the Apollo 11 Command Module.

What was the name of the German rocket that went into space?
------------------------------------------------------------

Working for the U.S. Army at the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, the German rocket engineers were led by Wernher von Braun and had developed the German V2 rocket into a more powerful rocket, called the Jupiter C, or Juno. Explorer carried several instruments into space for conducting science experiments.
