Which planet is less than half the diameter of the Earth and looks like our own moon?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Horizons showed that Pluto has a diameter of 1,473 miles (2,370 km), less than one-fifth the diameter of Earth, and only about two-thirds as wide as Earth’s moon.

Which planet looks like our moon?
---------------------------------

planet Mercury  
The planet Mercury looks a little bit like Earth’s moon. Like our Moon, Mercury’s surface is covered with craters caused by space rock impacts. Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and the eighth largest. It has a diameter of 4,880 kilometers.

What planet has the smallest diameter?
--------------------------------------

Mercury  
With a diameter of 4,879 km (3031.67 mi), Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System.

Which planet is the smallest almost half the size of Earth?
-----------------------------------------------------------

| Size of Planet Mars. Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, is the second smallest planet in the solar system; only Mercury is smaller. Mars is about half (53 percent) the size of Earth, but because Mars is a desert planet, it has the same amount of dry land as Earth.

Is there a planet bigger than the Sun?
--------------------------------------

The Sun is ten times the diameter of Jupiter, and it turns out you can’t get planets much bigger than Jupiter. If you add mass to them, they get smaller, not bigger. So clearly you can’t get a planet bigger than the Sun. Both are smaller than Jupiter, and EBLM J0555-57Ab is only about the size of Saturn!

Which is the smallest planet in our Solar System?
-------------------------------------------------

With a diameter of 4,879 km (3031.67 mi), Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System. In fact, Mercury is not much larger than Earth’s own Moon – which has a diameter of 3,474 km (2158.64 mi).

What’s the name of the planet that looks like Earth?
----------------------------------------------------

Kepler-452b resides 1,400 light-years from Earth. Despite our planet’s name, about 70 percent of its surface is covered with water. Earth orbits a middle-age star called the sun, which is about 4.5 billion years old and is expected to put out a consistent amount of energy for several billion years more.

How big is the Moon compared to the Earth?
------------------------------------------

The moon has a diameter of 2,160 miles with a surface area of 14,658,000 square miles, and it will require 81 moons for them to fit into the earth. Is the Moon a Planet or a Star?

How big is the Earth compared to the other planets?
---------------------------------------------------

This means that it varies in diameter from 108,728 km (67560.447 mi) when measured at the poles and 120,536 km (74,897.6 mi) when measured at the equator. This is a difference of almost 12,000 km, the greatest of all planets.
