What is a natural flow of water to the surface where the surface dips below the water table?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A spring is a natural flow of groundwater to Earth’s surface in places where the ground surface dips below the water table. Wells and springs are classified into two groups—ordinary and artesian.

Which characteristics do most areas with karst topography share?
----------------------------------------------------------------

This produces depressions called sinkholes, which are among the most characteristic features of karst topography. Sinkholes commonly coalesce into much larger depressions called poljen, which are often flat-floored and covered with soil that is derived from the insoluble residues of the limestone.

When precipitation soaks into the cracks and pores beneath the Earth’s surface it is called?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

percolation. the process by which water seeping downward through cracks and pores in soil or rock. gravitational water. water that is not held by capillary action in soil, but that percolates downward by the force of gravity. groundwater.

What happens if a cave collapses?
---------------------------------

As the groundwater dissolves limestone, it creates voids and removes the rock that supports the surface. At the ground surface, sinkholes form where the ground has subsided underneath Some valleys have no “exit” where a stream leads to a river.

What is the term for a well where water freely flows to the surface?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Artesian Well. Well through which water flows freely without being pumped. Artesian Springs. form naturally when cracks occur in the caprock – water from the aquifer flows through the cracks.

What are natural structures hanging from a caves ceiling?
---------------------------------------------------------

A stalactite is an icicle-shaped formation that hangs from the ceiling of a cave and is produced by precipitation of minerals from water dripping through the cave ceiling. Most stalactites have pointed tips.

What are the stages of hydrological cycle?
------------------------------------------

There are four main stages in the water cycle. They are evaporation, condensation, precipitation and collection.
