Can a supernova destroy Earth?
------------------------------

A supernova is a star explosion – destructive on a scale almost beyond human imagining. If our sun exploded as a supernova, the resulting shock wave probably wouldn’t destroy the whole Earth, but the side of Earth facing the sun would boil away. Clearly, the sun’s distance – 8 light-minutes away – isn’t safe.

What would happen if a supernova happened on Earth?
---------------------------------------------------

The entire Earth could be vaporized in just a fraction of a second if the supernova was close enough. The shockwave would arrive with enough force to wipe out our entire atmosphere and even our oceans. The exploded star would grow brighter for about three weeks after the explosion, casting shadows even during the day.

Can we survive a supernova?
---------------------------

In the current presentation we analyze, based on known physics, the effect of a supernova explosion on a planet orbiting such a star in its habitable zone. In some cases even a portion of a planetary biosphere (deep in planet’s crust) can survive. However, if a star loses too much mass, a planet would leave.

Is there going to be a supernova in 2020?
-----------------------------------------

A bright red supergiant star in our galaxy that’s near the end of its life, Betelgeuse likely will explode as a supernova and be visible in the daytime sometime in the next 100,000 years, but its recent episode of dimming—which saw it lose two-thirds of its brilliance by February 2020—appears to have just been … dust.

Is the Earth in danger of being destroyed by a supernova?
---------------------------------------------------------

But, since Earth is currently not near any star that’s in danger of going supernova soon, the planet will most likely not get completely destroyed if it gets hit by a distant GRB. According to retired engineer Duncan Caincross from New Zealand, a GRB from a faraway supernova could destroy half of the Earth’s ozone layer.

How long would it take for a supernova to hit Earth?
----------------------------------------------------

The only star if it went supernova that would affect Earth is the sun, And we would have exactly 8 minutes before it consumes us. The other ‘nearby’ stars are over 4 light years way. meaning that even the light from them in the event of a supernova would take over 4 years before we could see it.

Is it possible for the sun to become a supernova?
-------------------------------------------------

In order for a star to go supernova, it has to have a mass greater than at least 8 solar masses. Although there is some debate about the exact threshold, the Sun is not nearly massive enough, not even close. So if it went supernova it would be really weird.

When was the last time there was a supernova?
---------------------------------------------

One way to evaluate the risk is to look at the consequences of past nearby supernovas. It’s not easy to find evidence of them, which is one strong indication that only the very closest supernovas present much of a risk. A recent study claims to find chemical evidence of two supernova explosions between 1.7 million and 3.2 million years ago.
