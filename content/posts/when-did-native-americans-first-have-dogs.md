When did Native Americans first have dogs?
------------------------------------------

Origins. The Earliest evidence for dogs in the Americas can be found in Danger Cave, Utah, a site dated between 9,000 and 10,000 years BP (Before Present) Dogs descended from Eurasian Grey Wolves.

The only domesticated species in the Americas were the dog, turkey, guinea pig and two Andean camelids \[1\] .

What was the first dog in America?
----------------------------------

The earliest probable dog remains found in North America are about 8700 to 14 000 years old. These dogs were medium-sized and likely used in hunting. Dogs of this time-period and region are not very common. 8700 to 9300 year-old remains were found in Wyoming, U.S.A., at the Horner site.

Did American Indians domesticate wolves?
