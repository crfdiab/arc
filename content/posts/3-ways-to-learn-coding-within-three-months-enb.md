If you desire to code but have no plan on how to get started then this article is for you. Desiring to code is one thing and being consistent about it is another thing. Most [beginners](https://www.anythingprogramming.com/?m=1) give up when things start to go south. Welcome to anythingprogramming.com, in this article I will list some guides that will help you to stay on track without burning out.

**Why Do You Desire To Code?**

The answer to this question might be challenging to figure out. Some see coding as nothing other than sitting in front of your computer to code others derive their passion from others.

Deriving passion from people isn’t bad but the question you have to ask yourself is can I hold on to this passion for long? Do I even understand this passion?

** Are Three months enough to Get Started?**

With consistency and plan, three months will be too much. If you dedicate an hour a day to study continuously without any interruption you will be able to build basic systems or applications.

The most difficult aspect is to get started. You will not be good at coding overnight but with a little bit of dedication and discipline, you will be doing well by watching tutorials videos, reading extensively and noting points.

**Ways To Learn To Code Within Three Months**

  ** 1. Read Books**

There are millions of coding books out there to support you in your [coding](https://www.anythingprogramming.com/?m=1) journey. Note, reading these books will not make you a good programmer but if you practice what is written in the book over time, you will be doing well.

  2  **Sign-Up For Bootcamp**
There are [alternatives](https://www.anythingprogramming.com/?m=1) to this by pursuing a computer science degree. Sign-up to boot camp helps you to be in alignment whiles you make friends with people who have the same interest as you do. Bootcamp shortens the learning curves by giving you the right information which is needed to get started.

3. **Get Mentor**

A mentor is someone who will hold your hands and help you when you are need it. Mentors’ advice helps you think broadly, they also make you aware of what you might be facing in the industry.
