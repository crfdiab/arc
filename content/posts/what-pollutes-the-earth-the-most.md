What pollutes the earth the most?
---------------------------------

There are five main types of pollution troubling our planet: air, water, soil, light, and noise. Whilst all of these are undeniably harmful to us, air pollution and water pollution pose the biggest threat. In 2017, air pollution contributed close to five million deaths globally – that’s nearly one in every 10 deaths.

What causes most of Earth’s pollution?
--------------------------------------

“Most air pollution comes from energy use and production,” says John Walke, director of the Clean Air Project, part of the Climate and Clean Energy program at NRDC. “Air pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and methane raises the earth’s temperature,” Walke says.

What makes up the most of the earth’s pollution?
------------------------------------------------

What pollutes the earth the most? The top 10, in alphabetical order, are: artisanal gold mining; contaminated surface water; contaminated groundwater; indoor air pollution; metals smelting and processing; industrial mining; radioactive waste and uranium mining; untreated sewage; urban air quality; and used lead–acid battery recycling.

How is the atmosphere polluted by human activity?
-------------------------------------------------

Accordingly, how polluted is our Earth? Air pollution is damaging not only to human health, but to other species and ecosystems as well. Our atmosphere is a protective layer of gases surrounding Earth. It can be polluted by natural sources, like when a volcano erupts and spews gases into the air. But human activity also pollutes the atmosphere.

What kind of pollution is harmful to the environment?
-----------------------------------------------------

Land pollution. Hazardous waste is any liquid, solid or sludge waste that contain properties that are dangerous of potentially harmful to human health or the environment. Industries generate hazardous waste from mining, petroleum refining, pesticide manufacturing and other chemical production.

How is plastic pollution affecting the world’s environment?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental issues, as rapidly increasing production of disposable plastic products overwhelms the world’s ability to deal with them. Plastic pollution is most visible in developing Asian and African nations, where garbage collection systems are often inefficient or nonexistent.
