When did the Yellowstone volcano last erupt?
--------------------------------------------

approximately 630,000 years ago

Did Yellowstone erupt in the past?
----------------------------------

The last time the Yellowstone supervolcano erupted was 640,000+ years ago. The Yellowstone eruption area collapsed upon itself, creating a sunken giant crater or caldera 1,500 square miles in area.

What would happen if Yellowstone erupted right now?
---------------------------------------------------

If the supervolcano underneath Yellowstone National Park ever had another massive eruption, it could spew ash for thousands of miles across the United States, damaging buildings, smothering crops, and shutting down power plants. It’d be a huge disaster.

How long has it been since a volcano erupted in Yellowstone?
------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Within the past two million years, some volcanic eruptions have occurred in the Yellowstone area—three of them super eruptions. The Yellowstone caldera was created by a massive volcanic eruption approximately 640,000 years ago. Later lava flows filled in much of the caldera, now it is 30 x 45 miles.

Is it possible for Yellowstone Caldera to erupt again?
------------------------------------------------------

The rhyolite magma chamber beneath Yellowstone is only 5-15% molten (the rest is solidified but still hot), so it is unclear if there is even enough magma beneath the caldera to feed an eruption. If Yellowstone does erupt again, it need not be a large eruption.

Are there any volcanoes in the Yellowstone hotspot?
---------------------------------------------------

Many eruptive units found along the path of the Yellowstone hotspot have been dated, but only a few of them represent large caldera-forming eruptions. At least five volcanic fields centered on large caldera complexes have been identified.

How did the Yellowstone Supervolcano get its heat?
--------------------------------------------------

Yellowstone Supervolcano Revealed. These features exist because of the high heat discharge from the molten rock that fuels the volcanic eruptions. Heat is conducted from the molten rock—found four to five miles beneath the surface of the park—upward to the groundwater system, creating spouting geysers and bubbling hot springs.
