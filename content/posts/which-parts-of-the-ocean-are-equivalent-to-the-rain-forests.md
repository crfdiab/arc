Which parts of the ocean are equivalent to the rain forests?
------------------------------------------------------------

Coral reefs are often called the “tropical rainforests of the sea” for their astounding richness of life. Due to their structural complexity, corals are one of the most productive ecosystems on Earth, providing important services to mankind including fisheries, coastal protection, medicines, recreation, and tourism.

Why do the forest floor appear dark in the rainforest?
------------------------------------------------------

The rainforest floor is often dark and humid due to constant shade from the canopy’s leaves. Despite its constant shade, the rainforest floor is an important part of the forest ecosystem. The forest floor is where decomposition takes place.

What percentage of light reaches the forest floor in a tropical rainforest?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earth Floor: Biomes. Although tropical rainforests receive 12 hours of sunlight daily, less than 2% of that sunlight ever reaches the ground.

Are rainforests and tropical forests the same?
----------------------------------------------

There are two types of rainforests, tropical and temperate. Tropical rainforests are found closer to the equator where it is warm. Temperate rainforests are found near the cooler coastal areas further north or south of the equator. The tropical rainforest is a hot, moist biome where it rains all year long.

What is special about a forest floor?
-------------------------------------

The forest floor, also called detritus, duff and the O horizon, is one of the most distinctive features of a forest ecosystem. The forest floor serves as a bridge between the above ground living vegetation and the soil, and it is a crucial component in nutrient transfer through the biogeochemical cycle.

Why is the forest floor the darkest part of the rainforest?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Forest Floor Layer. The forest floor is the darkest of all rainforest layers, making it extremely difficult for plants to grow. Leaves that fall to the forest floor decay quickly. Decomposers, such as termites, slugs, scorpions, worms, and fungi, thrive on the forest floor.

Which is more complex tropical rain forest or tropical reef?
------------------------------------------------------------

“… the most complex ecosystem on Earth the tropical rain forest is one thousand times more biologically complex than the tropical reef system, the second most complex system on Earth, with one million times greater biodiversity than our own ecosystem here.” – Mike Robinson, Director of the U.S. National Zoo In this lesson, we will learn:

How are tropical rain forests different from temperate forests?
---------------------------------------------------------------

If one measures the photosynthesis, or captures the litterfall of leaves, branches, fruit and other plant parts to the forest floor, one finds the production of tropical evergreen forests to be roughly double that of temperate forests. It would be natural to infer that tropical soils are very fertile in order to support this high productivity.

How are the four layers of a rainforest different?

The rainforests of the world are formed of four layers that receive different amounts of rain, wind, and sun, and as such, are home to different species. There are rainforests on all continents except Antarctica.
