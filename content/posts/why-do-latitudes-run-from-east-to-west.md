Why do latitudes run from east to west?
---------------------------------------

Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run east–west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth.

Why is latitude north and south?
--------------------------------

Equator. The equator divides the earth into the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere is marks the location of 0 degrees latitude. Latitude represents an angular distance north or south of the equator. The equator marks the locations on earth that are equidistance from the North and South Poles.

Can latitude be east to west?
-----------------------------

Lines of latitude run East-West, while lines of longitude run North-South.

Do latitude lines run east to west but measure north and south?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Hemisphere – one half of the planet Page 4 Latitude – horizontal lines on a map that run east and west. They measure north and south of the equator. Longitude – the vertical lines on a map that run north and south. They measure east and west of the Prime Meridian. It is at 0 degrees longitude.

How does latitude run north to South or east to West?
-----------------------------------------------------

Latitude is East to WestLongitude is North to SouthThe parallels lines of latitude measure the distances that run north and south. How do you remember difference between latitude and longitude? Longitude is east to west and latitude is north to Do you of latitude go from north to south or from east to west? north to south. Latitude runs which way?

How are latitude and longitude related to each other?
-----------------------------------------------------

In contemporary terms, latitude is your location north or south of the equator and longitude is your location east or west of the prime meridian, 0 degrees. Both are imaginary lines circling the earth and on a modern chart they establish a grid of lines at right angles to each other that enable you to locate your position.

Why is latitide measured in East and West?
------------------------------------------

You have just answered your own question. It is measured east and west because it runs North and South. Likewise latitide is measured North and South because it runs East and West.

What do the lines of latitude tell you?
---------------------------------------

Lines of latitude run east and west. Lines of latitude run horizontally around the Earth and tell you how far north or south you are from the Equator. Image: NASA, public domain. To remember, think of the rungs of a ladder (which sounds somewhat similar to latitude) which run across, connecting the two longer pieces.
