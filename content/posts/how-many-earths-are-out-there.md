How many Earths are out there?
------------------------------

A recent study estimates there may be up to 6 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy. “This is the science result we’ve all been waiting for,” co-author Natalie M. Batalha, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told ‘National Geographic’.

Are there planets in other galaxies?
------------------------------------

Other Solar Systems Our Milky Way Galaxy is just one of billions of galaxies in the universe. Within it, there are at least 100 billion stars, and on average, each star has at least one planet orbiting it. This means there are potentially thousands of planetary systems like our solar system within the galaxy!

How many Earth are there in galaxy?
-----------------------------------

As many as six billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy, according to new estimates. Summary: There may be as many as one Earth-like planet for every five Sun-like stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, according to new estimates.

Is there a new Earth in space?
------------------------------

Researchers have discovered a new Earth-sized planet. It’s orbiting a dim red star some 185 light-years away. The planet’s official name is K2-315b. But its nickname is “Pi Earth.” The reason: It orbits its star every 3.14 days.

Can a planet exist outside a galaxy?
------------------------------------

An extragalactic planet, also known as an extragalactic exoplanet, is a star-bound planet or rogue planet located outside of the Milky Way Galaxy. Due to the huge distances to such worlds, they would be very hard to detect directly. However, indirect evidence suggests that such planets exist.

Who found Pi earth?
-------------------

The Egyptians calculated the area of a circle by a formula that gave the approximate value of 3.1605 for π. The first calculation of π was done by Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BC), one of the greatest mathematicians of the ancient world.

Is there another Earth out there in the universe?
-------------------------------------------------

It might turn out that every star has an Earth or a Venus or a Mercury or a Mars — a smallish planet heretofore undetectable. That’s the great part about SIM — we don’t know the answer ahead of time. We don’t know if we’ll find three planets or hundreds.

Are there any other planets like the Earth?
-------------------------------------------

The discovery of a super-Earth-sized planet orbiting a sun-like star brings us closer than ever to finding a twin of our own watery world. But NASA’s Kepler space telescope has captured evidence of other potentially habitable planets amid the sea of stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

Is there such a thing as a second Earth?
----------------------------------------

“This intriguing, distant world gives us even greater hope that a second Earth lies among the stars, waiting to be found,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s science mission directorate in Washington, D.C.

How are exoplanets similar to Earth according to NASA?
------------------------------------------------------

What’s exciting is that out of all the 2,000 plus exoplanets that have been discovered using observations from the Kepler Space Telescope, this world is most similar to Earth both in size and estimated temperature, NASA said. An exoplanet is a planet that’s outside of our solar system.
