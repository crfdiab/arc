What influences life in an ecosystem?
-------------------------------------

Biotic factors include plants, animals, and other organisms. Abiotic factors include rocks, temperature, and humidity. Every factor in an ecosystem depends on every other factor, either directly or indirectly. A change in the temperature of an ecosystem will often affect what plants will grow there, for instance.

What drives diversity in an ecosystem?
--------------------------------------

Broadly speaking, the diversity of an ecosystem is dependent on the physical characteristics of the environment, the diversity of species present, and the interactions that the species have with each other and with the environment.

What does every ecosystem on earth depend on?
---------------------------------------------

The Web of Life. An ecosystem is made up of all the living animals and plants and the non-living matter in a particular place, like a forest or lake. All the living things in an ecosystem depend on all the other things – living and non-living for continued survival – for food supplies and other needs.

What is an example of diverse ecosystem?
----------------------------------------

Grasslands, tundras, deserts, rainforests, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, are some examples of ecosystems that are diverse and contribute a lot to creating a well-balanced environment.

How does life take place in an ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------

Life requires the interaction of several species in an environment that includes air and/or water to transport materials and energy. This is one of the fundamental principles of ecology; sustained life is a property of ecosystems, not organisms or species. A forest is a common ecosystem.

How are living organisms connected to the environment?
------------------------------------------------------

An ecosystem consists of a community of living organisms and their local physical environment. The living and non-living elements of an ecosystem are connected through flows of energy and the cycling of chemical elements. In this context, no part of the biosphere that is smaller than an ecosystem can sustain life.

How are living things affected by an ecosystem?
-----------------------------------------------

Living things depend upon an ecosystem for food, air, and water, as well as other things they need for survival. In turn, living things have an impact on the ecosystem in which they live. Plants, as a biotic factor in land ecosystems, affect other biotic and abiotic parts of ecosystems.

Why do we need a life on land?
------------------------------

A flourishing life on land is the foundation for our life on this planet. We are all part of the planet’s ecosystem and we have caused severe damage to it through deforestation, loss of natural habitats and land degradation. Promoting a sustainable use of our ecosystems and preserving biodiversity is not a cause.
