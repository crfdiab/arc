What is a break in the crust along which movement in an earthquake has occurred?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A fault is a break in the Earth’s crust along which blocks of the crust slide relative to one another.

Is a break in the lithosphere along which movement has occurred?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Slide 1. An earthquake is a shaking of the ground caused by the sudden movement of large blocks of rock along a fault. Earthquakes occur along faults. A fault is a fracture, or break, in Earth’s lithosphere, along which blocks of rock move past each other.

Is a crack where the movement has occurred?
-------------------------------------------

A fault is a crack in rock or soil where movement has taken place.

What is a fracture in the earth where movement has occurred?
------------------------------------------------------------

A fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock. Faults allow the blocks to move relative to each other. This movement may occur rapidly, in the form of an earthquake – or may occur slowly, in the form of creep. Faults may range in length from a few millimeters to thousands of kilometers.

What is it called when two tectonic plates meet?
------------------------------------------------

When two tectonic plates meet, we get a “plate boundary.” There are three major types of plate boundaries, each associated with the formation of a variety of geologic features. If two tectonic plates collide, they form a convergent plate boundary.

What kind of fault has no movement along it?
--------------------------------------------

any break in earth’s Lithosphere along which (movement) has occurred (regardless of size!!). Joint A break in the Lithosphere but no motion has occurred along it. What are the 2 basic types of faults that occur in nature Dip-slip , strike-slip Dip-slip fault Motion along fault is largely vertical (up-down). Strike-slip fault

How are rock folds related to plate collisions?
-----------------------------------------------

Folds 1 During plate collisions, stress can cause rock layers along continental margins to crumple… 2 Folds are described as being anticline and syncline. 3 Anticline: is an upfold in the rock layers, a syncline is a downfold in the rock layer. 4 The two sides of a fold are called limbs – limbs represent the intensity of the folding.

What do you call a break in the Earth’s lithosphere?
----------------------------------------------------

Terms in this set (74) A break in Earth’s lithosphere along which movement has occurred is known as a Fault A break in Earth’s lithosphere, but no movement has occurred is known as a Join Hot Spot Isolated Areas of volcanism, not associated with any plate boundary How do Hot spots form
