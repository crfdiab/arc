What is the amount of damage caused by an earthquake called?
------------------------------------------------------------

The effect of an earthquake on the Earth’s surface is called the intensity. The intensity scale consists of a series of certain key responses such as people awakening, movement of furniture, damage to chimneys, and finally–total destruction.

What damage is caused by earthquakes?
-------------------------------------

The damage caused by earthquakes is from ground shaking, ground rupture, landslides, tsunamis, and liquefaction. Earthquake damage from fires is the most important secondary effect.

How much property damage do earthquakes cause a year?
-----------------------------------------------------

Earthquakes are estimated to cost the nation $6.1 billion annually in building stock losses according to an updated report published today by FEMA. Earthquakes are estimated to cost the nation $6.1 billion annually in building stock losses according to an updated report published today by FEMA.

How is the damage caused by an earthquake measured?
---------------------------------------------------

This is a logarithmic scale. The amount of damage caused by an earthquake is measured by the Mercalli Scale. This is a measure of intensity, and changes according to which area you are measuring – damage nearer the epicentre would usually be greater than further away.

What are the secondary effects of an earthquake?
------------------------------------------------

That doesn’t bode well for any structures on the surface. Secondary effects: Earthquakes can trigger landslides, fires, floods or tsunamis. It was not the 2004 Sumatran-Andaman earthquake that caused so much damage in 2004 but the Indian Ocean tsunami it triggered.

How many people are killed in an earthquake?
--------------------------------------------

Nearly a quarter of a million people in 14 countries were killed when coastal communities were inundated by the water. Architecture: Even the strongest buildings may not survive a bad earthquake, but architecture plays a huge role in what and who survives a quake.

Which is more likely an earthquake to hit a populated area?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Location: This one is kind of obvious—an earthquake that hits in a populated area is more likely to do damage than one that hits an unpopulated area or the middle of the ocean. Magnitude: Scientists assign a number to represent the amount of seismic energy released by an earthquake.
