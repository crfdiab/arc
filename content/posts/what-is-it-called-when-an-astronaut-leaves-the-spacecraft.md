What is it called when an astronaut leaves the spacecraft?
----------------------------------------------------------

Extravehicular activity (EVA) is any activity done by an astronaut or cosmonaut outside a spacecraft beyond the Earth’s appreciable atmosphere. Its name derives from the astronaut “standing up” in the open hatch, usually to record or assist a spacewalking astronaut.

How do spacecraft move in space?
--------------------------------

The simple answer is that a rocket moves by pushing on the gas that flame out from its engines. Even though it seems impossible for a massive rocket to move by only venting gas, it’s the simple scientific truth, based on Newton’s third law of motion: for every action in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction.

How does an astronaut float in a space shuttle?
-----------------------------------------------

If 90 percent of Earth’s gravity reaches the space station, then why do astronauts float there? The answer is because they are in free fall. In a vacuum, gravity causes all objects to fall at the same rate. Since they are all falling together, the crew and objects appear to float when compared with the spacecraft.

How dangerous are EVAS?
-----------------------

An EVA is dangerous for a number of different reasons. The primary one is collision with space debris. Orbital velocity at 300 km above the Earth (typical for a space shuttle mission) is 7.7 km/s. Every space mission creates more orbiting debris, so this problem will continue to worsen (see also Kessler Syndrome).

Is space in a vacuum?
---------------------

First of all, when we say outer space (the space outside the atmosphere of planets and stars) is a “vacuum” or is “empty”, we really mean that outer space is nearly empty or almost a perfect vacuum. In reality, even the most remote spot of outer space has gas, dust, radiation, gravity, and a whole host of other things.

How is the vacuum chamber used in space?
----------------------------------------

The vacuum chamber was designed and constructed to test both nuclear and nonnuclear space hardware in a simulated space environment. Although the facility was designed for testing nuclear hardware, only non-nuclear tests have been performed throughout its history.

What kind of rocket does NASA use to send astronauts to space?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Orion spacecraft atop the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket will carry humans farther into space than they have gone before—for missions to the Moon and eventually to Mars.

What do astronauts do on the Space Station?
-------------------------------------------

Astronauts on the station conduct scientific experiments such as innovative cancer research and research on the human body and living in space. The agency’s commercial partners are beginning to transport cargo from Earth to the space station, and they will soon be launching astronauts to and from the station as well.

Can a Artemis astronaut work on the International Space Station?
----------------------------------------------------------------

During their careers, the Artemis Generation astronauts could launch on rockets and spacecraft developed for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program to live and work aboard the International Space Station.
