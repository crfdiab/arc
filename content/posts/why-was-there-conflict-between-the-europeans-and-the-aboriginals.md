Why was there conflict between the Europeans and the aboriginals?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Europeans viewed land for its agricultural potential and saw it as something to transform through toil and harvest. These different attitudes to land generated conflict. In the absence of obvious visible farming, Europeans assumed the land to be insignificant to Aboriginal Peoples and Torres Strait Islanders.

How did the Europeans affect aboriginals?
-----------------------------------------

European colonisation had a devastating impact on Aboriginal communities and cultures. Aboriginal people were subjected to a range of injustices, including mass killings or being displaced from their traditional lands and relocated on missions and reserves in the name of protection.

What was the initial impact of European settlement on Aboriginal land ownership?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

European settlement had a severe and devastating impact on Indigenous people. Their dispossession of the land, exposure to new diseases and involvement in violent conflict, resulted in the death of a vast number of the Aboriginal peoples.

How did the Europeans interact with the Aboriginals?
----------------------------------------------------

They then met with the local Aborigines, some falling pregnant with the Europeans and having children. This may have been suggested from when the British first arrived and members of the crew were surprised to see some of the Aboriginals with familiar European looks and taller than most of the others.

How did the Dutch have contact with Aboriginal Australians?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Dutch have had contact with Aboriginal Australia in both that they were related to the discovery of the land for the Europeans and also in person-to-person encounters. Although the Dutch have not made as large an impact as the British in the settlement of the newly found land, they have impacted Aboriginal Australia in multiple ways.

How many attacks did the Aboriginals have on the Europeans?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Over the first two decades of settlement Aboriginal people launched at least 57 attacks on white settlers, punctuating a general calm, but by 1820 the violence was becoming markedly more frequent, with one Russian explorer reporting that year that “the natives of Tasmania live in a state of perpetual hostility against the Europeans”.

How many Aborigines were there at first contact with Australia?
---------------------------------------------------------------

At first contact, there were over 250,000 aborigines in Australia. The massacres ended in the 1920 leaving no more than 60,000. Since then, the population has grown, and by the next century as many as 30,000 people may legitimately claim aboriginal descent.
