Answer Expert Verified standard time remains fixed for the particular country. the place on the same longitude has the different standard time. Equator separates the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Prime Meridian runs through Greenwich and is at 0° longitude.

Is the Prime Meridian hot like the Equator?
-------------------------------------------

The prime meridian is the opposite of the equator. It cuts the globe in half vertically and separates the world into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The farthest point from the prime meridian is 180 degrees in either direction, which is actually the same line. 180 degrees east is the same as 180 degrees west.

What is the difference between prime meridian and standard meridian?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Just as the prime meridian is the standard for longitude, UTC is the standard for time. The Earth’s longitude measures 360, so the halfway point from the prime meridian is the 180 longitude line. The meridian at 180 longitude is commonly known as the International Date Line.
