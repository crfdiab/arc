Do volcanoes rumble before they erupt?
--------------------------------------

Each volcano has its own personality. Some rumble consistently, while others stop and start. Some rumble and erupt the same day, while others take months, and some never do erupt.

How much notice do you have before a volcano erupts?
----------------------------------------------------

Most scientists think that the buildup preceding a catastrophic eruption would be detectable for weeks and perhaps months to years. Precursors to volcanic eruptions include strong earthquake swarms and rapid ground deformation and typically take place days to weeks before an actual eruption.

Will there be a warning before Yellowstone erupts?
--------------------------------------------------

Most scientists think that the buildup preceding a catastrophic eruption would be detectable for weeks and perhaps months to years. As at many caldera systems around the world, small earthquakes, ground uplift and subsidence, and gas releases at Yellowstone are commonplace events and do not reflect impending eruptions.

How long does it take for a volcano to erupt?
---------------------------------------------

Myth: Volcanoes are dormant for a very long time, suddenly erupt, and then become dormant again. Fact: There are a wide variety of eruption lengths. Stromboli volcano off the coast of Italy has been erupting more or less continuously for over 2000 years! Other volcanoes have eruptions that last less than a day.

How long has the Stromboli volcano been erupting?

When was the last time a volcano erupted?
-----------------------------------------

Excluding steam eruptions, these volcanoes have shown activity: Mount St. Helens, Washington – Eruptions and/or lava dome growth occurred in the late 1700s, 1800-1857, 1980-1986, and 2004-2007. Lassen Peak, California – A series of steam blasts began on May 30, 1914. An eruption occurred 12 months later on May 21, 1915.

How often do volcanoes erupt in Washington State?
-------------------------------------------------

Volcanoes have been erupting in the Cascade Range for over 500,000 years. During the past 4,000 years eruptions have occurred at an average rate of about 2 per century. This chart shows 13 volcanoes on a map of Washington, Oregon, and northern California and time lines for each showing the ages of their eruptions.
