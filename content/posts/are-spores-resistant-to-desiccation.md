Are spores resistant to desiccation?
------------------------------------

Endospores can survive without nutrients. They are resistant to ultraviolet radiation, desiccation, high temperature, extreme freezing and chemical disinfectants.

Why are spores so resistant?
----------------------------

Spores are highly resistant to dehydration damage, and part of this resistance appears to be due to small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP) which bind to DNA to protect it against dehydration damage, which may involve oxidative damage (Fairhead et al., 1994).

What protects spores from environmental damage?
-----------------------------------------------

The major factor preventing damage to spore DNA is the saturation of this DNA with a novel group of small, acid-soluble proteins of the alpha/beta-type whose binding greatly alters DNA’s chemical and enzymatic reactivity as well as its UV photochemistry.

Why are spores more resistant to environmental stresses?
--------------------------------------------------------

Spores resist numerous stress factors efficiently, including extreme heat, starvation, treatment with chemicals and radiation and are able to germinate even after long periods of dormancy \[1\]\[2\]\[3\] \[4\] . This high resistance to environmental stress is due to their particular and partitioned structure \[5\]. …

At what temperature do spores die?
----------------------------------

Thermal death limits begin at 122F (50C) for spores. Most microbial cells will die at a temperature of 100 ºC. However, some bacterial spores will survive this and need temperatures around 130ºC to kill them.

What conditions are spores resistant to?
----------------------------------------

Spores are resistant to heat, dessication, chemicals, and radiation. Bacteria can form endospores in approximately 6 to 8 hours after being exposed to adverse conditions. The normally-growing cell that forms the endospore is called a vegetative cell. Spores are metabolically inactive and dehydrated.

Which bacteria are spore forming?
---------------------------------

Spore-forming bacteria include Bacillus (aerobic) and Clostridium (anaerobic) species. The spores of these species are dormant bodies that carry all the genetic material as is found in the vegetative form, but do not have an active metabolism.

Do spores multiply?
-------------------

Spore, a reproductive cell capable of developing into a new individual without fusion with another reproductive cell. Spores are agents of asexual reproduction, whereas gametes are agents of sexual reproduction. Spores are produced by bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants.

What temperature will kill spores?
----------------------------------

Temperature greater than boiling (212°F) is needed to kill spores so pressure cookers are recommended for home canning (reaching at least 250-250°F). The toxin is heat-labile though and can be destroyed at &gt; 185°F after five minutes or longer, or at &gt; 176°F for 10 minutes or longer.

Will boiling water kill spores?
-------------------------------

Although, some bacterial spores not typically associated with water borne disease are capable of surviving boiling conditions (e.g. clostridium and bacillus spores), research shows that water borne pathogens are inactivated or killed at temperatures below boiling (212°F or 100°C).

What makes a spore so difficult to kill?
----------------------------------------

DPA has the ability to cross-link with calcium that is embedded within the spore coat. The calcium cross-links contribute to the heat resistance of the bacterium making for a hard barrier to penetrate. The endospore makes it difficult to kill bacteria.

Which is part of the spore provides chemical resistance?
--------------------------------------------------------

The outer proteinaceous coat surrounding the spore provides much of the chemical and enzymatic resistance. Beneath the coat resides a very thick layer of specialized peptidoglycan called the cortex. Proper cortex formation is needed for dehydration of the spore core, which aids in resistance to high temperature.

How are spores of Bacillus resistant to heat?
---------------------------------------------

A number of mechanisms are responsible for the resistance of spores of Bacillus species to heat, radiation and chemicals and for spore killing by these agents. Spore resistance to wet heat is determined largely by the water content of spore core, which is much lower than that in the growing cell protoplast.

What makes a spore resistant to UV radiation?
---------------------------------------------

In contrast, spore UV resistance is due largely to an alteration in spore DNA photochemistry caused by the binding of α / β -type SASP to the DNA, and to a lesser extent to the photosensitizing action of the spore core’s large pool of dipicolinic acid.

How are spores killed by other life forms?
------------------------------------------

Despite their extreme resistance, spores can be killed, including by damage to DNA, crucial spore proteins, the spore’s inner membrane, and one or more components of the spore germination apparatus.
