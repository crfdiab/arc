When did the Byzantine Empire take over Greece?
-----------------------------------------------

The Byzantine Empire came about a few hundred years after the Romans came to Greece. After Constantinople was founded, Greece became part of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Byzantine Empire was technically in existence from 330 A.D. to around 1453 A.D with the Fall of Constantinople.

Who conquered the Byzantine and Persian Empire?
-----------------------------------------------

Emperor Heraclius  
Between the years 621 and 626 A.D., the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius waged a bloody, ravaging, and exhausting war on the Persian Empire. In retrospect, three compelling reasons for such an enterprise stand out. First, to end the Persian conquests of Byzantine territory. Second, to stop Christian setbacks at their hands.

When did the Byzantine Empire end?
----------------------------------

1453

When was the ancient Greek city state of Byzantium founded?
-----------------------------------------------------------

657 BCE  
The ancient city of Byzantium was founded by Greek colonists from Megara around 657 BCE. According to the historian Tacitus, it was built on the European side of the Strait of Bosporus on the order of the “god of Delphi” who said to build “opposite the land of the blind”.

What does Byzantium mean in Greek?
----------------------------------

Byzantinós (Medieval Greek: Βυζαντινός, Latin: Byzantinus) denoted an inhabitant of the empire. Later, the name Byzantium became common in the West to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire, whose capital was Constantinople.

How long did the Persian invasion of Greece last?
-------------------------------------------------

The second Persian invasion of Greece lasted about two years. The Greek counterattacks continued from 478 until 449 BCE. The Greeks were unable to come close to bringing down the Persian Empire, but they took much of Ionia and incited some revolts in Egypt.

Where did the Greeks live in the Byzantine Empire?
--------------------------------------------------

They were the main inhabitants of the lands of the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire), of Constantinople and Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the Greek islands, Cyprus, and portions of the southern Balkans, and formed large minorities, or pluralities, in the coastal urban centres of the Levant and northern Egypt.

When did the Arabs overran the Byzantine Empire?
------------------------------------------------

At the expiration of this truce in 638–639, the Arabs overran Byzantine Mesopotamia and Byzantine Armenia, and terminated the conquest of Palestine by storming Caesarea Maritima and effecting their final capture of Ascalon. In December 639, the Muslims departed from Palestine to invade Egypt in early 640.

When did the Byzantines give up the city of Alexandria?
-------------------------------------------------------

The Byzantines, divided and shocked by the sudden loss of so much territory, agreed to give up the city by September 642. The fall of Alexandria extinguished Byzantine rule in Egypt, and allowed the Muslims to continue their military expansion into North Africa; between 643–644 ‘Amr completed the conquest of Cyrenaica.
