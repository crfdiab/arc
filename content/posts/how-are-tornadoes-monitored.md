How are tornadoes monitored?
----------------------------

A Doppler radar can detect wind speed and direction, rotation often signifies tornadic development. Once a tornado is detected, both radars and satellites are used to track the storm. Satellite images often show details of tornado damage, especially from high resolution POES images as seen below.

Can humans do anything to prevent tornadoes?
--------------------------------------------

Although nothing can be done to prevent tornadoes, there are actions you can take for your health and safety. Illnesses, injuries, carbon monoxide poisoning, animals &amp; insects, food, water, cleanup, mold, environmental concerns, and coping with a disaster. Learn more.

Why go in a ditch during a tornado?
-----------------------------------

You’ve heard it repeated often over the years during tornado warnings: If a tornado approaches you while you’re driving, abandon your vehicle and seek shelter in a ditch. A ditch is a poor escape option if it’s rapidly filling with water. There’s no point in surviving a tornado only to drown in a flash flood.

Is there any way to control a tornado?
--------------------------------------

And lo, it turns out that researchers are currently hard at work devising ways to control the weather–particularly disastrous weather systems like tornados and hurricanes–and hope to put their ideas to the test in the coming decades. Any storm depends on a host of complex, interrelated drivers, like heat flows and wind movements.

How does the air pressure in a tornado work?
--------------------------------------------

The air pressure inside a tornado is as much as 10 percent lower than that of the surrounding air, causing the surrounding air to rush in even faster. A tornado descends from the mesocyclone of a thunderstorm over New Mexico.

What are the flight controls on a Panavia Tornado?
--------------------------------------------------

The primary flight controls of the Tornado are a fly-by-wire hybrid, consisting of an analogue quadruplex Command and Stability Augmentation System (CSAS) connected to a digital Autopilot &amp; Flight Director System (AFDS). In addition a level of mechanical reversion capacity was retained to safeguard against potential failure.

What happens when a tornado touches the ground?
-----------------------------------------------

If the vortex touches ground, the speed of the whirling wind (as well as the updraft and the pressure differences) can cause tremendous damage, tearing apart homes and flinging potentially lethal debris. The tornado follows a path that is controlled by the route of its parent thundercloud, and it will often appear to hop.
