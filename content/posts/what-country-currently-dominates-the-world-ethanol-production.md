What country currently dominates the world ethanol production?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Ethanol fuel production in top countries 2020 In 2020, the United States produced the greatest amount of fuel ethanol in the world, generating some 13.8 billion gallons in total. With nearly 7.9 billion gallons, Brazil was ranked second.

Who is the largest ethanol producer?
------------------------------------

Poet Biorefining  
Largest ethanol producers by capacity in the U.S. 2020 Poet Biorefining is the largest ethanol producer in the United States. As of 2020, the South Dakota-based company has a ethanol production capacity of two billion gallons per annum across 27 plants in the Midwest.

Why is the US the largest producer of ethanol?
----------------------------------------------

One rationale for ethanol production in the U.S. is increased energy security, from shifting supply from oil imports to domestic sources. Ethanol production requires significant energy, and current U.S. production derives most of that energy from domestic coal, natural gas and other non-oil sources.

Which country is leader in use of bioethanol and why?
-----------------------------------------------------

The United States of America is the top country by biofuels consumption in the world. As of 2019, biofuels consumption in the United States of America was 1,067.48 thousand barrels per day.

Does gas in Japan have ethanol?
-------------------------------

Japan currently allows ethanol mixtures of up to 3 percent at the nation’s pumps, but in practice “almost no cars” run on the fuel, Sekiya said.

Which country produces the least amount of ethanol in the world?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Switzerland has poor E85 coverage, with some cantons without any E85 pumps at service stations, and it is also significantly more expensive than in neighbouring countries, as by law it must be produced from wood waste, rather than specifically grown crops, to avoid competing for agricultural land with food crops.

Why are ethanol plants closing?
-------------------------------

The coronavirus and cheap oil are hitting the fuel business so hard that ethanol plants are shutting down. Some may never come back. The entire biofuel industry is facing a reckoning. Long before the pandemic emptied roads and exacerbated an oil price war, producers were battling chronic oversupply and trade upheaval.

What plant produces the most ethanol?
-------------------------------------

Corn  
Corn is the leading U.S. crop and serves as the feedstock for most domestic ethanol production. Corn ethanol meets the renewable fuel category of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which is limited to 15 billion gallons.

What are the disadvantages of ethanol?
--------------------------------------

Disadvantages of Ethanol Fuel

- Requires a Large Piece of Land. We’ve learned that ethanol is produced from corn, sugarcane, and grains.
- The Distillation Process is Not Good For the Environment.
- Spike in Food Prices.
- Affinity For Water.
- Difficult to Vaporize. Is ethanol toxic to humans?
    ---------------------------
    
    While ethanol is consumed when drinking alcoholic beverages, consuming ethanol alone can cause coma and death. However, ethanol is a toxic chemical and should be treated and handled as such, whether at work or in the home.
    
    Who is the largest producer of ethanol in India?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    Uttar Pradesh has emerged as the largest ethanol-producing state in the country. A total of 58 crore litres of ethanol was produced by 54 distilleries established across the state.
    
    Does Japan use ethanol?
    -----------------------
    
    Japan achieved an average ethanol blend rate of 1.6 percent in 2019. That is equivalent to approximately 823.7 million liters of ethanol. The mandate is currently fulfilled entirely through the use of ethanol to produce bio-ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), which is used as a gasoline additive.
    
    Which is the largest producer of ethanol in the world?
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
    Global production continues to increase. The United States is the world’s largest producer of ethanol, having produced over 15.7 billion gallons in 2019. Together, the United States and Brazil produce 84% of the world’s ethanol. The vast majority of U.S. ethanol is produced from corn, while Brazil primarily uses sugarcane.
    
    How much ethanol does the United States use?
    --------------------------------------------
    
    In 2007, The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) raised the target of renewable fuel usage to 36 billion gallons by 2022. In 2016, fuel producers added about 14 billion gallons of ethanol to gasoline in the United States.
    
    Where are the ethanol plants located in China?
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    The cities include Zhengzhou, Luoyang and Nanyang in central China’s Henan province, and Harbin and Zhaodong in Heilongjiang province, northeast China. Under the program, Henan will promote ethanol-based fuel across the province by the end of this year.
    
    How much ethanol does the Brazilian government use?
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    In 2006 Brazilian ethanol provided 18% of the country’s road transport sector fuel consumption needs, and by April 2008, more than 50% of fuel consumption for the gasoline market.
