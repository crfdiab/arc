How are earthquakes destructive and constructive?
-------------------------------------------------

Earthquakes can be both a constructive and destructive force. When the fault lines move they can cause incredible damage (destructive) and they also can cause new land formations (constructive). Mostly though, earthquakes cause destruction.

Are volcanoes constructive or destructive and why?
--------------------------------------------------

To scientists, volcanoes are known as “constructive” forces. That is, volcanoes often result in the construction of new landforms. “Destructive” forces are those like erosion or weathering in which landforms are broken down into smaller pieces like soil and sand. Some volcanic mountains form on continental land masses.

How are volcanoes considered both constructive and destructive?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Volcanoes are both destructive and constructive forces. They are constructive because cooled lava is good for the soil. Volcanoes are destructive because the lava can start fires and burn things like houses, trees, and people.

In what way are volcanoes a constructive force?
-----------------------------------------------

Volcanoes are constructive forces in that they create new land, fertilize existing lands and bring many new minerals to the surface of the planet. Volcanoes also bring heat to the areas surrounding them and attract wildlife on land and beneath the sea.

What is the driving force that changes the Earth’s surfaces?
------------------------------------------------------------

The Earth’s surface is constantly changing through forces in nature. The daily processes of precipitation, wind and land movement result in changes to landforms over a long period of time. Driving forces include erosion, volcanoes and earthquakes. People also contribute to changes in the appearance of land.

How are volcanoes both constructive and destructive forces?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Volcanoes are both destructive and constructive forces. They are constructive because cooled lava is good for the soil. Volcanoes are destructive because the lava can start fires and burn things like houses, trees, and people. Some forces are only constructive, while others are destructive.

Which is more destructive, a volcano or an earthquake?
------------------------------------------------------

Many souls are surprised that volcanos are very constructive. When a volcano erupts its magma (lava) shoots very far. Therefore when it dries it makes new land form, far from the eruption. Earthquakes are almost always destructive. They occur thousands of time each day on this earth. Earthquakes shake the ground causing it to be displaced.

How are earth quakes constructive and destructive forces?
---------------------------------------------------------

This helps build up land or habitats for animals. A fun fact is when a earthquake makes a sink hole or trench many people come to see it for enjoyment. Earth quakes are vibrations between multiple plates under ground that cause the crust of the earth to tremble. Floods are both constructive and destructive.

How does a volcano affect the land around it?
---------------------------------------------

Volcanoes also bring heat to the areas surrounding them and attract wildlife on land and beneath the sea. Volcanoes create new land when molten rock, or magma, flows up from inside of the planet. The magma emerges as lava, and as it cools, it solidifies into rock again and creates new land.
