How was irrigation system developed in ancient Mesopotamia?
-----------------------------------------------------------

2000 B.C.E. ) depicts Egyptians using water from the Nile River for irrigation. Both the Mesopotamian irrigation system and that in the Egyptian delta were of the basin type, which were opened by digging a gap in the embankment and closed by placing mud back into the gap. Water was hoisted using the swape, as in Egypt.

How did Mesopotamia benefit from irrigation?
--------------------------------------------

The Mesopotamians depended on their irrigation to provide all of their water, and without it, there most likely would have been no Mesopotamia at ALL. The irrigation also played a large role in the opposite respect: They would redirect water from the river during the flood season, saving countless crops in the process.

How did the people of ancient Mesopotamia deal with flooding?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The area saw very little rainfall, so the people of the region depended on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for fresh water. They depended particularly on the riversâ€™ annual floods, which covered the land with silt from the riverbeds.

What did Mesopotamian engineers have to do with irrigation?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Mesopotamian engineers had to worry about water storage and flood control as well as irrigation. \[1\] Irrigation works therefore had to be passive in construction, and built relatively high along the river bank so that they dealt only with the peak of the flood. \[1\]

What was the function of irrigation in ancient Egypt?
-----------------------------------------------------

The ancient Egyptians built large flat-bottomed basins for growing crops along the river banks, and simple sluices that diverted water into them at the peak of the flood. \[9\]

Where was the irrigation of the Sumerians located?
--------------------------------------------------

The eighteen recorded Sumerian cities of southern Mesopotamia remained concentrated along the branches and irrigation canals of the Euphrates in a narrow strip of land extending from south of present-day Baghdad to the marches bordering the Gulf. \[12\]
