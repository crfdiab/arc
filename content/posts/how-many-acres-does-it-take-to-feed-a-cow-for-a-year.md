How many acres does it take to feed a cow for a year?
-----------------------------------------------------

Feed. The pasture or range acreage needed for each cow is 10 to 12 acres per year.

How much forage does a cow need per day?
----------------------------------------

Cows will voluntarily consume 2.0% of body weight or 24 pounds per day. The 24 pounds is based on 100% dry matter. Grass hays will often be 7 to 10% moisture. If we assume that the hay is 92% dry matter or 8% moisture, then the cows will consume about 26 pounds per day on an “as-fed basis”.

Is 1 acre big enough for a cow?
-------------------------------

It is surprising how quickly a cow or two can eat down a small pasture. However, you will need to purchase hay to feed them because one acre is not enough land to support anything bovine. Cows can indeed be kept on small plots—an acre or two—but they must be fed.

How much does a cow eat in one day?
-----------------------------------

High producing dairy cows will eat 110 to 120 pounds of wet feed a day or 50 to 55 pounds of dry matter (DM) a day. As cows produce more milk, they eat more. A typical diet for a dairy cow could include about 30 to 35 pounds of baled hay (26-30 pounds DM) and 25 pounds of grain mix (22 pounds DM).

What is too cold for cows?
--------------------------

In wet conditions cattle can begin experiencing cold stress at 59°F, which would be a relatively mild winter day. However, if cattle have time to develop a sufficient winter coat the estimated lower critical temperature under dry conditions is 18°F.

How many cows should I have on 20 acres?
----------------------------------------

You may have heard a rule-of-thumb is that it takes 1.5 to 2 acres to feed a cow calf pair for 12 months. That means we should be able to have 10 to 13 cows. Let’s see how this rule-of-thumb holds up. It looks like our rule-of-thumb held up pretty good, 11 cows on 20 acres, is 1.8 acres per cow.

How much forage does a cow eat in a day?
----------------------------------------

There are some “thumb rules” to help estimate daily feed intake of cows on a dry matter basis consuming forages of differing quality when they are either gestating or lactating. When forage quality is low (52% TDN or less) and cows are not lactating, they will consume 1.8% and lactating cows about 2.0% of their weight on a dry matter basis.

How to determine how many acres of pasture are required?
--------------------------------------------------------

Calculate the total number of animal units you have. The animal unit (AU) is the standard unit for stocking pastures. It is based on the amount that a cow or cow-calf pair will consume on a daily or monthly basis. The AU is based on the size of cows back in the early 20th century. Cows have gotten much bigger today.

Why is it important to know your cow’s daily feed intake?
---------------------------------------------------------

Estimating daily feed intake of your cow herd is the first step in determining the amount of forage that is needed to be on-hand for a harvested forage feeding program. When forage availability is tight like it is during drought, being able to determine how much inventory needed will help enhance the profit potential of the cow/calf enterprise.
