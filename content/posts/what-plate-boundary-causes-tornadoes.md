What plate boundary causes tornadoes?
-------------------------------------

Famous examples of transform plate boundaries on land include the San Andreas fault in California, the Dead Sea Transform in the Middle East, the East Anatolian transform in Turkey, and the Alpine fault in New Zealand.

Can plate tectonics cause tornadoes?
------------------------------------

A great variety of natural hazards occur on Earth, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, landslides, floods, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, and avalanches. The most destructive of these hazards, earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions, are mostly associated with tectonic plate boundaries.

How do plate tectonics cause natural disasters?
-----------------------------------------------

Earthquakes occur when the plate boundaries get stuck together but the plates themselves keep moving. Volcanoes occur when plates crash into or pull away from each other and hot magma from below rises up to the surface in an eruption.

What causes a tornado to form in a thunderstorm?
------------------------------------------------

A lot of people wonder: “How do tornadoes form?” These severe weather events typically stem from thunderstorms, although they don’t have to. Wind shear is one of the most critical components for the formation of a tornado. Wind shear is the change of direction and speed of the wind with height.

Where do tornadoes occur in the Great Plains?
---------------------------------------------

Tornado Alley is a nickname for the Great Plains where tornadoes often occur. This is the graphic our Chief Meteorologist, Mark Hoekzema, refers to when explaining Tornado Alley. This is the area in the Central United States between the Rockies and the Appalachian Mountains.

Is it true that tornadoes only form on flat land?
-------------------------------------------------

Tornado Myth #2: Tornadoes only form on flat land. While tornadoes are most common in the Great Plains that doesn’t mean they only form on flat land! Rivers, mountains, valleys, and tall buildings do not stop tornadoes from forming. Tornadoes impact large cities and can even form on water (these are known as waterspouts).

How does wind shear affect the formation of a tornado?
------------------------------------------------------

Wind shear is one of the most critical components for the formation of a tornado. Wind shear is the change of direction and speed of the wind with height. This can create a horizontal spinning effect within a storm cell.
