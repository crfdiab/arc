How is electricity distributed to homes?
----------------------------------------

From the distribution substation, distribution lines go out to the streets to carry the electricity to different places where the consumers are located. The TRANSMISSION SUBSTATION. high levels through step- up power transformer in the transmission substation. The TRANSMISSION LINES.

Is there only one way to generate electricity?
----------------------------------------------

Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power.

What processes does electricity have to go through in order to reach us at home?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The electricity that flows to our homes is generated in power stations. From here, it flows through large transmission lines, which carry it to substations. Finally, distribution lines carry electricity from substations to houses, businesses, and schools like yours!

Why do we get different rates for electricity?
----------------------------------------------

Depending on how much it costs to generate that power and how much the suppliers can get it for, all influences how much the companies charge their consumers. These factors all play a major role in what ends up being the final rate or cost per kWh for energy consumers.

How are electricity, energy and power the same?
-----------------------------------------------

Power is energy per unit of time – the rate of producing or consuming energy, whether it be by mechanical, solar, horse power, or other means. What actually flows through electrical lines and cables into electronics/appliances.

What kind of electricity moves from one place to another?
---------------------------------------------------------

When electricity gathers in one place it is known as static electricity (the word static means something that does not move); electricity that moves from one place to another is called current electricity. Photo: Lightning happens when static electricity (built up in one place) turns to current electricity (flowing from one place to another).
