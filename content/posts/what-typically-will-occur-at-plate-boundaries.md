What typically will occur at plate boundaries?
----------------------------------------------

Movement in narrow zones along plate boundaries causes most earthquakes. Most seismic activity occurs at three types of plate boundaries—divergent, convergent, and transform. As the plates move past each other, they sometimes get caught and pressure builds up.

What are 2 plate boundary hazards?
----------------------------------

Some of the most destructive natural hazards that occur on Earth—earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions—are associated with tectonic plate boundaries.

What plate boundaries are the most destructive?
-----------------------------------------------

 Plate boundaries Destructive plate boundary. A destructive plate boundary is sometimes called a convergent or tensional plate margin. Collision zones. Collision zones form when two continental plates collide. Constructive plate boundary. A constructive plate boundary, sometimes called a divergent plate margin, occurs when plates move apart. Conservative plate boundary. …

What are the four types of plate boundaries?
--------------------------------------------

The point where two or more plates meet is known as a plate boundary. There are four main types of plate boundary. These are constructive, destructive, conservative and collision margins.

What are plate boundaries, and what takes place there?
------------------------------------------------------

The location where two plates meet is called a plate boundary. Plate boundaries are commonly associated with geological events such as earthquakes and the creation of topographic features such as mountains, volcanoes, mid-ocean ridges, and oceanic trenches . The majority of the world’s active volcanoes occur along plate boundaries, with the Pacific Plate’s Ring of Fire being the most active and widely known today. These boundaries are discussed in further detail below.

What happens at continental-continental plate boundary?
-------------------------------------------------------

Continental crust is too buoyant to subduct. If the two plates that meet at a convergent plate boundary both consist of continental crust, they will smash together and push upwards to create mountains. Large slabs of lithosphere smashing together create large earthquakes.
