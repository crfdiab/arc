What did Columbus want for himself?
-----------------------------------

Columbus wanted to find a new route to India, China, Japan and the Spice Islands. If he could reach these lands, he would be able to bring back rich cargoes of silks and spices.

What were Columbus goals for himself and his voyage?
----------------------------------------------------

The explorer Christopher Columbus made four trips across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain: in 1492, 1493, 1498 and 1502. He was determined to find a direct water route west from Europe to Asia, but he never did. Instead, he stumbled upon the Americas.

What did Christopher Columbus find on his voyage?
-------------------------------------------------

Columbus set out on his initial voyage with two significant goals: He would discover a sea trade route to Asia and he would find untold treasure. Despite the fact that he never discovered large amounts of gold, he did return to Europe with other savory treasures, including pineapples, oranges and cocoa.

Why did Christopher Columbus want to go to India?
-------------------------------------------------

At a time when European empires began to establish new trade routes and colonies inspired by imperialism and economic competition, Columbus proposed crossing the West and reaching the East Indian Territory. Which received the support of the Spanish Crown. Later Columbus discovered America instead of India.

Why did the King of Spain sponsor Christopher Columbus?
-------------------------------------------------------

While some doubted that Columbus would be successful, the King and Queen of Spain were willing to take a chance on his voyage. Thus, they sponsored his voyage. The King and Queen of Spain viewed his voyage as a way to gain fame and fortune. If Columbus was successful, they might be able to claim any minerals he discovered.

Where did Christopher Columbus live as a child?
-----------------------------------------------

Columbus was born in the Italian seaport of Genoa in 1451, to a family of wool weavers. As a young lad he went to sea and became an experienced sailor. He then moved to Lisbon, Portugal, to gain support for a journey he was planning to find new trade routes to the Far East.
