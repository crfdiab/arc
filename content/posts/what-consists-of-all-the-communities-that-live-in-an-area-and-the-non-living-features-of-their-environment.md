What consists of all the communities that live in an area and the non living features of their environment?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the living things, or organisms, and nonliving things that interact in a particular area make up an ecosystem.

What is all the living and nonliving factors in an area called?
---------------------------------------------------------------

An ecosystem is a biological environment consisting of all the organisms living in a particular area, as well as all the nonliving (abiotic), physical components of the environment with which the organisms interact, such as air, soil, water and sunlight.

What is made up of all populations in an area?
----------------------------------------------

A community includes all the populations of the area. The community and the abiotic factors make up the ecosystem. An organism lives in its habitat within a community.

Which of the following are all nonliving parts of an environment?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The non-living components of the environment are known as abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include things such as rocks,water,soil,light,rocks etc…

Which of the following is an example of how an abiotic component affects a community?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following is an example of how an abiotic component affects a community? A change in an abiotic factor. Fungi break down dead plants and release nutrients back into the soil. Plants get nutrients from the soil therefore.

What are the nonliving parts of the environment called?
-------------------------------------------------------

An abiotic factor is a non-living part of an ecosystem that shapes its environment. In a terrestrial ecosystem, examples might include temperature, light, and water.

What is the physical environment where an organism lives?
---------------------------------------------------------

A habitat is a place where an organism makes its home. A habitat meets all the environmental conditions an organism needs to survive.

What makes up a community of living things?
-------------------------------------------

All of the populations that live in the same area make up a community. The community that includes the goldfish population also includes the populations of other fish, coral, and other organisms. An ecosystem consists of all the living things ( biotic factors) in a given area, together with the nonliving environment ( abiotic factors ).

Which is an example of a nonliving environment?
-----------------------------------------------

The nonliving environment includes water, sunlight, soil, and other physical factors. A group of similar ecosystems with the same general type of physical environment is called a biome. The biosphere is the part of Earth where all life exists, including all the land, water, and air where living things can be found.

What makes up the living things in an ecosystem?
------------------------------------------------

An ecosystem consists of all the living things ( biotic factors) in a given area, together with the nonliving environment ( abiotic factors ). The nonliving environment includes water, sunlight, soil, and other physical factors. A group of similar ecosystems with the same general type of physical environment is called a biome.

What’s the difference between a habitat and a community?
--------------------------------------------------------

T/F (If false, change to make it true) A HABITAT refers to all the populations in an ecosystem. False; community T/F (If false, change to make it true) A COMMUNITY consists of all the organisms in an ecosystem that belong to the same species.
