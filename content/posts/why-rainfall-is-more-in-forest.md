Why rainfall is more in forest?
-------------------------------

The dense forest area’s atmosphere is comparatively cooler than the surroundings because the forest plants evaporates a lot of moisture in the atmosphere which brings down the atmospheric temperature. In this way,the dense forest lands get more amount of rainfall.

How does rain help forests?
---------------------------

They also control water runoff rates by collecting rainwater and allowing it to flow away in a steady stream, thus reducing the risk of flooding and landslides. This also prevents soil erosion, which means that less Earth and fewer nutrients needed for agriculture are lost.

Do forests increase rainfall?
-----------------------------

In so doing, they found evidence that planting forests in desert areas can lead to an increase in rainfall. The models showed that water vapor was able to condense on the particles, resulting in the formation of rain droplets. And finally, the texture of the trees resulted in changing wind patterns.

Why do trees need rain?
-----------------------

Trees make rain. Like air conditioners, trees cool and humidify air. They slow drying winds, make oxygen, bind soil, purify air, cycle nutrients, build soil carbon and buffer weather extremes. Trees do it all for free.

What’s the relationship between trees and rain?
-----------------------------------------------

They found that for more than 60 percent of the tropical land surface, air that has passed over extensive vegetation in the preceding few days produces at least twice as much rain as air that has passed over little vegetation.

Do trees promote rain?
----------------------

As those clouds release rain, they warm the atmosphere, causing air to rise and triggering circulation. Scientists have studied the connection between trees and rain in the Amazon before. A 2012 study found that plants help “seed” the atmosphere for rain by releasing tiny salt particles.

Why do some trees make more rain than others?
---------------------------------------------

This phenomenon is caused by trees releasing water vapour through pores in their leaves called stomata. We also know that many big forests, and rainforests in particular, tend to get more rain than surrounding areas — hence the name.

Is it true that forests do not cause rain?
------------------------------------------

Forests were understood to create rain within a locality and region. Scientific consensus shifted by the early twentieth century to the view that forests did not play a significant role in determining rainfall.

What are the benefits of regrowing the rain forest?
---------------------------------------------------

Research has shown regrowing forests could have “significant benefit” on rainfall. In regions dominated by tropical rainforest, research has shown that those forests can significantly influence broad-scale rain patterns.

How is rain related to the greening of forests?
-----------------------------------------------

Around the same time, researchers have noticed that the forest tends to build up low-lying cloud and rains increase. Last year, researchers showed that the “greening” of the forest and increased atmospheric moisture were connected, and they used a hydrogen isotope to do it.
