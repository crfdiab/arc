What do longitude lines do at the north and South Poles?
--------------------------------------------------------

Longitude is the measurement east or west of the prime meridian. Longitude is measured by imaginary lines that run around the Earth vertically (up and down) and meet at the North and South Poles. These lines are known as meridians. The distance around the Earth measures 360 degrees.

Does latitude or longitude run north and south?
-----------------------------------------------

Merdians and Parallels The lines running North to South are called “Meridians” or “lines of longitude” (Figure 2), while the lines running East to West are called “Parallels” or “lines of latitude” (Figure 3).

Is the South Pole high or low latitude?
---------------------------------------

The high latitude area in the Southern Hemisphere is located between the Antarctic Circle, at 66 degrees 33 minutes south latitude, and the South Pole, at 90 degrees south latitude.

What’s the difference between the north and South Poles?
--------------------------------------------------------

Notable Latitudes. The Equator represents 0° latitude, while the North and South Poles represent 90° North and 90° South latitudes. In addition to the Equator, there are four other major latitudes that are usually found on maps and globes.

How are latitudes related to the longitudes of the Earth?
---------------------------------------------------------

Latitudes are angles that range from zero degrees at the equator to 90 degrees North or 90 degrees South at the poles. All latitude lines are parallel, and they run from East to West as circles, which are parallel to the equator. Together with the longitudes, latitudes are used to indicate a precise location of any feature on the earth’s surface.

How are latitudes measured from the equator to the Poles?
---------------------------------------------------------

All parallel circles from the equator up to the poles are called parallels of latitudes. Latitudes are measured in degrees. The equator represents the zero degree latitude. Since the distance from the equator to either of the poles is one-fourth of a circle round the earth, it will measure ˜thof 360 degrees, i.e. 90°.

Where do the lines of latitude and longitude meet?
--------------------------------------------------

All meridians meet at the North and South Poles. Longitude is related to latitude, the measurement of distance north or south of the Equator. Lines of latitude are called parallel s. Maps are often marked with parallels and meridians, creating a grid. The point in the grid where parallels and meridians intersect is called a coordinate.
