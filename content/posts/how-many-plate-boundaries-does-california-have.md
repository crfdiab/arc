How many plate boundaries does California have?
-----------------------------------------------

three  
Plate boundaries and california. There are three main types of plate boundaries, where stresses cause rocks to deform. Many of California’s landforms were produced by plate tectonic activity, which continues today.

What is the example of convergent boundaries?
---------------------------------------------

Examples of continent-continent convergent boundaries are the collision of the India Plate with the Eurasian Plate, creating the Himalaya Mountains, and the collision of the African Plate with the Eurasian Plate, creating the series of ranges extending from the Alps in Europe to the Zagros Mountains in Iran.

Where are examples of convergent boundaries?
--------------------------------------------

Examples. The collision between the Eurasian Plate and the Indian Plate that is forming the Himalayas. Subduction of the northern part of the Pacific Plate and the NW North American Plate that is forming the Aleutian Islands. Subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate to form the Andes.

Where does California lie on the plate boundary?
------------------------------------------------

Transform Plate Boundary. Most of California is situated on the North American Plate. A small part of Cal- ifornia, west of the San Andreas Fault, lies on the adjacent Pacific Plate. The Pacific Plate moves northwest, relative to the North American Plate, at a velocity of about 3.4 cm per year.

What kind of boundary is the San Andreas Fault?
-----------------------------------------------

Explanation: The San Andreas Fault is where the Pacific plate collides with the North American plate. this is a convergent boundary. The two plates hit an angle in California. This forms a transverse fault in stead of the subduction zone usually found where an Ocean Plate and a Continatial plate meet.

How are the different types of plate boundaries different?
----------------------------------------------------------

There are three types of tectonic plate boundaries: Plates rip apart at a divergent plate boundary, causing volcanic activity and shallow earthquakes; At a convergent plate boundary, one plate dives (“subducts”) beneath the other, resulting in a variety of earthquakes and a line of volcanoes on the overriding plate;

Are there any fault lines between California and Nevada?
--------------------------------------------------------

California and Nevada share more than just a border—they share faults. The fault shown in this photo lies within the Sierra Nevada. About 25 million years ago, the Sierra Nevada started to rise and tilt to the west.
