How much does it rain in the Andes?
-----------------------------------

The rain fall in the summer averages less than 8 in. In the winter it averages less than 4 in. These numbers are from biomes in and around the Andes Mountains. The Andes Mountain climate extends from at latitude 10°North latitude to 50° South and longitude 65° to 80° West.

Where is the most rainfall in the Andes?
----------------------------------------

Hotspot regions are identified at low elevations in the Andes foothills (400–700 masl) and in windward conditions, which is the case of Quincemil-San Gabán (Peru) and in Chipiriri-Cristal Mayu (Bolivia), where more than 4000 mm rain fall per year.

How is precipitation different on both sides of the Andes?
----------------------------------------------------------

In the subtropical Andes (25–35°S), annual mean precipitation is similar on both sides, however, it falls from convective and stratiform precipitating clouds in the warm semester on the eastern slopes, and from stratiform precipitating clouds in the cold semester, mostly as frozen particles, on the western slopes.

How does the Andes cordillera affect the climate?
-------------------------------------------------

The prominent Andes cordillera induces significant differences in climates between its eastern and western slopes. These climatic differences are largely reflected by contrasting vegetation and ice coverages but remain poorly documented.
