------------------------------------------------

How many red and white stripes are on the American flag?
--------------------------------------------------------

thirteen stripes  
The principal acts affecting the flag of the United States are the following: Flag Resolution of June 14, 1777 – stated: “Resolved: that the flag of the United States be made of thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation.”

The flag of the United States of America has seven red stripes and six white stripes. Officially the red stripes signify valor and bravery, while the white stripes symbolize purity and innocence. There are 13 stripes to represent the original 13 American colonies that rebelled against Great Britain.

What are the changes in the American flag?
------------------------------------------

The design replaces white with red. Blue is swapped out for black and red from the traditional design. The stripe pattern starts and ends with a dark stripe. The shade of red used is a bit brighter than the red we are used to seeing on the American flag.

What’s the difference between the US flag and the Old Glory flag?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Red replaces white and, and black replaces blue and red in the normal flag, so the overall stripe pattern still starts and ends with a dark stripe, even though the red gets swapped. (The shade of red seems to be lighter than Old Glory Red, though this might be irrelevant.)

What do the colors of the American flag mean?
---------------------------------------------

The colors of the flag are symbolic as well; red symbolizes hardiness and valor, white symbolizes purity and innocence, and blue represents vigilance, perseverance and justice.
