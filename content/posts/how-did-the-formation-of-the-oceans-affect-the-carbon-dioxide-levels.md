How did the formation of the oceans affect the carbon dioxide levels?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Formation of sedimentary rocks As the oceans formed, carbon dioxide dissolved to form soluble carbonate compounds so its amount in the atmosphere decreased. Carbonate compounds were then precipitated as sedimentary rocks, eg limestone.

How do seas and oceans decrease the amount of CO2?
--------------------------------------------------

The ocean takes up carbon dioxide through photosynthesis by plant-like organisms (phytoplankton), as well as by simple chemistry: carbon dioxide dissolves in water. As we burn fossil fuels and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels go up, the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide to stay in balance.

What role did the newly formed oceans play in reducing CO2?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The oceans play a significant role in absorbing greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, and heat from the atmosphere. Along the journey north, water near the surface absorbs greenhouse gases, which sink down as the water cools near Greenland. In this way, the ocean effectively buries the gases deep below the surface.

Which types of animals will be most affected if the oceans become more acidic?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shell-forming animals like corals, crabs, oysters and urchins are getting hit first because ocean acidification robs seawater of the compounds these creatures need to build shells and skeletons, impairing their development and, ultimately, their survival.

What absorbs most CO2?
----------------------

The ocean is great at sucking up CO2 from the air. It absorbs about one-quarter of the CO2 that we humans create when we burn fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas.) If not for the ocean, we’d be in even worse trouble with too much CO2. The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere wherever air meets water.

What is the leading cause of ocean acidification?
-------------------------------------------------

Ocean acidification is mainly caused by carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere dissolving into the ocean. This leads to a lowering of the water’s pH, making the ocean more acidic. Many factors contribute to rising carbon dioxide levels.

What happens when carbon dioxide is added to the ocean?
-------------------------------------------------------

But as the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, even more is added to the ocean, and it changes the water’s chemistry. As shown in the first equation above, gaseous carbon dioxide dissolves in ocean surface water to produce aqueous carbon dioxide.

Why does the ocean have more dissolved gases than the atmosphere?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If the ocean and atmosphere stayed the same, there would be a balance between the concentrations of carbon dioxide in each, but carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are rising, so more of the gas is dissolving in the ocean. gases: The state of matter distinguished from the solid and liquid states.

How does stratification affect the amount of carbon in the ocean?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Without an infusion of fresh carbonate-rich water from below, the surface water saturates with carbon dioxide. The stagnant water also supports fewer phytoplankton, and carbon dioxide uptake from photosynthesis slows. In short, stratification cuts down the amount of carbon the ocean can take up.

How does the temperature of the ocean affect the carbon balance?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The warmer the surface water becomes, the harder it is for winds to mix the surface layers with the deeper layers. The ocean settles into layers, or stratifies. Without an infusion of fresh carbonate-rich water from below, the surface water saturates with carbon dioxide.
