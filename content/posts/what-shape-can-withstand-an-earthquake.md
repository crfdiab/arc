What shape can withstand an earthquake?
---------------------------------------

Shake Table Test Shows the Dome Shape is Virtually Earthquake-Proof. In April, 2005, at the University of British Columbia in the Department of Civil Engineering’s Earthquake Engineering Research Facility, researchers put the wood frame of a 24 foot-diameter dome to the test on a shake table.

What materials can you use to make your house earthquake resistant?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Brick and concrete buildings have low ductility and therefore absorb very little energy. This makes them especially vulnerable in even minor earthquakes. Buildings constructed of steel-reinforced concrete, on the other hand, perform much better because the embedded steel increases the ductility of the material.

How do you earthquake-proof a house?
------------------------------------

How To Make Your House Earthquake Resistant

1. Conduct a Home Inspection.
2. Keep the Foundation Moisture Constant.
3. Brace the Cripple walls with Plywood.
4. Avoid Unreinforced Masonry Walls.
5. Use Simpler reinforcement techniques.
6. Use Flexible-kind of Utilities.
7. Avoid Furniture, Fixtures and Decorations Near Bed.

What is the most earthquake resistant material?
-----------------------------------------------

Steel is much lighter than concrete, but it still brings a great deal of durability to construction projects. More flexible than concrete and other building materials, steel is more likely to bend instead of break when experiencing seismic force.

Can a building be designed to withstand an earthquake?
------------------------------------------------------

Buildings Can Be Designed to Withstand Earthquakes. Why Doesn’t the U.S. Build More of Them? When the shaking started at 5:46 a.m., Yasuhisa Itakura, an architect at a big Japanese construction company in Kobe, was sitting at his desk finishing a report he had toiled over all night.

What are the different types of rock to withstand an earthquake?
----------------------------------------------------------------

There are six different types of soil and rock types based on geotechnical parameters to withstand an earthquake: Type A (igneous rock), Type B (volcanic rock), Type C (sandstone) Type D (mud). Type E (artificial fill), Type F, soils requiring site-specific evaluations.

What kind of soil do you need for an earthquake?
------------------------------------------------

The soil should be stable and the area should not have a risk of landslides or rockslides. There are six different types of soil and rock types based on geotechnical parameters to withstand an earthquake: Type A (igneous rock), Type B (volcanic rock), Type C (sandstone) Type D (mud).

How does seismic engineering help prevent an earthquake?
--------------------------------------------------------

Seismic engineering cannot avoid and stop the perception of earthquake. But it can help in keeping the construction, rigid so that even if there is earthquake high on the Richter scale, the structure will not break or collapse down. The interior security should be safeguarded.
