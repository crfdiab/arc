What does the Big Bang fail to explain?
---------------------------------------

Although the standard big bang model can explain much about the evolution of the Universe, there are a few things it cannot explain: The Universe is clumpy. Astronomers, stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies and even larger structures are sprinkled about. We call this the structure problem.

What evidence is against the Big Bang?
--------------------------------------

Increasingly sensitive experiments on earth have failed to turn up any evidence of the dark matter particles that are firmly predicted by the Big Bang theory. But in addition, astronomical evidence as well has ruled out dark matter. The simplest evidence is in the relatively low velocities of galaxies in the universe.

Is the Big Bang theory correct?
-------------------------------

The Big Bang Theory is just that – a Theory. If it was unequivocally true, it would not be identified as a theory. As the other answer states, it is believed to be the best scientific explanation of how the universe came to be, but again, it is not unequivocally true.

What did the Big Bang destroy?
------------------------------

But the Big Bang wasn’t an explosion that destroyed things. It was the beginning of our universe, the start of both space and time. Rather than an explosion, it was a very rapid expansion, the event that started the universe growing bigger and bigger.

Are there any problems with the Big Bang theory?
------------------------------------------------

Yet another quirk unexplained by the Big Bang is the Flatness Problem. Almost all the evidence collected by cosmologists indicates that the Universe is flat. Like a sheet of paper on a desk, spacetime shows almost no curvature whatsoever. Within the context of the Big Bang, this seems extremely unlikely.

Who is the worst character in the Big Bang theory?
--------------------------------------------------

For all the success and love that The Big Bang Theory has enjoyed worldwide, a lot of people agree that Penny is one of the worst characters. She has plenty of fans, but she’s far from perfect. Here are 20 Things Wrong With Penny We All Choose To Ignore.

What is the Big Bang and why is it important?
---------------------------------------------

What Is the Big Bang? The Short Answer: The big bang is how astronomers explain the way the universe began. It is the idea that the universe began as just a single point, then expanded and stretched to grow as large as it is right now (and it could still be stretching).

Which is an unexplained quirk of the Big Bang?
----------------------------------------------

Yet another quirk unexplained by the Big Bang is the Flatness Problem. Almost all the evidence collected by cosmologists indicates that the Universe is flat. Like a sheet of paper on a desk, spacetime shows almost no curvature whatsoever. Within the context of the Big Bang, this seems extremely unlikely. Lastly,…
