Why do oceans have a relatively stable temperature?
---------------------------------------------------

Ocean temperatures remain fairly constant because water has a high specific heat. The specific heat of a substance refers to the amount of heat energy…

How do oceans stabilize temperature?
------------------------------------

The winds drive ocean circulation transporting warm water to the poles along the sea surface. As the water flows poleward, it releases heat into the atmosphere. Like a massive ‘flywheel’ that stabilizes the speed of an engine, the vast amounts of heat in the oceans stabilizes the temperature of Earth.

What is the temperature in the marine environment?
--------------------------------------------------

39 degrees Fahrenheit  
Marine biome experiences an average temperature of 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius). The ocean biome is naturally colder at the South Pole, but as you approach the equator, it becomes warmer because the sun rays strike the water surface directly.

Are ocean temperatures stable?
------------------------------

Global warming is making the oceans more stable, increasing surface temperatures and reducing the carbon they can absorb, according to research published Monday by climate scientists who warned that the findings have “profound and troubling” implications.

What is the temperature of ocean?
---------------------------------

The temperature range extends from 30 °C (86 °F) at the sea surface to −1 °C (30.2 °F) at the seabed. Like salinity, the temperature at depth is determined by the conditions that the water encountered when it was last at the surface. In the low latitudes the temperature change from top to bottom in the oceans is large.

What happens when the temperature of the ocean decreases?
---------------------------------------------------------

The Ocean &amp; Temperature ~ MarineBio Conservation Society If the temperature of water decreases its density increases, but only to a point. If the temperature of water decreases its density increases, but only to a point.

How are sea ice changes affecting marine mammals?
-------------------------------------------------

There also may be some indirect effect of sea ice changes on animal heath due to alterations in pathogen transmission, effect on animals on body condition caused by shift in the prey based/food web, changes in toxicant exposure associated with increased human habitation in the Arctic habitat.

Is the temperature of the environment a genetic factor?
-------------------------------------------------------

Environmental temperature is a non-genetic factor, the inclusion of which in our explanation is necessary if we are to account for the phenotypic phenomenon of interest. Ambient temperature by itself does not provide enough information about the prevailing climatic stress.

What is the operative temperature of the environment?
-----------------------------------------------------

Accordingly, for an ambient temperature of 30°C the operative temperature would be 35°C. There are several indices to assess the environmental heat load, which can easily be shown on commercially available devices.
