Why was there a crisis over Berlin in 1961?
-------------------------------------------

The Berlin Crisis started when the USSR launched an ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of all armed forces from Berlin, including the Western armed forces in West Berlin. The crisis culminated in the city’s de facto partition with the East German erection of the Berlin Wall.

What caused the Berlin Crisis?
------------------------------

Berlin blockade, international crisis that arose from an attempt by the Soviet Union, in 1948–49, to force the Western Allied powers (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) to abandon their post-World War II jurisdictions in West Berlin.

Why was Berlin a source of tension between the superpowers?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Hoping to force the Western powers out of Berlin, in June of 1948, the Soviet government threw up a blockade around Berlin, cutting the city off from all land traffic (road and rail lines, canals ) from the West. The United States saw the blockade as a threat to the freedom of Western Europe.

Why did the Berlin Crisis develop and what was its outcome?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Berlin crisis developed as a result of Kennedy’s failure to send US troops into Cuba during the Bay of Pigs incident to rescue the invaders. Instead, Khrushchev demanded that the US and its allies recognize Communist East Germany as an independent nation and also demanded that the US withdraw from West Berlin.

Why did the Paris summit in 1960 fail?
--------------------------------------

U-2 Incident, (1960), confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union that began with the shooting down of a U.S. U-2 reconnaissance plane over the Soviet Union and that caused the collapse of a summit conference in Paris between the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France.

How did the Berlin crisis of 1961 end?
--------------------------------------

The United States did not intervene because the Soviet Union was exercising control over its sector. When Khrushchev’s December 1961 deadline passed without incident, the conflict over the future of the city receded with no further Soviet agitation concerning a treaty.

Did the Berlin Wall increase tension?
-------------------------------------

Not only was the summit unsuccessful in its goal of building trust, but it also increased tensions between the two superpowers—particularly in discussions regarding the divided city of Berlin. During the summit, Khrushchev threatened to cut off Allied access to West Berlin.

What was the outcome of the Berlin crisis?
------------------------------------------

After the blockade was lifted in 1949, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union maintained the status quo in Berlin, whereby each of the former World War II allies governed its own sector and had free access to all other sectors.

What did East Germany do in the Berlin Crisis of 1961?
------------------------------------------------------

On the night of 13-14 August 1961, East German police and military units sealed off all arteries leading to West Berlin. The communists pulled up train tracks and roads, erected barriers topped with barbed wire, completely isolating the Western sectors and preventing East Germans from escaping to the West.

Why did the US not intervene in the Berlin Crisis?
--------------------------------------------------

Berlin divided. On the night of August 12–13, 1961, the East German government, backed by the Soviet Union, began to build a barrier between East Berlin (the Soviet-occupied sector) and West Berlin. The United States did not intervene because the Soviet Union was exercising control over its sector.

Who was the Soviet premier during the Berlin Crisis?
----------------------------------------------------

On November 10, 1958, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev delivered a speech in which he demanded that the Western powers of the United States, Great Britain and France pull their forces out of West Berlin within six months.

Why was Khrushchev interested in the Berlin Crisis?
---------------------------------------------------

Khrushchev had been equally uninterested in risking a battle over Berlin. In return for Kennedy’s assurance that the west had no designs on East Berlin, the Soviet leader tacitly recognised that allied officials and military personnel would have unimpeded access to the East German capital.
