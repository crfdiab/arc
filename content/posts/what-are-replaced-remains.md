What are replaced remains?
--------------------------

These crystallized minerals cause the remains to harden along with the encasing sedimentary rock. In another fossilization process, called replacement, the minerals in groundwater replace the minerals that make up the bodily remains after the water completely dissolves the original hard parts of the organism.

What are fossils replaced with?
-------------------------------

Replacement occurs when the original shell or bone dissolves away and is replaced by a different mineral; when this occurs with permineralization, it is called petrification. In compression, the most common form of fossilization of leaves and ferns, a dark imprint of the fossil remains.

What are examples of original remains?
--------------------------------------

Examples include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, objects preserved in amber, hair, petrified wood, oil, coal, and DNA remnants.

What is an example of preserved remains?
----------------------------------------

Examples include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, objects preserved in amber, hair, petrified wood, oil, coal, and DNA remnants. The totality of fossils is known as the fossil record.

What are three original remains examples?
-----------------------------------------

The remains of an ancient organism. Examples include shells, bones, teeth, and leaves. A structure that forms when sediments fill a mold and harden, forming a replica of the original structure. Any remains or trace of an ancient organism.

What are the three types of preserved remains?
----------------------------------------------

Fossils are preserved by three main methods: unaltered soft or hard parts, altered hard parts, and trace fossils.

What is a original remain?
--------------------------

Traces or remains of living things from long ago. Original Remains. Fossils that are actual bodies or parts of organisms.

What are original remains?
--------------------------

Original Remains. Fossils that are actual bodies or parts of organisms. Carbon Film. An image in carbon left behind by a dead organism.

Why are original preservations so rare?
---------------------------------------

If an organism is incredibly lucky, it may be preserved like this baby mammoth found a few years ago or perhaps the organism will be encased in amber. Fossils are rare because most remains are consumed or destroyed soon after death. Even if bones are buried, they then must remain buried and be replaced with minerals.
