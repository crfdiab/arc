Was the Grand Canyon an ocean before?
-------------------------------------

An ocean started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550 million years ago. As its shoreline moved east, the ocean began to concurrently deposit the three formations of the Tonto Group.

What landform was the Grand Canyon before it became a canyon?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Colorado Plateau  
Uplift of the Colorado Plateau was a key step in the eventual formation of Grand Canyon. The action of plate tectonics lifted the rocks high and flat, creating a plateau through which the Colorado River could cut down.

What was the Grand Canyon weathered by?
---------------------------------------

Colorado River  
The Canyon itself was carved by the Colorado River and the wind that caused the surface of the sedimentary rocks to become exposed and erode over time. The erosion of the Grand Canyon by winds, rains and the amazing strength of the Colorado River created the marvelous views and exposed magnificent caves.

When did people first come to the Grand Canyon?
-----------------------------------------------

Scientists estimate the canyon may have formed 5 to 6 million years ago when the Colorado River began to cut a channel through layers of rock. Humans have inhabited the area in and around the canyon since the last Ice Age. The first Europeans to reach the Grand Canyon were Spanish explorers in the 1540s.

How are rock layers formed in the Grand Canyon?
-----------------------------------------------

To look at rock layers, geologists use a diagram called a stratigraphic column. It shows the rock layers with the oldest on the bottom, and the youngest on the top. That means that the bottom layer was formed first, and every subsequent layer was formed later, with the youngest rocks on the top.

Where are the oldest rocks in the Grand Canyon?
-----------------------------------------------

The oldest known rocks in the canyon, called the Vishnu Basement Rocks, can be found near the bottom of the Inner Gorge. The Vishnu rocks formed about 1.7 billion years ago when magma hardened and joined this region—once a volcanic ocean chain—to the North American continent.

Which is older the Grand Canyon or the Colorado River?
------------------------------------------------------

Scientists know that the Colorado River carved Grand Canyon. The river is thus slightly older than the canyon, though the two are certainly close in age. Scientists have studied rock deposits along course of the present day Colorado River.
