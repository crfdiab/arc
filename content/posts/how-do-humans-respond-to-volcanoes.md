How do humans respond to volcanoes?
-----------------------------------

IF YOU ARE UNDER A VOLCANO WARNING: Listen for emergency information and alerts. Follow evacuation or shelter orders. If advised to evacuate, then do so early. Avoid areas downstream of the eruption.

Does volcanic eruption help human beings?
-----------------------------------------

Over geologic time, volcanic eruptions and related processes have directly and indirectly benefited mankind: Volcanic materials ultimately break down and weather to form some of the most fertile soils on Earth, cultivation of which has produced abundant food and fostered civilizations.

How are people affected when a volcano erupts?
----------------------------------------------

Nonetheless, millions of Americans live, work or vacation in places that could be affected by volcanic activity. An erupting volcano can blast ash, lava, solid rocks and gases into the air, creating hazards that can kill people, disrupt air travel and destroy property many miles away.

How does the ash from a volcano affect people?
----------------------------------------------

Volcanic ash can travel hundreds to thousands of miles downwind from a volcano. Fresh volcanic ash is gritty, abrasive, sometimes corrosive, and always unpleasant. Although ash is not highly toxic, it can trouble infants, the elderly, and those with respiratory ailments. Ash can also get in your eyes and scratch them, especially when itâ€™s windy.

How does community response to volcanic crises work?
----------------------------------------------------

Consequently, improving the capacity of communities in hazard zones not only reduces the risk of disaster, but also enables wise use of volcanic resources during dormant periods.

How are climate and humans respond to past volcanic anomalies?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Significant discrepancies, however, remain between the postvolcanic climate anomalies reconstructed from proxies and those simulated by climate models. These discrepancies likely relate to uncertainties in volcanic forcing reconstructions, proxy biases, and model representations of physical processes.
