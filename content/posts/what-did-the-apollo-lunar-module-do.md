What did the Apollo lunar module do?
------------------------------------

The Lunar Module (LM) was used for descent to the lunar surface and served as a base while the astronauts were on the Moon. A separate ascent stage, comprising the top portion of the Lunar Module, lifted the astronauts from the Moon’s surface to rendezvous and dock with the command module, orbiting the Moon.

What was the lunar module made of?
----------------------------------

What material was the lunar module made of?/how did it stay pressurized? chem milled aluminum. It was thicker than aluminum foil but thin enough to be punctured by a dropped tool on the ground. It was protected from micrometeorites by layered mylar film installed on standoffs all around the exterior.
