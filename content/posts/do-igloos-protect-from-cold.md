Is it cold to sleep in an igloo?
--------------------------------

Very cold. And after a long day of pushing powder around the slopes, sleeping in an igloo is a far cry from the rejuvenating sauna in the four-star hotel down the road. After running around in subzero temperatures all day, the exhausted sleep in the plenty-warm igloo bed is not only welcome, it’s comfortable.

Who lives in igloo house?
-------------------------

Greenland Inuit  
Igloo, also spelled iglu, also called aputiak, temporary winter home or hunting-ground dwelling of Canadian and Greenland Inuit (Eskimos). The term igloo, or iglu, from Eskimo igdlu (“house”), is related to Iglulik, a town, and Iglulirmiut, an Inuit people, both on an island of the same name.

How do they keep warm in an igloo?
----------------------------------

It’s an insulation thing. Igloos are built from compressed snow. While it looks solid, as much as 95% of snow is actually air trapped inside tiny crystals. Because the air can’t circulate very well inside the ice crystals, the heat gets trapped in there.

Where do people who live in igloos come from?
---------------------------------------------

Igloos are often associated with the Eskimo or Inuit community. They are built as temporary houses or camping stations for hunters living in areas of extreme cold, such as the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada, the United States and Russia. Are igloos warm inside?

-------------------------------------------

They are built as temporary houses or camping stations for hunters living in areas of extreme cold, such as the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada, the United States and Russia. Are igloos warm inside? Despite being made from snow, igloos are able to keep its inhabitants warm due to many properties.

Why is the inside of an igloo always cold?
------------------------------------------

First you need to understand that snow is an outstanding insulator. So, notwithstanding the fact that the snow is cold, the wall of an igloo is very effective at trapping heat inside the igloo. Plus, the snow walls are really very good at sealing out the wind, so the interior of an igloo is very still.

What’s the difference between an igloo and a snowhouse?
-------------------------------------------------------

An exception to this is the dialect used in the Igloolik region. Iglu is used for other buildings, while igluvijaq, (plural igluvijait, Inuktitut syllabics: ᐃᒡᓗᕕᔭᖅ) is specifically used for a snowhouse. Outside Inuit culture, however, igloo refers exclusively to shelters constructed from blocks of compacted snow, generally in the form of a dome.
