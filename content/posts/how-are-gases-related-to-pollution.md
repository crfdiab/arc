How are gases related to pollution?
-----------------------------------

“Burning fossil fuels releases gases and chemicals into the air.” And in an especially destructive feedback loop, air pollution not only contributes to climate change but is also exacerbated by it. “Air pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and methane raises the earth’s temperature,” Walke says.

Does Gas affect air pollution?
------------------------------

Air pollution can also cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Long-term health effects from air pollution include heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Air pollution can also cause long-term damage to people’s nerves, brain, kidneys, liver, and other organs.

What are the properties of pollution?
-------------------------------------

Polluted air may contain particulate matter (such as black soot) and many different gaseous chemicals such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, ozone, nitrates, sulphates, organic hydrocarbons and many others.

What are the effects of air pollution on humans?
------------------------------------------------

Breathing in this air can lead to a multitude of health complications. The most common pollutants are smoke, soot, pollen, methane, and carbon dioxide. But this is not the only thing we should be worried about. Poor air quality can harm all lifeforms, including both plants and animals.

How are air pollutants released into the atmosphere?
----------------------------------------------------

There are a number of air pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. 1. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide: Carbon oxides are one of the largest groups of pollutants, causing widespread global harm. These harmful gases are emitted from vehicles, industrial furnaces and other engines.

What are the most common pollutants in the air?
-----------------------------------------------

The most common pollutants are smoke, soot, pollen, methane, and carbon dioxide. But this is not the only thing we should be worried about. Poor air quality can harm all lifeforms, including both plants and animals. The bigger culprit for this air pollution is human interference.

Which is the most harmful gas in the air?
-----------------------------------------

Carbon oxides are one of the largest groups of pollutants, causing widespread global harm. These harmful gases are emitted from vehicles, industrial furnaces and other engines. When fossil fuels are not burnt properly, they result in emission of carbon monoxide, a colourless and odourless poisonous gas.
