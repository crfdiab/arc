How did Mendeleev first arranged the elements?
----------------------------------------------

He realised that the physical and chemical properties of elements were related to their atomic mass in a repeating or ‘periodic’ way, and arranged them so that groups of elements with similar properties fell into vertical columns in his table.

When Mendeleev arranged the elements in order of increasing?
------------------------------------------------------------

Elements of the periodic table are arranged in order of increasing atomic number. The periodic law states “When elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, there is a periodic repetition of their chemical and physical properties.”

How was the first table of elements arranged?
---------------------------------------------

An ordered vision. Mendeleev’s periodic table, published in 1869, was a vertical chart that organized 63 known elements by atomic weight. This arrangement placed elements with similar properties into horizontal rows.

Who arranged the first periodic table?
--------------------------------------

 Dmitri Mendeleev  
Albert Ghiorso  
Periodic table/Inventors

Why is the modern periodic table is arranged in order of increasing?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Atomic number and protons The atomic number of an element was originally just its position on the periodic table. After the discovery of protons , scientists realised that the atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in its nucleus . rows, called periods , in order of increasing atomic number.

Who is father of periodic table?
--------------------------------

What determines the order of the modern periodic table?
-------------------------------------------------------

atomic numbers  
The elements in the modern periodic table are arranged in order of their atomic numbers, which is the number of protons in the nuclei of the atoms of an element. Each element has a unique atomic number. The atomic numbers are also whole numbers.

When did Mendeleev publish his first periodic table?
----------------------------------------------------

Mendeleev published his first periodic table of the elements in 1869. Features of Mendeleev’s tables Mendeleev arranged the elements in order of increasing relative atomic mass. When he did this he noted that the chemical properties of the elements and their compounds showed a periodic trend.

Who was the first chemist to create the periodic table?
-------------------------------------------------------

This was the first iteration of the periodic law. Russian chemist and educator Dmitrii Mendeleev is best known today for his creation of the periodic table of elements. Mendeleev was far from the first chemist to attempt to organize the elements by atomic weight or to recognize that characteristics recurred on some sort of regular basis.

How are elements organized on the periodic table?
-------------------------------------------------

Rather than atomic weight, atomic number—the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom—determined the characteristics of an element. Rather miraculously, organizing the elements by their atomic number rather than their atomic weight did not change the arrangement of the periodic table.

How did Dmitri Mendeleev contribute to chemical theory?
-------------------------------------------------------

Gradually the periodic law and table became the framework for a great part of chemical theory. By the time Mendeleev died in 1907, he enjoyed international recognition and had received distinctions and awards from many countries.
