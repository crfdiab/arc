Do space launches damage the atmosphere?
----------------------------------------

“A rocket is very high energy, very high temperature and so it emits things like nitrogen oxides which once released directly into the stratosphere can contribute to depleting ozone,” says Marais.

How does space exploration impact the environment?
--------------------------------------------------

Human activities have contributed to deforestation, desertification, soil degradation, depletion of the ozone layer and climate change. Space-based technologies, such as remotely sensed data, have enhanced scientific understanding of water cycles, air quality, forests and other aspects of the natural environment.

Do rockets destroy the ozone layer?
-----------------------------------

When solid-fuel rockets launch, they release chlorine gas directly into the stratosphere, where the chlorine reacts with oxygen to form ozone-destroying chlorine oxides. Soot and aluminum oxide in rocket oxide depletes upper-atmosphere ozone, which shields the Earth’s surface from damaging ultraviolet rays.

Do rockets destroy ozone layer?

How are rocket launches bad for the environment?
------------------------------------------------

Many rockets are, however, propelled by liquid hydrogen fuel, which produces ‘clean’ water vapour exhaust, although the production of hydrogen itself can cause significant carbon emissions. Rocket engines release trace gases into the upper atmosphere that contribute to ozone depletion, as well as particles of soot.

What kind of air pollution is produced by rockets?
--------------------------------------------------

The issue of rocket emissions—which deliver gases and particles directly into the middle and upper atmosphere—will be included in a forthcoming United Nations 2018 Quadrennial Global Ozone Assessment that delves into the substances responsible for ozone depletion.

Why is it important to study rocket emissions?
----------------------------------------------

These plumes are filled with materials that can collect in the air over time, potentially altering the atmosphere in dangerous ways. It’s a phenomenon that’s not well-understood, and some scientists say we need to start studying these emissions now before the number of rocket launches increases significantly.

Is it true that space launches cause pollution?
-----------------------------------------------

There has been a lot of buzz recently about spaceflight companies shooting for frequent ” airline-like operations ,” but scientists, engineers and policy makers generally are not “putting two and two together with respect to the emissions that are implied by that idea,” Ross said.
