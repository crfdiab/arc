What problems do dams and reservoirs cause?
-------------------------------------------

Reservoirs are created to provide a benefit to people. However, the flooding, or inundation, of land and the management of the reservoir water can have an unfavourable effect on people, the wildlife and the environment, not only in and around the valley, but also downstream of the dam.

What are the effects of reservoirs?
-----------------------------------

Reservoirs may greatly affect fish production and disrupt the life cycles of fish, and affect water quality, wildlife and biodiversity. On a global scale, dams and reservoirs are altering biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients that affect our climate and the health of oceans.

Is it bad to live near a reservoir?
-----------------------------------

Proximity to reservoirs, wetlands, and dams can have both positive and negative impacts on house prices. Also, there can be a higher risk of flooding near dams, reservoirs, and wetlands, which can be capitalized into house prices and lead to lower property values.

What are environmental effects of constructing dams?
----------------------------------------------------

Greenhouse gases: The flooding of surrounding habitat around dams kills trees and other plant life that then decomposes and releases large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Because the river is no longer flowing freely, the water becomes stagnant and the bottom of the reservoir becomes becomes depleted of oxygen.

How are dam useful to us?
-------------------------

Dams are important because they provide water for domestic, industry and irrigation purposes. Dams often also provide hydroelectric power production and river navigation. Dams and their reservoirs provide recreation areas for fishing and boating. They help people by reducing or preventing floods.

What is the environmental impact of dams and reservoirs?
--------------------------------------------------------

However, dams and their reservoirs have been linked to global warming. Studies have shown that flooding in dams submerges existing vegetation which over time decays and produces methane gas which is classified to be among the most detrimental greenhouse gasses.

What are the disadvantages of a new dam?
----------------------------------------

The disadvantages of creating a new reservoir should be considered during the planning stages. Suitable methods should be decided upon to eliminate or reduce the disadvantages, so that the reservoir provides an overall benefit to people.

How are dammed rivers bad for the environment?
----------------------------------------------

Because a dammed river no longer flows freely, the sediment that would have otherwise been deposited naturally downstream begins to build up behind the dam, forming new riverbanks, river deltas, alluvial fans, braided rivers, oxbow lakes, levees and coastal shores.

How does a dam change the flow of a river?
------------------------------------------

Upstream of the dam, the river is flooded and becomes a reservoir. The nature of the river flow downstream is changed. The dam can hold back sediment that normally finds its way downstream. When the river valley is inundated with water, animals are forced to leave the area and plants and trees are killed.
