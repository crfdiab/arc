Arizona is not a major oil and gas producing state. Most production stems from small oil fields in northeastern Arizona. AZGS Circular 29, ‘Arizona has oil and gas potential’, by Steve Rauzi (AZGS, retired) is an excellent starting point for learning about the states oil and gas resources.

How are natural resources used in the state of Arizona?
-------------------------------------------------------

The other main use of natural resources in Arizona is agriculture. While the state produces many types of crops, the biggest one is cotton. Due to the combination of the state’s fertile soil and lots of sunshine, Arizona is able to produce great quantities of cotton.

Where does oil and natural gas come from?
-----------------------------------------

Oil, natural gas, and coal are fossil fuels that form as a result of anaerobic decomposition of buried organisms. Fossil fuel deposits typically formed millions to tens or hundreds of millions of years before the present. Arizona is not a major oil and gas producing state. Most production stems from small oil fields in northeastern Arizona.
