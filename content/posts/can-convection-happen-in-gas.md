Can convection happen in gas?
-----------------------------

Convection only happens with liquids and gases.

What are convection currents in gas?
------------------------------------

Convection currents are flowing fluid that is moving because there is a temperature or density difference within the material. Because particles within a solid are fixed in place, convection currents are seen only in gases and liquids.

Where does convection occur?
----------------------------

Convection occurs on a large scale in atmospheres, oceans, planetary mantles, and it provides the mechanism of heat transfer for a large fraction of the outermost interiors of our sun and all stars. Fluid movement during convection may be invisibly slow, or it may be obvious and rapid, as in a hurricane.

Is convection liquid to gas?
----------------------------

Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (liquid or gas) between areas of different temperature.

What causes convection?
-----------------------

Convection currents are the result of differential heating. Lighter (less dense), warm material rises while heavier (more dense) cool material sinks. It is this movement that creates circulation patterns known as convection currents in the atmosphere, in water, and in the mantle of Earth.

What does convection only occur in?
-----------------------------------

This way the heat transfer within the matter takes place. So convection can occur only in the matter which is capable of showing motion. We know that the solids cannot show any kind of motion. So convection cannot occur in solids.

What is a convection current example?
-------------------------------------

Convection currents are present in the air– A good example of convection current is the warm air that rises towards the ceiling in your house. The process happens as the warm air is said to be less dense than that of the colder air. Another good example of convection current is wind.

What are the three main sources of convection?
----------------------------------------------

The primary sources of thermal energy for mantle convection are three: (1) internal heating due to the decay of the radioactive isotopes of uranium, thorium, and potassium; (2) the long-term secular cooling of the earth; and (3) heat from the core.

What are two factors that cause convection?
-------------------------------------------

Three factors contribute to set convection currents in motion:

- heating and cooling of the fluid,
- changes in the fluid’s density, and.
- force of gravity.
- The heat source for these currents is heat from Earth’s core and from the mantle itself.
- Hot columns of mantle material rise slowly.

What are some examples of convection?
-------------------------------------

Everyday Examples of Convection radiator – A radiator puts warm air out at the top and draws in cooler air at the bottom. steaming cup of hot tea – The steam you see when drinking a cup of hot tea indicates that heat is being transferred into the air. ice melting – Ice melts because heat moves to the ice from the air.

Why does convection occur in liquids and gases?
-----------------------------------------------

Liquids and gases are fluids because they can be made to flow. The particles in these fluids can move from place to place. Convection occurs when particles with a lot of heat energy in a liquid or gas move and take the place of particles with less heat energy. Heat energy is transferred from hot places to cooler places by convection.

How does heat transfer occur due to convection?
-----------------------------------------------

Heat transfer by convection either occurs due to thermal diffusion (motion of fluid molecule) or advection, in which heat is transferred by the bulk motion of heat currents in the fluid. Under normal conditions, the heat transfer due to convection is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the parts.

What do you need to know about convection?
------------------------------------------

What is Convection? 1 Convection is the process of heat transfer in fluids by the actual motion of matter. 2 It happens in liquids and gases. 3 It may be natural or forced. 4 It involves a bulk transfer of portions of the fluid.

How is heat transferred from a liquid to a gas?
-----------------------------------------------

Convection occurs when particles with a lot of heat energy in a liquid or gas move and take the place of particles with less heat energy. Heat energy is transferred from hot places to cooler places by convection. Liquids and gases expand when they are heated.
