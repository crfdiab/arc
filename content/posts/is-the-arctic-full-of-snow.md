Is the Arctic full of snow?
---------------------------

Climate. The Arctic is characterized by cold winters and cool summers. Its precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow and is low, with most of the area receiving less than 50 cm (20 in). Perhaps the most alarming result of this is Arctic sea ice shrinkage.

Is the Arctic ocean all ice?
----------------------------

The Arctic Ocean is Earth’s northernmost body of water. It encircles the Arctic, and flows beneath it. Most of the Arctic Ocean is covered by ice throughout the year—although that is starting to change as temperatures climb.

Is the Arctic ocean frozen in winter?
-------------------------------------

Arctic sea ice has most likely frozen to its maximum extent for the winter. Arctic sea ice grows each winter, hitting its annual maximum sometime in March. When the sun returns to the Arctic in the spring, the air warms up and the ice starts to melt.

How deep is the snow in Arctic?
-------------------------------

The average snow depth of the multiyear ice region reaches a maximum of 34 cm (11 g cm 2) in May. The deepest snow is just north of Greenland and Ellesmere Island, peaking in early June at more than 40 cm, when the snow is already melting north of Siberia and Alaska.

How cold does the sea need to be to freeze?
-------------------------------------------

about 28.4 degrees Fahrenheit  
At least 15 percent of the ocean is covered by sea ice some part of the year. Ocean water freezes just like freshwater, but at lower temperatures. Fresh water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit but seawater freezes at about 28.4 degrees Fahrenheit , because of the salt in it.

How does sea ice affect the Arctic Ocean?
-----------------------------------------

Over the Arctic Ocean, sea ice absorbs the impacts of waves and limits shoreline wave erosion. As sea ice retreats farther away from surrounding landmasses, late-summer and autumn storms stir up strong waves that crash onto shore.

Is there snow in the Arctic every year?
---------------------------------------

Yes, there is snow. The Arctic is a desert, so there is very little snow every year. In the winter of 1990, I was in Greenland on or above the Circle planning the warm weather evacuation of the DEW Line sites. 4 of them across Greenland. Distant / Defense Early Warning sites built and resupplied…

How are Arctic sea ice and permafrost related?
----------------------------------------------

NSIDC scientist Twila Moon points out that changes in Arctic sea ice, land ice, and permafrost are often treated as unrelated issues when in fact they affect each other and the rest of the planet.

When did the Arctic sea ice start melting?
------------------------------------------

Satellite data have documented continued declines; since continuous satellite-based measurements began in November 1978, data show a trend of more ice melting away during summers and less new ice forming during winters. Overall, less sea ice survives in the Arctic.
