What was life like for the Inuit?
---------------------------------

For generations the Inuit people of Nunavut lived a traditional life in the Arctic, moving from one place to another with the seasons, to hunt caribou, muskox and seal, or fish for char and whitefish. Inuit did not wander aimlessly in search of meat and fish.

What was the Inuit social life?
-------------------------------

Family groups were the most important social unit in Inuit culture. They usually lived in family groups of around 5-6 people. Then each family would live and hunt together with 6-10 other families. Marriage was important for the Inuit people.

What were the Inuits traditions?
--------------------------------

During the singing and dancing, Inuit people told stories of the spirits. There were dances of different nature. Some were religious, others were for welcoming travelers or celebrating a hunt. In terms of religious rituals, Shamans performed healing rituals in ceremonial houses called Kashims.

How did the First Nations make fire?
------------------------------------

The \[Inuit\] prized willow catkins; the Indians of the N. W. coast used frayed cedar bark; other tribes used fungi, softened bark, grass, or other ignitible \[sic\] material. Touchwood or punk for preserving fire was obtained from decayed trees, or some form of slow match was prepared from bark.

Did the Inuit use wood?
-----------------------

The Inuit were traditionally nomadic and would cut shrubs wherever they happened to be camping during the hunting season. Wood gathering around the camps appears to have been the job of women, who used knives (ulu) to cut branches from shrubs. Elders identified some preferred locations for wood gathering.

What did the Inuit people do for a living?
------------------------------------------

Some early North American settlers made their home in the far frozen north of North America. These people are called the Inuit (sometimes known in the past as Eskimos). From early times, the Inuit adapted their way of life to the frozen land and sea of the Arctic. There they hunted for caribou (reindeer), seals, birds, and fish.

What kind of religion did the Inuit have?
-----------------------------------------

Animism is the belief that both living and non-living things have a spirit. Several of the Inuit I spoke said that many people believed in both Animism, the belief that all living and non-living things have a spirit, and Christianity which was introduced into the Canadian Arctic towards the end of the 1950s.

What kind of animals did the Inuit eat?
---------------------------------------

In particular, reindeer, musk ox, Arctic hare, walrus, polar bear, seal, whale, ptarmigan, geese, ducks, and other birds are the typical diet of Inuit. Igloos were used as a temporary shelter on extended winter hunting trips, not as a permanent Inuit home.

What kind of boats did the Inuit use?
-------------------------------------

Another key part of Inuit life was the kayak, which means “hunters boat.” In addition to its use for hunting, the Inuit kayak also served as a means of transportation. It was propelled by a double-bladed paddle and was usually made of driftwood or whalebone to ensure a light frame.
