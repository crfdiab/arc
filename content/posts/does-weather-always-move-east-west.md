Does weather always move east west?
-----------------------------------

MEMPHIS, TN (WMC) – In the United States, most of our weather moves from west to east but in actuality systems can move in any direction. Jet streams carry weather systems. Warmer tropical air blows toward the colder northern air. These winds shift west to east due to the rotation of the earth.

Do storms always travel west to east?
-------------------------------------

Myth: Thunderstorms and tornadoes always move from west to east. how and where storms will move, and it can be in any direction. Tornadoes have been known to act erratic, and can change directions and speed very quickly. Never try to outrun a tornado in a vehicle.

Do all clouds move from west to east?
-------------------------------------

If you live in North America, you may notice that for the most part, clouds move from west to east because of the jet stream. This is the same reason why it typically takes longer to fly from the East Coast to the West Coast than it does to fly in the other direction – you’re essentially flying against the wind.

Does rain ever come from the east?
----------------------------------

For use, rain and storms come from the south east. Clear fine weather comes from the northwest, or at least that is the wind direction.

Does rain always come from the west?
------------------------------------

It is important to note that precipitation generally moves from west to east in the Northern Hemisphere. This is generally due to lower air pressure further north (ex. Since low pressure systems spin in a counterclockwise fashion, winds move from the west to the east, propelling weather systems to the east.

Why do jetstreams form?
-----------------------

Jet streams form when warm air masses meet cold air masses in the atmosphere. So when Earth’s warmer air masses meet cooler air masses, the warmer air rises up higher in the atmosphere while cooler air sinks down to replace the warm air.

What direction do storms travel?
--------------------------------

In the United States, the wind above our head tends to move in a direction from west to east. These act to steer our storms and move them across the country. As areas of low pressure form, they interact with the jet stream which ultimately pushes them on through.

Do clouds actually move?
------------------------

Clouds move because the wind is carrying the parcel of cloudy air along. Some clouds, like the lenticular clouds that form over hills, are stationary even when the wind is strong. (Actually we get fooled into thinking nothing is moving.

Where did all the rain come from?
---------------------------------

What causes rain? Clouds are made of water droplets. Within a cloud, water droplets condense onto one another, causing the droplets to grow. When these water droplets get too heavy to stay suspended in the cloud, they fall to Earth as rain.

Does rain come from space?
--------------------------

As we leave Earth’s atmosphere and enter space, well, it’s pretty empty, with no air or atmosphere for clouds to form in and no water to form the clouds, and so, no rain.

Where does the weather move from west to East?
----------------------------------------------

The main thing to remember is that the weather moves from west to east only in the part of the world where you happen to be, namely the temperate latitudes. In both tropical and polar regions the prevailing winds move in the opposite direction, from east to west.

Where does most of the rain fall in the United States?
------------------------------------------------------

The characteristics of United States rainfall climatology differ significantly across the United States and those under United States sovereignty. Late summer and fall extratropical cyclones bring a majority of the precipitation which falls across western, southern, and southeast Alaska annually.

Where are the winds coming from today in the northeast?
-------------------------------------------------------

Today, the northeastern seaboard is seeing winds from the east. Winds are strong across the plains, but are definitely not moving west to east. The winds in the plains are blowing strongly from the north in some places, strongly from the south in others. There’s a line separating the northerly winds from the southerly winds.

How does the Earth’s rotation affect the direction of the jet stream?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

How the earth’s rotation the effects the west to east direction of the jet stream. Jet streams are relatively narrow bands of strong wind in the upper levels of the atmosphere. The winds blow from west to east in jet streams but the flow often shifts to the north and south.
