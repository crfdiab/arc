What can lessen the erosion of a hillside?
------------------------------------------

What Is Done to Reduce Soil Erosion on Steep Slopes?

- Planting and Watering. Improved planting and watering practices reduce soil erosion on steep slopes.
- Controling Soil. Heavy rain washes away bare soil on steep slopes, but soil amendments and mulches reduce soil loss.
- Growing Ground Cover Plants.
- Building Terraces. What causes hillside erosion?
    -----------------------------
    
    Erosion is basically the displacement of soil from one area to another. On steep slopes and embankments erosion is caused primarily by water, especially by heavy rainfall. Rain that falls onto the exposed ground dislodges soil particles which are then carried away down the slope by the flowing water.
    
    What type of soil is least likely to erode?
    -------------------------------------------
    
    Soils containing a large amount of silt-sized particles are most susceptible to erosion from moving water whereas soils consisting of clay or sand-sized particles are less susceptible to erosion from moving water.
    
    How do you shore up a hillside?
    -------------------------------
    
    Below are a few ideas for hill stabilization.
    
    
    1. Roots and Shoots. There are many ways to shore up a hillside to prevent soil erosion.
    2. Watering on a Hillside. Water whisks quickly off a hillside leaving plants dry.
    3. Stairs, Paths, and Rocks.
    4. Dry Creek Beds.
    5. Middle Ground.
    
    What is the most easily eroded soil?
    ------------------------------------
    
    Soils most susceptible to erosion are those with the largest amount of medium (silt)-size particles. Clay and sandy soils are less prone to erosion.
    
    Which soil is the most resistant to erosion by water?
    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    Clay  
    Clay-rich soils resist erosion well because of strong cohesive forces between particles and the gluelike characteristics of humus.
    
    What are the effects of erosion on a hill?
    ------------------------------------------
    
    If residential properties sitting on a hillside or slope don’t take steps to protect their soil from erosion, the effects will resound throughout their neighborhood: A loss of nutrients that run off after a rainstorm; An increase in flooding because of clogged waterways; A degradation in local air quality because of exposed soils
    
    Is there a way to stop erosion on a hillside?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    There are a few ways to stop hillside erosion. Some are low-tech, some are high-tech — and the method you choose depends on the quality of your property. Not all slopes and hillsides are created alike. The topography of the land surrounding your home or building determines which method you’ll use to stop erosion.
    
    What to do about erosion on a slope?
    ------------------------------------
    
    The incline: If your slope is less than 33%, you can use mulch to keep your soil secure and cover up topsoil from degradation. Anything greater and you’ll need to consider how accessible your slope is and how much planting you can do. Soil make-up: Is the topsoil on your property thin and sit on top of mostly rock?
    
    How can you maintain the quality of soil on a hillside?
    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    Stability is the key to maintaining the quality of soil on a hillside. The greater the level of stability, the less the chance for erosion and run-off. So while you can’t change natural flow patterns, you can use strategic solutions to work with nature.
