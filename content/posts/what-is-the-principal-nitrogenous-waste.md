What is the principal nitrogenous waste?
----------------------------------------

Nitrogenous Waste in Terrestrial Animals: The Urea Cycle Mammals, including humans, are the primary producers of urea. Because they secrete urea as the primary nitrogenous waste product, they are called ureotelic animals. Urea serves an important role in the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds by animals.

What is the waste product of protozoa?
--------------------------------------

Excretion in Protozoa: Waste products are water, carbon dioxide and nitrogenous compounds and remain in soluble forms. Waste materials are passed out of the body by diffusion or by the contractile vacuoles.

What is the nitrogenous waste of shark?
---------------------------------------

urea  
Sharks, which belong to the marine subclass of elasmobranchs, are among the exceptions to this rule, along with skates and rays. “These animals are ureotelic, producing urea, which is a much less toxic molecule, as their major nitrogenous waste,” the researchers wrote in their study.

What is the most common nitrogenous waste?
------------------------------------------

Urea  
Urea and uric acid are the most common nitrogenous waste products in terrestrial animals; freshwater fish excrete ammonia and marine fish excrete both urea and trimethylamine oxide.

Where does urea produce?
------------------------

liver  
Urea is produced in the liver and is a metabolite (breakdown product) of amino acids. Ammonium ions are formed in the breakdown of amino acids. Some are used in the biosynthesis of nitrogen compounds. Excess ammonium ions are converted to urea.

Do sharks poop?
---------------

Conclusion. Sharks do take a poop. Of course, they eat like every living thing and they will always find a way to excrete their waste.

Where does excretion of nitrogen occur in protozoa?
---------------------------------------------------

These substances are consid­ered as catabolic products. The way they are extruded is still in observation stage. In most protozoa, excretion of nitrogen occurs in the form of Ammonia and free amnio acid. The reaction to stimulus in protozoa is expressed by movements.

Which is the most toxic form of nitrogenous waste?
--------------------------------------------------

Forms of Nitrogenous Waste. The next form of nitrogenous waste is urea, a nitrogenous waste molecule with two nitrogen atoms. Urea is less toxic than ammonia, so it can stay in the body a little longer and takes less water to flush out. But, it also requires more energy to produce. The third major form of nitrogenous waste is uric acid,…

How are nitrogenous wastes produced in birds and reptiles?
----------------------------------------------------------

Nitrogenous Waste in Birds and Reptiles: Uric Acid. Mammals also form some uric acid during breakdown of nucleic acids. Uric acid is a compound similar to purines found in nucleic acids. It is water insoluble and tends to form a white paste or powder; it is excreted by birds, insects, and reptiles.

How does an organism get rid of nitrogenous wastes?
---------------------------------------------------

Terrestrial organisms have evolved other mechanisms to excrete nitrogenous wastes. The animals must detoxify ammonia by converting it into a relatively nontoxic form such as urea or uric acid. Mammals, including humans, produce urea, whereas reptiles and many terrestrial invertebrates produce uric acid.
