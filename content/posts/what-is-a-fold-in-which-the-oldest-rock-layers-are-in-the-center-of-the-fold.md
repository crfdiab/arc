What is a fold in which the oldest rock layers are in the center of the fold?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anticlines  
Anticlines and synclines are the most common up-and-down folds that result from compression. An anticline has a ∩-shape, with the oldest rocks in the center of the fold. A syncline is a U-shape, with the youngest rocks in the center of the fold. Domes and basins are often considered types of folds.

What are the different types of fold?
-------------------------------------

Three forms of folds: syncline, anticline, and monocline.

Which type of fold has rocks folding up in the middle?
------------------------------------------------------

Down-folds are called synclines. The summit area of Snowdon is an example (see photo 3). In a syncline, the youngest rocks (on top) are found in the middle of the fold – in an anticline, the oldest rocks (those underneath) are exposed in the middle.

Do anticline have oldest rocks at the center?
---------------------------------------------

The oldest rocks are found at the center of an anticline. The youngest rocks are draped over them at the top of the structure. When upward folding rocks form a circular structure, that structure is called a dome. If the top of the dome is eroded off, the oldest rocks are exposed at the center.

Is a monocline a type of fold?
------------------------------

A monocline (or, rarely, a monoform) is a step-like fold in rock strata consisting of a zone of steeper dip within an otherwise horizontal or gently-dipping sequence.

What are the 4 types of folds?
------------------------------

Types of Folds

- Anticline: linear, strata normally dip away from axial center, oldest strata in center.
- Syncline: linear, strata normally dip toward axial center, youngest strata in center.
- Antiform: linear, strata dip away from axial center, age unknown, or inverted.

What are two common types of folds?
-----------------------------------

folding. B. B. Types of Folds The two most common types of folds— anticlines, or upward-arching folds, and synclines, down-ward, trough-like folds. Another type of fold is a monocline. In a monocline, rock layers are folded so that both ends of the fold are horizontal.

Where are a dome’s youngest rocks?
----------------------------------

The youngest rocks are draped over them at the top of the structure. When upward folding rocks form a circular structure, that structure is called a dome. If the top of the dome is eroded off, the oldest rocks are exposed at the center.

Which is the simplest type of rock fold?
----------------------------------------

Monocline the simplest type of fold – a local steepening in otherwise uniformly dipping strata Anticline a fold in the form of an arch with the rock strata convex upward and the older rock in the core Syncline a fold in the form of a trough, with the rock strata concave upward and the younger rock in the core Flanks (or limbs)

What kind of folds are found in sedimentary slumps?
---------------------------------------------------

Basin: nonlinear, strata dip toward center in all directions, youngest strata in center. Folds are chaotic, random and disconnected. Typical of sedimentary slump folding, migmatites and decollement detachment zones. Ptygmatic folds generally represent conditions where the folded material is of a much greater viscosity than the surrounding medium.

Which is the correct description of a syncline fold?
----------------------------------------------------

A syncline is a fold with younger layers closer to the center of the structure. Synclines are typically a downward fold, termed a synformal syncline (i.e. a trough); but synclines that point upwards, or perched, can be found when strata have been overturned and folded (an antiformal syncline). local warping in horizontal strata.

What causes a rock to bend and fold?
------------------------------------

If strata are ductile (like modeling clay), and/or the confining pressure is high, the deformation is more likely to result in bending or folding. Rocks containing pliable minerals like gypsum (evaporites) or clays (shales), or rocks that are deeply buried (&gt;10 km depth) become folded when subjected to stress.
