Is carbon monoxide present in atmosphere?
-----------------------------------------

Carbon monoxide is a trace gas in the atmosphere, and it does not have a direct effect on the global temperature, like methane and carbon dioxide do. However, carbon monoxide plays a major role in atmospheric chemistry, and it affects the ability of the atmosphere to cleanse itself of many other polluting gases.

What level of CO is acceptable?
-------------------------------

Low level: 50 PPM and less. Mid level: Between 51 PPM and 100 PPM. High level: Greater than 101 PPM if no one is experiencing symptoms. Dangerous level: Greater than 101 PPM if someone is experiencing symptoms.

What percentage of the atmosphere is carbon monoxide?
-----------------------------------------------------

0.04%  
CO2 Makes Up Just 0.04% of Earth’s Atmosphere.

What is a dangerous level of CO?
--------------------------------

As CO levels increase and remain above 70 ppm, symptoms become more noticeable and can include headache, fatigue and nausea. At sustained CO concentrations above 150 to 200 ppm, disorientation, unconsciousness, and death are possible.

What removes carbon monoxide from the atmosphere?
-------------------------------------------------

Photosynthesis  
Photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide naturally — and trees are especially good at storing carbon removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis.

Should a carbon monoxide detector read zero?
--------------------------------------------

Digital Display Note: If the unit does not sense any CO, the display reading is zero (0). In most homes, the unit reads “0” all the time. A reading of “0” is expected under normal conditions, and is good. The blinking dot after the number indicates that the unit is operating.

Are low levels of carbon monoxide harmful?
------------------------------------------

You may lose balance, vision and memory and, eventually, you may lose consciousness. This can happen within 2 hours if there’s a lot of carbon monoxide in the air. Long-term exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide can also lead to neurological symptoms, such as: difficulty thinking or concentrating.

How much CO is safe?
--------------------

The OSHA PEL for CO is 50 parts per million (ppm). OSHA standards prohibit worker exposure to more than 50 parts of CO gas per million parts of air averaged during an 8-hour time period. The 8-hour PEL for CO in maritime operations is also 50 ppm.

How do I know carbon monoxide detector is working?
--------------------------------------------------

To test a carbon monoxide detector, hold down the “test” button until you hear two beeps sound off. Once you hear these beeps, release your finger off the test button. Recreate this event, but this time hold down the test button until you hear four beeps.
