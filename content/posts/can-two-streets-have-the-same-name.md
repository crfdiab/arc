Can two streets have the same name?
-----------------------------------

Just about anything is possible in street naming. You can get duplicate streets, streets that are unique because of the direction they travel (e.g. lots of streets in Washington DC), numbers for the same street that reset when you cross into different areas.

Why do so many streets have the same name?
------------------------------------------

It is because Main Street is often followed by Second Street and there is no First Street in the town. We used to test database systems by getting them to tell us the names of all the cities in the US which had an “Oak Street”.

Do all streets have names?
--------------------------

Streets, avenues, and roads aren’t named at random — many use a series of conventions that, once you recognize them, becomes impossible not to see. Though some of these rules have been muddied over time, if you tour your neighborhood you may find these names are a surprisingly effective way to decode our roads.

How do street names work?
-------------------------

There’s no universal way American street names work, but in many cities, you have a grid pattern of numbered “streets” going north-south and numbered “avenues” going east-west or vice versa.

Are there any streets with the same number?
-------------------------------------------

The numbers 1 – 200 have been used @ both ends of the road so despite being in different suburbs &amp; therefore having different Zip codes, there are multiple locations on the same street with the same number. Here is an example. There are at least 4 streets with this name SE 258TH STREET in the small town of COVINGTON in WASHINGTON state.

How does the Council come up with street names?
