What is the relationship between temperature and carbon dioxide as the years progress?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the carbon dioxide concentration goes up, temperature goes up. When the carbon dioxide concentration goes down, temperature goes down.

How do we know what the temperature and CO2 was in the past?
------------------------------------------------------------

One way to measure past temperatures is to study ice cores. In controlled laboratory environments, we can measure the chemical makeup of the air that has been trapped – how much oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen gas was present in the atmosphere at the time it was buried in the ice.

What is the relationship between carbon dioxide and temperature over the last 400000 years?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It can be see that the rise and fall of earth’s temperatures over the past 400,000 years correlate closely with the rise and fall in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. …

What was the relationship between CO2 and temperature?
------------------------------------------------------

Siegenthaler, U. Et al., 2005. Stable carbon cycle-climate relationship during the late Pleistocene. Science 310: 1313-1317. The Holocene represents the current interglacial period. For most of the past 10,000 years, the temperature was higher than now. CO2 was fairly steady below 300ppm (vs over 400ppm now).

When was CO2 levels higher than they are now?
---------------------------------------------

Megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans, the world’s seas were up to 100 feet higher than they are today, and the global average surface temperature was up to 11°F warmer than it is now. Other estimates say current CO2 levels are the highest they’ve been in the last 15 million years

What was the CO2 level during the ice ages?
-------------------------------------------

During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has varied between 180–210 ppm during ice ages, increasing to 280–300 ppm during warmer interglacials. (wikipedia.org). A CO2 graph of the last 800,000 years can be found at climate.nasa.gov.

How is the concentration of carbon dioxide changing over time?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The time series below shows global distribution and variation of the concentration of mid-tropospheric carbon dioxide in parts per million (ppm). The overall color of the map shifts toward the red with advancing time due to the annual increase of CO 2.
