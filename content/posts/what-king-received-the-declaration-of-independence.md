What King received the Declaration of Independence?
---------------------------------------------------

King George III  
On October 31, 1776, in his first speech before British Parliament since the leaders of the American Revolution came together to sign of the Declaration of Independence that summer, King George III acknowledges that all was not going well for Britain in the war with the United States.

How did King George violate the Declaration of Independence?
------------------------------------------------------------

The Massachusetts Assembly passed a law in 1770 for taxing Government officers in that colony, but the King ordered the governor to withhold his assent. Thus, the King violated the colonial charter, and showed the little power of the colonies.

Did John Adams ever go to England?
----------------------------------

John Adams arrived in London on May 26, 1785, to assume the post of the first United States Minister Plenipotentiary to Britain. Less than one week later, he went to St. James Palace to present his credentials to the King.

Where did the declaration of Independence come from?
----------------------------------------------------

No-one. The Declaration was never sent by the Congress to King George of England. He found out about it when printed broadsheets containing the text arrived with the news from the colonies. These were first printed in Belfast in August of 1776 and carried from there to London immediatelyâ€¦

Who was the author of the declaration of Independence?
------------------------------------------------------

Two days later on July 4, a declaration explaining the reasons for independence, largely written by Thomas Jefferson, was adopted. Washington received official notification when a letter dated July 6 arrived from John Hancock, the president of the Continental Congress, along with a copy of the declaration.

How did people react to the declaration of Independence?
--------------------------------------------------------

The words were so moving that citizens who had heard the declaration raced down Broadway toward a large statue of King George III. They toppled and decapitated it, later melting down the body for bullets that would be much needed in the coming battles to defend New York and the new nation that lay beyond it.

Why did Jefferson write the declaration of Independence?
--------------------------------------------------------

Since King George III had trampled on these rights, as Jefferson argued in a long list of complaints against him, the people of the United States of America had the right to break the political bands that tied them to Great Britain and form a new government where the people would rule themselves.
