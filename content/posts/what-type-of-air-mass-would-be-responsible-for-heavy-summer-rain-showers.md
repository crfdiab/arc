What type of air mass would be responsible for heavy summer rain showers?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maritime polar air mass causes heavy snow showers and low temperatures at Buffalo, New York. Maritime tropical air mass causes hot and muggy summer weather in the Midwest and the East. Maritime tropical air mass causes afternoon thunderstorms everyday along the Gulf Coast.

What type of air mass would be responsible for hot dry summer weather in southern Arizona?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22\. In the summer, a continental tropical (cT) air mass often forms across west Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. Created by the continental effect of the heated land, this air mass brings very, very hot and dry air to the southwestern United States.

What type of air mass would be responsible for drought with high temperatures over the Great Plains?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continental tropical air  
Continental tropical air is most commonly found in west Texas and in other parts of the American Southwest. On occasion, this type of air can invade the Great Plains states. 3. Because it contains little moisture, continental tropical air is often responsible for drought conditions.

Which air masses are formed in regions where long clear nights allow for strong radiational cooling of the surface?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The central United States is a very good air mass source region. ​originate over the ice- and snow-covered regions of the Arctic, northern Canada, and Alaska where long, clear nights allow for strong radiational cooling of the surface.

Why is there no mA air mass?
----------------------------

An air mass, then, is named by the combination of its humidity and temperature designation. The very cold high latitude air does not hold much moisture and does not have heavy evaporation or precipitation, so mA air is also not found. It is cA or very cold and dry.

How many air masses are there?
------------------------------

There are four categories for air masses: arctic, tropical, polar and equatorial.

Which air mass will form over a cool ocean?
-------------------------------------------

Maritime air masses form over water and are humid. Continental air masses form over land and are dry. Therefore, an air mass that develops over northern Canada is called a continental polar air mass and is cold and dry. One that forms over the Indian Ocean is called a maritime tropical air mass and is warm and humid.

What type of weather does an air mass usually bring?
----------------------------------------------------

They can bring anything from tropical warm and humid days to arctic cold depending on the type of air mass. Fronts form the boundaries of air masses with differing properties. The most severe weather usually occurs when dry-cold continental polar air clashes with warm-humid maritime tropical air.

What is air mass example?
-------------------------

There are four categories for air masses: arctic, tropical, polar and equatorial. Arctic air masses form in the Arctic region and are very cold. Tropical air masses form in low-latitude areas and are moderately warm. Polar air masses take shape in high-latitude regions and are cold.

What air mass has the most moisture?
------------------------------------

maritime air masses  
Air masses that form over the ocean, called maritime air masses, are more humid than those that form over land, called continental air masses. The second part of the name describes the temperature of the air mass, which depends on the latitude where it formed.

Why do we get showers in the summer?
------------------------------------

The Sun (yes the great big ball of fire in the sky) is also getting hotter as the decades and century’s role on. Showers in late afternoons during summer is due to convection. During summer as land mass gets heated up, warm air rises up and pulls up moisture from the water bodies on earth surface.

What is the reason behind rain in summer?
-----------------------------------------

Once the clouds reaches sufficient humidity the convection peaks to upper layers of troposphere or sometimes upto lower layers of stratosphere. When the rising air in clouds cools down it precipitates as rain and hail. Normally summer rains do not have much horizontal reach or ground coverage. When you put water on hot iron plate what u see??

How is the air cooled by night rain?
------------------------------------

Streets in Tampere, Finland watered by night rain. There are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands.

Which is the process that causes heavy precipitation?
-----------------------------------------------------

Convective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation, while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation.
