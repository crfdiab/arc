How many days is the Moon?
--------------------------

A day on the Moon is 27.32 Earth days or 655.72 hours long.

How long is 2 Moons time?
-------------------------

The short answer is this: A day is the length of time between two noons or sunsets. That’s 24 hours on Earth, 708.7 hours (29.53 Earth days) on the Moon.

How long is 1 year on the Moon?
-------------------------------

27 days  
Moon/Orbital period

How long is a lunar day on the Moon?
------------------------------------

29 days, 12 hours and 44 minutes  
So, how long is a day on the Moon? The lunar day lasts 29 days, 12 hours and 44 minutes. And this the same time it takes for the Moon to orbit around the Earth. With respect to the background stars, however, the Moon only takes 27 days and 7 hours for the sky to completely rotate back to its original position.

What is a lunar day called?
---------------------------

(Also called tidal day.) The time required for the earth to rotate once with respect to the moon, that is, the time between two successive upper transits of the moon. The mean lunar day is approximately 1.035 times as great as the mean solar day, or 24 hours 50 minutes.

How long is a moon +?
---------------------

But as astronomers have discovered from centuries of studying the Moon’s behavior, the Moon’s orbital period (i.e. the time it takes for the Moon to complete a single orbit around the Earth) is actually the equivalent of about 27.3 Earth days – or 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes and 11.5 seconds, to be precise.

How long is a lunar day on Earth?
---------------------------------

A lunar day is the period of time for Earth’s Moon to complete one rotation on its axis with respect to the Sun. Due to tidal locking, it is also the time the Moon takes to complete one orbit around Earth and return to the same phase. A lunar month is the period between two new moons.A lunar day lasts about 29.5 solar days on earth.

How often does the Moon orbit the Earth?
----------------------------------------

, Amateur astronomer since my teens, in the space biz since 1974. Define a year. The Moon orbits the Earth once every 28 Earth days, but it orbits the Sun once every 365 Earth days. If you consider one orbit of the Earth as a lunar “day”, then the lunar year would be around 12 to 13 days.

How long does it take for the Moon to complete one turn?
--------------------------------------------------------

The amount of time the Moon takes to complete one turn on its axis with respect to the stars is 27.3 days, and it’s called a sidereal day.
