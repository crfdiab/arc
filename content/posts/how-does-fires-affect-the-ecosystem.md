How does fires affect the ecosystem?
------------------------------------

It plays a key role in shaping ecosystems by serving as an agent of renewal and change. But fire can be deadly, destroying homes, wildlife habitat and timber, and polluting the air with emissions harmful to human health. Fire also releases carbon dioxide—a key greenhouse gas—into the atmosphere.

What are some effects of fires?
-------------------------------

Wildfires increase air pollution in surrounding areas and can affect regional air quality. The effects of smoke from wildfires can range from eye and respiratory tract irritation to more serious disorders, including reduced lung function, bronchitis, exacerbation of asthma and heart failure, and premature death.

What was the effect of the forest fire on different animals?
------------------------------------------------------------

Fires affect animals mainly through effects on their habitat. Fires often cause short-term increases in wildlife foods that contribute to increases in populations of some animals. These increases are moderated by the animals’ ability to thrive in the altered, often simplified, structure of the postfire environment.

Can fire positively impact an ecosystem?
----------------------------------------

Many ecosystems benefit from periodic fires, because they clear out dead organic material—and some plant and animal populations require the benefits fire brings to survive and reproduce.

Is sitting by a fire good for you?

What are the effects of a wildfire on an ecosystem?
---------------------------------------------------

How does the weather affect the spread of a fire?
-------------------------------------------------

Windy and dry weather conditions create optimal conditions for the spread of wildfire, strong winds can help increase the intensity of fire by providing the much need oxygen necessary for combustion and spreading the wildfire. The topography of an area plays a huge role in determining the potential rate at which a fire can spread.

How are wildfires controlled in the United States?
--------------------------------------------------

Wildfires can be controlled using fire department equipment, earth moving machines, portable pumps, water trucks, and aircraft that can be used to spray water and fire retardant over affected areas. Specially trained fire-force personnel are also used to remove vegetation at the fire front and to beat out flames.

What are the different types of wildfires?
------------------------------------------

Wildfires may occur in areas with forest cover, brushland, or grassland. The various types of wildfires can be classified depending on the characteristic of the fire and the vegetative matter that fuels, for example, veld fires, hill fires, bush fires, forest fires, brush fires, and grass fires.
