Are clouds just made of water?
------------------------------

While it’s true that clouds contain water, they actually aren’t made of water vapor. The air around us is partially made up of invisible water vapor. It’s only when that water vapor cools and condenses into liquid water droplets or solid ice crystals that visible clouds form.

What clouds are made of ice?
----------------------------

Cirrus clouds are delicate, feathery clouds that are made mostly of ice crystals. Their wispy shape comes from wind currents which twist and spread the ice crystals into strands.

What are clouds made of water vapor?
------------------------------------

The Short Answer: Clouds are created when water vapor, an invisible gas, turns into liquid water droplets. These water droplets form on tiny particles, like dust, that are floating in the air. You hang up a wet towel and, when you come back, it’s dry.

What kind of clouds are made of liquid water?
---------------------------------------------

Altocumulus Altocumulus clouds have several patchy white or gray layers, and seem to be made up of many small rows of fluffy ripples. They are lower than cirrus clouds, but still quite high. They are made of liquid water, but they don’t often produce rain.

How are clouds formed in the air around US?
-------------------------------------------

If they were, you wouldn’t be able to see them. The water that makes up clouds is in liquid or ice form. The air around us is partially made up of invisible water vapor. It’s only when that water vapor cools and condenses into liquid water droplets or solid ice crystals that visible clouds form.

What kind of clouds are there in the sky?
-----------------------------------------

NASA uses satellites to study clouds from above. Clouds are made of round water droplets. This article is part of the NASA Knows! (Grades K-4) series. A cloud is made of water drops or ice crystals floating in the sky. There are many kinds of clouds.

How are water droplets formed in a cloud?
-----------------------------------------

 Dust and other particles floating in the air provide surfaces for water vapor to turn into water drops or ice crystals. The tiny drops of water condense on the particles to form cloud droplets. Clouds are made up of a bunch of cloud droplets bundled together with raindrops.
