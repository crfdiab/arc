Why did Polk believe the US should go to war with Mexico?
---------------------------------------------------------

In late April 1846, Mexican troops crossed the Rio Grande and killed eleven U.S. soldiers. In response, Polk requested a declaration of war from Congress, arguing that Mexicans had “shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil.” By May 13, 1846, both nations officially were at war.

On May 13, 1846, the U.S. Congress overwhelmingly votes in favor of President James K. Polk’s request to declare war on Mexico in a dispute over Texas. Under the threat of war, the United States had refrained from annexing Texas after the latter won independence from Mexico in 1836.

Why was the US justified in going to war with Mexico?
-----------------------------------------------------

Charles Sumner, a state legislator from Massachusetts, said, “…in seeking extension of slavery, (our own citizens denied) the great truths of American freedom” (Doc D). If Texas is independent, it has the right to own slaves. Also, states in the United States already owned slaves, so the point cannot be argued any further.

Who was President of the United States during the Mexican American War?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the early to mid-1800s, President James Polk and many citizens of the United States believed their country had the God-given right, also known as manifest destiny, to rule the southwestern territories of North America owned by Mexico since Mexican independence from Spain in 1821.

When did the US take Texas from Mexico?
