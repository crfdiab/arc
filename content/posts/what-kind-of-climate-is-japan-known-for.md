What kind of climate is Japan known for?
----------------------------------------

Japan is generally a rainy country with high humidity. Because of its wide range of latitude, Japan has a variety of climates, with a range often compared to that of the east coast of North America, from Nova Scotia to the U.S. state of Georgia.

Is it true that Japan is warming up?
------------------------------------

Japan is warming up. The Japanese mean annual temperature has increased by about 1.0°C over the last century (Cruz et. al., 2007). Additionally, Japan has been experiencing more frequent hot days (days with maximum temperatures higher than 35°C) and less extreme cold days (JMA, 2005).

Are there any changes in precipitation in Japan?
------------------------------------------------

While precipitation changes for all of Japan do not appear to be as clear, it is evident that precipitation events have become more variable. Specifically, the IPCC (2007) states that overall there have been no significant increasing or decreasing trends in precipitation during the 20th Century.

How is the climate of Japan affected by the monsoon?
----------------------------------------------------

The climate of Japan is influenced by the monsoon circulation: in winter it’s affected by cold currents from the north-west, and in summer by wet and humid currents of tropical origin.

What’s the weather like in Japan in September?
----------------------------------------------

The most intense typhoons can bring gale force winds and torrential rains, causing extensive damage. The area of Osaka and Kyoto is relatively sheltered from typhoons because it is surrounded by mountains. In autumn, September is still hot and humid, at least in the center and south of the country, and in Tokyo it is the rainiest month of the year.

What’s the average temperature in Tokyo, Japan?
-----------------------------------------------

Owing to both the high humidity and the so called “urban heat island” effect, the heat is hardly bearable in Tokyo, Osaka and in the big cities of southern Honshu and Kyushu. In the hottest periods, minimum temperatures around 25/27 °C (77/81 °F) are not uncommon.
