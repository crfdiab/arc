What is a wave that does not need a medium but can go through matter?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Electromagnetic waves  
Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space.

What are the waves called that require a medium to travel through?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Mechanical waves require a medium in order to transport their energy from one location to another. A sound wave is an example of a mechanical wave.

What are transverse waves?
--------------------------

Transverse wave, motion in which all points on a wave oscillate along paths at right angles to the direction of the wave’s advance. Surface ripples on water, seismic S (secondary) waves, and electromagnetic (e.g., radio and light) waves are examples of transverse waves.

Which is type of wave does not need a medium?
---------------------------------------------

A sound wave is an example of a mechanical wave. What types of waves do not need a medium to travel? Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space.

What kind of matter does a mechanical wave travel through?
----------------------------------------------------------

The matter through which a mechanical wave travels is called the medium (plural, media). There are three types of mechanical waves: transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves. They differ in how particles of the medium move when the energy of the wave passes through.

How are electromagnetic waves different from regular waves?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Electromagnetic waves, on the other hand, are waves that move through a vacuum as they don’t require a medium or matter. In a vacuum, electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light, commonly denoted c.

How are electromagnetic waves able to travel through space?
-----------------------------------------------------------

These changing fields form electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space.
