What did Isaac Newton contribute to the world?
----------------------------------------------

Sir Isaac Newton contributed significantly to the field of science over his lifetime. He invented calculus and provided a clear understanding of optics. But his most significant work had to do with forces, and specifically with the development of a universal law of gravity.

What good things did Isaac Newton Do?
-------------------------------------

In optics, his discovery of the composition of white light integrated the phenomena of colours into the science of light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics. In mechanics, his three laws of motion, the basic principles of modern physics, resulted in the formulation of the law of universal gravitation.

How did Sir Isaac Newton contribute to the scientific revolution?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Credited as one of the great minds of the Scientific Revolution, Newton’s 17th-century findings have molded our modern world. One of the most influential scientists in history, Sir Isaac Newton’s contributions to the fields of physics, mathematics, astronomy, and chemistry helped usher in the Scientific Revolution.

How did Isaac Newton change the way we see the world?
-----------------------------------------------------

After much tinkering and testing, including grinding his own lenses, Newton found a solution. He replaced the refracting lenses with mirrored ones, including a large, concave mirror to show the primary image and a smaller, flat, reflecting one, to display that image to the eye.

Where did Sir Isaac Newton live most of his life?
-------------------------------------------------

Isaac Newton. Born in 1643 in Woolsthorpe, England, Sir Isaac Newton began developing his influential theories on light, calculus and celestial mechanics while on break from Cambridge University.

How did Isaac Newton get his higher education?
----------------------------------------------

Like thousands of other undergraduates, Newton began his higher education by immersing himself in Aristotle’s work. Even though the new philosophy was not in the curriculum, it was in the air.
