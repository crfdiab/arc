Is Mount Shasta erupting now?
-----------------------------

USGS scientists are currently working on this question. Mount Shasta doesn’t erupt on a regular timescale. Research indicates that the volcano erupts episodically with ten or more eruptions occurring in short (500-2,000 year) time periods separated by long intervals (3,000-5,000 years) with few or no eruptions.

What hazards does Mt Shasta pose in a future eruption?
------------------------------------------------------

Future eruptions like those of the last 10,000 years will probably produce deposits of ash, lava flows, domes, and pyroclastic flows, and could endanger infrastructure that lie within several tens of kilometers of the volcano.

Where are the lava flows on Mount Shasta?
-----------------------------------------

Lava flows and pyroclastic flows may affect low areas within about 15-20 km (9 to 13 mi) of the summit of Mount Shasta or any satellite vent that might become active. Lahars could affect valley floors and other low areas as much as several tens of kilometers from Mount Shasta.

Who was on the ship when Mount Shasta erupted?
----------------------------------------------

When French explorer Jean-Francois de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse, and his crew were sailing along the coast of northern California on September 7, 1786, they spotted a smoky plume in the sky that looked like volcanic ash. The ship’s cartographers marked a volcanic eruption on their maps of the region.

Why are there so many spirits on Mount Shasta?
----------------------------------------------

In the past, no one but medicine men or women climbed up the mountain beyond the tree line. It was thought to be too powerful for ordinary people to visit, and inhabited by hosts of potentially dangerous spirits and guardians who could harm a person who traveled up the mountain unprepared.
