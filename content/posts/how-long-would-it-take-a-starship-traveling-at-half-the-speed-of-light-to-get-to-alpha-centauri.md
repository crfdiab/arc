How long would it take a starship traveling at half the speed of light to get to Alpha Centauri?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alfa Centauri is only 4.367 light years away, so at half lightspeed they journey would be 2\*4.367 years\*c/(0.5c) = 17.488 years – from the point of view of the earth. You would see the distance contracted to 3.782 light years, and thus the journey would only take you 15.13 years at 0.5c from your point of view.

How long would it take Voyager 2 to reach Alpha Centauri?
---------------------------------------------------------

20,000 years  
Voyager 1 will pass by Proxima Centauri within 16,000 years, while it will take 20,000 years for Voyager 2 to reach it, and 18,00 years for Pioneer 11 to meet our neighboring star.

How long would it take to get to another star at the speed of light?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If Voyager were to travel to Proxima Centauri, at this rate, it would take over 73,000 years to arrive. If we could travel at the speed of light, an impossibility due to Special Relativity, it would still take 4.22 years to arrive!

Can we go half the speed of light?
----------------------------------

Based on our current understanding of physics and the limits of the natural world, the answer, sadly, is no. According to Albert Einstein’s theory of special relativity, summarized by the famous equation E=mc2, the speed of light (c) is something like a cosmic speed limit that cannot be surpassed.

How is Alpha Centauri faster than the speed of light?
-----------------------------------------------------

At first glance, it would seem our spaceship is traveling faster than light, since it travels 4.37 light-years in 2.12 years. However, what in fact happens is that the distance to Alpha Centauri becomes shorter for the person in the spacecraft.

How long does it take a spaceship to reach a star?
--------------------------------------------------

Common sense tells us that if a spaceship travels at 90% of the speed of light then it would take about 11 years to reach a star 10 light years away, and that is indeed what a stationary observer would see and measure. However, for the spaceship not only time but distance will dilate and the star would be reached in about only 4.8 years.

How did the Alpha Centauri sail to space?
-----------------------------------------

Instead ofrelying just on the enormous amount of light given off by the sun, light sailsto Alpha Centauri could also ride laser beamsthat earthlings would fire carefully at those ships to give an extra boost,especially when sails were too far away to catch much light from our sun.

How is the distance between Earth and Alpha Centauri measured?
--------------------------------------------------------------

If the Earth observer sees the spaceship fly away at speed v, the spaceship observer sees the Earth recede at speed v. Let us suppose that the distance between Earth and Alpha Centauri, as measured by Earth, is Δ x ´, and we refer to the distance between Earth and Alpha Centauri as measured on the spaceship as Δ x.
