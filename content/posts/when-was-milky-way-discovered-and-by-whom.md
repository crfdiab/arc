When was Milky Way discovered and by whom?
------------------------------------------

Galileo was the first to see the Milky Way Galaxy in 1610 as individual stars through the telescope.

Where is the Milky Way found?
-----------------------------

It is located in the first galactic quadrant at a distance of 3 kpc (about 10,000 ly) from the Galactic Center. A simulation published in 2011 suggested that the Milky Way may have obtained its spiral arm structure as a result of repeated collisions with the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy.

Who first discovered the galaxy?
--------------------------------

Charles Messier  
The first galaxies were identified in the 17th Century by the French astronomer Charles Messier, although at the time he did not know what they were. Messier, who was a keen observer of comets, spotted a number of other fuzzy objects in the sky which he knew were not comets.

How old is the oldest galaxy?
-----------------------------

The oldest known galaxy in existence remains GN-z11, which formed around 400 million years after the Big Bang, as previously reported by Live Science’s sister site Space.com.

Who Named the universe?
-----------------------

A Belgian priest named Georges Lemaître first suggested the big bang theory in the 1920s, when he theorized that the universe began from a single primordial atom.

Why is there no life on the moon?
---------------------------------

The Moon’s weak atmosphere and its lack of liquid water cannot support life as we know it.

When was the Milky Way galaxy first discovered?
-----------------------------------------------

2005 — Spitzer Space Telescope data confirm what had been considered likely since the early 1990s from radio telescope data, i.e., that the Milky Way Galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy. 2012 — Astronomers report the discovery of the most distant dwarf galaxy yet found, approximately 10 billion light-years away.

What kind of structure is the Milky Way galaxy?
-----------------------------------------------

The Milky Way Galaxy. Like early explorers mapping the continents of our globe, astronomers are busy charting the spiral structure of our galaxy, the Milky Way. Using infrared images from NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope, scientists have discovered that the Milky Way’s elegant spiral structure is dominated by just two arms wrapping off the ends …

Where does the light from the Milky Way come from?
--------------------------------------------------

In night sky observing, although all the individual naked-eye stars in the entire sky are part of the Milky Way, the term “Milky Way” is limited to this band of light. The light originates from the accumulation of unresolved stars and other material located in the direction of the galactic plane.

Are there any mysterious objects in the Milky Way?
--------------------------------------------------

Around 20 light-years from Earth is a mysterious object. When first discovered in 2016, scientists thought it was a brown dwarf. Also called “failed stars,” these are bigger than planets but too small to fuse hydrogen and turn into stars. A recent study showed that the object was neither that simple nor easy to classify.
