Where do gases or steam come out of a volcano?
----------------------------------------------

Steam Vents occur on most active volcanoes and are a sign that magma lurks beneath the surface! Gases, released from solution in the magma, along with ground-water heated by the molten rock, escape to the surface through cracks and fissures to form steam vents and geysers.

How do volcanoes release sulfur?
--------------------------------

Sulfur dioxide indicates magma is near the surface (Credit: Clor, Laura. Public domain.) Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is released from a volcano when magma is relatively near the surface. If SO2 is detected at a non-erupting volcano, it could be a sign that it will erupt soon.

Which gas is released during volcanic eruption?
-----------------------------------------------

Ninety-nine percent of the gas molecules emitted during a volcanic eruption are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The remaining one percent is comprised of small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, and other minor gas species.

How are volcanic gases released from a volcano?
-----------------------------------------------

Volcanic gases. Volcanic gases are volatile substances released from a volcano or volcanically active area. Volcanic gases are always involved in volcanic eruptions, but they are often given off by passively degassing (dormant) volcanoes as well.

What makes up the surface of a volcano?
---------------------------------------

 Holes, cracks, or fissures are on the surface near volcanoes. They emit steam and volcanic gases, such as sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. Fumaroles create pathways for rising heat, volcanic gas, and magma. Openings stemming down into the pool of magma.

Where does the steam from a volcano come from?
----------------------------------------------

The release of volcanic gases and the eruption of molten rock result in a wide assortment of edifices, ranging from enormous shield volcanoes and calderas to fumaroles and small hornitos. Steam rises from a vent on Mount Asahidake, a volcano on Hokkaido, Japan.

Where does the sulfur in a volcano come from?
---------------------------------------------

All volcanoes produce sulfur. Sulfur mines are in fact predominantly volcanic affairs; Europe used to get most of its sulfur from the slopes of Etna. The Bardarbunga eruption affected Iceland badly and raised SO 2 levels even at times in Ireland.
