Can flights fly over a hurricane?
---------------------------------

Can a plane fly over a hurricane? Yes, it is possible to overfly a hurricane while staying away from the storm. Pilots check carefully for reports or forecast of turbulence when coordinating with flight dispatchers for selecting the route.

What altitude do Hurricane Hunters fly?
---------------------------------------

The 53rd WRS hurricane hunters operate ten Lockheed WC-130J aircraft, which fly directly into hurricanes, typically penetrating the hurricane’s eye several times per mission at altitudes between 500 feet (150 m) and 10,000 feet (3,000 m).

Does a hurricane weaken with height?
------------------------------------

As less moisture is evaporated into the atmosphere to supply cloud formation, the storm weakens. This change in wind speed or direction with height can enhance the mixing of drier environmental air into the storm eyewall leading to downdrafts, which inhibit intensification.

Are hurricane hunters Air Force?
--------------------------------

The 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, known as the Hurricane Hunters of the Air Force Reserve, is the only Department of Defense organization still flying into tropical storms and hurricanes – since 1944.

What happens if an airline goes too high?
-----------------------------------------

When the plane gets too high, there is insufficient oxygen to fuel the engines. “The air is less dense at altitude, so the engine can suck in less and less air per second as it goes higher and at some point the engine can no longer develop sufficient power to climb.” …

Can you fly over the top of a hurricane?
----------------------------------------

1\. Do you fly over the top of the hurricane? NO!! The tops of a big hurricane can be over 50,000 feet high, and our planes could never get up there (they can only go up to 30,000 feet). Besides, the weather we’re interested in is down at the bottom of the storm, where it will affect the coastline it hits.

How tall is the top of a hurricane?
-----------------------------------

The tops of a big hurricane can be over 50,000 feet high, and our planes could never get up there (they can only go up to 30,000 feet). Besides, the weather we’re interested in is down at the bottom of the storm, where it will affect the coastline it hits.

Is it safe to fly at the bottom of a storm?
-------------------------------------------

Besides, the weather we’re interested in is down at the bottom of the storm, where it will affect the coastline it hits. For this reason, we fly in as low as possible and still be safe. This altitude can be anywhere from 1,000 feet to 10,000 feet. 2. Is it a dangerous job?

What should the wind speed of a hurricane be?
---------------------------------------------

These should withstand wind gusts of up to 150 mph, meaning that they should survive a Category 4 hurricane. In addition, you may want to purchase storm shutters for your windows.
