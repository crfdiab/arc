Why is the moon visible from Earth?
-----------------------------------

Only one side of the Moon is visible from Earth because the Moon rotates on its axis at the same rate that the Moon orbits the Earth—a situation known as synchronous rotation, or tidal locking. The Moon is directly illuminated by the Sun, and the cyclically varying viewing conditions cause the lunar phases.

Is Moon always visible from Earth?
----------------------------------

The moon is visible in daylight nearly every day, the exceptions being close to new moon, when the moon is too close to the sun to be visible, and close to full moon when it is only visible at night.

Has any other country landed on the moon?
-----------------------------------------

The United States is the only country to have successfully conducted crewed missions to the Moon, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972….Soviet uncrewed soft landings (1966–1976)

Why do we always see the same side of the Moon?
-----------------------------------------------

Because the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth — it revolves around our planet at the same rate that it rotates — we always see the same side. While the Moon’s gravity has acted as a brake on Earth’s rotation over time, our Earth still spins merrily away in the lunar sky every 24 hours.

Can you see the moon every day from Earth?
------------------------------------------

In theory, the moon should be able to be seen every day from the earth. However, when the moon is its new moon phase of the 29.5 days phase cycle. From our perspective on earth, this is only a thin sliver of the moon that would be visible. Often this is why we mistakenly believe the moon is not in the sky.

How does the earth look from the Moon?
--------------------------------------

From Earth, the Moon appears to move about one outstretched fist to the east each night, hopscotching from one zodiac constellation to the next, but from the Moon the Earth remains in one small part of the sky as the constellations march by. And those amazing planetary conjunctions we so look forward to?

Why does it take so long to view the Moon?
------------------------------------------

Simulated views of the Moon over a month demonstrate librations in latitude and longitude, lunar phases, and variations in the Moon’s size caused by its variable distance from Earth.
