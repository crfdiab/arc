What is the geography of the Appalachian Mountains?
---------------------------------------------------

Extending for almost 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador to central Alabama in the United States, the Appalachian Mountains form a natural barrier between the eastern Coastal Plain and the vast Interior Lowlands of North America.

What type of rock is the Appalachian Mountains?
-----------------------------------------------

sedimentary  
Much of the rock underlying the Appalachians is sedimentary. Sediment from nearby eroding hills flowed into a basin called the Ocoee. Over millions of years, sediments deposited and transported by water compressed into the high-calcium limestone, dolomite and silica bedrock of the southern Appalachians.

What are the landforms of the Appalachian Mountains?
----------------------------------------------------

The Appalachian Mountains is a system of landmasses comprised of mountains, ridges and valleys, and plateaus. This mountain system is comprised of many mountain ranges that span around 1,500 miles from northern Canada through the eastern states into Alabama.

Why are the Appalachian Mountains the oldest mountains on Earth?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Geology. The Appalachians are among the oldest mountains on Earth, born of powerful upheavals within the terrestrial crust and sculpted by the ceaseless action of water upon the surface. The two types of rock that characterize the present Appalachian ranges tell much of the story of the mountainsâ€™ long existence.

What kind of plants live in the Appalachian Mountains?
------------------------------------------------------

Plants. A hiker along the Appalachian Trail would see plenty of plant life as well. More than 2,000 species of plants are believed to live along the mountain range, with 200 species living only in the southern Appalachians. Rhododendron, azalea, and mountain laurel are among those producing flowers.

How are the Appalachian Mountains affected by glacial forces?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The northern Appalachians were also affected by glacial forces. During the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago), continental ice sheets flowed down over North America, covering New England but reaching no nearer the southern Appalachians than the Ohio River valley.
