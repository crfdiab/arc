What are the major sources of ocean pollution?
----------------------------------------------

Here are some of the major causes of marine pollution:

- Nonpoint source pollution (Runoff)
- Oil spills.
- Littering.
- Ocean mining.
- Harmful to marine animals.
- A threat to human health.
- Reduce chemical fertilizer use.
- Opt for reusable bottles and utensils.

What are the major sources of pollution and its effect to the marine environment?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<table><tr><th>Type</th><th>Primary Source/Cause</th></tr><tr><td>Nutrients</td><td>Runoff approximately 50% sewage, 50% from forestry, farming, and other land use. Also airborne nitrogen oxides from power plants, cars etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Sediments</td><td>Erosion from mining, forestry, farming, and other land-use; coastal dredging and mining</td></tr><tr><td>Pathogens</td><td>Sewage, livestock.</td></tr></table>

What are the effects of pollution in the ocean?
-----------------------------------------------

Other specific effects of ocean pollution on sea life include: Oil covering the feathers of birds and the gills of fish. Skin and eye irritation and lung and liver problems from oil deposits and byproducts. Reproductive system failure from exposure to poisonous industrial and agricultural chemicals.

What are the major sources of pollution and the pollutants?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The main sources of pollution are household activities, factories, agriculture and transport. Once they have been released into the environment, the concentration of some pollutants is reduced by dispersion, dilution, deposition or degradation.

How do humans affect ocean pollution?
-------------------------------------

Carbon Emissions. Since the industrial revolution, humans have increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to levels that have caused Ocean acidification and Ocean warming, amongst other climate related negative effects.

What is the major of pollution?
-------------------------------

Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat, or light. Major forms of pollution include air pollution, light pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual pollution, and water pollution.

What are the causes and effects of ocean pollution?
---------------------------------------------------

So when these water sources are polluted, we humans feel the effects. Ocean pollution refers to the introduction of toxic materials and other harmful pollutants such as agricultural and industrial waste, chemicals, oil spills, and plastic litter into the oceanâ€™s waters.

What are the main sources of coastal pollution?
-----------------------------------------------

One source of pollution in coastal ecosystems is pollution of household waste, especially inorganic waste such as plastic bottles and cans which are very difficult to decompose. For example, it takes about 450 years to break one plastic bottle. Chemicals that each component contained could cause a severe effect on the environment.

How are marine organisms affected by plastic pollution?
-------------------------------------------------------

Plastic pollution mainly involves the accumulation plastic in the ocean waters and thus causing adverse effects on marine organisms. Marine organisms are affected by the plastics through direct ingestion of the plastic wastes and also through exposure to chemicals that are within the plastics.

How does pollution affect people and the environment?
-----------------------------------------------------

Pollution does not only damage or kill the biotic components of the waters, but it can also endanger health or even threaten the lives of humans who use polluted biota or waters. In addition, pollution can also reduce the beauty of marine and coastal waters affected by pollution. 3. Death of Biological Resources
