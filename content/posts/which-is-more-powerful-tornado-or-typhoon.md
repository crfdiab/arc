Which is more powerful tornado or typhoon?
------------------------------------------

While both types of storms are capable of producing destructive winds, tornadoes can become stronger than hurricanes. The most intense winds in a tornado can exceed 300 miles per hour, while the strongest known Atlantic hurricane contained winds of 190 miles per hour.

What is the difference between a hurricane tornado cyclone and typhoon?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, they are all basically the same thing, but are given different names depending on where they appear. Hurricanes are tropical storms that form over the North Atlantic Ocean and Northeast Pacific. Cyclones are formed over the South Pacific and Indian Ocean. Typhoons are formed over the Northwest Pacific Ocean.

How big is a typhoon compared to a tornado?

Tornadoes form over land, whereas typhoons form over water. The largest tornadoes are hundreds of feet across, while the largest typhoons are hundreds of miles across. Tornadoes tend to last for a few minutes to a half-hour, while typhoons can last for anywhere from 12 hours to a about a month.

-------------------------------------------

The central part or the eye of a typhoon could be as big as 370 kilometers. The hurricane season for the North Atlantic ocean starts from June 1 and continues up till November 30. The average wind speed of most tornadoes ranges from 40 – 110 miles per hour, but some of the most powerful ones attain wind speeds in excess of 300 miles per hour.
