Why was Puncak Jaya named after Carstensz Pyramid?
--------------------------------------------------

Discovery. Puncak Jaya was named “Carstensz Pyramid” after Dutch explorer Jan Carstenszoon who first sighted the glaciers on the peak of the mountain on a rare clear day in 1623. The sighting went unverified for over two centuries, and Carstensz was ridiculed in Europe when he said he had seen snow near the equator.

Why is the Carstensz Pyramid the highest mountain in Australia?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The reason stated by Messner, is that Carstensz Pyramid 4884 m (16023 ft) is the highest mountain of Australia and Oceania. This divided the mountaineers into two camps, Kosciusko and Carstensz. It was (and still is) difficult to arrive to a final judgment as discussed on our 7 Summits history page.

Who was the last person to climb 7 Summits?
-------------------------------------------

The last peak that Reinhold Messner climbed was Vinson on 3 DEC 1986 (in Carstensz and Kosciuszko lists) It could be thus said that Patrick Allan Morrow was the first person that finished 7 Summits including the Carstensz Pyramid (Puncak Jaya), which is in present considered as a truly complete climb of the Seven Summits.
