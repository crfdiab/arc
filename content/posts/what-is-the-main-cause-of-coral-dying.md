What is the main cause of coral dying?
--------------------------------------

When corals are stressed by changes in conditions such as temperature, light, or nutrients, they expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn completely white. Warmer water temperatures can result in coral bleaching.

What are 2 issues that are causing coral reefs to die?
------------------------------------------------------

Coral reefs are dying around the world. Damaging activities include coral mining, pollution (organic and non-organic), overfishing, blast fishing, the digging of canals and access into islands and bays. Other dangers include disease, destructive fishing practices and warming oceans.

What causes a reef to die why is this bad for ocean life?
---------------------------------------------------------

The reason reefs are dying is human activity. In some places, overfishing has wiped out healthy food chains, allowing algae and parasites to overwhelm corals. At other sites, boats dragging anchors and nets — or just scraping along the sea floor — have damaged or destroyed reefs.

Why are so many corals dying in the ocean?
------------------------------------------

If there are enough fish on the reef they can clean the algae away and allow corals to return If high water temperatures persist for a week or more the polyps reject their plant partners and the coral appears ‘bleached’. If the heat persists for too long the coral will die

What are the dangers to the coral reef?
---------------------------------------

Unfortunately, there are also global dangers facing coral reef habitat s that cannot be withheld by MPA boundaries. The impact of ocean acidification on corals is one of these dangers. Oceans absorb carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid.

What happens to the water in a coral reef?
------------------------------------------

These elements can end up changing the chemical makeup of the water, but the waste can also block life-giving sunlight to the reef. Floating trash can also cut young coral polyps off from the nutrients they need to grow into a thriving reef.
