Was Mars discovered by Galileo?
-------------------------------

In 1610, Galileo Galilei first observed Mars with a telescope and within a century, astronomers discovered several features of Mars and determined the planet’s rotational period and axial tilt. The idea of life on Mars started a long time ago, and in a way this helped fuel the drive for searching it upon Mars.

How did Galileo Galilei find Mars?
----------------------------------

Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642) observes Mars with a primitive telescope, becoming the first person to use it for astronomical purposes. The Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens (1629 – 1695) draws Mars using an advanced telescope of his own design. He records a large, dark spot on Mars, probably Syrtis Major.

What planet did Galileo discover?
---------------------------------

planet Jupiter  
Peering through his newly-improved 20-power homemade telescope at the planet Jupiter on Jan. 7, 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei noticed three other points of light near the planet, at first believing them to be distant stars.

Did Galileo discover the two moons of Mars?
-------------------------------------------

Kepler became aware of an anagram Galileo had written about the rings of Saturn. Kepler thus stated that Mars had two moons, an assertion which was later proven true. Our Observations. The observation of Mars through our weak Galilean telescopes yielded a bright disk, just as Galileo described in Siderius Nuncius (15).

What God rules Mars?
--------------------

Mars was the Roman god of war and second only to Jupiter in the Roman pantheon. Although most of the myths involving the god were borrowed from the Greek god of war Ares, Mars, nevertheless, had some features which were uniquely Roman.

What did Galileo do with his observations of Mars?
--------------------------------------------------

Galileo’s observations Galileo never mentions observations of Mars in Siderius Nuncius, but he does use observations of the distance Mars gets from Earth to support his claim that the planets revolve around a fixed point which is not the earth. Before Galileo, astronomers had noted a difference in the brightness of Mars over a two year period.

Who was the first person to discover Mars?
------------------------------------------

Kepler thus stated that Mars had two moons, an assertion which was later proven true. Our Observations The observation of Mars through our weak Galilean telescopes yielded a bright disk, just as Galileo described in Siderius Nuncius(15).

When did Galileo discover the moons of Jupiter?
-----------------------------------------------

Galileo discovered four of Jupiter’s moons almost four hundred years ago. Galileo Galilei was an Italian physicist and astronomer . He was born in Pisa on February 15, 1564.

How did scientists determine the rotation of Mars?
--------------------------------------------------

They were able to determine the planet’s rotation period and axial tilt. These observations were primarily made during the time intervals when the planet was located in opposition to the Sun, at which points Mars made its closest approaches to the Earth.
