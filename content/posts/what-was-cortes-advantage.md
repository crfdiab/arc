What was Cortes advantage?
--------------------------

Hernan Cortes was able to conquer the Aztec Empire by scaring the natives with the 16 horses, gaining alliances with the other enemies of the Aztec, having superior and better weapons than the natives (like guns), having armor, and having steel.

Why were the Aztecs easily conquered by Cortes army?
----------------------------------------------------

Cortés had returned to Tenochtitlan and his men fled the capital city during the Noche Triste in June 1520. The Spanish, Tlaxcalans and reinforcements returned a year later on 13 August 1521 to a civilization that had been weakened by famine and smallpox. This made it easier to conquer the remaining Aztecs.

What did Hernan Cortes do after he conquered Mexico?
----------------------------------------------------

The Aztec Empire had fallen. While Cortés was conquering Mexico, Velázquez was busy crucifying his reputation in Spain. Cortés responded by sending five now-famous letters to Spanish King Charles V of Spain about the lands he had conquered and life in Mexico. Never content for long, Cortés continued to seek opportunities to gain wealth and land.

How did Cortes and Montezuma defeat the Aztecs?
-----------------------------------------------

This remarkable reversal of fortune is perhaps partly responsible for the “myth” of the conquest, in which the gallant adventurer Cortés and a few hundred plucky conquistadors overcame overwhelming odds to defeat the tremendous might of the Aztec empire. The reality is far more complex, but at the same time far more impressive.

How did the Spanish win the Battle of Tenochtitlan?
---------------------------------------------------

Cortés’s army besieged Tenochtitlán for 93 days, and a combination of superior weaponry and a devastating smallpox outbreak enabled the Spanish to conquer the city. Cortés’s victory destroyed the Aztec empire, and the Spanish began to consolidate control over what became the colony of New Spain.
