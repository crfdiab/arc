How were European castles built?
--------------------------------

Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by stone. Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep.

What do you need to build a castle?
-----------------------------------

1. Agree on a workable design.
2. Source a large, and skilled, workforce.
3. Secure the building site.
4. Landscape the area.
5. Lay the foundations.
6. Fortify your castle.
7. Deal with water and sewage.
8. Decorate as required.

What was the purpose of building Bodiam Castle?
-----------------------------------------------

/ 51.0023; 0.5435 Bodiam Castle ( / ˈboʊdiəm /) is a 14th-century moated castle near Robertsbridge in East Sussex, England. It was built in 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge, a former knight of Edward III, with the permission of Richard II, ostensibly to defend the area against French invasion during the Hundred Years’ War.

Why did Sir Edward Dalyngrigge build Bodiam Castle?
---------------------------------------------------

With his knowledge of battles, he designed the castle with the intention of defending the beautiful area of Easts Sussex, from a possible invasion by the French, during The Hundred Years Wars. Sir Edward Dalyngrigge was the youngest son within his family and this meant that he was the last in line to inherit anything from the estate.

Why did Sir Edward want to build a new castle?
----------------------------------------------

Rather than using the building that he already called home, Sir Edward decided that he wanted to build an entirely new building instead. This was Bodiam Castle. It became a large project, with the entire castle being built at the same time.

Who was the person who sold Bodiam Castle?
------------------------------------------

Bodiam Castle was sold by Lord Thanet to pay the fines. The castle was abandoned and left into ruins. In 1829, John Fuller bought the castle. Then it was renovated. Get facts about Bletchey Park here.
