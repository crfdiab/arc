What are the problems caused by air pollutants?
-----------------------------------------------

The most common diseases caused by air pollution include ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer and acute lower respiratory infections in children. Particulate air pollution has been linked with strokes, which occur when the blood supply to the brain is cut-off.

What happens if pollutants are released excessively into the air?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

They can increase the risk of heart and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancer. Ozone is a major factor in causing asthma (or making it worse), and nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide can also cause asthma, bronchial symptoms, lung inflammation and reduced lung function.

What are the major air pollutants give their harmful effects?

Common air pollutants and their health effects

- Particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.
- Ozone (O3)
- Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
- Carbon monoxide (CO)
- Sulphur dioxide (SO2) Are there any health problems due to air pollution?

    Common Health Problems Due to Air Pollution. Common Health Problems Due to Air Pollution Air pollution is a big issue in many cities these days. Pollution in the air is causing a lot of health problems that is affecting the lives of many people. Ageing of the lungs occurs faster. Cells can get damaged in the respiratory system.
    
    What are the natural causes of air pollution?
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    Smoke from the combustion of various inflammable objects, volcanic eruptions, etc along with the emission of polluted gases also makes it to the list of natural sources of pollution. While looking at the man-made contributions towards air pollution, smoke again features as a prominent component.
    
    How does burning fossil fuels contribute to air pollution?
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    
    Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air that are detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole. “Burning fossil fuels releases gases and chemicals into the air.” And in an especially destructive feedback loop, air pollution not only contributes to climate change but is also exacerbated by it.
    
    How does air pollution affect plants and animals?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    It occurs when any harmful gases, dust, smoke enters into the atmosphere and makes it difficult for plants, animals, and humans to survive as the air becomes dirty. Air pollution can further be classified into two sections- visible air pollution and invisible air pollution.
