What is the continent where 30 degrees south latitude and 135 degrees east longitude is located?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The continent which includes the coordinates of 30 south latitude and 135 east longitude is Australia.

Which continent includes the coordinates of 90 degrees south latitude and 30 degrees east longitude?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

90 Degrees South is quite a lot! it’s around Antarctica, but actually no significant landmass is located on this latitude. When we look at 30 Degrees East, (at 90S) we find that we are in the waters between Africa and Antarctica- but closer to the second, so that’s the answer- Antarctica.

What are the degrees of longitude and latitude?
-----------------------------------------------

The degree of the angle is between -90° and 90°. longitude and latitude coordinates are usually expressed in degrees and minutes. Every location consists of a latitude and longitude which is like an unique address for each point.

Are there any cities in the world that are 50 degrees west?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Seriously, check the map! The only non-Brazilian place at 50 degrees West is the tiny and remote Qaqortoq, Greenland. Locations in the North and South are best known for their extremes. The poles are each covered in snow year round, so expect cold temperatures in these cities to the far North and South.

Which is the number of degrees north or south of the equator?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Latitude is the number of degrees north or south of the equator, the imaginary line that runs horizontally through the Earth. Longitude is the number of degrees east or west of the prime meridian, an even more imaginary line because it was made up. Stand up and imagine your feet represent an exact point on Earth. Do you know which way North is?
