What is the longitudinal extent of India Class 9?
-------------------------------------------------

The longitudinal extent of India is 68 degrees 7′ E and 97 degrees 25′ E whereas the latitudinal extent of India is 8 degree 4′ N and 36 degrees 7′ N. The latitudinal extent influences the duration of day and night as one moves from south to north. Longitudinal extent influences the climate in the region.

What are the longitudinal and latitudinal extent of India?
----------------------------------------------------------

Longitudinal and Latitudinal extent The latitudinal extent of India from the north end Kashmir to south end Kanniyakumari is 37°6′N to 8°4′N The longitudinal extent of India from west end Gujarat to east end Arunachal Pradesh is 68°7′E to 97°25′E.
