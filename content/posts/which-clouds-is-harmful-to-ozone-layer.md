Which clouds is harmful to ozone layer?
---------------------------------------

Nacreous are one of the most beautiful of all cloud formations, but they are also the most destructive to our atmosphere. Their presence encourages the chemical reactions that break down the ozone layer, which acts as an essential shield protecting us from the most harmful of the sun’s rays.

How do clouds affect global warming?
------------------------------------

The blanketing effect warms Earth’s surface by some 7°C (13°F). Thus, clouds can heat the surface by inhibiting radiative heat loss, much as they warm a winter’s night. The net effect of clouds on the climate today is to cool the surface by about 5°C (9°F).

How do clouds affect the weather?
---------------------------------

However, clouds do more than bring rain or fair weather. Clouds also act as an “atmospheric blanket” that helps to regulate the temperature at Earth’s surface. During the day, clouds reflect a portion of the solar energy that reaches Earth back into space. This prevents the planet from becoming too warm.

Can clouds be polluted?
-----------------------

A new NASA-led study helps answer decades-old questions about the role of smoke and human-caused air pollution on clouds and rainfall. Looking specifically at deep convective clouds — tall clouds like thunderclouds, formed by warm air rising — the study shows that smoky air makes it harder for these clouds to grow.

Is ozone layer above the clouds?
--------------------------------

Ninety percent of Earth’s ozone is in the stratosphere (the second layer of the atmosphere, just above the one we breathe, the troposphere). This ozone forms the ozone layer, which protects everything on the Earth’s surface from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays.

How do clouds affect humans?
----------------------------

The Short Answer: Clouds play an important role in both warming and cooling our planet. Clouds give us a cooler climate on Earth than we would enjoy without clouds. However, as Earth’s climate warms, we won’t always be able to count on this cooling effect.

Can smoke cause clouds?
-----------------------

Sometimes, wildfires can create their own weather. Pyrocumulonimbus are an explosive storm cloud actually created by the smoke and heat from a wildfire.

Is it dangerous to fly through the clouds?
------------------------------------------

Sometimes flying through clouds is just like driving through fog – you really can’t see much but nothing bad happens – but sometimes they can represent extreme danger for pilots, planes and passengers.

Why is it bad to store data in the cloud?
-----------------------------------------

Any time you store data on the Internet, you are at risk for a cyberattack. This is particularly problematic on the cloud, where volumes of data are stored by all types of users on the same cloud system.

How is cloud seeding Good, the Bad and the Ugly?
------------------------------------------------

The good, the bad and the ugly: Cloud seeding. The process can be achieved by distributing artificial substances like silver iodide and dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) into the air that serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei. This effectually changes the micro-physical formations and bearings within the cloud.

How does the amount of water affect a cloud?
--------------------------------------------

When warm air containing water vapour (gas) rises into the sky, it cools. In colder air, the water vapour condenses (changes from gas to liquid) into a group of tiny water droplets. We see this group of droplets as a cloud. The amount of water in a cloud, the height, and the air temperature, all affect what the cloud looks like.
