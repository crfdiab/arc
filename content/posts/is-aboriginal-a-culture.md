Is Aboriginal a culture?
------------------------

They are the world’s oldest living culture, and their unique identity and spirit continues to exist in every corner of the country. While ‘Aboriginal’ or ‘Indigenous’ may be used to describe Australia’s First Peoples, they see it differently.

Is Aboriginal a culture or religion?
------------------------------------

Aboriginal people are very religious and spiritual, but rather than praying to a single god they cannot see, each group generally believes in a number of different deities, whose image is often depicted in some tangible, recognisable form.

How are aboriginal cultures different from other cultures?
----------------------------------------------------------

While diversity exists across and within Aboriginal communities, some Aboriginal cultural characteristics are part of all Aboriginal cultures and unite Aboriginal people through shared history and shared experiences.

Why are Aboriginal people so important to Australia?
----------------------------------------------------

For Aboriginal people, their traditional Country and what it represents in terms of their history, survival, resilience and cultural and spiritual identity gives them much to take pride in. In the dominant Australian culture, land is thought of as a commodity to be used, enjoyed and owned — as a place to build a home or grow food or develop a park.

What was the impact of colonisation on Aboriginal culture?
----------------------------------------------------------

European colonisation had a devastating impact on Aboriginal communities and cultures. Aboriginal people were subjected to a range of injustices, including mass killings or being displaced from their traditional lands and relocated on missions and reserves in the name of protection. Cultural practices were denied, and subsequently many were lost.
