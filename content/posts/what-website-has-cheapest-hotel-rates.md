How do discount hotel websites work?
------------------------------------

Hotels sell rooms to these booking sites at a discount, which is why you often see rates cheaper on these sites than on the hotel’s website. They are buying rooms at the same rates as the big booking sites, but don’t need to increase their price as much.

Which is better Expedia or Orbitz?
----------------------------------

The Bottom Line. If airline rewards are more valuable to you compared to hotel rewards, Expedia clearly is the more valuable program. On the other hand, if you prefer to focus your rewards on hotels, Orbitz offers a solid, easy-to-understand program, with a few extra frills at the highest membership level.

Which is better Priceline or Expedia?
-------------------------------------

Expedia owns Travelocity and essentially provides the same experience between both sites. If you are looking for the best deal in terms of price I’d recommend Priceline as they have the largest selection of discounted hotels through their NYOP and Express Deals products.

What day of the week is best to book a hotel?
---------------------------------------------

Which is the best site to find the best hotel deals?

Hotels.com helps you find the best hotel deals via tons of filters that let you narrow down your search.
