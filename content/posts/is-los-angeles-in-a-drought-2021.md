Is Los Angeles in a drought 2021?
---------------------------------

Only Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco and Ventura counties are not under a regional drought state of emergency at this time. Los Angeles, which is partly supplied by the MWD, similarly doesn’t anticipate shortages, officials said last month.

What part of California is in a drought?
----------------------------------------

Conditions are especially bad in California and the Southwest, but the drought extends into the Pacific Northwest, much of the Intermountain West, and even the Northern Plains.

What part of California has the highest need for water?
-------------------------------------------------------

Around 75% of California’s water supply comes from north of Sacramento, while 80% of the water demand occurs in the southern two-thirds of the state.

When was the most intense drought in California?
------------------------------------------------

The most intense period of drought occurred the week of July 29, 2014, where D4 affected 58.41% of California land. The U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) is a national map released every Thursday, showing parts of the U.S. that are currently in drought.

Where was the drought emergency declared in California?
-------------------------------------------------------

A dry winter and other factors have left California with much less of its traditional runoff from snowpack in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges. Newsom said the emergency would “address acute drought impacts in Klamath River, Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Tulare Lake Watershed counties.”

What can you do about the drought in California?
------------------------------------------------

While these impacts are not exhaustive, they can help provide a clearer picture of drought in California. View up-to-date drought conditions down to the city and county level, including temperature, and precipitation conditions, key drought indicators, outlooks, historical conditions, and water supply, agriculture, and public health maps.

How did the drought in California affect groundwater?
-----------------------------------------------------

In the San Joaquin Valley, deep irrigation wells lowered groundwater levels—already 250 meters below the surface in places—putting it out of reach of shallower wells that provided thousands of people with drinking water. Elsewhere, environmental groups feared that springs, streams, and rivers would run dry as groundwater levels fell.
