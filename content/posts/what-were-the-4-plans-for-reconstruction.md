What were the 4 plans for Reconstruction?
-----------------------------------------

Reconstruction Plans

- The Lincoln Reconstruction Plan.
- The Initial Congressional Plan.
- The Andrew Johnson Reconstruction Plan.
- The Radical Republican Reconstruction Plan. What were the main parts of President Johnson’s Reconstruction plan?
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The Confederate states would be required to uphold the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery; swear loyalty to the Union; and pay off their war debt. Then they could re-write their state constitutions, hold elections, and begin sending representatives to Washington.
    
    What was or were the main goals of the Reconstruction?
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
    Reconstruction, in U.S. history, the period (1865–77) that followed the American Civil War and during which attempts were made to redress the inequities of slavery and its political, social, and economic legacy and to solve the problems arising from the readmission to the Union of the 11 states that had seceded at or …
    
    What was part of Lincoln’s plan for reconstruction?
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    Lincoln’s plan for Reconstruction required former Confederate states to do three things in order to be readmitted into the Union. What were they? Each state had to abolish the institution of slavery. They had to swear an oath of allegiance to the United States.
    
    Who was in charge of reconstruction during the Civil War?
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    Presidential Reconstruction. However, on May 29, 1865, Johnson issued his own reconstruction proclamation that was largely in agreement with Lincoln’s plan. Johnson, like Lincoln, held that the southern states had never legally left the Union, and he retained most of Lincoln’s 10 percent plan.
    
    Why was reconstruction necessary in the United States?
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
    These States have not gone out of the Union, therefore reconstruction is unnecessary. I do not mean to treat them as inchoate States, but merely as existing under a temporary suspension of their government, provided always they elect loyal men. The doctrine of coercion to preserve a State in the Union has been vindicated by the people.
    
    When did the Congressional plan of reconstruction end?
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
    The Congressional Plan of Reconstruction was ultimately adopted, and it did not officially end until 1877, when Union troops were pulled out of the South. This withdrawal caused a reversal of many of the tenuous advances made in equality, and many of the issues surrounding Reconstruction are still a part of society today.
