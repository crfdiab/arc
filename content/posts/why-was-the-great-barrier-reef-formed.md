Why was the Great Barrier Reef formed?
--------------------------------------

Coral reefs form when pre-existing reefs release a burst of larva into the water. The larva will drift until they hit a hard surface such as submerged rocks, or edges of islands. The Great Barrier Reef is a barrier reef, which borders along the coast, separated from Australia by a lagoon of open water.

What is the purpose of barrier reefs?
-------------------------------------

Benefits of coral reef ecosystems Coral reefs protect coastlines from storms and erosion, provide jobs for local communities, and offer opportunities for recreation. They are also are a source of food and new medicines. Over half a billion people depend on reefs for food, income, and protection.

Why did the Great Barrier Reef become a World Heritage Area?
------------------------------------------------------------

Port development has been the major reason for coastal reclamation — infilling areas of ocean, wetlands or other water bodies — along the Great Barrier Reef coast. The total area reclaimed within the World Heritage Area since its listing in 1981 is approximately eight square kilometres.

How is the Great Barrier Reef a natural wonder?
-----------------------------------------------

The evolution of Australia’s great natural wonder. The history of the Great Barrier Reef is a long and diverse one, where many generations of coral have built a habitat that eventually was discovered and then later settled by humans. How was the Great Barrier Reef formed?

How big is the Great Barrier Reef in square kilometres?
-------------------------------------------------------

As the world’s most extensive coral reef ecosystem, the Great Barrier Reef is a globally outstanding and significant entity. Practically the entire ecosystem was inscribed as World Heritage in 1981, covering an area of 348,000 square kilometres and extending across a contiguous latitudinal range of 14o (10oS to 24oS).

How old is the Great Barrier Reef coral reef?
---------------------------------------------

The Great Barrier Reef is an extremely ancient, enormous host of living things, composed of living coral growing on dead coral dating back perhaps as much as twenty million years.
