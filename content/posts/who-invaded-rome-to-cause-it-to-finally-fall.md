Who invaded Rome to cause it to finally fall?
---------------------------------------------

1\. Invasions by Barbarian tribes. The most straightforward theory for Western Rome’s collapse pins the fall on a string of military losses sustained against outside forces. Rome had tangled with Germanic tribes for centuries, but by the 300s “barbarian” groups like the Goths had encroached beyond the Empire’s borders.

Who invaded Rome and why?
-------------------------

The Goths, one of the Germanic tribes, had invaded the Roman Empire on and off since 238. But in the late 4th century, the Huns began to invade the lands of the Germanic tribes, and pushed many of them into the Roman Empire with greater fervor.

What three groups invaded Rome?
-------------------------------

The Goths were Germans coming from what is now Sweden and were followed by the Vandals, the Burgundians, and the Gepidae.

Did the Huns attack Rome?
-------------------------

As the Huns dominated Goth and Visigoth lands, they earned a reputation as the new barbarians in town and seemed unstoppable. By 395 A.D., they began invading Roman domains.

Who was responsible for the fall of the Roman Empire?
-----------------------------------------------------

The Eastern Roman Empire fell in 1453, when the Turks led by Sultan Mehmed II invaded and claimed control of Constantinople after a 40 day siege. Barbarian tribes such as the Huns, Goths and Vandals presented an aggressive military presence at Rome’s borders, starting in the 4th century.

Why did the Huns invade the Roman Empire?
-----------------------------------------

Like this: Because Roman legions evacuated Britannia in AD 406, the Anglo-Saxons moved into Britannia. You could also say the word “so” in between the cause and effect, like this: The Huns pushed other groups westward, so the Vandals invaded Spain, north Africa, and sacked Rome.

When was the Roman Empire conquered by the Germanic tribes?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Western Roman Empire was conquered in 476, when Germanic tribes led by Odoacer sacked Rome and deposed the Emperor, Romulus Augustulus.

Who was the Roman Emperor who reconquered Italy?
------------------------------------------------

Emperor Justinian (527 – 565) reconquered Italy, North Africa and Southern Spain for the Empire. Yet, despite his successes, his successors proved less capable in defending the Empire. Lombards soon invaded and took over a large part of Italy.
