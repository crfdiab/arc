How has the rate of deforestation changed over the past 25 years?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A new, definitive U.N. report on the world’s forests finds that the rate of deforestation is slowing down — but that its global toll has been immense in the last 25 years. 18 percent of the world’s forests were vanishing annually in the 1990s, only . 08 percent was lost annually from 2010 to 2015.

How much percentage of forest area in the country according to the national forest policy?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How much percentage of forest area in the country according to the National Forest Policy? 33%

What should be the minimum percentage of forest cover?
------------------------------------------------------

In accordance with this goal, the NPP has a target of keeping 33% of land area under forest in India because that percentage is regarded as the minimum required for maintaining the ecological balance in a country.

What percentage of area should be covered by forest?
----------------------------------------------------

NFP proposed that 60% of the land in the hills and 20% in the plains and in all 33% of the total geographical area should be under forest/tree cover.

How much forest is lost per year in the world?
----------------------------------------------

The total net loss for countries with a negative change in forest area was 13.1 million hectares per year for 1990–2000 and 12.9 million hectares per year for 2000–2005. This would indicate that annual deforestation rates were at least at this level.

How is the net loss of forest area related to land use?
-------------------------------------------------------

Further, the net loss of forest area is not in itself sufficient to describe land-use dynamics that include both loss of forests due to deforestation and natural disasters and gains in forest area from planting or natural expansion. For FRA 2005, information was sought on the current status and changes over time of the following four variables:

When do the latest forest statistics come out?
----------------------------------------------

For latest woodland statistics, see Forestry Statistics 2019, available at Forestry Statistics and Forestry Facts &amp; Figures The latest National Statistics on woodland produced by Forest Research were released on 13 June 2019 according to the arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.

How many countries have high or low forest cover?
-------------------------------------------------

High and low forest cover countries. Forty-five countries and areas have more than half their total land area covered by forests (Figure 2.4), and 11 of these have more than 75 percent of their total land area covered.
