Does the Hudson River empties into the Atlantic Ocean?
------------------------------------------------------

“THE RIVER THAT Flows Both Ways” is located between Lake Tear of the Clouds and the southern tip of Manhattan in NEW YORK. It flows 315 mi (507 km) and empties into the ATLANTIC OCEAN. Its low and high tides, along with its salty water, account for the river’s bidirectional water flow.

Does the Atlantic Ocean run through New York?
---------------------------------------------

New York Harbor The harbor opens up to the Atlantic Ocean in the southeast and northeast. The Hudson River contributes fresh water from the north, and flows 315 miles through eastern New York state. The mouth of the Hudson divides New York City from New Jersey.

Where does the Hudson River drain into the Atlantic Ocean?
----------------------------------------------------------

It eventually drains into the Atlantic Ocean at New York Harbor. The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York at its southern end. Further north, it marks local boundaries between several New York counties.

Where does the Hudson River meet the East River?
------------------------------------------------

South of the Battery, the river proper ends, meeting the East River to form Upper New York Bay, also known as New York Harbor. Its outflow continues through the Narrows between Brooklyn and Staten Island, under the Verrazzano Bridge, and into Lower New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The lower Hudson is actually a tidal estuary\]

How did the Hudson River get to its current course?
---------------------------------------------------

A buildup of water in the Upper New York Bay eventually allowed the Hudson River to break through previous land mass that was connecting Staten Island and Brooklyn to form the Narrows as it exists today. This allowed the Hudson River to find a shorter route to the Atlantic Ocean via its present course between New Jersey and New York City.

Are there any rivers in the Hudson Bay?
---------------------------------------

Hudson Bay watershed (including the James and Ungava bays) This list of Hudson Bay rivers includes the principal rivers draining into the Hudson, James and Ungava bays of the Arctic Ocean.
