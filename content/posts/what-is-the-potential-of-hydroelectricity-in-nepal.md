What is the potential of hydroelectricity in Nepal?
---------------------------------------------------

The country’s hydropower potential is estimated to be upwards of 50,000 MW – actual electricity generation from hydropower in Nepal is currently 800 MW from 20 major hydropower plants and a number of small and micro hydropower plants.

Is hydropower economically viable?
----------------------------------

Hydroelectric enterprises that are developed and operated in a manner that is economically viable, environmentally sensible and socially responsible represent the best concept of sustainable development.

What is the potential of hydropower?
------------------------------------

Hydropower has the potential to support more than 195,000 jobs across the nation in 2050. By 2050, hydropower can reduce cumulative greenhouse gas emissions by 5.6 gigatonnes — equivalent to nearly 1.2 billion passenger vehicles driven in a year — saving $209 billion from avoided global damages from climate change.

Why hydropower is important in Nepal?
-------------------------------------

Hydropower is the main source of energy in Nepal, nearly 90% installed capacity and 90% generation of electricity. There is a significant energy deficit due to the poor economic and instable government to continue the electricity supply.

What countries currently use hydropower?
----------------------------------------

Hydropower is the most important and widely-used renewable source of energy. Hydropower represents about 17% (International Energy Agency) of total electricity production. China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity, followed by Canada, Brazil, and the United States (Source: Energy Information Administration).

What are the economic impacts of hydropower how much does it cost per kwh?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the U.S., hydropower is produced for an average of 0.85 cents per kilowatt-hour (kwh). This is about 50% the cost of nuclear, 40% the cost of fossil fuel, and 25% the cost of using natural gas.

Is there a lot of hydroelectric potential in Nepal?
---------------------------------------------------

The country has abundant hydroelectric potential. The theoretical hydroelectric potential has been estimated to be as high as 83,000 MW of which 42,000 MW are considered to be technically and economically feasible. Similarly, Nepal also has huge potential for solar energy.

Why is Nepal endowed with high potential for?
---------------------------------------------

The high potentiality of the renewable energy resources available in the country is the most appropriate option for Nepal. It also helps to reduce the dependency on the traditional biomass energy resources and fossil fuels and to manage the energy crisis of the nation. This ultimately helps to minimize the degradation of the environment.

What kind of energy resources does Nepal have?
----------------------------------------------

Nepal is a country endowed with high potential for renewable energy resources like hydro, solar, wind, biomass etc.

How much of the world’s power is produced by hydro power?
---------------------------------------------------------

Currently, nearly 17% of the world’s total power generation is based on hydro resources and its share to renewable power generation is 70%. Although hydropower is produced in 150 countries, Nepal’s economically feasible hydropower generation capacity is one of the highest. However, this huge hydropower potential is still untapped.
