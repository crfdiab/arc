What is it called when a cold air mass meets a warm air mass?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Occluded Front A warm air mass pushes into a colder air mass (the warm front), and then another cold air mass pushes into the warm air mass (the cold front). Because cold fronts move faster, the cold front is likely to overtake the warm front. This is known as an occluded front.

When a warm air mass and a cold air mass meet and they stall what might happen?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a warm and cold air mass meet, the resulting front generally brings precipitation in some form, bad weather for a short period of time, then moves on. Sometimes, however, fronts stall. This is called a stationary front. Stationary fronts occur when neither air mass has the power to overtake the other.

What happens when cold air masses meet warm air masses?
-------------------------------------------------------

The boundary where a cold air mass meets a cool air mass under a warm air mass is called an occluded front. At a front, the weather is usually unsettled and stormy, and precipitation is common.”. Here is a visual to help you understand the difference in air movement during cold fronts and warm fronts:

What happens when cold air pushes warm air away?
------------------------------------------------

If cold air advances and pushes away the warm air, it forms a cold front. When warm air advances, it rides up over the denser, cold air mass to form a warm front. If neither air mass advances, it forms a stationary front.

When does a cold front occur what happens?
------------------------------------------

A cold front occurs when a cold air mass advances into a region occupied by a warm air mass. If the boundary between the cold and warm air masses doesn’t move, it is called a stationary front . The boundary where a cold air mass meets a cool air mass under a warm air mass is called an occluded front .

What is the boundary between two air masses called?
---------------------------------------------------

If the boundary between the cold and warm air masses doesn’t move, it is called a stationary front. The boundary where a cold air mass meets a cool air mass under a warm air mass is called an occluded front.
