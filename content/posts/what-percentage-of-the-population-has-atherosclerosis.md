What percentage of the population has atherosclerosis?
------------------------------------------------------

The prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis was 2.8% in the baseline survey (488 individuals out of 17,640 respondents).

How many people have atherosclerosis in the United States?
----------------------------------------------------------

Approximately 80 million people, or 36.3% of the population, have cardiovascular disease. Annually, approximately 1.5 million Americans have an AMI, a third of whom die. In 2009, 785,000 Americans were estimated to have suffered a first MI, and about 470,000 Americans were estimated to have had a recurrent event.

What demographic is most affected by arteriosclerosis?
------------------------------------------------------

Detection of CAC in symptomatic subjects is a sensitive marker for atherosclerotic coronary disease (31). Our study showed that whites and Asian-Americans have a significantly higher prevalence of CAC and angiographic disease than blacks or Hispanics.

How many people in UK have atherosclerosis?
-------------------------------------------

At least 2.6 million people in the UK have narrowing of the arteries around the heart, which can lead to a heart attack, angina, or both. Judy O’Sullivan caught up with the latest research into new ways to tackle atherosclerosis. Most of us know the outward signs of ageing all too well.

What is the leading cause of atherosclerosis?
---------------------------------------------

Key points of atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is thickening or hardening of the arteries caused by a buildup of plaque in the inner lining of an artery. Risk factors may include high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, obesity, physical activity, and eating saturated fats.

What is the most common site for atherosclerosis?
-------------------------------------------------

The most common locations for atherosclerosis are:

- Arteries in the heart, known as coronary atherosclerosis;
- Arteries that supply the legs, known as peripheral arterial disease (pad);
- Arteries that supply the brain, known as carotid artery disease. What race is more likely to CAD?
    --------------------------------
    
    Asian Indians, Chinese, and Filipinos are the largest of the seven subgroups of Asian Americans in the United States. Among these groups, heart disease rates vary widely. South Asians tend to have higher rates of coronary artery disease.
    
    Can arteriosclerosis be reversed?
    ---------------------------------
    
    Specifically, patients should be informed that atherosclerosis is a partially reversible condition if improved lifestyle (to control risk factors) and medications are taken (to aggressively lower LDL cholesterol).
    
    Can you live a long life with atherosclerosis?
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    Living healthy with atherosclerosis is possible with proper management, so take steps toward better heart health now. Atherosclerosis doesn’t have to be a losing battle. In fact, the disease can be reversed through lifestyle changes, according to the American College of Cardiology.
    
    What is the most common cause of atherosclerosis?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    What are the 4 stages of atherosclerosis?
    -----------------------------------------
    
    Atherosclerosis is the pathologic process by which cholesterol and calcium plaque accumulate within the arterial wall….The working theory includes four steps:
    
    
    - Endothelial cell injury.
    - Lipoprotein deposition.
    - Inflammatory reaction.
    - Smooth muscle cell cap formation. How old do you have to be to have arteriosclerosis?
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        Heredity: A history of arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis can predispose an individual to similar conditions before the age of 55. Arteriosclerosis is characterized by the formation of lesions on the innermost layer of the wall of the blood vessel, also called the intima.
        
        What are the risk factors for atherosclerosis in adults?
        --------------------------------------------------------
        
        Risk factors may include high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, obesity, physical activity, and eating saturated fats. Atherosclerosis can cause a heart attack, stroke, aneurysm, or blood clot. You may need medicine\]
        
        How to know if you have arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis?
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        
        If you think you have atherosclerosis, talk to your doctor. Also pay attention to early symptoms of inadequate blood flow, such as chest pain (angina), leg pain or numbness.
        
        Where are the lowest rates of atherosclerosis in the world?
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        
        The lowest rates were for the high-income Asia Pacific region (46 in men, 27 in women) and Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa (60 in men, 47 in women).
