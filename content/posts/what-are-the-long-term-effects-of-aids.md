What are the long term effects of AIDS?

If untreated HIV advances to AIDS, the body becomes prone to opportunistic infections. AIDS increases a person’s risk for many infections, including a herpes virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV). It can cause problems with the eyes, lungs, and digestive tract.

What was the impact of the AIDS epidemic?

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS epidemic has already devastated many individuals, families, and communities. The epidemic has left millions of children orphaned, has disrupted village and community life, and increasingly contributes to the erosion of civil order and economic growth.

How bad is the AIDS epidemic in Africa?

Although the continent is home to about 15.2 percent of the world’s population, more than two-thirds of the total infected worldwide – some 35 million people – were Africans, of whom 15 million have already died.

How did the AIDS epidemic hurt the African economy?
---------------------------------------------------

Reduced labour supply The HIV/AIDS pandemic has an impact on labour supply, through increased mortality and morbidity. This is compounded by loss of skills in key sectors of the labour market.

What is considered a serious long-term side effect of antiretroviral therapy?

-----------------------------------

Photodermatitis. This is a skin condition in which the skin reacts to exposure to the sun by turning darker in color. It’s most common in people of color, but anyone with HIV is susceptible to photodermatitis. If you’re taking medications to improve immune strength, you may have this reaction as a side effect.

What country in Africa has the lowest life expectancy the highest?
------------------------------------------------------------------

The countries with the lowest life expectancy worldwide include the Central African Republic, Chad, and Lesotho. As of 2019, people born in the Central African Republic could be expected to live only up to 53 years. This is 20 years shorter than the global life expectancy.

Can I try for a baby while on ARVs?

How does the AIDS epidemic affect African countries?
----------------------------------------------------

Recent studies of African countries looking at key determinants of long-term growth show a considerable reduction in the growth rate of GDP per capita as a result of the AIDS epidemic. Main causes for the deterioration in growth are likely to be a slower growth in total factor productivity and a shift in government spending towards health spending.

What’s the life expectancy of people with HIV in Africa?
--------------------------------------------------------

HIV/AIDS in Africa. Furthermore, the life expectancy in many parts of Africa is declining, largely as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic with life-expectancy in some countries reaching as low as thirty-four years.

---------------------------------------

Sometimes it is not clear whether the virus or the medications are causing the problems. The good news is side effects are unlikely with the newer HIV medications. Some of the medications, particularly the older ones, can cause problems with cholesterol or sugar levels, the health of the kidneys, or the strength of the bones.
