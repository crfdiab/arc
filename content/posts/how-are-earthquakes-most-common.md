How are earthquakes most common?
--------------------------------

Earthquakes happen along the edges of tectonic plates and fault lines. There are three large zones on our planet which are most susceptible to earthquakes. The Pacific Ring of Fire is an earthquake belt that experiences 81% of the largest earthquakes in the world.

Where are some areas commonly affected by earthquakes?
------------------------------------------------------

The world’s most earthquake-prone countries include China, Indonesia, Iran, and Turkey.

1. China. China experienced 157 earthquakes from 1900 to 2016, the highest number of earthquakes of any country.
2. Indonesia.
3. Iran.
4. Turkey.
5. Japan.
6. Peru.
7. United States.
8. Italy.

What causes an earthquake to occur on Earth?
--------------------------------------------

Earthquakes: occurrence. As we have seen, earthquakes are caused by the reshaping of Earth through the movement of Earth’s tectonic plates.

Where are the largest earthquakes in the world?
-----------------------------------------------

Earthquakes can strike any location at any time, but history shows they occur in the same general patterns year after year, principally in three large zones of the earth: The world’s greatest earthquake belt, the circum-Pacific seismic belt , is found along the rim of the Pacific Ocean, where about 81 percent of our planet’s largest earthquakes…

Where do earthquakes occur in the United States?
------------------------------------------------

Another example is the Basin and Range region of the western United States, including Nevada and eastern Utah, where the crust is subjected to tension. Earthquakes occur there on normal faults, far inland from the plate boundaries on the West Coast.

Which is the most seismic region on Earth?
------------------------------------------

The next most seismic region (5-6% of earthquakes) is the Alpide belt which slices through Europe and Asia (it extends from the Mediterranean region eastwards through Turkey, Iran, and northern India). Incremental plate movement is responsible for the most powerful earthquakes on Earth.
