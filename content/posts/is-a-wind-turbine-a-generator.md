Is a wind turbine a generator?
------------------------------

Wind turbines operate on a simple principle. The energy in the wind turns two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor. The rotor is connected to the main shaft, which spins a generator to create electricity.

What is the difference between Windmill and wind generator?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The main difference between windmills and wind turbines lies within how each converts wind energy. A windmill generates mechanical energy from wind power, while a wind turbine generates electricity from wind power. Windmills have been around for centuries.

Are windmill generators worth it?
---------------------------------

Advantages of Wind Power. Wind power is cost-effective. Because the electricity from wind farms is sold at a fixed price over a long period of time (e.g. 20+ years) and its fuel is free, wind energy mitigates the price uncertainty that fuel costs add to traditional sources of energy.

Does wind turbine generate AC or DC?
------------------------------------

The electrical generators used on wind turbines may either be induction generators or synchronous generators. The electrical power from the generator is typical 60 Hz, AC power with 600V output for large wind turbines.

What is the point of windmills?
-------------------------------

The most important use of the windmill was for grinding grain. In certain areas its uses in land drainage and water pumping were equally important. The windmill has been used as a source of electrical power since P. La Cour’s mill, built in Denmark in 1890 with patent sails and twin fantails on a steel tower.

How long does a windmill last?
------------------------------

about 25 years  
In terms of durability, wind turbines last an average of about 25 years. About 85 percent of turbine component materials—such as steel, copper wire, electronics, and gearing—can be recycled or reused.

How is a windmill different from a wind turbine?
------------------------------------------------

Windmill and wind turbine both use wind energy effectively. People of early ages, invented windmill to harness the wind energy and it was the best way to utilize this great power source. With the advancement of modern technology, yesterday’s windmill is presented to us with significant improvement as benefits which is known as a wind turbine.

How are windmills used to harness wind energy?
----------------------------------------------

Previously, the windmill was one of the most effective media to harness wind energy. The modern wind turbines of today are an improvised and developed form of what people used to pump water, grind grain, and sawmill timber using windmills. The blades of a windmill are well engineered to make the most out of wind energy.

How are wind turbines used to generate electricity?
---------------------------------------------------

Wind turns the propeller-like blades of a turbine around a rotor, which spins a generator, which creates electricity. Wind is a form of solar energy caused by a combination of three concurrent events: The rotation of the earth.
