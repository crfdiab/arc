What cultures are in Tenochtitlán?
----------------------------------

Tenochtitlan (also spelled Tenochtitlán), located on an island near the western shore of Lake Texcoco in central Mexico, was the capital city and religious centre of the Aztec civilization.

Why was Tenochtitlán important to the Aztecs?
---------------------------------------------

Tenochtitlan was the capital city and center of the Aztec Empire. It was founded in 1325 and served as the capital until the Aztecs were conquered by Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes in 1520. Where was it located? The water also worked as a natural defense against attacks from other cities.

What culture influenced the Aztecs?
-----------------------------------

As a result, historians have identified several different Mesoamerican societies that they believe influence the Aztec people in terms of their political, economic and religious practices. These include: Olmec, Toltec and Teotihuacan.

What is the historical significance of Tenochtitlán?
----------------------------------------------------

In less than 200 years, it evolved from a small settlement on an island in the western swamps of Lake Texcoco into the powerful political, economic, and religious center of the greatest empire of Precolumbian Mexico. Tenochtitlan was a city of great wealth, obtained through the spoils of tribute from conquered regions.

What is the symbolic content of Tenochtitlán’s plan?
----------------------------------------------------

While Huiztilopochtli’s temple symbolized Coatepec, Tlaloc’s temple was likely intended to symbolize the Mountain of Sustenance, or Tonacatepetl. This fertile mountain produced high amounts of rain, thereby allowing crops to grow.

Why was Tenochtitlan the capital of the Aztec Empire?
-----------------------------------------------------

The city was the capital of the expanding Aztec Empire in the 15th century until it was captured by the Spanish in 1521. At its peak, it was the largest city in the pre-Columbian Americas. It subsequently became a cabecera of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Today, the ruins of Tenochtitlan are in the historic center of the Mexican capital.

How many people lived in the city of Tenochtitlan?
--------------------------------------------------

Some historians estimate that nearly 200,000 people lived in the city during its peak. Is it still there today? Most of the Tenochtitlan’s buildings were destroyed by the Spanish and Hernan Cortes. The current capital of Mexico, Mexico City, is located at the same location.

Where are the ruins of Tenochtitlan in Mexico?
----------------------------------------------

Most of the Tenochtitlan’s buildings were destroyed by the Spanish and Hernan Cortes. The current capital of Mexico, Mexico City, is located at the same location. Archeologists have uncovered the ruins of Tenochtitlan near the center of Mexico City.

Why did the Tenochtitlan Indians build the island?
--------------------------------------------------

Huitzilopochtli directed them to build where they saw an eagle perched on a cactus, eating a snake. When they saw this exact scene on an island (located in what was once Lake Texcoco), they interpreted it as a sign from their god and founded Tenochtitlan on that island.
