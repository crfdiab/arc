What is the river water issue between India and Pakistan?
---------------------------------------------------------

Water disputes between India and Pakistan are deepening. For almost sixty years the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) survived diplomatic tensions but recent upstream water infrastructure projects have rekindled conflicts. Meanwhile, the territorial conflict over Kashmir threatens to undermine the treaty.

Why are India and Pakistan fighting over water?
-----------------------------------------------

The dispute over the Kashmir region — a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than six decades — is hugely intertwined with water security. Pakistan has accused India of throttling its water supply and violating the IWT by constructing dams over the rivers flowing into Pakistan from Kashmir.

The waters of the Ravi River drain into the Arabian Sea (Indian Ocean) through the Indus River in Pakistan.

What was the main cause of conflict between India and Pakistan?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Kashmir dispute has been the main cause of direct or indirect of all major conflicts between the two countries with the exception of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, where conflict originated due to turmoil in East Pakistan.

What is the geography of India and Pakistan?
--------------------------------------------

The geography of India and Pakistan includes the Himalaya Mountains and the Indus River as their defining features; both areas contain high mountain areas and river lowlands near the Indus River. India, due to its size and proximity to the ocean also has lowlands in its southern regions and the Thar Desert in its western half.

Why was the river treaty between India and Pakistan important?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The treaty, which kept for India just 19.48% of the total waters, is the only inter-country water agreement embodying the doctrine of restricted sovereignty, which compels the upstream nation to forego major uses of a river system for the benefit of the downstream state.
