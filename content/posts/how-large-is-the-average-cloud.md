How large is the average cloud?
-------------------------------

Summer cumulus clouds vary in size, but a typical one would be about one kilometre across and about the same tall. This means we can consider it to be a cube, with each side measuring 1km across. That means our cloud is 1,000 x 1,000 x 1,000 cubic metres in size – and this makes 1 billion cubic metres.

How big can a cloud grow?
-------------------------

Cumulus clouds are large and lumpy. Their name comes from the Latin word meaning “heap” or “pile.” They can stretch vertically into the atmosphere up to 12,000 meters (39,000 feet) high. Cumulus clouds are created by strong updrafts of warm, moist air. Most forms of heavy precipitation fall from cumulus clouds.

How big is the mass of a cloud?
-------------------------------

The total mass of the cloud particles is about 1 million kilograms, which is roughly equivalent to the weight of 500 automobiles. But the total mass of the air in that same cubic kilometer is about 1 billion kilograms–1,000 times heavier than the liquid!

How tall are the clouds in the troposphere?
-------------------------------------------

At the upper reaches of the troposphere you’ll find high clouds, which, depending on geographic location, occur between roughly 10,000 and 60,000 feet. Below that is the home of mid-level clouds, which generally occur between 6,000 and 25,000 feet. Finally, closest to Earth’s surface are low clouds, which hover at or below 6,500 feet.

How big is an average cumulonimbus cloud in feet?
-------------------------------------------------

Average cumulonimbus clouds are around 1000 feet thick their dimension are in the order of several hundreds or thousands of feet. So the answer really depends on what cloud you’re looking at, and how you define the boundary of a cloud.

What are the different types of clouds in the atmosphere?
---------------------------------------------------------

Thus, the 10 types are: 1 Low-level clouds (cumulus, stratus, stratocumulus) that lie below 6,500 feet (1,981 m) 2 Middle clouds (altocumulus, ni 3 High-level clouds (cirrus, cirrocumulus, cirrostratus) that form above 20,000 feet (6,096 m) 4 Cumulonimbus, which tower across the low, middle, and upper atmosphere
