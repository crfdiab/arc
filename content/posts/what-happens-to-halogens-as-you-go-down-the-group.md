What happens to halogens as you go down the group?
--------------------------------------------------

The reactivities of the halogens decrease down the group ( At &lt; I &lt; Br &lt; Cl &lt; F). This is due to the fact that atomic radius increases in size with an increase of electronic energy levels. This lessens the attraction for valence electrons of other atoms, decreasing reactivity.

What happens to the size of the atoms as you go down Group 7?
-------------------------------------------------------------

In each case, the outer electrons feel a net pull of 7+ from the nucleus. The positive charge on the nucleus is cut down by the negativeness of the inner electrons. This is equally true for all the other atoms in Group 7. That means that the atoms are bound to get bigger as you go down the Group.

Why is Group 7 more reactive as you go up?
------------------------------------------

Reactivity of group 7 non-metals increases as you go up. Each outer shell contains seven electrons and when group 7 metals react, they will need to gain one outer electron to get a full outer shell of electrons. This allows an electron to be attracted more readily, making it more reactive as you go up the group.

Why do boiling points increase down Group 7?
--------------------------------------------

The boiling and melting points increase as you go down the group. This is because the strength of the Van Der Waals forces (or induced dipole-dipole interactions) increases since the atoms have more electrons as you descend the group. – Electron Shielding increases and outweighs the nuclear attraction.

What is the most reactive element in group 7?
---------------------------------------------

Fluorine  
Fluorine is the most reactive element of all in Group 7. You can see the trend in reactivity if you react the halogens with iron wool.

Why do melting and boiling points increase down group 7?
--------------------------------------------------------

The melting and boiling points of the halogens increase as you go down the Group. This is due to increasing intermolecular forces as the atoms become larger, so more energy is required to overcome these forces.

Why is group 7 less reactive as you go down?
--------------------------------------------

The reactivity of Group 7 elements decreases down the group. The electrons in the outer shell move further away from the nucleus as we go down the group and the attraction force between the electrons and the nucleus become weaker and weaker. …

What is the least reactive element in Group 7?
----------------------------------------------

Revision notes on the topic ‘Group 7: Reactivity’ for Edexcel IGCSE Chemistry

- Reactivity of Group 7 non-metals increases as you go up the group.
- Out of the 3 halogens, chlorine, bromine and Iodine, chlorine is the most reactive and iodine is the least reactive.

What happens to the melting and boiling points down group 7?
------------------------------------------------------------

The melting points and boiling points of the halogens increase going down group 7. This is because, going down group 7: the molecules become larger. more energy is needed to overcome these forces.

Which group has high melting point?
-----------------------------------

Tungsten (W). From metals, tungsten has the highest melting point in periodic table. It is located in d block. 3,422 0C is the melting point of tungsten.

What is the most reactive element in Group 7 and why?
-----------------------------------------------------

Fluorine is the most reactive element of all in Group 7. You can see the trend in reactivity if you react the halogens with iron wool. Reacts with almost anything instantly. Very few scientists handle fluorine because it is so dangerous.

Which is the least reactive element in Group 7?
-----------------------------------------------

How does the size of halogens increase down the group?
------------------------------------------------------

The atomic radius (atomic size) of the halogens increases gradually down the group. The number of shells occupied with electrons increases down the group. Although halogens have low melting and boiling points, the melting and boiling points increase down the group. The molecular size of the halogens increases down the group.

What are the physical properties of a halogen?
----------------------------------------------

Halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, astatine) are nonmetal elements that are highly electronegative and reactive. Describe the physical and chemical properties of halogens. Halogens are nonmetals in group 17 (or VII) of the periodic table. Down the group, atom size increases.

Where are the halogens located on the periodic table?
-----------------------------------------------------

Reactivity decreases down the group. Group 7 contains non-metal elements placed in a vertical column on the right of the periodic table. The elements in group 7 are called the halogens.

Why do the boiling points of halogens increase?
-----------------------------------------------

Due to increased strength of Van der Waals forces down the group, the boiling points of halogens increase. Therefore, the physical state of the elements down the group changes from gaseous fluorine to solid iodine. Due to their high effective nuclear charge, halogens are highly electronegative.
