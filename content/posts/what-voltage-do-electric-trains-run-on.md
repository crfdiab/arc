What voltage do electric trains run on?
---------------------------------------

Most commonly used are 600/650 and 750 V. These are used world wide on mass transit, commuter and tram lines. Voltage is supplied to the train using a third rail or overhead lines. 1.5 kV (typically supplied overhead) is used in Europe, the US, China, Australia and a several other countries.

Why 25kV is used in electric traction?
--------------------------------------

The main reason for 25kV voltage used in railway is, that 25 kV AC more economical than 1.5kV DC voltage system. Since 25kV voltage system has higher voltage, the higher voltage reduces the current flow through conductor; this reflects to reduce the conductor size.

Can you touch train tracks?
---------------------------

Standing upon (or making bodily-contact with) both wheel-rails of a railroad line simultaneously would almost-certainly not result in a life-threatening (nor even mild) electrical-shock of any sort (they are grounded and almost never carry any more than a few stray, harmless volts of electricity, if any).

Which current is used in electric train?
----------------------------------------

alternating current (AC)  
Railway electrification systems using alternating current (AC) at 25 kilovolts (kV) are used worldwide, especially for high-speed rail.

Which Indian city adopted electric traction first?
--------------------------------------------------

The first electric train ran in India with the inauguration of services between Bombay VT and Kurla Harbour on 3rd Feb 1925 on ex-GIP Railway system.

Which is more preferable AC or DC?
----------------------------------

Answer: Ac is more preferred than dc because it is easy to maintain and change the voltage of ac for transmission and distribution purpose. Plant cost of ac transmission is much lower compared to dc transimission. When fault occurs it is easy to interrupt ac supply.

Which is more dangerous AC or DC and why?
-----------------------------------------

AC current is said to be more dangerous than DC current because the root mean squared value of AC is much more than its original value. Our heart is driven by electric pulses; the high electric frequency of AC current can affect the frequency of the heart and can lead to a heart attack.

Can you survive going under a train?
------------------------------------

So the answer is yes – it is possible to survive lying under the oncoming train, but it is very unlikely that you could survive that without a major injury. It is a good idea to stay away from railroad tracks. Sometimes trains can be rather quiet and very fast. You may get distracted or simply not notice it coming.

Is putting coins on train tracks illegal?
-----------------------------------------

Trespassing the railway track itself is illegal. The act of placing a coin on the rail is illegal too. Originally Answered: Is it legal to put a penny on a train track? Regardless of the track ownership, it is illegal to deface or destroy any US currency, so never legal.

What are the voltages used for electric traction in India?
----------------------------------------------------------

What are the voltages used for electric traction in India? Voltages used are 1.5kV DC and 25kV AC for mainline trains. Calcutta had an overhead 3kV DC system until the ’60s.

Are there any trains in India that are electrified?
---------------------------------------------------

However, Indian Railways and China Railway operate double-stack cargo trains under overhead wires with electric trains. Railway electrification has constantly increased in the past decades, and as of 2012, electrified tracks account for nearly one-third of total tracks globally.

What is the standard voltage of electricity in India?
-----------------------------------------------------

The voltage in India is 220 volts, alternating at 50 cycles (Hertz) per second. This is the same as, or similar to, most countries in the world including Australia, Europe and the UK. However, it’s different to the 110-120 volt electricity with 60 cycles per second that’s used in the United States for small appliances.

Which is the international standard for railway electrification?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Railway electrification using 25 kV, 50 Hz AC has become an international standard. There are two main standards that define the voltages of the system: EN 50163:2004+A1:2007 – “Railway applications. Supply voltages of traction systems” IEC 60850 – “Railway Applications. Supply voltages of traction systems”
