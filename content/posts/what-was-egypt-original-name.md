What was Egypt original name?
-----------------------------

Kemet  
A popular ancient name for Egypt was “Kemet,” which means the “black land.” Scholars generally believe that this name derives from the fertile soil that is left over when the Nile flood recedes in August.

Why was Kemet changed to Egypt?
-------------------------------

The Egyptians called their country Kemet, literally the “Black Land” (kem meant “black” in ancient Egyptian). The name derived from the colour of the rich and fertile black soil which was due to the annually occurring Nile inundation. It became “Aiguptos” in Greek and this then led to “Egypt” in English.

Who changed the name Kemet to Egypt?
------------------------------------

The rich black soil of the Nile Valley gave Egypt it’s ancient name “Kemet” or “Black Land”. The conquest of Egypt by the Greeks resulted in their mispronouncing their capital city Memphis, or Hwt-Ka-Ptah (Mansion of the spirit of Ptah) which the Greeks heard as “Aegyptos” which ultimately turned into Egypt.
