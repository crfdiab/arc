How does water pollution in southwest Asia impact irrigation and drinking water?

What are 3 effects of the unequal distribution of water in the Middle East?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The existing ground and surface water resources are not enough to meet the needs of the growing population \[drinking water, irrigation of crops\]

7. The building of dams along rivers make the rivers less powerful and much smaller for countries down the river. Is there unequal distribution of water?
    ---------------------------------------
    
    The distribution of water on the Earth’s surface is extremely uneven. Only 3% of water on the surface is fresh; the remaining 97% resides in the ocean. Of freshwater, 69% resides in glaciers, 30% underground, and less than 1% is located in lakes, rivers, and swamps.
    
    What are the causes of water pollution in Southwest Asia?
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    Causes
    
    
    - Southwest Asia’s biggest pollution problems come from human sewage, agricultural runoff, and industrial waste.
    - Rapid growth of industry in cities and towns has caused garbage and sewage to build up in rivers and streams.
    - Towns without proper sewer systems dump untreated human waste directly into rivers.

    Pollution &amp; Unequal Distribution of Water, Deforestation, &amp; Desertification Standards SS7G2 The student will discuss environmental issues across the continent of Africa. a. Explain how water pollution and the unequal distribution of water impacts irrigation, trade, industry, and drinking water. b.
    
    How does the unequal distribution of water affect irrigation?
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Water pollution occurs when pollutants are directly discharged into water bodies without adequate treatment to remove harmful compounds. pollution and unequal distribution of water impacts effect irrigation because it is very dificult to grow crops and it effects drinking water because it makes it unclean.

    How does water pollution affect the Middle East?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    Water pollution effects Southwest Asia because the rivers,lakes,oceans etc are effected and are discharged into other bodies of water in the Middle East . Unequal distribution is also a problem in the Middle East because some countrres tahta are downstrean get less water than upstearm countries. Dams have to do with unequal distribution.
