What is the coldest temperature in negative?
--------------------------------------------

At zero kelvin (minus 273 degrees Celsius) the particles stop moving and all disorder disappears. Thus, nothing can be colder than absolute zero on the Kelvin scale. Physicists have now created an atomic gas in the laboratory that nonetheless has negative Kelvin values.

How cold are Japanese winters?
------------------------------

Winter in Japan Winters are cold, with temperatures ranging from approximately 30 to 45 °F (-1 to 7 °C).

What is considered cold in Japan?
---------------------------------

Winter temperatures average around 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius), but there are occasionally colder periods. Summers are hot and humid, and temperatures usually top out close to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius).

Has 0 Kelvin been reached?
--------------------------

Nothing in the universe — or in a lab — has ever reached absolute zero as far as we know. Even space has a background temperature of 2.7 kelvins. But we do now have a precise number for it: -459.67 Fahrenheit, or -273.15 degrees Celsius, both of which equal 0 kelvin.

Is it colder than zero?
-----------------------

Absolute zero is often thought to be the coldest temperature possible. At the physically impossible-to-reach temperature of zero kelvin, or minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 273.15 degrees Celsius), atoms would stop moving. As such, nothing can be colder than absolute zero on the Kelvin scale.

What is the closest thing to absolute zero?
-------------------------------------------

around 150 nano Kelvin  
The closest to absolute zero anyone has reached is around 150 nano Kelvin. The group ended up receiving the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics for it. They got the prize because they ended up proving a theory called Bose-Einstein Condensation which had been made decades before it was proven.

What’s the lowest temperature ever recorded in Tokyo Japan?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Tokyo records lowest temperature in 48 years, Japan. Low temperatures in Tokyo are expected to reach -3 °C (26.6 °F) on Friday, January 26, -2 °C (28.4 °F) on January 27, and -1 °C (30.2 °F) on January 28. JMA expects a return to average temperatures (0 to 1 ° C / 32 to 33.8 °F) around Monday, January 29.

When was the last time it was cold in Tokyo?
--------------------------------------------

The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a very rare low temperature advisory for capital Tokyo as cold air started affecting the country on Wednesday, January 24, 2018. This is the first such warning for Tokyo in 33 years, officials said, adding the cold weather will continue until Saturday, January 27.

What’s the average temperature in Japan in the winter?
------------------------------------------------------

Winter temperatures average around 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius), but there are occasionally colder periods. Summers are hot and humid, and temperatures usually top out close to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius).
