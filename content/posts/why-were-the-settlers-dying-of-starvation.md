Why were the settlers dying of starvation?
------------------------------------------

Video: Quotes from the Jamestown Settlers The winter of 1609-1610 in Jamestown is referred to as the “starving time.” Disease, violence, drought, a meager harvest followed by a harsh winter, and poor drinking water left the majority of colonists dead that winter.

What are two reasons why Jamestown’s first settlers fared so poorly?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The settlers fared badly because of famine, disease and Native American attacks, but were aided by 27-year-old English adventurer John Smith, who directed survival efforts and mapped the area. While exploring the Chickahominy River in December 1607, Smith and two colonists were captured by Powhatan warriors.

What were the three main problems the early settlers faced in Jamestown?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Food shortages, disease and illness, establishing relations with the native Powhatan Indians and the lack of skilled labor were the pri- mary problems the early settlers faced.

What did the settlers do during the Starving Time?
--------------------------------------------------

There is scientific evidence that the settlers at Jamestown had turned to cannibalism during the starving time.

Why was the colony of Virginia starving in 1609?
------------------------------------------------

At Jamestown, a drought earlier in 1609 during the normal growing season had left the fields of the colonists of Virginia barren. Combined with the lack of trade with the Native Americans, and the failure of the Third Supply to arrive with expected supplies, the colony found itself with far too little food for the winter.

Why did the colonist have a shortage of food?
---------------------------------------------

Food was in such short supply that graves were robbed and corpses eaten. One colonist murdered his wife and feasted on her flesh. Food problems were compounded by continuing strife with the local native population. The Indians attempted to discourage white settlement by killing off the colonists’ livestock.

Why did the Jamestown Colony fail to survive?
---------------------------------------------

Jamestown failed for many reasons. One reason was that the people who first came over from England were nobles and people of high ranking. They did not want to work and would rather find gold than hunt and farm. They drank and used the bathroom in the same water and only cared about becoming rich.
