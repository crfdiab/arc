What is the name of the strait between South America and Antarctica?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Drake Passage  
The Drake Passage (referred to as Mar de Hoces \[“Hoces Sea”\] in Spain and other Spanish speaking countries) is the body of water between South America’s Cape Horn, Chile and the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica.

How far is the tip of South America from Antarctica?
----------------------------------------------------

Not unless you have really good eyes! The northernmost tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, which is Trinity Peninsula (or more specifically, Prime Head), is still about 980 km (609 miles) from Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of South America.

How dangerous is Drake Passage?
-------------------------------

Despite its reputation, crossing this unpredictable water body can be an unforgettable 48-hour affair. These days, with the finest equipment, safety procedures, experienced crew members and polar-ready ships, the Drake Passage can be a remarkable part of one’s polar voyage—not dangerous.

How big is the Drake Passage between Antarctica and South America?
------------------------------------------------------------------

This stretch of sea is where the Southern Ocean surges through an 800km-wide gap between the tip of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula, creating a sometimes turbulent environment. The Drake Passage is also known as the Mar de Hoces (Sea of Hoces) in Spanish.

How big is the distance between Antarctica and South America?
-------------------------------------------------------------

According to Wikipedia, the distance between Antarctica and South America is 500 miles. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake\_Passage So we need to calculate, what is the perfectly circular volume of sea ice required to increase the radius by another 500 miles? Area = PI \* (3289 + 500) ^ 2 = 45 million square miles.

Which is the shortest passage from Antarctica to the Atlantic Ocean?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The 800-kilometre (500 mi) wide passage between Cape Horn and Livingston Island is the shortest crossing from Antarctica to any other landmass. The boundary between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is sometimes taken to be a line drawn from Cape Horn to Snow Island (130 kilometres (81 mi) north of mainland Antarctica).

How big is the land mass of Antarctica?
---------------------------------------

How Large is Antarctica? There are several ways to judge the size of Antarctica. The present land mass of ice and rock extends over about 14 million square kilometres (5.5 million square miles).
