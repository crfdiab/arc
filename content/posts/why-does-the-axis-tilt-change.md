Why does the axis tilt change?
------------------------------

Axial precession causes Earth to make a full 360° turn on its axis every 25,771 years, while the apsidal precession leads to an additional 360° turn (in the same direction) every ~112,000 years or so. Over time periods of ~41,000 years, Earth’s axial tilt will vary from 22.1 degrees to 24.5 degrees …

Is Earth’s tilt responsible for climate change?
-----------------------------------------------

Human activity is literally moving Earth’s poles. Earth’s poles are moving — and that’s normal. But new research suggests that within just decades, climate change and human water use have given the poles’ wandering an additional nudge.

What effect does tilting of the Earth have?
-------------------------------------------

seasons  
The tilt of the Earth is what causes seasons to occur. These are the seasons in relation to the Northern Hemisphere. The tilt also produces effects such as the Midnight Sun, where the Sun never sets during some summer nights in very high-latitude regions.

Can the Earth’s axis change?
----------------------------

Earth has been knocked off its axis over the last 25 years, changing the locations of the north and south poles. Earth’s axis — the invisible line around which it spins — is bookended by the north and south poles. The axis, and thus the poles, shift depending on how weight is distributed across Earth’s surface.

What if the Earth axis tilt were different?
-------------------------------------------

But if Earth’s axis tilted to 90 degrees, extreme seasons would cause intense climate change on every continent. During the summer, the Northern Hemisphere would experience nearly 24 hours of sunlight for months, which could melt ice caps, raise sea levels, and flood coastal cities.

What is Earth’s tilt called?
----------------------------

obliquity of the ecliptic  
Earth’s axial tilt (also known as the obliquity of the ecliptic) is about 23.5 degrees. Due to this axial tilt, the sun shines on different latitudes at different angles throughout the year. This causes the seasons. Uranus has the largest axial tilt in the solar system.
