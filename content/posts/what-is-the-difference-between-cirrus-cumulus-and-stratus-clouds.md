Cumulus clouds look like fluffy, white cotton balls in the sky. They are beautiful in sunsets, and their varying sizes and shapes can make them fun to observe! Stratus cloud often look like thin, white sheets covering the whole sky. Since they are so thin, they seldom produce much rain or snow.

What are cumulus cirrus and stratus all types of?
-------------------------------------------------

The types of clouds can be divided into three levels, each in turn with its own main groups of clouds. All in all, there are ten fundamental types of clouds. Often, you’ll some places simply class clouds as cirrus, stratus, and cumulus because these clouds are the most common and representative for each altitude class.

What’s the difference between stratus and nimbostratus?
-------------------------------------------------------

Stratus clouds are uniform and flat, producing a gray layer of cloud cover which may be precipitation-free or may cause periods of light precipitation or drizzle. Thick, dense stratus or stratocumulus clouds producing steady rain or snow often are referred to as nimbostratus clouds.

What do cumulus, stratus and cirrus clouds look like?
