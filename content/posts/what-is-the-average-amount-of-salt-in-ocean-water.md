What is the average amount of salt in ocean water?
--------------------------------------------------

about 35 parts per thousand  
The average salinity is about 35 parts per thousand. Stated in another way, about 3.5 percent of the weight of seawater comes from the dissolved salts.

What percent salt is in the ocean?
----------------------------------

3.5%  
The concentration of salt in seawater (its salinity) is about 35 parts per thousand; in other words, about 3.5% of the weight of seawater comes from the dissolved salts.

How much salt is in a liter of ocean water?
-------------------------------------------

The salinity (saltiness) of the ocean is about 35 parts per thousand. This means that in every liter of water, there are 35 grams of salt, or about 3.5% of the weight of sea water comes from salts. The average ocean salinity is 35 parts per thousand but can vary from about 30 to 37 parts per thousand.

What is the salinity of the average ocean water?
------------------------------------------------

This would be the salt concentration in parts-per-thousand ( ). Average ocean water has a salinity of 35g of dissolved salts. Expressed in %, it would be 96.5% pure water molecules and 3.5% of salts, dissolved gases, organic materials and undissolved particles.

Where does most of the salt in the ocean come from?
---------------------------------------------------

The concentration of salt in seawater (salinity) varies with temperature, evaporation, and precipitation. Salinity is generally low at the equator and at the poles, and high at mid-latitudes. The average salinity is about 35 parts per thousand. Stated in another way, about 3.5 percent of the weight of seawater comes from the dissolved salts.

How is the salt content of seawater determined?
-----------------------------------------------

If the salt(s) concentration is more than 9 then ocean water is HYPERTONIC. 21 seawater is sometimes called “Duplase” but it is not often used. It has roughly 2/3 the salt content of regular seawater. Ocean salinity (expressed in – per mil) is approximately equal to the weight, in grams, of salts dissolved in 1000g of seawater.
