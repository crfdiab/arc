What are important parallel latitudes?
--------------------------------------

Besides the equator (0°), the North Pole (90°N) and the South Pole (90° S), there are four important parallels of latitudes– (i) Tropic of Cancer (23½° N) in the Northern Hemisphere. (ii) Tropic of Capricorn (23½° S) in the Southern Hemisphere. (iii) Arctic Circle at 66½° north of the equator.

Are all lines of latitude are parallel?
---------------------------------------

Lines of latitude are all parallel to each other, thus they are often referred to as parallels. 60 nautical miles, 69 statute miles or 111 km. 1 nautical mile, 1.15 statute miles, or 1.85 km. Lines of longitude, or meridians, run between the North and South Poles.

Which is the most important parallel?
-------------------------------------

A line connecting all points of the same latitude is called a parallel, because the lines run parallel to each other. The following are the most important parallel lines: Equator, 0 degrees. Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees N.

Which is the best definition of a parallel of latitude?
-------------------------------------------------------

parallel of latitude – an imaginary line around the Earth parallel to the equator. line of latitude, parallel, latitude. polar circle – a line of latitude at the north or south poles.

Are there parallel circles from the equator to the Poles?
---------------------------------------------------------

Parallels of latitude Parallels of latitudes can be referred to as the parallel circles from the equator up to the poles. They are usually measured in degrees. The equator depicts the zero degrees latitude.

Is the circle of latitude always the same distance?
---------------------------------------------------

A circle of latitude on Earth is an abstract east – west circle connecting all locations around Earth (ignoring elevation) at a given latitude . Circles of latitude are often called parallels because they are parallel to each other; that is, any two circles are always the same distance apart.

How is the parallel of latitude calculated in Arzachel?
-------------------------------------------------------

In Arzachel’s projection, map coordinates are calculated by first fitting the parallel of latitude and then the meridian of longitude. \[F.sub.1\] = \[F.sub.2\] then the spherical parabola is a parallel of latitude of 0.25 \[pi\] (45 \[degrees\]) so it is also the particular case of the spherical circle.
