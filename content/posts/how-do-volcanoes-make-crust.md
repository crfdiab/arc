How do volcanoes make crust?
----------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseIn the ocean, volcanoes erupt along cracks that are opened in the ocean floor by the spreading of two plates called a mid-ocean ridge . Magma from Earth’s upper mantle rises up to fill these cracks. As the lava cools, it forms new crust on the edges of the cracks.

What is Earth’s crust in volcano?
---------------------------------

Hear this out loudPauseThe crust is composed of two basic rock types granite and basalt. The continental crust is composed mostly of granite. The oceanic crust consists of a volcanic lava rock called basalt.

How does lava form in a volcanic eruption?
------------------------------------------

In the eruption process, the molten material turns into lava when it gushes out through the openings onto the earth’s surface. The process of volcanic formation begins as a result of tectonic plate movements on the earth’s surface.

How are volcanoes formed and what do they look like?
----------------------------------------------------

A volcano is a fissure – opening or vent – in the earth’s crust through which molten rocks and gases erupt. The molten rocks can be in the form of mixture of hot gases, ash, lava, or other extremely hot substances within the earth’s crust. A volcano looks like a huge heap of soil or a mountain, known as the cone,…

How are fault lines involved in the eruption of a volcano?
----------------------------------------------------------

Fault lines are the weak areas, cracks, or openings in the earth’s crust. In the eruption process, the molten material turns into lava when it gushes out through the openings onto the earth’s surface. READ: Causes, Effects and Types of Landslides

How are volcanoes formed in the mantle of the Earth?
----------------------------------------------------

The primary ingredient for the formation of volcanoes is the mantle which is made up of molten materials and gases commonly referred to as magma. When intense pressure develops within the mantle, particularly along fault lines, a volcanic eruption is very likely to occur. Fault lines are the weak areas, cracks, or openings in the earth’s crust.
