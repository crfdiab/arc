Is Euro accepted in Sweden?
---------------------------

No. But Sweden has yet to ratify the Euro treaty, which means that you can not pay using euro (€) or other currencies than SEK in cash. Please note: Older versions of the 20, 50 and 1,000-krona banknotes are now not valid. Also, the majority of older coins became invalid in 2017.

The number of EU countries that do not use the euro as their currency; the countries are Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden.

Why doesn’t Norway use the Euro?

Is the euro used as a currency in Sweden?
-----------------------------------------

Despite being a part of the EU, Sweden does not use the euro. There was a referendum back in 2003 and at that time, Swedes decided not to adopt the single currency. All of this means that if you’re planning a trip to Sweden you’ll need to get used to Sweden’s very own currency,…

Are there any Scandinavian countries that do not use the Euro?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Finland and Iceland are the non-Scandinavian Nordic countries. Iceland, just like Norway, is not part of the EU and doesn’t need the euro to be adopted.

Is the Swedish krona part of the Euro?

Why did Sweden decide to adopt the Euro?
----------------------------------------

Sweden agreed to adopt the Euro when it became a member of the EU, but such decisions need political backing by the people, and Sweden held a referendum, where a thin majority rejected abandoning the Swedish Krona. Referendums are not binding in Sweden, merely advisory, but politicians fulfilled their promise to let the referendum result stand.
