When the Moon is visible it is called?
--------------------------------------

Full moon signifies that the full visible surface of the moon – its day side – is fully turned toward Earth. First quarter moon means we see half of the moon’s day side (a quarter of the whole moon), and the moon is one quarter of the way through the current orbital cycle.

What is the shape of the Moon called?
-------------------------------------

Phases  
The Moon travels about the Earth, completing one trip in about a month’s time. During the month, we see the Moon appear to change shape; at times growing (or waxing) and other times shrinking (or waning). The different shapes of the Moon are called the Moon’s Phases.

What is it called when you see ½ of the Moon’s circular shape?
--------------------------------------------------------------

? First Quarter: We see the first quarter phase as a half moon. ? Waxing Gibbous: The waxing gibbous phase is between a half moon and full moon. Waxing means it is getting bigger. ? Full: We can see the Moon completely illuminated during full moons.

What comes after crescent Moon?

Why does half moon appear?
--------------------------

As the moon continues in its orbit around the Earth, away from the sun, increasingly more of its sunlit surface is visible. This is why the moon sometimes appears as a crescent or half-moon.

What comes after the Moon?
--------------------------

After the full moon (maximum illumination), the light continually decreases. So the waning gibbous phase occurs next. Following the third quarter is the waning crescent, which wanes until the light is completely gone — a new moon.

What are the different shapes of the moon called?
-------------------------------------------------

The shapes of the moon over a 29.5 day period are known as its phases. They are the result of the moon being illuminated by the sun in different positions as it orbits the Earth.

When does the crescent shape of the Moon appear?
------------------------------------------------

A crescent-shaped moon appears directly after the first lunar phase. The moon’s shape resembles a crescent and increases in size each day. This lunar phase lasts until 50% of its lit surface is illuminated. “Waxing” refers to the fact that the Moon’s crescent shape is increasing in size.

What does the far side of the Moon look like?
---------------------------------------------

At that point, the far side of the Moon is facing the Sun. This phase is called a new moon. During the new moon, the side facing Earth is dark. ? New: We cannot see the Moon when it is a new moon. ? Waxing Crescent: In the Northern Hemisphere, we see the waxing crescent phase as a thin crescent of light on the right.

How does the waxing gibbous phase of the Moon look from Earth?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The waxing-gibbous phase occurs between the half and full moon phases. During this phase, more 50% of the Moon’s lit surface is visible, and its size increases daily. From Earth, a full moon appears to be fully lit by the sun, meaning that the Earth is situated between the sun and moon. A full moon can even light up the night sky.
