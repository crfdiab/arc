What happens when a fault occurs?
---------------------------------

A fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock. Faults allow the blocks to move relative to each other. This movement may occur rapidly, in the form of an earthquake – or may occur slowly, in the form of creep.

Why do these faults happens?
----------------------------

Faults are cracks in the earth where sections of a plate (or two plates) are moving in different directions. Faults are caused by all that bumping and sliding the plates do. These faults usually occur in areas where a plate is very slowly splitting apart or where two plates are pulling away from each other.

Which is the best description of a fault line?
----------------------------------------------

Fault lines represent fracture lines on the surface of the Earth where rocks on either side of the crack have exhibited mechanical movements to release accumulated strain. The resulting fault planes represent the fracture surfaces of a fault. Fault lines vary significantly in their lengths and widths,…

What happens to the Earth when there is a fault?
------------------------------------------------

Faults are breaks in the earth’s crust where adjacent sections, or plates, have moved relative to each other. When a lot of slippage happens all at once, the result is a major earthquake, like the one that struck Haiti in January along the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault, which runs in an east/west direction across the Caribbean.

What are the most dangerous fault lines around Seattle?
-------------------------------------------------------

Discover in this article the most dangerous earthquake zones for Seattle and its area: The Cascadia Subduction Zone, the Seattle Fault and the South Whidbey Island Fault. The below map shows that Seattle and its surroundings is constantly being rattled by small earthquakes and tremors. Seattle is an earthquake prone area.

When do things go wrong, stay above the fault line?
---------------------------------------------------

When the result, outcome, situation or circumstance is different from what we want — in other words, “bad” — we usually want the problem to be about someone or something else — not us.
