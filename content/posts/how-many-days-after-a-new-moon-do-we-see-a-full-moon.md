How many days after a new moon do we see a full moon?
-----------------------------------------------------

29.5 days  
The Moon takes 27.3 days to orbit Earth, but the lunar phase cycle (from new Moon to new Moon) is 29.5 days. The Moon spends the extra 2.2 days “catching up” because Earth travels about 45 million miles around the Sun during the time the Moon completes one orbit around Earth.

How many days are between each full moon?
-----------------------------------------

How often does a full Moon occur? A full Moon happens roughly every 29.5 days. This is the length of time it takes for the Moon to go through one whole lunar phase cycle.

How long does it take from New Moon to full moon?
-------------------------------------------------

The Moon takes almost 15 days to reach from the new moon to the full moon. Well, technically, not 15 days, but 14. 81 days. In fact, only on a full moon, a lunar eclipse can occur. The Full Moon always occurs when the moon is totally on the opposite side of the earth.

When is the next new moon going to be?
--------------------------------------

If the next location of the new moon occurs closer to the pericenter, then the next new moon will occur in slightly less than 29.5 days. Conversely, if the next location of the new moon takes it further away from the pericenter, then the next new moon will occur slightly after 29.5 days. This page was last updated on July 18, 2015.

How long is the menstrual cycle during a full moon?
---------------------------------------------------

How long are lunar and menstrual cycles? A full lunar cycle lasts from one new moon to the next and takes 29.5 days. The average menstrual cycle is also around 28–29 days long. However, the actual duration varies from person to person and month to month, ranging from approximately 21 to 35 days.

How long does the synodic month of the Moon last?
-------------------------------------------------

One synodic month (from new moon to new moon) lasts 29.5 days, but you could argue that full moon for instance lasts only about a day or even less than that, depending on how good your eyes or telescope are, to see that it isn’t exactly full anymore.
