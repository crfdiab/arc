What latitudes are most favorable for a tornado?
------------------------------------------------

Globally, the middle latitudes, between about 30° and 50° North or South, provide the most favorable environment for tornadogenesis. This is the region where cold, polar air meets against warmer, subtropical air, often generating convective precipitation along the collision boundaries.

Where is the best place to be during a tornado strike?
------------------------------------------------------

Although there is no completely safe place during a tornado, some locations are much safer than others. Go to the basement or an inside room without windows on the lowest floor (bathroom, closet, center hallway). If possible, avoid sheltering in a room with windows.

Why are tornado warnings delayed for so long?
---------------------------------------------

Warnings are delayed. If you are currently affected by severe storms, you should also be paying attention to a local source of information (tv, radio, etc), or have a weather radio, because information on this site can be delayed enough that it could cause you to lose valuable lead time. The map sometimes breaks in odd ways.
