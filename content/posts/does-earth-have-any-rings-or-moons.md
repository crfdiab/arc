Does Earth have any rings or moons?
-----------------------------------

Earth has no rings.

Does Earth have a ring system?
------------------------------

If you’re talking about majestic ice rings, like we see around Saturn, Uranus or Jupiter, then no, Earth doesn’t have rings, and probably never did. This ring would cast a shadow down on the surface of the Earth, changing the planet’s climate, and could last for a few million years at most.

How many moons and rings does Earth have?

Are there any other moons in the Solar System?
----------------------------------------------

You can see only one moon, “the” Moon. But does the Earth have any other moons? Around the Solar System, multiple moons are the rule. Jupiter has 67 natural satellites, even Mars has two asteroid-like moons. Could Earth have more than one?

Are there any moons with rings on them?
---------------------------------------

The biggest surprise is just that. No moonlets, no rings, nothing else, so far anyway. And they searched pretty thoroughly before the encounter to make sure New Horizons wasn’t on target to hit anything. This search was sensitive enough to find moons fifteen times fainter than Styx.

Why does the Earth have so many moons?
--------------------------------------

It’s also possible that the Earth might capture a Moon in the future. Neptune’s largest moon, Triton, orbits in the opposite direction from the rest of the moons around the planet. This suggests that Triton was actually a captured Kuiper Belt Object which strayed too close to the planet.

How many moons does Mars and Earth have?
----------------------------------------

For example, Mars has two Moons, but not for long. Phobos, the larger moon, is spiraling inward and expected to crash into the planet within the next 10 million years. And so, in the future, Mars will only have a single Moon, Deimos. It’s also possible that the Earth might capture a Moon in the future.
