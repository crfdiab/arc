How high is an emergent tree?
-----------------------------

200 feet  
EMERGENT LAYER The tallest trees are the emergents, towering as much as 200 feet above the forest floor with trunks that measure up to 16 feet around. Most of these trees are broad-leaved, hardwood evergreens. Sunlight is plentiful up here. Animals found are eagles, monkeys, bats and butterflies.

Why do emergent trees have waxy leaves?
---------------------------------------

Because the sun is very hot, the trees of the emergent layer have a special adaptation: their leaves have a waxy coating that helps protect against the harsh rays of the sun. In addition to getting a lot of sunlight, the trees in the emergent layer are also more exposed to the heavy winds.

What animals are in the emergent layer?
---------------------------------------

The animals living in the emergent layer of the Amazon rainforest include birds, bats, gliders, and butterflies. Large raptors, such as white-tailed hawks and harpy eagles, are its top predators. In rainforests on the island of New Guinea, pygmy gliders populate the emergent layer.

Which is an example of an emergent tree?
----------------------------------------

The moabi is new an emergent tree, one of those that dominate the forest ocean for over a thousand years. Differences in the volume increment between released and control trees varied with canopy position, with emergent trees showing the greatest increased volume growth, followed by dominant and intermediate classes, respectively.

Who are the professionals at emergent tree education?
-----------------------------------------------------

Emergent Tree has supported us in shifting our lens, changing our practices, and re-defining how we see and address student behavior. The team of professionals at Emergent Tree truly cares about kidsâ€¦and educators!

How tall are the trees in the emergent layer?
---------------------------------------------

The tallest trees are the emergent trees, towering as much as 200 feet above the forest floor with trunks that measure up to 16 feet around. Most of these trees are broad-leaved, hardwood evergreens. Sunlight is plentiful up here.

What makes an emergent tree a nest site?
----------------------------------------

The apertures may be larger at the top end of the tree shelter than at the bottom, and the top end may be moulded with an internal curve to prevent damage to an emerging tree. Nest-trees had significantly larger diameter and ramification height than the four nearest-neighbor trees, indicating that macaws selected tall emergent trees as nest-sites.
