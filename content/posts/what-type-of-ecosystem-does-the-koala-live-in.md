eucalyptus forests  
Koalas live in the eucalyptus forests of southeastern and eastern Australia. When not sleeping, they’re usually eating. They rely on the eucalyptus tree for both habitat and food.

How do adaptations help animals survive in their environment?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Adaptation can protect animals from predators or from harsh weather. Many birds can hide in the tall grass and weeds and insects can change their colour to blend into the surroundings. This makes it difficult for predators to seek them out for food.

What do koalas do to help them survive?
---------------------------------------

Tough textured skin on the soles of their feet along with long sharp claws provide traction, and strong thigh muscles aid in climbing. Extra thick fur on their bottoms and a cartilaginous pad at the base of their spines provide cushioning so koalas can sit comfortably on branches for hours.

How are koalas adapted to live in the trees?
--------------------------------------------

Adaptive traits can improve an animal’s ability to find food, make a safer home, escape predators, survive cold or heat or lack of water. The koala has feet well-adapted for their life in the trees. Their front paws each have five digits – two of them are thumb-like and opposable.

What kind of senses does a koala have?
--------------------------------------

Koalas have large noses and really rely on their sense of smells. They also have big, padded claws. with long fingernails. The big padded claws help with climbing trees.Here is a picture of a Koalas paw stretched out while climbing the tree. Koalas have thick, heavy fur.

Why do koalas not need coats or umbrellas?
------------------------------------------

Physical Adaptations. Koalas also don’t need coats or umbrellas to keep warm and dry. They have thick woolly fur that protects them from extreme temperatures and acts as a rain repellent. This fur also keeps them safe because it’s a speckled color that camouflages them in the trees.

Why do koalas only eat one thing a day?
---------------------------------------

They have thick woolly fur that protects them from extreme temperatures and acts as a rain repellent. This fur also keeps them safe because it’s a speckled color that camouflages them in the trees.
