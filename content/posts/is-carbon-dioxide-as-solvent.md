Is carbon dioxide as solvent?
-----------------------------

Supercritical carbon dioxide: a solvent like no other.

What type of matter is carbon dioxide gas?
------------------------------------------

Carbon dioxide is a colorless and non-flammable gas at normal temperature and pressure. Although much less abundant than nitrogen and oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere, carbon dioxide is an important constituent of our planet’s air. A molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2) is made up of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.

Is carbon dioxide a gas liquid or solid?
----------------------------------------

Carbon dioxide; is an odourless, colourless gas, which is acidic and non-flammable. It also has a solid and a liquid form. Carbon dioxide is a molecule with the molecular formula CO2. Carbon dioxide, CO2, is a colorless gas.

Is carbon dioxide gas a matter?
-------------------------------

WHY IS CO2 Carbon dioxide is a gas consisting of one part carbon and two parts oxygen. It is one of the most important gases on the earth because plants use it to produce carbohydrates in a process called photosynthesis.

What is the solvent for carbon dioxide?
---------------------------------------

Solvents currently used for physical absorption of carbon dioxide are, for example, methanol, sulfolane and poly(ethylene glycol) ethers.

What element absorbs CO2?
-------------------------

Other strong bases such as soda lime, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and lithium hydroxide are able to remove carbon dioxide by chemically reacting with it. In particular, lithium hydroxide was used aboard spacecraft, such as in the Apollo program, to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Where is co2 gas from?
----------------------

Natural sources of carbon dioxide include most animals, which exhale carbon dioxide as a waste product. Human activities that lead to carbon dioxide emissions come primarily from energy production, including burning coal, oil, or natural gas.

Which is not characteristic of carbon dioxide gas?
--------------------------------------------------

Carbon dioxide is colorless. At low concentrations thegas is odorless; however, at sufficiently-high concentrations, it has a sharp, acidic odor. At standard temperature and pressure, the density of carbon dioxide is around 1.98 kg/m3, about 1.67 times that of air.

How can carbon dioxide gas be changed to liquid carbon dioxide without reducing its temperature?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This process is called sublimation. At atmospheric pressure, it turns straight into gaseous carbon dioxide. Liquid carbon dioxide can only exist under high pressure, such as in fire extinguishers.

Where is CO2 gas from?
----------------------

Which chemical is used to absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

chemical sodium hydroxide  
The chemical sodium hydroxide is placed in the bag with the plant to absorb the carbon dioxide.

What happens when carbon dioxide is dissolved in water?
-------------------------------------------------------

When carbon dioxide gas is dissolved in water, the carbon dioxide gas is called the: a. Solute b. Solution c. Solvent d. Fluid | Study.com

Why is carbon dioxide considered to be a gas?
---------------------------------------------

Carbon dioxide is not visible and which means it has large intermolecular spaces so it is a gas Carbon dioxide is made of one carbon and 2 oxygen molecules so the gas molecules dominate and hence it is a gas Carbon dioxide is a gas and some of the important properties that justify this statement are,

How to justify a statement about carbon dioxide?
------------------------------------------------

Justify the given statement by giving two reason. Carbon dioxide is not visible and which means it has large intermolecular spaces so it is a gas Carbon dioxide is made of one carbon and 2 oxygen molecules so the gas molecules dominate and hence it is a gas

What are the physical properties of carbon dioxide?
---------------------------------------------------

Physical properties. Liquid carbon dioxide forms only at pressures above 5.1 atm; the triple point of carbon dioxide is about 5.1 bar (517 kPa) at 217 K (see phase diagram). The critical point is 7.38 MPa at 31.1 °C. Another form of solid carbon dioxide observed at high pressure is an amorphous glass-like solid.
