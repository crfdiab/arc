Why did the Mongols stop invading Japan?
----------------------------------------

Due to samurai strength, strong feudal systems, environmental factors, and just sheer bad luck, the Mongols were unable to conquer Japan. The Mongols failed to conquer Japan even though they had previously managed to conquer Korea and the much, much larger country of China.

What saved Japan from getting attacked by the Mongols?
------------------------------------------------------

The kamikaze (Japanese: 神風) literally “divine wind” were two winds or storms that are said to have saved Japan from two Mongol fleets under Kublai Khan.

Who did the Mongols spare when going into battle?
-------------------------------------------------

These conquests involved invasions of Russia, Hungary, Volga Bulgaria, Poland, Dalmatia, and Wallachia. Over the course of four years (1237–1241), the Mongols quickly overtook most of the major eastern European cities, only sparing Novgorod and Pskov.

What prevented Mongols from invading Japan?
-------------------------------------------

Legend holds that the kamikaze, or “divine wind,” prevented the Mongolian invasion of Japan in 1281, as depicted in this 19th-century piece by artist Issho Yada.

How did the Mongols invade Japan in 1274?
-----------------------------------------

All Japan could muster was 10,000 samurai, all from the various samurai clans who were more used to fighting each other than outside enemies. In 1274, the Mongols began their invasion. They approached Japan like a storm, easily conquering the small islands between Korea and Japan and then landing on Kyushu.

How did Kublai Khan survive the Mongol invasion?
------------------------------------------------

Kublai Khan survived, made it home with only a handful of ships, and never tried to invade Japan again. Once again, the Mongol invasion had been stopped by luck. Later, the Japanese would coin the phrase kamikaze (“divine wind”) in reference to the event.

How did the Mongol invasion affect the Muslim world?
----------------------------------------------------

The Mongol invasion is one of the most demoralizing times of Islamic history. The death and destruction of the 1200s have not yet been seen again in the Muslim world. The Muslim world was largely unable to repel the Mongol invasion due to disunity and weak political and military institutions.

What did Genghis Khan do during his reign?
------------------------------------------

Mongolian (and world) history changed forever during the rule of Genghis Khan. He was a tribal chief for the Mongols from 1206-1227. During his reign, he managed to unite the many Mongol tribes along with numerous Turkic tribes as well. With a large, unified group, he set about conquering any and all land the Mongol horsemen could reach.
