Which elements are from space?
------------------------------

- 1.) Hydrogen. Created during the hot Big Bang but depleted by stellar fusion, ~70% of the Universe remains hydrogen.
- 2.) Helium. About 28% is helium, with 25% formed in the Big Bang and 3% from stellar fusion.
- 3.) Oxygen.
- 4.) Carbon.
- 5.) Neon.
- 6.) Nitrogen.
- 7.) Magnesium.
- 8.) Silicon.

What chemical compounds are also found in space?
------------------------------------------------

Observations with radio waves carried out in the seventies proved that interstellar space is not only full of hydrogen and dust, but also contains complex chemical compounds, or gaseous molecules, such as water (H20), ammonium (NH3) and methanol (CH3OH).

What element is named after the universe?
-----------------------------------------

Astronomical objects Uranium, neptunium, plutonium, cerium, and palladium were named after Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Ceres, and Pallas, respectively.

What is the most common chemical element in space?
--------------------------------------------------

Hydrogen  
Hydrogen — with just one proton and one electron (it’s the only element without a neutron) — is the simplest element in the universe, which explains why it’s also the most abundant, Nyman said.

What elements do not exist on Earth?
------------------------------------

But when we look at the full gamut of elements in the periodic table, there’s one missing that you might have expected to be there: the 43rd one, Technetium, a shiny, gray metal as dense as lead with a melting point of over 3,000 °F, that simply doesn’t occur naturally on our world.

What are the 5 most common elements on Earth?
---------------------------------------------

The mass-abundance of the nine most abundant elements in the Earth’s crust is approximately: oxygen 46%, silicon 28%, aluminum 8.3%, iron 5.6%, calcium 4.2%, sodium 2.5%, magnesium 2.4%, potassium 2.0%, and titanium 0.61%.

Which is the most common chemical element in the universe?
----------------------------------------------------------

There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radionuclides, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth’s crust. Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe.

How are the heaviest elements in the universe created?
------------------------------------------------------

The findings shed light on how the universe’s heaviest elements are created, providing a missing piece of the puzzle of chemical element formation, researchers said in a new study describing the findings.

Which is the only chemical species in interstellar space?
---------------------------------------------------------

While radio astronomy was developed in the 1930s, it was not until 1937 that any substantial evidence arose for the conclusive identification of an interstellar molecule – up until this point, the only chemical species known to exist in interstellar space were atomic.

Where do all of the elements in a star come from?
-------------------------------------------------

Burning helium produces carbon, which burns to produce oxygen, and so on. Massive stars are made of onion-like layers, with the outer layer burning lighter elements, converting them into heavier elements that are burned in the inner layers.
