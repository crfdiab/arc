How do elephants warn each other?
---------------------------------

When they’re excited, scared or happy, elephants make the trumpeting sounds you’re probably familiar with. They vocalize in other, more complicated ways, too — low-pitched rumbles outside our range of hearing. At less than 20 hertz, these infrasonic calls are often used to alert each other to danger.

How do elephants help other animals?
------------------------------------

As the largest of all land mammals, African elephants play an important role in balancing natural ecosystems. They trample forests and dense grasslands, making room for smaller species to co-exist. Elephants also create water holes used by other wildlife as they dig dry riverbeds when rainfall is low.

How do elephants benefit the environment?
-----------------------------------------

Elephants help maintain forest and savanna ecosystems for other species and are integrally tied to rich biodiversity. Elephants are important ecosystem engineers. They make pathways in dense forested habitat that allow passage for other animals.

Do elephants feel pain?
-----------------------

Nociceptors have also been found in elephants along with the central nervous system structures thought to be implicated in the processing and interpretation of pain information. We thus infer that elephants are capable of experiencing pain as are humans.

What do elephant rumbles mean?
------------------------------

Elephants use soft rumbling sounds to alert the extended family to Maasai warriors, or they may emit a commanding roar or trumpet-blast to intimidate a lion lurking in the bush.

What do elephants do when they sense danger?
--------------------------------------------

Elephants can literally smell danger, according to a study that shows they can sniff out whether humans are friends or foes. When the elephants sniff a Masai, they turn up their trunks to orient themselves to the smell and then stampede away until they reach cover in the tall grass.

Will elephant die without tusk?
-------------------------------

Not all elephants die when their tusks are removed. It all depends on the factors of how the tusks are removed in the first place. Domesticated elephants are treated if there appears to be some infection after the removal of tusks. In the wild elephants need their tusks to dug up water during the dry season.

Do elephants feel love?
-----------------------

Elephants, the largest land animals on the planet, are among the most exuberantly expressive of creatures. Joy, anger, grief, compassion, love; the finest emotions reside within these hulking masses. Through years of research, scientists have found that elephants are capable of complex thought and deep feeling.

What’s it called when an elephant makes a noise?
------------------------------------------------

Elephants make a variety of sounds including rumbling and trumpeting. Trumpeting is created by pushing air through the trunk and is used when an elephant is highly stimulated. Rumbling is the regular form of communication with each other.

How does the elephant respond to external stimuli?
--------------------------------------------------

Dendrites. The stimuli is immediately sent up to the brain via the Stimulus Neuron passing along a relay neuron in the brain where the message is delivered. External Stimuli External Stimuli is anything that affects the body from the outside for e.g touch and heat. If the elephant was to stand on a very hot surface.

How are stimulus and response similar in animals?
-------------------------------------------------

Similarities Between Stimulus and Response 1 Stimulus and response are two aspects of the nervous system of the animal body. Also, plants respond to stimulus through hormones. 2 Both give sensitivity to an organism. 3 Also, both help to maintain homeostasis or a constant internal environment in animals.

What makes up the nervous system of an elephant?
------------------------------------------------

The African Elephant. There are two main parts that make up the Nervous System which is the Peripheral and Central Nervous Systems. These systems respond to internal and external stimuli using the three neurons stimulus, motor and relay neurons.

What makes an elephant respond to an alarm call?
------------------------------------------------

In general, increasingly threatening stimuli elicited alarm calls with increases in F0 and in formant locations, and increasing numbers of these acoustic cues in vocal stimuli elicited increased vigilance and flight behavior in listening elephants.
