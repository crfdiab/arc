How long would it take to reach our closest star?
-------------------------------------------------

Since it would take at least 6,300 years to reach the closest star to our sun, enough men and women to produce many genetically healthy generations would need to make the trip. If humans are ever to colonize the galaxy, we will need to make the trip to a nearby star with a habitable planet.

Can astronauts travel to the nearest star?
------------------------------------------

NASA has a whole area on its website about faster-than-light travel, in which it basically says … it’s not currently possible. The Alpha Centauri system. It’s at least a double system, maybe a triple system, but we see it with the eye as just one star. At 4.3 light-years away, this star system is the closest to Earth.

Will we ever reach another star?
--------------------------------

The technology required to travel between galaxies is far beyond humanity’s present capabilities, and currently only the subject of speculation, hypothesis, and science fiction. However, theoretically speaking, there is nothing to conclusively indicate that intergalactic travel is impossible.

How long would it take to get to the nearest habitable planet?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, the nearest exoplanet to Earth (alpha Centauri B b) is 4.24 light years away. Given the physical limit of the speed of light that means that the absolute minimum travel time (in the reference frame of the traveler) is 4.24 years, but achieving velocities close to that of light is way beyond our means.

Can a star be touched?
----------------------

4 Answers. Surprisingly, yes, for some of them. Small, old stars can be at room temperature ex: WISE 1828+2650, so you could touch the surface without getting burned. Any star you can see in the sky with the naked eye, however, would be hot enough to destroy your body instantaneously if you came anywhere near them.

Can we reach star?
------------------

At a recent conference, rocket scientists from NASA, the U.S. Air Force and academia doused humanity’s interstellar dreams in cold reality. The calculations show that, even using the most theoretical of technologies, reaching the nearest star in a human lifetime is nearly impossible.

How long would it take to travel to the nearest star?
-----------------------------------------------------

In short, at a maximum velocity of 56,000 km/h, Deep Space 1 would take over 81,000 years to traverse the 4.24 light years between Earth and Proxima Centauri. To put that time-scale into perspective, that would be over 2,700 human generations.

Is it possible for humans to reach another star?
------------------------------------------------

The nearest star is 4 light years away. That means that light, traveling at 300,000 kilometers per second would still need 4 YEARS to reach the nearest star. The fastest spacecraft ever launched by humans would need tens of thousands of years to make that trip. But science fiction encourages us to think it’s possible.

Which is the fastest spacecraft to reach another star?
------------------------------------------------------

The fastest spacecraft we’ve ever launched is New Horizons. It’s currently traveling at 14 kilometres per second. It would take this peppy little probevette 100,000 years to get to the nearest star. This is mostly due to our lack of reality shattering propulsion. Our best propellant option is an ion engine, used by NASA’s Dawn spacecraft.

How long would it take a spacecraft to reach Proxima Centauri?
--------------------------------------------------------------

NASA Helios 2 space probe in 1976 then became the fastest man-made object ever made after reaching a maximum velocity of over 150,000 miles/hr (240,000 km/hr), using the orbital speed attained from the gravitational pull of the Sun. At this rate, it would take 19,000 to 76,000 Years to reach Proxima Centauri,…
