What can you tell me about the history of Kansas?
-------------------------------------------------

Historical Maps of Kansas are a great resource to help learn about a place at a particular point in time. Kansas Maps are vital historical evidence but must be interpreted cautiously and carefully. The Kansas State Historical Society’s volume 8 of Transactions contains a good map series, which clearly shows how Kansas counties were developed.
