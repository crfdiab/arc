What is the main reason pioneers traveled in wagon trains?

How long does it take for a wagon train to travel?
--------------------------------------------------

The front wheels were usually smaller than those at the back. The wagon train would travel at around two miles an hour. This enabled the emigrants to average ten miles a day. With good weather the 2,000 mile journey from Missouri to California and Oregon would take about five months. However, heavy rains would increase this by several weeks.

When did the first wagon train arrive in Oregon?
------------------------------------------------

What kind of wheels did the wagon train have?
---------------------------------------------

The four wheels of the wagon were made of wood (strengthened with iron). The front wheels were usually smaller than those at the back. The wagon train would travel at around two miles an hour.

Why was the wagon train not very comfortable?

A few fortunate few had horses but normally those were the wealthy and the hired guide and scouts. Wagon trains were also not very comfortable because of the amount of noise. Imagine the continual drone of clomping feet and the hollow sound of the wagons bouncing through the ruts.
