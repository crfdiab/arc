Who was the mysterious lady in the story the sphinx without a secret?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Lady Alroy  
The Sphinx without the secret in this story is Lady Alroy, who appears to have created a fantasy world of suspicion and mystery (much like the mystery surrounding the Great Sphinx), even though she had no real secrets to speak of.

What is the theme of the Sphinx Without a secret?
-------------------------------------------------

In “The Sphinx Without a Secret,” Wilde explores the theme of love. This is shown from the beginning of the story when the narrator meets with his friend Lord Murchison, a man who is “troubled” by his amorous feelings for Lady Alroy.

Why does Lord Murchison say threw open the door rather than opened the door?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4\) Throwing open the door is more theatrical than merely opening the door. It creates the impression of surprise and drama when Lady Alroy enters. Lord Murchison may also use the phrase to make his story sound more exciting. 5) When you catch sight of someone, you do see them, but not usually very long or very clearly.

When was the last time the Great Sphinx was eroded?
---------------------------------------------------

Supporters of this hypothesis point to extensive erosion of the limestone near the top of the Great Sphinx, arguing that the last time the region experienced enough rainfall in the region to cause this type of erosion on limestone was 7000 B.C.

How is the configuration file executed in Sphinx?
-------------------------------------------------

The configuration file is executed as Python code at build time (using execfile (), and with the current directory set to its containing directory), and therefore can execute arbitrarily complex code. Sphinx then reads simple names from the file’s namespace as its configuration. Important points to note:

What did the Sphinx look like in its prime?
-------------------------------------------

Yet there are clues to what the face looked like in its prime. Archaeological excavations in the early 19th century found pieces of its carved stone beard and a royal cobra emblem from its headdress. Residues of red pigment are still visible on the face, leading researchers to conclude that at some point, the Sphinx’s entire visage was painted red.

How old is the Great Sphinx of Giza?
------------------------------------

How old is the Great Sphinx? The Great Sphinx of Giza, a giant limestone figure with the body of a lion and the head of a man wearing a pharaoh’s headdress, is the national symbol of Egypt—both ancient and modern—and one of the world’s most famous monuments.
