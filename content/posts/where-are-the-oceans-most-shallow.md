Where are the oceans most shallow?
----------------------------------

The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world’s five major oceans.

Which ocean has the shallowest basin?
-------------------------------------

Arctic Ocean basin  
This video focuses on the Arctic Ocean basin and is taken from the interactive online game, My Ocean. Test your ocean knowledge and learn about the different basins of the world ocean by playing here. The Arctic Ocean is the smallest, shallowest, and coldest part of the ocean.

Are there shallow areas in the ocean?
-------------------------------------

Yes the terrain under the ocean is just as varied as it is on dry land. There are deep canyons and mountain ranges, planes and rolling hills, volcanos and vents. Of the five major oceans of the world, the Arctic Ocean ranks as the smallest and shallowest.

Where are some shallow areas of the ocean?
------------------------------------------

I can recall several surveys where we encountered very shallow offshore features in otherwise deep water. To the north of Mitrofania Island, out near the Aleutian Chain, there is a rock with a least depth of 20-ft in the middle of 23-ftm (140-ft) of water and a rock awash with 28-ftm (160-ft) surrounding it.

What’s the average depth of the North Sea?
------------------------------------------

Dogger Bank in the North Sea, is a moraine (a big pile of rock, gravel and sand left behind by glaciers). The average depth of the ocean is about 3.7 kilometers (2.3 miles). 8% of the ocean is the continental shelves, the underwater part of the ever-drifting continents.

When was the southern ocean delimited from the Indian Ocean?
------------------------------------------------------------

Geography. The borders of the Indian Ocean, as delineated by the International Hydrographic Organization in 1953 included the Southern Ocean but not the marginal seas along the northern rim, but in 2000 the IHO delimited the Southern Ocean separately, which removed waters south of 60°S from the Indian Ocean,…

Which is the largest brackish sea in the world?
-----------------------------------------------

Modern inland seas. This 1827 map of Australia depicts a ‘Great River’ and a ‘Supposed Sea’ that both proved nonexistent. The Baltic Sea is a brackish inland sea, arguably the largest body of brackish water in the world (other possibilities include the White Sea and Black Sea).
