Where is Sancerre made?
-----------------------

Loire valley  
Sancerre is a French wine Appellation d’origine contrôlée (AOC) for wine produced in the area of Sancerre in the eastern part of the Loire valley, southeast of Orléans. Almost all of the appellation lies on the left bank of the Loire, opposite Pouilly-Fumé.

What country is Sancerre wine from?
-----------------------------------

France’s  
Most of the appellation (wine producing area) of Sancerre lies on the left bank of France’s Loire river, opposite Pouilly-Fumé. It’s well known for producing flinty Sauvignon Blancs, which pair wonderfully with trout, salmon, herbs and goat’s cheese, but is also home to Pinot Noir reds and rosés.

Is Sancerre only from France?
-----------------------------

Sancerre is a small wine district in central France, famous for its crisp, aromatic white wines made from Sauvignon Blanc. It is also known for its high-quality goat cheeses, which are an excellent match for the local wine.

Is Sancerre the same as Sauvignon Blanc?
----------------------------------------

Sancerre is today a Sauvignon Blanc stronghold in France’s Loire Valley, known for delicious dry white wines that can marry citrus, green fruit and grassy flavours with beautiful texture and refreshing acidity.

Is Sancerre expensive?
----------------------

The most expensive Sancerres I’ve seen cost well under $100 a bottle at retail. Indeed, Sancerre is physically closer to Chablis than many other regions in the Loire Valley, and the best of its wines have much in common with those flinty white Burgundies.

    The most expensive Sancerres I’ve seen cost well under $100 a bottle at retail. Yet the soils of Sancerre can be quite similar to the soils of Champagne and Burgundy, especially the Burgundy region of Chablis.

    Is Sancerre a Burgundy?
    -----------------------
    
    A small appellation of the upper Loire Valley in France, Sancerre is famous for producing crisp, dry Sauvignon Blanc wines. Located at the eastern end of the Loire Valley, hundreds of kilometres from the ocean, Sancerre is closer to Burgundy than to the other Loire regions in the west.
    
    Do you chill Sancerre?
    ----------------------
    
    Sancerre should be served chilled, but not too cold, which puts a damper on aromas and flavors. If you have a bottle in the fridge, take it out for a half-hour before drinking.
    
    Where is the town of Sancerre in France?
    ----------------------------------------
    
    Sancerre is a medieval hilltop town (ville), commune and canton in the Cher department of central France overlooking the Loire River. It is noted for its wine.
    
    Where does the title of Sancerre wine come from?
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    BTW: No other region that uses Sauvignon Blanc grapes can claim the title of Sancerre on their wine. The label only originates from the specific Sancerre region in France. For more information on French regions, their AOC designations, and geographical protections… check out this article!
    
    Why is Sancerre located on the Atlantic Coast?
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    The distance between Sancerre (highlighted in pink within yellow box) and the Atlantic coast diminishes the maritime influence on the region and gives it more of a continental climate.
    
    Which is the best wine in Sancerre France?
    ------------------------------------------
    
    Pascal Jolivet is one of the top vineyards in the area. They produce rich ripe fruit that creates strong tropical flavors like guava, passionfruit, melon, and lime. The fruit is pure and there is very little “green” or grassy about this wine. The distinct minerality of Loire touches in the back palate with hints of chalk.
