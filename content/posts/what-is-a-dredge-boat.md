Why is dredging bad?

What are the two main types of dredgers?
----------------------------------------

There are two main types of hydraulic dredges – hopper dredges and cutter suction dredges.

How does a cutter suction dredger work?
---------------------------------------

A cutter suction dredger cuts hard soil into fragments with a rotating cutter head. The material is sucked up by dredge pumps and discharged to a deposit area through pipelines across sea and land. During the dredging works, a spud is lowered in the seabed to secure the vessel.

What is clamshell dredging?
