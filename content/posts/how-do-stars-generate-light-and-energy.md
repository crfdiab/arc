How do stars generate light and energy?
---------------------------------------

Stars generate energy through nuclear fusion. Here’s an easy explanation about how the process works. Stars spend most of their lives repetitively compressing two hydrogen atoms into a single helium atom – plus a lot of energy, which is released as light and heat.

How do stars produce light How do stars produce elements?
---------------------------------------------------------

Stars create new elements in their cores by squeezing elements together in a process called nuclear fusion. First, stars fuse hydrogen atoms into helium. Helium atoms then fuse to create beryllium, and so on, until fusion in the star’s core has created every element up to iron.

How much energy does a star produce?
------------------------------------

This annihilation energy amounts to 1.02 megaelectron volts (MeV), which accords well with Einstein’s equation E = mc2 (where m is the mass of the two particles, c the velocity of light, and E the liberated energy).

What process causes the stars to produce energy?
------------------------------------------------

nuclear fusion  
In deep inside the core of stars, enough protons collide into each other with enough speed and form a helium nucleus, generating a tremendous amount of energy at the same time. This process is called nuclear fusion.

Which star produces the most energy?
------------------------------------

There is another star called the Pistol Star. It is in our neighborhood, the Milky Way galaxy. Although the sun is extremely powerful, this star is even much more so. It produces 10 million times more energy than the sun and gives off as much energy in six seconds as the sun does in an entire year.

Do stars get their light from the sun?
--------------------------------------

Stars make their own light, just like our sun (the sun is a star — the closest star to Earth). They reflect the light of the sun in the same way our moon reflects sunlight. SpaceKids on SPACE.com provides simple, straightforward answers to really big cosmic questions. See more SpaceKids questions.

What star gives off the most energy?

Which is bigger Sun or star?
----------------------------

Although the Sun appears larger to us than any other star, there are many stars which are much larger. The Sun appears so large compared to the other stars because it is so much closer to us than any other star. The Sun is just an average sized star. Mu Cephi – about 1500 times the size of our sun.

How are stars able to create their own light?
---------------------------------------------

Stars create light through nuclear fusion reactions. Hydrogen gets turned into helium in this process which releases an energy in the form of gamma rays. Gamma rays weaken when they get to the surface of a star and become visible light photons i.e. light that you and I can see.

What makes up the light in the night sky?
-----------------------------------------

Look into the night sky and you’ll see stars in all directions shining and twinkling in the dark. But what is the light that we’re seeing, and how does it get all the way from the distant stars to here? All stars are just vast balls of hot plasma. They’re made up of mostly hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other elements.

What kind of light does a star have?
------------------------------------

Not only do stars have their own “light”, so does everything else in the Universe which has a solid surface — that is, if you extend the concept of “light” to mean electromagnetic radiation. And the peak wavelength of this radiation depends very precisely on the temperature of the solid surface.

How does the Sun produce heat and light energy?
-----------------------------------------------

This is where atoms of hydrogen are fused into atoms of helium (through several stages). This reaction releases an enormous amount of energy in the form of gamma rays Using our sun as an example, nuclear fusion (primarily hydrogen into helium) in the core of the sun produces the heat where the temperature is roughly 15 million K.
