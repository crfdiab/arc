Does Mt St Helens have a magma chamber?
---------------------------------------

Helens, the most active volcano in the Pacific Northwest. The emerging picture includes a giant magma chamber, between 5 and 12 kilometers below the surface, and a second, even larger one, between 12 and 40 kilometers below the surface.

What type of lava erupted from Mount St. Helens?
------------------------------------------------

Mt. St. Helens typically generates explosive pyroclastic eruptions, in contrast to many other Cascade volcanoes, such as Mt. Rainier which typically generates relatively non-explosive eruptions of lava.

Is Mt St Helens a lava dome?
----------------------------

Beginning in October 1980, episodic eruptions built a new lava dome that reached nearly 305 m (1000 ft) above the crater floor. Between 1980 and 1986, Mount St. Helens’ dome grew in different ways. From 1980 through 1982 the dome grew in periodic extrusions of stubby lava flows, called lobes.

Was there lava in Mount St. Helens?
-----------------------------------

The early history of Mount St. Helens is poorly known, and the initial stage, called Ape Canyon, covers a long timespan. During this stage, lava domes erupted just west of the present volcano in two distinct periods—one from 275 to 250 thousand years ago (ka) and a second from 160 to 35 ka.

What kind of magma did Mount St Helens have?
--------------------------------------------

The evidence indicates that interaction between more silicic (dacite) magma batches with more mafic (basalt to andesite) magma increased from the earliest to most recent stages of Mount St. Helens volcanism.

Is the Mount St Helens volcano still active?
--------------------------------------------

Recent analysis of Mount St. Helens shows that the volcano remains active and has accumulated additional magma, but there are no signs of an impending eruption, the U.S. Geological Survey said in a statement on Wednesday. Since the end of the 2004-2008 eruptions at Mount St.

Which is more explosive Mount St Helens or Kilauea?
---------------------------------------------------

Mount St. Helens’ magma is inherently more explosive than the Kīlauea magma: it has more water in it than Kīlauea magma, and is delivered to the surface at a higher pressure because of higher magma viscosity. So Mount St. Helens tends to have explosive eruptions and Kīlaueaa eruptions are generally non-explosive.

How big is the dome of Mount St Helens?
---------------------------------------

It is 96 miles (154 km) south of Seattle and 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Portland, Oregon. Mount St. Helens: How does it look like??? Mount St Helens is dome-shaped volcano. Since the viscosity of the magma is high, the lava that flows out of the vent of the dome can only cover a small distance before solidifying.
