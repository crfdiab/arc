What is needed for precipitation to occur?
------------------------------------------

For precipitation to happen, first tiny water droplets must condense on even tinier dust, salt, or smoke particles, which act as a nucleus. If enough collisions occur to produce a droplet with a fall velocity which exceeds the cloud updraft speed, then it will fall out of the cloud as precipitation.

How does precipitation occur in Class 7?
----------------------------------------

Precipitation happens in clouds when water vapour condenses into bigger droplets. These droplets fall down on earth when they become too heavy. -Colder clouds, like the kind found in hilly higher altitudes, results in frozen water droplets and this leads to snowfall.

What is precipitation question answer?
--------------------------------------

Precipitation is water that falls back to the surface of the earth upon condensing in the atmosphere. In other words, any form of water which falls, whether it is in liquid or frozen form, falls as precipitation only.

How does precipitation occur and what determines the type?
----------------------------------------------------------

Precipitation can only occur after condensation, which is when water turns from a gas to a liquid. The atmosphere is filled with water vapor, which is water in a gaseous state. Sometimes this water vapor cools and builds up on dust particles in the atmosphere, forming a cloud. What are the main forms of precipitation?

What kind of precipitation falls from the sky?
----------------------------------------------

Precipitation is any type of water that forms in the Earth’s atmosphere and then drops onto the surface of the Earth. Water vapor, droplets of water suspended in the air, builds up in the Earth’s atmosphere before precipitating. Rain is liquid precipitation: water falling from the sky.

Why does condensed water not fall as precipitation?
---------------------------------------------------

Most of the condensed water in clouds does not fall as precipitation because their fall speed is not large enough to overcome updrafts which support the clouds. For precipitation to happen, first tiny water droplets must condense on even tinier dust, salt, or smoke particles, which act as a nucleus.

What happens to the water in the air when it rains?
---------------------------------------------------

Precipitation. The air is full of water, even if you can’t see it. Higher in the sky where it is colder than at the land surface, invisible water vapor condenses into tiny liquid water droplets—clouds. When the cloud droplets combine to form heavier cloud drops which can no longer “float” in the surrounding air, it can start to rain, snow, and hail
