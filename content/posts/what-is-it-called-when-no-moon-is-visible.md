What is it called when no moon is visible?
------------------------------------------

In astronomy, the new moon is the first lunar phase, when the Moon and Sun have the same ecliptic longitude. At this phase, the lunar disk is not visible to the unaided eye, but its presence may be detected because it occults stars behind it.

Why is there no visible moon?
-----------------------------

Some of the other reasons that you may not see the moon is due to it’s position in the sky and the moon’s phase. The Moon orbits the Earth. As it sits in space, through the majority of its orbit, half of it is lit on one side, and the other side is dark. Half is facing towards the Sun, and the other half is not.

When is the Moon not visible in the sky?
----------------------------------------

The night is usually quite dark during these periods. For example, if sunset is at 7:00 pm, the Moon might not rise over the horizon until around 12-midnight, five days after the Full Moon. To a person looking in the sky at 9:00 pm, there is no Moon visible in the sky. The graphic below shows the phase of the Moon today.

What does it mean when it is a moonless night?
----------------------------------------------

A moonless night is, as you suspect, a night in which the Moon does not appear visible in the sky. This happens once per month, when the Moon is near the Sun. Due to the proximity of the Moon and the Sun in the sky, at that time the Moon is the smallest sliver possible, and therefore not a full moon. This is because it is actually…

Why is the Moon not a full moon?
--------------------------------

Due to the proximity of the Moon and the Sun in the sky, at that time the Moon is the smallest sliver possible, and therefore not a full moon. This is because it is actually the Sun that illuminates the Moon, and when the Sun and the Moon are in the same direction in the sky we are seeing the non-illuminated side of the Moon.

Can you see a full moon during the day?
---------------------------------------

The moon is visible in daylight nearly every day, the exceptions being close to new moon, when the moon is too close to the sun to be visible, and close to full moon when it is only visible at night. The best times in the month to see the moon in daylight are close to first and last quarter, when the moon is 90 degrees away from the sun in the sky.
