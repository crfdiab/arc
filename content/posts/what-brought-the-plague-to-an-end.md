What brought the plague to an end?
----------------------------------

In 1666 the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the centre of London, but also helped to kill off some of the black rats and fleas that carried the plague bacillus. Bubonic Plague was known as the Black Death and had been known in England for centuries.

How long did it take for the plague to end?
-------------------------------------------

Black Death—The Invention of Quarantine From the Swiss manuscript the Toggenburg Bible, 1411. The plague never really went away, and when it returned 800 years later, it killed with reckless abandon. The Black Death, which hit Europe in 1347, claimed an astonishing 200 million lives in just four years.

Why did the Black Death kill so many?
-------------------------------------

The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic.

How does bubonic plague kill you?
---------------------------------

Summary: Yersinia pestis, the deadly bacterium that causes bubonic plague, kills by cutting off a cell’s ability to communicate with other immune system cells needed to fight off the bacterial invasion.

Was the black death the first pandemic?
---------------------------------------

The Black Death was probably the earliest recorded pandemic. It took around four years to make its way along the Silk Road from the Steppes of Central Asia, via Crimea, to the Western most parts of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. In Europe alone it wiped out an estimated one to two thirds of the population.

Why did plague masks have beaks?
--------------------------------

The typical mask had glass openings for the eyes and a curved beak shaped like a bird’s beak with straps that held the beak in front of the doctor’s nose. The purpose of the mask was to keep away bad smells, known as miasma, which were thought to be the principal cause of the disease.

How fast did the black plague kill?
-----------------------------------

Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days.

How did the plague and Black Death end?
---------------------------------------

A: There are several factors that are thought to have ended the plague, or Black Death, but the most important appears to be measures taken by people to quarantine themselves.

When was the last plague outbreak in England?
---------------------------------------------

The last major plague outbreak, though, occurred in London between 1665 and 1666. Live Science writes that some historians credit advancements in medicine for stemming the spread of the plague.

How did the plague evolve into the present day?
-----------------------------------------------

The plague never completely kicked the bucket, but it’s a shell of its hellish self. Live Science explains that the present-day plague evolved from a less virulent species of bacteria, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, which often causes “mild stomach infections.”

Are there any hospitals left from the Black Plague?
---------------------------------------------------

Via the Science Museum of London, hospitals erected to combat the plague stayed in operation until the 1900s. The plague never completely kicked the bucket, but it’s a shell of its hellish self.
