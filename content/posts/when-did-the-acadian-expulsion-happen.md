When did the Acadian expulsion happen?
--------------------------------------

10 August 1755  
Expulsion of the Acadians/Start dates

Who started the Acadian expulsion?
----------------------------------

Governor Charles Lawrence  
British Governor Charles Lawrence and the Nova Scotia Council decided on July 28, 1755 to deport the Acadians. Although Grand Prï¿½ to this day is the most well known symbol of the expulsion, it actually began at Fort Beausï¿½jour on August 11. About 6,000 Acadians were forcibly removed from their colonies.

Why did Acadians migrate to Louisiana?
--------------------------------------

The Spanish offered the Acadians lowlands along the Mississippi River in order to block British expansion from the east. Some would have preferred Western Louisiana, where many of their families and friends had settled. In addition, that land was more suitable to mixed crops of agriculture.

Why is the Acadian expulsion significant?
-----------------------------------------

The Expulsion (1755–1764) occurred during the French and Indian War (the North American theatre of the Seven Years’ War) and was part of the British military campaign against New France. The British first deported Acadians to the Thirteen Colonies, and after 1758, transported additional Acadians to Britain and France.

What happened in the Acadian deportation?
-----------------------------------------

In the first wave of the expulsion, Acadians were deported to other British North American colonies. During the second wave, they were deported to Britain and France, and from there a significant number migrated to Spanish Louisiana, where “Acadians” eventually became “Cajuns”.

How many Acadians are there today?
----------------------------------

500,000 Acadians  
There are at least 500,000 Acadians living in the country, the majority of them residing in Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland.

When did the expulsion of the Acadians begin?
---------------------------------------------

In 1754, The Great Expulsion, Le Grand Dérangement, began with the systematic removal of between ten to twenty thousand Acadians from Nova Scotia by the British Empire.

What did the British do to the Acadians?
----------------------------------------

After the Conquest, Acadia was no longer considered an independent settlement of France; it would become a French speaking British settlement, strictly ruled by British authority. In 1754, The Great Expulsion, Le Grand Dérangement, began with the systematic removal of between ten to twenty thousand Acadians from Nova Scotia by the British Empire.

Why did William Lawrence expel the Acadians?
--------------------------------------------

As the Governor of Nova Scotia, Lawrence had the right to take up action to ensure that British territory was protected. The Acadians were living under British jurisdiction and it was prudent for the governor to ensure that his subjects were loyal to him.

When did the Acadians leave Prince Edward Island?
-------------------------------------------------

The Acadian Day of Remembrance pays homage to the more than 3,000 Acadians who were deported from Îsle Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island) in 1758. Known as The Great Upheaval among Acadians, the 1758 deportation of Acadians from Prince Edward Island resulted in the deaths of more than half of those deported.
