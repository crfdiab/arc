Are impact craters hard to find?
--------------------------------

Why does the Moon have so many craters while Earth has so few? On Earth, impact craters are harder to recognize because of weathering and erosion of its surface. The Moon lacks water, an atmosphere, and tectonic activity, three forces that erode Earth’s surface and erase all but the most recent impacts.

How fast is an asteroid impact?
-------------------------------

Asteroids, the most common type of impactor, slam into the Earth at an average velocity of 18 km/s. Short-period comet impacts with the Earth are less common, but have higher impact velocities averaging 30 km/s. Even rarer are impacts from long-period comets at higher impact velocities that average 53 km/s.

What is the youngest impact crater on Earth?
--------------------------------------------

Hiawatha crater  
New Geology study using a set of unusual methods shows that the Hiawatha crater discovered in 2018 is the youngest of the 25 large impact structures known on Earth.

How big an asteroid would destroy the earth?
--------------------------------------------

10 to 14 km  
From the amount and distribution of iridium present in the 65-million-year-old “iridium layer”, the Alvarez team later estimated that an asteroid of 10 to 14 km (6 to 9 mi) must have collided with Earth.

What is the fastest asteroid ever recorded?
-------------------------------------------

The study also determined that the meteorite entered Earth’s atmosphere at a speed of 28.6 kilometres per second, the fastest ever recorded. Chemical and physical analysis revealed Sutter’s Mill to be a relatively rare ‘carbonaceous chondrite’ type of meteorite, and in a near-pristine state.

How long does it take for an impact crater to form?
---------------------------------------------------

Crater formation. The fastest impacts occur at about 72 km/s in the “worst case” scenario in which an object in a retrograde near-parabolic orbit hits Earth. The median impact velocity on Earth is about 20 km/s.

How big was the impact crater on the Moon?
------------------------------------------

The Kara Crater is said to have originally measured closer to 75 miles across immediately following the time of impact, but has been eroded heavily over time. The Ust-Kara site, which lies directly offshore, was initially thought to have been a separate impact site.

How big is the Kara crater in miles?
------------------------------------

The Kara Crater is said to have originally measured closer to 75 miles across immediately following the time of impact, but has been eroded heavily over time. The Ust-Kara site, which lies directly offshore, was initially thought to have been a separate impact site. However, it is now believed to have been a part of the main Kara impact structure.

How many impact craters are there in the Solar System?
------------------------------------------------------

Note that the rate of impact cratering in the outer Solar System could be different from the inner Solar System. Although Earth’s active surface processes quickly destroy the impact record, about 190 terrestrial impact craters have been identified.
