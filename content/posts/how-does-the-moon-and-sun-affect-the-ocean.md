How does the moon and sun affect the ocean?
-------------------------------------------

When the earth, moon, and Sun line up—which happens at times of full moon or new moon—the lunar and solar tides reinforce each other, leading to more extreme tides, called spring tides. When the gravitational pull of the Sun and moon are combined, you get more extreme high and low tides.

How does the moon affect oceans?
--------------------------------

The combination of Earth’s gravity and the gravitational pull of the moon creates a phenomenon called tidal force, which is what causes our ocean tides to change. Tidal force is actually the moon’s average gravitational pull over the entire Earth subtracted from the moon’s gravitational pull in a specific location.

Why the moon and sun affect the Earth’s ocean tides?
----------------------------------------------------

Around each new moon and full moon, the sun, Earth, and moon arrange themselves more or less along a line in space. Then the pull on the tides increases, because the gravity of the sun reinforces the moon’s gravity. In fact, the height of the average solar tide is about 50 percent of the average lunar tide.

What role does the moon and sun play in causing sea levels to change daily?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The moon’s gravitational pull on the Earth and the Earth’s rotational force are the two main factors that cause high and low tides. The side of the Earth closest to the Moon experiences the Moon’s pull the strongest, and this causes the seas to rise, creating high tides.

Why does Moon attract water?
----------------------------

The gravitational attraction between the Earth and the moon is strongest on the side of the Earth that happens to be facing the moon, simply because it is closer. This attraction causes the water on this “near side” of Earth to be pulled toward the moon.

How does the moon affect the Earth and Sun?
-------------------------------------------

And during both full and new moons, when the earth, moon and sun all line up, their gravitational powers combined cause these more extreme tides called “spring tides”. During the 1 st and 3 rd quarter moons, when we see the lunar and solar gravitational pulls combat each other, we see smaller tides known as “neap tides”.

How does the moon affect our ocean tides?
-----------------------------------------

One thing we know for sure about this celestial body—it plays a huge role by influencing our beautiful ocean tides. The combination of Earth’s gravity and the gravitational pull of the moon creates a phenomenon called tidal force, which is what causes our ocean tides to change. How does this actually work?

Are there any effects of the Moon on humans?
--------------------------------------------

The possibility that humans could be affected by the moon’s cycles isn’t entirely groundless. — including reef coral, sea-dwelling worms, and some fish — have reproductive cycles that are roughly timed to lunar cycles. Still, not many studies link the moon to human behavior and health conditions.

How are long form waves caused by the Moon?
-------------------------------------------

However, this isn’t because of just the Moon itself, but instead is due to the interaction of the Moon and the Sun. Long-form waves, which we know as tides when they hit the shore, are caused by the gravitational pull of other celestial bodies, most notably the Moon (because it’s closest) and the Sun (because it’s very large and heavy).
