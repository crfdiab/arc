Is there a way to stop tornadoes?
---------------------------------

It is not possible to stop a tornado. Tornadoes are nature’s most powerful force. They contain 6 times the energy density of a hurricane. For comparison, a hydrogen bomb contains the same amount of energy as a hurricane.

Who do you call when you spot a tornado?
----------------------------------------

In short, call 911 for something you see that has caused a life-threatening emergency. Notice the past participle here: For tornadoes, high winds and hail, call the NWS if you see it happen, not 911.

The following weather signs may mean that a tornado is approaching: .

What happens to a business after a tornado?
