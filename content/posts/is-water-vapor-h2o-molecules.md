Is water vapor H2O molecules?
-----------------------------

The third state of water is the gaseous state (water vapor). In this state, water molecules move very rapidly and are not bound together. Although we cannot see water in its gaseous state, we can feel it in the air on a hot, humid day. Commonly, water boils at a temperature of 100°C or 212°F, forming water vapor.

Are water vapor molecules?
--------------------------

Water molecules in the vapor form are arranged more randomly than in liquid water. As condensation occurs and liquid water forms from the vapor, the water molecules become more organized and heat is released into the atmosphere as a result.

What is a water vapor called?
-----------------------------

(Also called aqueous vapor, moisture.)

What are the molecules like in water vapor?
-------------------------------------------

In gaseous water, also called water vapor, the molecules are very much farther apart than in the liquid and they move around rapidly with only occasional interactions. Since there are very few molecules per unit volume, the density is considerably lower than for the liquid and solid.

How do water molecules behave?
------------------------------

Water behaves differently from most other chemical compounds. In almost all substances the atoms and molecules move closer together as they get colder. Its oxygen atom (O) and the two hydrogen atoms (H) are asymmetrically arranged. This produces a dipole, a molecule with one negatively and one positively charged end.

Is water vapor ideal gas?
-------------------------

At elevated temperatures, and low pressures, water can be gaseous; in fact, water always has a vapour pressure. The answer to your question is thus NO. Sometimes, the behaviour of water vapour can approximate the behaviour of an ideal gas.

Which is true of the vapor pressure of water?
---------------------------------------------

With any body of water, water molecules are always both evaporating and condensing. The vapor pressure of water is the pressure at which the gas phase is in equilibrium with the liquid phase.

How are water molecules arranged in the vapor form?
---------------------------------------------------

What’s the difference between liquid water and steam water?
-----------------------------------------------------------

There is no difference between a molecule of liquid water and a molecule of steam water. These water molecules are in different states but, it doesn’t mean that these molecules have any difference. So, in different states these molecules have different arrangement.

How many atoms are in a water molecule?
---------------------------------------

Strangely, the water molecules in liquids are more densely packed than those in the solid or vapor state. One water molecule is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
