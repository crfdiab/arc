Where is the Great Salt Lake in Utah?
-------------------------------------

The Utah Climate Center provides prediction of the Great Salt Lake’s annual lake level. This forecast uses central tropical Pacific Ocean temperature, watershed precipitation, tree-ring data of 750+ years, and the lake level itself. A railroad line – the Lucin Cutoff – runs across the lake, crossing the southern end of Promontory Peninsula.

What was the eastern part of Utah covered in?
---------------------------------------------
