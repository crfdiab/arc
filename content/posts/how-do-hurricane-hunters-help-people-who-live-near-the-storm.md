How do hurricane hunters help people who live near the storm?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Hurricane Hunters — a team within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) sometimes assisted by a team from the US Air Force Reserves — fly right into the storms, slicing, diving, and weaving through “howling winds, blinding rain and violent updrafts and downdrafts” to gather information.

Which was better Spitfire or Hurricane?
---------------------------------------

The Spitfire and Bf 109E were well-matched in speed and agility, and both were somewhat faster than the Hurricane. The Hurricane had a higher seating position, which gave the pilot a better view over the nose than the Spitfire.

Why are Hurricane Hunters important to Hurricane Research?
----------------------------------------------------------

Data collected during hurricanes by these high-flying meteorological stations help forecasters make accurate predictions during a hurricane and help hurricane researchers achieve a better understanding of storm processes, improving their forecast models.

How does a hurricane hunter fly into a storm?
---------------------------------------------

Most people avoid severe storms. Hurricane hunters fly precise routes into them. “We’ll generally fly into the eye, then out and then circle back and do it again,” explains Major Devon Meistr, a pilot of one of the propeller driver C-130s that are part of the U.S. Air Force Reserves Hurricane Hunter Squadron.

When does the National Hurricane Center send the Hurricane Hunters?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When a tropical weather system is beginning to form, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) will send the Hurricane Hunters to investigate the occurrence of counterclockwise (cyclonic) rotation and confirm the presence of a “closed system”.

What does the NOAA Hurricane Hunter radar do?
---------------------------------------------

The jet’s mission covers thousands of square miles surrounding the hurricane, gathering vital high-altitude data with GPS dropwindsondes and tail Doppler radar that enables forecasters to maps the steering currents that influence the movement of hurricanes.
