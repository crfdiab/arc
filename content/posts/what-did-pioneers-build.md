What did pioneers build?
------------------------

When the pioneers first arrived at their new land, one of the first things they needed to do was build a house where the family could live. In areas where there were plenty of trees, they would build log cabins. Log cabins required few building resources, just trees and an axe or saw.

How did settlers build a log cabin?
-----------------------------------

By stacking tree trunks one on top of another and overlapping the logs at the corners, people made the “log cabin”. They developed interlocking corners by notching the logs at the ends, resulting in strong structures that were easier to make weather-tight by inserting moss or other soft material into the joints.

What were frontier homes made of?
---------------------------------

“Chinking” consisted of jamming sticks and wood chips into the gaps, and then filling in the remaining space with a homemade cement of earth, sand, and water. Fireplaces were built of stone, and frequently featured stick-and-mud chimneys.

How did the pioneers make fire?
-------------------------------

Fire was kept by burying wood in ashes. Sometimes this method failed. Sometimes two pieces of wood were rubbed together until they blazed (a hard job). Some times gunpowder was mixed with fine kindling and a spark from a flint rock and steele made a new start.

What did the pioneers use instead of glass?
-------------------------------------------

So, what did the early pioneers use? Many settlers fit their windows with panes made of cloth, greased paper, and even sheets of mica.

What are the problems with log homes?
-------------------------------------

The most common log home problems are:

- Moisture problems in log homes. Rain, snow, humidity, and damp places all cause moisture damage.
- Insects and critter problems in log homes. Insects and critters tend to love our log homes just as much as we do.
- UV Ray damage in log homes.

How many rooms did an 1860’s log cabin have?
--------------------------------------------

The cabin would have one room and usually 12 to 16 feet square space. It had one door and usually no windows. The spaces between the logs would be filled with chinking materials such as, small stones, wood, corn cobs, clay, or cloth.

How did frontier people survive?
--------------------------------

The daily life of people living on the frontier was filled with hard work and difficulties. Once a farmer cleared the land, built a cabin and a barn, and planted his crops, he still had a lot of chores that needed to be done each day. In order to survive, the entire family needed to work.

What did the early settlers use log cabins for?
-----------------------------------------------

Settlers often built log cabins as temporary homes to live in while constructing larger, permanent houses; then they either demolished the log structures or usedoften used them as outbuildings, such as barns or chicken coops.

What kind of culture do settlers come from?
-------------------------------------------

Settlers are generally from a sedentary culture, as opposed to nomadic peoples who may move settlements seasonally, within traditional territories. Settlement usually relies on dispossession of already established populations within the contested area, and because of this it can be a very violent process.

Who was the first person to settle an area?
-------------------------------------------

In this usage, pioneers are usually among the first to an area, whereas settlers can arrive after first settlement and join others in the process of human settlement. This correlates with the work of military pioneers who were tasked with construction of camps before the main body of troops would arrive at the designated campsite.

Where did the settlers come from in Syria?
------------------------------------------

Syria – In recent times, Arab settlers have also moved in large numbers to ethnic minority areas, such as northeast Syria. Women and children experience violence in these highly dangerous areas because of the conflict. Many natives face displacement when new settlements are established.
