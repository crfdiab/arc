Do caddisflies live in polluted water?
--------------------------------------

While most caddisflies are considered sensitive to environmental stress, some caddisflies are less sensitive. Some actually thrive on slightly polluted conditions with elevated nutrients, because it causes more periphyton, a favorite food, to grow.

Do caddisflies indicate good water quality?
-------------------------------------------

Caddisflies are a good indicator of water quality because they live within a diversity of habitats. However, some types that are widespread, can tolerate pollution and environmental stress”.

What do caddisflies do for the environment?
-------------------------------------------

Caddisfly larvae represent an important ecological component of nutrient processing and energy flow in lakes and rivers and provide a food source for a variety of aquatic predators, such as trout and other fish (Resh and Rosenberg, 1984; Johansson, 1991; Wiggins, 1996a).

Are caddisfly larvae sensitive to pollution?
--------------------------------------------

Water Quality Indicator: Lepidostoma larvae are very intolerant of nutrient pollution and are good water quality indicators. Habitat &amp; Habits: The often-green larvae live in cool streams and crawl about actively through stream rocks and debris.

Do caddisflies bite?
--------------------

They don’t have mouth parts so they can’t bite or feed on landscape plants, and in that respect, they are harmless. But in large numbers, they are annoying and a nuisance. In the meantime, look on the plus side: large numbers of caddisflies indicate a healthy river!

How long does a Caddisfly live?
-------------------------------

The adults typically live for about a month, just long enough to mate and lay eggs. Adults usually stay close to the water, and adult females lay eggs on or in the water (females of some species will dive underwater to lay eggs). Some females will lay up to 800 eggs.

What macroinvertebrates indicate bad water quality?
---------------------------------------------------

Macroinvertebrates indicate excellent, good, fair, or poor water quality. Stoneflies and mayflies can indicate excellent water quality; and leeches, midges and blackflies indicate poor water quality.

Do fish eat caddisflies?
------------------------

Caddisfly larvae are a link in the aquatic food chain, bridging the gap between the various organic matterials they eat, and the fish that eat them. The adults are eaten by birds, reptiles, and other land predators.

How do you kill caddisflies naturally?
--------------------------------------

How Do I Get Rid of Caddisflies?

1. Monitor – Turning lights off when adult caddisflies are flying.
2. Relocate – Installing lights away from buildings, if possible.
3. Replace – Replacing standard incandescent and fluorescent lights with sodium vapor lights that are less attractive to insects.

How do you kill caddisfly larvae?
---------------------------------

Why do caddisfly larvae move around in tubes?
---------------------------------------------

The larvae move around inside the tubes and this helps maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.

How long does a caddisfly live in water?
----------------------------------------

Caddisfly larvae build protective cases around their bodies. Photo via Flickr. Larva – The egg hatches and becomes a larva that lives in water for one to two years. Caddisfly larvae are unique because they will build a case around their soft bodies to protect them. The case is made up of pebbles, sand or plant matter.

What kind of net does a caddisfly use?
--------------------------------------

Different families of caddisflies use silk to produce different types of ‘capture nets’ to collect food from the environment. Water flows into the net, which captures food particles from the water. The larvae can then graze on the captured food in the net. They may also be selective feeders, feeding on the more nutritious foods.

What happens to the caddisfly pupae after sealing the case?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Pupae After sealing the case, the final instar of the caddisfly larvae becomes stiff, shorter, and broader, losing flexibility in the head and abdomen. This process occurs under water, and is influenced by many factors, including water temperature, light exposure, altitude, and the availability of nutrients.
