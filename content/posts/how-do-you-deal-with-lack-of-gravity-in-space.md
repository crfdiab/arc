How do you deal with lack of gravity in space?
----------------------------------------------

Astronauts typically have an allocated exercise period of two hours a day in space to counteract these effects; this time not only includes cardiovascular exercise and weight-lifting, but also time to change clothes and set up or take down equipment.

How can we maintain gravity in space?
-------------------------------------

Dave: In space, it is possible to create “artificial gravity” by spinning your spacecraft or space station. When the station spins, centrifugal force acts to pull the inhabitants to the outside. This process could be used to simulate gravity.

How does NASA deal with low gravity?
------------------------------------

NASA uses airplanes to create microgravity for short periods of time. The airplane does this by flying in up-and-down parabolas. At the top of the parabola, people and objects inside the airplane are in free fall for about 20-30 seconds at a time.

Can gravity be controlled in space?
-----------------------------------

The better news is that there is no science that says that gravity control is impossible. First, we do know that gravity and electromagnetism are linked phenomena. Another way is through new theories from quantum mechanics that link gravity and inertia to something called “vacuum fluctuations.”

How long can you survive in space without a suit?
-------------------------------------------------

15 seconds  
Astronauts need space suits to stay alive. You could only last 15 seconds without a spacesuit — you’d die of asphyxiation or you’ll freeze. If there’s any air left in your lungs, they will rupture.

Can gravity be altered?
-----------------------

Altered gravity has several physiological effects on the human body. In altered gravity, there is a consequent toll on their physiology. For example, studies have shown that weightlessness makes watering plants difficult, causing waterlogging and preventing growth. In humans, microgravity can also have adverse effects.

How can we avoid the effects of zero gravity?
---------------------------------------------

The best way to avoid the effects of zero gravity is to create artificial gravity. To date, scientists have managed to create gravity only under laboratory conditions, using strong magnetic fields above permitted safety levels, which of course is not practical in space travel.

How are astronauts trained to deal with zero gravity?
-----------------------------------------------------

Astronauts are trained for the conditions by practicing in a reduced-gravity aircraft that flies in a special parabolic route. The training helps them function in space but does not prevent the harmful effects of zero gravity on health.

How does the International Space Station reduce the effects of zero gravity?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To reduce and avoid some of the negative effects of the lack of gravity on the muscles, especially the heart muscle, the International Space Station is equipped with sports apparatus used for resistance training.

How are spacecraft designed to deal with microgravity?
------------------------------------------------------

Spacecraft also must be designed to take microgravity into account. During spacewalks, for example, astronauts require extra handholds and footholds on the exterior of their spacecraft so that they can anchor themselves and not float away. (Astronauts also attach to them in tethers in case they lose their grip.)
