Where do recyclables go after they are collected?
-------------------------------------------------

‘Co-mingled’ collections where all your recyclables are put into one compartment on the lorry before being taken to a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) and sorted. How is it recycled? After the materials have been collected and sorted, they are sent for re-processing.

How is waste sorted at a recycling plant?
-----------------------------------------

The waste bags are opened and the waste is put onto a conveyor belt and moved into a processing area. First, the waste will go into a pre-sort area, where any items that can’t be recycled are removed, and then the materials move into an area where they can be sorted automatically by machines, or manually by workers.

Why is it important for recycling to be sorted?
-----------------------------------------------

We are recycling more than ever, but for recycling to be effective, it needs to be sorted appropriately to maximise the amount of materials that can be recovered. New technologies are being implemented constantly to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the waste sorting process.

How are mixed recycling materials collected and sorted?
-------------------------------------------------------

After the materials have been collected and sorted, they are sent for re-processing. More information on how mixed recycling is sorted can be found in the materials recovery facility (MRF) video. Once collected and sorted, recycled materials become valuable commodities in the worldwide market.

After recyclables are collected, they get transported by trucks to recycling plants called materials recovery facilities (MRFs). In MRFs, giant piles of mixed materials are fed through machines that separate them out into different categories and bundle them to be shipped off to processing plants.

What’s the best way to make a recycling machine?
------------------------------------------------

Put the paper pieces in a cup with the paper clips. Cover the top of the cup with your hand so nothing falls out, and shake the cup to mix them. Dump the mixed paper clips and paper pieces into a pile onto your worksurface. Try separating them manually.

How is sorting done in a recycling machine?
-------------------------------------------

In MRFs, giant piles of mixed materials are fed through machines that separate them out into different categories and bundle them to be shipped off to processing plants. Much of the sorting is done automatically by machines that make clever use of different properties of the materials.

Why are plastic bags not allowed in recycling machines?
-------------------------------------------------------

Magnets, for example, can attract metal objects, and blowing air can separate lighter paper and cardboard from heavier objects such as glass bottles and metal cans. This process is not without its downsides. Plastic bags can clog sorting machines, which is why they typically cannot be included in single-stream recycling.
