How many countries have launched space probes?
----------------------------------------------

The space agencies of the USSR (now Russia, Ukraine and others), the United States, the European Union, Japan, China, India, and Israel have collectively launched probes to several planets and moons of the Solar System, as well as to a number of asteroids and comets. Approximately 15 missions are currently operational.

Where is Pioneer probe now?
---------------------------

Pioneer 10 is currently in the direction of the constellation Taurus. If left undisturbed, Pioneer 10 and its sister craft Pioneer 11 will join the two Voyager spacecraft and the New Horizons spacecraft in leaving the Solar System to wander the interstellar medium.

Who got to Mars first?
----------------------

The first successful flyby of Mars was on 14–15 July 1965, by NASA’s Mariner 4. On November 14, 1971, Mariner 9 became the first space probe to orbit another planet when it entered into orbit around Mars.

What is Mars Arabs?
-------------------

The Hope Mars Mission, also called the Emirates Mars Mission, is the first uncrewed, interplanetary satellite spearheaded by the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

How many missions have NASA launched into space?
------------------------------------------------

Ever since the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created over half a century ago, they’ve launched hundreds of missions into space. From probes that have touched the outer reaches of our solar system to manned capsules that pushed the limits of technology, they’ve done it all.

How is the Huygen probe attached to the orbiter?
------------------------------------------------

The Probe Support Equipment (PSE) remained attached to the orbiting spacecraft. The support equipment included the electronics necessary to track the probe, recover the data gathered during its descent and process and deliver the data to the orbiter. The data was then transmitted or downlinked from the orbiter to Earth.

What was the mission of the Voyager spacecraft?
-----------------------------------------------

Launched in late summer 1977 aboard a Titan-Centaur rocket, the Voyager probes were destined for a rendezvous with the four unexplored giant planets in the outer solar system: Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus. The probes explored these planets over the course of a decade.

How did NASA contribute to the Space Station?
---------------------------------------------

NASA space shuttles were a key element in the construction of the station, lifting astronauts and construction parts from around the world into orbit to work on the station. The first crews started arriving in the early 2000s. NASA also played a crucial role in the research and development of parts and construction techniques here on Earth.
