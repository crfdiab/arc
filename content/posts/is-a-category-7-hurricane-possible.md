Is a category 7 hurricane possible?
-----------------------------------

A category 7 hurricane would have winds of at least 210 – 215 mph. Only one hurricane in world history would rank as a category 7: Hurricane Patricia of 2015, which peaked with 215-mph sustained winds off the Pacific coast of Mexico.

What are the 7 categories of hurricanes?
----------------------------------------

Types Of Hurricanes

- Tropical Storm. Winds 39-73 mph.
- Category 1 Hurricane. winds 74-95 mph (64-82 kt)
- Category 2 Hurricane. winds 96-110 mph (83-95 kt)
- Category 3 Hurricane. winds 111-130 mph (96-113 kt)
- Category 4 Hurricane. winds 131-155 mph (114-135 kt)
- Category 5 Hurricane. winds 156 mph and up (135+ kt) Is a Category 8 hurricane possible?
    -----------------------------------
    
    A Category 8 hurricane would likely have a storm surge of at least 30–40 feet and would be caused by little to no wind shear, and perfect water temperature for a tropical cyclone of this magnitude to form, especially in the Atlantic Ocean.
    
    Has a hurricane ever split into two?
    ------------------------------------
    
    It happened again on June 18, 1959 with Tropical Storm Beulah and Hurricane 3, which overlapped with each other for eight hours. The most recent occurrence was between Sept. 5 and Sept. 6, 2002, with Tropical Storm Fay and Tropical Depression Edouard when they took a dip together in warm Gulf waters for 18 hours.
    
    What are the different categories of a hurricane?
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    Hurricanes are measured on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which runs from Category 1 up to Category 5.
    
    How are hurricanes classified according to the SSHWS?
    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    Hurricanes are capable of causing massive losses to life and property and hence the need to classify these tropical storms became necessary. Hurricanes are classified according to the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). According to this scale, there are 5 categories of hurricanes: Category 1 to Category 5,…
    
    What kind of damage can a Category 1 hurricane do?
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    It’s important to note that Category 1 and Category 2 storms are still very dangerous and can cause loss of life. Category 1 hurricanes have sustained wind speeds of 74-95 mph. These are very dangerous winds that can produce some damage. Well-constructed frame homes could have damage to roof, shingles, vinyl siding, and gutters.
    
    What are the highest winds in a Category 5 hurricane?
    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    In a Category 5 hurricane, the highest category hurricane, winds are 157 mph or higher. People, livestock and pets can be in danger from flying debris, even indoors.
