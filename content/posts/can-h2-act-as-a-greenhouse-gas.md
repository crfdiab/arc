Can H2 act as a greenhouse gas?
-------------------------------

Hydrogen (H2) is similar to carbon monoxide in that it acts as an indirect greenhouse gas through its effect on hydroxyl (OH) radicals. By reducing the levels of OH in the atmosphere, hydrogen increases the lifetime of some direct greenhouse gases, such as methane.

Why SO2 is not a greenhouse gas?
--------------------------------

Sulfur dioxide is not considered a direct greenhouse gas because sulfur dioxide does not absorb and trap infrared radiation as it attempts to return…

Does burning hydrogen contribute to global warming?
---------------------------------------------------

Emissions of hydrogen lead to increased burdens of methane and ozone and hence to an increase in global warming. Therefore, hydrogen can be considered as an indirect greenhouse gas with the potential to increase global warming.

Which is the main greenhouse gas?
---------------------------------

Carbon dioxide  
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities.

Does no2 cause global warming?
------------------------------

Nitrous oxide enhances the greenhouse effect just as carbon dioxide does by capturing reradiated infrared radiation from the Earth’s surface and subsequently warming the troposphere (lower atmosphere).

What are the disadvantages of hydrogen?
---------------------------------------

Some of the disadvantages of hydrogen energy include:

- Hydrogen Energy is Expensive.
- Storage Complications.
- It’s Not the Safest Source of Energy.
- Tricky to Move Around.
- It is Dependent on Fossil fuels.
- Hydrogen Energy Cannot Sustain the Population. Can hydrogen destroy the ozone layer?
    -------------------------------------
    
    The leaked hydrogen from fuel cells could cause as much as a 10% decrease in the ozone layer if it accumulates in the atmosphere, new research shows. This in turn would result in a cooler lower stratosphere and disturbance of ozone chemistry. …
    
    Which is the most abundantly found greenhouse gas?
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    Explanation: Water vapor is around 0.4% of the atmosphere which is the highest of any greenhouse gas.
