What are 3 objects that are non-living?
---------------------------------------

Some examples of non-living things include rocks, water, weather, climate, and natural events such as rockfalls or earthquakes. Living things are defined by a set of characteristics including the ability to reproduce, grow, move, breathe, adapt or respond to their environment.

What are nonliving parts?
-------------------------

In biology and ecology, abiotic components or abiotic factors are non-living chemical and physical parts of the environment that affect living organisms and the functioning of ecosystems.

Is Sun living or NonLiving?
---------------------------

For young students things are ‘living’ if they move or grow; for example, the sun, wind, clouds and lightning are considered living because they change and move.

Is an apple alive or dead?
--------------------------

After apples are picked, they are still alive – they continue to carry out the chemical processes of a living plant, more or less, as they take in oxygen, create energy, and get closer and closer to ripeness.

What has never been alive?
--------------------------

We now know that leaves, twigs, shells and feathers are all dead because they used to be living, but rocks, plastic bottle lids and stones have never been alive because they don’t need food, water and air to survive!

What makes the desert a non living thing?
-----------------------------------------

The sand that gives the desert a distinct look is an abiotic factor. The extreme heat that makes the desert perfect for cold-blooded animals like rattlesnakes is also a non-living thing. One abiotic factor that separates the desert from most other ecosystems is its relative lack of rainfall.

Which is an abiotic component of a desert ecosystem?
----------------------------------------------------

Abiotic components are those nonliving things, especially environmental elements that exist within the ecosystem, such as water, dirt and air. In a desert ecosystem, much of what designates the system as desert is nonliving.

What kind of things are found in the desert?
--------------------------------------------

As with most other ecosystems, rocks and other such chunks of solid earth are found all over the desert. Certain types of semi-precious materials such as quartz can be found among the rocks in desert ecosystems.

What makes the desert ecosystem difficult to live in?
-----------------------------------------------------

1 Rock. The heat of the desert often makes it difficult for living creatures, both plant and animal, to survive, leaving vast tracts of bare land. 2 Sand. Made up of fine rock particles, sand is likely the most identifiable element of the desert ecosystem. 3 Mountains. 4 Water. 5 Air. …
