How was oil discovered in Alaska?
---------------------------------

Swanson River Oil Discovery The remote well — drilled by Richfield Oil Corporation, a predecessor of ARCO — had produced 900 barrels of oil a day. This was the first significant oil discovery in Alaska since 1902. “Bishop and Arnett drilled a successful oil well at Swanson River, in the northwest Kenai Peninsula.

Where and when was oil first discovered in Alaska?
--------------------------------------------------

The Atlantic Richfield Company and Humble Oil and Refining Company announce the discovery of oil on the North Slope of Alaska at Prudhoe Bay.

Where are the oil refineries in Alaska located?
-----------------------------------------------

Alaska is among the lowest one-fifth of states in total demand for finished petroleum products. The state has five operating refineries. Two of them, in the Prudhoe Bay region, supply fuel to crude oil drilling operations. Motor gasoline demand is primarily met by a refinery in Kenai.

Why is Alaska a good place to drill for oil?
--------------------------------------------

In recent years, Alaska has experienced warmer temperatures for longer periods of time during the year. Warmer temperatures reduce the amount of time energy companies can explore for onshore oil, because ice roads and drilling pads can be used only during the coldest months of the year, when the frozen land is less damaged by heavy equipment.

Is there oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge?
----------------------------------------------------

However, in 2017, oil exploration and drilling was no longer prohibited in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), located in northeastern Alaska.

How big are the natural gas reserves in Alaska?
