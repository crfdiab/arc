What types of clouds can produce precipitation?
-----------------------------------------------

Almost all rain is produced from low-level clouds. Stratus clouds produce steady rains, and cumulus clouds produce intense, stormy precipitation.

Does a cloud produce precipitation?
-----------------------------------

What causes rain? Clouds are made of water droplets. Within a cloud, water droplets condense onto one another, causing the droplets to grow. When these water droplets get too heavy to stay suspended in the cloud, they fall to Earth as rain.

What is a storm cloud called?
-----------------------------

More commonly known as thunderclouds, cumulonimbus is the only cloud type that can produce hail, thunder and lightning.

What are the types of clouds that produce rain?
-----------------------------------------------

The clouds that produce rain are cumulonimbus and nimbostratus clouds. Stratus clouds can produce precipitation in the form of drizzle. At any time around the world, there is rain falling in the form of sprinkles, light showers, moderate rain, heavy downpours, and thunderstorms.

What kind of rain does a stratus cloud produce?
-----------------------------------------------

Stratus clouds can produce drizzle, but when they produce heavy rain, they are called nimbostratus clouds. Rain and Nimbostratus Clouds Nimbostratus clouds form a uniformly dark gray, rainy looking cloudy layer associated with continuously falling precipitation. They generally produce precipitation that is light to moderate in intensity.

What kind of precipitation is a nimbostratus cloud?
---------------------------------------------------

Precipitation: May produce light showers. Altostratus: middle level grey sheet, thinner layer allows sun to appear as through ground glass. Precipitation: rain or snow. Nimbostratus: thicker, darker and lower based sheet. Precipitation: heavier intensity rain or snow.

Which is the best description of a middle level cloud?
------------------------------------------------------

Altocumulus: middle level layered cloud, rippled elements, generally white with some shading. Precipitation: May produce light showers. Altostratus: middle level grey sheet, thinner layer allows sun to appear as through ground glass. Precipitation: rain or snow.
