How were sea cliffs formed?
---------------------------

Cliffs are usually formed because of processes called erosion and weathering. On sea cliffs, sediment becomes part of the seafloor and is washed away with the waves. On inland cliffs, sediment is often carried away by rivers or winds. Larger rocks broken off by sediment are called scree or talus.

What is a sea cliff and how is it formed?
-----------------------------------------

Sea cliffs are steep faces of rock and soil that are formed by destructive waves. Waves crashing against the coastline erode until a notch is formed. The erosion of this notch undercuts the ground above it until it becomes unstable and collapses. This process repeats itself and the sea cliff will continue to retreat.

How did the water help make the cliffs?
---------------------------------------

Another common way cliffs are formed is through the action of water and weathering, which erodes rock over time. Especially common in cliffs occurring along coasts or large lakes, the repeated lapping of water against rocks as waves gradually wears the rock down, which can form cliffs over many thousands of years.

How are cliffs formed and how are they formed?
----------------------------------------------

Cliffs are usually formed because of processes called erosion and weathering. Weathering happens when natural events, like wind or rain, break up pieces of rock. In coastal areas, strong winds and powerful waves break off soft or grainy rocks from hardier rocks. The harder rocks are left as cliffs.

How does erosion take place on sea cliffs?
------------------------------------------

Erosion is the process of transportation of this sediment. On sea cliffs, sediment becomes part of the seafloor and is washed away with the waves. On inland cliffs, sediment is often carried away by rivers or winds. Larger rocks broken off by sediment are called scree or talus.

What kind of landforms are formed by erosion?
---------------------------------------------

Mountains, hills, plains, plateaus, beaches, sea stacks and canyons all qualify as landforms since they’ve been formed by nature over time. The whole process of landform formation is known as erosion. Erosion is the wearing away of the earth’s surface by the action of natural forces, for example, water, wind and glacial ice.

How are coastal features formed by sea waves?
---------------------------------------------

Significant coastal features formed due to ma­rine erosion by sea waves and other currents and solution processes include cliffs, coves, caves, in­dented coastline, stacks, chimneys, arch, inlets, wave-cut platforms etc.
