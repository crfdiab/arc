Will we ever colonize Antarctica?
---------------------------------

Future conditions. Though the environment of Antarctica is too harsh for permanent human settlement to be worthwhile, conditions may become better in the future. Even farming and crop growing could be possible in some of the most northerly areas of Antarctica.

Why is there so much research in Antarctica?
--------------------------------------------

There are a number of reasons why scientists go to Antarctica to study various aspects of science, they include but are not limited to: It has a unique ecosystem which is worthy of study in itself, in particular how Antarctic organisms of all kinds are able to withstand the deep cold and not just survive, but thrive.

Why is it important for scientists to study Antarctica?
-------------------------------------------------------

Scientists want to keep it that way. Studying Antarctica is critical to combating climate change, but most scientists can’t travel to the continent this upcoming season.

Where do scientists live and work in Antarctica?
------------------------------------------------

United States scientists arrive by C17 plane at a temporary sea-ice airfield near McMurdo Station, Antarctica. It’s the world’s only seasonal sea ice airfield, and is used only when the ice is firm enough to support aircraft. Still, the ice flexes unde… 1. There are a few different ways to live and work in Antarctica.

When is the best time to study Antarctica?
------------------------------------------

Studying Antarctica is critical to combating climate change, but most scientists can’t travel to the continent this upcoming season. The busy summer season in Antarctica begins in October and runs through February, when thousands of scientists from dozens of countries usually pack into the continent’s remote research stations.

How many research stations are there in Antarctica?
---------------------------------------------------

There are a few different ways to live and work in Antarctica. Antarctica’s home to 75 individual research stations, and they’re run by 30 countries. Of these science bases, 45 are actively operating year-round — although most are accessible for only a three-month window every year due to weather conditions.
