Why mountains are covered with snow?
------------------------------------

As you climb a mountain to a higher altitude (height), the atmosphere gets thinner and thinner. This is because air pressure decreases with altitude. Even though warm air rises, as it does so the rising air expands and cools. More moisture means more rain and, at the very top of a mountain, more snow.

How do you drive down a mountain in the snow?
---------------------------------------------

The way to drive downhill on packed snow depends on whether you have ABS. If so, start at the top of the hill as slowly as possible. Leave your auto in normal drive gear and use light, steady pressure on the brake pedal to stay at a safe speed.

When driving down a mountain you should never shift to?
-------------------------------------------------------

Don’t go down a mountain road any faster than you can go up it. Don’t use your brakes to hold your downhill speed. Down shift to S or L – the only time you should step on your brake pedal is to slow while you are shifting down to a lower gear. Resist the temptation of zooming down a hill.

What gear should I use for uphill?
----------------------------------

While going uphill, use the D1, D2, or D3 gears to maintain higher RPMs and give your vehicle more climbing power and speed. Note: Most automatic vehicles have at least a D1 and D2 gear, while some models also have a D3 gear.

Where to go to see snow covered mountains?
------------------------------------------

You can travel up to the Klein Matterhorn (Little Matterhorn) by cable car and walk on the snow up there all year so that would be a good place to get wonderful photographs of the tops of the Alps (the view is just spectacular up there) as well as to be on the snow.

What does it mean when you dream of a snow top?
-----------------------------------------------

In fact, in these dreams, snow top is very important. For example, if the mountain is covered with snow in the dream, it is a good sign. It predicts the fulfillment of the goal, even though all the difficulties and obstacles. After seeing such dream, a person should accumulate all strength, and in any case do not stop there.

What’s the best way to travel to the Snowy Mountains?
-----------------------------------------------------

There are a number of ways to travel to the snowy mountains, with three airports servicing the region, as well as frequent bus and train services. If you’re driving, plan ahead and bring snow chains, as it’s a legal requirement to carry these in 2WD vehicles in Kosciuszko National Park between June and October.

What should I wear to the Snowy Mountains?
------------------------------------------

It is important you are wearing the right gear at the snow, so make a checklist before you leave. For beginners, the best option is to hire your skis, boots, snowboards and outer clothing in Cooma or Jindabyne, or at the resort.
