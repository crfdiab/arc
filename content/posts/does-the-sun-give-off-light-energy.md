Does the sun give off light energy?
-----------------------------------

All of the energy from the Sun that reaches the Earth arrives as solar radiation, part of a large collection of energy called the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. Solar radiation includes visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared, radio waves, X-rays, and gamma rays. Radiation is one way to transfer heat.

Is the sun chemical or light energy?
------------------------------------

The electromagnetic energy of sunlight is converted to chemical energy in the chlorophyll-containing cells of photosynthetic organisms. In eukaryotic cells these reactions occur in the organelle known as the chloroplast. In the chloroplast, chlorophyll is the pigment that absorbs the sunlight.

What part of the sun gives off light?
-------------------------------------

photosphere  
The lowest layer of the sun’s atmosphere is the photosphere. It is about 300 miles (500 kilometers) thick. This layer is where the sun’s energy is released as light.

What gives off light in our solar system?
-----------------------------------------

​Almost all of the light in space comes from stars. In our region of space, known as the Solar System, the Sun emits most of the light, but that’s because the Sun is a star and that’s what stars do – they emit light!

Which is longer on Venus a day or a year?
-----------------------------------------

1\. A day on Venus is longer than a year. It takes Venus longer to rotate once on its axis than to complete one orbit of the Sun. That’s 243 Earth days to rotate once – the longest rotation of any planet in the Solar System – and only 224.7 Earth days to complete one orbit of the Sun.

Where does the energy from the sun come from?
---------------------------------------------

The light and heat energy that we receive from the star that we call the Sun is the result of nuclear fusion taking place deep within the confines of that body.

What kind of galaxy is the Milky Way?
-------------------------------------

The Milky Way is ours. This type of galaxy is shaped like an oval, has fewer stars than the others, is older, and has most stars in the center. These are small round objects that orbit a planet. These are round objects that are smaller than planets, bigger than moons, and found in the orbit around the sun.

Where is the Sun located in the Solar System?
---------------------------------------------

A light year is the distance light travels in one year, which is equal to 5,878,499,810,000 miles or 9,460,528,400,000 kilometers. The Sun, and everything that orbits it, is located in the Milky Way galaxy. More specifically, our Sun is in a spiral arm called the Orion Spur that extends outward from the Sagittarius arm.

How does the gravity of the Sun hold the Solar System together?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything – from the biggest planets to the smallest particles of debris – in its orbit. The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and auroras.
