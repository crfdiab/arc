When did the Wisconsin glaciation start and end?
------------------------------------------------

Wisconsin Glacial Stage, most recent major division of Pleistocene time and deposits in North America that began between about 100,000 and 75,000 years ago and ended about 11,000 years ago. It was named for rock deposits studied in the state of Wisconsin.

When was the Wisconsin glaciation?
----------------------------------

The Wisconsin glaciation extended from approximately 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, between the Sangamonian Stage and the current interglacial, the Holocene. The maximum ice extent occurred approximately 25,000–21,000 years ago during the last glacial maximum, also known as the Late Wisconsin in North America.

What did the glaciers do to Wisconsin?
--------------------------------------

Glaciers created the conditions for what much of how we know and experience the state today. Ice movement churned the ground and created rich soil, which is key to our farming heritage. In fact, without the last glaciation, Wisconsin might not be the dairy state!

How thick were the glaciers over Wisconsin?
-------------------------------------------

1 to 2 miles  
Continental glaciers covered thousands of square miles of the earth’s surface and were 1 to 2 miles thick in some areas.

What caused the driftless area in Wisconsin?
--------------------------------------------

The region’s distinctive terrain is due to its having been bypassed by the last continental glacier. The term “driftless” indicates a lack of glacial drift, the deposits of silt, gravel, and rock that retreating glaciers leave behind.

Did glaciers go through Wisconsin?
----------------------------------

The last cycle of climate cooling and glacier expansion in North America is known as the Wisconsin Glaciation. About 100,000 years ago, the climate cooled again and a glacier, the Laurentide Ice Sheet, spread across the continent. It took another 7,000 years before the ice finally retreated from northern Wisconsin.

Where did the glaciers stop in Wisconsin?
-----------------------------------------

The Lake Michigan Lobe of the glacier flowed down the Lake Michigan lowland to central Indiana and Illinois. The Langlade, Wisconsin Valley, Chippewa, and Superior Lobes covered northern Wisconsin.

Is Spring Green a town?
-----------------------

The Town of Spring Green was first established in 1850. The Town of Spring Green is located in southwestern Sauk County, with the Wisconsin River forming its southern boundary. The river is a dominant feature in the town with the southern 2/3 lying within the Wisconsin River valley.

The Wisconsin glaciation extended from approximately 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, between the Sangamonian Stage and the current interglacial, the Holocene. The maximum ice extent occurred approximately 25,000–21,000 years ago during the last glacial maximum , also known as the Late Wisconsin in North America.

What was the latest phase of the glaciation?
--------------------------------------------

Timeline of glaciation. The Late Cenozoic Ice Age began 34 million years ago, its latest phase being the Quaternary glaciation, in progress since 2.58 million years ago. Within ice ages, there exist periods of more severe glacial conditions and more temperate referred to as glacial periods and interglacial periods, respectively.

How long did the ice age last in Wisconsin?
-------------------------------------------

It expanded for 13,500 years before temperatures warmed again and it began to melt back. It took another 7,000 years before the ice finally retreated from northern Wisconsin. We’ve mapped the movement of the ice, in roughly 500-year increments, from its initial arrival in Wisconsin to its final departure.

How are the Great Lakes and Wisconsin glacial stages related?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Wisconsin Glacial Stage. The Great Lakes are remnants of glacial lakes that bordered the vast continental ice sheets. Much material was eroded from various areas, only to be deposited elsewhere. The rich soils of the Great Plains, for example, are largely derived from the silt deposited by streams of glacial meltwater.
