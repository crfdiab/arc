Are temperature and humidity correlated?
----------------------------------------

As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, and its relative humidity decreases. When temperatures drop, relative humidity increases. Temperature therefore directly relates to the amount of moisture the atmosphere can hold.

What happens to water vapor when temperature decreases?
-------------------------------------------------------

For condensation to occur, molecules of water vapor in the air need to be moving slow enough so that when they collide with other molecules of water vapor, they attract to become liquid water. As the temperature decreases, the rate of condensation increases.

Is humidity inversely proportional to temperature?
--------------------------------------------------

Relative humidity is inversely proportional to temperature. As relative humidity increases, less water evaporates from the surface of the skin, and evaporative cooling decreases. As a result, apparent temperature is greater than air temperature as relative humidity rises.

Does water evaporate faster in hot or cold temperatures?
--------------------------------------------------------

Evaporation rates are higher at higher temperatures because as temperature increases, the amount of energy necessary for evaporation decreases. In sunny, warm weather the loss of water by evaporation is greater than in cloudy and cool weather.

At what temperature does water evaporate?
-----------------------------------------

212° F  
Heat (energy) is necessary for evaporation to occur. Energy is used to break the bonds that hold water molecules together, which is why water easily evaporates at the boiling point (212° F, 100° C) but evaporates much more slowly at the freezing point.

Does humidity drop with temperature?
------------------------------------

As noted by the Sciencing.com website, “As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, and its relative humidity decreases. When temperatures drop, relative humidity increases.”

How is water vapor related to surface temperature?
--------------------------------------------------

AIRS is the first instrument to distinguish differences in the amount of water vapor at all altitudes within the troposphere. Using data from AIRS, the team observed how atmospheric water vapor reacted to shifts in surface temperatures between 2003 and 2008.

Do you know the relation between temperature and vapour pressure?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thus, it is necessary to understand vapour pressure and in particular the gaseous nature of water vapour.

How is vapor pressure related to water potential?
-------------------------------------------------

As stated earlier, we obtain water potential by observations of vapor pressure. The changes in temperature measured are actually minute. The relation between vapor pressure and temperature is as follows:

Is the saturation pressure of water vapor always the same?
----------------------------------------------------------

Water vapor is almost always present in the surrounding air. Note! – the equations below is for pure water vapor – not moist air. Saturation Pressure of Water Vapor The maximum saturation pressure of the water vapor in moist air varies with the temperature of the air vapor mixture and can be expressed as:
