When was the first liquid-fueled rocket invented?
-------------------------------------------------

March 16, 1926  
On March 16, 1926, Robert Goddard successfully launched the first liquid-fueled rocket in Auburn, Mass. The first-of-its-kind rocket reached an altitude of 41 feet, lasted 2 seconds and averaged about 60 miles per hour.

What was the first liquid fuel rocket?
--------------------------------------

Ninety years ago today, on March 16, 1926, Robert H. Goddard (1882-1945) launched the world’s first liquid-propellant rocket. His rickety contraption, with its combustion chamber and nozzle on top, burned for 20 seconds before consuming enough liquid oxygen and gasoline to lift itself off the launch rack.

How long did it take to build the first liquid-fueled rocket?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Liquid rockets provide more thrust per unit of fuel and allow engineers to specify how long the rocket will stay lit. It took 17 years of work for Goddard’s first launch to fly.

When was the first rocket made in Europe?
-----------------------------------------

Gunpowder-propelled military rockets appeared in Europe sometime in the 13th century, and in the 19th century British engineers made several important advances in early rocket science.
