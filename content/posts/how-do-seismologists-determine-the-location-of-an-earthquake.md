How do seismologists determine the location of an earthquake?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Seismologists use the difference in arrival time between P and S waves to calculate the distance between the earthquake source and the recording instrument (seismograph).

How do seismologists study earthquakes?
---------------------------------------

Seismologists study earthquakes and their results, like tsunamis, and landslides. They may also monitor active volcanoes for tremors and signs of an impending eruption. They use seismographs and computer equipment to collect and analyze data on seismic events.

What is the place where an earthquake starts called?
----------------------------------------------------

hypocenter  
The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows.

How are earthquakes detected by the British Geological Survey?
--------------------------------------------------------------

BGS ©UKRI. All rights reserved. Seismometers allow us to detect and measure earthquakes by converting vibrations due to seismic waves into electrical signals, which we can then display as seismograms on a computer screen. Seismologists study earthquakes and can use this data to determine where, and how big, a particular earthquake is.

How does a seismologist determine the location of an earthquake?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The procedure is simple to state: guess a location, depth and origin time; compare the predicted arrival times of the wave from your guessed location with the observed times at each station; then move the location a little in the direction that reduces the difference between the observed and calculated times.

How are scientists able to learn about earthquakes?
---------------------------------------------------

Scientists can learn a lot about earthquakes by studying how they move ground. Using seismic activity, we can learn where an earthquake originated as well as how strong it was. In this video lesson, you will learn about seismic activity and how it relates to our understanding of earthquakes. What Is Seismic Activity?

Can a meteorologist see the Earth during an earthquake?
-------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, Earth is not transparent and we can’t just see or photograph the earthquake disturbance like meteorologists can photograph clouds. When an earthquake occurs, it generates an expanding wavefront from the earthquake hypocenter at a speed of several kilometers per second.
