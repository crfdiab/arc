What kept the Earth warm?
-------------------------

the greenhouse effect  
Earth’s atmosphere keeps much of the Sun’s energy from escaping into space. This process, called the greenhouse effect, keeps the planet warm enough for life to exist. The atmosphere allows about half of the Sun’s heat energy (50%) to reach Earth’s surface.

Who keeps the Earth warm?
-------------------------

greenhouse gases  
Earth’s surface warms up in the sunlight. At night, Earth’s surface cools, releasing heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That’s what keeps our Earth a warm and cozy 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 degrees Celsius), on average.

Where are the oceans warmer on Earth?
-------------------------------------

Indian Ocean  
The Indian Ocean has the warmest temperatures of the world’s oceans. Ocean water temperature is important to understand, as it affects global climate and marine ecosystems. The Indian Ocean is the warmest in the world. Ocean surface temperatures have risen by about 1.6°F over the past 100 years, due to global warming.

How much of Earth’s heat is now stored in the ocean?
----------------------------------------------------

90 percent  
In fact, more than 90 percent of it gets stored in the ocean.

What is the nickname of Earth during the ice age?
-------------------------------------------------

In 1840, Louis Agassiz, a Swiss natural scientist, was among the first to acknowledge and provide evidence that Earth had gone through ice ages, according to the University of California Museum of Paleontology. Joseph Kirschvink, an American geologist, later coined the term “snowball Earth,” in a 1992 textbook.

What are 3 reasons that the Earth was really hot?
-------------------------------------------------

There are three main sources of heat in the deep earth: (1) heat from when the planet formed and accreted, which has not yet been lost; (2) frictional heating, caused by denser core material sinking to the center of the planet; and (3) heat from the decay of radioactive elements.

How does the ocean affect the Earth’s climate?
----------------------------------------------

Thus, heat energy in the ocean can warm the planet for decades after it was absorbed. If the ocean absorbs more heat than it releases, its heat content increases. Knowing how much heat energy the ocean absorbs and releases is essential for understanding and modeling global climate.

How much heat is stored in the ocean?
-------------------------------------

Averaged over Earth’s surface, the 1993–2017 heat-gain rates are 0.36–0.40 watts per square meter for 0–700 meters, and 0.19–0.35 for depths of 700–2,000 meters. Heat already stored in the ocean will eventually be released, committing Earth to additional warming in the future.

How does the earth keep us so warm?
-----------------------------------

We have plenty of air to breathe, plenty of food to eat, and plenty of sunshine to keep us warm.

What is the warmest ocean?
--------------------------

Indian Ocean. The waters of the Indian Ocean have temperatures ranging between 72 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit on the upper layer of the ocean. The ocean also has no Arctic contact which ensures the ocean remains relatively warm all year round. The warm waters provide optimal conditions for phytoplankton growth which helps foster…
