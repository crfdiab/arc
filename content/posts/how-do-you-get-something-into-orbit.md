How do you get something into orbit?
------------------------------------

All satellites today get into orbit by riding on a rocket. Many used to hitch a ride in the cargo bay of the space shuttle. Several countries and businesses have rocket launch capabilities, and satellites as large as several tons make it into orbit regularly and safely.

How long does it take a spaceship to get into orbit?
----------------------------------------------------

Space is at the end of Earth’s atmosphere, about 62 miles upwards. This is called the Karman Line and means you’ve gone past the Thermosphere and are now into the Exosphere. NASA launch director Mike Leinbach said: “It takes the shuttle approximately 8-1/2 minutes to get to orbit.

What keeps a spacecraft in orbit?
---------------------------------

Gravity is the main force to be dealt with in space, and thrust is the force that allows a spacecraft to get into space and maneuver. A spacecraft in orbit is not beyond the reach of Earth’s gravity. In fact, gravity is what holds it in orbit—without gravity, the spacecraft would fly off in a straight path.

Is it illegal to launch your own satellite?
-------------------------------------------

It doesn’t matter how large or small the satellite is, you need to obtain a license from the Federal Communications Agency. Why? Because your could end up interfering with other satellites by either communication frequencies or orbital path.

Can a spaceship fall out of orbit?
----------------------------------

For instance, NASA scientists estimate that the space shuttle, about the size of a passenger plane, can stay in orbit for about a month before this force causes it to slow enough that it falls out of its orbit.

How is the Space Shuttle lifted into orbit?
-------------------------------------------

In that case, the space shuttle itself is lifted by rockets into orbit. The spacecraft to be deployed is riding snugly in the cargo bay. At a certain height, the spacecraft is ejected and small rockets on it move it to the proper orbit altitude.

How are satellites and spacecraft launched into space?
------------------------------------------------------

We launch satellites and spacecraft into space by putting them on rockets carrying tons of propellants. The propellants give the rocket enough energy to boost away from Earth’s surface. Because of the pull of Earth’s gravity, largest, heaviest spacecraft need the biggest rockets and the most propellent.

How does the International Space Station stay in orbit?
-------------------------------------------------------

Satellites that orbit close to Earth feel a stronger tug of Earth’s gravity. To stay in orbit, they must travel faster than a satellite orbiting farther away. The International Space Station orbits about 250 miles above the Earth and travels at a speed of about 17,150 miles per hour.

How does the space station Skylab orbit the Earth?
--------------------------------------------------

The space station Skylab orbiting the Earth. An object in motion will stay in motion unless something pushes or pulls on it. This is Isaac Newton’s First Law of Motion. Without gravity, an Earth-orbiting satellite would go off into space along a straight line. With gravity, it is pulled back toward the Earth.
