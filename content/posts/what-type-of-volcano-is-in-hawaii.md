What type of volcano is in Hawaii?
----------------------------------

shield  
Hawaii’s main volcanoes are “shield” volcanoes, which produce lava flows that form gently sloping, shield-like mountains. A good example is Maunaloa, the most massive mountain on earth, deceptively covering half of Hawaii Island.

Is Mount Kilauea active or dormant?
-----------------------------------

The Big Island’s Kilauea volcano, the most active volcano in the world, became dormant in September of 2018 after 35 years of continous activity. Since the volcano has now officially been classified as dormant, many wonder what they will see at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park during this respite of activity.

What kind of lava is erupting from Kilauea Volcano?
---------------------------------------------------

What is the general compositional category of the eruptive materials at Kilauea? Kilauea is a basaltic shield volcano, erupting a type of basalt known as tholeiite. This type of lava is the dominant extrusive during the shield building (the main stage) of hawaiian volcanism and is the dominant basalt type erupted on Earth.

Which island is Kilauea on?
---------------------------

Kilauea is the youngest and most active Hawaiian shield volcano, located on the southern part of the Island of Hawai’i, known as Big Island. Hawai’i is the southernmost and largest of the island chain, which owes its existence to the very active Hawaiian hot spot.

How did Kilauea in Hawaii get its name?
---------------------------------------

In other words, Kīlauea is to Mauna Kea as Lō‘ihi is to Mauna Loa. Hawaiians used the word Kīlauea only for the summit caldera, but earth scientists and, over time, popular usage have extended the name to include the entire volcano. Kīlauea is the home of Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess.

What are the names of the volcanoes in Hawaii?
----------------------------------------------

It is a magical experience and it’s no wonder native Hawaiians consider it sacred! Iao Valley (pronounced ee-ow) is located just above the town of Wailuku and is the erosional remnants of a large shield volcano that formed the West Maui Mountains over 1 million years ago. Iao Needle is actually a basaltic core remnant of the volcano.
