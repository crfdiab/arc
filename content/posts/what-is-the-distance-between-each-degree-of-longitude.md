What is the distance between each degree of longitude?
------------------------------------------------------

Degrees of latitude are parallel so the distance between each degree remains almost constant but since degrees of longitude are farthest apart at the equator and converge at the poles, their distance varies greatly. Each degree of latitude is approximately 69 miles (111 kilometers) apart.

How are longitude lines different from latitude lines?
------------------------------------------------------

Unlike latitude lines, longitude lines are not parallel. Meridians meet at the poles and are widest apart at the equator. Zero degrees longitude (0Â°) is called the prime meridian.

How does the distance between two consecutive longitudes change?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The distance between two consecutive longitudes vary as we move from poles ( 90 degree latitude ) to the equator ( 0 degree latitude ) . BUT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO CONSECUTIVE LONGITUDES REMAIN THE SAME OVER A PARTICULAR LATITUDE.

Which is the correct way to calculate latitude and longitude?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Latitudes and longitudes may be entered in any of three different formats, decimal degrees (DD.DD), degrees and decimal minutes (DD:MM.MM) or degrees, minutes, and decimal seconds (DD:MM:SS.SS). Important Note: The distance calculator on this page is provided for informational purposes only.

A degree of longitude is widest at the equator with a distance of 69.172 miles (111.321 kilometers). The distance gradually shrinks to zero as they meet at the poles. At 40 degrees north or south, the distance between a degree of longitude is 53 miles (85 kilometers).

How to calculate the length of a degree?
----------------------------------------

This calculator requires the use of Javascript enabled and capable browsers. This script will calculate the length of one degree of both latitude and longitude, for a specific latitude. Lengths for both are calculated in nautical miles, statute miles, feet, and meters. Enter the specific latitude.

What is the distance between 40 degrees north and South?
--------------------------------------------------------

At 40 degrees north or south, the distance between a degree of longitude is 53 miles (85 kilometers). The line at 40 degrees north runs through the middle of the United States and China, as well as Turkey and Spain.

How many miles is one degree north or South?
--------------------------------------------

A degree of latitude, one degree north or south, is about the same distance anywhere, about 69 miles (111 kilometers). But a degree of longitude, one degree east or west, is a different distance at different points on the globe.
