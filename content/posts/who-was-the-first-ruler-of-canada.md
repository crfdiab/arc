Who was the first ruler of Canada?
----------------------------------

Canada’s monarchical status began with the establishment of the French colony of New France in the name of King Francis I in 1534; although a previous claim was made by England in the name of King Henry VII in 1497 when John Cabot made landfall in what is thought to be modern day Newfoundland or Nova Scotia.

The Queen (then Princess Elizabeth) and The Duke of Edinburgh first toured Canada in the fall of 1951.

The Queen’s 2010 tour marked her 22nd official tour of Canada as our Queen.

Why does the queen still rule Canada?

Does The Queen still control Canada?
------------------------------------

Who was the first British Queen to be Queen of Canada?

Following her father’s death, Elizabeth (b. 1926) became the first British monarch to be specifically proclaimed “Queen of Canada.” Her reign saw the final dissolution of the British Empire into the Commonwealth, which she has worked hard to keep relevant.

Who is the longest reigning queen of Canada?
--------------------------------------------

Queen Elizabeth II is Canada’s longest reigning post-Conquest monarch. She surpassed Queen Victoria’s tenure on September 9, 2015. Owing to their longevity, a woman has been sovereign of Canada for the majority of its post-Confederation history.

Why is Canada still under the British monarchy?
-----------------------------------------------

This arrangement allows Canada to still be “under” the British royals, while simultaneously allowing Canada to argue it has its “own” independent monarchy. In other words, Elizabeth is supposed to consider her role as Canada’s queen distinct from her role as Britain’s queen, and so are the rest of us.

Why is there a queen of Canada now?
-----------------------------------

The statute expresses Canada’s support of alterations to the British law of royal succession, notably the ending of male primogeniture. In principle, this should mean that there is a greater likelihood that Canada will again have a queen in the future.
