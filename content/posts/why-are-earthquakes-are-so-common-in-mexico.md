Why are earthquakes are so common in Mexico?
--------------------------------------------

Mexico’s location makes the country prone to strong earthquakes because it is in a so-called subduction zone. In Mexico’s case, an oceanic plate — the Cocos — is gradually sinking beneath a continental plate — the North American.

When was the last time Mexico had a earthquake?
-----------------------------------------------

19 September 2017  
The earthquake caused damage in the Mexican states of Puebla and Morelos and in the Greater Mexico City area, including the collapse of more than 40 buildings…

Why are there so many earthquakes in Mexico?
--------------------------------------------

Southern Mexico also contains numerous faults, which causes that section of the country to have high tectonic activity. Northeastern Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula are not as seismically active as the area close to the boundary between the North American and Cocos plates, but destructive earthquakes can still occur in those areas.

Where are the earthquake fault lines in Mexico?
-----------------------------------------------

Geology. Mexico lies within two seismically active earthquake zones. The Baja California peninsula lies near the boundary of the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, while southern Mexico lies just north of the boundary between the North American Plate and the Cocos and Rivera tectonic plates.

Are there any earthquakes in the Yucatan Peninsula?
---------------------------------------------------

Northeastern Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula are not as seismically active as the area close to the boundary between the North American and Cocos plates, but destructive earthquakes can still occur in those areas. VII? Stover &amp; Coffman 1993 uses various seismic scales.

Are there any earthquakes going on in New Mexico?
-------------------------------------------------

This is the latest shaking going on in New Mexico. So although New Mexico isn’t a hotbed for earthquake activity, it isn’t immune from a seismic dance or two. As befits the low key nature of the state, its earthquakes are small and unobtrusive, rather befitting of a state known for its earthy adobe walls and elegant mesas. Was this page helpful?
