Why does hot dry and sunny weather cause a problem for photosynthesis?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On a hot, dry, sunny day with a warm breeze, plants with large leaves lose a tremendous amount of water. On a cool, cloudy, humid day, plants transpire far less.

Why can photosynthesis not occur at very high temperatures?
-----------------------------------------------------------

As with any other enzyme-controlled reaction, the rate of photosynthesis is affected by temperature. At low temperatures, the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the number of molecular collisions between enzymes and substrates. At high temperatures, enzymes are denatured .

How does temperature affect photosynthesis in plants?
-----------------------------------------------------

Temperature. As with any other enzyme-controlled reaction, the rate of photosynthesis is affected by temperature. At low temperatures, the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the number of molecular collisions between enzymes and substrates. At high temperatures, enzymes are denatured .

How do light water and heat affect photosynthesis?
--------------------------------------------------

Light is an extremely important factor for the process. If there is enough water, carbon dioxide, and the temperature is right, light becomes the factor which will affect photosynthesis. Most of the time, when the intensity of light is high, you will get a a greater rate of photosynthesis.

How do plants survive in hot conditions?
----------------------------------------

The following adaptations allow plants to survive in the hot desert environment: Small leaves – these ensure that less water is lost from the plant by transpiration because the leaf has a smaller surface area. Waxy skin – some leaves have a thick, waxy skin on their surface. This reduces water loss by transpiration.

What are the three main functions of leaves?
--------------------------------------------

The leaves perform three main functions such as manufacture of food, interchange of gases between the atmosphere and the plant body and evaporation of water.

Does photosynthesis continues to increase with temperature?
-----------------------------------------------------------

In Photosynthesis, the temperature continues to increase but with limits. In this process, plants and other organisms convert the light energy from the sun into a chemical energy then released to fuel the organisms’ activities. The rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature increases.

Does photosynthesis increase with temperature?
----------------------------------------------

The higher the temperature then typically the greater the rate of photosynthesis, photosynthesis is a chemical reaction and the rate of most chemical reactions increases with temperature. However, for photosynthesis at temperatures above 40°C the rate slows down. Enzymes are affected a great deal by temperature.

Which of the following will not affect photosynthesis?
------------------------------------------------------

It is one of the major factors affecting photosynthesis. Photosynthesis cannot occur in the dark and the source of light for the plants is sunlight. However, the light becomes a limiting factor in low intensity because no matter how much water or CO2 is present, without light photosynthesis cannot occur.

Can plants recover from heat stress?
------------------------------------

In new results reported in The Plant Cell, molecular biologist Elizabeth Vierling at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and colleagues in India and China report finding a crucial mechanism that plants need to recover from heat stress.

How do you help plants in extreme heat?
---------------------------------------

Here are 5 of the most important summer plant care tips to get you started.

1. Promote high humidity.
2. Water well, and water deeply.
3. Shade sensitive plants from too much sun.
4. Keep it cool.
5. Don’t fertilize during a heat wave.
6. Don’t re-pot during a heat wave.
7. Wait to prune.
8. Learn to recognize stress.

Why are most plants unable to carry out photosynthesis?
-------------------------------------------------------

Why is it difficult for most plants to carry out photosynthesis in very hot, dry environments such as deserts? The closing of stomata keeps CO2 from entering and O2 from leaving the plant. (To conserve water the plant will often close its stomata, preventing CO2 and O2 from moving.)

What happens to plants when the temperature gets hot?
-----------------------------------------------------

The hotter that the temperature gets, the more the processes of a plant, like photosynthesis and water usage and storage, will speed up. They will work faster and faster up to around 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

Why does a plant close its stomata during photosynthesis?
---------------------------------------------------------

The closing of stomata keeps CO2 from entering and O2 from leaving the plant. (To conserve water the plant will often close its stomata, preventing CO2 and O2 from moving.) While on a field trip to a tropical rain forest, you discover a plant with orange leaves.

How does the amount of sunlight affect a plant?
-----------------------------------------------

Light quantity refers to the intensity, or concentration, of sunlight. It varies with the seasons. The maximum amount of light is present in summer, and the minimum in winter. Up to a point, the more sunlight a plant receives, the greater its capacity for producing food via photosynthesis.
