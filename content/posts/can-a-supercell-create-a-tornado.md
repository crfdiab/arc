Can a supercell create a tornado?
---------------------------------

Supercell Tornadoes Tornadoes that come from a supercell thunderstorm are the most common, and often the most dangerous. A rotating updraft is a key to the development of a supercell, and eventually a tornado. Once the updraft is rotating and being fed by warm, moist air flowing in at ground level, a tornado can form.

Can a tornado form without a supercell?
---------------------------------------

Non-supercell tornadoes are circulations that do not form from organized storm-scale rotation. These tornadoes form from a vertically spinning parcel of air already occurring near the ground caused by wind shear from a warm, cold, or sea breeze front, or a dryline. Another non-supercell tornado is a landspout.

How long does a supercell tornado last?
---------------------------------------

two to six hours  
Updraft speeds in supercell storms can exceed 40 metres (130 feet) per second and are capable of suspending hailstones as large as grapefruit. Supercells can last two to six hours. They are the most likely storm to produce spectacular wind and hail damage as well as powerful tornadoes.

Are supercell storms dangerous?
-------------------------------

As we shall see, circumstances keep some supercells from producing tornadoes, even with the presence of a mesocyclone. Even though it is the rarest of storm types, the supercell is the most dangerous because of the extreme weather generated.

How often does a tornado form in a supercell?
---------------------------------------------

When tornadoes are spawned by supercells, they are near the hook echo on radar. (INTERACTIVE: Experience the Formation of a Tornado) The National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) says fewer than 20 percent of all supercell thunderstorms produce tornadoes.

Which is an example of a supercell thunderstorm?
------------------------------------------------

A recent example is a supercell in southwest Georgia on Jan. 22, which spawned a tornado in progress for 72 minutes along a 70-mile-long path. Low-pressure systems in various regions of the world can spawn supercell thunderstorms when atmospheric conditions are ripe.

When do Supercells occur in the United States?
----------------------------------------------

A somewhat recent example is a supercell in southwestern Georgia on Jan. 22, 2017, which spawned a tornado in progress for 72 minutes along a 70-mile-long path. Low-pressure systems in various regions of the world can spawn supercell thunderstorms when atmospheric conditions are ripe.

Where does a supercell appear on Doppler radar?
-----------------------------------------------

Supercells have a distinct appearance on Doppler radar, which often features a so-called hook echo on the lower-left portion of the storm. That hook echo appendage extends southward from the thunderstormâ€™s main core, where large hail and heavy rain are typically located.
