Can you get money from soda tabs?
---------------------------------

Who knew you could make money by selling pop can tabs? Although you won’t get rich doing so, you can definitely pull in some extra cash – likely more than you’d make by keeping them on the cans and turning them in to the aluminum recycling center.

How much can you get for can tabs?
----------------------------------

Now the big question, just how much money can you expect to make selling all the soda pop can tabs you collect? If you decide to recycle them, the current rate for aluminum is around $0.40 per pound.

Do Shriners pop tabs?
---------------------

Pull-tabs or “pop-tops”, from beverage cans can be saved and donated to the Bektash Shriners. The tabs are sold to a recycling company and the money collected is used to fund transportation for needy children to and from our Shriners Hospitals.

How much does a pound of pop tabs cost?
---------------------------------------

It takes approximately 1,128 pop tabs to equal one pound. We typically receive between $0.40 to $0.50 per pound of pop tabs. This program brings in an average of $6,000 each year. Last year you donated over 13 million pop tabs! We accept more than just soda pop tabs. The tabs can come from energy drinks, soup cans, or anything with a metallic tab.

How much money can you make by recycling soda cans?
---------------------------------------------------

One charity told us that a truckload of cans yields about $10 at the recycler while a truckload of tabs yields about $1,000. It seems to depend, however, on which recycling company you’re dealing with. Some of them don’t accept tabs for recycling.

How much is 1 gallon of tabs worth?
-----------------------------------

A 1-gallon milk jug can hold approximately 4,000 aluminum tabs pulled from soda cans, and 1 million tabs is worth about $360, as of October 2014. Thus, a jug of 4,000 tabs is worth about $1.44. There have been many circulating rumors about the value of pull tabs from soda cans, but most are false.

How much does a pound of aluminum tabs cost?
--------------------------------------------

In our area the best price is around $0.60 per pound, but that is if it is pure aluminum. If the rivet is steel, the price goes down drastically. I expect it would take a lot of pull tabs to equal a pound.
