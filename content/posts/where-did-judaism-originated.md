Where did Judaism originated?
-----------------------------

Israel  
The origins of Judaism date back more than 3500 years. This religion is rooted in the ancient near eastern region of Canaan (which today constitutes Israel and the Palestinian territories). Judaism emerged from the beliefs and practices of the people known as “Israel”.

Why was Judaism founded?
------------------------

Judaism is one of the oldest monotheistic religions and was founded over 3500 years ago in the Middle East. Jews believe that God appointed the Jews to be his chosen people in order to set an example of holiness and ethical behaviour to the world.

Where did the origin of Judaism take place?
-------------------------------------------

Judaism began in a region known as Canaan, which is located in territories belonging to Palestine and Israel. The location of Canaan is unknown as the name of the territory tended to move with the Jewish people, yet it is generally the region between the Jordan and the Mediterranean. The name refers to the area where the Hebrew people lived.

How did the Jewish people get the Land of Israel?
-------------------------------------------------

The Jewish people base their claim to the land of Israel on at least four premises: 1) God promised the land to the patriarch Abraham; 2) the Jewish people settled and developed the land; 3) the international community granted political sovereignty in Palestine to the Jewish people and 4) the territory was captured in defensive wars.

What did the people of ancient Israel believe in?
-------------------------------------------------

The people of ancient Israel and Judah, however, were not followers of Judaism: they were practitioners of a polytheistic culture worshiping multiple gods, concerned with fertility and local shrines and legends, and not with a written Torah, elaborate laws governing ritual purity, or an exclusive covenant and national god.

How long has the Jewish people been in Israel?
----------------------------------------------

In reality, the Jewish people have maintained ties to their historic homeland for more than 3,700 years. A national language and a distinct civilization have been maintained.
