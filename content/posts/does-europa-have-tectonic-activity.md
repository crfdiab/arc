Does Europa have tectonic activity?
-----------------------------------

A Brown University study provides new evidence that the icy shell of Jupiter’s moon Europa may have plate tectonics similar to those on Earth. The presence of plate tectonic activity could have important implications for the possibility of life in the ocean thought to exist beneath the moon’s surface.

Does Europa have active volcanoes?
----------------------------------

Europa is one of the rare planetary bodies that might have maintained volcanic activity over billions of years, and possibly the only one beyond Earth that has large water reservoirs and a long-lived source of energy.

Why doesn’t Europe have earthquakes?
------------------------------------

Earthquakes in Europe are essentially a result of stress in the earth’s crust. For naturally occurring earthquakes, the source of this stress is plate tectonics. Because of the microplates, earthquakes in Europe occur across a large area, not only along a well-defined zone. …

Is Europa the most volcanically active?
---------------------------------------

According to the team’s calculations, Europa’s hydrogen is generated as seawater reacts with rock in the moon’s crust. After all, the neighboring moon Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system; Jupiter’s gravity and tidal forces deform Io’s crust and mantle, generating huge amounts of heat.

Is Earth the only planet with tectonic plates?
----------------------------------------------

Like Earth, Venus and Mars are believed to have hot interiors. This means that they are continuing to lose heat. While their surfaces show evidence of recent deformation — tectonism — neither planet has plate tectonic activity because neither planet has a surface divided into plates.

Do any moons have tectonic plates?
----------------------------------

The Moon certainly has never experienced plate tectonics. Mars is small, very cold and comparatively dry, and what water was there was almost certainly driven underground: I do not believe in the idea of big surface oceans on Mars, though some do!

How many earthquakes have there been in Europe?
-----------------------------------------------

Europe has had: (M1.5 or greater) 1 earthquake in the past 24 hours. 3 earthquakes in the past 7 days. 15 earthquakes in the past 30 days. 361 earthquakes in the past 365 days.

How many earthquakes have there been in the past 24 hours?
----------------------------------------------------------

Report it! During the past 24 hours, there were 1 quake of magnitude 6.1, 2 quakes between 5.0 and 6.0, 48 quakes between 4.0 and 5.0, 121 quakes between 3.0 and 4.0, and 239 quakes between 2.0 and 3.0. There were also 420 quakes below magnitude 2.0 which people don’t normally feel.

Where do most earthquakes and tsunamis occur in Europe?
-------------------------------------------------------

Most of the earthquakes occur on the Eurasian Plate but earthquakes and submarine landslide also occur in western Europe like France, Norway and the United Kingdom which have been struck by tsunamis.

Where can I find list of earthquakes in the world?
--------------------------------------------------

If you are looking for smaller and/or earthquakes in a specific region, you can look them up on the pages of specific countries or regions. Otherwise, there would be hundreds or thousands of earthquakes shown here. Felt a quake?
