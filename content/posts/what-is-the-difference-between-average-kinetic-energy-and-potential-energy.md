What is the difference between average kinetic energy and potential energy?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The average kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules is measured by the temperature of the body. As the suspended body moves upward in its swing, its kinetic energy is continuously being changed into potential energy; the higher it goes the greater becomes the energy that it owes to its position.

Is kinetic energy equal to elastic potential energy?
----------------------------------------------------

As the object starts to move, the elastic potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, becoming entirely kinetic energy at the equilibrium position. The energy is then converted back into elastic potential energy by the spring as it is stretched or compressed.

What’s the percent difference between 2 numbers?
------------------------------------------------

First: work out the difference (increase) between the two numbers you are comparing. Then: divide the increase by the original number and multiply the answer by 100. % increase = Increase ÷ Original Number × 100.

What are the similarities and differences of potential energy and kinetic energy?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kinetic energy is energy possessed by a body by virtue of its movement. Potential energy is the energy possessed by a body by virtue of its position or state. While kinetic energy of an object is relative to the state of other objects in its environment, potential energy is completely independent of its environment.

What are the similarities of kinetic energy and potential energy?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most important similarities between potential energy and kinetic energy is that they can both be converted into each other’s form of energy. When a force is applied to potential energy it converts to kinetic energy. This means that when an object such as a ball is still it has the potential to move.

Does a compressed spring have kinetic energy?
---------------------------------------------

A compressed spring stores potential energy, released as kinetic energy when it expands.

What is the relationship between potential and kinetic energy?
--------------------------------------------------------------

In theory, the amount of energy transferred remains constant in a closed system with energy either being stored or in motion. Energy that is stored is known as potential energy, and energy in motion is known as kinetic energy. The amount of kinetic energy an object has is related to the object’s speed and mass.

What do potential and kinetic energy have in common Brainpop?
-------------------------------------------------------------

What does potential and kinetic energy have in common? They´re both related to motion.

How is potential energy different from kinetic energy?
------------------------------------------------------

Kinetic energy is energy possessed by a body by virtue of its movement.Potential energy is the energy possessed by a body by virtue of its position or state.While kinetic energy of an object is relative to the state of other objects in its environment, potential energy is completely independent of its environment.

Which is greater kinetic energy 1 or 10?
----------------------------------------

In fact, the kinetic energy of the 0.1 kg object will be 100 times greater than the kinetic energy of the 10 kg object. The kinetic energy of an object is directly proportional to how much damage it will inflict when it strikes something.

How to find the formula for kinetic energy?
-------------------------------------------

Kinetic Energy Formula. Kinetic energy is directly proportional to the object’s mass and its velocity square, which is. K.E. = 12\*m\*v2. Where m is the mass in kilograms, v is the velocity in m/s. The SI unit of measurement of Kinetic energy is the same as Potential energy which is kg. m2/s2 or Joule (J).

Which is larger the kinetic energy or the momentum?
---------------------------------------------------

Since m is in the denominator, the kinetic energy is larger for a smaller m, with P held constant. Therefore, the object weighing 0.1 kg will have a lot more kinetic energy than the object weighing 10 kg, for a given momentum P. In fact, the kinetic energy of the 0.1 kg object will be 100 times greater than the kinetic energy of the 10 kg object.
