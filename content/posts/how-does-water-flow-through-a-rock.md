How does water flow through a rock?
-----------------------------------

Gravity generates the flow of springs, rivers, and wells. If the pores in rocks and sediments are connected, gravity allows the water to move slowly through them. However, the smaller the opening, the harder it is for gravity to cause water movement.

How does underground water flow?
--------------------------------

Groundwater flows faster where the hydraulic gradient and/or hydraulic conductivity are larger. Groundwater flow velocities are much slower than surface water flow velocities, except in limestone karst formations, where groundwater flows through caves and large solution channels.

Do rocks contain water?
-----------------------

All Rocks Contain Water Both at and below Earth’s surface, water in rocks drives geological processes. Within Earth, water plays a critical role in transforming and melting rocks. At shallow depths, much of the water is stored in tiny pores between mineral grains.

Can rocks hold water?
---------------------

rock solid. Rocks that make up good aquifers not only have pores, but pores that are interconnected. Sandstone: Fine-grained rocks such as sandstone make good aquifers. They can hold water like a sponge, and with their tiny pores, they are good at filtering surface pollutants.

How fast does water flow underground?
-------------------------------------

A velocity of 1 foot per day or greater is a high rate of movement for ground water, and ground-water velocities can be as low as 1 foot per year or 1 foot per decade.

How can you tell underground water flow?
----------------------------------------

The ground penetrating radar (GPR) system is used for underground water detection. GPR is a promising technology to detect and identify aquifer water or nonmetallic mines. One of the most serious components for the performance of GPR is the antenna system.

Can you squeeze water from a rock?
----------------------------------

It goes along the lines of “it’s like squeezing water from a stone”. In most cases, this is true. Unless we mimic pressure and temperature conditions that exist deep in the Earth, here on the surface, squeezing a rock and having water come out is a bit laughable.

Does water stay trapped inside rock?
------------------------------------

Scientists have found evidence that water was trapped for up to billions of years inside rocks deep in an African gold mine.

What rocks dont absorb water?
-----------------------------

Fine-grained sedimentary rocks, like clay, although having gaps between the grains (and so being porous), like sandstone, have gaps that are so small that water can’t flow through, so they are impermeable. Permeable sandstone underground can store water (or oil and gas).

What rocks can go in water?
---------------------------

An aquifer is a body of saturated rock through which water can easily move. Aquifers must be both permeable and porous and include such rock types as sandstone, conglomerate, fractured limestone and unconsolidated sand and gravel. Fractured volcanic rocks such as columnar basalts also make good aquifers.

How is water able to travel through the ground?
-----------------------------------------------

Understanding how water travels underground is an important aspect of hydrogeology. Surface water that infiltrates into the ground is called recharge. Water is able to pass through soil pores and pores in rocks – and some of them with great ease – due to the permeability of the material.

Where does the water from the rock come from?
---------------------------------------------

An alternative account of the water from the rock comes from Psalm 78:20 where it is God who performs the miracle, “Behold, (He) struck (the) rock.”

How is surface water able to pass through soil?
-----------------------------------------------

Surface water that infiltrates into the ground is called recharge. Water is able to pass through soil pores and pores in rocks – and some of them with great ease – due to the permeability of the material. This section will explore what permeability is, and the impact different rock and soil properties, such as porosity, have on permeability.

How does water move through the Earth’s crust?
----------------------------------------------

Water flows quickly through material with high permeability and flows very slowly through material with low permeability. If you imagine pouring water into a bucket of gravel, the water will flow around the stones rather quickly. If you pour water over a bucket of sand however, the water will move more slowly as it works its way through …
