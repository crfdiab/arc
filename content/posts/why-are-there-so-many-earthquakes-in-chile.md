Why are there so many earthquakes in Chile?
-------------------------------------------

The subduction of the fast-moving Nazca Plate has a history of producing massive quakes. This list of earthquakes in Chile includes every known major earthquake that was felt or with its epicenter within Chile’s current boundaries.

Where was the epicenter of the Chilean earthquake in 2010?
----------------------------------------------------------

On 26 March, at 10:52:06 local time, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake hit the Atacama region, in Northern Chile. The Biobio Region of Chile has had strong aftershocks of this earthquake. The first one was a magnitude 6.7 M W earthquake that struck off the coast of Biobío, Chile, at 23:21 on 15 March 2010 at the epicenter\]

How big was the earthquake in Chile in 1960?
--------------------------------------------

Regional and ocean-wide tsunami warnings are crucial for saving lives in areas at some distance from the earthquake that caused them. International cooperation in this area began following the 1960 Chile earthquake which, at magnitude 9.5, is the largest ever recorded.

How many people died in Coquimbo Chile earthquake?
--------------------------------------------------

A river of water pushed debris and sand throughout a bustling section of the town’s waterfront just as darkness was settling on the 150,000-person city. Nine people were killed in the Coquimbo region, and a further four elsewhere in Chile.

What caused the Chile earthquake of 1960? The Nazca plate is a large tectonic plate that underlies the Pacific Ocean near the western coast of South America. It is subducting under (that is, being forced under) the South American plate.

How many times has Chile had earthquakes?
-----------------------------------------

Of the world’s 36 known earthquakes with M ≥ 8.5 since the year 1500, one-third occurred in Chile and are shown in the map to the side. Some virtually have the same epicenters like the 1604 and 1868 (in Arica), the 1730 and 1822 (in Valparaíso), the 1751 and 1835 (in Concepción), and the 1575 and 1837 (in Valdivia).

Is Chile prone to natural disasters?
------------------------------------

Chile, a land of great contrasts and arresting beauty, has many active volcanoes. The most important natural hazards threatening the entire country are volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis (due to its extensive coastline), floods, avalanches, and forest and urban fires.

Why do so many powerful earthquakes happen in Chile?
----------------------------------------------------

Most earthquakes happen at plate boundaries. The earth’s crust stores stresses caused by plate tectonics movement. When the fault plane slides, the land breaks and produces earthquake waves. Chile is among one of countries facing dangerous earthquakes because it is located on active seismic zones namely Ring of Fire.

What happens when the Nazca Plate slips under the South American Plate?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Nazca plate slips under the South American plate, grinding rocks on its way just like a wiper blade over a dirty windshield. Chile would be the “blade”: the surface bends for a few years, building up energy , then dissipate it as seismic/volcanic activity. That’s why people here prefer a few tremors per year than a big one every 10 years.

Which is the most likely cause of an earthquake?
------------------------------------------------

Earthquakes are caused mostly by natural activity, which cannot be prevented. We can however prevent earthquakes caused by human activities. Induced seismicity is however typically minor and not usually a very big cause for concern.
