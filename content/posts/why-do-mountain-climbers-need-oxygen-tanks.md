Why do mountain climbers need oxygen tanks?
-------------------------------------------

Mountaineers carry oxygen cylinders while going to high mountain peaks because altitude increases as they climb the mountain. The amount of oxygen decreases as the altitude increases. Oxygen cylinders can also be used for scuba diving or breathing gas. Oxygen cylinders can also be used during surgery.

Why do climbers bring oxygen tanks to the top of Mount Everest?
---------------------------------------------------------------

At extreme altitude supplementary oxygen can be used to prevent or reduce the effects of severe hypoxia. Having said that, it needs to be used in conjunction with a sensible acclimatisation schedule. Everest has rarely been climbed without oxygen and most climbers use bottled oxygen above 7,000m on an 8,000m peak.

Do you need an air tank to climb Mount Everest?
-----------------------------------------------

High-altitude climbing (mountaineering) usually requires the use of portable oxygen apparatus when climbing Mount Everest or the other eight-thousanders, though some mountaineers have ascended Everest without oxygen.

Can Mt Everest be climbed without oxygen?
-----------------------------------------

While it is just possible for man to reach the summit of Everest without supplementary oxygen, this can only be done at the expense of extreme hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis, and even then the arterial PO2 is less than 30 Torr.

Can I buy a tank of oxygen?
---------------------------

Sure, you can purchase an oxygen tank for a couple of hundred bucks or even rent one, but the cost to maintain and refill them is vastly more than what portable oxygen concentrators cost. If you want to refill your oxygen tanks at home, you’re going to need to own a home fill oxygen station.

What is oxygen level on Everest?
--------------------------------

60 percent  
If the body is deprived of oxygen for too long, organs begin to shut down. However, on top of Mount Everest— the tallest mountain in the world at 29,029 feet—many people reach oxygen levels of 60 percent and yet manage to function reasonably well.

How much does it cost for a tank of oxygen?
-------------------------------------------

A compressed oxygen tank costs about $5.69 per day, while the option with the lowest daily cost is the Inogen One G4 at just $1.92 per day.

How many oxygen tanks do you need to climb Everest?
---------------------------------------------------

Climbers who use supplementary oxygen on Everest typically use 4 or 5 tanks, although they may not empty all of them. Most switch on oxygen as they set out from Camp 3 at 7,100m. Climbing out of Camp 4 on summit night, they’ll switch on a fresh tank in their backpack.

When was the last time someone climbed Mount Everest without oxygen?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A Mexican climber reached the top of Everest without oxygen on May 12. Before that, the most recent summit without oxygen and the most recent death without it occurred four days apart in May 2013.

Why does oxygen leak out of an Everest mask?
--------------------------------------------

The valve in the original mask design often allowed a climber’s exhale to enter the rubber reservoir preventing new oxygen from refilling the reservoir thus sending oxygen directly to the mask where it leaked out or was unused as the climber exhaled. This was often due to the valve freezing from the moisture in a climber’s breath.

How is oxygen delivered to the climber’s mask?
----------------------------------------------

Oxygen is delivered to the mask at a constant flow adjusted by a regulator. While the climber breathes out the constant flow oxygen is diverted to an accumulator. When an inhalation is made the accumulated oxygen is delivered as the first part of the breath, deep into the lungs.
