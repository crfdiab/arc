Why was building the Panama Canal hard?
---------------------------------------

Why was building the Panama Canal so difficult? Diseases of Malaria and Yellow fever were widespread. Had to get rid of the misquitos that transmitted these diseases. Construction meant cutting through a mountain, daming a river and erecting the canals locks.

What were the engineering challenges in building the canal?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The engineering problems involved digging through the Continental Divide; constructing the largest earth dam ever built up to that time; designing and building the most massive canal locks ever envisioned; constructing the largest gates ever swung; and solving environmental problems of enormous proportions.

What were the difficulties of building the Panama Canal?
--------------------------------------------------------

Diseases of yellow fever and malaria were dangerous obstacles that had already defeated French efforts to construct a panama canal in the 1880s. Many deaths and hospitalized workers had caused the French to give up on their project.

What dangers did workers face when building the Panama Canal?
-------------------------------------------------------------

One of the biggest obstacles for the workforce was sickness. Malaria and yellow fever, spread by mosquito bites, killed more than 22,000 workers before 1889.

Who was the first Chief Engineer of the Panama Canal?
-----------------------------------------------------

The first chief engineer of the Panama Canal project, John Findley Wallace, resigned in frustration after only a year on the isthmus. His replacement, John Stevens, lasted just 20 months, but oversaw the engineering of the canal’s lock system and restructuring of the Panama Railroad — two hurdles critical for the project’s success.

Why did the US build the Panama Canal?
--------------------------------------

After the United States helped Panama gain its independence from Colombia in 1903, the US took on the project. American engineers redesigned the canal to include two sets of three locks, one set on the Pacific entrance to the canal, the other on the Atlantic side. At the time of construction, it was the largest canal lock system ever built.

Is the Panama Canal a modern engineering marvel?
------------------------------------------------

This month I had the opportunity to spend some time at the Panama Canal, a 100-year-old engineering marvel and massive modern construction project. The excursion was part of a joint meeting of Engineers without Borders USA and the American Society of Civil Engineering.

How many locks were there in the Panama Canal?
----------------------------------------------

American engineers redesigned the canal to include two sets of three locks, one set on the Pacific entrance to the canal, the other on the Atlantic side. At the time of construction, it was the largest canal lock system ever built.
