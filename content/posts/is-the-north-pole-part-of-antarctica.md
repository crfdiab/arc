Is the North Pole part of Antarctica?
-------------------------------------

The Antarctic lies south of the Antarctic Circle and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. 2. The geographic North Pole is positioned at the northernmost point in the Arctic; the geographic South Pole is the southernmost point of the Antarctic.

Does the North Pole meet the South Pole?
----------------------------------------

Its latitude is 90 degrees north, and all lines of longitude meet there (as well as at the South Pole, on the opposite end of the Earth).

Is North Pole colder than South Pole?
-------------------------------------

The Short Answer: Both the Arctic (North Pole) and the Antarctic (South Pole) are cold because they don’t get any direct sunlight. However, the South Pole is a lot colder than the North Pole.

Which is colder North or South Pole?
------------------------------------

Is the south pole at the Arctic Ocean?
--------------------------------------

But the South Pole is currently positioned on the continental landmass of Antarctica. Even though Antarctica moves only a few meters a year, we have marked the true South with a permanent marker station. Is the North Pole at the Arctic Ocean? Is the South Pole at the Antarctica continent? Why does ozone depletion occur in the geographic poles?

How is the North Pole different from the South Pole?
----------------------------------------------------

The ice in the north is in the form of a floating polar ice cap, while the ice in the south is mainly in the form of an ice sheet on top of the continent of Antarctica. If the floating ice near the North Pole were to melt, would that make the sea levels rise? What about the ice sheet on top of Antarctica at the South Pole?

Where do the lines of latitude meet at the South Pole?
------------------------------------------------------

It is the precise point of the southern intersection of the Earth’s axis and the Earth’s surface. From the South Pole, all directions are north. Its latitude is 90 degrees south, and all lines of longitude meet there (as well as at the North Pole, on the opposite end of the Earth).

Is the ice at the north or south poles melting?
-----------------------------------------------

(Wikimedia Commons, 2007.) In this ocean science project, you will see if ice melting near the North or South Poles will make sea levels rise. The ice in the north is in the form of a floating polar ice cap, while the ice in the south is mainly in the form of an ice sheet on top of the continent of Antarctica.
