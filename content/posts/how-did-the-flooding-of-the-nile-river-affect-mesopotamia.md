How did the flooding of the Nile River affect Mesopotamia?
----------------------------------------------------------

The floods also brought fish and waterfowl to the Fertile Crescent, which were sources of food for the Mesopotamians. The floods in Mesopotamia improved the soil in the area, allowing for more widespread agriculture. Most of the soil in the region was salty and sandy and not suitable for farming.

What was the difference between the floods in Mesopotamia and the floods in ancient Egypt?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike Mesopotamia, Egypt had a predictable flooding seasons. Farmers, knowing when to expect floods, were able to schedule growing seasons around when crops needed water. Not only did flooding help with good timing with farming, but it also provided rich soil from the flooding.

How did the Nile River help ancient Egyptians develop as a well governed civilization?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How did the Nile River help the ancient Egyptians develop as a well-governed civilization? The Nile helped develop a well-governed civilization by giving the Egyptians a trade route, and having annual that the people took advantage of which helped reduce the destruction of houses.

What were some disadvantages of the Nile river?
-----------------------------------------------

The water from the Nile was used for drinking water, bathing, and watering crops. The only disadvantage of being near the Nile was that it was hard to travel by ship along it, due to cataracts (fast-moving waters).

How did flooding affect the people of Mesopotamia?
--------------------------------------------------

However, Mesopotamia is different because the two rivers kept the land fertile through regular flooding of the area. Like the Nile River in Egypt, the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers allowed the Mesopotamians to grow crops and to settle between these two rivers.

What did the Tigris and Euphrates rivers do for Mesopotamia?
------------------------------------------------------------

Tigris and Euphrates While Mesopotamia’s soil was fertile, the region’s semiarid climate didn’t have much rainfall, with less than ten inches annually. This initially made farming difficult. Irrigation provided Mesopotamian civilization with the ability to stretch the river’s waters into farm lands.

When did the Shuruppak flood occur in Mesopotamia?
--------------------------------------------------

This flood level separated late Protoliterate and Early Dynastic I remains and dates from around 2950 to 2850 BCE. Perhaps, but not certainly, the Shuruppak flood may be equated with the earliest flood at Kish. No other Mesopotamian sites have produced flood remains of significance (Mallowan, 1964).

How did irrigation help the people of Mesopotamia?
--------------------------------------------------

Irrigation allowed the people to draw water from the rivers year-round, enabling them to produce significantly more crops. More crops supported more livestock and people, and the Mesopotamian civilization flourished.
