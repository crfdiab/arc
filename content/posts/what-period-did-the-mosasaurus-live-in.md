What period did the Mosasaurus live in?
---------------------------------------

99.6 million years ago – 66 million years ago (Cretaceous – Paleocene)  
Mosasaurus/Lived

What environment did Mosasaurus live in?
----------------------------------------

the ocean  
Mosasaurs lived in the ocean. It’s likely they preferred shallow waters for the abundant prey which could be found there, but their anatomy suggests that they would also have been excellent open-water swimmers. By the end of the Cretaceous Period, some mosasaurs had even adapted to freshwater environments.

Which was bigger Mosasaurus or megalodon?
-----------------------------------------

So It was around 14.2-15.3 meters long, and possibly weighing 30 tons. Mosasaurus was longer than Megalodon so yeah. But many Megalodon fans say it’s not true, but since this is measured by scientists, this is likely the real size. According to many scientists, it’s the largest fish ever discovered.

When was the time period of the Mosasaurus?
-------------------------------------------

Mosasaurus was a genus of mosasaur, giant carnivorous, aquatic lizards, somewhat resembling flippered crocodiles, with big elongated jaws. This genus existed during the Maastrichtian age of the Cretaceous period (Mesozoic era), around 70–66 million years ago in the area of modern Western Europe and North America in a western interior…

What kind of motion did a mosasaur have?
----------------------------------------

Mosasaurs traveled about the ocean using their long, muscular tails. In some mosasaurs, the tail made up more than half of the body length and could contain 100 vertebrae. A mosasaur would have used a sweeping side-to-side motion to propel themselves through water.

Are there dinosaurs in the Western Interior Seaway?
---------------------------------------------------

The Western Interior Seaway would have covered the Badlands in the Late Cretaceous, when dinosaurs were roaming the earth. However, no dinosaurs appear in the rocks within Badlands National Park. They couldn’t swim into the Western Interior Seaway, so their bones were not preserved as fossils here.

Where are Mosasaurus squamates found in the world?
--------------------------------------------------

Mosasaurus is a genus of mosasaur, giant aquatic squamates that roamed the seas of the Late Cretaceous period. Mosasaurus have been found in parts of Europe and North America.
