What connects Denmark and Sweden?
---------------------------------

Øresund Bridge  
The Øresund Bridge is an approximately 16 km long road and rail link between Sweden and Denmark. It consists of three sections: a bridge, an artificial island and a tunnel.

What is the Øresund?
--------------------

Øresund or The Sound as it is also known in English, is the strait that separates the Danish island Zealand from the southern Swedish province of Scania. Its width is just 4 kilometres at the narrowest point between Kronborg Castle at Helsingør in Denmark, and the northern harbour of Helsingborg in Scania, Sweden.

Is there a bridge that connects Denmark and Sweden?
---------------------------------------------------

This Amazing Bridge Turns Into a Tunnel and Connects Denmark and Sweden The Øresund Bridge is an engineering marvel that connects the Danish capital of Copenhagen to the Swedish city of Malmö. A cable-stayed bridge runs nearly 8 km (5 miles) to an artificial island where it transitions into a tunnel that runs another 4 km (2.5 miles).

Where is the tunnel between Sweden and Denmark?
-----------------------------------------------

The Øresund Bridge runs nearly 8 kilometres (5 miles) from the Swedish coast to the artificial island of Peberholm, which lies in the middle of the strait. The crossing of the strait is completed by a 4 km (2.5-mile) underwater tunnel, called the Drogden Tunnel, from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager.

Why was Øresund important to Denmark and Sweden?
------------------------------------------------

Political control of Øresund has been an important issue in Danish and Swedish history. Denmark maintained military control with the coastal fortress of Kronborg at Elsinore on the west side and Kärnan at Helsingborg on the east, until the eastern shore was ceded to Sweden in 1658, based on the Treaty of Roskilde.

When did the Danish straits become an international waterway?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Copenhagen Convention of 1857 abolished the Dues and made the Danish straits an international waterway . A fixed connection was opened across the strait in 2000, the Øresund Bridge . ^ “Øresund” (US) and “Øresund”. Oxford Dictionaries UK Dictionary. Oxford University Press.
