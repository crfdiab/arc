Why do meteors burn in the mesosphere?
--------------------------------------

Those meteors are burning up in the mesosphere. The meteors make it through the exosphere and thermosphere without much trouble because those layers don’t have much air. But when they hit the mesosphere, there are enough gases to cause friction and create heat.

In which atmospheric layer is most water vapor found?
-----------------------------------------------------

the troposphere  
Most of the water vapor in the atmosphere, along with dust and ash particles, are found in the troposphere—explaining why most of Earth’s clouds are located in this layer. Temperatures in the troposphere decrease with altitude. The stratosphere is the next layer up from Earth’s surface.

Which is the layer of the atmosphere where meteors burn up?
-----------------------------------------------------------

mesosphere— the layer in which most meteors burn up after entering Earth’s atmosphere and before reaching Earth’s surface.

Where does the mesosphere go in the atmosphere?
-----------------------------------------------

As the name suggests, we are halfway up our atmosphere layers when we reach this part. As the name suggests, we are halfway up our atmosphere layers when we reach this part. The mesosphere goes up to 85 km above the surface of our planet, and the temperatures here behave as they do in the troposphere.

Which is the most important layer of the atmosphere?
----------------------------------------------------

mesosphere—the layer in which most meteors burn up after entering Earth’s atmosphere and before reaching Earth’s surface. stratopause—the boundary between the mesophere and the stratosphere. stratosphere—contains the ozone layer; the layer where volcanic gases can affect the climate. tropopause—the boundary between the stratosphere and troposphere.

Which is the boundary between the stratosphere and the troposphere?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

stratopause— the boundary between the mesophere and the stratosphere. stratosphere— contains the ozone layer; the layer where volcanic gases can affect the climate. tropopause— the boundary between the stratosphere and troposphere. troposphere— the layer closest to Earth’s surface in which all weather occurs.
