What group is Rhenium in?
-------------------------

Group 7  
Rhenium (Re), chemical element, a very rare metal of Group 7 (VIIb) of the periodic table and one of the densest elements.

What is Rhenium made of?
------------------------

Commercial rhenium is obtained from molybdenum roaster-flue dusts found in copper-sulfide ores. However, rhenium does not occur freely in nature or as a compound in mineral ores. Molybdenum contains from 0.002 percent to 0.2 percent rhenium, and the element is found widely spread through the Earth’s crust.

What are the physical properties of Rhenium?
--------------------------------------------

Physical properties Rhenium is a ductile, malleable, silvery metal. Ductile means capable of being drawn into thin wires. Malleable means capable of being hammered into thin sheets. It has a density of 21.02 grams per cubic centimeter, a melting point of 3,180°C (5,760°F), and a boiling point of 5,630°C (10,170°F).

Is Rhenium a conductor?
-----------------------

Rhenium is a metal element so it is a good thermal conductor and a good electrical conductor. Rhenium is a shiny solid at standard temperature and pressure and has a high melting point. Rhenium is malleable. Rhenium is sonorous.

Who discovered rhenium first?
-----------------------------

 Ida Noddack  
Otto BergWalter Noddack  
Rhenium/Discoverers

But rhenium was the first to be discovered. It was first isolated in 1925 by Walter and Ida Noddack and Otto Berg in Germany. In the course of an extraction of epic proportions, they processed about 660 kg of the ore molybdenite in order to get just one gram of rhenium.

Is rhenium man made?
--------------------

Rhenium was the lower one and indeed it was the last stable, non-radioactive, naturally-occurring element to be discovered.

How do we use rhenium today?
----------------------------

Rhenium is used as an additive to tungsten- and molybdenum-based alloys to give useful properties. These alloys are used for oven filaments and x-ray machines. It is also used as an electrical contact material as it resists wear and withstands arc corrosion.

What element has 75 neutrons?
-----------------------------

Rhenium  
Rhenium – Element information, properties and uses | Periodic Table.

Is rhenium stronger than tungsten?
----------------------------------

Characteristics. Rhenium is a silvery-white metal with one of the highest melting points of all elements, exceeded by only tungsten and carbon. It also has one of the highest boiling points of all elements, and the highest among stable elements.

How is rhenium classified on the periodic table?
------------------------------------------------

This element is a solid. Rhenium is classified as a “Transition Metal” which are located in Groups 3 – 12 of the Periodic Table. Elements classified as Transition Metals are generally described as ductile, malleable, and able to conduct electricity and heat.Nearly 75% of all the elements in…

What is the melting point of rhenium in Kelvin?
-----------------------------------------------

Rhenium is a silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table. Melting point of Rhenium is 3180°C. Boiling point of Rhenium is 5600°C. Note that, these points are associated with the standard atmospheric pressure. Thermal conductivity of Rhenium is 48 W/ (m·K).

How big is a cubic foot of rhenium?
-----------------------------------

In Imperial or US customary measurement system, the density is equal to 1 310.99 pound per cubic foot \[lb/ft³\], or 12.14 ounce per cubic inch \[oz/inch³\] . Melting Point (MP), Rhenium changes its state from solid to liquid at 3180°C (5756°F or 3453.15K)

Where does rhenium come from in the earths crust?
-------------------------------------------------

It does not occur uncombined in nature or as a compound in a mineable mineral species. It is, however, widely spread throughout the Earth’s crust to the extent of about 0.001 parts per million. Commercial production of rhenium is by extraction from the flue dusts of molybdenum smelters.
