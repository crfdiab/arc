<h2 id=what-type-of-speech-is-not-protected-by-the-bill-of-rights>What type of speech is not protected by the Bill of Rights?</h2>
<p>Obscenity. Fighting words. Defamation (including libel and slander) Child pornography.</p>
<h2 id=is-political-speech-free-speech>Is political speech free speech?</h2>
<p>In the United States, freedom of speech and expression is strongly protected from government restrictions by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, many state constitutions, and state and federal laws.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-first-amendment-cover-political-speech>Does the First Amendment cover political speech?</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court has long considered political and ideological speech to be at the core of the First Amendment, including speech concerning “politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion.” W. Political speech can take other forms beyond the written or spoken word, such as money, e.g., Buckley v.</p>
<h2 id=is-political-speech-protected>Is political speech protected?</h2>
<p>Public employees are protected by state and federal constitutional provisions, while workers at private companies are subject to their employers’ rules on political speech. One exception is if the private employer receives federal financial assistance.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-limits-on-free-speech>What are the limits on free speech?</h2>
<p>Freedom of speech and expression, therefore, may not be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, food labeling, non- …</p>
<h2 id=why-is-political-speech-so-protected>Why is political speech so protected?</h2>
<p>Political speech, being the most protected form of speech under the First Amendment, warrants the highest level of scrutiny against the laws that regulate it. In these decisions, the court did not deviate from the established-by-common-law approach to political speech protection.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-considered-political-speech>What is considered political speech?</h2>
<p>Expressions which comment on government action rather than the private conduct of an individual. Expressive activity is political if its point is to comment on government action, including criticizing the conduct of an official acting under color of law. …</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-bill-of-rights-say-about-free-speech>What does the Bill of Rights say about free speech?</h2>
<p>Article I. Section 6. of the Constitution states concerning the Members of Congress “and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.” With Amendment I, free speech was universally guaranteed to We the People. Remember, with freedom however also comes responsibility.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-have-freedom-of-speech>Why is it important to have freedom of speech?</h2>
<p>While desirable in theory, truly free speech would open up vulnerable people to intimidation and attack. Some restriction upon speech facilitates the operation of a representative and responsible democracy by fostering an environment in which marginalised people feel safe to speak up.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-government-allowed-to-regulate-protected-speech>Is the government allowed to regulate protected speech?</h2>
<p>At the same time, the Supreme Court, as well as many government and nonprofit agencies, have contributed to the definition of protected speech as well. As a broad rule, virtually all other types of speech are protected, but the government may be able to regulate speech in certain circumstances.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-freedom-of-speech-codified-in-the-constitution>How is the freedom of speech codified in the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Freedom of Speech was first codified for the privileged class of government leaders in both the Articles of Confederation and then in the Constitution. Article I. Section 6. of the Constitution states concerning the Members of Congress “and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.”</p>
