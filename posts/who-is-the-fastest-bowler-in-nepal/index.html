<p>The fastest bowlers propel the ball at speeds in excess of 90mph. At the point of release, they are just shy of 19 metres away from their intended target. That’s if the intended target is the wooden stumps.</p>
<h2 id=what-speed-do-fast-bowlers-bowl-at>What speed do fast bowlers bowl at?</h2>
<p>Fast bowlers in cricket can constantly bowl around the speed of 145kmph i.e. about 90mph. A batsman gets about 0.5 seconds to react to the delivery once released from the bowler’s hand.</p>

<h2 id=can-a-bowler-bowl-2-overs-in-a-row>Can a bowler bowl 2 overs in a row?</h2>
<p>It is indeed forbidden for a bowler to bowl two overs in a row. Please note that it used to be possible, as explained by Gerald Brodribb in Next Man In. Until 1889, it was not possible for a bowler to change his bowling end more than twice in an innings, and he was allowed to bowl two consecutive overs to change ends.</p>

<p>For comparison, spin bowlers bowl at average speeds of 70 to 90 km/h (45 to 55 mph). Some bowlers have the ability to deliver a variation ball. This ball is faster or slower than their standard deliveries. They use it as a weapon to surprise the batsmen.</p>
