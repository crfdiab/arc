<h2 id=how-dangerous-is-the-cape-of-good-hope>How dangerous is the Cape of Good Hope?</h2>
<p>Notorious for its violently stormy conditions, huge waves of over five metres as well as wind speeds in excess of 30 knots make sailing around the rocky headland which sits between the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans a perilous task. Freak waves make sailing difficult, unpredictable cross currents even more so.</p>
<h2 id=is-cape-of-good-hope-a-country>Is Cape of Good Hope a country?</h2>
<p>Cape of Good Hope, rocky promontory at the southern end of Cape Peninsula, Western Cape province, South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-cape-of-good-hope-so-dangerous>Why is Cape of Good Hope so dangerous?</h2>
<p>The waters near the Cape, where the Atlantic and Indian Oceans meet, can be treacherous for ships. The warm Agulhas current from the east runs into the cold Benguela current from the northwest. Dangerous waves from these currents have caused many shipwrecks.</p>
<h2 id=is-cape-of-good-hope-treacherous>Is Cape of Good Hope treacherous?</h2>
<p>South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope has claimed thousands of ships—and remains treacherous today. The southern route is also considerably more dangerous: Fierce winds, rocky outcrops, and heavy shipping traffic through history have made the Cape of Good Hope one of the world’s most treacherous ship graveyards.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-bartholomew-diaz-call-the-southern-tip-of-africa-the-cape-of-storms>Why did Bartholomew Diaz call the southern tip of Africa the Cape of storms?</h2>
<p>On the journey back, Dias observed the southernmost point of Africa, later called Cabo das Agulhas, or Cape of Needles. Dias named the rocky second cape Cabo das Tormentas (Cape of Storms) for the tempestuous storms and strong Atlantic-Antarctic currents that made ship travel so perilous.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-tip-of-africa-called>What is the tip of Africa called?</h2>
<p>Cape Agulhas, Africa’s southernmost point, is Portuguese for Cape of Needles. Historians think the name may be a reference to the needle-like rock formations and reefs along its coast.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-worse-cape-horn-or-cape-of-good-hope>Which is worse Cape Horn or Cape of Good Hope?</h2>
<p>Cape Horn is not the world’s most dangerous place to sail. A more dangerous area is Cape Agulhas on the coast of South Africa, just east of the Cape of Good Hope, along which the Agulhas Current flows. The need for boats and ships to round Cape Horn was greatly reduced by the opening of the Panama Canal in August 1914.</p>
<h2 id=which-cape-is-more-dangerous>Which Cape is more dangerous?</h2>
<p>A more dangerous area is Cape Agulhas on the coast of South Africa, just east of the Cape of Good Hope, along which the Agulhas Current flows. In sailing, the great capes are three major capes of the continents in the Southern Ocean — Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, Australia’s Cape Leeuwin, and South America’s Cape Horn.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-dangerous-cape>What is the most dangerous cape?</h2>
<p>Cape Horn<br>
No other sea route in the world has claimed so many lives as the journey around Cape Horn where the Atlantic meets the Pacific. Since it was first successfully navigated in 1616, the cape was, for a long time, one of the most feared sea routes in the world. Even in today’s high-tech age, it remains a dangerous place.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-did-bartholomew-diaz-sail-on-his-voyage>How far did Bartholomew Diaz sail on his voyage?</h2>
<p>16,000 miles<br>
In Lisbon, after 15 months at sea and a journey of nearly 16,000 miles, the returning mariners were met by triumphant crowds. In a private meeting with the king, however, Dias was forced to explain his failure to meet up with Paiva and Covilhã.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-cape-of-good-hope-in-south-africa>Is the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa?</h2>
<p>The Cape of Good Hope is a narrow, rocky piece of land that juts out into the South Atlantic Ocean, found in South Africa’s Cape Peninsula. The Cape of Good Hope is part of the Table Mountain National Park, and contrary to popular belief, is not actually the southernmost point of Africa, as that title goes to Cape Agulhas.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-birds-live-on-the-cape-of-good-hope>What kind of birds live on the Cape of Good Hope?</h2>
<p>With its diverse habitat, ranging from rocky mountain tops to beaches and open sea, the Cape of Good Hope is home to at least 250 species of birds including one of the two mainland colonies of African penguins.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-visit-the-cape-of-good-hope>Who was the first person to visit the Cape of Good Hope?</h2>
<p>Reproduction of the Cross of Vasco da Gama at the Cape of Good Hope. In the Early Modern Era, the first European to reach the cape was the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias on 12 March 1488, who named it the “Cape of Storms” ( Cabo das Tormentas ).</p>
<h2 id=is-the-cape-of-good-hope-a-ghost-ship>Is the Cape of Good Hope a ghost ship?</h2>
<p>By legend, the Cape of Good Hope is the haunted location of the ghostly ship The Flying Dutchman, which is said to be cursed so that it can never reach land. Tagged Africa, Facts, Landform, Rocks, Water. Bookmark the permalink.</p>
