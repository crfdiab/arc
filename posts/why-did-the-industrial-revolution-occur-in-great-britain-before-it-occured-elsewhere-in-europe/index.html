<h2 id=why-did-the-industrial-revolution-occur-in-great-britain-before-it-occured-elsewhere-in-europe>Why did the Industrial Revolution occur in Great Britain before it occured elsewhere in Europe?</h2>
<p>Why did the Industrial Revolution occur in Great Britain before it occurred elsewhere in Europe? They were close to the sea, no part of Britain was very far from the sea. They also had modernized transportation like canals, unlike continental Europe. They had rich deposits of coal and iron.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-industrial-revolution-first-occur-in-britain>Why did Industrial Revolution first occur in Britain?</h2>
<p>The first Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain after 1750. The profits Britain had enjoyed due to booming cotton and trade industries allowed investors to support the construction of factories. British entrepreneurs interested in taking risks to make profits were leading the charge of industrialization.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-industrial-revolution-first-started-in-britain-but-not-in-other-countries>Why did Industrial Revolution first started in Britain but not in other countries?</h2>
<p>Britain was rich with natural resources. Iron and coal proved twin pillars of Industrial Revolution and Britain was lucky to have them in close proximity. If not then their colonial policy fulfil their need of resources.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-industrial-revolution-start-in-europe-and-not-elsewhere>Why did the Industrial Revolution start in Europe and not elsewhere?</h2>
<p>The industrial revolution in Europe didn’t happen overnight but only spread over the continent very gradually. One of the triggers was the unusually high growth in the population which set in around the middle of the 18th century and produced a gigantic reservoir of workers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-british-change-as-a-result-of-the-industrial-revolution>How did British change as a result of the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>More efficient, mechanized production meant Britain’s new textile factories could meet the growing demand for cloth both at home and abroad, where the nation’s many overseas colonies provided a captive market for its goods. In addition to textiles, the British iron industry also adopted new innovations.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-significant-cause-of-the-industrial-revolution>What was the most significant cause of the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>The development of trade and the rise of business were among the major causes of the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-industrial-revolution-begin-in-england>Why did the Industrial Revolution begin in England?</h2>
<p>The Industrial Revolution began in Britain because it possessed superior financial assets, a more stable governmental structure and a huge supply of natural resources that were necessary for the revolution to take place. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, England partook in more trade overseas than any other European nation.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-europe-come-before-asia-in-the-industrial-revolution>Why did Europe come before Asia in the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>Firstly, the role of geography has been used by historians to answer why Europe came before Asia. It is argued that Britain had a climatic advantage over China due to its mild weather and constant rainfall. Moderate weather conditions protected Europe against disease and drought, capital damaging disasters.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-first-country-to-experience-the-industrial-revolution>Which is the first country to experience the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>Although the Industrial Revolution occurred relatively fast on a global scale, Britain was the first nation to truly experience industrialization and only after did other nations follow.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-travel-like-before-the-industrial-revolution>What was travel like before the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>Travel was very difficult before the Industrial Revolution as there was no means of mechanised transport. By the turn of the Twentieth Century this had changed dramatically.</p>
