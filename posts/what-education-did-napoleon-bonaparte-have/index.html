Napoleon Bonaparte/Education</p>
<h2 id=what-did-napoleon-study-in-paris>What did Napoleon study in Paris?</h2>
<p>On completion of his studies at Brienne in 1784, Napoleon was admitted to the École Militaire in Paris. He trained to become an artillery officer and, when his father’s death reduced his income, was forced to complete the two-year course in one year. He was the first Corsican to graduate from the École Militaire.</p>
<h2 id=did-napoleon-get-a-scholarship>Did Napoleon get a scholarship?</h2>
<p>Napoleon Bonaparte was born on the Mediterranean island of Corsica on August 15, 1769. France rewarded his services graciously, and financed a scholarship for the young Napoleon to the military college of Brienne in France. Napoleon left to begin his education there in 1777, at the age of eight.</p>
<h2 id=did-napoleon-do-well-in-school>Did Napoleon do well in school?</h2>
<p>The effort did not go well. Napoleon found memorizing difficult, and his natural inclination to hurry did not do him well in the study of language. Worse yet, his French had (and always would have) a strong Corsican accent, a fact that did him no favors throughout his schooling.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-napoleon-when-he-became-a-officer>How old was Napoleon when he became a officer?</h2>
<p>Aged 15, Napoleon was admitted to the elite École Militaire in Paris, but was forced to complete the two-year course in just one after his father died of stomach cancer, leaving Napoleon as the family’s chief source of income. He became a commissioned officer just after his 16th birthday.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-napoleon-bonaparte-study-in-high-school>What did Napoleon Bonaparte study in high school?</h2>
<p>Napoleon did not graduate at the top of his class at the Ecole Militaire. He did, however, spend considerable time reading classics, history and geography while in Valence. Describe the changes Napoleon made in France as First Consul and then Emperor.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-napoleon-bonaparte-important-to-the-french-revolution>Why was Napoleon Bonaparte important to the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>It saved time when preparing for exams. In this lesson, we’ll explore the life and times of one of history’s great leaders, Napoleon Bonaparte. We’ll learn about his role in the French Revolution, his ability as a military leader, and his eventual downfall and exile. Perhaps the best way to start this lesson is with a story: It was March 7, 1815.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-napoleon-studied-during-the-napoleonic-wars>Where was Napoleon studied during the Napoleonic Wars?</h2>
<p>His military exploits during the Napoleonic Wars are still studied at West Point and the Royal Military Academy/Sandhurst military schools in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812 and suffered a horrible defeat, largely due to a severe winter.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-personality-traits-did-napoleon-bonaparte-have>What kind of personality traits did Napoleon Bonaparte have?</h2>
<p>The Personality Traits that Led to Napoleon Bonaparte’s Epic Downfall. Napoleon Bonaparte’s rise and fall are one of the most spectacular in recorded history. The French general and statesman turned self-appointed emperor revolutionized the nation’s military, legal and educational institutions.</p>
