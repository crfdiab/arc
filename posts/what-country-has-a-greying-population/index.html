<p>This increase has been called “the graying of America,” a term that describes the phenomenon of a larger and larger percentage of the population getting older and older.

<p>Graying – A term used to indicate that an increasing proportion of a society’s population is elderly. (Adults ages 65 and older) Graying is the result of two long-term trends in industrial societies: the tendency of families to have fewer children and the fact that people are living longer.</p>

<h2 id=how-will-the-graying-of-america-look>How will the graying of America look?</h2>
<p>In less than two decades, the graying of America will be inescapable: Older adults are projected to outnumber kids for the first time in U.S. history. Already, the middle-aged outnumber children, but the country will reach a new milestone in 2034 (previously 2035).</p>

<h2 id=do-you-think-a-graying-population-is-a-good-or-a-bad-thing-for-a-region>Do you think a graying population is a good or a bad thing for a region?</h2>
