<p>More than 60,000 people are reported to have been involved in the revolt, and not all of them were peasants: soldiers and tradesmen as well as some disillusioned churchmen, including one Peasant leader known as ‘the mad priest of Kent’, John Ball.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-peasants-ever-revolt>Did the peasants ever revolt?</h2>
<p>Peasants’ Revolt, also called Wat Tyler’s Rebellion, (1381), first great popular rebellion in English history. Its immediate cause was the imposition of the unpopular poll tax of 1380, which brought to a head the economic discontent that had been growing since the middle of the century.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-peasants-died-in-the-german-peasants-revolt>How many peasants died in the German peasants revolt?</h2>
<p>100,000 peasants<br>
Although the revolt was supported by Huldrych Zwingli and Thomas Müntzer, its condemnation by Martin Luther contributed to its defeat, principally by the army of the Swabian League. Some 100,000 peasants were killed.</p>

<h2 id=why-did-the-peasants-revolt-fail>Why did the peasants revolt fail?</h2>
<p>The major reasons that Peasants’ Revolt failed could be summarized as: Lack of Leadership and planning. Watt Tyler was not a natural leader and lacked the ability to control those taking part. Furthermore, there appears to have been no orchestrated plans of action.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-german-peasants-revolt-fail>Why did the German peasants revolt fail?</h2>
<p>It failed because of intense opposition from the aristocracy, who slaughtered up to 100,000 of the 300,000 poorly armed peasants and farmers. The German Peasants’ War was Europe’s largest and most widespread popular uprising prior to the French Revolution of 1789. The fighting was at its height in the middle of 1525.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-martin-luther-respond-to-german-peasants-war>How did Martin Luther respond to German peasants war?</h2>
<p>Luther was at first sympathetic to the peasants’ cause, and he castigated their lords as tyrannical. As the rebellion escalated to violence, Luther took a harsher stance on the peasants, whom he now condemned as robbers and rebels to be killed on sight, as illuminated by the third passage.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-peasants-want-in-the-peasants-revolt>What did the peasants want in the Peasants Revolt?</h2>
<p>The peasants went home, but later government troops toured the villages hanging men who had taken part in the Revolt. Although the Revolt was defeated, its demands – less harsh laws, money for the poor, freedom and equality – all became part of democracy in the long term. The Peasants’ Revolt was a popular uprising.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-were-killed-in-the-peasants-revolt>How many people were killed in the Peasants Revolt?</h2>
<p>Troubles extended north to York, Beverley and Scarborough, and as far west as Bridgwater in Somerset. Richard mobilised 4,000 soldiers to restore order. Most of the rebel leaders were tracked down and executed; by November, at least 1,500 rebels had been killed. The Peasants’ Revolt has been widely studied by academics.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-peasants-revolt-against-richard-ii>When did the peasants revolt against Richard II?</h2>
<p>In 1381 the peasants revolted against King Richard II. This is known as the Peasants’ Revolt.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-peasants-revolt-in-essex-and-kent>Why did the Peasants Revolt in Essex and Kent?</h2>
<p>Whipped up by the preaching of radical priest John Ball, they were demanding that all men should be free and equal; for less harsh laws; and a fairer distribution of wealth. Soon both Essex and Kent were in revolt. The rebels coordinated their tactics by letter. They marched in London, where they destroyed the houses of government ministers.</p>
