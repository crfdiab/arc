<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-we-have-nothing-to-fear-but-fear-itself>What is meant by we have nothing to fear but fear itself?</h2>
<p>Roosevelt used this phrase, “nothing to fear but fear itself.” That speech was charged with the rhetorics of hope and courage. This phrase, “nothing to fear but fear itself”, is a reference to the sensation of fear that is the worst enemy of humankind. It keeps one aback and troubles one’s soul.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-thoreau-say-about-fear>What did Thoreau say about fear?</h2>
<p>Thoreau had written the sentence, “Nothing is so much to be feared as fear,” in his journal entry for September 7, 1851, in passing, as part of his comment on his contemporaries’ criticisms of Harriet Martineau’s arguments for atheism in her just-published Letters on the Laws of Man’s Nature and Development.</p>
<h2 id=what-we-need-to-fear-is-fear-itself>What we need to fear is fear itself?</h2>
<p>So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is…fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.</p>
<h2 id=what-central-idea-does-roosevelt-develop-in-these-paragraphs>What central idea does Roosevelt develop in these paragraphs?</h2>
<p>President Roosevelt develops the idea of how imperialist Japan is a threat to the whole international community in paragraphs 1–14 of the speech excerpt. He strongly condemns Japan’s treachery and bombing of the American Island of Oahu, Hawai on the 7th of December, 1941.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-say-we-have-nothing-to-fear-except-fear-itself>Who was the first person to say we have nothing to fear except Fear Itself?</h2>
<p>In the sixteenth century, the great French writer Michel de Montaigne (pictured right) – the man who pretty much invented a whole new genre, the essay – wrote: ‘the thing of which I have most fear is fear’. Although it depends on which translation you read.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-thing-in-the-world-i-am-most-afraid-of>What is the thing in the world I am most afraid of?</h2>
<p>Although it depends on which translation you read. In another, the wording is slightly different: ‘The thing in the world I am most afraid of is fear, that passion alone, in the trouble of it, exceeding all other accidents.’</p>
<h2 id=is-the-only-thing-we-have-to-fear-is-nature>Is the only thing we have to fear is nature?</h2>
<p>Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered, because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-henry-david-thoreau-say-nothing-to-fear-except-fear-itself>When did Henry David Thoreau say nothing to fear except Fear Itself?</h2>
<p>Then, in the nineteenth century and in yet another country, the United States, Henry David Thoreau offered in his journal entry for 7 September 1851: ‘Nothing is so much to be feared as fear.’ The context was an entry about atheism:</p>
