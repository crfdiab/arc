<h2 id=how-is-ochre-mixed>How is ochre mixed?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, ochre was mixed with a variety of substances to form a paint or coating to preserve Indigenous implements and weapons. Some of the substances ochre was traditionally combined with included sap, honey, egg, blood, saliva, animal fat and water.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-aboriginal-ochre-made-of>What is Aboriginal ochre made of?</h2>
<p>Ochre is mainly composed of yellowish limonite, itself a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides, mixed with clays and sand. Red ochres naturally form in areas with high haematite concentrations.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-aboriginals-make-yellow-paint>How did Aboriginals make yellow paint?</h2>
<p>Aboriginal tribes would typically use ochre or iron clay pigments to make colours like yellow, brown and red for their paints, and charcoal to make black.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-ochre-smell-like>What does ochre smell like?</h2>
<p>They did it long before modern man developed significant artistic skills and interest in sophisticated rituals. Ochre, iron oxide, under sunlight on the moist skin, generates aggressive chemicals. They transform body smell into odourless carbon dioxide and sterilize the skin from bacteria.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-red-ochre-symbolism>What does red ochre symbolism?</h2>
<p>Uses and symbols As a bright red pigment, it’s possible that ancient people saw ochre as a symbol of life, in part because it is the color of blood, especially deep-red menstrual blood. “Some societies quite commonly associate the color red, and therefore ochre, with creation, life and fertility,” Pettitt said.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-australian-aboriginal-people-use-ochre>Why did the Australian Aboriginal people use ochre?</h2>
<p>They’ve still retained the use of ochre pigments for their ceremonial dances and corroborees. Ochre still has a spiritual significance to Indigenous people and has that ancient connection that goes back unbroken for tens of thousands of years. The use of ochre underpins, to a large extent, Indigenous art and culture from all around Australia.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-find-ochre-in-western-australia>Where can you find ochre in Western Australia?</h2>
<p>These colors include red, pink, yellow, white and Blue which is rare and is found in caves and along the coast. Most ochre is found between the Kimberleys in Western Australia and Alice Springs in the center of the Northern Territory.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-pigments-do-aboriginal-people-use>What kind of pigments do Aboriginal people use?</h2>
<p>Even with the body paintings that still carries on the ancient traditions of using ochre pigments. This is true too of other communities which have embraced acrylics and synthetic polymers for their paintings. They’ve still retained the use of ochre pigments for their ceremonial dances and corroborees.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-yellow-ochre-different-from-red-ochre>How is yellow ochre different from red ochre?</h2>
<p>Purple ochre is identical to red ochre in composition, but refracts light differently due to a larger average particle size. Yellow ochre is limonite (hydrated iron oxide). With heat treatment the composition of yellow ochre may be altered, resulting in the production of orange, red, and umber ochres.</p>
