<h2 id=what-four-nations-claimed-parts-of-the-area-between-the-mississippi-river-and-the-pacific-ocean>What four nations claimed parts of the area between the Mississippi River and the Pacific Ocean?</h2>
<p>Spain, Russia, Great Britain, and the U.S. When people moved west, they needed to go down the Mississippi River, but the Spanish closed the port, angering settlers.</p>
<h2 id=who-claimed-louisiana-and-the-mississippi-river-and-what-territory-did-the-claim-include>Who claimed Louisiana and the Mississippi River and what territory did the claim include?</h2>
<p>The Louisiana Purchase (1803) was a land deal between the United States and France, in which the U.S. acquired approximately 827,000 square miles of land west of the Mississippi River for $15 million.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-territory-including-the-region-of-the-mississippi-river>What is the territory including the region of the Mississippi River?</h2>
<p>Louisiana Territory<br>
The Louisiana Territory was vast, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico in the south to Rupert’s Land in the north, and from the Mississippi River in the east to the Rocky Mountains in the west. Acquiring the territory doubled the size of the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-controlled-territory-to-the-north-of-the-us-boundary-to-the-south-and-west>What country controlled territory to the north of the US boundary to the south and west?</h2>
<p>READ MORE: Why France Sold the Louisiana Purchase to the US In 1762, during the French and Indian War, France ceded its America territory west of the Mississippi River to Spain and in 1763 transferred nearly all of its remaining North American holdings to Great Britain.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-british-territory-south-of-the-mississippi>What was the British territory south of the Mississippi?</h2>
<p>The Kingdom of Great Britain recognized the territory south of what is now Canada, east of the Mississippi and north of Florida as American property. Vermont remained independent until 1791. France regained Saint Pierre and Miquelon in 1783 after the Peace of Paris and some residents returned to the islands.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-treaty-that-ended-the-french-and-indian-war>What was the treaty that ended the French and Indian War?</h2>
<p>February 10, 1763 The 1763 Treaty of Paris ended the French and Indian War / Seven Years’ War. It was signed by Great Britain, France and Spain, with Portugal in agreement. Preferring to keep Guadeloupe, France gave up Canada and all of its claims to territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-claim-the-pacific-northwest>How did the US claim the Pacific Northwest?</h2>
<p>During this phase, the U.S. established claims to the territory, through exploration, trading fur, and occupation of land, and these claims would eventually give the U.S. a stake in the Pacific Northwest that it otherwise would not have had.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-frances-territory-in-north-america-in-1803>What was France’s territory in North America in 1803?</h2>
<p>Throughout this period, France maintained the small North American territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon off the coast of the island of Newfoundland. From independence, the United States expanded rapidly to the west, acquiring the massive Louisiana territory in 1803 and fighting a war with Mexico to push west to the Pacific.</p>
