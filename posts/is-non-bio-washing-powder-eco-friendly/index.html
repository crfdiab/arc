<h2 id=is-non-bio-washing-powder-eco-friendly>Is non-bio washing powder eco-friendly?</h2>
<p>Ecover Fragrance Free Non-Bio Washing Powder is the first of Ecover’s fragrance free products to hit the UK stores. It is both eco-friendly and dermatologically tested for sensitive skin. With packaging that is 100 per cent recyclable, this powder is an ultra green, affordable choice that works well at 30 degrees.</p>

<h2 id=is-bio-classic-washing-powder-biodegradable>Is Bio classic washing powder biodegradable?</h2>
<p>This detergent is biodegradable, phosphate free and is also not tested on animals. A 1kg bag costs about R30 (what?!) and lasts me 3 to 4 months. My friend and her family all have really sensitive skin and this detergent seemed to irritate their skin a little.</p>
<h2 id=does-bio-washing-powder-fade-clothes>Does bio washing powder fade clothes?</h2>
<p>Bio detergents can cause some fading to clothes, though there are other factors that come into play, such as the agitation of the wash cycle and the heat and action of the dryer.</p>
<h2 id=is-bio-washing-liquid-bad-for-the-environment>Is bio washing liquid bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>The environmental impact is not so clear. Whilst the enzymes contained in a biological detergent may take longer to disperse within the environment, the temperatures for washing can be lower than for a non-biological powder.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-environmentally-friendly-detergent>What is the most environmentally friendly detergent?</h2>
<p>These are the best eco-friendly laundry detergents we tested, ranked in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common Good Laundry Detergent.</li>
<li>Biokleen Laundry Liquid.</li>
<li>Greenshield Organic.</li>
<li>Charlie’s Soap.</li>
<li>Indigo Wild Zum Clean Laundry Soap.</li>
<li>Boulder Clean.</li>
<li>Ecos Free & Clear.</li>
<li>Eco Nuts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=which-is-more-eco-friendly-washing-powder-or-liquid>Which is more eco friendly washing powder or liquid?</h2>
<p>Powder is bulkier and costs more to transport, but its cardboard packaging is easier to recycle, or re-use as mulch on weeds. Liquid detergent uses more water, and its large plastic bottles are a burden for waste centres. The hard plastic box that the sachets come in is seldom recyclable.</p>
<h2 id=is-bio-or-non-bio-better-for-environment>Is Bio or non-bio better for environment?</h2>
<p>Biological detergents can therefore be more effective at removing stains. A non-biological detergent does not contain enzymes but this is better for sensitive skin. The environmental impact is not so clear. The non-bio detergent may require a higher temperature for the same effect, therefore using more energy.</p>
<h2 id=is-bio-detergent-bad-for-environment>Is bio detergent bad for environment?</h2>
<p>The enzymes in biological detergents, such as lipase, amylase and protease, do a great job of breaking down the fat and protein molecules that we leave on our clothes and linen, but once flushed into the watercourse they can, along with the phosphates found in these detergents, continue their active pursuit of such …</p>
<h2 id=is-bio-better-than-non-bio>Is Bio better than non-bio?</h2>
<p>Biological washing powder and liquids contain enzymes. These help to break down fat, grease and proteins to get clothes clean. Non-bio doesn’t contain enzymes so is generally gentler, making it a better choice for sensitive skin.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-biodegradable-and-non-biodegradeable-wastes>What’s the difference between biodegradable and non-biodegradeable wastes?</h2>
<p>Unlike biodegradable wastes, non-biodegradable cannot be easily handled. Non-biodegradable wastes are those who cannot be decomposed or dissolved by natural agents.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-bio-and-non-bio-washing-powders>What’s the difference between BIO and non bio washing powders?</h2>
<p>Discover the key differences between bio and non-bio washing powders, based on the results of our independent lab tests. Every year we put bio and non-bio washing powders, liquid detergents and liquid capsules through tough tests to sort the best products from those you should avoid.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-good-to-burn-non-biodegradable-materials>Is it good to burn non biodegradable materials?</h2>
<p>Therefore, we can all agree, burning them to minimize landfills is not a good option either. When non-biodegradable materials are exposed to air and water for quite an extended period, they release toxic pollutants. For instance, plastics may oxidize and issue out poisonous salts which are carcinogenic.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-bio-or-non-bio-detergent>Which is better bio or non bio detergent?</h2>
<p>This helps save money and energy (as otherwise you would have to use a higher temperature wash). Bio detergents will always outperform non-bio detergents at lower temperatures, from 30° C to 50°C, and they are better for quick washes as well.</p>
