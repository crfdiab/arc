<h2 id=are-there-any-dangerous-fish-in-lake-mead>Are there any dangerous fish in Lake Mead?</h2>
<p>Lake Mead Sharks are real and they’re dangerous. This is the true part: Lake Mead was created by Hoover Dam and covers parts of Arizona and Nevada. … The monster part comes from a story that, not long after the crash, a man was caught releasing alligators into Lake Mead.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-fish-with-corn-in-nevada>Is it illegal to fish with corn in Nevada?</h2>
<p>Chumming is allowed, using anything except game fish or parts of game fish. Anchovies and corn are a favorite chum. Fish over chum at least an hour then move to a different spot.</p>

<p>Bold long and slender with the dorsal and anal fins well back towards the tail. Found in a few eastern Nevada reservoirs including Bassett and Comins lakes.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fish-live-in-lake-mead>What kind of fish live in Lake Mead?</h2>
<p>The native fish that once swam in the warm silty waters of the Colorado River became the first residents of a clearer, cooler Lake Mead. This new habitat soon became home to fish transported from other regions and habitats to provide recreational fishing opportunities.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-are-northern-pike-in-dalemead-lake>How big are northern pike in Dalemead Lake?</h2>
<p>A northern pike from Dalemead lake. Although I have fished from shore my best results were using an inflatable boat to get out past the ample weed banks along the north shore. At the edge of those weed banks the depth is about 6-8 feet and drops off to 15 or so feet. Further out the deepest area I measured was over 30 feet.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-they-put-threadfin-shad-in-lake-mead>Why did they put threadfin shad in Lake Mead?</h2>
<p>But all of these new fish needed something to eat, so in 1954 biologists from Nevada, Arizona, and California decided to stock the lake with a smaller fish, threadfin shad, which could serve as a food source. Over the next decade, the water levels in Lake Mead began to change as its upstream neighbor, Lake Powell, was filled.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-pike-drop-off-in-a-lake>Where do Pike drop off in a lake?</h2>
<p>This area has a very thick growth of weeds with a few channels heading out into the lake. You can fish here but, be sure to use a weedless set up or be prepared for a lot of snags. There are plenty of smaller pike in this area. About 100 feet from shore is where it drops off from 6 to 8 feet to 15 feet.</p>
