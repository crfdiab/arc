<h2 id=what-is-on-the-ncr-flag>What is on the NCR flag?</h2>
<p>When asked where the original NCR capital was located, you answer Shady Sands. And when asked what the NCR’s flag is emblazoned with, you answer a double-headed bear.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-most-famous-person-in-ncr-history>Who is the most famous person in NCR history?</h2>
<p>Q1 – Tandi is the most popular NCR president in history. Q2 – Shady Sands was the original name of the NCR Capitol.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-kill-orris>Can I kill Orris?</h2>
<p>Killing Orris after talking to him about not killing the thugs will not affect the outcome of the quest. In fact, if Orris is killed prior to initiating the G.I. Blues quest, it will not fail the quest. Instead, the Courier can admit to killing him to the King when seeking work, skipping this portion of the quest.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-accidentally-kill-pacer>How do you accidentally kill Pacer?</h2>
<p>While working as a guard, when Pacer comes and talks to the player character, pick a fight with him by using hostile dialogue options such as the third option in the first dialogue and “Care to back that up?” in the second. This will make him hostile. Kill him with the energy weapon given by the Van Graffs.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-most-liked-president-in-the-ncr>Who was the most liked president in the NCR?</h2>
<p>Question 1 – Who is the most popular NCR President of all time? President Tandi.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-ncr-questions>What are the NCR questions?</h2>
<p>Correct answers to the questions: Question 1 – President Tandi. Question 2 – Shady Sands. Question 3 – Two-Headed Bear….The NCR</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1 – Who is the most popular NCR President of all time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2 – What was the original name of the capital of the NCR?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id=question-3--what-animal-is-on-the-ncr-flag-what-is-the-best-brain-for-rex>Question 3 – What animal is on the NCR Flag? What is the best brain for Rex?</h2>
<p>If you want to have an offensive type Rex then you can get Rey’s Brain. If you want a Speed type Rex go get Violetta’s Brain. If you want a Tough Rex then go get Lupa’s Brain.</p>
<h2 id=should-i-kill-caleb-mccaffery>Should I kill Caleb Mccaffery?</h2>
<p>Bugs. If you request for Caleb’s hat and then kill him without equipping the hat, it will become permanently embedded in your inventory, unable to remove as it is a quest item and cannot be given to the Garrets because they are quite happy he’s dead.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-negotiate-with-ncr>How do you negotiate with NCR?</h2>
<p>Head to the train station in northwest Freeside and try to negotiate with the NCR. Return to the King and let him know the situation with the NCR has been taken care of. Return to the King and let him know the situation with the NCR has been defused.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-tips-does-rotface-have>How many tips does Rotface have?</h2>
<p>30<br>
When the Courier first meets him, Rotface will sell him up to 30 simple tips for one bottle cap each (beside the special quest related tips, see “Quests”). The first tip (which is in fact two in one, as he states) is about the Kings.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-ncr-test>What is the NCR test?</h2>
<p>The test is comprised of three questions, the answers to which are considered common knowledge among NCR citizens. If “you” are really an NCR citizen, then you would surely know the correct answers to all three questions, at least, that’s the premise. You can take the test over and over as many times as you like.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-put-your-brain-in-rex>Can you put your brain in Rex?</h2>
<p>Quest stages Acquire a new brain for Rex from one of Old Lady Gibson’s dogs. (Optional) Search for an exceptional canine brain among Caesar’s Legion. (Optional) Search for an exceptional canine brain among the Fiends. Return to Jacobstown and have Rex’s brain transplant performed.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-original-name-of-the-ncr-capital>What was the original name of the NCR capital?</h2>
<p>Okay, next question – what was the original name of the NCR capital – The Boneyard, Shady Sands, Aradesh, or Vault 13?” Missionary is the name given to at least two characters living in Freeside in 2281 .</p>
<h2 id=how-to-prove-you-are-a-citizen-of-the-ncr>How to prove you are a citizen of the NCR?</h2>
<p>Either will ask the player character if they are a citizen of the NCR. If the Courier answers “yes”, the Courier is quizzed with three questions to prove that they are an NCR citizen. Question 1 – Who is the most popular NCR President of all time?</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-popular-president-in-ncr-history>Which is the most popular president in NCR history?</h2>
<p>Q3, Choice 1 – A Two-Headed Bear. Once again, the correct answers: Q1 – Tandi is the most popular NCR president in history. Q2 – Shady Sands was the original name of the NCR Capitol. Q3 – A Two-Headed Bear is the animal on the NCR flag.</p>
