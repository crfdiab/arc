<h2 id=how-did-the-convicts-survive-in-australia>How did the convicts survive in Australia?</h2>
<p>Convicts lived in their own homes in an area known as ‘The Rocks’, some with their families. But it wasn’t just convicts living in the village; local Aboriginal people lived there too. They camped near the convict houses, fished on the harbour, traded goods and food with townsfolk and brought news from further away.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-convicts-survive-on-the-first-fleet>How did the convicts survive on the First Fleet?</h2>
<p>As a result, they were kept below deck in the foul, cramped holds. Some convicts on the Scarborough planned a mutiny but were caught, but most convicts were well behaved. On 3 June 1787, the fleet arrived at Santa Cruz at Tenerife. Fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-convicts-on-the-boats-coming-to-australia>What was life like for convicts on the boats coming to Australia?</h2>
<p>For the first 20 years, prisoners were chained up for the entire 8 months at sea. The cells were divided into compartments by wooden or iron bars. On some ships as many as 50 convicts were crammed into one compartment. Discipline was brutal, and the officers themselves were often illiterate, drunken and cruel.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-crimes-did-bushrangers-commit>What kind of crimes did bushrangers commit?</h2>
<p>over 400 men were arrested and convicted of armed robbery;7. at least 20 bushrangers were killed in shoot-outs or sentenced to death by courts;8. 11 NSW police officers were killed by bushrangers; many others were wounded in shootouts.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-convicts-do-to-become-a-convict>What did convicts do to become a convict?</h2>
<p>10 common crimes committed by convicts</p>
<ul>

<li>Burglary or housebreaking.</li>
<li>Highway robbery.</li>
<li>Stealing clothing.</li>
<li>Stealing animals.</li>
<li>Military offences.</li>
<li>Prostitution.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id=when-did-the-british-start-sending-convicts-to-australia>When did the British start sending convicts to Australia?</h2>
<p>For the modern Australian penal system, see Punishment in Australia. Between 1788 and 1868, about 162,000 convicts were transported from Britain and Ireland to various penal colonies in Australia. The British Government began transporting convicts overseas to American colonies in the early 18th century.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-convicts-go-after-they-got-their-freedom>Where did the convicts go after they got their freedom?</h2>
<p>Although convicts were transported to the colonies of New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia, many convicts ended up in other states or colonies, having been taken there by their assigned masters or by moving there after gaining their freedom. Distant settlements such as Moreton Bay and Norfolk Island were also used as places…</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-convicts-in-sydney-get-their-leave>How did the convicts in Sydney get their leave?</h2>
<p>During the early years of the settlement in Sydney, the government often gave convicts a ticket of leave if they were able to support themselves with work, or by growing food. Some convicts – such as those who had been wealthy gentlemen back in England – were given tickets of leave as soon as they arrived! However, this changed over time.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-descended-from-convicts-in-australia>How many people are descended from convicts in Australia?</h2>
<p>Around 20% of modern Australians, in addition to 2 million Britons, are descended from transported convicts. The convict era has inspired famous novels, films, and other cultural works, and the extent to which it has shaped Australia’s national character has been studied by many writers and historians. William Hogarth ‘s Gin Lane, 1751.</p>
