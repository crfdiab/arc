<h2 id=can-indians-and-pakistanis-get-married>Can Indians and Pakistanis get married?</h2>
<p>there is no clause in Indian law that forbids an Indian man (or woman) from marrying a Pakistani national. It is not illegal for Indian to Marry Pakistani according to Indian Law.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-wrong-with-indian-marriages>What is wrong with Indian marriages?</h2>
<p>Domestic violence, abuse and infidelity are not the only reasons why marriages break. Not every fight leaves a visible scar. There are many more things that can go wrong between a married couple that only the rest of the world can’t see. Sometimes, two people realize they’re just not compatible.</p>
<h2 id=which-age-is-best-for-marriage-for-girl-in-pakistan>Which age is best for marriage for girl in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>According to 31% of the girls (aged 12 to 17) in our study in Punjab, the appropriate age for marriage is 18 or 20 years. Yet, we observe a difference between the two districts: in Chakwal, 24% of the girls say that 18 years is an appropriate age for marriage; whereas in Vehari, this is 38% of the girls.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-girl-marry-a-younger-boy-in-hindu>Can a girl marry a younger boy in Hindu?</h2>
<p>There is no wrong or right here, just a natural evolution of an idea that brings two people together for life. So if one is in love with an older woman and wishes to marry her, there is nothing in Hindu Shastras that forbids that.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-hindu-marry-twice>Can a Hindu marry twice?</h2>
<p>A Hindu person cannot marry more than one person legally. He/she cannot keep more than one spouse at the same time. And the first spouse can file a case against the spouse committing polygamy under the Hindu Marriage Act. The Hindu Marriage Act is a codified law which prohibits a Hindu from practising polygamy.</p>
<h2 id=is-polygamy-legal-in-pakistan>Is polygamy legal in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Polygamy is legally permissible according to the law of 1961, but restricted, in the Muslim majority nation of Pakistan. Only males adhering to the Islamic faith are legally allowed to enter into polygamous unions, with a maximum of four wives at one time.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-any-indian-man-marry-pakistani-girl>Why did any Indian man marry Pakistani girl?</h2>
<p>The latest incident of yet another noble act is when the minister came out in support of cross-border marriage by helping an Indian groom get married to his Pakistani fiancée. No problem with that if Indian man marry pakistani girl . She will get Resident visa and later it will turn into citizenship ..</p>
<h2 id=can-a-punjabi-woman-marry-an-indian-man>Can a Punjabi woman marry an Indian man?</h2>
<p>The Pakistani Punjabi simply do not marry an Indian man (generally speaking and regardless if he is Muslim) and if they do, it is most likely of some celeb category. The national pride is too high and arrogant.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-indian-spy-who-married-a-pakistani-girl>Who was the Indian spy who married a Pakistani girl?</h2>
<p>That man was Ravindra Kaushik, one of India’s greatest spies. Born in Rajasthan in 1952, he was a Punjabi speaker – a language common in Pakistani Punjab. He was recruited as a spy by R&AW and given training in religion and Urdu language to pass off as an authentic Pakistani Muslim. He also underwent circumcision to that effect.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-pakistani-woman-a-good-wife>What makes a Pakistani woman a good wife?</h2>
<p>Pakistani women make the most considerate, caring, and loving wives ever. Whose ultimate goal in life is to keep their husband happy (No matter how irritating their actions become, they just won’t stop!) 3.</p>
