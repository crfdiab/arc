<p>Composite volcanoes are tall, symetrically shaped, with steep sides, sometimes rising 10,000 feet high. They are built of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, and cinders. Famous composite volcanoes include Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen in California, Mount St.</p>

<p>Some of the Earth’s grandest mountains are composite volcanoes–sometimes called stratovolcanoes. They are typically steep-sided, symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases.</p>

<p>Conical Composite or Stratovolcano These types of volcanoes are usually what make up the tallest mountains we see, rising to heights of over 8,000 feet (2,400 meters). They are tall and steep because of repeated lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks and bombs, which are larger debris erupted from these volcanoes.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-volcanoes-are-violent-with-steep-slopes>What kind of volcanoes are violent with steep slopes?</h2>
<p>They often form steep-sided mounds, some of which may be so steep that they appear as obelisks. Lassen Peak in California and Mont Pelee on the island of Martinique are types of lava dome volcanoes.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-smallest-type-of-volcano-in-the-world>Which is the smallest type of volcano in the world?</h2>
<p>Composite cones are tall, cone shaped volcanoes that produce explosive eruptions. Shield volcanoes form very large, gently sloped volcanoes with a wide base. Cinder cones are the smallest volcanic landform.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-description-of-a-shield-volcano>Which is the best description of a shield volcano?</h2>
<p>Shield volcanoes form very large, gently sloped volcanoes with a wide base. A volcano with a broad base, steep sides, and often a crater at the top. The volcano is composed of alternating layers of ash and lava flows. Also called a stratovolcano. strata</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-dangerous-volcano-in-the-world>Which is the most dangerous volcano in the world?</h2>
<p>Composite volcanoes are some of the most dangerous volcanoes on the planet. A composite volcano is formed over hundreds of thousands of years through multiple eruptions. The eruptions build up the composite volcano, layer upon layer until it towers thousands of meters tall.</p>
