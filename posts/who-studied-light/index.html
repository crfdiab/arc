<h2 id=who-studied-light>Who studied light?</h2>
<p>René Descartes. The most prominent advocate of a particle theory of light was Isaac Newton. Newton’s careful investigations into the properties of light in the 1660s led to his discovery that white light consists of a mixture of colours.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-researcher-of-light>Who is the researcher of light?</h2>
<p>Albert Einstein, 1879-1955 Einstein is famous for his research on the theory of relativity yet his work on theoretically revealing the photoelectric effect based on the light quantum hypothesis won him the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-scientist-who-studies-light-called>What is a scientist who studies light called?</h2>
<p>An optical scientist. Optics is a subcategory of physics and the field is huge. Lens design, optical engineering, photonics, lasers, illumination engineers, quantum optics, etc.</p>
<h2 id=who-first-studied-light>Who first studied light?</h2>
<p>Born around a thousand years ago in present day Iraq, Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (known in the West by the Latinised form of his first name, initially “Alhacen” and later “Alhazen”) was a pioneering scientific thinker who made important contributions to the understanding of vision, optics and light.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-light-can-humans-not-see>What type of light can humans not see?</h2>
<p>Wavelengths of light are measured in nanometers (nm). One nanometer is a billionth of a meter. Visible light has wavelengths ranging from about 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers. Wavelengths shorter than 400 nm, or longer than 700 nm, are invisible to the human eye.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-most-popular-scientist>Who is the most popular scientist?</h2>
<p>The 10 Greatest Scientists of All Time</p>
<ul>
<li>Albert Einstein: The Whole Package.</li>
<li>Marie Curie: She Went Her Own Way.</li>
<li>Isaac Newton: The Man Who Defined Science on a Bet.</li>
<li>Charles Darwin: Delivering the Evolutionary Gospel.</li>
<li>Nikola Tesla: Wizard of the Industrial Revolution.</li>
<li>Galileo Galilei: Discoverer of the Cosmos.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=who-first-discovered-light>Who first discovered light?</h2>
<p>In 1802, Humphry Davy invented the first electric light. He experimented with electricity and invented an electric battery. When he connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed, producing light.</p>
<h2 id=what-color-can-humans-not-see>What color can humans not see?</h2>
<p>Red-green and yellow-blue are the so-called “forbidden colors.” Composed of pairs of hues whose light frequencies automatically cancel each other out in the human eye, they’re supposed to be impossible to see simultaneously. The limitation results from the way we perceive color in the first place.</p>
<h2 id=what-the-human-eye-cannot-see>What the human eye Cannot see?</h2>
<p>The human eye can only see visible light, but light comes in many other “colors”—radio, infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma-ray—that are invisible to the naked eye. On one end of the spectrum there is infrared light, which, while too red for humans to see, is all around us and even emitted from our bodies.</p>
<h2 id=can-humans-bend-light>Can humans bend light?</h2>
<p>Any physics student knows that light travels in a straight line. But now researchers have shown that light can also travel in a curve, without any external influence. For light to bend by itself, however, is unheard of—almost.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-bend-light>Is it possible to bend light?</h2>
<p>Yes, light can bend around corners. In fact, light always bends around corners to some extent. This is a basic property of light and all other waves. The ability of light to bend around corners is also known as “diffraction”.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-explorers-of-light-program-begin>When did the explorers of light program begin?</h2>
<p>The Explorers of Light program began in 1995 to celebrate and highlight the work of outstanding professional imaging creators. For more than two decades the Explorers have been inspiring and educating photographers of all levels.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-scientist-to-discover-visible-light>Who was the first scientist to discover visible light?</h2>
<p>In the 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton explained this optical spectrum in his book Opticks. He was the first scientist to write about it but is not recognixed as the discoverer of visible light. He is believed to have discovered visible light by looking in a glass of water four centuries before Newton wrote about visible light.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-the-explorers-of-light>Where can I find the explorers of light?</h2>
<p>Examples of the Explorers’ work may be found online at the Explorers of Light Gallery, as well as numerous museums, galleries, and publications. Explorers of Light use the Canon EOS System and many print with Canon PIXMA PRO printers.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-artist-to-use-light>Who was the first artist to use light?</h2>
<p>Dan Flavin. ultimately became a pioneer of light art. He first conceived of incorporating lights into wall-mounted works in the early 1960s, and soon insisted upon commercial fluorescent tubing as a stand-alone medium—a radical challenge to traditional perceptions of the materials that are worthy of art.</p>
