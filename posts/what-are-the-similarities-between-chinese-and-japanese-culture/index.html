<h2 id=what-are-the-similarities-between-chinese-and-japanese-culture>What are the similarities between Chinese and Japanese culture?</h2>
<p>Religion. Both cultures are strongly influenced by Confucianism. There is a strong sense of loyalty that people of Japan as well as China have, though, the Chinese people tend to stay more loyal to their families. On the other hand, the Japanese are loyal to the group to which they belong.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-japan-and-china-during-the-heian-period>What was the relationship between Japan and China during the Heian Period?</h2>
<p>During the Heian Period (794-1185 CE), following a final embassy to the Tang court in 838 CE, there were no longer formal diplomatic relations with China as Japan became somewhat isolationist without any necessity to defend its borders or embark on territorial conquest.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-heian-japan-most-known-for>What is Heian Japan most known for?</h2>
<p>The Heian period is also considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court and noted for its art, especially poetry and literature. Two types of Japanese script emerged, including katakana, a phonetic script which was abbreviated into hiragana, a cursive alphabet with a unique writing method distinctive to Japan.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-similarities-between-chinese-and-japanese-literature>What is the similarities between Chinese and Japanese literature?</h2>
<p>The only major commonality between Japanese and Chinese is a common writing system, which the Japanese adopted in the 3rd Century. Previously, the language had no written form. The adoption of Kanji (Chinese characters, called Hanzi in their language of origin) carried with it the adoption of some Chinese loanwords.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-japanese-person-read-chinese>Can a Japanese person read Chinese?</h2>
<p>Syntactically, the order of words is different, but it is still true that Japanese can reasonably read a Chinese text, though won’t be able to pronounce it.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-music-of-the-tang-dynasty-influence-japan>How did the music of the Tang dynasty influence Japan?</h2>
<p>Influence of Tang-dynasty China The dominant musical style of early gagaku was, naturally, from China and was called Tang music (tōgaku). In Japan, as in Korea, the establishment and maintenance of such a music has made it possible for modern listeners to hear foreign versions of famous pieces long forgotten in the country of their origin.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-with-the-song-dynasty>What was the relationship with the Song dynasty?</h2>
<p>The Song court maintained diplomatic relations with Chola India, the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt, Srivijaya, the Kara-Khanid Khanate of Central Asia, the Goryeo kingdom in Korea, and other countries that were also trade partners with Japan.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-culture-of-japan-during-the-heian-period>What was the culture of Japan during the Heian period?</h2>
<p>Indigenous art also flourished under the Fujiwara after centuries of imitating Chinese forms. Vividly colored yamato-e, Japanese style paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines became common in the mid-to-late Heian period, setting patterns for Japanese art to this day. As culture flourished, so did decentralization.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-music-did-the-11th-century-japanese-listen-to>What kind of music did the 11th century Japanese listen to?</h2>
<p>The famous 11th-century works, such as Murasaki Shikibu ’s Genji monogatari ( The Tale of Genji ), are filled with romantic koto, biwa, and flutes, as well as gagaku and bugaku performances and the singing of many songs.</p>
