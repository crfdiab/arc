<h2 id=what-role-did-lewis-and-clark-play-in-the-expansion-of-the-united-states>What role did Lewis and Clark play in the expansion of the United States?</h2>
<p>Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–06) was a U.S. military expedition, led by Captain Meriwether Lewis and Lieutenant William Clark, to explore the Louisiana Purchase and the Pacific Northwest. The expedition was a major chapter in the history of American exploration.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-president-thomas-jefferson-buy-that-led-to-the-lewis-and-clark-expedition>What did President Thomas Jefferson buy that led to the Lewis and Clark Expedition?</h2>
<p>In 1803, under the threat of war, President Jefferson and James Monroe successfully negotiated a deal with France to purchase the Louisiana Territory—which included about 827,000 square miles—for $15 million.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-lewis-and-clark-expedition-influence-the-westward-expansion>How did the Lewis and Clark Expedition influence the westward expansion?</h2>
<p>The Lewis and Clark Expedition had a very significant influence on the westward expansion of the United States.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-westward-expansion>Who was the leader of the westward expansion?</h2>
<p>The real leaders of this movement that lasted for over half a century were Lewis Meriwether and Clark William. Due to American’s settling in the west, many future events that also impated history were able to be made. The gold rush would not have been possible if pioneers like Lewis and Clark hadn’t begun the journey that lead America forward.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-lewis-and-clark-bring-back-with-them>What did Lewis and Clark bring back with them?</h2>
<p>Unauthorized use is prohibited. Lewis and Clark’s team mapped uncharted land, rivers, and mountains. They brought back journals filled with details about Native American tribes and scientific notes about plants and animals they’d never seen before. They also brought back stories—tales that made other Americans dream about heading west.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-lewis-and-clark-set-up-camp>Where did Lewis and Clark set up camp?</h2>
<p>A group of men climbed out and began to set up camp under a dark canopy of oak trees. Suddenly a violent storm moved in, pelting the area with snow and hail. A painting shows explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark navigating the Missouri River on their journey to the West Coast of the United States.</p>
