<h2 id=how-long-is-the-walk-across-the-williamsburg-bridge>How long is the walk across the Williamsburg Bridge?</h2>
<p>The walk across the Williamsburg Bridge is shortly over a mile long and it can range from 30 minutes to an hour depending on how much you stop to take pictures along your Williamsburg Bridge walk. Just like the other bridges, it has views of the Manhattan skyline and East River.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-brooklyn-bridge-pedestrian-walkway>How long is the Brooklyn Bridge pedestrian walkway?</h2>
<p>1.1 miles<br>
A: The Brooklyn Bridge is 5,989 ft. long (or 1825 meters) from one end to the other, but the river span is 1,595 feet (486 meters). The pedestrian walkway across the bridge is slightly over 1.1 miles, or 1.6 kilometers long.</p>

<h2 id=where-is-the-entrance-to-the-brooklyn-bridge-walkway>Where is the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge walkway?</h2>
<p>The Brooklyn Bridge Pedestrian Walkway begins at the intersection of Tillary Street and Boerum Place and is the entrance one sees from a car when crossing the Brooklyn Bridge. The second way to get onto the walkway is to access it via the underpass on Washington Street, about two blocks from Front Street in Brooklyn.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-walk-the-williamsburg-bridge-at-night>Is it safe to walk the Williamsburg Bridge at night?</h2>
<p>NYC is extremely safe. If the weather is nice and the night is clear the bridge will be packed with locals and tourists. Many people walk the bridge at all hours.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-worth-walking-over-brooklyn-bridge>Is it worth walking over Brooklyn Bridge?</h2>
<p>Like many popular New York activities, crossing the Brooklyn Bridge on foot can be alternately exciting (the jaw-dropping views) and aggravating (the crowds). It’s totally worth making the Brooklyn Bridge walk though, especially if you’re prepared and know what you’re getting into.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-walk-the-williamsburg-bridge-at-night-1>Is it safe to walk the Williamsburg bridge at night?</h2>
<h2 id=can-trucks-go-over-williamsburg-bridge>Can trucks go over Williamsburg Bridge?</h2>
<p>The Williamsburg Bridge has eight traffic lanes, two transit racks and a pedestrian foot walk between Manhattan and Brooklyn. No trucks are allowed on the inner roadways due to weight restrictions.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-hard-to-bike-over-the-williamsburg-bridge>Is it hard to bike over the Williamsburg Bridge?</h2>
<p>(7,089 daily rides, 1.38 miles, 1.85% avg. For some reason, the Williamsburg Bridge feels a lot tougher to ride than the numbers seem to indicate. Since I live in South Brooklyn, I asked friends who more regularly ride across the Williamsburg Bridge to describe the commute experience to me.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-run-over-the-williamsburg-bridge>Can you run over the Williamsburg Bridge?</h2>
<p>For city dwellers, running over a bridge can offer a nice variation on the classic hill run. If you are in the NYC area, I recommend running the Williamsburg Bridge as it’s generally less prone to foot traffic from tourists as compared to the Manhattan or Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-it-takes-to-walk-the-brooklyn-bridge>How long it takes to walk the Brooklyn Bridge?</h2>
<p>60 minutes<br>
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO WALK OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE? The short answer is 60 minutes. That’s the time that most visitors to the bridge take to cross. New York commuters hurrying to work spend 25 minutes crossing the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-best-way-to-walk-across-the-williamsburg-bridge>Where is the best way to walk across the Williamsburg Bridge?</h2>
<p>On the Brooklyn side, stroll towards the water on S 6th street past cafes and shops, or head north on Bedford to hit the heart of Williamsburg. On the Manhattan side, walk north on Clinton Street, through the Lower East Side and up through the East Village. This is quite a nice walk on a pretty day.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-williamsburg-bridge-toll-free-in-nyc>Is the Williamsburg Bridge toll free in NYC?</h2>
<p>The Williamsburg Bridge, just like the Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge, connects Brooklyn to Manhattan over the East River, which makes for an easy route when traveling between the boroughs. One thing New Yorkers love about this bridge, is that it is toll-free!</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-williamsburg-bridge-in-brooklyn>How tall is the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn?</h2>
<p>Williamsburg Bridge spans around 1600 feet, hovers over the East River, and connects South Williamsburg in Brooklyn with the Lower East Side in Manhattan. In addition to the walk across the Williamsburg Bridge, the bridge offers lanes for bicyclists, multiple lanes for cars, and subway tracks for the J, M, and Z trains.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-bike-lanes-on-the-williamsburg-bridge>Where are the bike lanes on the Williamsburg Bridge?</h2>
<p>Obey Pedestrian and Bike Lanes on the Bridge. On the Williamsburg Bridge, pedestrians have their own walkway. In Brooklyn, enter at Berry Street between South 5th and South 6th Streets. Cyclists enter a few blocks east, at Washington Plaza (Roebling and South 4th Streets).</p>
