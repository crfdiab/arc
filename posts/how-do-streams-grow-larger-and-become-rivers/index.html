<h2 id=how-do-streams-grow-larger-and-become-rivers>How do streams grow larger and become rivers?</h2>
<p>When one stream meets another and they merge together, the smaller stream is known as a tributary. The two streams meet at a confluence. It takes many tributary streams to form a river. A river grows larger as it collects water from more tributaries.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-a-stream-flowing-into-a-large-river>What do you call a stream flowing into a large river?</h2>
<p>A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A confluence, where two or more bodies of water meet together, usually refers to the joining of tributaries.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-river-a-large-stream>Is a river a large stream?</h2>
<p>A river is a large stream of water flowing through the land, usually fed by smaller streams.</p>
<h2 id=how-wide-is-a-stream>How wide is a stream?</h2>
<p>What is a Stream? A stream is slightly larger than a branch and can still often be called a creek by folks. Technically, if it is less than 60 feet wide, it can be called a stream.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-large-natural-stream-of-water-called>What is a large natural stream of water called?</h2>
<p>A river is a large, natural stream of flowing water. Rivers are found on every continent and on nearly every kind of land.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-creek-or-a-stream-bigger>Is a creek or a stream bigger?</h2>
<p>Streams vary in size from streamlets to brooks, creeks, and rivers. However, a stream is generally considered to be smaller than a river. A creek is a small body of flowing water. Since stream refers to any flowing body of water, a creek is a type of stream.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-larger-a-river-or-a-stream>Which is larger a river or a stream?</h2>
<p>The point where a stream or river empties into a lake, a larger river, or an ocean, is its mouth. When one stream or river flows into another, usually larger, stream or river, and adds its flow, it is considered a tributary of the larger river. Many tributaries make up a river system.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-streams-formed-and-how-are-rivers-formed>How are streams formed and how are rivers formed?</h2>
<p>Small streams meet and join together, growing larger and larger until the flow can be called a river. On its way down, the water shapes the landscape by wearing away rock and carving out a network of valleys.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-river-form-on-its-way-down>How does a river form on its way down?</h2>
<p>Small streams meet and join together, growing larger and larger until the flow can be called a river. On its way down, the water shapes the landscape by wearing away rock and carving out a network of valleys. Reaching lower ground, the river widens and takes a winding route.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-streams-and-rivers-driven-by-gravity>How are streams and rivers driven by gravity?</h2>
<p>A stream is flow of water, driven by gravity, in a natural channel, on land. A small brook in a meadow and the Amazon River are both streams. It is interesting to watch water on a recently bulldozed construction site with a slope. At first the water saturates the ground and begins to flow downhill across the surface of the slope in a thin sheet.</p>
