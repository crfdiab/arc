<h2 id=when-did-mount-mckinley-become-known-as-mount-mckinley>When did Mount McKinley become known as Mount McKinley?</h2>
<p>As Mount McKinley became more established in American vernacular in the early 1900s, there were still many people with connections to Interior Alaska who were disturbed by the dismissal of Native antecedents. Browne and Sheldon were not the only proponents of “Denali.”</p>
<h2 id=when-did-mount-mckinley-change-its-name-to-denali>When did Mount McKinley change its name to Denali?</h2>
<p>The state of Alaska officially changed the name to Denali in 1975 and asked the federal government to do so too. However, when the park was tripled in size and renamed Denali National Park and Preserve in 1980, the federal government retained the name Mount McKinley, according to the Alaska Dispatch News.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-mount-mckinley-get-its-name-churchill-peaks>How did Mount McKinley get its name Churchill Peaks?</h2>
<p>The United States formally recognized the name Mount McKinley after President Wilson signed the Mount McKinley National Park Act of February 26, 1917. In 1965, Lyndon B. Johnson declared the north and south peaks of the mountain the “Churchill Peaks”, in honor of British statesman Winston Churchill.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-mount-mckinley-or-denali-national-park>Which is better Mount McKinley or Denali National Park?</h2>
<p>Despite the official decision to use “Mount McKinley” as the name of the peak and the national park, the debate did not die. It proved difficult to supplant words and meanings that endured for generations among Athabaskan groups living in close proximity to the mountain.</p>

<h2 id=where-is-mount-mckinley-in-los-angeles-california>Where is Mount McKinley in Los Angeles California?</h2>
<p>Mount McKinley is close to Yerba Buena Spring. Ad. Indian Springs is an unincorporated community in Los Angeles County, California, United States. Sunland-Tujunga is a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of the city of Los Angeles located by the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in the Crescenta Valley.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-like-the-name-denali-or-mount-mckinley>Do you like the name Denali or Mount McKinley?</h2>
<p>“I don’t like the name of Denali. It is not descriptive. Everybody in the United States knows of Mt. McKinley and the various efforts made to climb it. In consequence, both Mr. Yard and I think that the name McKinley should stick.”</p>
