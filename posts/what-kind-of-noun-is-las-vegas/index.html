<h2 id=what-kind-of-noun-is-las-vegas>What kind of noun is Las Vegas?</h2>
<p>proper noun<br>
Las Vegas (proper noun)</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-possessive-of-las-vegas>What is the possessive of Las Vegas?</h2>
<p>To create a possessive proper noun that ends in an s, just add an ‘ (apostrophe). We’re going to Lucas’ game tomorrow. Las Vegas’ airport is really busy tonight.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-concrete-and-abstract>What is the difference between concrete and abstract?</h2>
<p>Abstract words refer to intangible qualities, ideas, and concepts. These words indicate things we know only through our intellect, like “truth,” “honor,” “kindness,” and “grace.” Concrete words refer to tangible, qualities or characteristics, things we know through our senses.</p>
<h2 id=is-work-an-abstract-or-concrete-noun>Is work an abstract or concrete noun?</h2>
<p>We would agree that “laughter” is a concrete noun, but what about “love,” “work,” and “result”? It is fairly easy to make cases for these being concrete nouns, but they are classified as abstract nouns. Be aware that the distinction between abstract noun and concrete noun is sometimes blurry.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-spanish-word-vegas-mean>What does the Spanish word Vegas mean?</h2>
<p>The Meadows<br>
It was first called Las Vegas (which means The Meadows in the Spanish language) by the Spanish. The city is known for its dry weather, as is the rest of southern Nevada.</p>
<h2 id=what-las-means>What Las means?</h2>
<p>Life Administration Services (various locations) LAS. Las Vegas, NV, USA – McCarran International Airport (Airport Code) LAS. Local Area System.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-singular-possessive>What is singular possessive?</h2>
<p>Singular Possessive noun: A singular possessive noun indicates something belongs to someone or something— ownership. To indicate ownership we add an ‘s . For example: • cat’s tail.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-write-last-names-ending-in-s>How do you write last names ending in s?</h2>
<p>Names are pluralized like regular words. Add -es for names ending in “s” or “z” and add -s for everything else. When indicating the possessive, if there is more than one owner add an apostrophe to the plural; if there is one owner, add ‘s to the singular (The Smiths’ car vs.</p>
<h2 id=are-you-an-abstract-thinker>Are you an abstract thinker?</h2>
<p>They want to know the exact steps and often have little patience with changing plans or new ideas. They don’t like it when they have to try to read between the lines, or when instructions are ambiguous. Abstract thinkers can’t help but think about how everything relates to the bigger picture.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-considered-an-abstract-idea>What is considered an abstract idea?</h2>
<p>an idea separated from a complex object, or from other ideas which naturally accompany it; as the solidity of marble when contemplated apart from its color or figure. …</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-an-abstract-and-a-concrete-noun>What’s the difference between an abstract and a concrete noun?</h2>
<p>In essence, an abstract noun is a quality, a concept, an idea, or maybe even an event. Abstract nouns and concrete nouns are usually defined in terms of one another. Something that is abstract exists only in the mind, while something that is concrete can be interacted with in a physical way.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-abstract-and-concrete-reasoning>What’s the difference between abstract and concrete reasoning?</h2>
<p>People who use concrete reasoning make their decisions based solely on the tangible, visible details that they see around them. Thinking concretely is a more primitive way of thinking as this type of thinking doesn’t consider other possible alternatives that are less visible, such as certain scientific principles, feelings, or philosophies.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-abstract-thinkers-and-concrete-thinkers>What’s the difference between abstract thinkers and concrete thinkers?</h2>
<p>Abstract thinkers use analogies and metaphors to understand the world. They can read body language and know the difference between verbal and nonverbal. They can see the space difference in an object and see what it looks like behind it without having to rotate. They’re critical thinkers, science-minded, and can reason quite well.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-concrete-and-uncountable-nouns>What’s the difference between concrete and uncountable nouns?</h2>
<p>Uncountable nouns, on the other hand, are nouns that cannot be considered as separate units. They are also known as non-count or mass nouns. Concrete nouns that are uncountable tend to be substances or collective categories of things. For instance:</p>
