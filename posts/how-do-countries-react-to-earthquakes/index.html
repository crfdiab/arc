<h2 id=how-do-countries-react-to-earthquakes>How do countries react to earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Responses are how countries react to an earthquake. They are categorised as follows: Short-term or immediate – a response in the days and weeks immediately after a disaster has happened. Short-term responses mainly involve search and rescue and helping the injured.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-responses-after-an-earthquake>What are the responses after an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Short-term responses mainly involve search and rescue and helping the injured with medical aid, then providing emergency shelter, food and water. Long-term – responses that go on for months and years after a disaster.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-government-do-after-an-earthquake>What does the government do after an earthquake?</h2>
<p>When the president declares an area struck by an earthquake to be a major disaster area, FEMA swings into action. A coordinating officer is appointed, who sets up a disaster field office to manage the response and recovery, including rescue and small loans and grants to businesses or individuals.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-we-do-after-earthquake-earthquake>What should we do after earthquake earthquake?</h2>
<p>After an earthquake you should: Walk inland or to higher ground as soon as it is safe to do so. Do not wait for official notification. Stay away from the coast until officials permit you to return. Check for injuries. Do not move seriously-injured persons unless they are in immediate danger.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-earthquakes-worse-in-developing-countries>Why are earthquakes worse in developing countries?</h2>
<p>Why do earthquakes in other countries seem to cause more damage and casualties than earthquakes in the U.S.? There is more damage and more deaths from earthquakes in other parts of the world primarily because of buildings which are poorly designed and constructed for earthquake regions, and population density.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-there-is-an-earthquake-in-a-country>What happens when there is an earthquake in a country?</h2>
<p>Should an earthquake strike, countries without the funding in place have to add the complicated and time-consuming process of raising more money to the already daunting mix of recovery, rescue and emergency efforts.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-aon-helping-countries-recover-from-devastating-earthquakes>How is AON helping countries recover from devastating earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Aon and the World Bank believe the collaborative effort has other applications to help countries all over the world in their de-risking efforts. Famine, drought, and other natural disasters are all possibilities for this kind of catastrophe bond structure.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-recover-after-a-deadly-earthquake>How do you recover after a deadly earthquake?</h2>
<p>“Such models produced in the days and weeks following a disaster are a key information tool to support early decision-making for relief and recovery,” says Lallemant. “Strong earthquakes affect very large areas and it takes a long time before we get a clear picture of the extent of the damages, fatalities and so forth.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-country-receive-an-emergency-payout-after-an-earthquake>Can a country receive an emergency payout after an earthquake?</h2>
<p>For a country to receive an emergency payout, a set of pre-determined parameters would have to be met. With natural disasters, speed is of the essence. Faster access to funds means earlier action, which means the impact on people and infrastructure is reduced.</p>
