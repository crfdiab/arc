<h2 id=what-immigrants-built-the-panama-canal>What immigrants built the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>Spaniards and Italians led the pack of European immigrants who worked on building the Panama Canal 100 years ago. Today, Spain and Italy are again at the forefront in the current expansion work being undertaken at the canal.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-theodore-roosevelt-want-the-panama-canal-built>Why did Theodore Roosevelt want the Panama Canal built?</h2>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt wanted a canal through the Isthmus of Panama because such a route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean would cut eight thousand miles off the voyage from New York to San Francisco. This plan succeeded and the canal opened in 1914.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-us-want-to-build-the-panama-canal>Why did the US want to build the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>The second reason the Panama Canal was built was to allow military ships of the United States to have a shorter route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. President Theodore Roosevelt decided to fund the building of the Panama Canal after Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines became United States Territories.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-principal-engineer-of-the-panama-canal>Who was the principal engineer of the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>Panama Canal Canal de Panamá Principal engineer John Findley Wallace (1904–1905), John F Construction began 4 May 1904; 117 years ago Date completed 15 August 1914; 107 years ago Date extended 26 June 2016; 5 years ago</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-us-president-when-the-panama-canal-was-signed>Who was the US President when the Panama Canal was signed?</h2>
<p>On September 7, 1977, the treaty was signed by President of the United States Jimmy Carter and Omar Torrijos, de facto leader of Panama. This mobilized the process of granting the Panamanians free control of the canal so long as Panama signed a treaty guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of the canal.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-when-trans-isthmian-canal-was-built>Who was president when trans isthmian canal was built?</h2>
<p>President Theodore Roosevelt oversaw the realization of a long-term United States goal—a trans-isthmian canal. Throughout the 1800s, American and British leaders and businessmen wanted to ship goods quickly and cheaply between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.</p>
