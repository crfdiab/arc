<h2 id=what-is-the-clatsop-tribe-known-for>What is the Clatsop tribe known for?</h2>

<h2 id=what-indians-were-related-to-the-clatsop-indians>What Indians were related to the Clatsop Indians?</h2>
<p>On a cultural basis, the Chinooks, Clatsops, Wahkiakum, and Kathlamets were ethnically similar. Through common usage the designation Chinook has been applied to all four groups. First exposed to white traders, the Chinooks proper dominated commerce at the mouth of the Columbia River and prospered.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-chinook-tribe-live>Where did the Chinook tribe live?</h2>

<h2 id=is-the-tillamook-tribe-still-alive>Is the Tillamook tribe still alive?</h2>

<h2 id=what-language-did-the-clatsop-tribe-speak>What language did the Clatsop tribe speak?</h2>
<p>Lower Chinookan language<br>
Clatsop in the original language is łät’cαp, which means “place of dried salmon”. Clatsop was originally the name of a single settlement, later applied to the tribe as a whole. The Clatsop dialect used by the tribe is an extinct dialect of the Lower Chinookan language.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-fun-fact-about-the-chinook-tribe>What is a fun fact about the Chinook tribe?</h2>
<p>The Chinook Indians were fishing people. Their staple food was salmon. Chinook men also caught many other kinds of fish and sea mammals from their canoes and hunted deer, birds, and small game on land. Chinook women gathered clams and shellfish, seaweed, berries, and roots.</p>
<h2 id=is-tillamook-an-indian-name>Is Tillamook an Indian name?</h2>
<p>In its early years, the town of Tillamook, the first community to be settled in the county, bore the unofficial names Lincoln and Hoquarton, the latter believed to be an Indian name meaning “the landing.” Its name was eventually changed to Tillamook, an Indian word meaning “the many peoples of the Nehelim.” William …</p>
<h2 id=where-is-tillamook-made>Where is Tillamook made?</h2>
<p>Oregon<br>
The vast majority (more than 90 percent) of Tillamook Cheeses are made at our cheesemaking factories in Tillamook and Boardman, Oregon. A few of our other cheeses are made by industry partners outside of Oregon who have the appropriate equipment and expertise for those specific flavors.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-clatsop-tribe>What happened to the Clatsop tribe?</h2>
<p>The Clatsop have no formal recognition today and have struggled in recent years to retain their communal identity. In May 2020, the North Coast Land Conservancy transferred 18.6 acres (7.5 ha) of its Neawanna Point Habitat Preserve, located on the north Oregon coast, to the Clatsop-Nehalem Confederated Tribes.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-clatsop-people-live-in-oregon>Where did the Clatsop people live in Oregon?</h2>
<p>In the early 19th century they inhabited an area of the northwestern coast of present-day Oregon from the mouth of the Columbia River south to Tillamook Head, Oregon. Clatsop in the original language is łät’cαp, which means “place of dried salmon “.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-members-of-the-clatsop-nehalem-tribe>Who are the members of the Clatsop-Nehalem tribe?</h2>
<p>The Clatsop-Nehalem have approximately 130 members and claim to have Chinookan and Salish-speaking Tillamook (Nehalem) ancestry. This is contested by the Chinook Indian Nation. The Indian Claims Commission, Docket 234, found, in 1957, that the Clatsop Chinooks were part of the Chinook Indian Nation.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-language-did-the-clatsop-indians-speak>What kind of language did the Clatsop Indians speak?</h2>
<p>The Clatsop dialect used by the tribe is an extinct dialect of the Lower Chinookan language. Most Clatsops spoke Chinook Jargon by the time Lewis and Clark ‘s Corps of Discovery made contact with them. Some spoke Nehalem, reflecting intermarriage and cohabitation with that tribe.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-lewis-and-clark-find-the-clatsop-tribe>Where did Lewis and Clark find the Clatsop tribe?</h2>
<p>The tribe is first reported in the 1792 journals of Robert Gray and was later encountered at the mouth of Columbia in 1805 by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The expedition named their last encampment Fort Clatsop after the tribe, whose nearest major village was approximately 7 miles (11 km) away.</p>
