<h2 id=when-did-france-get-occupied>When did France get occupied?</h2>
<p>On November 10, 1942, German troops occupy Vichy France, which had previously been free of an Axis military presence. Since July 1940, upon being invaded and defeated by Nazi German forces, the autonomous French state had been split into two regions.</p>

<p>May 10, 1940 – June 25, 1940<br>
Battle of France/Periods</p>
<h2 id=why-did-germany-defeat-france-so-quickly>Why did Germany defeat France so quickly?</h2>
<p>France suffered a humiliating defeat and was quickly occupied by Germany. Its failure was a result of a hopelessly divided French political elite, a lack of quality military leadership, rudimentary French military tactics.</p>
<h2 id=was-france-the-most-powerful-army-in-ww2>Was France the most powerful army in ww2?</h2>
<p>Lormier is one of a number of historians who are reinterpreting the events of May-June 1940, using French and German military archives. Five million men were mobilised in France at the start of World War Two. The army was reputed to be one of the strongest in the world, certainly every bit a match for the Germans.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-occupation-of-france-in-world-war-2>What was the occupation of France in World War 2?</h2>
<p>The Military Administration in France (German: Militärverwaltung in Frankreich; French: Occupation de la France par l’Allemagne) was an interim occupation authority established by Nazi Germany during World War II to administer the occupied zone in areas of northern and western France.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-germany-take-over-north-east-france>When did Germany take over North East France?</h2>
<p>The German occupation of north-east France refers to the period in which French territory, mostly along the Belgian and Luxembourgish border, was held under military occupation by the German Empire during World War I.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-capital-of-france-during-world-war-2>Where was the capital of France during World War 2?</h2>
<p>The armistice divided France into occupied and unoccupied zones: northern and western France, including the entire Atlantic coast, was occupied by Germany, and the remaining two-fifths of the country was under the control of the French government with the capital at Vichy under Pétain.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-north-east-france-occupied-during-world-war-1>Why was north-east France occupied during World War 1?</h2>
<p>Partly because of its proximity to the front, occupied north-east France was ruled by the military, rather than by a civilian occupation administration. Economic exploitation of the occupied zone increased throughout the war. Forced labor became increasingly common as the war dragged on.</p>
