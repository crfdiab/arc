<h2 id=is-texas-environmentally-friendly>Is Texas environmentally friendly?</h2>
<p>3 in eco-friendly behaviors, and No. 25 climate-change contributions. While not so green right now, Texas has made great strides in wind energy in recent years. The American Wind Energy Association’s annual report for 2018 shows the Lone Star State is home to roughly one-fourth of all U.S. wind power production.</p>
<h2 id=how-will-texas-be-affected-by-climate-change>How will Texas be affected by climate change?</h2>
<p>The Texas impacts of global warming will vary by region. Because of Texas’ size, terrain, location and diversity, the list of those impacts is startling: more heat waves, worse air quality, increased risk of disease, droughts, wildfires and coastal erosion.</p>
<h2 id=is-texas-polluted>Is Texas polluted?</h2>
<p>Report: Unauthorized Air Pollution In Texas Has More Than Doubled Since 2015. In Texas, the amount of excess emissions has more than doubled since 2015 when facilities across the state reported emitting 68 million pounds of unauthorized pollutants, according to the report.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-texas-storm-due-to-climate-change>Is the Texas storm due to climate change?</h2>
<p>According to research about Arctic amplification, increasing temperatures due to climate change can lead to atmospheric patterns that result in easier winter storm development. The path of these storms is also changing, which is why Texas may have had its devastating snowfall.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-environmental-problems-in-texas>Why are there so many environmental problems in Texas?</h2>
<p>As with any other region in the U.S., Texas has its share of environmental concerns that travelers should be aware of before visiting. Three of the biggest environmental problems that plague Texas are poor air and water quality as a result of pollution from oil refineries and chemical plants, as well as the effects of oil spills.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-future-of-texas-depend-on-climate>How does the future of Texas depend on climate?</h2>
<p>The study of historic and future climate trends says the state has already experienced such changes in recent decades and that “the future of Texas depends on its resilience to the natural hazards of the future.”</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-texas-commission-on-environmental-quality>Where is the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality?</h2>
<p>Headquarters complex for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is the environmental agency for the state of Texas. The commission’s headquarters are located at 12100 Park 35 Circle in Austin.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-an-energy-system-in-texas>Why do we need an energy system in Texas?</h2>
<p>Texas needs an energy system that can stand up to any weather — especially for our schools, fire stations and police stations. A Texas bill would have punished wind and solar for the blackout they didn’t cause. We helped fix it.</p>
