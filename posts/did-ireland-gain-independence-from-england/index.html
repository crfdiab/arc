<h2 id=did-ireland-gain-independence-from-england>Did Ireland gain independence from England?</h2>
<p>In 1922, after the Irish War of Independence most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom to become the independent Irish Free State but under the Anglo-Irish Treaty the six northeastern counties, known as Northern Ireland, remained within the United Kingdom, creating the partition of Ireland.</p>

<p>History of Ireland (1169–1536), when England invaded Ireland. History of Ireland (1536–1691), when England conquered Ireland. History of Ireland (1691–1801), the time of the Protestant Ascendency. History of Ireland (1801–1923), when Ireland was merged with the United Kingdom.</p>

<h2 id=is-ireland-under-british-control>Is Ireland under British control?</h2>
<p>Ireland became a republic in 1949 and Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-ireland-called-eire>Why is Ireland called Eire?</h2>
<p>Etymology. The modern Irish Éire evolved from the Old Irish word Ériu, which was the name of a Gaelic goddess. Ériu is generally believed to have been the matron goddess of Ireland, a goddess of sovereignty, or simply a goddess of the land.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-ireland-get-its-independence>When did Ireland get its independence?</h2>
<p>Ireland gained independence from Britain in 1922, following a guerrilla war waged by the IRA against the police and the British forces. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom, and the new southern state became independent after more than seven centuries of British rule.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-republic-of-ireland-part-of-the-united-kingdom>Is the Republic of Ireland part of the United Kingdom?</h2>
<p>Today, the British Isles contain two sovereign states: Ireland (alternatively described as the Republic of Ireland) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom comprises four countries of the United Kingdom. All but Northern Ireland have been independent states at one point.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-great-britain-and-ireland-join-together>When did Great Britain and Ireland join together?</h2>
<p>Therefore the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland were merged in 1801 to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . On 1 January 1801, the first day of the 19th century, the Great Britain and Ireland joined to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-irish-war-of-independence>What was the result of the Irish War of Independence?</h2>
<p>The Irish War of Independence led to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, between the British government and representatives of the Irish Republic. It was signed on 6 December 1921. Under its terms, the territory of Southern Ireland would leave the United Kingdom within one year and become a self-governing dominion called the Irish Free State.</p>
