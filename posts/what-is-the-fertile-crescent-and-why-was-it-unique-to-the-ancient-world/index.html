<h2 id=what-is-the-fertile-crescent-and-why-was-it-unique-to-the-ancient-world>What is the Fertile Crescent and why was it unique to the ancient world?</h2>
<p>The Fertile Crescent is the boomerang-shaped region of the Middle East that was home to some of the earliest human civilizations. Also known as the “Cradle of Civilization,” this area was the birthplace of a number of technological innovations, including writing, the wheel, agriculture, and the use of irrigation.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-fertile-crescent>When was the Fertile Crescent?</h2>
<p>Fertile Crescent, the region where the first settled agricultural communities of the Middle East and Mediterranean basin are thought to have originated by the early 9th millennium bce. The term was popularized by the American Orientalist James Henry Breasted.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-fertile-crescent-in-southwest-asia>Is the Fertile Crescent in southwest Asia?</h2>
<p>The Fertile Crescent is a crescent-shaped region in the Middle East, spanning modern-day Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, together with the southeastern region of Turkey and the western fringes of Iran. Some authors also include Cyprus.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-first-civilization>Who were the first civilization?</h2>
<p>Mesopotamian Civilization<br>
The Mesopotamian Civilization. And here it is, the first civilization to have ever emerged. The origin of Mesopotamia dates back so far that there is no known evidence of any other civilized society before them. The timeline of ancient Mesopotamia is usually held to be from around 3300 BC to 750 BC.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-religion-bring-unification-among-early-societies>How did religion bring unification among early societies?</h2>
<p>Early civilizations were often unified by religion—a system of beliefs and behaviors that deal with the meaning of existence. As more and more people shared the same set of beliefs and practices, people who did not know each other could find common ground and build mutual trust and respect.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-fertile-crescent-called-the-cradle-of-civilization>Why was the Fertile Crescent called the cradle of civilization?</h2>
<p>Vocabulary Named for its rich soils, the Fertile Crescent, often called the “cradle of civilization,” is found in the Middle East. Because of this region’s relatively abundant access to water, the earliest civilizations were established in the Fertile Crescent, including the Sumerians.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-fertile-crescent-in-the-world>Where is the Fertile Crescent in the world?</h2>
<p>Its area covers what are now southern Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Egypt, and parts of Turkey and Iran. Two rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, regularly flooded the region, and the Nile River also runs through part of it. Irrigation and agriculture developed here because of the fertile soil found near these rivers.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-fertile-crescent-important-to-egypt>Why was the Fertile Crescent important to Egypt?</h2>
<p>Two rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, regularly flooded the region, and the Nile River also runs through part of it. Irrigation and agriculture developed here because of the fertile soil found near these rivers. Access to water helped with farming and trade routes. Soon, its natural riches brought travelers in and out of the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-people-start-farming-in-the-fertile-crescent>When did people start farming in the Fertile Crescent?</h2>
<p>The first human beings to farm and domesticate animals lived in the fertile crescent around 10,000 BCE. A thousand years later, farming was prevalent; by 5,000 BCE farmers in the fertile crescent had developed irrigation systems and raising sheep for wool.</p>
