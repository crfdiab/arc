<h2 id=what-is-northern-ireland-called>What is Northern Ireland called?</h2>
<p>Northern Ireland is literally translated to Tuaisceart Éireann in Irish (though it is sometimes known as Na Sé Chontae ‘The Six Counties’ as well as Tuaisceart na hÉireann ‘[the] North of Ireland’ by republicans) and Norlin Airlann or Northern Ireland in Ulster Scots.</p>
<h2 id=is-northern-ireland-called-ulster>Is Northern Ireland called Ulster?</h2>
<p>Northern Ireland is often referred to as Ulster, despite including only six of Ulster’s nine counties. This usage is most common among people in Northern Ireland who are unionist, although it is also used by the media throughout the United Kingdom. Most Irish nationalists object to the use of Ulster in this context.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-republic-of-ireland-part-of-northern-ireland>Is the Republic of Ireland part of Northern Ireland?</h2>
<p>Northern Ireland (Irish: Tuaisceart Éireann [ˈt̪ˠuəʃcəɾˠt̪ˠ ˈeːɾʲən̪ˠ] (); Ulster-Scots: Norlin Airlann) is variously described as a country, province, or region, which is part of the United Kingdom. Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-provinces-are-there-in-the-republic-of-ireland>How many provinces are there in the Republic of Ireland?</h2>
<p>The province Ulster (in Irish “ Cúige Uladh “, in Ulster-Scots “ Ulstèr “, literally “the Fifth of the Uladh”) consists of nine counties – six of which form Northern Ireland, three being part of the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-counties-are-there-in-northern-ireland>How many counties are there in Northern Ireland?</h2>
<p>Ulster is a province with 9 counties. When Ireland became independent from Britain, and Northern Ireland was added to create the UK, it comprised 6 of the Ulster counties. The other three counties are part of Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-smallest-province-of-ireland-by-area>Which is the smallest province of Ireland by area?</h2>
<p>Connacht (in older documents also called “Connaught”, in Irish Cúige Chonnacht) consists of counties Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, and Sligo. It is the smallest province of Ireland if you go by the number of counties included.</p>
