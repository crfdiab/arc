<p>President James Polk<br>
People had made false claims before that they had discovered gold, so it wasn’t until December of 1848, when President James Polk backed up the discovery, that the Gold Rush began.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-president-do-that-accelerated-the-gold-rush>What did the president do that accelerated the gold rush?</h2>
<p>In early December 1848, President James K. Polk confirmed that quantities of gold had been discovered. The frenzy to get to California was accelerated by the belief that gold nuggets being found in stream beds would not be found for long. By the time of the Civil War, the gold rush was essentially over.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-men-do-for-the-us-to-enter-california-in-1849>What did men do for the US to enter California in 1849?</h2>
<p>Arriving in covered wagons, clipper ships, and on horseback, some 300,000 migrants, known as “forty-niners” (named for the year they began to arrive in California, 1849), staked claims to spots of land around the river, where they used pans to extract gold from silt deposits.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-at-the-time-of-the-gold-rush>Who was president at the time of the Gold Rush?</h2>
<p>Although the original discovery of the gold at Sutter’s Mill occurred in January of 1848, the United States government did not officially recognize the discovery until December 5, 1848 when President James Polk confirmed the discovery in his address to the United States Congressional leaders.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-when-gold-was-discovered-in-california>Who was president when gold was discovered in California?</h2>
<p>On Dec. 5, 1848, President James K. Polk confirmed in his State of the Union address that large quantities of gold had been discovered in California. Part of an independent Mexico since 1821, Alta (or Upper) California was long seen as a territory ripe for development, initially by those in agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-governor-of-california-during-the-gold-rush>Who was the Governor of California during the Gold Rush?</h2>
<p>Military governor Colonel Richard B. Mason, who toured the gold fields, wrote a report that contained astounding facts: two miners on Weber Creek gathered $17,000 in gold in seven days; six miners with 50 Indians took out 273 pounds of gold; sales at Sam Brannan’s merchandise store near the mines totaled $36,000 in May, June and early July.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-gold-found-in-the-california-gold-rush>Where was the gold found in the California Gold Rush?</h2>
<p>On January 24, 1848 while Marshall was inspecting his mill, he discovered gold in the water. He was uncertain whether it was truly gold. After undergoing several tests, it was determined to indeed be gold and was sent to President Polk in Washington DC.</p>
