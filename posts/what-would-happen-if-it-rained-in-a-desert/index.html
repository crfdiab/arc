<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-it-rained-in-a-desert>What would happen if it rained in a desert?</h2>
<p>Even a single heavy rain in or near any of the world’s deserts proves that they lack the capacity to store or even slow water. You can expect major flooding throughout the basin but not much retained surface water except in local basins that have no outlet. That won’t make a desert green.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-rain-affect-our-life>How did rain affect our life?</h2>
<p>Heavy rainfall can lead to numerous hazards, for example: flooding, including risk to human life, damage to buildings and infrastructure, and loss of crops and livestock. landslides, which can threaten human life, disrupt transport and communications, and cause damage to buildings and infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-rain-so-important-for-us>Why is rain so important for us?</h2>
<p>Rainfall is very important for the survival of plants and animals. It brings fresh water to the earth’s surface. If rainfall is less, there is water scarcity which sometime causes drought like situation. If there is excess rain, floods take place which make the life of the affected people miserable.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-rain-important-for-us>Why is rain important for us?</h2>
<p>Complete answer: For the survival of plants and animals, rainfall is very important. It helps in bringing fresh water to the surface of the earth. If it is less than water scarcity and drought are likely to occur. On the other hand, if it is more, then the floods can also take place.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-it-rains-in-the-desert>What happens when it rains in the desert?</h2>
<p>If the desert gets heavy rainfall during their spring season which is October and November, there will be a sudden bloom of the flowers ‘hibernating’ beneath its surface. It fills the entire desert with an explosion of color by the flowers coming to their full bloom which is eagerly waiting for the rain, leaving the place as heaven on the earth.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-rain-would-it-take-to-make-the-sahara-desert-habitable>How much rain would it take to make the Sahara desert habitable?</h2>
<p>With even 304 inches of rain, it would still take a thousand years to make the Sahara even habitable, and that’s not even a rainforest! Decrease that thousand years to one hundred, and all you’re going to get from this much rain would be just mere shrubs and grass.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-thing-about-living-in-the-desert>What’s the best thing about living in the desert?</h2>
<p>But in New Mexico when it rains it’s almost required that you go outside and jump around in the rain and shout HALLELUJAHHHH. And desert rain smells incredible, like sweet dirt and freshly cut grass and dry air and basically God’s perfume if God wore perfume. 4. Storms are way more impressive.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-it-rains-in-the-atacama-desert>What happens when it rains in the Atacama Desert?</h2>
<p>But I found one very fascinating and amazing phenomenon. When it rains suddenly in the Atacama desert in Chile, which is the driest non-polar desert on Earth, there will be a sudden spur of life in the desert.</p>
