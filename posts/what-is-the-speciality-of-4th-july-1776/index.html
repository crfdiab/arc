<h2 id=what-is-the-speciality-of-4th-july-1776>What is the Speciality of 4th July 1776?</h2>
<p>From 1776 to the present day, July 4th has been celebrated as the birth of American independence, with festivities ranging from fireworks, parades and concerts to more casual family gatherings and barbecues.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-special-on-4th-july-in-america>What is the special on 4th July in America?</h2>
<p>Independence Day — known colloquially as the Fourth of July — is celebrated in the United States on July 4 annually to mark the Declaration of Independence signifying the freedom of the thirteen American colonies from British rule back in the 18th century.</p>
<h2 id=which-presidents-died-on-july-4th>Which presidents died on July 4th?</h2>
<p>It is a fact of American history that three Founding Father Presidents—John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Monroe—died on July 4, the Independence Day anniversary. But was it just a coincidence?</p>
<h2 id=is-4th-of-july-americas-birthday>Is 4th of July America’s birthday?</h2>
<p>The Fourth of July is celebrated as America’s Independence Day in observance of July 4, 1776, when representatives from the 13 colonies that became the United States approved the historic Declaration of Independence, a grand announcement of the colonies’ self-declared independence from England.</p>
<h2 id=were-any-presidents-born-on-july-4>Were any presidents born on July 4?</h2>
<p>The only president of the United States to be born on July 4 was Calvin Coolidge (30th). He was born in Plymouth, Vermont, on July 4, 1872.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-declaration-of-independence-signed-in-1776>Where was the declaration of Independence signed in 1776?</h2>
<p>The members of the Continental Congress signed the declaration in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, a day subsequently celebrated as Independence Day in the United States. Architect of the Capitol</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-second-day-of-july-1776>When was the second day of July 1776?</h2>
<p>The second day of July 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-americans-celebrate-independence-day-in-1777>When did Americans celebrate Independence Day in 1777?</h2>
<p>Unofficially*, the celebrations started just a year after the Declaration was ratified. A July 18, 1777 issue of the Virginia Gazette —but with the article dated July 5—describes the scene in Philadelphia, and it sounds awfully familiar:</p>
