<h2 id=what-is-the-highest-number-for-an-earthquake>What is the highest number for an earthquake?</h2>
<p>According to the USGS, earthquakes of magnitude 10 or larger cannot happen. The largest earthquake ever recorded was a magnitude 9.5. It occurred in 1960 near Valdivia, Chile, where the Nazca plate subducts under the South American plate.</p>
<h2 id=how-rare-is-a-magnitude-7-earthquake>How rare is a magnitude 7 earthquake?</h2>
<table><tr><th>Magnitude</th><th>Earthquake Effects</th><th>Estimated Number Each Year</th></tr><tr><td>6.1 to 6.9</td><td>May cause a lot of damage in very populated areas.</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>7.0 to 7.9</td><td>Major earthquake. Serious damage.</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>8.0 or greater</td><td>Great earthquake. Can totally destroy communities near the epicenter.</td><td>One every 5 to 10 years</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=whats-the-biggest-earthquake>What’s the biggest earthquake?</h2>
<p>“The Great Chilean Earthquake”. The world’s largest earthquake with an instrumentally documented magnitude occurred on May 22, 1960 near Valdivia, in southern Chile. It was assigned a magnitude of 9.5 by the United States Geological Survey.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-magnitude-of-a-major-earthquake>What is the magnitude of a major earthquake?</h2>
<p>Magnitude: Great: 8 or more: Major: 7 – 7.9: Strong: 6 – 6.9: Moderate: 5 – 5.9: Light: 4 – 4.9: Minor: 3 -3.9</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-number-of-earthquakes-in-a-year>What’s the average number of earthquakes in a year?</h2>
<p>Earthquake Effects Estimated Number Each Year 2.5 or less Usually not felt, but can be recorded by seismograph. 900,000 2.5 to 5.4 Often felt, but only causes minor damage. 30,000 5.5 to 6.0 Slight damage to buildings and other structures. 500 6.1 to 6.9 May cause a lot of damage in very populated areas. 100 7.0 to 7.9 Major earthquake.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-earthquake-of-the-20th-century>Which is the largest earthquake of the 20th century?</h2>
<p>The United States Geological Survey reports this event as the “largest earthquake of the 20th Century.”. Other earthquakes in recorded history may have been larger; however, this is the largest earthquake that has occurred since accurate estimates of magnitude became possible in the early 1900s.</p>
