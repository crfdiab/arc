<h2 id=how-many-people-watched-the-ncaa-march-madness>How many people watched the NCAA March Madness?</h2>
<p>The 2021 NCAA men’s basketball championship game attracted an average of 16.9 million viewers to CBS Sports on Monday, a 14% decline from the 2019 game. The 2020 contest was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-views-does-march-madness-generate>How many views does March Madness generate?</h2>
<p>Throughout the eight games, the average of 6.46 million viewers was an improvement from the 5.74 million viewers that watched two years ago, per Sportico’s Anthony Cupri.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-march-madness-each-year>How many people March Madness each year?</h2>
<p>(March Madness was cancelled in 2020 due to the Covid-19 outbreak.) About 31 million Americans are placing more traditional bets on this year’s tournament, up from nearly 18 million in 2019.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-march-madness-brackets-are-filled-out-each-year>How many March Madness brackets are filled out each year?</h2>
<p>With more than three decades of online and paper brackets to sift through (the current format has existed since 1985) and with somewhere between an estimated 60 million to 100 million brackets filled out every year, it’s very possible that someone, somewhere has done better.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-watched-basketball-game-ever>What is the most watched basketball game ever?</h2>
<p>The highest-rated NBA Finals is the 1998 championship series between the Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz, Michael Jordan’s last Finals series. The series averaged 29.04 million viewers. An astounding 35.89 million people watched the clinching Game 6 — the most watched basketball game in history.</p>
<h2 id=is-march-madness-more-popular-than-the-nba>Is March Madness more popular than the NBA?</h2>
<p>But more people watched the NCAA Final Four than the NBA Finals. Yes. The NCAA Final Four averaged an 11.0 rating and 18.3 million viewers over three games, according to figures compiled by this website (CBS and Turner Sports did not release averages for the round).</p>
<h2 id=can-college-players-make-money>Can college players make money?</h2>
<p>Here’s how college athletes can now make money, according to the NCAA’s new policy. On Wednesday, the NCAA announced an interim policy that allows student athletes from all three divisions to monetize their name, image and likeness, often referred to as NIL. The new policy goes into effect Thursday, July 1.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-is-gambled-on-the-ncaa-tournament>How much money is gambled on the NCAA Tournament?</h2>
<p>How much is bet on the tournament? The NCAA says illegal wagers total more than $2.5 billion a year. The American Gaming Association puts legal and illegal gambling at $9 billion. It’s not clear where these figures come from or what they’re based on, though.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-bet-on-march-madness>Is it legal to bet on March Madness?</h2>
<p>Yet if you create a tournament bracket for March Madness or any other sporting event, you could be violating federal, state or local laws that ban workplace gambling of any kind. In addition, many states have laws that prohibit gambling, with exceptions that may include casinos, state lotteries and horse racing.</p>
<h2 id=has-anyone-had-a-perfect-bracket>Has anyone had a perfect bracket?</h2>
<p>There has never been a perfect bracket. However, a guy named Gregg Nigl got the first 49 game winner picks right in 2019.</p>
<h2 id=has-there-ever-been-a-final-four-without-a-1-seed>Has there ever been a Final Four without a 1 seed?</h2>
<p>While the most common occurrence is only one No. 1 seed making the Final Four (15 of the 35 years since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985), two or more No. 1 seeds have made the Final Four in 18 NCAA tournaments (51.4 percent of the time).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-average-tv-audience-for-march-madness>What was the average TV audience for March Madness?</h2>
<p>Last year’s title game (Villanova over Michigan) aired on Turner and averaged 16 television million viewers, making it the least watched title game. When viewing from streaming is added from the March Madness Live app, the average-minute audience grew to 16.5 million viewers.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-times-has-kentucky-played-in-march-madness>How many times has Kentucky played in March Madness?</h2>
<p>The Kentucky Wildcats have played in a record 181 March Madness games between 1942 and 2019, lifting the trophy eight times during that period. In 2019, the tournament had an average TV viewership of 10.5 million viewers.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-watch-the-ncaa-basketball-tournament>How many people watch the NCAA Basketball Tournament?</h2>
<p>The attention paid to the sport heightens each year with the start of the college basketball tournament – often referred to as March Madness. The championship game in 2017 for example had a TV viewership of 23 million.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-will-miss-work-because-of-march-madness>How many people will miss work because of March Madness?</h2>
<p>WalletHub estimates 56% of millennials will be willing to miss a work deadline because of “March Madness.” 81% of offices say they have no policy for pools. 89% say office pools build better camaraderie with workers.</p>
