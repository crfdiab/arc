<h2 id=what-is-the-result-of-headward-erosion>What is the result of Headward erosion?</h2>
<p>Headward erosion is a fluvial process of erosion that lengthens a stream, a valley or a gully at its head and also enlarges its drainage basin. The stream erodes away at the rock and soil at its headwaters in the opposite direction that it flows.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-in-erosion-in-rivers>What happens in erosion in rivers?</h2>
<p>Erosion is the process that wears away the river bed and banks. Erosion also breaks up the rocks that are carried by the river. Hydraulic action – This is the sheer power of the water as it smashes against the river banks. Air becomes trapped in the cracks of the river bank and bed, and causes the rock to break apart.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-erosion-when-forming-rivers>What causes erosion when forming rivers?</h2>
<p>Water flowing over Earth’s surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-4-processes-of-river-erosion>What are the 4 processes of river erosion?</h2>
<p>Erosion There are four ways that a river erodes; hydraulic action, corrosion, corrosion and attrition. Hydraulic action – the force of the water wearing away the bed and bank of the river • Corrosion – the chemical reaction between the water and the bed and bank of the river, wearing it away.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-erosion>What are the different types of erosion?</h2>
<p>The main forms of erosion are:</p>
<ul>
<li>surface erosion.</li>
<li>fluvial erosion.</li>
<li>mass-movement erosion.</li>
<li>streambank erosion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-a-headward-erosion-in-geography>What is a Headward erosion in geography?</h2>
<p>Waterfalls continue to erode backwards in a process called headward erosion. This is when the hard and soft rock is all worn away and the river returns to its original slope. Cataracts are large vertical falls of water and cascades are waterfalls that fall over a series of smaller steps or drops.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-erosion-and-deposition-of-a-river>What is erosion and deposition of a river?</h2>
<p>When the stream comes down from the hills to plain areas with the eroded and transported materials, the absence of slope/gradient causes the river to lose it energy to further carry those transported materials. As a result, the load of the river starts to settle down which is termed as deposition.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-stages-of-erosion>What are the 3 stages of erosion?</h2>
<p>Erosion involved three processes: detachment (from the ground), transportation (via water or wind), and deposition. The deposition is often in places we don’t want the soil such as streams, lakes, reservoirs, or deltas.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-erosion-transportation-and-deposition-affect-a-river>How does erosion, transportation and deposition affect a river?</h2>
<p>These are erosion, transportation and deposition. All three depend on the amount of energy there is in a river. The energy in a river causes erosion. The bed and banks can be eroded making it wider, deeper and longer. Headward erosion makes a river longer. This erosion happens near its source.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-main-processes-that-occur-in-a-river>What are the three main processes that occur in a river?</h2>
<p>There are three main types of processes that occur in a river. These are erosion, transportation and deposition. All three depend on the amount of energy there is in a river. The energy in a river causes erosion.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-river-bank-erosion>Which is an example of river bank erosion?</h2>
<p>Some parts of the river bank lines are considered as inter-state or inter-country borders. This has happened between West Bengal and Jharkhand in the Malda district. River-course changes due to bank erosion (submerge of land on the left bank and emergence of new land on the right bank of the river).</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-pressure-of-water-cause-a-river-to-collapse>How does the pressure of water cause a river to collapse?</h2>
<p>The pressure of water breaks away rock particles from the river bed and banks. The force of the water hits river banks and then pushes water into cracks. Air becomes compressed, pressure increases and the riverbank may, in time collapse.</p>
