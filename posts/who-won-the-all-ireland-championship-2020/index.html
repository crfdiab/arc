<h2 id=who-won-the-all-ireland-championship-2020>Who won the All-Ireland Championship 2020?</h2>
<p>Dublin<br>
In June, the GAA announced that the 2020 championship would be straight knock-out, the first straight-knockout since 2000. Thirty teams took part – thirty of the thirty-two counties of Ireland…</p>
<h2 id=who-won-todays-all-ireland-final>Who won today’s All-Ireland final?</h2>
<p>Cork beat Leinster champions Kilkenny for the right to play Limerick in the All-Ireland hurling final – relive the action here.</p>
<h2 id=did-dublin-win>Did Dublin win?</h2>
<p>James Horan’s side claim stunning extra-time victory to end Dublin’s long unbeaten run. So it ended. Dublin, losing altitude all season, finally fell to earth. Champions for the past unparalleled six years, they met a Mayo team with momentum and spirit and their diminished powers proved inadequate to the challenge.</p>
<h2 id=what-time-is-the-all-ireland-hurling-final-2021>What time is the All-Ireland Hurling Final 2021?</h2>
<p>Cork v Galway will now throw-in at 7.30pm on Wednesday August 18th at Thurles. Next week’s All-Ireland Under-20 hurling final has been pushed back by 24 hours. The clash between Cork and Galway will now take place in Thurles on Wednesday evening.</p>
<h2 id=who-won-gaelic-football-final-2020>Who won Gaelic Football Final 2020?</h2>
<p>Reigning All-Ireland SFC and Leinster champions Dublin took on Connacht champions Mayo, with Dublin bidding to become the first Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) team to win six consecutive editions of the competition. The match was played at Croke Park in Dublin on 19 December 2020.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-backdoor-in-hurling-this-year>Is there a backdoor in hurling this year?</h2>
<p>No, the real competition flaw this year is that for a second consecutive year there will be no backdoor for footballers while there is one provided for hurlers.</p>
<h2 id=who-won-between-mayo-and-dublin>Who won between Mayo and Dublin?</h2>
<p>Recap: Mayo 0-17 Dublin 0-14 (AET)</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-tyrone-won-the-ulster-football-championship>When was the last time Tyrone won the Ulster Football Championship?</h2>
<p>Tyrone have won one Ulster title (2017), and were in last year’s All-Ireland final, and the semi-final a year earlier. Beaten by eventual winners Dublin in both. But they’re down in fourth in the league rankings. A consistent Division 1 team but they last contested a final in 2013. (+1)</p>
<h2 id=how-are-teams-ranked-in-the-irish-football-championship>How are teams ranked in the Irish Football Championship?</h2>
<p>League finishes were combined for the 2017-19 seasons, while teams were ranked in each of the 2017, 2018 and 2019 (so far) championships based on the stage at which their respective seasons ended: winners, runner up, semi-finalist, last eight, and qualifiers round 4 to 1.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-top-teams-in-the-football-championship>Who are the top teams in the Football Championship?</h2>
<p>Jim Gavin’s team are atop of the league rankings despite their no show this year, after winning the final last summer and reaching the final the year before. They’ve won the last three Leinsters and the last two All-Irelands in this rankings cycle, they’re back in the Super 8s and eyeing a historic five in a row.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-monaghan-football-team-in-the-championship>Is the Monaghan football team in the championship?</h2>
<p>Monaghan are a consistent Division 1 league team, but their championship ranking goes down after this year’s round two exit. Four years since their last Ulster title, they were fortunate to avoid league relegation too. They’ll have a new manager in 2020 who will need to halt the decline.</p>
