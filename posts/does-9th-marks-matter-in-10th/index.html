<h2 id=does-9th-marks-matter-in-10th>Does 9th marks matter in 10th?</h2>
<p>No marks of 9th standard are not added to 10th. It doesn’t matter how much you score in 9th standard. You just have to clear 9th standard so that you can get admission in 10th standard.</p>

<p>Grade 9 lays the foundation for grade 10 There is a reason why certain concepts are taught to you in grade 9. These form the foundation of the syllabus for your board exam. Without mastering these concepts first, you will not be able to fully understand your board syllabus.</p>
<h2 id=is-10th-easier-than-9th>Is 10th easier than 9th?</h2>

<p>Yet, is eighth-grade really that different than ninth? The answer is yes, but not in the way one might think. The stereotype is that high school means a lot of homework, but I have found there is less. The material is hard, but it’s taught in such a way that makes it seem easy.</p>
