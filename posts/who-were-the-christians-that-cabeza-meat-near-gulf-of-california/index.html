<p>Section 107. At that very time, the Quevenes told Cabeza de Vaca astonishing news. Across the wide expanse of the bay there were “three Christians like him,” and the Indians gave him their names. They were Alonso del Castillo, Andrés Dorantes, and the his slave Estevanico.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-spaniards-doing-when-cabeza-met-them>What were the Spaniards doing when Cabeza met them?</h2>
<p>What were the Spaniards doing when Cabeza met up with them? They were on a slave catching expedition. They also thought that Cabeza cured the sick, and the Spaniards killed “well” men. They thought the Spaniards just came finely dressed and with lances, and Cabeza just came naked and barefoot and ready to help.</p>
<h2 id=what-native-texan-tribe-does-cabeza-de-vaca-meet>What native Texan tribe does Cabeza de Vaca meet?</h2>
<p>the Quevenes<br>
Their journey went well until the two men confronted Matagorda Bay. There they encountered an Indian tribe, which Cabeza de Vaca called the Quevenes, who threatened to kill them by placing arrows over their hearts.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-cabeza-de-vaca-work-for>Who did Cabeza de Vaca work for?</h2>
<p>Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca Núñez was treasurer to the Spanish expedition under Pánfilo de Narváez that reached what is now Tampa Bay, Florida, in 1528. By September all but his party of 60 had perished; it reached the shore near present-day Galveston, Texas.</p>
<h2 id=which-expedition-did-not-come-ashore-in-texas>Which expedition did not come ashore in Texas?</h2>

<h2 id=why-did-panfilo-de-narvaez-go-to-florida>Why did Panfilo de Narvaez go to Florida?</h2>
<p>After surviving a hurricane near Cuba, his expedition landed on the west coast of Florida (near Tampa Bay) in April, 1528, claiming the land for Spain. A series of hurricanes and fights with Native Americans killed many of the crew, and the pilot of the ship sailed to Mexico without the men.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-idea-of-this-document-how-does-cabeza-survived>What is the main idea of this document How does Cabeza survived?</h2>
<p>How does it explain why Cabeza survived? i. The main idea of this document is to show how Cabeza handled the different obstacles that he faced. It explains why Cabeza survived by describing what he did to find solutions to the problems he experienced during his trek 6.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-non-native-explorer-to-ever-see-texas>Who was the first non native explorer to ever see Texas?</h2>
<p>Cabeza de Vaca rejected the suggestion of cowardice and participated in the overland march. He later wrote, “I preferred risking my life to placing my honor in jeopardy.” Narváez and his men set off overland in early May, 1528. They marched north for 15 days without seeing any Indians or native settlements.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-cabeza-de-vaca-trying-to-go>Where was Cabeza de Vaca trying to go?</h2>
<p>Cabeza de Vaca returned to Spain in 1537 and expressed outrage at the Spanish treatment of Indians. He led an expedition in 1541 and 1542 from Santos, Brazil to Asuncion, Paraguay….</p>

<h2 id=what-was-cabeza-de-vacas-goal>What was Cabeza de Vaca’s goal?</h2>
