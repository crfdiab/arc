<h2 id=how-did-napoleon-bring-peace-to-europe>How did Napoleon bring peace to Europe?</h2>
<p>If ever a ruler owed his position to what is called the “will of the people,” Napoleon did. Napoleon won it by his success with the sword, not the sword of execution, nor the sword of the guillotine, but the sword of battle against the enemies of France.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-napoleon-do-1802>What did Napoleon do 1802?</h2>
<p>One of his most significant accomplishments was the Napoleonic Code, which streamlined the French legal system and continues to form the foundation of French civil law to this day. In 1802, a constitutional amendment made Napoleon first consul for life.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-napoleon-sign-the-peace-treaty-of-1802>Why did Napoleon sign the peace treaty of 1802?</h2>
<p>He used the time of peace to consolidate power and reorganise domestic administration in France and some of its client states. His effective annexation of the Cisalpine Republic and his decision to send French troops into the Helvetian Republic (Switzerland) in October 1802, was another violation of Lunéville.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-napoleon-do-in-1802-to-give-himself-more-power>What did Napoleon do in 1802 to give himself more power?</h2>
<p>In May 1802, Bonaparte amended the Constitution to grant himself the title First Consul for Life, with near dictatorial powers – a king in all but name. He wanted a crown, to be recognized on the same footing as the monarchs of Europe. Bonaparte would make himself Emperor of France.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-directory-allow-napoleon-to-invade-egypt>Why did the directory allow Napoleon to invade Egypt?</h2>
<p>In early 1798, Bonaparte proposed a military expedition to seize Egypt. In a letter to the Directory, he suggested this would protect French trade interests, attack British commerce, and undermine Britain’s access to India and the East Indies, since Egypt was well-placed on the trade routes to these places.</p>
<h2 id=who-declared-the-end-of-the-french-revolution>WHO declared the end of the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>Napoleon<br>
1804: Napoleon Becomes Emperor This is perhaps the most obvious date to use as the end of the revolution, although Napoleon had been building his power since the Consulate. France was transformed into a new form of nation and government, one considered almost opposite to the hopes of many revolutionaries.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-napoleon-do-on-june-24-1812-and-why-is-that-his-biggest-mistake>What did Napoleon do on June 24 1812 and why is that his biggest mistake?</h2>
<p>What did Napoleon do on June 24, 1812 and why is that his “biggest mistake”? -history/napoleons-grande-armee-invades-russiaNapoleon’s grande army invaded russia , this was the biggest mistake because he and his army were faced with russia’s suddenly aggressive and merciless army , they were faced by hunger and the …</p>
<h2 id=how-napoleon-became-a-hero-in-france>How Napoleon became a hero in France?</h2>
<p>Napoleon became a hero to france because when the rebels went National Convention, an official of the national assembly told Napoleon to defend the delegates and then Napoleon told the gunners to have a lot of royalists with a cannonade and he also pushed the British out of Toulon.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-napoleon-considered-a-man-of-peace>Why was Napoleon considered a man of peace?</h2>
<p>Like all soldiers who have seen battle, Napoleon had a horror of war. He was sentimental and good. He loved the people and his soldiers like they were his children. Never in his entire life did he start a single war.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-napoleon-i-do-in-continental-europe>What did Napoleon I do in continental Europe?</h2>
<p>In continental Europe he advanced beyond France’s natural frontiers, incorporating Piedmont into France, imposing a more centralized government on the Swiss Confederation, and in Germany compensating the princes dispossessed of territory on the Rhine under the Treaty of Lunéville with shares of the secularized ecclesiastical states.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-napoleon-sign-the-treaty-of-amiens>When did Napoleon sign the Treaty of Amiens?</h2>
<p>He kept his word, as did those who succeeded him, except during the brief interval of peace under the Treaty of Amiens from the 25th of March 1802 to the 16th of May 1803. So, then! Napoleon was in no way responsible for the annexation of Belgium. It was the Convention of August 1795 that made it a French province.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-napoleon-want-to-be-the-emperor-of-france>Why did Napoleon want to be the emperor of France?</h2>
<p>The people of France elected Napoleon as the Emperor, because he saved France from its enemies and he defended the gains of the Revolution at home. Napoleon established both the Bank of France and the French bourse (stock exchange) as well as National and Departmental Tax Boards, to insure equitable taxation for all.</p>
