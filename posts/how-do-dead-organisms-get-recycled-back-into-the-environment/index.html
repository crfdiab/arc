<h2 id=how-do-dead-organisms-get-recycled-back-into-the-environment>How do dead organisms get recycled back into the environment?</h2>
<p>Decomposers (Figure below) get nutrients and energy by breaking down dead organisms and animal wastes. Through this process, decomposers release nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen, back into the environment. These nutrients are recycled back into the ecosystem so that the producers can use them.</p>
<h2 id=what-recycles-the-dead-stuff-in-an-ecosystem>What recycles the dead stuff in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Nature has its own recycling system: a group of organisms called decomposers. Decomposers feed on dead things: dead plant materials such as leaf litter and wood, animal carcasses, and feces. They perform a valuable service as Earth’s cleanup crew.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-dead-organisms-important-to-the-ecosystem>Why are dead organisms important to the ecosystem?</h2>
<p>We use decomposers to restore the natural nutrient cycle through controlled composting. Decomposers are the link that keeps the circle of life in motion. The nutrients that decomposers release into the environment become part of the soil, making it fertile and good for plant growth.</p>
<h2 id=which-organisms-are-responsible-for-decay>Which organisms are responsible for decay?</h2>
<p>The main groups of decomposer organisms are bacteria and fungi. Bacteria are single-celled microscopic organisms. Fungi are often larger organisms that include moulds and mushrooms. They both cause decay by releasing enzymes which break down compounds in their food so it can be absorbed by their cells.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-nutrients-recycled-in-an-ecosystem>How are the nutrients recycled in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms. The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots. Click to see full answer</p>
<h2 id=how-are-chemical-elements-recycled-in-living-things>How are chemical elements recycled in living things?</h2>
<p>All chemical elements that are needed by living things are recycled in ecosystems, including carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Water is also recycled. Biogeochemical Cycles</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-carbon-dioxide-when-it-is-recycled>What happens to carbon dioxide when it is recycled?</h2>
<p>Along the way, it releases carbon dioxide back into the air as waste. That sends carbon back for reuse as part of that never-ending carbon cycle. But carbon is far from the only thing that gets recycled this way. Rot also releases nitrogen, phosphorus and about two dozen other nutrients. Living things need these to grow and prosper.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-nitrogen-affect-the-recycling-of-the-dead>How does nitrogen affect the recycling of the dead?</h2>
<p>Higher nitrogen levels seem to reduce the ability of microbes to make the enzymes needed to break down dead tissues. As a result, plant litter on the forest floor will get recycled more slowly. That can affect the overall health of the area’s living trees and other plants.</p>
