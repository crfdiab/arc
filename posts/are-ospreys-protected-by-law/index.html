<h2 id=are-ospreys-protected-by-law>Are Ospreys protected by law?</h2>
<p>In the US, Osprey are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). A MBTA permit can be requested from your regional US Fish and Wildlife Service field office. In some instances a nest may be relocated to a nearby structure.</p>
<h2 id=are-ospreys-endangered>Are Ospreys endangered?</h2>
<p>Least Concern (Population increasing)<br>
Osprey/Conservation status</p>
<h2 id=do-nj-ospreys-migrate>Do NJ Ospreys migrate?</h2>
<p>In late August and early September, ospreys leave New Jersey for their wintering grounds.</p>
<h2 id=do-eagles-kill-ospreys>Do eagles kill Ospreys?</h2>
<p>Eagle attacks ospreys At dusk, with both osprey parents away, the bald eagle sweeps in from over the water toward the nest containing three chicks. They do, however, vigorously chase birds that encroach on their nests.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-destroy-an-osprey-nest>Is it illegal to destroy an osprey nest?</h2>
<p>According to the website of the Chesapeake Bay field office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, an osprey nest “can be removed without a permit if the nest is inactive. A nest is considered inactive if there are no eggs or young present in the nest. To remove an active nest requires a permit.”</p>
<h2 id=do-osprey-have-predators>Do osprey have predators?</h2>
<p>Adult ospreys do not have many predators, although great horned owls and bald eagles have been known to sometimes kill osprey chicks and adults. The primary predator is the raccoon, who will steal and eat osprey eggs found in nests.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-own-a-osprey>Can you own a osprey?</h2>
<p>In most states it is illegal to own an osprey as a pet.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-do-if-you-find-a-dead-osprey>What do you do if you find a dead osprey?</h2>
<p>Contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator Call your state’s US Fish and Wildlife Service office, or: Call 911 and ask for assistance. The bird may not actually be in need of rescue, so until you have talked to a rehabilitator, don’t attempt to move it or approach it unless it is in danger of being hit or eaten.</p>
<h2 id=do-ospreys-return-to-the-same-nest-every-year>Do Ospreys return to the same nest every year?</h2>
<p>Twigs and large sticks make up the majority of an osprey nest. Often, smaller bird species such as starlings or house sparrows live in the underside of the nest. Ospreys tend to return to the same nest year after year. Upon arrival, both the male and female osprey update the nest with the latest and greatest materials.</p>
<h2 id=what-kills-osprey-the-most>What kills osprey the most?</h2>
<h2 id=which-is-bigger-osprey-or-eagle>Which is bigger Osprey or eagle?</h2>
<p>Size: Osprey have an average 59- to 70-inch wingspan and weigh 3-4 pounds. The bald eagle is one of the largest birds in North America, with an average 80-inch wingspan and weighing 6.5 to almost 14 pounds. 2. Diet: Osprey eat a diet of about 99 percent fish, usually 4-12 inches long.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-osprey-listed-as-endangered-in-new-jersey>When was the Osprey listed as endangered in New Jersey?</h2>
<p>In New Jersey the osprey was listed as endangered in 1973 by the NJ Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife. Early recovery efforts began when DDT was banned in New Jersey in 1968.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-osprey-protected-under-the-migratory-bird-treaty-act>Is the Osprey protected under the migratory bird treaty act?</h2>
<p>Yes, Ospreys are Federally protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Each estate has laws that protect Ospreys to various degrees.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-osprey-live-in-the-united-states>Where do osprey live in the United States?</h2>
<p>Osprey Facts Range The osprey is found on every continent except Antarctica. In North America, they nest along the coasts and large inland lakes. Nesting along rivers is increasing. Osprey overwinter from Florida to Mexico and even into South America. Status</p>
<h2 id=where-are-osprey-nesting-platforms-in-new-jersey>Where are osprey nesting platforms in New Jersey?</h2>
<p>Since 2004, we have installed over 200 nesting platforms throughout New Jersey, most in areas where suitable habitat exists with few nesting structures and others to replace old and unsafe structures. We have concentrated much of our work on Barnegat Bay, Little Egg Harbor, and Great Bay.</p>
