<p>After the collège students attend the lycée (high school) for the final three years of secondary education. Students then take an examination to receive the baccalauréat (bac) qualification. The baccalauréat is equivalent to the US high school diploma, but differs in that it requires preparatory study.</p>

<p>There is little leeway for a foreign child adapting to the French education system: it is done the school’s way or not at all. The primary years in a French school can be very challenging but also stimulating and rewarding. Very little learning support exists for the able, or less able, child.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-schools-do-they-have-in-france>What kind of schools do they have in France?</h2>
<p>French education is divided into primary level ( école ), elementary or middle school ( collège) and high school ( lycée ). To read about the French education system, see Expatica’s guide to the school system in France.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-english-and-french-high-schools>What’s the difference between English and French high schools?</h2>

<h2 id=how-many-grades-do-you-get-in-french-school>How many grades do you get in French school?</h2>
<p>Navigating the French school system and the equivalent US/UK grades can be tricky. Here’s a list of each grade as well as related French school vocabulary and French school supply vocabulary. La petite section de maternelle ou PS (3 ans) = Nursery. Read my thoughts about switching from an American to a French preschool system.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-go-to-high-school-in-france>How old do you have to be to go to high school in France?</h2>
<p>Studies in France are compulsory until you reach 16 years old, but they can be in school or in some kind of study/apprentice program. High school in France is sometimes referred to as “le second cycle des études secondaires”. Here are the various French high school grades: La seconde (15 ans) = 10th grade (Year 11 UK).</p>
