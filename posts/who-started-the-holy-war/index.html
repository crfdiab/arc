<h2 id=who-started-the-holy-war>Who started the holy war?</h2>
<p>Pope Urban II<br>
The great series of western holy wars were the Crusades, which lasted from 1095 until 1291 CE. The aim was to capture the sacred places in the Holy Land from the Muslims who lived there, so it was intended as a war to right wrongs done against Christianity. The first Crusade was started by Pope Urban II in 1095.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-demon-king-seven-deadly-sins>Who is the demon king seven deadly sins?</h2>
<p>The Demon King is the main antagonist of the anime and manga series Seven Deadly Sins. He is the supreme ruler of Purgatory who commands the Demon Clan and the creator of the Ten Commandments. He is also the father of Meliodas and Zeldris.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-new-law-of-jesus>What is the new law of Jesus?</h2>
<p>While the New Testament records several unique sayings of Jesus that may be described as “commandments,” it only records one that he explicitly identified as such. This is the New Commandment of John 13:34–35 that the disciples should love one another as he himself had loved them.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-muslim-conquest-of-the-levant>Who was the leader of the Muslim conquest of the Levant?</h2>
<p>After the Farewell Pilgrimage in 632, the Prophet Muhammad appointed Usama ibn Zayd as the commander of an expeditionary force which was to invade the region of Balqa in the Byzantine Empire.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-pope-to-travel-to-the-holy-land>Who was the first pope to travel to the Holy Land?</h2>
<p>As a geographic term, the description “Holy Land” loosely encompasses modern-day Israel, the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, western Jordan and south-western Syria. On 4 January 1964, Paul VI made the first travel of a reigning pontiff in the Holy Land.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-crusaders-stop-going-to-the-holy-land>When did the Crusaders stop going to the Holy Land?</h2>
<p>The Crusaders were no longer able to receive their promised payments from Alexios. Following the murder of Alexios on 8 February, the Crusaders decided on the outright conquest of the city. In April 1204, they captured and plundered the city’s enormous wealth. Only a handful of the Crusaders continued to the Holy Land thereafter.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-governor-of-mosul-during-the-crusades>Who was the Governor of Mosul during the Crusades?</h2>
<p>In 1144, the Seljuk general Zangi, governor of Mosul, captured Edessa, leading to the loss of the northernmost Crusader state. News of Edessa’s fall stunned Europe and caused Christian authorities in the West to call for another Crusade.</p>
