<h2 id=why-are-japanese-cars-more-reliable-than-american>Why are Japanese cars more reliable than American?</h2>
<p>The main reasons that Japanese cars consistently rate higher in terms of quality than US cars are: Japanese cars are built by two world-class manufacturers: Honda and Toyota. It has little to do with “Japan vs. USA” and everything to do with different styles of corporate management.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-the-best-automotive-industry>Which country has the best automotive industry?</h2>
<ol>
<li>China. China, well-known as the world’s biggest manufacturer, is the leading producer of cars.</li>
<li>United States of America. The United States produced only 11 million cars and trucks in 2019, but still, it is the second-largest car manufacturer in the world, with just under 12% market share.</li>
<li>Japan.</li>
<li>Germany.</li>
<li>India.</li>
<li>Mexico.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=why-was-the-japanese-automobile-industry-so-successful>Why was the Japanese automobile industry so successful?</h2>
<p>The more successful the Japanese automobile industry, MITI has argued, the worse the economic impact on Japan. The automobile, it has pointed out, requires the two raw materials that are in shortest supply in Japan: petroleum and iron ore.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-japan-so-successful-in-the-world>Why was Japan so successful in the world?</h2>
<p>Here is two reasons of the success. After WW2, Japan was successful in processing trading, which we imported natural resources from China, Russia, the US,etc. and processed cars, steals ,etc. in Japan and then exported them. The Japanese’s hard working is also the cause of the success. Many of the Japanese have worked 9am-11pm every weekdays.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-largest-car-manufacturer-in-japan>Who is the largest car manufacturer in Japan?</h2>
<p>Toyota remains the largest automaker in the world by volume. Japanese automotive production is also recently on the rise. As car manufacturers are taking more focus on foreign markets, their investments in innovation and increasing exports are expected to grow as a result.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-japanese-car-manufacturers-under-global-pressure>Why are Japanese car manufacturers under global pressure?</h2>
<p>Global Pressure. In today’s global economy, Japanese car manufacturers are importing parts and components at growing rates, forcing the country’s parts suppliers to diversify their product offerings to compete with suppliers abroad. This has resulted in an increase of imports and exports of automotive related goods.</p>
