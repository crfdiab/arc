<h2 id=what-plants-can-grow-in-ireland>What plants can grow in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Old-fashiopned favourites such as Catmint (Nepeta), Bergamot (Monarda), Geraniums, Asters, Paeonies and Roses are just some of the many reliable and hardy plants that can withstand the worst of the weather. It’s worth bearing in mind the soil type too – most plants prefer free-draining soil.</p>
<h2 id=is-weeping-willow-native-to-ireland>Is weeping willow native to Ireland?</h2>
<p>Salix spp. There are several varieties of willow native to Ireland. All grow in damp soil, have catkins or ‘pussy willows’ that produce seeds, but are most easily grown from cuttings, which root very readily.</p>
<h2 id=what-vegetation-is-native-to-ireland>What vegetation is native to Ireland?</h2>
<p>Today the bulk of Ireland’s semi-natural vegetation is made up of three major habitats: Grassland, Heath and Bog.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-flora-of-ireland>What is the flora of Ireland?</h2>
<p>There are approximately 2,000 vascular plant species (ferns, clubmosses, flowering plants and conifers), over 800 bryophytes (mosses, liverworts and hornworths), 1,600 types of algae, about 1,000 different types of lichens and over 3,500 different species of fungi in the country.</p>
<h2 id=what-fruit-grows-best-in-ireland>What fruit grows best in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Raspberries. The most popular cane fruit crop grown in Ireland is the raspberry. They are mainly grown under protective cover. Use of different varieties and methods has extended the harvest from May to November.</p>
<h2 id=what-flowers-grow-all-year-round>What flowers grow all year round?</h2>
<p>Fall favorites for all-season flower gardens include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asters.</li>
<li>Ornamental grasses.</li>
<li>Mums.</li>
<li>Hardy begonias.</li>
<li>Ornamental kale.</li>
<li>Flowering cabbage.</li>
<li>Pansy.</li>
<li>Sedum.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-are-there-no-trees-in-ireland>Why are there no trees in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Ireland was left with very few native tree species following the Ice Age and a changing climate. Over the centuries, Ireland experienced a near-total destruction of its forests mainly because of human activity and a deterioration of the climate: from an initial forest cover of around 80% to less than 1%.</p>
<h2 id=is-copper-beech-native-to-ireland>Is Copper Beech native to Ireland?</h2>
<p>IT MAY surprise some to learn that the beech (Fagus sylvatica) is not a native Irish tree. Its appeal lies in the tree’s diversity, coupled with its ability to somehow hang on to to much of its autumn/winter foliage when others lose theirs.</p>
<h2 id=what-habitats-are-in-ireland>What habitats are in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Irish farmland is characterised by having a good diversity of habitats such as hedgerows, field margins, ponds and streams, native woodland, bogs and species-rich meadows and pastures.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-easiest-fruit-to-grow>What’s the easiest fruit to grow?</h2>
<p>Top ten easy to grow fruit trees and plants</p>
<ul>
<li>Strawberries. Everybody loves the fresh, juicy flavour of sun warmed strawberries picked straight from the garden.</li>
<li>Raspberries.</li>
<li>Blueberries.</li>
<li>Figs.</li>
<li>Gooseberries.</li>
<li>Apples.</li>
<li>Blackberries.</li>
<li>Honeyberries.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-plant-to-plant-in-ireland>Which is the best plant to plant in Ireland?</h2>
<p>When choosing the right plants for your garden the first choice should always be a native plant. Native Irish plants offer so much to gardeners and require far less time or care than other ‘divas’ of the garden.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-native-plants-in-ireland>Why are there so many native plants in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Native Irish plants offer so much to gardeners and require far less time or care than other ‘divas’ of the garden. There is a wide selection of native plants to choose from and many have interesting colour and features that brighten up and add colour to your garden throughout the year.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-fruit-and-vegetables-grown-in-ireland>Are there any fruit and vegetables grown in Ireland?</h2>
<p>However, it does give consumers an idea of what can be grown in Ireland and what to look out for with an Irish label in the supermarket. From now on, plenty of Irish fruit and vegetables will be available in shops and the season so far has been tough for many growers due to drought conditions on farms.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-of-a-garden-do-you-need-in-ireland>How big of a garden do you need in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Below is a list of some highly recommended native plants for Irish Gardens: Mature size: Around 2.5m</p>
