<h2 id=what-are-the-two-forts-in-puerto-rico>What are the two forts in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>Anyone interested in history but especially those interested in military history should take the time to explore Old San Juan’s two historic forts. Spanning decades of construction, both Castillo San Felipe del Morro and Castillo de San Cristóbal are open for the public to freely wander.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-old-san-juan-fort-built>When was the old San Juan fort built?</h2>
<p>1634<br>
Construction on the fort began in 1634 and took over a century to complete. Constructed to fortify Spain’s defense of Old San Juan’s harbor, the fort protected the island from land attacks.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-to-build-el-morro>How long did it take to build El Morro?</h2>
<p>The whole thing – huge city walls, San Cristobal fort for land attacks, and the El Morro enlargement – took about 150 years to complete. El Morro now had six levels of defense and rose 145 feet above sea level.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-famous-plaza-in-old-san-juan>What is the most famous plaza in Old San Juan?</h2>
<p>Plaza de Armas<br>
One of Old San Juan’s most emblematic plaza, Plaza de Armas, dates back to Spanish colonial times when it was designed as the city’s main town square. To one side of the plaza, you’ll find San Juan’s official town hall building and on another the Puerto Rico Department of State.</p>
<h2 id=what-religion-is-most-practiced-in-puerto-rico>What religion is most practiced in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>Puerto Ricans are overwhelmingly Christian. A majority (56%) of Puerto Ricans living on the island identified as Catholic in a 2014 Pew Research Center survey of religion in Latin America. And 33% identified as Protestants, among whom roughly half (48%) also identified as born-again Christians.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-rats-in-puerto-rico>Are there rats in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>Puerto Rico currently has 3 invasive rodent species: Black Rats, Norway Rats, and House Mice. At the time of non-native rodent introductions in the 1500s, there was at least 1 native rat species in Puerto Rico: Heteropsomys insulans Anthony (Insular Cave Rat or Spiny Rat).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-importance-of-the-forts-in-puerto-rico>What was the importance of the forts in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>Forts Forts El Morro and San Cristóbal along with 2.5 miles of city wall complete a fortification system that protected Puerto Rico, San Juan harbor and much of Spain’s interests in the “New World” from pirates and foreign invasion.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-fort-san-cristobal-in-puerto-rico>Where was the Fort San Cristobal in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>Location of Castillo San Cristóbal in Puerto Rico. Castillo San Cristóbal, also known as Fort San Cristóbal, is a fort in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It was built by Spain to protect against land based attacks on the city of San Juan.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-el-morro-fort-in-san-juan-built>Why was the El Morro fort in San Juan built?</h2>
<p>Get more info here Located on the headland overlooking the entrance to San Juan Bay, El Morro Fort (Castillo San Felipe del Morro) was built to protect the city of San Juan from seaborne enemies. For those of you arriving by sea today, you can see just why this imposing fortress commanded the respect of those that attempted to defeat it.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-spanish-build-the-san-juan-fort>When did the Spanish build the San Juan Fort?</h2>
<p>Spanish troops built forts in San Juan beginning in 1539 with a tower at El Morro and La Fortaleza. Most of the walls we see in the forts today were added later, in a period of tremendous construction from the 1760’s-1780’s. What does the name “El Morro” mean? This term means promontory or headland. It can also mean the forehead.</p>
