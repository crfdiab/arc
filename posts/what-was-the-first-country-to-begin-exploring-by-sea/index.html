<h2 id=what-was-the-first-country-to-begin-exploring-by-sea>What was the first country to begin exploring by sea?</h2>
<p>Henry the Navigator, prince of Portugal, initiated the first great enterprise of the Age of Discovery—the search for a sea route east by south to Cathay. His motives were mixed.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-spain-start-exploring>When did Spain start exploring?</h2>
<p>1492<br>
Beginning in 1492 with the first voyage of Christopher Columbus (1451?-1506), Spanish explorers and conquistadors built a colonial empire that turned Spain into one of the great European powers.</p>

<h2 id=where-did-exploration-take-place-in-the-16th-century>Where did exploration take place in the 16th century?</h2>
<p>Exploration increasingly left the water and entered the land, resulting in invasions and colonizations throughout the Americas. Northern European countries and Russia became involved in world exploration in the latter part of the 16th century further exploring North America, Siberia, New Zealand, and Australia.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-of-the-ocean-has-never-been-explored>How much of the ocean has never been explored?</h2>
<p>More than 80 percent of the ocean has never been mapped, explored, or even seen by humans. A far greater percentage of the surfaces of the moon and the planet Mars have been mapped and studied than our own ocean floor has. Although there is much more to learn, oceanographers have already made some amazing discoveries.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-explorers-discover-the-pacific-ocean>How did the explorers discover the Pacific Ocean?</h2>
<p>Explorers began to learn significantly more about these new lands and by 1513, the Pacific Ocean was reached by crossing the Isthmus of Panama. Discovering that the Pacific Ocean is located on the other side of the New World led to a renewed desire to explore.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-national-geographic-explorer-of-the-ocean>Who is the National Geographic Explorer of the ocean?</h2>
<p>Learning more about the seafloor and the rest of the ocean is the passion of National Geographic Explorer Marcello Calisti. He is a biorobotics expert who is developing an undersea exploration vehicle that uses “legged locomotion,” inspired by the way an octopus moves under water.</p>
