<h2 id=where-are-the-safaris-in-tanzania>Where are the safaris in Tanzania?</h2>

<h2 id=why-are-tanzania-safaris-so-expensive>Why are Tanzania safaris so expensive?</h2>
<p>Re: Why are safari lodgings so expensive? Both companies you are looking at are American companies, they subcontract with local companies as they most probably are not licensed to operate in Tanzania, thus cannot take clients into the parks. This adds to the cost substantially.</p>
<h2 id=is-kenya-or-tanzania-safari-better>Is Kenya or Tanzania safari better?</h2>
<p>So in general, Tanzania is more affordable while Kenya has a better travel infrastructure. Kenya has the larger tourism infrastructure and has more lodges to accommodate globetrotters heading on an African safari, so the cost of a safari in Kenya will likely be less than one in Tanzania.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-time-for-safari-in-tanzania>What is the best time for safari in Tanzania?</h2>
<p>The best time to visit Tanzania is from July to October when the country is at its driest. This coincides with the migration river crossings, however, all the parks offer amazing wildlife sightings at this time as the grasses and bush are at their least dense.</p>

<h2 id=which-country-is-best-for-safari>Which country is best for safari?</h2>
<p>Kenya is the original safari country. It maintains its rank among the best wildlife viewing countries today, offering the classic safari experience. The Masai Mara Game Reserve remains the most prolific area for big cat viewing, and arguably the best game viewing overall.</p>
