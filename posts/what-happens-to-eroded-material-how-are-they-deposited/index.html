<h2 id=what-happens-to-eroded-material-how-are-they-deposited>What happens to eroded material How are they deposited?</h2>
<p>When the velocity of wind or water slows, eroded sediment is deposited in a new location. The sediment builds up in a process called sedimentation and creates fertile land.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-something-is-eroded>What happens when something is eroded?</h2>
<p>Erosion is the geological process in which earthen materials are worn away and transported by natural forces such as wind or water. A similar process, weathering, breaks down or dissolves rock, but does not involve movement. If the wind is dusty, or water or glacial ice is muddy, erosion is taking place.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-earth-materials-during-erosion>What happens to earth materials during erosion?</h2>
<p>Erosion is distinct from weathering, in which chemical and physical processes simply break down larger pieces of rock into smaller ones. In erosion, the portions of Earth affected are moved from their original location by forces exerted by gravity, wind, flowing water or some combination.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-dropping-of-eroded-material>What is the dropping of eroded material?</h2>
<p>The movement of sediments by wind, water, ice, or gravity is called erosion. Sediments are dropped in a new location. The process of dropping sediments in a new location is called deposition. Some of the small pieces are deposited on the ocean floor.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-erosion-different-from-other-natural-processes>How is erosion different from other natural processes?</h2>
<p>Processes of erosion that produce sediment or solutes from a place contrast with those of deposition, which control the arrival and emplacement of material at a new location. While erosion is a natural process, human activities have increased by 10-40 times the rate at which erosion is occurring globally.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-thermal-erosion-related-to-permafrost-melting>How is thermal erosion related to permafrost melting?</h2>
<p>Thermal erosion is the result of melting and weakening permafrost due to moving water. It can occur both along rivers and at the coast. Rapid river channel migration observed in the Lena River of Siberia is due to thermal erosion, as these portions of the banks are composed of permafrost-cemented non-cohesive materials.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-human-activities-affecting-the-rate-of-erosion>How are human activities affecting the rate of erosion?</h2>
<p>The transport of eroded materials from their original location is followed by deposition, which is arrival and emplacement of material at a new location. While erosion is a natural process, human activities have increased by 10-40 times the rate at which erosion is occurring globally.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-erosion-take-place-what-happens-to-the-sediment>When does erosion take place what happens to the sediment?</h2>
