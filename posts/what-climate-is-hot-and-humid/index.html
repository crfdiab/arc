<h2 id=what-climate-is-hot-and-humid>What climate is hot and humid?</h2>
<p>A humid subtropical climate is a zone of climate characterized by hot and humid summers, and cool to mild winters. These climates normally lie on the southeast side of all continents, generally between latitudes 25° and 40° (sometimes 45°) and are located poleward from adjacent tropical climates.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-philippines-very-humid>Is the Philippines very humid?</h2>
<p>Humidity and Wind the Philippines has some very humid months, and high humidity throughout the year. The least humid month is April (72.6% relative humidity), and the most humid month is September (80.3%). Wind in the Philippines is usually calm.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-philippines-so-hot>Why is the Philippines so hot?</h2>
<p>Humidity. Relative humidity is high in the Philippines. A high amount of moisture or vapor in the air makes hot temperatures feel hotter. The first may be considered as general causes of the great humidity, which is generally observed in all the islands throughout the year.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-climate-does-the-philippines-have>What kind of climate does the Philippines have?</h2>
<p>The Philippines has five types of climates: tropical rainforest, tropical monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical and oceanic (both are in higher-altitude areas) characterized by relatively high temperature, oppressive humidity and plenty of rainfall. There are two seasons in the country, the wet season and the dry season.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-most-humid-month-in-the-philippines>When is the most humid month in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>The mean monthly relative humidity over the year in Manila (Luzon), Philippines. * Data from weather station: Manila, Philippines. On average, September is the most humid. On average, April is the least humid month.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-rainy-season-in-manila-philippines>When is the rainy season in Manila Philippines?</h2>
<p>As June begins, the rainfall in Manila begins to escalate, peaking in August with an average rainfall of 18.8 inches and 22 average rainfall days. Humidity, too, crests at 83 percent on that month. Rainy season (also known as the monsoon season) is as low as low season can go, with no festivals and very few tourists visiting at that time of year.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-so-hot-in-the-philippines-during-summer>Why is it so hot in the Philippines during summer?</h2>
<p>Because Philippines is one of those countries which are located near the equator, where the sun rays directly hit. From March to June, you can expect hot and dry weather. May is the hottest month of the year.</p>
