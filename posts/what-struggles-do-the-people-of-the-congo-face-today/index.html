<h2 id=what-struggles-do-the-people-of-the-congo-face-today>What struggles do the people of the Congo face today?</h2>
<p>Decades of war, violence, and poverty have claimed the lives of over five million people. An absence of schools, health care, and reliable income-generating opportunities hinder communities’ ability to emerge from crisis. Despite overwhelming odds, there is hope across eastern Congo today.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-in-the-congo-crisis>What happened in the Congo crisis?</h2>
<p>Constituting a series of civil wars, the Congo Crisis was also a proxy conflict in the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union and the United States supported opposing factions. The involvement of the Soviets split the Congolese government and led to an impasse between Lumumba and President Joseph Kasa-Vubu.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-still-conflict-in-congo>Is there still conflict in Congo?</h2>
<p>Although a peace agreement was signed in 2002, violence has continued in many regions of the country, especially in the east. Hostilities have continued since the ongoing Lord’s Resistance Army insurgency, and the Kivu and Ituri conflicts.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-i-do-to-help-congo>What can I do to help Congo?</h2>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-challenges-did-african-states-face>What kind of challenges did African states face?</h2>
<p>When African states gained their independence from Europe’s colonial empires, they faced numerous challenges starting with their lack of infrastructure. Below are challenges faced by African states at independence. One of the most pressing challenges African states faced at Independence was their lack of infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-problems-in-the-congo-river-basin>What are the problems in the Congo River basin?</h2>
<p>With human populations growing at 2% to 3% and subsistence agriculture still the main source of food and income for most people in the Congo River Basin, habitat loss, bushmeat trade and climate change are likely to be the most significant long-term threats to biodiversity.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-congo-face-after-winning-its-independence>What did the Congo face after winning its independence?</h2>
<p>The Belgians left quite abruptly without putting any transitional structures in place to help the Congo transition to independence after seventy-five years of colonial rule. This power vacuum at the national level meant that most rule was left to local tribal leaders, who often held old rivalries and conflicting agendas.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-no-economic-development-in-congo>Why was there no economic development in Congo?</h2>
<p>During the reign of the Belgians in Congo, no viable economic development was initiated. Little development was done in infrastructure in order to facilitate transportation of raw materials to the ports of Matadi etc. At independence, the country was faced with the problems of shortage of manpower, skills and entrepreneurship.</p>
