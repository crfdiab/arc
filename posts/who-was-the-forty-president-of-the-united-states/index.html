<h2 id=how-many-of-the-45-us-presidents-have-been>How many of the 45 US presidents have been?</h2>
<p>By the numbers. There have been 46 presidencies (including the current one, Joe Biden, whose term began in 2021), and 45 different individuals have served as president. Grover Cleveland was elected to two nonconsecutive terms, and as such is considered the 22nd and 24th president of the United States.</p>
<h2 id=which-presidents-have-the-same-last-name>Which presidents have the same last name?</h2>
<p>Five pairs of presidents have shared the same last name — Adams, Harrison, Johnson, Roosevelt and Bush. Only the Johnsons were not related to each other.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-presidents-of-the-united-states-of-america>Who are the presidents of the United States of America?</h2>
<p>1 George Washington (1789 – 1797). 2 John Adams (1797 – 1801). 3 Thomas Jefferson (1801 – 1809). 4 James Madison (1809 – 1817). 5 James Monroe (1817 – 1825). 6 John Quincy Adams (1825 – 1829). 7 Andrew Jackson (1829 – 1837). 8 Martin Van Buren (1837 – 1841). 9 William H. Harrison (1841). 10 John Tyler (1841 – 1845).</p>
<h2 id=are-there-more-stories-about-our-forty-four-presidents>Are there more stories about our forty-four presidents?</h2>
<p>But surely there’s still more to Washington than what’s been fed to us in books and by politicians, surely his dark moments held him back as much as his shining moments carried him forward … We’re only a short while away from the next election.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-46th-president-of-the-united-states-of-america>Who is the 46th President of the United States of America?</h2>
<p>Joseph R. Biden Jr is the 46th President of the United States of America. However, only 45 men have served as president. This is because presidents are numbered by their continuous terms in office. Grover Cleveland, who won two non-consecutive terms in 1884 and 1892, is therefore the 22nd and 24th president.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-44-writers-or-44-presidents-in-history>Are there 44 writers or 44 presidents in history?</h2>
<p>44 presidents, 44 writers, 44 stories. Part 9: Dude, Where’s My Country? Kevin Murphy is the digital media marketing manager of Melville House.</p>
