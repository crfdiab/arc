<h2 id=what-games-did-people-play-in-the-tudor-times>What games did people play in the Tudor times?</h2>
<p>The Tudors enjoyed playing card and dice games, and they played a number of board games, such as chess, a version of backgammon called ‘Squares’, Fox and Geese (sometimes called Fox and Hound) and a version of draughts.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-popular-sport-in-the-1500s>What was the most popular sport in the 1500s?</h2>
<p>In the early 1500s football became a popular sport in England. It was a very different game from the one played today. All kinds of sports were very popular in the Sixteenth Century.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-popular-in-tudor-times>What was popular in Tudor times?</h2>
<p>Henry VII’s favorite pastimes were chess, cards and dicing, and shooting the butts. (When he did play tennis, Henry VII usually lost – at that time, tennis was called ‘tenes. ‘) Tennis was not played as it is today – in Tudor times, it was on a covered court.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-games-were-played-in-tudor-times>What kind of games were played in Tudor times?</h2>
<p>Port and King was another game played in Tudor times. It was a variant of ground billiards (an outdoor croquet-type game) and was played on a green cloth table, a case of bringing a favourite game inside so that it could be enjoyed all year round.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-games-did-children-play-in-medieval-times>What kind of games did children play in medieval times?</h2>
<p>Chess was only played by the rich and well educated. Out in the street, children made up their own games and entertainments. They chased spinning wooden hoops and played leapfrog, catch, and bowls. They also played the then extremely violent game of football.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-game-called-in-the-16th-century>What was the game called in the 16th century?</h2>
<p>The rules of dozens of dice games played in the 16th century were not dissimilar to those of the modern card-game pontoon. A game was called a ‘main’. The players laid their stake in the pool, then rolled two or three dice as many times as they chose, totting up the score and aiming to be as close as possible to 31.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-games-do-people-still-play>What kind of games do people still play?</h2>
<p>The answer is board games – some of which we still play to similar rules today, and some that have been adapted over time.</p>
