<h2 id=how-did-the-revolutionary-war-affect-the-articles-of-confederation>How did the Revolutionary War affect the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>The American Revolution and the Articles of Confederation. Shay’s Rebellion showed the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. When the central government couldn’t put down the rebellion, the first stirrings of federalism began to gather strength.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-revolutionary-war-against-england>What was the result of the Revolutionary War against England?</h2>
<p>The Americans in the Thirteen Colonies defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern constitutional liberal democracy.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-articles-of-confederation-affect-the-united-states>How did the Articles of Confederation affect the United States?</h2>
<p>The Articles of Confederation comprised the United States’ first constitution, lasting from 1776 until 1789. The Articles established a weak central government and placed most powers in the hands of the states. Under the Articles, the US economy faltered, since the central government lacked the power to enforce tax laws or regulate commerce.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-weakness-of-the-articles-of-confederation>What was the weakness of the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>If state governors chose not to honor the national government’s request, the country would lack an adequate defense. The weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation became apparent to all as a result of an uprising of Massachusetts farmers known as Shays’s Rebellion.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-articles-of-confederation-replaced-by-the-us-constitution>When was the Articles of Confederation replaced by the US Constitution?</h2>
<p>First constitution for the United States; replaced by the current United States Constitution on March 4, 1789. The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union was an agreement among the 13 original states of the United States of America that served as its first constitution.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-articles-of-confederation-have-trouble-borrowing-money>Why did the Articles of Confederation have trouble borrowing money?</h2>
<p>The Confederation had trouble borrowing needed money overseas, because it didn’t have any taxation power to make it creditworthy, Randall says. Worse yet, the states, which were functioning in some ways as if they were separate countries, started hitting one another with tariffs.</p>
