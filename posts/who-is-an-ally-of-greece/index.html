<h2 id=who-is-an-ally-of-greece>Who is an ally of Greece?</h2>
<p>Its main allies are the United States, France, Italy, Bulgaria, the other NATO countries, Cyprus and the rest of the European Union.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-spartas-biggest-ally>Who was Sparta’s biggest ally?</h2>
<p>Sparta was leader of an alliance of independent states that included most of the major land powers of the Peloponnese and central Greece, as well as the sea power Corinth. Thus, the Athenians had the stronger navy and the Spartans the stronger army.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-to-blame-for-the-peloponnesian-war>Who is to blame for the Peloponnesian War?</h2>
<p>The primary causes were that Sparta feared the growing power and influence of the Athenian Empire. The Peloponnesian war began after the Persian Wars ended in 449 BCE. The two powers struggled to agree on their respective spheres of influence, absent Persia’s influence.</p>
<h2 id=who-supported-athens-in-the-peloponnesian-war>Who supported Athens in the Peloponnesian War?</h2>
<p>The Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought between the Delian League, led by Athens, and the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-sparta-declare-war-on-athens>Why did Sparta declare war on Athens?</h2>
<p>When Sparta declared war, it announced that it wanted to liberate Greece from Athenian oppression. And with some justification, because Athens had converted the Delian League, which had once been meant as a defensive alliance against the Persian Empire, into an Athenian empire.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-allies-and-enemies-of-athena>Who are the Allies and enemies of Athena?</h2>
<p>Among Athena’s allies were many heroes of Greek mythology, including Odysseus, Jason, Perseus and Heracles. Because she sided with the Greeks in the Trojan War, her enemies included Paris and the other defenders of Troy.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-main-allies-of-the-greek-government>Who are the main allies of the Greek government?</h2>
<p>Its main allies are the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the other NATO countries, and the European Union .</p>
<h2 id=who-was-spartas-ally-in-the-peloponnesian-league>Who was Sparta’s ally in the Peloponnesian League?</h2>
<p>During the existence of the Peloponnesian League (c. 505 to 365 BCE), Sparta formed an alliance with Elis, Tegea, Corinth, and other states. By joining this alliance system, the other states said that they would maintain the same allies and rivals as Sparta, and they provided troops to Sparta.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-relations-between-algeria-and-greece>What are the relations between Algeria and Greece?</h2>
<p>Relations between the two countries have been traditionally friendly since Algeria’s first years of independence. Algeria is represented in Greece by its embassy in Athens. Both countries are members of the Union for the Mediterranean.</p>
