<h2 id=who-is-the-royal-family-of-switzerland>Who is the royal family of Switzerland?</h2>
<p>The main members of the royal family are King Carl XVI Gustaf, Queen Silvia and their children with families. The King and Queen have three children, the first-born being Crown Princess Victoria Ingrid Alice Désirée, Duchess of Västergötland, born on 14 July 1977.</p>
<h2 id=who-ruled-switzerland-before-1848>Who Ruled Switzerland before 1848?</h2>
<p>Originally inhabited by the Helvetians, or Helvetic Celts, the territory comprising modern Switzerland came under Roman rule during the Gallic wars in the 1st century BC and remained a Roman province until the 4th century AD.</p>
<h2 id=did-switzerland-ever-have-a-royal-family>Did Switzerland ever have a royal family?</h2>
<p>Switzerland has been republic since 1848. There’s no king. Switzerland started with three royal families. The strongest and largest family, Schwyz (Switzer), came to power on August 1, 1291.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-ruler-of-switzerland-during-the-holy-roman-empire>Who was the ruler of Switzerland during the Holy Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>In Switzerland, there was a great number of families of dynasties who were members of the Holy Roman Empire. Other cantons had rulers from the House of Savoy, or from the ruling dynasty of the Kingdom of Burgundy. This diversity prevented the birth of a state with monarchical central authority.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-swedish-monarch-lose-his-power>When did the Swedish monarch lose his power?</h2>
<p>The Constitution of 1809 assumed that the monarch would appoint his Cabinet as he saw fit, but growing calls for democratisation during the end of the 19th century made such an idea impossible to sustain. 1917 marks the end of any real political power for the Swedish monarch.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-privileges-of-the-nobility-end-in-switzerland>When did the privileges of the nobility end in Switzerland?</h2>
<p>The privileges of the nobility were gradually suspended after 1798, save for a revival in Lucerne and Freiburg during the Restauration from 1814 to 1831. Article 4 on equality of the 1848 Swiss federal constitution, finally made a legal end to the Swiss nobility.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-monasteries-in-switzerland>What was the role of monasteries in Switzerland?</h2>
<p>Feudal system. Monasteries keep up roman and greek heritage (reading and writing) and develop new agricultural methods. Three valleys in Central Switzerland unite against the counts of Habsburg and fight for autonomy. Cities join the confederacy. They conquer territories in northern and southern Switzerland.</p>
