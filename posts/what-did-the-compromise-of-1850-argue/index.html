<h2 id=what-did-the-compromise-of-1850-argue>What did the Compromise of 1850 argue?</h2>
<p>It admitted California as a free state, left Utah and New Mexico to decide for themselves whether to be a slave state or a free state, defined a new Texas-New Mexico boundary, and made it easier for slaveowners to recover runways under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-during-the-debate-over-the-compromise-of-1850>What happened during the debate over the Compromise of 1850?</h2>
<p>As part of the Compromise of 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was amended and the slave trade in Washington, D.C., was abolished. Furthermore, California entered the Union as a free state and a territorial government was created in Utah.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-united-states-agree-to-the-compromise-of-1850>Why did the United States agree to the Compromise of 1850?</h2>
<p>Compromise of 1850, in U.S. history, a series of measures proposed by the “great compromiser,” Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky, and passed by the U.S. Congress in an effort to settle several outstanding slavery issues and to avert the threat of dissolution of the Union.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-south-not-like-the-compromise-of-1850>Why did the South not like the Compromise of 1850?</h2>
<p>People in both the North and the South didn’t like parts of the Compromise of 1850. The Compromise of 1850 allowed people to decide if land in the Utah and New Mexico territories would be able to have slavery. This meant several new states could possibly join the Union as slave states if people wanted that to occur.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-issue-in-the-1850s-in-the-united-states>What was the issue in the 1850s in the United States?</h2>
<p>The 1850s was a pivotal decade in the 19th century. In the United States, tensions over slavery became prominent and events began to put the nation on the road to civil war. In Europe, new technology was celebrated and the great powers fought the Crimean War.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-compromise-of-1850>What was the purpose of the Compromise of 1850?</h2>
<p>The Compromise of 1850 was a package of five separate bills passed by the United States Congress in September 1850 that defused a political confrontation between slave and free states on the status of territories acquired in the Mexican–American War.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-debate-over-slavery-in-the-united-states>What was the debate over slavery in the United States?</h2>
<p>This push to expand slavery into new territories led to some of the most important political battles in U.S. history. By the second decade of the nineteenth century, the political debate over slavery was becoming increasingly divisive and contentious. Congress heatedly debated whether or not slavery should be extended into the territories.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-time-period-from-1850-to-1860>What was the time period from 1850 to 1860?</h2>
<p>Historic Timeline From 1850 to 1860 The dynamic decade of the 1850s was marked by controversy over slavery in the United States, the Crimean War fought between Russian and European powers, and the rapid growth of steam-power travel on water and land.</p>
