<p>“Patriots,” as they came to be known, were members of the 13 British colonies who rebelled against British control during the American Revolution, supporting instead the U.S. Continental Congress.</p>
<h2 id=at-what-battle-were-the-american-soldiers-told-dont-fire-until-you-see-the-whites-of-their-eyes>At what battle were the American soldiers told don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes?</h2>
<p>Cultural definitions for Don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes (2 of 2) A famous command attributed to William Prescott, an American officer, at the Battle of Bunker Hill in the Revolutionary War. Prescott may have said “color” rather than “whites.”</p>

<p>In comparing the two revolutions, it becomes clear there is a fundamental differences in the way frustration with authority manifested itself. As a result, the American Revolution was able to succeed where the French Revolution failed.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-american-revolution-so-unique-in-history>What makes the American Revolution so unique in history?</h2>
<p>Whatever group won the first revolution became the enemy of the next revolution, and the cycle continued on and on. What made the American Revolution so unique was that the Founding Fathers didn’t actually consider it to be a revolution.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-revolutionary-war-fought-in-north-america>Why was the Revolutionary War fought in North America?</h2>
<p>That war, which had been fought in North America, left Great Britain with a huge debt that had to be paid. Parliament said it had fought the long and costly war to protect its American subjects from the powerful French in Canada. Parliament said it was right to tax the American colonists to help pay the bills for the war. Most Americans disagreed.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-americans-were-for-or-against-the-american-revolution>How many Americans were for or against the American Revolution?</h2>
<p>The most common piece of evidence cited in numerous books about the Revolution is a letter of John Adams indicating that one third of the Americans were for the Revolution, another third were against it, and a final third were neutral or indifferent to the whole affair.</p>
