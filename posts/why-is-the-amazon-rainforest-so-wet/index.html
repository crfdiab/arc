<h2 id=why-is-the-amazon-rainforest-so-wet>Why is the Amazon rainforest so wet?</h2>
<p>Scientists have known for some time that transpiration—the process by which plants and trees release moisture to the atmosphere—contributes much of the water that falls back down on the Amazon rainforest in its “wet season.” But that moisture led to a chicken-or-egg question: does transpiration amplify the rainy season …</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-amazon-rainforest-important-to-brazil>Why is the Amazon rainforest important to Brazil?</h2>
<p>The world’s largest rainforest affects the global climate, and its diversity of plants and animals is without equal. The rainforest contributes about $8.2 billion a year to Brazil’s economy from products including rubber and timber.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-brazil-have-the-most-rainforests>Why does Brazil have the most rainforests?</h2>
<p>Most of the rainforest areas in Brazil are concentrated within the Amazon Basin, which is particularly humid, with year-round precipitation, making for the ideal ‘jungle’ environment. Agriculture – replacing the rainforest vegetation with grass for cattle and crops for human consumption.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-amazon-rainforest-the-wettest-place-on-earth>Is the Amazon rainforest the wettest place on earth?</h2>
<p>The Amazon rainforest is one of the wettest places on earth. Annual rainfall averages out at around 7.5 feet, but two towns in Colombia – Lloro and Lopez del Micay, with annual averages of around 42 feet – claim to be the world’s wettest and second wettest towns.</p>
<h2 id=are-rainforests-hot-or-cold>Are rainforests hot or cold?</h2>
<p>Tropical rainforests are lush and warm all year long! Temperatures don’t even change much between night and day. The average temperature in tropical rainforests ranges from 70 to 85°F (21 to 30°C). The environment is pretty wet in tropical rainforests, maintaining a high humidity of 77% to 88% year-round.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-rainforest-so-hot>Why is the rainforest so hot?</h2>
<p>Why are tropica rainforest so hot and wet? Because it is on the equator the suns rays will always be directly shining on them. Rainforests are wet because the air pressure at the equator is low. Air is sucked in from the oceans which contains moisture.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-amazon-in-danger>Is the Amazon in danger?</h2>
<p>The Amazon is still the most extensive rainforest on earth, but a disastrously large part of it is now in danger of disappearing for good. The forest produces more than 50 percent of all the rain that falls in the Amazon region, and it probably affects rainfall patterns far outside South America.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-brazilian-amazon-rainforest-a-wild-place>Is the Brazilian Amazon rainforest a wild place?</h2>
<p>When we think of wild places, the Brazilian Amazon is often one of the first locations that come to mind. This verdant swath of rainforest is a unique world unto its own – a place where rare animals roam and indigenous tribes still live according to the ways of their ancestors.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-interesting-facts-about-the-amazon-rainforest>What are some interesting facts about the Amazon rainforest?</h2>
<p>So when the facts start to fly regarding this amazing ecosystem, the Brazilian Amazon is nearly always a large part of the conversation. These statistics are full of superlatives, oddities, and other wondrous elements. 1. Around 6% of the Earth’s surface is covered in tropical rainforest, and the Amazon rainforest is the world’s largest.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-dangerous-to-visit-the-amazon-rainforest>Why is it dangerous to visit the Amazon rainforest?</h2>
<p>This is for several reasons: 1. There is a perceived danger of the dangerous human elements (drug lords, and so on) in and around the Amazon. This is not quite as risky as some foreigners believe, and formal tour groups should provide sufficient protection against any potential risk. Green tones of the Brazilian Amazon,the tropical rainforest. 2.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-amazon-rainforest-helping-the-brazilian-economy>How is the Amazon rainforest helping the Brazilian economy?</h2>
<p>For example, Brazilian cattle ranching is currently very low-yield. Intensifying cattle ranching could help meet increased demand, without jeopardizing the Amazon further. Sustainable aquaculture of native Amazonian fish is another economic alternative that shows promise.</p>
