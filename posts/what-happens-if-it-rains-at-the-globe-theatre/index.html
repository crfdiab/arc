<h2 id=what-happens-if-it-rains-at-the-globe-theatre>What happens if it rains at the Globe Theatre?</h2>
<p>If it rains, people on the floor (standing) get wet, and people in the benches won’t cuz they are under roof. over a year ago. over a year ago. There’s covered seating and there’s the open standing only area in front of the stage.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-a-groundling>What was life like for a Groundling?</h2>
<p>They were too poor to pay to be able to sit on one of the three levels of the theatre. If they paid one penny (equivalent to £1 in 2019), they could stand in “the pit”, also called “the yard”, just below the stage, to watch the play. Standing in the pit was uncomfortable, and people were usually packed in tightly.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-it-like-to-be-a-groundling-in-the-globe-theatre>What was it like to be a Groundling in the Globe Theatre?</h2>
<p>Elizabethan general public or people who were not nobility were referred to as groundlings. They would pay one penny to stand in the Pit of the Globe Theater (Howard 75). The upper class spectators would pay to sit in the galleries often using cushions for comfort.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-groundlings-when-it-rained>What happened to the Groundlings when it rained?</h2>
<p>why is the globe theatre famous? why did the groundlings get wet if it rained? it was roughly circular in shape. the roof did not cover the whole theatre so the pit or yard in the middle of the theatre was open to the sky.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-ticket-at-the-globe-theatre>How much is a ticket at the Globe theatre?</h2>
<p>Tickets for a tour of the theater cost £17 for adults, £15.50 for visitors aged 60 and over, £13.50 for students aged 16 and over, and £10 for children.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-take-food-into-the-globe-theatre>Can you take food into the globe theatre?</h2>
<p>You can bring the drinks and food into the audience, however rude it might seem. But especially on the yard it’s acceptable to watch the play with a pint of beer in your hand.</p>
<h2 id=at-what-age-may-a-boy-and-girl-marry-and-at-what-age-is-marriage-for-non-noble-families-common>At what age may a boy and girl marry and at what age is marriage for non noble families common?</h2>
<p>A boy may marry at age 14 and girls at 12, however it was recommended that boys not marry until they were 22 and girls not until they were 18. In a non-noble family it is common to marry at age 25-26 for men and 23 for women.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-elizabeth-do-to-make-sure-england-could-defend-themselves-from-foreign-attacks>What did Elizabeth do to make sure England could defend themselves from foreign attacks?</h2>
<p>What did Elizabeth do to make sure England could defend herself from foreign attacks? She encouraged the building and manning of ships to defend England in case of attack by foreign powers.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-elizabethan-actors-use-to-show-that-they-had-been-stabbed>What did Elizabethan actors use to show that they had been stabbed?</h2>
<p>For the most part, they used handkerchiefs soaked in animal blood to indicate a mortal wound. More ambitious troupes would fill a sheep or ox’s bladder with blood and hide it underneath the actor’s clothes so that when he got stabbed, it’d spurt blood everywhere.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-rain-water-on-the-ground>What happens to rain water on the ground?</h2>
<p>Light rain soaks into the soil, if the ground is covered with mulch or leaves or similar, the soil will retain some of the rain/moisture. Some rain will evaporate into the air. Heavy rains tend to run off into header streams, creeks & rivers, but some will soak into the ground & some will evaporate.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-okay-to-apply-pest-control-in-the-rain>Is it okay to apply pest control in the rain?</h2>
<p>You are not alone. When it starts to rain we often receive calls from our clients asking to reschedule for a sunnier day or wondering if it’s okay to apply products in the wet weather. Understandably, most people think pest control treatments will wash away with the rain or be less effective because it’s wet outside.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-outdoor-pesticides-when-it-rains>What happens to outdoor pesticides when it rains?</h2>
<p>Outdoor pesticide and insecticide treatments will be diluted and less effective after it rains. The amount that the insecticide and pesticide are diluted depends entirely on both the specific product and the amount of rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-put-on-your-lawn-when-it-rains>What do you put on your lawn when it rains?</h2>
<p>Lawn granule pellets are a form of pesticide that is placed onto your lawn and then activated by water to soak into the ground. Most pest control sprays, however, will become very diluted after a few heavy rainfalls.</p>
