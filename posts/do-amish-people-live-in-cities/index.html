<h2 id=do-amish-people-live-in-cities>Do Amish people live in cities?</h2>
<p>The Amish have traditionally lived in places like Lancaster County, Pennsylvania (population 26,270), or Holmes County, Ohio (population 17,654). Now,they are spreading to other parts of the country, from New York to Missouri and Wyoming. Montana now has four settlements, and Nebraska has three.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-amish-leave-the-community>Why do Amish leave the community?</h2>
<p>The Amish, a subsect of the Anabaptist Christian movement, intentionally segregate themselves from other communities as a part of their faith. For Amish youth, the Rumspringa normally begins around the ages of 14–16 and ends when a youth chooses either to be baptized in the Amish church or to leave the community.</p>
<h2 id=are-amish-allowed-to-use-electricity>Are Amish allowed to use electricity?</h2>
<p>In Lancaster County, the Amish population is OK with using electricity, but they reject the grid that brings it into most Americans’ homes. That’s because they want to maintain a separation from the wider world. The Amish believe this life on earth is part of their journey to heaven.</p>
<h2 id=can-an-outsider-become-amish>Can an outsider become Amish?</h2>
<p>“Can an outsider join the Amish church/community?” You can begin wherever you are.” Yes, it is possible for outsiders, through conversion and convincement, to join the Amish community, but we must quickly add that it seldom happens. First, the Amish do not evangelize and seek to add outsiders to their church.</p>
<h2 id=do-amish-have-bathrooms-in-their-house>Do Amish have bathrooms in their house?</h2>
<p>Most Amish homes are laid out in basically the same way. They have a large kitchen and combination dining area, a living room, and normally the parents’ bedroom on the main floor. Side rooms are attached for summer cooking use, and many had separate wash houses. There is no indoor plumbing or bathrooms.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-love-the-amish-so-much>Why do we love the Amish so much?</h2>
<p>We admire the Amish for their stubborn refusal to change and to adapt. We are amazed that they continue to live in this high-tech, always-on world in the way they do. Yet they live in it unabashed, unembarrassed by their eccentricities. They don’t allow external pressure to shape their deepest beliefs.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-rules-to-leaving-the-amish-community>Are there any rules to leaving the Amish community?</h2>
<p>The creepy rule that stops people from ever leaving the Amish community If you think leaving the Amish community must be easy. Think again. There’s a really creepy reason why most people stay. If you decide to leave, not only can you not come back most of the time, but you also have to cut all ties with your family and friends.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-amish-not-to-watch-tv>What does it mean to Amish not to watch TV?</h2>
<p>No TVs means no advertising and no immoral messages. The Amish also believe in hard work and usefulness. They would consider watching TV or surfing the internet a waste of time.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-name-of-the-amish-community-come-from>Where did the name of the Amish community come from?</h2>
<p>Jakob Amman was a devout Christian traditionalist from Switzerland, who believed that Christians should follow the teachings of Christ & the apostles at a more traditional level than some other members of the Church. From Jakob Ammans name was derived the word Amish.</p>
