<h2 id=why-did-norman-towns-grow>Why did Norman towns grow?</h2>
<p>Trade played an important role in the growth of towns during the Norman period. Trade links with France were strengthened at the expense of Scandinavians links, however the Normans brought stability in trade and this led to the development of many towns.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-normans-build-castles-in-towns>Why did the Normans build castles in towns?</h2>
<p>After their victory at the Battle of Hastings, the Normans settled in England. They constructed castles all over the country in order to control their newly-won territory, and to pacify the Anglo-Saxon population. These early castles were mainly of motte and bailey type.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-towns-like-at-the-time-of-the-domesday-book>What were towns like at the time of the Domesday Book?</h2>
<p>Life for the Domesday peasant was harsh. Peasant houses were made of wood, wattle and mud and needed frequent rebuilding. People shared a single large room with their animals for warmth in winter, and cooking was over an open fire. Clothes were made of wool, flax and animals skins.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-in-a-norman-town>What was in a Norman town?</h2>
<p>The purpose of a Norman town was primarily to colonise and control. The creation of a planned town provided an area in which the majority of ‘burgesses’ or residents of a borough were merchants and craftsmen, rather than farmers.</p>
<h2 id=what-stayed-the-same-after-the-norman-conquest>What stayed the same after the Norman Conquest?</h2>
<p>Although there were a lot of chamges after the Norman conquest in 1066, some parts of England stayed the same. Villagers grow their crops whether their Lord was Norman/Saxon. The Normans had the same cures and treatments. They kept how people farm the same.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-normans-speak-english>Did the Normans speak English?</h2>
<p>The Literate Language Although the first language of the Normans and their descendants shifted from Norman to Anglo-Norman to Middle English, many of them also spoke Latin with various levels of fluency.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-domesday-book-still-exist>Does the Domesday Book still exist?</h2>
<p>In 1859, they were placed in the new Public Record Office, London. They are now held at The National Archives at Kew. The chest in which they were stowed in the 17th and 18th centuries is also at Kew. In modern times, the books have been removed from the London area only rarely.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-domesday-book-reveal>What did the Domesday Book reveal?</h2>
<p>The Domesday Book provides extensive records of landholders, their tenants, the amount of land they owned, how many people occupied the land (villagers, smallholders, free men, slaves, etc.), the amounts of woodland, meadow, animals, fish and ploughs on the land (if there were any) and other resources, any buildings …</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-normans-do-for-fun>What did the Normans do for fun?</h2>
<p>In medieval times Normans had to make their own entertainment. Today inside we can have lots of fun with T.V. ‘s , games consoles, computers, electronic games etc. Also outside we have many ways of having fun – some include sports, activities including balls or skipping ropes etc.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-normans-build-so-many-castles>Why did the Normans build so many castles?</h2>
<p>Also having hundreds of castles up and down the country must have been hard work to build, so they had to build them where they especially needed a lot of power restored in a village.The Normans also built castles to keep law and order. This would help stop a lot of rebellions and would help keep law and order for the people in the town.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-william-keep-control-of-england-with-castles>How did William keep control of England with castles?</h2>
<p>Unlike Anglo-Saxon fortified towns, a Norman motte and bailey castle could be built very quickly, in some cases it only took a few days. William had 8000 men to try and consolidate his power in England. Building motte and bailey castles were an effective way of securing towns that had submitted to his power.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-the-normans-change-the-daily-life-of-england>How did the Normans change the daily life of England?</h2>
<p>To secure their hold over England the Normans introduced many changes to people’s daily lives. The justice and tax systems of England were amended to secure Norman power in England. Most villages in England were not further than a day’s walk from a large church and castle.</p>
