<p>Clan Carruthers<br>
Clan Carruthers: Mary Queen of Scots. Mary I of Scotland was from the Royal House of Stuart. She reigned over Scotland from the 14th December 1542 to 24 July 1567.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-stewarts-come-from>Where did the Stewarts come from?</h2>
<p>Originating from Brittany, the family name had been Fitzalan. This was changed after Walter Fitzalan entered the service of David I of Scotland (reigning from 1124 – 1153) and was appointed High Steward of Scotland. Walter’s great grandson later adopted the title as a surname and the family became the Stewarts.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-mary-queen-of-scots-related-to-elizabeth>How is Mary, Queen of Scots related to Elizabeth?</h2>
<p>How were Mary, Queen of Scots and Queen Elizabeth I related? Long story short: Mary and Elizabeth were first cousins once removed through King Henry VII of England. Margaret went to Scotland and married James IV; their son, James V, had Mary with his second wife, Mary of Guise.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-trying-to-force-mary-queen-of-scots-to-marry>Who was trying to force Mary Queen of Scots to marry?</h2>
<p>A Roman Catholic and regent from 1554, she had to contend with both the rising tide of Protestantism in Scotland and the machinations of the English who had tried to force a marriage between the baby queen and Edward Tudor, the young heir to the English throne.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-and-queen-of-scotland-in-1542>Who was the king and Queen of Scotland in 1542?</h2>
<p>James was Mary’s one and only child, conceived with her second husband, Henry Stewart. Mary was the Queen of Scotland from her father’s death in December 1542 until she was forced to abdicate the throne to her infant son James in July 1567. Following her first husband Francis’s death, Mary returned to Scotland from France in 1561.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-mary-queen-of-scots-change-her-name-to-stuart>Why did Mary Queen of Scots change her name to Stuart?</h2>
<p>It is said that the spelling of the royal family name of Stewart changed to Stuart at that time, to suit French conventional spelling. Tall, graceful and quick-witted, Mary married the Dauphin in Paris on 24 April 1558.</p>
