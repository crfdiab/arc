<h2 id=what-trade-network-helped-the-spread-of-religion-from-asia-east-to-europe>What trade network helped the spread of religion from Asia East to Europe?</h2>
<p>the Silk Road<br>
Over the centuries for two thousand years the Silk Road was a network of roads for the travel and dissemination of religious beliefs across Eurasia.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-that-spread-because-of-trade>What was the religion that spread because of trade?</h2>
<p>Buddhism spread from India into northern Asia, Mongolia, and China, whilst Christianity and Islam emerged and were disseminated by trade, pilgrims, and military conquest. The literary, architectural and artistic effects of this can be traced today in the cultures of civilizations along the Silk Routes.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-christianity-growing-the-fastest>Where is Christianity growing the fastest?</h2>
<p>Christianity has been estimated to be growing rapidly in South America, Africa, and Asia.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-silk-route-help-in-the-spread-of-religion>How did the Silk Route help in the spread of religion?</h2>
<p>Buddhism. The Silk Road provided a network for the spread of the teachings of the Buddha, enabling Buddhism to become a world religion and to develop into a sophisticated and diverse system of belief and practice. Of the 18 Buddhist schools of interpretation, five existed along the Silk Road.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-religion-spread-throughout-the-world>How did religion spread throughout the world?</h2>
<p>Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are five of the biggest religions in the world. Through countless conflicts, conquests, missions abroad, and simple word of mouth, these religions spread around the globe and forever molded the huge geographic regions in their paths.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-trade-relations-between-europe-and-asia>What are the trade relations between Europe and Asia?</h2>
<p>Within Europe, Switzerland comes second in exports to Asia, particularly to China and India, surpassing Germany in the latter. On the institutional side, trade relations between European and Asian countries are being strengthened. 2019 saw a new trade agreement between the EU and Japan coming into force.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-spread-of-christianity-take-place>Where did the spread of Christianity take place?</h2>
<p>First, the spread of Christianity occurred generally in a West to East fashion. There is little movement of Christianity from South to North within Asia. This is predictable based on the major trade routes.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-trade-affect-the-spread-of-christianity>How did trade affect the spread of Christianity?</h2>
<p>In practice, this ability to control trade also meant that they were often the traders.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-eastern-church-spread-to-asia>How did the Eastern Church spread to Asia?</h2>
<p>With great scholarship, growth, and missionary fervor, the Eastern church spread over much of Asia in the first millennium. This is a short article to correct this misconception. Many of the “unreached” people groups of Asia had ancestors who were Christian… of the Eastern Church.</p>
