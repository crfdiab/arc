<p>The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), established by Congress on March 31, 1933, provided jobs for young, unemployed men during the Great Depression. Over its 9-year lifespan, the CCC employed about 3 million men nationwide.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-ccc-and-fdic>What was the purpose of the CCC and FDIC?</h2>
<p>Among these was the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which was established to protect depositors from losing their savings in the event of bank failure. Another program was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which put thousands of men to work on projects in national forests, parks, and public lands.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-goals-of-the-ccc>What were the goals of the CCC?</h2>
<p>The program’s primary goal was to bring poor young men out of America’s urban centers to rehabilitate their health and morale while contributing to their families’ economic well being. A secondary goal focused on the country’s needs for conservation in forests, farmland and parks.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-ccc-so-successful>Why was the CCC so successful?</h2>
<p>Finally, the CCC had a lasting effect on its enrollees. Life in the camps brought tangible benefits to the health, educational level, and employment expectancies of almost three million young Americans, and it also gave immediate financial aid to their families. Equally important were the intangibles of Corps life.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-civilian-conservation-corps-important-to-the-new-deal>Why was the Civilian Conservation Corps important to the New Deal?</h2>
<p>CCC and the New Deal. President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC, with an executive order on April 5, 1933. The CCC was part of his New Deal legislation, combating high unemployment during the Great Depression by putting hundreds of thousands of young men to work on environmental conservation projects.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-ccc-do-for-the-us>What did the CCC do for the US?</h2>
<p>Under the guidance of the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture, CCC employees fought forest fires, planted trees, cleared and maintained access roads, re-seeded grazing lands and implemented soil-erosion controls. They built wildlife refuges, fish-rearing facilities,…</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-worked-in-the-ccc-during-the-new-deal>How many people worked in the CCC during the New Deal?</h2>
<p>From 1933 to 1942, the CCC employed over 3 million men. Of Roosevelt’s many New Deal policies, the CCC is considered by many to be one of the most enduring and successful. It provided the model for future state and federal conservation programs.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-civilian-conservation-corps-build-roads>How did the Civilian Conservation Corps build roads?</h2>
<p>Civilian Conservation Corps. With little more than strong backs, shovels, and picks, the CCC built roads, trails, culverts, and structures. When building structures, the CCC utilized native materials, such as the local sandstone, which they quarried themselves with star drills, sledge hammers, muscle, and sweat.</p>
