<h2 id=how-does-using-coal-affect-the-environment>How does using coal affect the environment?</h2>
<p>Several principal emissions result from coal combustion: Sulfur dioxide (SO2), which contributes to acid rain and respiratory illnesses. Nitrogen oxides (NOx), which contribute to smog and respiratory illnesses. Particulates, which contribute to smog, haze, and respiratory illnesses and lung disease.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-china-benefit-from-coal>How does China benefit from coal?</h2>
<p>The coal industry is very important to China, as it not only represents an inexpensive energy supply, which is very important for rapid economic growth, but also holds large-scale employment of close to six million workers. The coal industry thus often receives China’s largest government subsidies.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-positive-and-negative-effects-of-mining-coal-both-for-humans-and-the-environment>What are the positive and negative effects of mining coal both for humans and the environment?</h2>
<p>The clearing of trees, plants, and topsoil from mining areas destroys forests and natural wildlife habitats. It also promotes soil erosion and flooding, and stirs up dust pollution that can lead to respiratory problems in nearby communities.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-coal-energy-bad-for-the-environment>Why is coal energy bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>Along with adding to greenhouse gas pollution, burning coal emits toxic and carcinogenic substances into our air, water and land, severely affecting the health of miners, workers and surrounding communities. In India, coal kills about 169,000 people annually.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-coal-advantages-and-disadvantages>What is coal advantages and disadvantages?</h2>
<p>Coal energy is an affordable energy source because of the coal’s stable price compared to other fuel sources. Coal is easy to burn. Coal produces high energy upon combustion. Coal energy is inexpensive.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-does-coal-have-on-human-health>What impact does coal have on human health?</h2>
<p>Coal and Air Pollution Air pollution from coal-fired power plants is linked with asthma, cancer, heart and lung ailments, neurological problems, acid rain, global warming, and other severe environmental and public health impacts.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-negative-effects-of-mining-on-the-environment>What are the negative effects of mining on the environment?</h2>
<p>Mine exploration, construction, operation, and maintenance may result in land-use change, and may have associated negative impacts on environments, including deforestation, erosion, contamination and alteration of soil profiles, contamination of local streams and wetlands, and an increase in noise level, dust and …</p>
<h2 id=how-does-coal-pollute-the-air>How does coal pollute the air?</h2>
<p>Climate change is coal’s most serious, long-term, global impact. Chemically, coal is mostly carbon, which, when burned, reacts with oxygen in the air to produce carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas. When released into the atmosphere, carbon dioxide works like a blanket, warming the earth above normal limits.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-coal-use-affect-health-in-china>How does coal use affect health in China?</h2>
<p>Fluctuating from rural to urban areas, 22-55% of households rely on coal, resulting in many sick people. Here is a link to a paper by Bob Finkelman, USGS, on Health impacts of domestic coal use in China .</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-use-of-coal-affect-the-environment>How does the use of coal affect the environment?</h2>
<p>When you burn coal you put a lot of harmful chemicals into the air. After this chemicals are released into the ozone it can have a major effect on it. Since China is burning coal at a high rate they need to slow down and cut back on the burning of coal. Advertisements.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-chinas-environment-becoming-increasingly-important>Why is China’s Environment becoming increasingly important?</h2>
<p>In rural areas of China, coal and biomass fuels are still widely used in stoves and produce substantial indoor air pollution. The evidence for adverse health effects of solid fuels is strong, including lung cancer, acute respiratory infection, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Zhang and Smith 2007).</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-regulations-on-coal-burning-in-china>Are there any regulations on coal burning in China?</h2>
<p>In China there are not many regulations with coal burning especially since people are just able to use it in their homes and sometimes they are burning much more dangerous forms of fuel instead of coal. As far as the migration of coal there is a problem that any coal burning area has to deal with and that is fly and bottom ash (FA and BA).</p>
