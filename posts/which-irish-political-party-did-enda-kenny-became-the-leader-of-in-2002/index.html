<h2 id=which-political-position-did-bertie-ahern-hold-in-2002>Which political position did Bertie Ahern hold in 2002?</h2>
<p>Ahern, Bertie Ahern was first elected to the Dáil Éireann in 1977. He served as vice president (1983–94) of Fianna Fáil, before becoming leader. He succeeded John Bruton as taoiseach. Ahern was re-elected in 2002.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-the-prime-minister-of-ireland-in-1920>Who was the Prime Minister of Ireland in 1920?</h2>
<p>No such office was provided for in the Government of Ireland Act 1920; however, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, as with governors-general in other Westminster Systems such as in Canada, chose to appoint someone to head the executive even though no such post existed in statute law.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-prime-minister-of-northern-ireland-in-1974>Who was the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland in 1974?</h2>
<p>In contrast with the Westminster-style system of the earlier Stormont government, the new Northern Ireland Executive operates on the principles of consociational democracy . In 1974, Brian Faulkner was chosen to lead the Northern Ireland Executive not as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland but as Chief Executive of Northern Ireland . 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-the-prime-minister-of-ireland>How old is the Prime Minister of Ireland?</h2>
<p>The 40-year-old, whose post is officially called ‘Taoiseach,’ is the 14th Prime Minister of Ireland, a post he was elected to in June 2017. He came out as gay in 2015, becoming the first Irish minister to do so.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-gay-prime-minister-of-ireland>Who was the first gay Prime Minister of Ireland?</h2>
<p>He came out as gay in 2015, becoming the first Irish minister to do so. He is hence the first gay Prime Minister of Ireland, as well as the fourth openly gay head of government in the modern times. Additionally, he is the first Indian-origin Taoiseach of Ireland.</p>
