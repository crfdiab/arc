<h2 id=how-do-microplastics-get-into-the-atmosphere>How do microplastics get into the atmosphere?</h2>
<p>They are broken down into plastic particles that sit on the top layer of the water, where they are tossed into the air by waves and wind. There are several other ways microplastics enter the atmosphere, in large cities through the wind, and in farms through soil dust during agricultural processes.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-particles-in-snow>Are there particles in snow?</h2>
<p>Snow is precipitation in the form of ice crystals. Snow pellets, or graupel, are opaque ice particles in the atmosphere. They form as ice crystals fall through supercooled cloud droplets, which are below freezing but remain a liquid. The cloud droplets then freeze to the crystals, forming a lumpy mass.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-it-look-like-it-has-snowed-on-the-beach-plastic>Why did it look like it has snowed on the beach plastic?</h2>
<p>The researchers think microplastics are being blown about by winds and then – through mechanisms which are not fully understood – transported long distances through the atmosphere. The particles are then “washed” out of the atmosphere through precipitation, particularly snow.</p>
<h2 id=does-snow-have-plastic-in-it>Does snow have plastic in it?</h2>
<p>It’s snowing plastic. And then, a few months later, scientists found it in the snow. In August, researchers published a paper finding microplastic in the snow of the Swiss Alps, as well as from the Arctic, likely transported by wind.</p>
<h2 id=do-microplastics-ever-go-away>Do microplastics ever go away?</h2>
<p>Natural processes including sunlight cause plastic to become brittle, fragment and break. But fragmentation doesn’t stop there: microplastics can keep breaking up until they are like dust particles.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-microplastic-bad>Why is Microplastic bad?</h2>
<p>If ingested, microplastics can block the gastrointestinal tracts of organisms, or trick them into thinking they don’t need to eat, leading to starvation. Many toxic chemicals can also adhere to the surface of plastic and, if ingested, contaminated microplastics could expose organisms to high concentrations of toxins.”</p>
<h2 id=what-looks-like-snow-but-isn-t>What looks like snow but isn t?</h2>
<p>Graupel (/ˈɡraʊpəl/; German: [ˈɡʁaʊpl̩]), also called soft hail, corn snow, hominy snow, or snow pellets, is precipitation that forms when supercooled water droplets are collected and freeze on falling snowflakes, forming 2–5 mm (0.08–0.20 in) balls of crisp, opaque rime.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-plastic-in-the-snow>Why is there plastic in the snow?</h2>
<p>A team of German-Swiss researchers has found that microscopic particles of plastic are falling out of the sky with snow in the Arctic. Researchers collected snow samples from the Svalbard islands using a low-tech method – a dessert spoon and a flask. They found more than 10,000 of them per litre of melted snow.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-plastic-in-the-arctic>Why is there plastic in the Arctic?</h2>
<p>Some may have leaked out of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and flowed north through the Bering Strait. Scooped up by freezing seas, ice-trapped rubbish traverses the Arctic on the Transpolar Drift. Now, a new study suggests microplastics also float on air currents to land in the Arctic as plastic-laced snow.</p>
<h2 id=is-microplastic-airborne>Is Microplastic airborne?</h2>
<p>New research reveals how airborne microplastics travel around the world. Old plastic waste eventually breaks down into microscopic pieces, which can then become airborne.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-get-rid-of-microplastics>How do you get rid of microplastics?</h2>
<p>6 Ways to Use Less Plastic</p>
<ol>
<li>Do: Drink tap water. Don’t: Rely on bottled water.</li>
<li>Do: Heat food in or on the stove, or by microwaving in glass. Don’t: Microwave in plastic.</li>
<li>Do: Buy and store food in glass, silicone, or foil.</li>
<li>Do: Eat fresh food as much as possible.</li>
<li>Do: Vacuum regularly.</li>
<li>Do: Work with your community.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-many-microplastics-are-in-arctic-sea-ice>How many microplastics are in Arctic sea ice?</h2>
<p>Bergmann added that microplastics should be included in air pollutant monitoring schemes. Bergmann had previously found 12,000 microplastic particles per litre in samples of Arctic sea ice: “So we asked where does it all come from?”</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-ice-to-have-particles-in-it>What causes ice to have particles in it?</h2>
<p>Particles in ice can be caused by the mineral components of the water, which accumulates in the ice tray. In this case, a water purifying system may be required. Particles in ice can also be caused by debris in the ice bin.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-mass-of-the-water-displaced-by-the-ice>How is the mass of the water displaced by the ice?</h2>
<p>The mass of the water displaced by the ice is the same as the water poured out and frozen. The ice floating above the water represents the volume increase of the water due to the freezing process. I hope this helps understand the process. Not the answer you’re looking for?</p>

Including ice and snow in a study of the water cycle also provides an opportunity to teach states and changes of matter in a real-world context.</p>
