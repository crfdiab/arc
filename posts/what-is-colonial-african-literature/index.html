<h2 id=what-is-colonial-african-literature>What is colonial African literature?</h2>
<p>Literature in colonial Africa is synonymous with writing about life shaped by the colonial experience of direct rule and domination by imperialist powers. From most definitions of ‘postcolonial literature’, literature in colonial Africa is postcolonial.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-colonization-affect-african-language>How did colonization affect African language?</h2>
<p>During colonization, colonizers usually imposed their language onto the peoples they colonized, forbidding natives to speak their mother tongues. In some cases colonizers systematically prohibited native languages.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-colonialism-literature>What is colonialism literature?</h2>
<p>“’Colonial literature’ is most easily defined as literature written during a time of colonization, usually from the point of view of colonizers. This literature is a reaction to colonization.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-characteristics-of-colonial-african-literature>What are the characteristics of colonial African literature?</h2>
<p>Characteristics of African literature include slave narratives, protests against colonization, calls for independence, African pride, hope for the future, and dissent.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-characteristics-of-postcolonial-literature>What are the characteristics of postcolonial literature?</h2>
<p>Postcolonial Literature Characteristics</p>
<ul>
<li>Appropriation of Colonial Languages. Postcolonial writers have this thing they like to do.</li>
<li>Metanarrative. Colonizers liked to tell a certain story.</li>
<li>Colonialism.</li>
<li>Colonial Discourse.</li>
<li>Rewriting History.</li>
<li>Decolonization Struggles.</li>
<li>Nationhood and Nationalism.</li>
<li>Valorization of Cultural Identity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=are-there-any-positive-effects-of-colonialism-in-africa>Are there any positive effects of colonialism in Africa?</h2>
<p>The truth is that, colonial rule did not just had negative impacts. There are areas where it really contributed positively and Africa is still enjoying some of those positive effects till today. One of those areas is the exposure to westen education.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-theme-of-african-literature>What was the main theme of African literature?</h2>
<p>Colonialism and its effects have been a predominant theme in African literature. African dramatists, novelists and even poets have often times showcased these ideas through their writings in order to reveal the evils of colonialism on the African identity.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-colonial-education-affect-the-african-culture>How did colonial education affect the African culture?</h2>
<p>Through the comparison of colonial and post-colonial education we can see the affects that colonial education has on African formations. A repeating theme can be seen in the works we have covered so far, that is the way African culture is perceived by colonists and the church.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-dawn-of-african-literature-important>Why was the dawn of African literature important?</h2>
<p>Thus, the dawn of African Literature was in response to the denigrations, history and myths constructed about Africa in conjunction with the colonial enterprise by European authors. This essay is an evaluation of whether African literature has been successful in reclaiming the stories of Africa.</p>
