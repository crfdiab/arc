<h2 id=what-bodies-of-water-are-near-germany>What bodies of water are near Germany?</h2>
<p>Germany faces the North Sea to the northwest and Baltic Sea to the northeast. A narrow strip of land on which Germany borders Denmark separates the two seas, both of which are extensions of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-germany-get-water>Where does Germany get water?</h2>
<p>groundwater<br>
Most drinking water in Germany — more than 70% of it — is sourced from groundwater. But Jörg Rechenberg, head of the Water and Soil Division at the Federal Environment Agency (UBA), says it’s difficult to draw a direct connection between the state of groundwater levels and the dryness of the soil.</p>
<h2 id=is-water-scarce-in-germany>Is water scarce in Germany?</h2>
<p>Germans have never had to worry much about water scarcity. But with rising global temperatures driving record heatwaves and prolonged droughts, demand for the precious resource is increasing. After all, there is still an abundance of water in Germany.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-drink-tap-water-in-germany>Is it safe to drink tap water in Germany?</h2>
<p>Yes, tap water is safe and the most controlled beverage/food product in Germany. Many German cities including Berlin and Munich brag about the quality of their tap water which often comes from the same source as mineral water.</p>
<h2 id=is-germany-water-rich>Is Germany water rich?</h2>
<p>Germany is a country rich in water; 2.2% of its surface area is covered by water. The water surface is comprised of eleven large rivers (Elbe, Danube, Rhine, Weser, Ems, Warnow/Peene, Elder, Schiel/Trave, Oder, Rhône, Maas). The largest amount of water, approximately 56%, is used as cooling water by power authorities.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-bodies-of-water-in-germany>What are the major bodies of water in Germany?</h2>
<p>The major bodies of water in Germany are the Danube, Rhine, Elbe and Weser rivers. Germany does have some small lakes, but these are mostly glacial and located in the mountains. The largest lake, Bodensee, lies on Germany’s border with Switzerland and Austria.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-water-park-in-germany>Which is the best water park in Germany?</h2>
<p>Lots of different themes areas to play in, and a huge indoor area where u can play with the Playmobil sets and toys. 6. Tropical Islands 7. Sensapolis</p>
<h2 id=how-many-lakes-are-there-in-berlin-germany>How many lakes are there in Berlin Germany?</h2>
<p>Berlin and its surrounding state of Brandenburg can be also called “ the land of 3,000 lakes ”. With more than 30,000 Kilometers of waterways, the area is the largest water landscape in Germany and, together with the northern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, forms the largest closed inland water system in Europe.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-three-great-rivers-in-germany>Where are the three great rivers in Germany?</h2>
<p>The three great rivers, the Rhine, Danube & Elbe, dominate the Waterways of Germany. They are connected by a network of canals in the north and by the river Main & the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in the south. The lakes regions of Mecklenburg & Brandenburg near Berlin are populated with many bases for self-skippered boat rentals.</p>
