<h2 id=how-did-the-mafia-start-in-america>How did the Mafia start in America?</h2>
<p>The Sicilian Mafia was founded in Sicily by elements of the Camorra, a crime organization established in Naples, in the early 1800’s. It became established in the United States through the immigration of some of its members in the latter 1800’s, the early 1900’s, and the mid-1960’s and early 1970’s.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-idea-why-they-established-the-mafia>What is the main idea why they established the Mafia?</h2>
<p>The ‘mafia’ is generally thought of as an Italian secret crime society, but the origins of the Mafia start way before the onset of automatic guns and cocaine. The Mafia began as a way of life: a way to protect one’s family and loved ones from the injustice of the government.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-sicilian-mafia-still-exist>Does the Sicilian Mafia still exist?</h2>
<p>Those currently active in the United States are the Sicilian Mafia, Camorra or Campanian Mafia, ‘Ndrangheta or Calabrian Mafia, and Sacra Corona Unita or “United Sacred Crown”. These Italian crime groups frequently collaborate with the Italian-American Mafia, which is itself an offshoot of the Sicilian Mafia.</p>
<h2 id=who-started-the-mafia-in-sicily>Who started the Mafia in Sicily?</h2>
<p>History of La Cosa Nostra. Giuseppe Esposito was the first known Sicilian Mafia member to emigrate to the U.S. He and six other Sicilians fled to New York after murdering the chancellor and a vice chancellor of a Sicilian province and 11 wealthy landowners. He was arrested in New Orleans in 1881 and extradited to Italy …</p>
<h2 id=is-italy-expensive-to-live>Is Italy expensive to live?</h2>
<p>Italy is an amazing country for expats. In general, the northern Italian regions and big cities are the most expensive. These areas tend to cost more than living in the U.S. But if you steer clear of tourist hubs and opt for life in a small town, it can be quite affordable.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-drink-tap-water-in-sicily>Can you drink tap water in Sicily?</h2>
<p>Water — Most Sicilians have mineral water with their meals. Tap water is normally potable everywhere, including at public drinking fountains. Unsafe sources will be marked ACQUA NON POTABILE. Some cities along the southern coast get their water supply exclusively from a sea-water desalinator, making it non-potable.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-american-mafia-the-same-as-the-sicilian-mafia>Is the American Mafia the same as the Sicilian Mafia?</h2>
<p>Like the Sicilian Mafia, the American Mafia did not use the term mafia to describe itself. Neither group has a formal name and instead used the term cosa nostra (Italian for ‘our thing’) when referring to themselves. When Italian immigrants started forming organized crime groups in the United States,…</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-mafia-first-formed-in-sicily>When was the Mafia first formed in Sicily?</h2>
<p>The mafia was first formed in the 9th century when Arabs occupied Sicily; native Sicilians were oppressed and forced to take refuge in surrounding hills.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-mafia-member-to-immigrate-to-america>Who was the First Mafia member to immigrate to America?</h2>
<p>Giuseppe Morello was the first known Mafia member to immigrate to the United States. He and six other Sicilians fled to New York after murdering eleven wealthy landowners, the chancellor and a vice chancellor of a Sicilian province.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-a-crime-to-pay-the-mafia-in-sicily>Is it a crime to pay the Mafia in Sicily?</h2>
<p>Some areas of Sicily are free of this extortion whilst others are plagued by it. Business owners in this position either pay, and keep it secret because it is a crime to give money to the Mafia, or they report it to the police and risk being murdered if the Mafia find out.</p>
