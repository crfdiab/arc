<h2 id=what-are-environmental-problems-in-arizona>What are environmental problems in Arizona?</h2>
<p>Climate Change’s Impact on Arizona’s Environment Air and water quality will suffer. Low river flows and higher water temperatures will raise water pollution concentrations. Ozone and smog concentrations will rise with higher air temperatures and growing energy use.</p>
<h2 id=is-arizona-becoming-overpopulated>Is Arizona becoming overpopulated?</h2>
<p>Arizona is the second-fastest growing state with a percent growth of 1.78%. Arizona’s population increased by 129,558 from 7,291,843 in 2019 to 7,421,401 in 2020.</p>
<h2 id=what-environmental-problems-does-phoenix-have>What environmental problems does Phoenix have?</h2>
<p>Phoenix is no stranger to environmental issues. Despite a minor improvement in the Sierra Club’s report card – Gov. Doug Ducey received a D in 2015 compared to a D+ in 2016 – problems with water, air quality, recycling, renewable energy and a warming climate continue to plague Phoenix.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-pollution-so-bad-in-phoenix>Why is pollution so bad in Phoenix?</h2>
<p>As the days get longer, ozone pollution will worsen in Phoenix. Most of Arizona’s ozone is caused by vehicle exhaust, which produces nitrogen oxides, or NOx. Ozone, a colorless, odorless gas, forms when NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react in sunlight.</p>
<h2 id=how-bad-is-pollution-in-phoenix>How bad is pollution in Phoenix?</h2>
<p>The American Lung Association’s 2019 “State of the Air” report found Phoenix has earned poorer rankings for the nation’s most widespread air pollutants. The annual air quality “report card” tracks Americans’ exposure to unhealthful levels of ozone or particle pollution, both of which can be deadly.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-environment-in-phoenix-az>How is the environment in Phoenix, AZ?</h2>
<p>Phoenix, Arizona is now one of the most polluted areas in the United States. Particle pollution is a combination of soot, dust, and aerosols that are suspended in the air. Arizona ranks 14th in the u.s. for global warming pollution from power plants.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-climate-is-found-in-arizona>What kind of climate is found in Arizona?</h2>
<p>Climate of Arizona About half of Arizona is semiarid, one-third is arid, and the remainder is humid. The Basin and Range region has the arid and semiarid subtropical climate that attracts most winter visitors and new residents.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-geography-of-the-state-of-arizona>What is the geography of the state of Arizona?</h2>
<p>The Basin and Range region of the southern and western third of the state contains the bulk of the population but none of the large canyons and mesas for which Arizona is famous. It consists largely of broad, open-ended basins or valleys of gentle slope. Isolated northwest-to-southeast–tending mountain ranges rise like islands in the desert plain.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-vegetation-is-found-in-arizona>What kind of vegetation is found in Arizona?</h2>
<p>Considering the variety in relief and climate, it is not surprising to find similar diversity in the state’s vegetation. About one-tenth of Arizona is forested, one-fourth is woodland, one-fourth is grassland, and the rest is desert shrub.</p>
