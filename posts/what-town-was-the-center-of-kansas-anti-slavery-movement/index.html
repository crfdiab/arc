<p>Lawrence, Kansas<br>
The Free State Hotel was left in ruins after the raid on Lawrence, Kansas in 1856. Lawrence was the center of Kansas’s anti-slavery movement. It was named for Amos Lawrence, a New England financier who provided aid to anti-slavery farmers and settlers.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-abolitionist-take-place>Where did the abolitionist take place?</h2>
<p>The abolitionist movement emerged in states like New York and Massachusetts. The leaders of the movement copied some of their strategies from British activists who had turned public opinion against the slave trade and slavery.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-kansas-nebraska-act-take-place>Where did Kansas Nebraska Act take place?</h2>
<p>The Kansas-Nebraska Act began a chain of events in the Kansas Territory that foreshadowed the Civil War. He said he wanted to see Nebraska made into a territory and, to win southern support, proposed a southern state inclined to support slavery. It was Kansas.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-kansas-territory-located-in-the-united-states>Where was the Kansas Territory located in the United States?</h2>
<p>The territory extended from the Missouri border west to the summit of the Rocky Mountains and from the 37th parallel north to the 40th parallel north. Originally part of Missouri Territory, it was unorganized from 1821 to 1854.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-abolitionist-movement-in-kansas>Who was the leader of the abolitionist movement in Kansas?</h2>
<p>A war of revenge erupted in Kansas led primarily by abolitionist John Brown. In reprisal for the Sacking of Lawrence, Brown and six companions dragged five pro-slavery men and boys from their beds at Pottawatomie Creek , split open their skulls with a sword and cut off their hands.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-pro-slavery-movement-in-kansas-start>When did the pro slavery movement in Kansas start?</h2>
<p>Competition between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions reached a climax on May 30, 1855, when Kansas held territorial elections. Although only 1,500 men were registered to vote, 6,000 ballots were cast, many of them by pro-slavery “border ruffians” from Missouri.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-john-brown-do-in-the-abolitionist-movement>What did John Brown do in the abolitionist movement?</h2>
<p>In retaliation, abolitionist John Brown organized a raid that killed five pro-slavery settlers. Then, in 1859, Brown led 21 men to capture the U.S. arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. He and his followers were seized by a group of Marines and convicted of treason. Brown was hanged for the crime.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-kansas-established-as-a-free-state>Why was Kansas established as a Free State?</h2>
<p>The Act repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 which marked a line of latitude to be the separation of free and slave states. The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed the settlers of Kansas Territory to determine by popular sovereignty whether Kansas would be a free state or a slave state. The Act contained thirty-seven sections.</p>
