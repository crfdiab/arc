<h2 id=do-humans-live-in-antarctica>Do humans live in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Antarctica is the only continent with no permanent human habitation. There are, however, permanent human settlements, where scientists and support staff live for part of the year on a rotating basis. The continent of Antarctica makes up most of the Antarctic region.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-be-a-citizen-of-antarctica>Can you be a citizen of Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Are you a citizen of Antarctica? The answer has to be unequivocally, “no”—Antarctica’s not a country, it’s a continent that will never be a nation. But no biggie, say artists Lucy and George Orta. They’re giving out passports to Antarctica, anyway, reports Allison Meier for Hyperallergic.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-people-that-live-in-antarctica>Who are the people that live in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>People living in the Antarctica are mostly women now. According to latest research, people living in German Antarctic station are totally women. Also %50-%50 in some stations. Before 1963, only men were going to Antarctica and living there but today there are many women going and living in Antarctica.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-live-in-the-antarctic-station>How many people live in the Antarctic station?</h2>
<p>People living in the station are now 1200 people. There are 29 nations has right to send people to Antarctica for scientific research based on The Antarctic Treaty. There is no known Antartican language and people living there are speaking their own language. Also many tourists come to Antarctica in the winter.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-life-in-the-field-in-antarctica>How is life in the field in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>It is very cold and often windy, like the top of a mountain. Living ‘in the field’, away from the main station, you experience this difference very strongly. In other ways Antarctic life is quite like ‘home’ — people at the stations have fully insulated living and working quarters with their own rooms and bath/toilet facilities.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-be-born-in-antarctica-to-be-a-citizen>Do you have to be born in Antarctica to be a citizen?</h2>
<p>Theoretically speaking, anyone born on territory in Antarctica would become a citizen of the specific country that claims that territory. People don’t live and work in Antarctica for indefinite periods of time i.e. they stay there for as long as missions demand or until certain research is completed.</p>
