<h2 id=what-event-started-the-war-in-europe>What event started the war in Europe?</h2>
<p>Hitler’s invasion of Poland in September 1939 drove Great Britain and France to declare war on Germany, marking the beginning of World War II.</p>
<h2 id=what-event-immediately-led-to-the-end-of-wwii>What event immediately led to the end of WWII?</h2>
<p>The United States drops an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The Soviet Union declares war on Japan and invades Manchuria. The United States drops an atomic bomb on Nagasaki. Having agreed in principle to unconditional surrender on August 14, 1945, Japan formally surrenders, ending World War II.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-world-war-2-the-most-destructive-conflict-in-history>Why was World war 2 the most destructive conflict in history?</h2>
<p>It began when Nazi Germany unleashed ferocious attacks across Europe – but it spread to the Soviet Union, China, Japan and the United States. Cities were destroyed by air raids, the atom bomb was dropped on Japan and six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Over 50 million soldiers and civilians died.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-brutal-country-in-ww2>What was the most brutal country in ww2?</h2>
<p>World War Two was the most destructive global conflict in history. It began when Nazi Germany unleashed ferocious attacks across Europe – but it spread to the Soviet Union, China, Japan and the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-major-events-in-european-history>What are some major events in European history?</h2>
<p>The power of its countries has stretched far beyond the continent, touching every corner of the Earth. Europe is known not only for its revolutions and wars but also for its sociocultural changes, including the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, and colonialism. The effects of these changes can still be seen in the world today.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-world-war-1-on-europe>What was the impact of World War 1 on Europe?</h2>
<p>Geopolitical Consequences of World War I. The years 1919-24 were marked by turmoil as Europe struggled to recover from the devastation of the First World War and the destabilizing effects of the loss of four large historic empires: the German Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, Russian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-europe-before-world-war-2>What was the history of Europe before World War 2?</h2>
<p>Events preceding World War II in Europe. The events preceding World War II in Europe are closely tied to the bellicosity of Italy, Germany and Japan, as well as the Great Depression. The peace movement led to appeasement and disarmament.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-expansion-of-europe-affect-the-world>How did the expansion of Europe affect the world?</h2>
<p>Europeans have conquered, settled, and ruled a huge proportion of the Earth’s land mass. The effects of these overseas empires are still felt today. Historians generally agree that Europe’s colonial expansion happened in several phases.</p>
