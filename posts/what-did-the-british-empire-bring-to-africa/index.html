<h2 id=what-did-the-british-empire-bring-to-africa>What did the British Empire bring to Africa?</h2>
<p>For ordinary West Africans, British rule brought major changes to their everyday lives. The British brought in a system of owning, buying and selling land, which meant many Africans had to pay rent. This meant that instead of growing crops for food, they had to grow crops to sell (to pay the rent).</p>

<h2 id=what-parts-of-africa-did-britain-colonize>What parts of Africa did Britain colonize?</h2>
<p>Britain had many colonies in Africa: in British West Africa there was Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, Southern Cameroon, and Sierra Leone; in British East Africa there was Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania (formerly Tanganyika and Zanzibar); and in British South Africa there was South Africa, Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), Southern …</p>
<h2 id=how-much-of-africa-was-ruled-by-the-british>How much of Africa was ruled by the British?</h2>
<p>From 1880-1900 Britain gained control over or occupied what are now known as Egypt, Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi. That meant that the British ruled 30% of Africa’s people at one time.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-british-empire-located-in-africa>Where was the British Empire located in Africa?</h2>
<p>It included lands in North Africa, such as Egypt, much of West Africa, and huge territories in Southern and East Africa. Living under British rule in Africa was different, depending on which part of Africa you lived in.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-during-british-rule-in-africa>What was life like during British rule in Africa?</h2>
<p>Living under British rule in Africa was different, depending on which part of Africa you lived in. However, there is no doubt that British rule had a huge impact on the lives of millions of Africans. Photograph taken on the British governor’s tour of Tanganyika in 1925.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-scramble-for-africa-affect-the-british-empire>How did the Scramble for Africa affect the British Empire?</h2>
<p>During the Scramble for Africa, Britain gained much of Africa, especially in the south. By the start of the 20th century, the economies of Germany and the United States had begun catching up to Britain, especially in their industrialisation.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-arrival-of-the-british-affect-africa>How did the arrival of the British affect Africa?</h2>
<p>So it is difficult to make a sweeping judgement about British rule in Africa. The arrival of the British certainly disrupted traditional African culture and ways of living. It widened the gap between African chiefs and their people. It changed African economies and made them dependent on trade with Britain.</p>
