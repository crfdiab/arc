<h2 id=how-is-spanish-influence-still-seen-in-texas-today>How is Spanish influence still seen in Texas today?</h2>
<p>Many place names such as San Antonio, Corpus Christi, and El Paso, are of Spanish origin. The culture still thrives in Texas via food, entertainment, language, and celebrations such as Cinco de Mayo.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-impact-of-spanish-culture-in-texas>What is the impact of Spanish culture in Texas?</h2>
<p>Spanish ranching as it was practiced in Texas formed the basis for the American cattle industry, which drew many of its original cattle from the mission herds. The Spanish also brought to the San Antonio valley a specialized method of farming that used irrigation.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spanish-influence-the-texas-territory>How did the Spanish influence the Texas territory?</h2>
<p>The Spanish influence at all levels of contemporary Texas is considerable, perhaps out of proportion to the numbers of Spaniards (those who came directly from Spain) who ever set foot in the territory we now call Texas.

<p>Attempts to rebuild the Texas cattle industry were disrupted by the Mexican War of Independence in the early 1800s. Spanish stock raising had not recovered from the devastating effects of civil war, population dislocation, and Indian raids by the time Stephen F. Austin ‘s colonists arrived.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-spanish-come-to-east-texas>When did the Spanish come to East Texas?</h2>
<p>In 1690, Spanish missions spread to East Texas after news surfaced of La Salle’s French settlements in the area. The Spanish settlers there encountered the Caddo Indians, who they called “Tejas” (derived from the Caddoan word “Tay-yas”, meaning friend).</p>
