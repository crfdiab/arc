<h2 id=does-the-energy-of-ocean-waves-come-from-the-energy-of-deposition>Does the energy of ocean waves come from the energy of deposition?</h2>
<p>The energy of ocean waves comes from the energy of deposition. The flat, wide area of land along a river is called a meander. How do ocean waves form, and how do they change to cause water to erode land along a shoreline? forward-moving water erodes the land.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-energy-from-ocean-waves-come-from>Where does the energy from ocean waves come from?</h2>
<p>Ocean waves get their energy from wind blowing across the surface of the water. When the wind contacts the water, some of its energy is transferred.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-ocean-wave-erosion-and-deposition>What is the difference between ocean wave erosion and deposition?</h2>
<p>The motion of waves helps to shape shorelines. During erosion, waves remove sand from shorelines. During deposition, waves add sand to shorelines. Waves move in groups called wave trains.</p>
<h2 id=do-waves-cause-erosion-and-deposition>Do waves cause erosion and deposition?</h2>
<p>Over time, they erode the shore. The bigger the waves are and the more sediment they carry, the more erosion they cause (Figure below). Waves erode sediment from sea cliffs. The sediment is then deposited on beaches.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-waves-responsible-for-both-erosion-and-deposition>How are waves responsible for both erosion and deposition?</h2>
<p>As waves reach shallow water near the ocean shore, they begin to break. Another way waves causes erosion is by forcing water into cracks in the rocks at the shoreline. And in Deposition, waves carry large amounts of sand, rock particles and pieces of shell. At some point, waves deposit the material they carry.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-energy-of-ocean-waves-come-from>Where does the energy of ocean waves come from?</h2>
<p>Ocean wave energy is form of the kinetic energy that exists in the moving waves of the ocean since waves are caused by blowing winds over the surface of the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-wind-energy-when-it-reaches-the-ocean>What happens to wind energy when it reaches the ocean?</h2>
<p>Given that, on the ocean, wind energy gets transferred to the sea where it then takes the form of a wave. Ocean waves travel sometimes a thousand kilometers or more. When a wave reaches the shore or a reef it breaks.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-conspicuous-form-of-ocean-energy>Which is the most conspicuous form of Ocean Energy?</h2>
<p>The energy from surface waves is the most conspicuous form of ocean energy, possibly because of the, often spectacular, wave destructive effects. The waves are produced by wind action and are therefore an indirect form of solar energy.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-waves-related-to-the-deposition-of-sand>How are waves related to the deposition of sand?</h2>
<p>Waves also move sand from the beaches on shore to bars of sand offshore as the seasons change. In the summer, waves have lower energy so they bring sand up onto the beach. In the winter, higher energy waves bring the sand back offshore. Some of the features formed by wave-deposited sand are in Figure below.</p>
