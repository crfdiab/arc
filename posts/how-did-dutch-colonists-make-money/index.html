<h2 id=how-did-dutch-colonists-make-money>How did Dutch colonists make money?</h2>
<p>Colonists arrived in New Netherland from all over Europe. Many fled religious persecution, war, or natural disaster. Others were lured by the promise of fertile farmland, vast forests, and a lucrative trade in fur. Initially, beaver pelts purchased from local Indians were the colony’s primary source of wealth.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-dutch-colonists-do>What did the Dutch colonists do?</h2>
<p>Sponsored by the West India Company, 30 families arrived in North America in 1624, establishing a settlement on present-day Manhattan. Much like English colonists in Virginia, however, the Dutch settlers did not take much of an interest in agriculture, and focused on the more lucrative fur trade.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-jobs-were-available-in-colonial-north-carolina>What kind of jobs were available in colonial North Carolina?</h2>
<p>What Jobs Were Available in Colonial North Carolina? Colonial North Carolina’s warm, humid climate was perfect for growing tobacco and rice, so most early settlers worked on tobacco and rice plantations, according to the North Carolina Business History website HistoryNC.org.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-dutch-do-in-new-amsterdam>What did the Dutch do in New Amsterdam?</h2>
<p>The Dutch traders who founded their colony were businessmen and New Amsterdam was, above everything else, a commercial venture. This is still true in New York, actually. I mean, Manhattan is all about Wall Street.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-west-india-company-help-the-dutch>How did the West India Company help the Dutch?</h2>
<p>The West India Company gave up its trade monopoly, enabling other businessmen to invest in New Netherland. Profits flowed to Amsterdam, encouraging new economic activity in the production of food, timber, tobacco, and eventually, slaves. In 1647, the most successful of the Dutch Director Generals arrived in New Amsterdam.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-economy-did-the-dutch-have>What kind of economy did the Dutch have?</h2>
<p>During the Republic the first series of large-scale Dutch migrations outside of Europe took place. The Dutch people are often seen as the pioneers of capitalism, and their emphasis on a modern economy, secularism, and a free market has been hugely influential worldwide.</p>
