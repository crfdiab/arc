<h2 id=what-was-the-average-family-size-in-the-1930s>What was the average family size in the 1930s?</h2>
<p>The average number of people per household was 5.55 in 1850, 5.04 in 1880, 4.76 in 1900 and 4.54 in 1910. It declined to 4.34 in 1920, 4.11 in 1930, 3.67 in 1940, 3.37 in 1950 and 3.33 in 1960.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-children-did-the-average-family-have-in-1960>How many children did the average family have in 1960?</h2>
<p>The typical American picture of a family with 2.5 kids might not be as relevant as it once was: In 2020, there was an average of 1.93 children under 18 per family in the United States. This is a decrease from 2.33 children under 18 per family in 1960.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-average-family-size>What was the average family size?</h2>
<p>The average American family in 2020 consisted of 3.15 persons….Average number of people per family in the United States from 1960 to 2020.</p>

<h2 id=are-families-getting-bigger-or-smaller>Are families getting bigger or smaller?</h2>
<p>The size of the average family seems to be getting smaller, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Researchers looked at women born in England and Wales in 1964 and compared them with their mother’s generation, represented by women born in 1937.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-average-family-size-in-1850>What was the average family size in 1850?</h2>
<p>US Census data from 1850 show that families with six to nine kids were common. One reason why was that, back then, children were considered an economic asset: with enough kids, parents could rest assured that at least some would survive and care for them in old age.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cost-of-a-house-in-1939>What was the cost of a house in 1939?</h2>
<p>In 1939, the cost to purchase a house in the United States was between $3,800 and $6,400. Renting a house cost approximately $28 per month. Homebuilding back then was quite different from the construction industry of today.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-average-family-size-in-1980>What was the average family size in 1980?</h2>
<p>By the mid-20th century, families with only one or two kids were the norm. In 1980, less than 0.5% of all households had eight or more children; that category thus ceases to appear on our chart above. In 2000, the six-child household disappeared.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-average-size-of-a-house-in-1920>What was the average size of a house in 1920?</h2>
<p>And that mainly means the homes have gotten way bigger. The list tracks various stats year by year, including average square feet. Here’s a sample, with the figure referring to the average floor area of a new single-family home: 1920: 1,048 square feet. 1930: 1,129.</p>
