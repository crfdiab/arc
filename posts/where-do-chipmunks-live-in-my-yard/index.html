<h2 id=where-do-chipmunks-live-in-my-yard>Where do chipmunks live in my yard?</h2>
<p>Although most commonly found in forests, chipmunks will also make their homes in yards, where you might see them in and around stone walls, under walkways or patios, or in gardens.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-habitat-do-chipmunks-live-in>What kind of habitat do chipmunks live in?</h2>
<p>Chipmunks are excellent tree climbers and swimmers who live in a variety of habitats, including plains, mountains, forests, and deserts. Chipmunks like to live alone in holes or burrows called dens. Chipmunks hibernate in cold weather, which means they spend most of the winter sleeping in their dens.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-shoot-chipmunks-in-nc>Can you shoot chipmunks in NC?</h2>
<p>The Eastern chipmunk is a nongame species with no hunting or trapping season.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-baby-chipmunks-called>What are baby chipmunks called?</h2>
<p>pups<br>
Their young are called pups. A group of pups that are born to the same mother, at the same time, is called a litter. Pups are hairless, blind, pink creatures the size of a jelly bean.</p>
<h2 id=are-fox-squirrels-in-nc>Are fox squirrels in NC?</h2>
<p>The fox squirrel is the largest tree squirrel in North Carolina, nearly twice the size of the more common gray squirrel. It lives primarily in mature longleaf pine and open pine-oak forests in the Sandhills and southern Coastal Plain.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-chipmunks-live-in-the-united-states>Where do chipmunks live in the United States?</h2>
<p>The Eastern chipmunk is the largest member of the chipmunk species. This chipmunk can be found in the forests of eastern North America. The Hopi chipmunk inhabits the canyonlands and buttes of Southwest America. The Uinta chipmunk prefers the forests in the Western United States.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-chipmunk-hunting-season-in-nc>Is there a chipmunk hunting season in NC?</h2>
<p>Chipmunks remain more active in North Carolina winters, however, than in colder northern climes. The Eastern chipmunk is a nongame species with no hunting or trapping season.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-chipmunk-has-black-on-its-back>What kind of chipmunk has black on its back?</h2>
<p>With reddish brown fur, a black stripe down the center of its back and a set of two black stripes, one on either side, the eastern chipmunk has distinctive coloring. Chipmunks from the Carolinas are said to have brighter coloration than those to the north.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-chipmunks-go-to-sleep-in-the-winter>Where do Chipmunks Go to sleep in the winter?</h2>
<p>After foraging in the forest, the chipmunk comes back to the top burrow to sleep during the day. The deeper and more complex underground burrow is strictly reserved for winter. The tunnels can be as long as 30 feet long and go down to three feet into the ground. A chipmunk burrow is a masterpiece of engineering and portrays how smart they are.</p>
