<h2 id=where-did-the-waste-come-from>Where did the waste come from?</h2>
<p>Wastes may be generated during the extraction of raw materials, the processing of raw materials into intermediate and final products, the consumption of final products, and other human activities. Residuals recycled or reused at the place of generation are excluded.”</p>
<h2 id=how-does-waste-come-out-of-your-body>How does waste come out of your body?</h2>
<p>After the body has taken what it needs, from the food, the waste is sent to the blood. The kidneys filter out the waste products and excess fluids from the body and dispose of them in the form of urine, via the bladder. The clean blood flows back to the other parts of the body.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-food-waste-start>How did food waste start?</h2>
<p>Food became commercialized and went from farm to table and from to factory to table. Consequently, families started to waste food because it was less expensive and more accessible [2].</p>
<h2 id=who-proposed-the-waste-management-theory>Who proposed the waste management theory?</h2>
<p>Pongrácz<br>
References (9) The theoretical basis of this paper was the Waste Management Theory, which was introduced by Keiski, Pongrácz and Phillips (2004) to channel environmental sciences into engineering design. This theory is a unified body of knowledge on waste and waste management. …</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-dump-plastic-in-the-ocean>Why do we dump plastic in the ocean?</h2>
<p>Rain or stormwater and wind can carry the plastic waste into the sea or into drains that lead to the sea. Illegal dumping of trash is a significant contributor.</p>
<h2 id=why-should-the-waste-be-removed-from-the-body>Why should the waste be removed from the body?</h2>
<p>Your body also needs to remove the wastes that build up from cell activity and from digestion. If these wastes are not removed, your cells can stop working, and you can get very sick. The organs of your excretory system help to release wastes from the body.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-zero-garbage-system>What is meant by zero garbage system?</h2>
<p>Zero waste is a set of principles focused on waste prevention that encourages the redesign of resource life cycles so that all products are reused. The goal is for no trash to be sent to landfills, incinerators or the ocean. In a zero waste system, material will be reused until the optimum level of consumption.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-waste-management-theory>What is the waste management theory?</h2>
<p>Waste Management Theory is founded on the expectation that waste management is to prevent waste causing harm to human health and the environment. Definitions emerging from this condition may, however, conflict with the goals of waste prevention, because something that already exists cannot be prevented from arising.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-tons-of-hazardous-waste-are-produced-each-year>How many tons of hazardous waste are produced each year?</h2>
<p>Worldwide, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimated that more than 400 million tons of hazardous wastes are produced universally each year, mostly by industrialized countries (schmit, 1999).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-characteristics-of-a-hazardous-waste>What are the characteristics of a hazardous waste?</h2>
<p>Hazardous waste is waste that has substantial or potential threats to public health or the environment. Characteristic hazardous wastes are materials that are known or tested to exhibit one or more of the following hazardous traits: Ignitability.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-hazardous-wastes-burned-as-an-energy-source>How are hazardous wastes burned as an energy source?</h2>
<p>Hazardous waste may be “destroyed”. For example, by incinerating them at a high temperature, flammable wastes can sometimes be burned as energy sources. For example, many cement kilns burn hazardous wastes like used oils or solvents.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-cercla-related-to-hazardous-waste-management>How is CERCLA related to hazardous waste management?</h2>
<p>CERCLA addresses historic releases of hazardous materials, but does not specifically manage hazardous wastes. In the United States, the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste are regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).</p>
