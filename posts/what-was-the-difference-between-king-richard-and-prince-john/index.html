<h2 id=what-was-the-difference-between-king-richard-and-prince-john>What was the difference between King Richard and Prince John?</h2>
<p>John (24 December 1166 – 19 October 1216) was King of England from 1199 until his death in 1216. John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against the royal administrators of his brother, King Richard, whilst Richard was participating in the Third Crusade, but he was proclaimed king after Richard died in 1199.</p>
<h2 id=was-richard-the-lionheart-a-good-king>Was Richard the Lionheart a good king?</h2>
<p>All English school children learn about this great king who reigned from 1189-1199. He earned the title ‘Coeur-de-Lion’ or ‘Lion Heart’ as he was a brave soldier, a great crusader, and won many battles against Saladin, the leader of the Muslims who were occupying Jerusalem at that time.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-between-king-richard-and-king-john>What happened between King Richard and King John?</h2>
<p>When Richard was imprisoned on his return from the crusades, by Duke Leopold of Austria, John again conspired with the French King to seize the kingdom. On his deathbed Richard named John as his heir, although by the law of primogeniture Arthur, the son of an older brother, Geoffrey, should have succeeded him.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-richard-forgive-john>Why did Richard forgive John?</h2>
<p>Richard was let out and upon his return he forgave John, labeling him as ‘a child who had had bad councilors’. After all, he had been named king. John had a real threat to his succession as Arthur had a very good claim to the throne. In the end, John was crowned king.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-richard-the-1st-die>How did Richard the 1st die?</h2>
<p>In late March 1199, he laid siege to the castle at Châlus-Chabrol and was shot in the shoulder with an crossbow bolt. The wound turned gangrenous, and he died on 6 April 1199.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-difference-between-king-richard-and-king-john>What was the difference between King Richard and King John?</h2>
<p>Whereas Richard exhibited little interest in his responsibilities as a king, John (1199-1216) exhibited too much. A bad press over the years has portrayed him as a villain, and the sad truth is that John was really not a very good king. He was greedy, a poor administrator, and a poor warrior.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-heir-to-the-throne-after-king-richard>Who was the heir to the throne after King Richard?</h2>
<p>On his deathbed Richard named John as his heir, although by the law of primogeniture Arthur, the son of an older brother, Geoffrey, should have succeeded him. Thus, despite their rivalry, Richard and John conspired to keep the crown in the family, and John’s coronation took place at Westminster Abbey, on 27 May the same year.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-king-philip-do-with-king-john>What did King Philip do with King John?</h2>
<p>Richard and the French king had lots of fun and while Richard stayed to stick it to the Saracens a bit longer and harder, Philip came home to France early. When he got back, John and Philip discussed an alliance that came to fruition when Richard was captured and held for ransom on his way home from crusade.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-king-john-criticized-by-his-brothers>Why was King John criticized by his brothers?</h2>
<p>Warren can’t help but point out that at an age when his brothers Richard and Geoffrey were stamping their authority on Aquitaine and Brittany, John had squandered his opportunities in Ireland. The criticism is reasonably justified, but to understand why, we need to look at his upbringing.</p>
