<h2 id=how-often-does-it-rain-on-mt-fuji>How often does it rain on Mt. Fuji?</h2>
<p>Rain falls throughout the year in Fuji. The most rain falls during the 31 days centered around June 29, with an average total accumulation of 8.0 inches. The least rain falls around December 30, with an average total accumulation of 1.8 inches.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-snow-melt-on-the-matterhorn>When does the snow melt on the Matterhorn?</h2>
<p>Fortunately, in the middle of summer, the sun on the east face is quite warm, and if the weather is good vast amounts of snow can melt quite quickly. But it needs warm sunshine, and relatively little wind to reach these high snow-melting temperatures. Typically, the first really warm days arrive sometime in June.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-matterhorn-in-the-alps>How tall is the Matterhorn in the Alps?</h2>
<p>The Matterhorn is a mountain in the Alps which sits on the border between Switzerland and Italy. It stands at an impressive 14,700 feet (4,478 m). The Matterhorn was first referred to in writing as ‘Mont Cervin’ in 1581, and later also as ‘Monte Silvio’ and ‘Monte Servino’.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-climb-matterhorn>When is the best time to climb Matterhorn?</h2>
<p>In general, on the Matterhorn, the best and safest conditions are when the route is reasonably free of snow up to the Shoulder. Because the peak is so tall, even in mid-summer it can receive lots of new snow. And we have to wait for this to melt in order for it to come into condition.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-people-turn-back-from-matterhorn>How often do people turn back from Matterhorn?</h2>
<p>Roughly 3,500 people tackle the Matterhorn without a guide each year; some 65 per cent turn back en route, usually because of lack of fitness or an insufficient head for heights. Last month, scientists installed 50 movement sensors at 13,000ft (3,962m) to give updates to the mountain’s guides to help them assess the likelihood of rock fall.</p>
