<h2 id=who-was-marco-polo-what-did-he-do-and-why-is-he-so-important>Who was Marco Polo what did he do and why is he so important?</h2>
<p>Marco Polo was a Venetian explorer known for the book The Travels of Marco Polo, which describes his voyage to and experiences in Asia. Polo traveled extensively with his family, journeying from Europe to Asia from 1271 to 1295 and remaining in China for 17 of those years.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-marco-polo-in-history>Who was Marco Polo in history?</h2>
<p>Marco Polo (1254-1324) was a Venetian merchant believed to have journeyed across Asia at the height of the Mongol Empire. He first set out at age 17 with his father and uncle, traveling overland along what later became known as the Silk Road.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-marco-polo-say-in-his-book>What did Marco Polo say in his book?</h2>
<p>He was imprisoned, and met Rustichello, who was a writer and helped him to write the book, ‘The Travels of Marco Polo’, which was originally known as ‘The Description of The World’. Marco’s thoughts on travel, culture are purely based out of his life and experiences. We have gathered few of his sayings from his book and life.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-marco-polo-get-favor-in-china>How did Marco Polo get favor in China?</h2>
<p>In China, the Polos were well received by Kublai khan. As Marco Polo immersed himself in Chinese culture, and was a gifted linguist, he quickly gained favor with the Great Khan. As a result, he was appointed as a special envoy of the Yuan court. This enabled him to travel to various parts of Asia such as Tibet, Burma and India.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-marco-polo-born-and-when-did-he-die>When was Marco Polo born and when did he die?</h2>
<p>Written By: Marco Polo, (born c. 1254, Venice [Italy]—died January 8, 1324, Venice), Venetian merchant and adventurer who traveled from Europe to Asia in 1271–95, remaining in China for 17 of those years, and whose Il milione (“The Million”), known in English as the Travels of Marco Polo, is a classic of travel literature.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-marco-polos-il-milione>What was the impact of Marco Polo’s Il Milione?</h2>
<p>Marco Polo’s account in Il milione opened new vistas to the European mind, and, as Western horizons expanded, Polo’s legacy grew as well. The wealth of new geographic information recorded by Polo was widely used in the late 15th and the 16th centuries, during the age of the great European voyages of discovery and conquest.</p>
