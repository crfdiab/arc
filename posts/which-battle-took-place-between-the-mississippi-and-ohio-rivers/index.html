<h2 id=which-battle-took-place-between-the-mississippi-and-ohio-rivers>Which battle took place between the Mississippi and Ohio rivers?</h2>
<p>Battle of Fallen Timbers: August 20, 1794 The fighting took place on the Maumee River, near present-day Toledo. With the Treaty of Greenville, signed in present-day Greenville, Ohio, in August 1795, the Indians ceded much of present-day Ohio, which, in 1803, became America’s 17th state.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-mississippi-river-used-for-in-the-civil-war>What was the Mississippi River used for in the Civil War?</h2>
<p>The Lower Mississippi River Valley was the most critical theater of the Civil War. The Mississippi River served as the major interstate highway of 19th-century America. The river enabled people to transport goods from St. Louis and Pittsburgh through New Orleans to the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-mississippi-river-important-to-both-sides-in-the-war>Why was the Mississippi River important to both sides in the war?</h2>
<p>Control of the Mississippi River during the American Civil War was an economic and psychological factor for both the North and the South. For many years, the river had served as a vital waterway for mid-western farmers shipping their goods to the eastern states by way of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-ohio-river-a-tributary-of-the-mississippi-river>Is the Ohio River a tributary of the Mississippi River?</h2>
<p>The Ohio River becomes a tributary of the Mississippi River directly south of Cairo, Illinois, a small city on the spit of land where the rivers converge (at center of this astronaut photograph).</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-name-ohio-river-come-from>Where does the name Ohio River come from?</h2>
<p>It is one of the tributaries of the Mississippi River which is popular for being the river’s largest tributary by volume. The word “Ohio” originated from the Seneca language of the Seneca people. It means “Good River.”</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-ohio-and-mississippi-rivers-brown>Why are the Ohio and Mississippi rivers brown?</h2>
<p>The color of the rivers in this image is reversed from the usual condition of a green Ohio and a brown Mississippi. This suggests that the very high rainfall in December 2005 over the Appalachians and the northeastern United States has led to greater-than-normal amounts of sediment in the rivers and streams of the Ohio River watershed.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-allegheny-river-and-the-ohio-river-converge>Where does the Allegheny River and the Ohio River converge?</h2>
<p>The Allegheny River is at an elevation of 2,240 feet. On the other hand, the Monongahela River sits at an elevation of 880 feet. These two rivers converge at Point State Park in Pittsburgh which is situated in Pennsylvania resulting in the formation of the Ohio River.</p>
