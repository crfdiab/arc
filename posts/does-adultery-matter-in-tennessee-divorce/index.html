<h2 id=does-adultery-matter-in-tennessee-divorce>Does adultery matter in Tennessee divorce?</h2>
<p>Tennessee defines adultery as voluntary sexual intercourse with a person other than your spouse. Some states have pure “no-fault” divorces and will not consider either spouse’s adultery during a divorce. In Tennessee however, courts can consider which spouse’s conduct caused a divorce, including a spouse’s infidelity.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-divorce-take-in-tn>How long does divorce take in TN?</h2>
<p>How long does a divorce take? A mutual-consent, no-fault divorce takes about two to six months. If there are no children in the marriage, there is a mandatory 60-day “cooling-off” period after the spouse files the complaint. If the couple has children, it takes a minimum of 90 days.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-same-sex-marriage-become-legal-in-tennessee>When did same sex marriage become legal in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>Degree of recognition unknown. No actual cases to date. Same-sex marriage in the U.S. state of Tennessee became legal with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges on June 26, 2015. That day, Governor Bill Haslam announced the state would follow the judicial order, and same-sex couples began to marry in Tennessee. 1.4.1 Tanco v.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-same-sex-marriage-be-recognized-by-the-irs>Can a same sex marriage be recognized by the IRS?</h2>
<p>The IRS has a general rule recognizing a marriage of same-sex spouses that was validly entered into in a domestic or foreign jurisdiction whose laws authorize the marriage of two individuals of the same sex even if the married couple resides in a domestic or foreign jurisdiction that does not recognize the validity of same-sex marriages. Q2.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-complications-with-a-same-sex-divorce>Are there any complications with a same sex divorce?</h2>
<p>Same-sex divorce poses complications for some splitting couples. The legal date of a same-sex marriage might not accurately reflect how long the relationship has lasted. In some cases, parental rights are not clear-cut. Mediation, which tends to be less costly and more flexible, can be a better option than litigating a divorce.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-supreme-court-allow-same-sex-marriage>Why did the Supreme Court allow same sex marriage?</h2>
<p>Two years after the U.S. Supreme Court leagalized same-sex marriages, some couples who decide to call it quits are discovering that getting married was the easy part. From divvying up assets to asserting parental rights, the details of divorce that can be more clear-cut with heterosexual marriages are creating complications for same-sex couples.</p>
