<h2 id=who-is-older-bonifacio-or-rizal>Who is older Bonifacio or Rizal?</h2>
<p>BORN ON November 30, 1863, Andres Bonifacio y de Castro, founder and later the ‘Supremo’ (supreme leader) of the Katipunan, was two-year younger than Jose Rizal. When his parents died of sickness, Andres stopped attending school to support his siblings.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-jose-rizal-different>What makes Jose Rizal different?</h2>
<p>Jose Rizal is, in the annals of heroism, an anomaly. He was a man of science, a scholar and writer, and to many young Filipinos is idealized as a model son and something of a ladies’ man. Unlike other national heroes, he did not bear arms or lead an army.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-comparisons-between-rizal-and-bonifacio>What are comparisons between Rizal and Bonifacio?</h2>
<p>What Are Comparisons Between Rizal and Bonifacio? Though they differed in their approach to achieving national pride, reform and independence, Jose Rizal and Andres Bonifacio are both highly regarded as Philippine heroes.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-not-much-known-about-andres-rizal>Why is not much known about Andres Rizal?</h2>
<p>Another reason why not much is known about Andres compared to Rizal that is not addressed in the article is that Rizal was a sort of genius who stood out early in life and caught the attention of everyone. He was also a prolific writer. And his contemporaries all considered him the leader of the revolution. So his life is well documented.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-real-national-hero--rizal-or-bonifacio>Who is the real national hero – Rizal or Bonifacio?</h2>
<p>Who is the real National Hero–Rizal or Bonifacio? Our national hero is Jose Rizal. From high school to college we were taught to read and discuss about the life and works of Rizal who lived during the 19th century.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-rizal-put-up-the-up-oblation>Why did Rizal put up the UP Oblation?</h2>
<p>The UP oblation does appear to symbolize Andres Bonifacio. It was inspired by 2 stanzas in Rizal’s Mi Ultimo Adios (My Last Farewell) which calls for militant and selfless sacrifice and service to the country. The verses particularly mention fighting in battlefields… And Andres was the young man who answered Rizal’s call.</p>
