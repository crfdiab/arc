<h2 id=when-did-britain-take-control-of-nova-scotia>When did Britain take control of Nova Scotia?</h2>
<p>1848<br>
In 1848 Nova Scotia became the first British colony in which the administration of government was responsible to the majority in the House of Assembly, the representative branch of colonial government.</p>
<h2 id=does-nova-scotia-mean-new-scotland>Does Nova Scotia mean new Scotland?</h2>
<p>Nova Scotia is Latin for “New Scotland”. The province was named by Sir William Alexander who was given the land by King James VI of Scotland in 1621.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-owns-nova-scotia>What country owns Nova Scotia?</h2>
<p>Dominion of Canada<br>
Nova Scotia, Canadian province located on the eastern seaboard of North America, one of the four original provinces (along with New Brunswick, Ontario, and Quebec) that constituted the Dominion of Canada in 1867.</p>
<h2 id=is-chester-nova-scotia-a-nice-place-to-live>Is Chester Nova Scotia a nice place to live?</h2>
<p>Nova Scotia’s seaside community of Chester – known for its sailing, arts and culture, and beautiful ocean views that attract visitors every summer – has been ranked the second worst place to live in Canada, leaving some residents scratching their heads.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-minimum-wage-in-nova-scotia>What is minimum wage in Nova Scotia?</h2>
<p>$12.95 an<br>
Nova Scotia’s minimum wage is set to increase by 40 cents to $12.95 an hour on April 1.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-nova-scotia-become-a-british-colony>When did Nova Scotia become a British colony?</h2>
<p>During the American Revolutionary War, thousands of Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia. In 1848, Nova Scotia became the first British colony to achieve responsible government, and it federated in July 1867 with New Brunswick and the Province of Canada (now Ontario and Quebec) to form what is now the country of Canada.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-black-settlers-leave-nova-scotia>When did the black settlers leave Nova Scotia?</h2>
<p>In 1792, approximately 1,192 Black Nova Scotian settlers left Halifax, Nova Scotia and immigrated to Sierra Leone. The majority of free blacks did remain in Nova Scotia and made communities.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-scottish-immigrants-related-to-nova-scotia>How are Scottish immigrants related to Nova Scotia?</h2>
<p>The large migration of Scots during the 18th and 19th century show how, even though Scotland was now part of Great Britain, Nova Scotia was still influenced strongly by Scotland. Even today Nova Scotia still has a large portion of people who identify as Scottish Canadians, and are in some way related to Scottish immigrants.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-problem-for-the-colonist-of-nova-scotia>What was the first problem for the colonist of Nova Scotia?</h2>
<p>The first problem encountered was the dense forests of the region; the land had to be cleared before proper buildings could be erected. With the first winter approaching, many of the new settlers died of illness. Those that survived continued to suffer, as their homes were poorly constructed and many soon left.</p>
