<p>What Can I Do If I Can’t Afford a New Roof?</p>
<ol>
<li>Options to Consider.</li>
<li>Finance Repair Costs. If you can’t afford repairs on your roof, there are several financing options available to help you.</li>
<li>Apply for a Grant.</li>
<li>Reach out to Your Network.</li>
<li>Refinance Your Home.</li>
<li>Save the Money.</li>
<li>The Roof Doctor is an Affordable Option.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-is-the-cheapest-roof-to-build>What is the cheapest roof to build?</h2>
<p>Asphalt shingles are the cheapest roofing material at $100 to $150 per square.</p>
<h2 id=are-50-year-shingles-worth-the-money>Are 50 year shingles worth the money?</h2>
<p>Even so, these could last you between 25 to 40 years at most until you’ll need a roof replacement. If your plan is to live in your home for the next 5 to 6 decades, 50-year shingles are worth the investment. If not, you might want to consider cheaper, alternative options.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-price-to-tear-off-and-replace-a-roof>What’s the average price to tear off and replace a roof?</h2>
<p>What’s The Average Cost To Tear-off and Replace A Roof? The average cost of a roof installation will vary quite a bit. The typical range is somewhere between $5,100 and $10,000, but again, these prices can vary a lot. A replacement could be as low as $1,200 or as high as $30,000.</p>
<h2 id=will-my-insurance-go-up-if-i-replace-my-roof>Will my insurance go up if I replace my roof?</h2>
<p>On average, insurance providers may discount your policy by 20 percent for completely replacing your roof, which could save you hundreds of dollars a year.</p>
<h2 id=will-homeowners-insurance-pay-for-a-new-roof>Will homeowners insurance pay for a new roof?</h2>
<p>Most homeowners insurance policies cover roof replacement if the damage is the result of an act of nature or sudden accidental event. Most homeowners insurance policies won’t pay to replace or repair a roof that’s gradually deteriorating due to wear-and-tear or neglect.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-ok-to-put-a-metal-roof-over-shingles>Is it OK to put a metal roof over shingles?</h2>
<p>In almost every case, the answer is yes, you can lay down a new metal roof over an existing shingle roof. This is one of the many reasons metal roofs keep growing in popularity – their installation doesn’t require completely tearing off the existing roof, which is a time-consuming and expensive job.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-easiest-roof-to-build>What is the easiest roof to build?</h2>
<p>gable roof<br>
The easiest style of roof to build is a gable roof. It only has one ridge cap and is less prone to leaks than a bunch of hips and valleys.</p>
