With colonialism, which began in South Africa in 1652, came the Slavery and Forced Labour Model. This was the original model of colonialism brought by the Dutch in 1652, and subsequently exported from the Western Cape to the Afrikaner Republics of the Orange Free State and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek.</p>

<p>May 31, 1910<br>
On May 31, 1910, four colonies were joined together to create the Union of South Africa, a self-governing Dominion in the British Empire. While the new nation was sovereign when it came to its domestic affairs, the United Kingdom maintained control over its relations with the wider world.</p>

<p>The two European countries who occupied the land were the Netherlands (1652–1795 and 1803–1806) and Great Britain (1795–1803 and 1806–1961). Although South Africa became a Union with its own white people government in 1910, the country was still regarded as a colony of Britain till 1961.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-original-people-of-south-africa-live>Where did the original people of South Africa live?</h2>
<p>The advancing Bantu encroached on the Khoikhoi territory, forcing the original inhabitants of the region to move to more arid areas. Some of the migrant groups, ancestral to today’s Nguni peoples (the Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, and Ndebele ), preferred to live near the eastern coast of what is present-day South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-south-africa-become-part-of-the-british-empire>When did South Africa become part of the British Empire?</h2>
<p>Following the defeat of the Boers in the Anglo-Boer or South African War (1899–1902), the Union of South Africa was created as a dominion of the British Empire in terms of the South Africa Act 1909, which amalgamated the four previously separate British colonies: Cape Colony, Natal Colony, Transvaal Colony, and Orange River Colony.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-south-africa-accepted-in-the-world>How is South Africa accepted in the world?</h2>
