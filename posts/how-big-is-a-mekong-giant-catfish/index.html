<h2 id=how-big-is-a-mekong-giant-catfish>How big is a Mekong giant catfish?</h2>
<p>9.8 ft<br>
Attaining an unconfirmed length of 3 m (9.8 ft), the Mekong giant catfish grows extremely quickly, reaching a mass of 150 to 200 kg (330 to 440 lb) in six years. It can reportedly weigh up to 350 kg (770 lb).</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-biggest-catfish-ever-caught>How big was the biggest catfish ever caught?</h2>
<p>Thai fishermen caught a 646-pound catfish believed to have been the world’s largest freshwater fish ever recorded, a researcher said Thursday. The 8.9 foot long Mekong giant catfish was the heaviest recorded fish since Thailand started keeping records in 1981.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-catfish-caught-in-the-mississippi-river>What is the biggest catfish caught in the Mississippi River?</h2>
<p>101 pound blue catfish<br>
(WSIL) — The Missouri Department of Conservation is highlighting a large fish recently caught on the Mississippi River. Carey Branham and his fishing pal Greg Branham, both of Farmington, caught a 101 pound blue catfish. This was the biggest catfish Carey has ever caught.</p>
<h2 id=do-mekong-giant-catfish-eat-humans>Do Mekong giant catfish eat humans?</h2>
<p>No, despite what you may have heard, there aren’t. This is a myth, along with age-old claims that giant anacondas or piranhas eat men. In October 2008 another large catfish was caught in the Great Kali river, between India and Nepal, and it was claimed to have started eating swimmers.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-mekong-giant-catfish-are-left>How many Mekong giant catfish are left?</h2>
<p>The Mekong giant catfish is the largest freshwater fish, a species endemic to the Mekong River that migrates huge distances to spawn. Scientists estimate that the total population of Mekong giant catfish has decreased by around 90% in the last decade, with potentially only a few 100 individuals remaining.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-chernobyl-catfish-so-big>Why are Chernobyl catfish so big?</h2>
<p>It may sound pretty crazy and dangerous, but don’t worry, these 50 to 70 kilos weighing catfish are huge not because of the radiation, but because there are no more predators that can hunt them down, so they grow up to unnatural sizes.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-catfish-kill-you>Can a catfish kill you?</h2>
<p>Some in North America can inflict a sting that humans notice. Elsewhere in the world, a few catfish species can even kill humans. Catfish venom poisons a victim’s nerves and breaks down red blood cells, producing such effects as severe pain, reduced blood flow, muscle spasms and respiratory distress.</p>
<h2 id=what-fish-will-eat-humans>What fish will eat humans?</h2>
<p>Piranhas<br>
Piranhas do have very sharp teeth and powerful jaws, with a study in 2012 indicating that the black piranha has the strongest bite found in a living fish. They will eat almost anything when hungry – and there have been fatal attacks on humans, including a six-year-old girl in Brazil three years ago.</p>
<h2 id=what-fish-has-killed-the-most-humans>What fish has killed the most humans?</h2>
<p>stonefish<br>
Of the estimated 1,200 venomous fish species on Earth, the stonefish is the most lethal – with enough toxin to kill an adult human in under an hour.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-the-736-pound-mekong-catfish>How old was the 736 pound Mekong catfish?</h2>
<p>Origin. Although most simply enjoy telling their version of the story, many claim to have actually seen it, yet some never believed it to be true. The catfish weighed in at 736 lbs. Experts say the fish, a Mekong giant catfish, was around 170 years old and never seen in this part of the world.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-biggest-fish-in-the-mekong-river>Which is the biggest fish in the Mekong River?</h2>
<p>Among the fish species in the Mekong River, the Mekong giant catfish (scientific name: Pangasianodon gigas) is the biggest.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-jeremy-wade-catch-the-mekong-giant-catfish>How did Jeremy Wade catch the Mekong giant catfish?</h2>
<p>The Mekong Giant Catfish is caught by accident in the River Monsters episodes ” Death Ray “, ” Asian Slayer “, and ” Mekong Mutilator “. In the latter two cases, Jeremy Wade has considerable trouble bringing them in, and, in the former case, the fish was fairly small for its species.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-does-a-mekong-giant-catfish-eat>What kind of food does a Mekong giant catfish eat?</h2>
<p>As fry, this species feeds on zooplankton in the river and is known to be cannibalistic. After approximately one year, the fish becomes herbivorous, feeding on filamentous algae, probably ingesting larvae and periphyton accidentally.</p>
