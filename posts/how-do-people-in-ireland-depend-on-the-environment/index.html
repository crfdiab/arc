<h2 id=how-do-people-in-ireland-depend-on-the-environment>How do people in Ireland depend on the environment?</h2>
<p>i. Humans Depend on the Environment: The humans depend on fresh air, clean water, trees,and other plants, turf, natural gas, wind. Back when Ireland was a poor country they depended on certain vegetables to grow and buy. Most Irish people had This meal everyday.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-5-themes-of-geography-applied>How are the 5 themes of geography applied?</h2>
<p>The Five Themes are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Location: Position on the Earth’s Surface (Absolute/Relative).</li>
<li>Place: Physical and Human Characteristics.</li>
<li>Human/Environment Interactions: Shaping the Landscape.</li>
<li>Movement: Humans Interacting on the Earth.</li>
<li>Regions: How They Form and Change.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-geographical-features-of-ireland>What are the main geographical features of Ireland?</h2>
<p>The island’s main geographical features include low central plains surrounded by coastal mountains. The highest peak is Carrauntoohil (Irish: Corrán Tuathail), which is 1,041 meters (3,415 ft) above sea level. The western coastline is rugged, with many islands, peninsulas, headlands and bays.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-physical-geography-of-ireland>What is the physical geography of Ireland?</h2>
<p>The main geographical features of Ireland are low central plains surrounded by a ring of coastal mountains. The highest peak is Carrauntuohill ( Irish: Corrán Tuathail), which is 1041 m (3414 ft). There are a number of sizable lakes along Ireland’s rivers, with Lough Neagh the largest in either Britain or Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-five-main-themes-of-geography>What are the five main themes of geography?</h2>
<p>Updated August 29, 2018. The five themes of geography are location, place, human-environment interaction, movement, and region. They were created in 1984 by the National Council for Geographic Education and the Association of American Geographers to facilitate and organize the teaching of geography in the K-12 classroom.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-feature-of-geography>Which is an example of a feature of geography?</h2>
<p>These features include land use, architectural styles, forms of livelihood, religious practices, political systems, common foods, local folklore, means of transportation, and methods of communication. For example, a location could be described as a technologically advanced French-speaking democracy with a Catholic majority.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-a-topographical-map-an-example-of-geography>How is a topographical map an example of geography?</h2>
<p>If a place is described as hot, sandy, fertile, or forested, these terms all paint a picture of the physical characteristics of the location. A topographical map is one tool used to illustrate the physical characteristics of a location.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-movement-in-geography>Which is an example of movement in geography?</h2>
<p>The emigration of Syrians during war, the flow of water in the Gulf Stream, and the expansion of cell phone reception around the planet are all examples of movement. Regions divide the world into manageable units for geographic study. Regions have some sort of characteristic that unifies the area and can be formal, functional, or vernacular.</p>
