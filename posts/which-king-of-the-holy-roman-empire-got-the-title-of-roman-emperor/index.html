<p>king Charlemagne Emperor<br>
In 800, Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne Emperor of the Romans, reviving the title in Western Europe after more than three centuries.</p>

<p>Charlemagne<br>
How did Charlemagne become emperor of the Holy Roman Empire? Charlemagne was crowned “emperor of the Romans” by Pope Leo III in 800 CE, thus restoring the Roman Empire in the West for the first time since its dissolution in the 5th century.</p>
<h2 id=who-chose-the-holy-roman-emperor>Who chose the Holy Roman Emperor?</h2>
<p>the Pope<br>
The election of a Holy Roman Emperor was generally a two-stage process whereby, from at least the 13th century, the King of the Romans was elected by a small body of the greatest princes of the Empire, the prince-electors. This was then followed shortly thereafter by his coronation as Emperor by the Pope.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-does-the-holy-roman-emperor-get-the-title>How is does the Holy Roman Emperor get the title?</h2>
<p>The first “Holy Roman Emperor” is Charlemagne, who was king of the Franks from 768-814. He received the title after Pope Leo the third named the Frankish kingdom,the Holy Roman emperor. The Holy Roman Empire did not live up to it’s name.</p>
<h2 id=what-powers-did-the-holy-roman-emperor-have>What powers did the Holy Roman Emperor have?</h2>
<p>The emperor only formally exercised supreme power. In practice, he only acted as arbiter in the Imperial Diet, the highest juridical power in the empire.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-the-holy-roman-empire>Who was the king of the Holy Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>“We, Francis II, by the grace of God elected Roman Emperor, at all times Increaser of the Realm, hereditary Emperor of Austria, King in Germania, in Jerusalem, in Hungary, in Bohemia […]. The Holy Roman Empire was an elective monarchy. No person had a legal right to the succession simply because he was related to the current Emperor.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-last-emperor-of-the-holy-roman-empire>Who was the last emperor of the Holy Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>Charles V was the last emperor to be crowned by the pope, and his successor, Ferdinand I, merely adopted the title of “Emperor elect” in 1558. The final Holy Roman Emperor-elect, Francis II, abdicated in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars that saw the Empire’s final dissolution.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-emperor-of-rome-in-962>Who was the emperor of Rome in 962?</h2>
<p>Otto I was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope John XII on February 2nd 962.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-otto-the-great-become-the-holy-roman-emperor>When did Otto the Great become the Holy Roman Emperor?</h2>
<p>The comparatively brief interregnum between 924 and the coronation of Otto the Great in 962 is taken as marking the transition from the Frankish Empire to the Holy Roman Empire. Under the Ottonians, much of the former Carolingian kingdom of Eastern Francia fell within the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>
