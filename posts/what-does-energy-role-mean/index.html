<h2 id=what-does-energy-role-mean>What does energy role mean?</h2>
<p>An energy role is how an organism obtains its energy and how it interacts with other living things in its community.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-roles-of-plants-in-the-energy-flow-in-the-ecosystem>What are the roles of plants in the energy flow in the ecosystem?</h2>
<p>The energy flow in the ecosystem is important to maintain an ecological balance. The producers synthesise food by the process of photosynthesis. The remaining energy is utilised by the plants in their growth and development. This stored energy is transferred to the primary consumers when they feed on the producers.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-energy-go>Where does the energy go?</h2>
<p>A: That light energy will be absorbed and converted to heat. Then it will radiate out into space as infrared thermal radiation. It will travel in that form for a long time, once it gets out of the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-decomposers-gain-energy>How do decomposers gain energy?</h2>
<p>Scavengers and decomposers get their energy by eating dead plants or animals. The nutrients that decomposers release into the environment become part of the soil, making it fertile and good for plant growth. These nutrients become a part of new plants that grow from the fertile soil.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-sources-of-energy-in-the-body>What are the main sources of energy in the body?</h2>
<p>Carbohydrate and fat are the primary sources of energy, with protein contributing a minimal amount under normal conditions. Adenosine triphospate (ATP) is the body’s usable form of energy. The body uses 3 different systems of metabolism to transfer stored energy to form ATP.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-concentrated-source-of-energy-in-food>Which is the most concentrated source of energy in food?</h2>
<p>These are the most concentrated source of energy in food. Sources of Fats Animal products like meat, poultry and dairy products like milk, cream, cheese, butter and ice-cream, peanuts, olive oil etc. Types Fats can be classified according to their structures.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-plants-used-as-sources-of-energy>How are plants used as sources of energy?</h2>
<p>The plants fix solar energy through the process of photosynthesis to produce biomass. This biomass passes through various cycles producing different forms of energy sources. For example, fodder for animals that in turn produce dung, agricultural waste for cooking, etc.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-reliable-source-of-energy>Which is the most reliable source of energy?</h2>
<p>Sources of Energy. 1 Solar Energy. Sun is the primary source of energy. Sunlight is a clean, renewable source of energy. It is a sustainable resource, meaning it doesn’t 2 Wind Energy. 3 Biomass and Biofuels. 4 Water and geothermal.</p>
