<h2 id=was-shi-huangdi-a-good-or-bad-emperor>Was Shi Huangdi a good or bad emperor?</h2>
<p>Yes, Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi was an effective leader because he helped form China. He was the first Emperor of China, and helped form it into the country it is today. He built many new things to help China improve throughout his reign. He did many good and bad things, but was a very effective leader.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-positive-about-shi-huangdi-rule>What was positive about Shi Huangdi rule?</h2>
<p>Under Shi Huangdi’s rule, irrigation projects increased farm production. Trade blossomed and a new middle class developed. Despite these social advantages, harsh taxes and repressive government made the Qin regime unpopular. Shi Huangdi had unified China at the expense of human freedom.</p>
<h2 id=why-shi-huangdi-was-a-bad-emperor>Why Shi Huangdi was a bad emperor?</h2>
<p>Shi Huangdi was a bad ruler because he killed many people, burned history and literature books, and sent his own son into exile. Regardless of his few accomplishments for China, his reign was a one of fear and intimidation for the people.</p>
<h2 id=what-advantages-did-qin-have>What advantages did Qin have?</h2>
<p>Since Qin had unified China it allows all the other states to prosper and work together to achieve a common goal. This also allows there to be more efficiency in the country as states don’t need to trade between each other as now China is one country.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-bad-things-about-qin-shi-huang>What are some bad things about Qin Shi Huang?</h2>
<p>He greatly weakened the teachers and scholars: Censorship was introduced. Qin burned what he called useless books. If a book was not about agriculture, medicine, or prophecy, it was burned. Scholars who refused to allow their books to be burned where either burned alive or sent to work on the wall.</p>

<h2 id=do-you-think-that-qin-shihuang-was-a-good-ruler>Do you think that Qin Shihuang was a good ruler?</h2>
<p>4026Reply He should be a good ruler, because his achievements are much more than his defects. good ruler Qin shihuang was good and bad . good good ruler =) Shi Huangdi was mainly bad; he was big on censorship and legalism (the belief the everyone is born evil, so strict laws must be in place).</p>

<p>Qin shihuang was good and bad . Shi Huangdi was mainly bad; he was big on censorship and legalism (the belief the everyone is born evil, so strict laws must be in place). He also would burn books, and bury scholars alive, going along with the censorship. He did help China in some ways, as most leaders do.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-bad-ruler-of-the-qin-dynasty>Who was the bad ruler of the Qin dynasty?</h2>
<p>Shi Huangdi Was A Bad Ruler. Shi Huangdi was a powerful Chinese ruler during the Qin dynasty. I feel that he was a bad ruler for a few reasons. He killed many people, burned history and literature books, and he sent his own son into exile.</p>
