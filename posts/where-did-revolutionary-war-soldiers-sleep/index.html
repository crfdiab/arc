<h2 id=where-did-revolutionary-war-soldiers-sleep>Where did Revolutionary War soldiers sleep?</h2>
<p>Where did the Soldiers Stay? The soldiers stayed in camps where they held thousands of them and it was tightly packed. The soldiers slept in tents which protected them form rain and cold. The size of the tent you slept in depended on your rank.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-continental-army-sleep>Where did the Continental Army sleep?</h2>
<p>Cold, hunger, and sickness marked the Continental Army’s stay at Valley Forge in Pennsylvania. Today, Valley Forge’s wide fields are dotted with revolutionary relics, reminders of the brutal winter endured by Washington’s troops. American spirits reached a low point during the harsh winter of 1777-78.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-men-were-sleep-in-each-hut>How many men were sleep in each hut?</h2>
<p>A squad of up to 12 soldiers slept in each enlisted hut.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-shelter-did-the-soldiers-build-at-valley-forge>What type of shelter did the soldiers build at Valley Forge?</h2>
<p>log shelters<br>
One of the most immediate remedies against the weather and a lack of clothing was the construction of log shelters by the men. Valley Forge was the first winter encampment where many thousands of men had to build their own huts.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-soldiers-in-the-revolutionary-war>What was life like for soldiers in the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>During the Revolutionary War more soldiers died from disease than from combat. Soldiers had a poor diet, worn out clothes, damp shelters, and lived in unsanitary conditions. Diseases such as smallpox and typhus killed thousands of soldiers. Hospitals and medicine were not very good at this time in history.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-confederate-soldiers-sleep-during-the-civil-war>Where did Confederate soldiers sleep during the Civil War?</h2>
<p>The confederate soldiers slept on rugs, and homemade pillows.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-soldiers-sleep-in-an-active-war-zone>Where do soldiers sleep in an active war zone?</h2>
<p>As you can see, we slept on cots, though some people bought crappy foam mattresses on the market and built beds out of wood framing. We crammed typically 5-8 guys in a room, depending on whether team leaders and squad leaders had their own rooms.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-soldiers-of-the-american-revolution-wear>What did the soldiers of the American Revolution wear?</h2>
<p>The soldiers clothing were made of wool, which was terrible to wear during the brutally cold winters and the smoldering hot summers. This showed in the Battle at Valley Forge where thousands of soldiers died of hypothermia and starvation before the fighting even began [1].</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-continental-army-during-the-revolutionary-war>Who was the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>During the war, Continental soldiers were the core of the American Revolutionary war effort. These were the men that General Washington and Congress depended most upon. Congress raised the Continental army by calling on the individual states to organize regiments of soldiers. North Carolina was asked to raise two regiments of five hundred men each.</p>
