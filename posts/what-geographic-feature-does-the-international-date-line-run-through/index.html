<h2 id=what-geographic-feature-does-the-international-date-line-run-through>What geographic feature does the International Date Line run through?</h2>
<p>The International Date Line, established in 1884, passes through the mid-Pacific Ocean and roughly follows a 180 degrees longitude north-south line on the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-equator-and-international-date-line-meet>Where does the equator and International Date Line meet?</h2>
<p>The IDL remains on the 180° meridian until passing the equator. Two US-owned uninhabited atolls, Howland Island and Baker Island, just north of the equator in the central Pacific Ocean (and ships at sea between 172.5°W and 180°), have the latest time on Earth (UTC−12:00 hours).</p>
<h2 id=what-country-does-the-international-date-line-go-through>What country does the International Date Line go through?</h2>
<p>The date line passes equidistantly between the two Diomede Islands—Little Diomede Island (US) and Big Diomede Island (Russia)—at a distance of 1.5 km (1 mi) from each island. The date line circumvents the territory of Kiribati by swinging far to the east, almost reaching the 150° meridian.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-longitude-and-time-and-the-international-date-line>What is the relationship between longitude and time and the International Date Line?</h2>
<p>The International Date Line is located halfway around the world from the prime meridian (0° longitude) or about 180° east (or west) of Greenwich, London, UK, the reference point of time zones.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-international-date-line-located-on-the-earth>Where is the International Date Line located on the Earth?</h2>
<p>The International Date Line (IDL) is an imaginary line of longitude on the Earth’s surface located at about 180 degrees east (or west) of the Greenwich Meridian.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-ireland-located-in-relation-to-the-uk>Where is Ireland located in relation to the UK?</h2>
<p>It is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean in the northwest; by the English Channel in the south; the North Sea in the east and the Celtic Sea in the southwest. Ireland is separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea. United Kingdom Bordering Countries : Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-date-line-in-the-island-of-the-day-before>What was the Date Line in the island of the day before?</h2>
<p>The date line is a central factor in Umberto Eco’s book The Island of the Day Before (1994), in which the protagonist finds himself on a becalmed ship, with an island close at hand on the other side of the IDL.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-united-kingdom-located-in-europe>Where is the United Kingdom located in Europe?</h2>
<p>United Kingdom Information: The United Kingdom is located in western Europe and consists of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean, The North Sea, and the Irish Sea. Explore United Kingdom Using Google Earth:</p>
