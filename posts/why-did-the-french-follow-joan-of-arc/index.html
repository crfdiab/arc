<h2 id=why-did-the-french-follow-joan-of-arc>Why did the French follow Joan of Arc?</h2>
<p>Joan of Arc, a peasant girl living in medieval France, believed that God had chosen her to lead France to victory in its long-running war with England.</p>
<h2 id=what-effect-does-joan-have-on-the-french-soldiers>What effect does Joan have on the French soldiers?</h2>
<p>Ironically, Joan’s victories had a similar effect: the French troops were starting to think they would always win, regardless of how hard they fought, and became complacent. Thus, Joan’s reputation came to be her undoing.</p>
<h2 id=what-military-strategies-did-joan-of-arc-use>What military strategies did Joan of Arc use?</h2>
<p>On May 8, the French were victorious, and the English retreated. Joan’s most significant battle strategies visible from the battle of Orleans was her clever entry of the city, ability to motivate her fellow soldiers, and tenacity to launch an assault (History).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-joan-of-arc-important-today>Why is Joan of Arc important today?</h2>
<p>Today, Joan of Arc is revered around the world. The Roman Catholic Church canonized her in 1920 and claimed her image as their own. Joan of Arc’s family expected her to marry and have a family. Constrained by both class and gender, Joan’s life consisted of church and farmwork.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-joan-of-arcs-weakness>What was Joan of Arc’s weakness?</h2>
<p>While Joan’s aggressive approach to war and her skill with artillery made her a formidable opponent, they were also her greatest weakness and led to her eventual capture. …</p>
<h2 id=what-did-joan-of-arc-want-to-do-with-her-life>What did Joan of Arc want to do with her life?</h2>
<p>Her objectives were to lift the siege at Orléans, crown Charles VII king in the city of Reims, and drive the English out of France. After the Catholic Church questioned her for three weeks and confirmed her virginity, the Dauphin believed her.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-joan-of-arc-win-the-battle-of-orleans>How did Joan of Arc win the Battle of Orleans?</h2>
<p>With no military training, Joan convinced the embattled crown prince Charles of Valois to allow her to lead a French army to the besieged city of Orléans, where it achieved a momentous victory over the English and their French allies, the Burgundians.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-joan-of-arcs-co-commander-in-the-army>Who was Joan of Arc’s co-commander in the Army?</h2>
<p>In the vague and imprecise military organization of late medieval France, Dunois and d’Alençon may be understood as Joan’s co-commanders of the army at war. Other witnesses were members of Joan’s personal entourage.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-joan-of-arc-executed-before-the-battle-of-castillon>Why was Joan of Arc executed before the Battle of Castillon?</h2>
<p>Not only was Joan executed 20 years before the final battle at Castillon, but several other important factors led to the eventual French victory. The period of the war was a transition period for France, as the country developed from a medieval feudal system to a modern state with a professional army.</p>
