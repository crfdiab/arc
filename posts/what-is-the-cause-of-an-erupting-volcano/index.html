<h2 id=what-is-the-cause-of-an-erupting-volcano>What is the cause of an erupting volcano?</h2>
<p>When enough magma builds up in the magma chamber, it forces its way up to the surface and erupts, often causing volcanic eruptions. Magma from Earth’s upper mantle rises up to fill these cracks. As the lava cools, it forms new crust on the edges of the cracks.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-a-volcano-all-of-a-sudden-erupt>Why does a volcano all of a sudden erupt?</h2>
<p>Explosive volcanic eruptions can be that powerful (Figure 8.9). As hot magma beneath the surface interacts with water, gases accumulate and the magma pressure builds up. This pressure grows and grows until these dissolved gases cause it to burst in an enormous explosion.</p>
<h2 id=what-happen-when-volcano-erupted>What happen when volcano erupted?</h2>
<p>A volcano is a vent in the Earth’s crust from which eruptions occur. There are about 1500 potentially active volcanoes worldwide. When volcanoes erupt they can spew hot, dangerous gases, ash, lava and rock that can cause disastrous loss of life and property, especially in heavily populated areas.</p>
<h2 id=can-volcanoes-make-lightning>Can volcanoes make lightning?</h2>
<p>During an explosive volcanic eruption, ash, rock, lava, and sometimes water collide, creating electrical charge in the eruption plume, and if the charge build up is high enough, lightning occurs.</p>
<h2 id=which-phrase-describes-a-volcano-that-is-not-expected-to-erupt-again>Which phrase describes a volcano that is not expected to erupt again?</h2>
<p>volcanoes which are not expected to erupt again is known as extinct volcanoes. Explanation: definition of extinct volcano: an extinct volcano has not had an eruption for at least 10,000 years and is not expected to erupt again in a comparable time scale of the future.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-largest-volcanic-eruption-in-history>What was the largest volcanic eruption in history?</h2>
<p>Mt Tambora<br>
Mt Tambora, Indonesia, 1815 (VEI 7) Mt. Tambora is the deadliest eruption in recent human history, claiming the lives of up to 120,000 people. On 10 April 1815, Tambora erupted sending volcanic ash 40km into the sky. It was the most powerful eruption in 500 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-people-affected-when-a-volcano-erupts>How are people affected when a volcano erupts?</h2>
<p>The explosivity of an eruption depends on the composition of the magma. If magma is thin and runny, gases can escape easily from it. When this type of magma erupts, it flows out of the volcano. A good example is the eruptions at Hawaii’s volcanoes. Lava flows rarely kill people because they move slowly enough for people to get out of their way.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-volcanoes-have-cracks-on-the-surface>Why do volcanoes have cracks on the surface?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, volcanoes have cracks on the surface that allow water to seep in and interact with magma. When this happens, hydrothermal alterations of rocks occur, resulting in eruptions. Where the magma exits the volcano is also important.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rock-does-a-volcano-erupt-from>What kind of rock does a volcano erupt from?</h2>
<p>When it is under the surface, the melted rock is known as magma and erupts as ash when it comes up. Rocks, lava and ash are built across the volcanic vent with every eruption. The nature of the eruption mainly depends on the viscosity of the magma. The lava travels far and generates broad shield volcanoes when it flows easily.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-some-volcanoes-dormant-for-a-long-time>Why are some volcanoes dormant for a long time?</h2>
<p>Why Are Some Volcanoes Dormant? If a volcano hasn’t erupted in some time, it’s dubbed as “dormant,” or inactive. Dormancy can happen whenever a volcano gets cut off from it’s magma source, such as when a tectonic plate shifts over a hotspot.</p>
