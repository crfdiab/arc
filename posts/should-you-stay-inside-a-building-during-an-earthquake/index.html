<h2 id=should-you-stay-inside-a-building-during-an-earthquake>Should you stay inside a building during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Stay inside if you are inside and outside if you are outside. Move away from buildings, utility wires, sinkholes, and fuel and gas lines. The greatest danger from falling debris is just outside doorways and close to outer walls of buildings. Go to an open area away from trees, telephone poles, and buildings.</p>
<h2 id=when-you-are-inside-the-building-during-earthquake-the-best-thing-to-do-is-to-go-out>When you are inside the building during earthquake the best thing to do is to go out?</h2>
<p>If you’re indoors, stand against a wall near the center of the building, stand in a doorway, or crawl under heavy furniture (a desk or table). Stay away from windows and outside doors. If you’re outdoors, stay in the open away from power lines or anything that might fall.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-go-outside-during-an-earthquake>Is it safe to go outside during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Stay inside. It can be tempting to run outside when an earthquake happens. After all, nothing can fall on you there. However, you likely won’t make it outside before things start falling, so it’s better to find a safe place inside than to try to make it outside. Turn off the stove and take other safety precautions.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-if-you-are-in-a-building-during-an-earthquake>What to do if you are in a building during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>If you are in a building, get beneath a sturdy table, cover your head, and hold on. Stay away from windows, mirrors, and large furniture. If the building is structurally unsound, get outside as fast as possible. If you are outside, run to an open area away from buildings and power lines that may fall.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-safest-place-to-work-during-an-earthquake>Where is the safest place to work during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>It should be out in the open away from buildings or powerlines. If there is no open space nearby, designate some other safe place. Set up a procedure to account for all employees. If there is a register assign some one to take this with them when evacuating the building.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-house-be-moved-during-an-earthquake>Can a house be moved during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Most modern buildings are built to withstand earthquakes, as they are built to flex. In older buildings, you may be slightly safer on a higher floor, but you shouldn’t try to move floors during an earthquake. A doorway isn’t the safest place in modern houses, as it isn’t any stronger than any other part of the house.</p>
