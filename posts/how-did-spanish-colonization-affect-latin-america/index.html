<h2 id=how-did-spanish-colonization-affect-latin-america>How did Spanish colonization affect Latin America?</h2>
<p>The Conquest and Colonization of Latin America. The Spanish conquest of Latin America brought many important changes to Latin American society. Native American populations had declined rapidly in parts of Latin America due to a lack of immunity to diseases brought by the conquerors like measles and smallpox.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-spanish-control-in-latin-america>What happened to Spanish control in Latin America?</h2>
<p>After three centuries of colonial rule, independence came rather suddenly to most of Spanish and Portuguese America. Between 1808 and 1826 all of Latin America except the Spanish colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico slipped out of the hands of the Iberian powers who had ruled the region since the conquest.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-the-spanish-colonizers-affect-the-indigenous-people>How did the Spanish colonizers affect the indigenous people?</h2>
