<h2 id=what-is-coastal-zone-pollution>What is coastal zone pollution?</h2>
<p>Over 80% of all marine pollution originates from land-based sources which are primarily industrial, agricultural and urban. Pollution accompanies most kinds of human activities, including offshore oil and gas production and marine oil transportation.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-of-worlds-coastline-is-affected-by-pollution>How much of world’s coastline is affected by pollution?</h2>
<p>269,000 tons float, 4 billion microfibers per km² dwell below the surface. 70% of our debris sinks into the ocean’s ecosystem, 15% floats, and 15% lands on our beaches. In terms of plastic, 8.3 million tons are discarded in the sea yearly.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-cause-of-coastal-pollution>What is the cause of coastal pollution?</h2>
<p>Pollution can enter the ocean directly. Sewage or polluting substances flow through sewage, rivers, or drainages directly into the ocean. This is often how minerals and substances from mining camps find their way into the ocean. As a result, all levels of oceanic life, plants and animals, are highly affected.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-human-activities-have-increased-coastal-pollution>What are the human activities have increased coastal pollution?</h2>
<h2 id=how-does-pollution-affect-the-environment-around-the-coast>How does pollution affect the environment around the coast?</h2>
<p>Coastal pollution has a negative impact on the environment around the coast. Some of the impacts of coastal pollution that have occurred are: 1. Damage to Mangrove Ecosystems and Coral Reefs</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-environmental-issues-in-the-coastal-zone>What are the environmental issues in the coastal zone?</h2>
<p>Environmental Science in the Coastal Zone: Issues for Further Research. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2249. nutrients accounted for 50 percent 1 of the total impaired area of estuaries; organic enrichment/low dissolved oxygen accounted for 29 percent of the total impaired area.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-sources-of-coastal-pollution>What are the main sources of coastal pollution?</h2>
<p>One source of pollution in coastal ecosystems is pollution of household waste, especially inorganic waste such as plastic bottles and cans which are very difficult to decompose. For example, it takes about 450 years to break one plastic bottle. Chemicals that each component contained could cause a severe effect on the environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-sea-pollution>What are the effects of sea pollution?</h2>
<p>Decline in Oysters. For some people in the world, eating oysters from the sea is a delicacy. The market for harvesting and providing oysters to the public is high.</p>
