<h2 id=why-is-a-new-moon-not-an-eclipse>Why is a new moon not an eclipse?</h2>
<p>Exploratorium Senior Scientist Paul Doherty explains why not—the orbit of the moon is tilted relative to the orbit of the Earth around the sun, so the moon often passes below or above Earth. At those times, it does not cross the line between the sun and the Earth, and therefore does not create a solar eclipse.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-lunar-eclipse-only-occur-during-a-new-moon-phase>Does a lunar eclipse only occur during a new moon phase?</h2>
<p>1. Why does a lunar eclipse only happen during full moon? Only during full moon and new moon is the Moon in a line with the Earth and Sun.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-an-eclipse-not-occur-in-every-new-moon-and-full-moon>Why does an eclipse not occur in every new moon and full moon?</h2>
<p>A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon comes in between the Sun and the Earth. It occurs on the new moon. They do not happen every on every full moon day or on every new moon day because the earth’s orbit around the sun is not in the same plane as the Moon’s orbit around the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=can-the-entire-earth-see-each-solar-eclipse>Can the entire Earth see each solar eclipse?</h2>
<p>But not everyone experiences every solar eclipse. Getting a chance to see a total solar eclipse is rare. The Moon’s shadow on Earth isn’t very big, so only a small portion of places on Earth will see it. On average, the same spot on Earth only gets to see a solar eclipse for a few minutes about every 375 years!</p>
<h2 id=is-solar-eclipse-the-same-as-new-moon>Is solar eclipse the same as new moon?</h2>
<p>A solar eclipse happens at new moon, when the moon passes between the sun and Earth. A lunar eclipse happens at the opposite moon phase – at full moon – when the Earth, sun and moon align in space, with Earth between the sun and moon. The moon takes about a month to orbit around the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=which-type-of-eclipse-lasts-longer>Which type of eclipse lasts longer?</h2>
<p>From a given point on Earth, a lunar eclipse will always take longer than a solar eclipse, for the reasons that Mansour Riaz gave. A solar eclipse rarely lasts more than 3 minutes (although the max is around 7.5 to 8 minutes), whereas lunar eclipses often last more than 4 hours, with totality lasting nearly 2 hours.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-the-whole-moon-be-dark>How can the whole moon be dark?</h2>
<p>The ‘dark side’ of the Moon refers to the hemisphere of the Moon that is facing away from the Earth. In reality it is no darker than any other part of the Moon’s surface as sunlight does in fact fall equally on all sides of the Moon.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-rarer-a-lunar-or-solar-eclipse>Which is rarer a lunar or solar eclipse?</h2>
<p>Solar eclipses are not actually rarer than lunar eclipses – in fact, they occur in about equal numbers, usually about two of each per year. However, at any one location on Earth, it is much less common to see a solar eclipse than a lunar one.</p>
<h2 id=what-lasts-longer-a-solar-or-lunar-eclipse>What lasts longer a solar or lunar eclipse?</h2>
<p>A total lunar eclipse can last as long as an hour and three-quarters, but for a solar total eclipse maximum duration of totality is only 71/2 minutes.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-solar-eclipse-occur-during-a-new-moon>Can a solar eclipse occur during a new moon?</h2>
<p>It can only occur during New Moon – Dark Moon A solar eclipse is when Sun – Moon – Earth — IN THAT ORDER are in (almost) perfect alignment. This happens only when the sun (as seen from the earth) is at the other side of the moon, so the sun is lighting the back side and not the side that is turned toward us (i.e. New Moon).</p>
<h2 id=when-does-a-total-lunar-eclipse-take-place>When does a total lunar eclipse take place?</h2>
<p>A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon and Sun are on opposite sides of Earth. A partial lunar eclipse happens when only part of Earth’s shadow covers the Moon.</p>

<h2 id=how-are-lunar-eclipses-and-solar-eclipses-alike>How are lunar eclipses and solar eclipses alike?</h2>
<p>A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes through the Earth’s shadow, just as a solar eclipse occurs when part of the Earth passes through the Moon’s shadow. So why don’t eclipses happen twice a month?</p>
