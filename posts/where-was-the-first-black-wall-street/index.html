<p>Tulsa<br>
Greenwood District<br>
Tulsa race massacre/Location</p>
<h2 id=was-the-greenwood-district-rebuilt>Was the Greenwood district rebuilt?</h2>
<p>In the spring of 1921 underlying social and economic tension in Tulsa sparked the worst racial violence in American history. Tulsa’s African Americans ultimately turned tragedy into triumph. They rebuilt the ravaged Greenwood District, which by 1942 boasted 242 black-owned and black-operated business establishments.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-jb-stradford>Who was JB Stradford?</h2>
<p>He was a Black businessman and community activist. John the Baptist (J.B.) Stradford was from in Versailles, KY, the son of Julius Caesar (J.C.). His father was enslaved, and his owner never gave him a last name, though his owner’s daughter befriended him and taught him to read.</p>
<h2 id=what-family-owned-several-grocery-stores-in-the-greenwood-district>What family owned several grocery stores in the Greenwood district?</h2>
<p>The history of Tulsa and its once-thriving, now-reviving historic Greenwood District is ever-present in the store. On one wall is a large mural of the Mann Brothers, who in 1921 owned their own grocery store.</p>
<h2 id=is-sarah-page-still-alive>Is Sarah Page still alive?</h2>
<p>Deceased (1863–1950)<br>
Sarah Page/Living or Deceased</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-greenwood-district-in-tulsa-known-for>What was the Greenwood District in Tulsa known for?</h2>
<p>Black Wall Street The Greenwood district in Tulsa came to be known as “Black Wall Street”, one of the most commercially successful and affluent majority African-American communities in the United States. Booker T. Washington referred to the Greenwood neighborhood as “Negro Wall Street.”</p>
<h2 id=where-was-greenwood-ok-before-wakanda-located>Where was Greenwood, OK before Wakanda, located?</h2>
<p>“Don’t you realize that Greenwood was Wakanda before Wakanda?” It’s a sweltering May evening in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma, and a local poet named Phetote Mshairi is performing for a crowd of about three dozen onlookers.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-greenwood-district-of-oklahoma-decline>Why did the Greenwood district of Oklahoma decline?</h2>
<p>Integration, urban renewal, a new business climate, and the aging of the early Greenwood District pioneers caused the community to decline through the years, beginning in the 1960s and continuing throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Few businesses remained at the end of the twentieth century.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-greenwood-cultural-center-in-oklahoma>What is the Greenwood Cultural Center in Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>The Greenwood Cultural Center, a multipurpose educational, arts, and humanities complex promoting history, culture, and positive race relations, anchors the modern-day Greenwood District.</p>
