<p>What are the different types of interest groups at work in American society? Business groups, labor groups, agricultural groups, issue-oriented groups, and public interest groups.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-pluralist-argument-for-interest-groups>What is the pluralist argument for interest groups?</h2>
<p>Classical pluralism is the view that politics and decision making are located mostly in the framework of government, but that many non-governmental groups use their resources to exert influence.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-definition-of-an-interest-group>What is the definition of an interest group?</h2>
<p>An interest group is a group of people working together through an organization and advocating on behalf of shared interests. Interest groups abound in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-interest-groups-are-there-in-the-united-states>How many interest groups are there in the United States?</h2>
<p>Largely for this reason, there is no comprehensive list of all interest groups to tell us how many there are in the United States. Estimates of the number vary widely, suggesting that if we use a broad definition and include all interests at all levels of government, there may be more than 200,000.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-interest-groups-able-to-raise-money>How are interest groups able to raise money?</h2>
<p>They are able to fund their organization by actively recruiting new members and charging dues. Interest groups also work within communities to help get individuals elected. They raise money for campaigns they support. At election time, they have been known to canvas neighborhoods and provide transportation to get people to the polls.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-interest-groups-in-health-care>Who are the interest groups in health care?</h2>
<p>Given its potential impact, interest group representatives ( lobbyists) from the insurance industry, hospitals, medical device manufacturers, and organizations representing doctors, patients, and employers all tried to influence what the law would look like and the way it would operate.</p>
