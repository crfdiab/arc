<h2 id=what-can-floods-cause-to-form>What can floods cause to form?</h2>
<p>How floods form. Excessive rain, a ruptured dam or levee, rapid melting of snow or ice, or even an unfortunately placed beaver dam can overwhelm a river, spreading over the adjacent land, called a floodplain. Coastal flooding occurs when a large storm or tsunami causes the sea to surge inland.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-factors-that-created-floods>What are the 3 factors that created floods?</h2>
<p>Physical causes of flooding:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>heavy rainfall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>long periods of rain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>snowmelt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>steep slopes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>impermeable rock (doesn’t allow water through)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>very wet, saturated soils.</p>
</li>

<h2 id=compacted-or-dry-soil-how-much-damage-is-caused-by-floods>compacted or dry soil. How much damage is caused by floods?</h2>
<p>Economic damage caused by floods in the U.S. 1995-2019 In 2019, floods caused approximately 3.75 billion U.S. dollars worth of property and crop damage across the United States.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-humans-cause-flooding-in-the-world>How do humans cause flooding in the world?</h2>
<p>Humans cause and exacerbate flooding due to urban development, destruction of natural wetlands and deforestation. Urban development causes water runoff into streams during heavy rain, and this runoff causes higher flood peaks and more frequent floods.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-water-from-a-flood-come-from>Where does the water from a flood come from?</h2>
<p>Flooding can come from all sorts of water sources, including groundwater, reservoirs and surface water. But cities and towns that lie on rivers or near the sea are most at risk. Generally speaking, increased rainfall causes flooding inland, while high tides and storms are behind much coastal flooding – and both can happen together.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-important-factor-in-creating-a-flood>Which is the most important factor in creating a flood?</h2>
<p>Rainfall is the most important factor in creating a flood Put simply, floods occur when the amount of water flowing from a catchmentexceeds the capacity of its drains, creeks and rivers. This process begins with rainfall, but is affected by many other factors.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-mankind-described-before-and-after-the-flood>How is mankind described before and after the flood?</h2>
<p>Before the flood, mankind is described as being “only evil continually” (Genesis 6:5). After the flood, mankind is described in similar fashion: “the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth” (Genesis 8:21). God didn’t send the flood to destroy an evil and rebellious humanity.</p>
