<h2 id=is-there-a-pole-on-the-moon>Is there a pole on the moon?</h2>
<p>The poles of the Moon are unique environments and preserve a surprising record of water and other volatile substances on the lunar surface. Because of the craters and mountains of the Moon, some areas near the pole are in near-permanent sunlight while others are permanently dark.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-moons-south-pole-cold>Is the moon’s south pole cold?</h2>
<p>During the lunar day, temperatures reach 120-degrees C (or 253 Fahrenheit), and then during the lunar night, temperatures drop down to -232 C (or -387 Fahrenheit). In other words, during the daytime, it’s definitely hot enough to sublimate away that ice. But at the Moon’s south pole, sunlight strikes at a low angle.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-landed-on-moon-south-pole>Which country landed on Moon South Pole?</h2>
<p>India<br>
India is preparing to become the first country to land a mission on the south pole of the Moon. Chandrayaan-2 entered the Moon’s orbit on 20 August, a month after take-off.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-north-pole-closer-to-the-moon>Is the North Pole closer to the moon?</h2>
<p>That’s because at the latitude of the photographer the path of the Moon and Sun in the sky intersects the horizon at a relatively shallow angle. At the north pole, this is far closer to what you’d see as the moon sets.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-everyone-heading-to-the-south-pole-of-the-moon>Why is everyone heading to the south pole of the moon?</h2>
<p>Role in the future exploration and observations The lunar south pole region is deemed as a compelling spot for future exploration missions and suitable for a lunar outpost. The permanently shadowed places on the Moon could contain ice and other minerals, which would be vital resources for future explorers.</p>
<h2 id=does-chandrayaan-2-failed>Does Chandrayaan 2 failed?</h2>
<p>India’s ambitious mission to land on the Moon failed. The Vikram lander, of the Chandrayaan 2 mission, crashed on the lunar surface on September 7, 2019, but it was only in December that scientists found it. That means the lander wouldn’t land at the intended location.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-a-full-moon-at-the-north-pole>Can you see a full moon at the North Pole?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can see the moon from the poles, but the times when the moon is visible at the poles are different from the times when the moon is visible at latitudes between -77 and +77 degrees, 23 degrees being approximately the earth’s axial tilt relative to the plane of the ecliptic.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-south-pole-of-the-moon-a-landing-site>Is the South Pole of the Moon a landing site?</h2>
<p>The South Pole is also a good target for a future human landing because robotically, it’s the most thoroughly investigated region on the Moon. The elliptical, polar orbit of NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO) is closest to the Moon during its pass over the South Pole region.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-ice-on-the-south-pole-of-the-moon>Is there ice on the South Pole of the Moon?</h2>
<p>In 1998 NASA’s Lunar Prospector mission used the presence of hydrogen as a sign of potential ice deposits. As you can see in this video, Prospector data showed significantly more hydrogen at the south pole of the moon (areas colored blue).</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-craters-near-the-south-pole-of-the-moon>Are there any craters near the South Pole of the Moon?</h2>
<p>Craters near the south pole have also been previously discussed for a possible Moon base. Those are not highlighted by any constantly illuminated spots, the same research group concluded previously. Even so, the north polar region needs further analysis before NASA can decide where to go first.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-sun-strike-the-south-pole-of-the-moon>How does the sun strike the South Pole of the Moon?</h2>
<p>In other words, during the daytime, it’s definitely hot enough to sublimate away that ice. But at the Moon’s south pole, sunlight strikes at a low angle. If you were standing on the Moon’s south pole, you’d see the Sun down on the horizon, casting long shadows across the lunar surface.</p>
