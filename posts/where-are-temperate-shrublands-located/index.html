<h2 id=where-are-temperate-shrublands-located>Where are temperate shrublands located?</h2>
<p>Shrublands are the areas that are located in west coastal regions between 30° and 40° North and South latitude. Some of the places would include southern California, Chile, Mexico, areas surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, and southwest parts of Africa and Australia.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-temperate-woodland-and-shrubland>What is temperate woodland and shrubland?</h2>
<p>The open woodlands and shrublands contain many wildflowers which lie between oak and other large trees. Areas that are more dominated by shrubs are known as Chaparral. Winters are very mild, whereas summers are very hot and dry this gives rise to multiple fires.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-climate-of-temperate-woodlands>What is the climate of temperate woodlands?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-the-weather-like-in-a-shrubland>What is the weather like in a shrubland?</h2>
<p>Shrubland 1 Temperature. The summers are hot and dry with temperatures reaching up to 38°C (100°F). 2 Precipitation.

<h2 id=what-kind-of-trees-are-in-a-shrubland>What kind of trees are in a shrubland?</h2>
<p>The shrublands are made up of shrubs or short trees. Many shrubs thrive on steep, rocky slopes. There is usually not enough rain to support tall trees.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-tall-trees-adapted-to-live-in-shrubland>How are tall trees adapted to live in shrubland?</h2>
<p>There is usually not enough rain to support tall trees. Shrublands are usually fairly open so grasses and other short plants grow between the shrubs. In the areas with little rainfall, plants have adapted to drought-like conditions. Many plants have small, needle-like leaves that help to conserve water.</p>
