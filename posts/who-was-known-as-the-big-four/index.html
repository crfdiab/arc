<h2 id=who-were-the-big-four-and-what-were-their-goals>Who were the big four and what were their goals?</h2>
<p>The Big Four of the Paris Peace Conference were Woodrow Wilson of the United States, David Lloyd George of Britain, Georges Clemenceau of France, and Vittorio Orlando of Italy. These four met in early 1919 in order to create a lasting peace and to appease their respective constituents back home.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-germany-signed-in-1919>What did Germany signed in 1919?</h2>
<p>On June 28, 1919, the Treaty of Versailles was signed at the Palace of Versailles outside Paris, France. The treaty was one of several that officially ended five years of conflict known as the Great War—World War I.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-big-four-quizlet>Who were the big four quizlet?</h2>
<p>The Big Four were the four most important leaders, and the most important ones at the Paris Peace Conference. They were Woodrow Wilson- USA, David Lloyd George- UK, George Clemenceau- France, and Vittorio Orlando- Italy.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-big-four-in-history>What is the big four in history?</h2>
<p>Though nearly thirty nations participated, the representatives of Great Britain, France, the United States, and Italy became known as the “Big Four.” The “Big Four” would dominate the proceedings that led to the formulation of the Treaty of Versailles, a treaty that articulated the compromises reached at the conference …</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-big-four-in-world-war-1>Who are the Big Four in World War 1?</h2>
<p>The term “Big Four” is most commonly used in history to refer to the leaders of the allied countries who had the most input at the peace conference following World War I. These men had the most influence over the eventual shape of the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-leaders-of-the-big-four>Who are the leaders of the Big Four?</h2>
<p><a href=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/leaders-of-th>https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/leaders-of-th</a>… The term “Big Four” is most commonly used in history to refer to the leaders of the allied countries who had the most input at the peace conference following World War I. These men had the most influence over the eventual shape of the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-us-important-to-the-big-four>Why was the US important to the Big Four?</h2>
<p>The British and the French had borne the brunt of the fighting during the war. The US was an important country because its entry into the war in 1917 changed the balance of powers and allowed the Allied Powers to win the war. The fourth member of the Big Four was less important. This was the leader of Italy Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-orlando-known-as-the-big-four>Why was Orlando known as the Big Four?</h2>
<p>Italy had not played a very important part in the war. This made it much harder for Orlando to get the provisions he wanted included in the treaty. It was difficult enough that he left the peace conference in protest for a period of time. These men are commonly known as the Big Four.</p>
