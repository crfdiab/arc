<h2 id=how-many-states-have-a-legal-drinking-age-of-21>How many states have a legal drinking age of 21?</h2>
<p>By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below). South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-drink-at-all-under-the-age-of-21>Can you drink at all under the age of 21?</h2>
<p>Along with Oregon, California has the nation’s oldest MLDA 21 laws. In 2016, there was an initiative to lower the drinking age to 18, but it did not gain much support. However, underage drinking is allowed in the presence of a responsible adult.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-states-have-a-21-and-over-drinking-age>Why do states have a 21 and over drinking age?</h2>
<p>The drinking age was raised back to 21 over federal highway funding. In 1984, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act passed, which stated federal highway funds would be withheld from U.S. states that failed to set the minimum legal drinking age back at 21. By 1988, all the states had adopted the age minimum.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-legal-drinking-age-in-every-state>What is the legal drinking age in every state?</h2>
<p>The alcohol and liquor laws of each state in the U.S. set the minimum drinking age as 21 years of age. A person under the age of 21 who is caught drinking can usually be subjected to legal consequences.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-for-a-21-year-old-to-drink-alcohol>Is it legal for a 21 year old to drink alcohol?</h2>
<p>However, underage drinking is allowed in the presence of a responsible adult. It was done to help parents teach their children the importance of moderation when drinking. This state is strict and enforces the law against possession or consumption of alcohol by anyone under 21.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-minimum-drinking-age-raised-to-21>When was the minimum drinking age raised to 21?</h2>
<p>The enactment of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 (56 KB) prompted states to raise their legal age for purchase or public possession of alcohol to 21 or risk losing millions in federal highway funds. By 1988, all 50 states had raised their MLDA to 21.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-buy-alcohol-in-the-usa>How old do you have to be to buy alcohol in the USA?</h2>
<p>Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) laws specify the legal age when an individual can purchase or publicly consume alcoholic beverages. The MLDA in the United States is 21 years. However, prior to the enactment of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, the legal age when alcohol could be purchased varied from state to state.1.</p>
