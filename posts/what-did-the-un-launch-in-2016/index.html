<h2 id=what-did-the-un-launch-in-2016>What did the UN launch in 2016?</h2>
<p>News on Millennium Development Goals As the MDGs era comes to a conclusion with the end of the year, 2016 ushers in the official launch of the bold and transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by world leaders last September at the United Nations.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-we-move-from-mdg-to-sdg>Why did we move from MDG to SDG?</h2>
<p>The objective was to produce a set of universal goals that meet the urgent environmental, political and economic challenges facing our world. The SDGs replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which started a global effort in 2000 to tackle the indignity of poverty.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-un-sdg-are-there>How many UN SDG are there?</h2>
<p>17 Sustainable Development Goals<br>
In September 2015, the General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-mdg-and-sdg>What’s the difference between MDG and SDG?</h2>
<p>Unlike the MDGs, which only targets the developing countries, the SDGs apply to all countries whether rich, middle or poor countries. The SDGs are also nationally-owned and country-led, wherein each country is given the freedom to establish a national framework in achieving the SDGs.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-philippines-doing-in-the-un>How is the Philippines doing in the UN?</h2>
<p>The Philippines in the United Nations: On a Steady Path to Peace and Sustainable Development On behalf of the Philippine Government, I express our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-philippines-sign-the-united-nations-declaration>When did the Philippines sign the United Nations Declaration?</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, the U.N. also urged the Philippines not to reinstate the death penalty as it is in violation of the country’s commitment under international law. The Philippines signed the Declaration by United Nations on June 10, 1942.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-theme-of-the-70th-un-general-assembly>What was the theme of the 70th UN General Assembly?</h2>
<p>Theme: “The United Nations at 70: The Philippines in the United Nations: On a Steady Path to Peace and Sustainable Development On behalf of the Philippine Government, I express our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-philippine-ambassador-to-the-united-nations>Who was the Philippine Ambassador to the United Nations?</h2>
<p>The relationship between the Philippine government and UN is underscored by the contributions made by Carlos P. Romulo who acted as Philippine delegate to the United Nations Organization Conference and then became the Philippine ambassador to the United Nations from 1946 to 1954.</p>
