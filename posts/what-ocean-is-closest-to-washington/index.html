<h2 id=what-ocean-is-closest-to-washington>What ocean is closest to Washington?</h2>
<p>Pacific Ocean<br>
The rugged beauty of Oregon and Washington’s mountains, seacoast and forests attract millions of tourists every year. The coastal range borders the Pacific Ocean from Washington’s Olympic Peninsula on the north to the Klamath mountains of Oregon on the south. The rolling coastal ranges run parallel to the coastline.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-ocean-like-in-washington-state>What is the ocean like in Washington state?</h2>
<p>Located in the Pacific Northwest, Washington state offers an oceanic coast as well as many inland rivers and lakes. The ocean water along the Pacific coast here flows down from the Arctic and is generally too cold for swimming.</p>
<h2 id=what-ocean-is-closest-to-seattle>What ocean is closest to Seattle?</h2>
<p>northern Pacific Ocean<br>
A major port of entry and an air and sea gateway to Asia and Alaska, Seattle lies alongside Puget Sound, a deep inland arm of the northern Pacific Ocean, and is at the centre of a conurbation that is defined roughly by Everett to the north, Bellevue to the east, and Tacoma to the south.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-ocean-in-seattle>Is there a ocean in Seattle?</h2>
<p>Ocean Shores Ocean Shores is one of the most popular beach towns west of Seattle along the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-sharks-in-seattle>Are there sharks in Seattle?</h2>
<p>There are arguably between seven to 10 species of sharks in the broader Puget Sound area. The most common type found is a small and skittish shark called the dogfish sharks. One of the largest types is known as the sixgill shark. The risk for shark attacks in Puget Sound is exceedingly low.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-time-of-year-to-visit-seattle>What is the best time of year to visit Seattle?</h2>
<p>The best time to visit Seattle is from September to October. Summer marks the city’s high season, meaning room rates rise and availability drops, while cold winter weather can deter even the most avid sightseers.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-ocean-beaches-in-washington-state>Are there any ocean beaches in Washington State?</h2>
<p>Ocean beaches along the Pacific Ocean range from wild and without civilization anywhere near them, to mildly developed. Don’t expect anything along the lines of larger California beaches, or even Oregon’s bigger beaches . Meanwhile, beaches on islands along the Puget Sound and even on lakes provide some diversity to the state’s beach scene.</p>
<h2 id=where-to-stay-on-the-washington-state-coast>Where to stay on the Washington State coast?</h2>
<p>Here are some suggestions to get you started: 1 Washington Coast Campgrounds If you want the full-immersion experience, try camping on the Washington coast. 2 Washington State Airbnbs There are many amazing places to stay on the Washington Coast on a budget! 3 Washington Coast Resorts and Lodges</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-best-coastal-towns-in-washington-state>Where are the best coastal towns in Washington State?</h2>
<p>The Puget Sound is home to a number of popular and easily accessible islands in Washington: namely Orcas Island, Lopez Island, and San Juan Island with its lovely coastal town of Friday Harbor. Each offers its own unique take on coastal living in Washington State.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-see-all-the-ports-in-washington-state>How to see all the ports in Washington State?</h2>
