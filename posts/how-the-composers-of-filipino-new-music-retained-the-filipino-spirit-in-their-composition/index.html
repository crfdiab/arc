<h2 id=how-the-composers-of-filipino-new-music-retained-the-filipino-spirit-in-their-composition>How the composers of Filipino new music retained the Filipino spirit in their composition?</h2>
<p>Composers of experimental New Music in the Philippines include Jose Maceda, Lucrecia Kasilag, Ramon Santos, and Francisco Feliciano. They retained the Filipino spirit by incorporating traditional music forms as well as indigenous rhythms and instruments in their compositions.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-three-main-influences-of-philippine-music>Who are the three main influences of Philippine music?</h2>
<p>These three main streams of Philippine music– indigenous, Spanish influenced religious and secular music, American/European influenced classical, semi-classical, and popular music comprise what we refer to today as Philippine music.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-music-of-the-philippines-change>When did the music of the Philippines change?</h2>
<p>With the coming of the Spaniards the Filipino’s music underwent a transformation with the influx of western influences, particularly the Spanish-European culture prevalent during the 17th to the 19th centuries. The Hispanization during the succeeding three centuries after 1521 was tied up with religious conversion.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-music-did-the-filipinos-listen-to>What kind of music did the Filipinos listen to?</h2>
<p>It is this type of music that is still practiced today by the indigenous groups. With the coming of the Spaniards the Filipino’s music underwent a transformation with the influx of western influences, particularly the Spanish-European culture prevalent during the 17th to the 19th centuries.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-filipinos-write-in-roman-characters>Why do Filipinos write in Roman characters?</h2>
<p>Lots of foreigners are happy that the Filipinos write in roman characters. This fact is the result of the Spanish colonialization. Before the Spaniards invaded the Philippines, people had their own writing. Read also “Literature”. More and more young Filipinos have a look back on their roots.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-mean-by-culture-in-the-philippines>What do you mean by culture in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>In its broadest sense, culture can now be regarded as the set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of a society or a social group. It includes not only the arts and literature, lifestyles and fundamental rights of human being, but also value systems, traditions and beliefs.</p>
