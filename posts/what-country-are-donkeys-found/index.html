<h2 id=are-there-donkeys-in-america>Are there donkeys in America?</h2>
<p>In the United States, wild donkeys are often called burros, the Spanish word for donkeys. Almost 12,000 wild burros roam ranges in the United States, and about another 1,000 are kept in corrals, according to the Bureau of Land Management, which is responsible for them. In America, the term “ass” elicits giggles.</p>

<h2 id=is-jackass-a-swear-word>Is jackass a swear word?</h2>
<p>A jerk can be the same, but it usually means something like being mean or purposely treating somebody badly. Also, jackass is a swear word (at least where I’m from) and, while it isn’t nice unless called for, jerk is not. They’re both insults, jackass being slightly more insulting because it has the word “ass” in it.</p>
