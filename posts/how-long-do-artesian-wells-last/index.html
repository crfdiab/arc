<h2 id=how-long-do-artesian-wells-last>How long do artesian wells last?</h2>
<p>The average pump and pressure tank last 10-15 years, but it is not uncommon to hear of 20-year-old pumps. Having the proper components will increase the longevity of your system immensely.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-an-artesian-well-differ-from-a-regular-well>How does an artesian well differ from a regular well?</h2>
<p>Artesian wells are formed from artesian aquifer. Artesian aquifers are confined aquifers that hold groundwater underground using pressure. However, unlike wells that are dug by hand or drilled deep into the ground, artesian wells may require less digging because of how close the groundwater is to the surface.</p>
<h2 id=can-artesian-wells-dry-up>Can artesian wells dry up?</h2>
<p>Depending on where your well is located and the height of the piezometric water level will determine if your artesian well flows or not. All it takes is a reduction in the piezometric water level (hydraulic head) for your well to stop flowing and can even run dry.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-get-water-from-an-artesian-well>How do you get water from an artesian well?</h2>
<p>If a well is drilled from the land surface through the overlying impervious layer, the pressure inside the aquifer will cause the water to rise in the well . In areas where the pressure of the aquifer is great enough, the water rises above ground level resulting in a flowing artesian well .</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-dig-an-artesian-well>How much does it cost to dig an artesian well?</h2>
<p>An artesian well costs $35 to $85 per foot or $5,000 to $15,000 for drilling and casing to an average depth of 150 to 450 feet to hit an aquifer. Groundwater in aquifers between layers of rock is a pressurized body of water, causing water to flow naturally without pumping or electricity when tapped by a well.</p>
<h2 id=do-artesian-wells-need-a-pump>Do artesian wells need a pump?</h2>
<p>An artesian well is a water well that doesn’t require a pump to bring water to the surface; this occurs when there is enough pressure in the aquifer.</p>
<h2 id=is-artesian-water-healthy-to-drink>Is artesian water healthy to drink?</h2>
<p>Artesian water is the best for your body! The natural occurring minerals in artesian water can include potassium and magnesium, which are important for adrenal function.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-ok-to-drink-artesian-water>Is it OK to drink artesian water?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this means that artesian water is subject to any of the standard contaminants that can be found in any untreated water source – pesticides, bacteria, viruses, lead, chromium 6, arsenic, and more.” Florida and Georgia are great examples of how artesian well water might not be safe to drink.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-an-artesian-well-come-to-the-surface>How does an artesian well come to the surface?</h2>
<p>An artesian well is simply a well that doesn’t require a pump to bring water to the surface; this occurs when there is enough pressure in the aquifer. The pressure forces the water to the surface without any sort of assistance. Furthermore, are artesian wells good?</p>
<h2 id=when-does-an-artesian-well-need-a-pump>When does an artesian well need a pump?</h2>
<p>An artesian well is simply a well that doesn’t require a pump to bring water to the surface. This occurs when there is enough positive pressure in the aquifer to bring the water to the surface.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-drink-water-from-an-artesian-well>Is it safe to drink water from an artesian well?</h2>
<p>An artesian aquifer is a confined aquifer containing groundwater under positive pressure. If water reaches the ground surface under the natural pressure of the aquifer, the well is termed a flowing artesian well. Keeping this in view, is it safe to drink water from an artesian well?</p>
<h2 id=how-does-an-artesian-well-work-for-drilcorp>How does an artesian well work for drilcorp?</h2>
<p>An artesian well is a smart and sustainable water source. Creating artesian wells is one of the many services we offer here at Drilcorp. Our experts can assess your site and take the appropriate steps to provide you with access to an incredible water provided by nature.</p>
