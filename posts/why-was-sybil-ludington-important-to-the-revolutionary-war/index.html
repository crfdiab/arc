<h2 id=why-was-sybil-ludington-important-to-the-revolutionary-war>Why was Sybil Ludington important to the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>Sybil Ludington, married name Sybil Ogden, (born April 5, 1761, Fredericksburg [now Ludingtonville], New York [U.S.]—died February 26, 1839, Unadilla, New York, U.S.), American Revolutionary War heroine, remembered for her valiant role in defense against British attack.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-sybil-ludingtons-early-life-like>What was Sybil Ludington’s early life like?</h2>
<p>Early Life As a farmer and mill owner in Patterson, New York, Ludington was a community leader and volunteered to serve as the local militia commander as war with the British loomed. His wife Abigail (1745–1825) was a cousin; they married on May 1, 1760.</p>
<h2 id=did-sybil-ludington-really-ride>Did Sybil Ludington really ride?</h2>
<p>Paul Revere, for instance, wasn’t the only one on the midnight ride. And Sybil Ludington—the young woman who has gone down in history as a female version of Paul Revere, riding through the surrounding area of what would become New York—may never have ridden at all, at least according to one historian.</p>

<p>Ludington was said to have warned people asleep in their homes by banging on their shutters with a stick and yelling “The British are burning Danbury!” Sybil’s father had fought in the French and Indian War, and he volunteered to head the local militia during the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>Sybil Ludington<br>
Nicknamed the “Female Paul Revere,” Sybil Ludington was only sixteen years of age when she embarked on horse through the night in order to warn Patriot militia of the approaching British Army. Sybil was born in 1761 in Fredericksburg, (now called Ludingtonville) New York.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-sybil-ludington-after-the-war>What happened to Sybil Ludington after the war?</h2>
<p>After the war, Ludington married in 1784, at age 23, when she met Edward Ogden. The couple had one son, Henry, and lived in Catskill, New York. At age seventy-seven, Ludington died in poverty. Ludington was honored with a stamp by the Postal Service in 1975.</p>
