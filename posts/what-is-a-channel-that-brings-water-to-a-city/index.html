<h2 id=what-is-a-channel-that-brings-water-to-a-city>What is a channel that brings water to a city?</h2>
<p>Explanation: An aqueduct is a pathway that carries water from a source to a distribution or drop off point.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-definition-of-aqueducts>What’s the definition of aqueducts?</h2>
<p>aqueduct, (from Latin aqua + ducere, “to lead water”), conduit built to convey water. In a restricted sense, aqueducts are structures used to conduct a water stream across a hollow or valley.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-use-of-aqueducts>What is the use of aqueducts?</h2>
<p>Gravity and the natural slope of the land allowed aqueducts to channel water from a freshwater source, such as a lake or spring, to a city. As water flowed into the cities, it was used for drinking, irrigation, and to supply hundreds of public fountains and baths.</p>
<h2 id=do-we-still-use-aqueducts>Do we still use aqueducts?</h2>
<p>Aqueducts were popular in ancient Rome The aqueduct was used to supply water to the town on Nimes, which is about 30 miles from the Mediterranean Sea. There is even a Roman aqueduct that is still functioning and bringing water to some of Rome’s fountains.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-channel-that-brings-water-to-a-city-from-nearby-hills>What is the channel that brings water to a city from nearby hills?</h2>
<p>An aqueduct is a watercourse constructed to carry water from a source to a distribution point far away.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-aqueducts-transport-water>How do aqueducts transport water?</h2>
<p>The Romans constructed aqueducts throughout their Republic and later Empire, to bring water from outside sources into cities and towns. Aqueducts moved water through gravity alone, along a slight overall downward gradient within conduits of stone, brick, or concrete; the steeper the gradient, the faster the flow.</p>
<h2 id=whats-an-example-of-aqueduct>What’s an example of aqueduct?</h2>
<p>An example of an aqueduct is the aqueduct of Sylvius which is a canal that connects the third and fourth ventricles of the brain and contains cerebrospinal fluid. The definition of an aqueduct is a man-made tube or channel used for transporting water a long distance. An example of an aqueduct is the Zanja Madre.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-root-word-for-aqueducts>What is the root word for Aqueducts?</h2>
<p>Aqueduct comes from the Latin word aquæductus, which itself is from the roots aqua, meaning water, and ducere, meaning “to lead.” Because of the root word aqua, there is a tendency to try to spell aqueduct with an A in place of the E, but now you’ll know better.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-aqueducts-work>How do aqueducts work?</h2>
<p>Aqueducts moved water through gravity alone, along a slight overall downward gradient within conduits of stone, brick, or concrete; the steeper the gradient, the faster the flow.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-aqueducts-still-used-today>Where are aqueducts still used today?</h2>
<p>Roman aqueducts are still in use in countries such as Italy, France, Portugal, Israel and Turkey. In ancient times, aqueducts were used to transport all water to the cities, but today many of them are only used for irrigation purposes.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-definition-of-a-water-channel>Which is the best definition of a water channel?</h2>
<p>1. the bed of a stream or other way through which liquid can flow. a sewage channel. 2. a passage of deeper water in a river, through which ships can sail. 3. a narrow stretch of water joining two seas. the English Channel. 4. a means of sending or receiving information etc. We got the information through the usual channels.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-channel-for-carrying-away-rainwater-mean>What does channel for carrying away rainwater mean?</h2>
<p>burn unsteadily, feebly, or low; flicker; “The cooling lava continued to gutter toward lower ground” a channel along the eaves or on the roof; collects and carries away rainwater a worker who guts things (fish or buildings or cars etc.)</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-gene-for-a-water-channel-located>Where is the gene for a water channel located?</h2>
<p>Moving slowly lets the rubber of the o-ring compress and slip past the edges of a water channel or other transitions instead of being cut by these edges in a single swift movement. The gene encodes a protein called a water channel, which normally resides within the outer membranes of cells.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-rawalpindi-people-use-the-water-channel-for>What does Rawalpindi people use the water channel for?</h2>
<p>Rawalpindi people use the water channel as garbage dump, which restricts flow of water causing urban flood. The entire passages of the two water channels would be combed, surveyed and examined carefully to see where contaminated water enters into the water channel and the reservoir.</p>
