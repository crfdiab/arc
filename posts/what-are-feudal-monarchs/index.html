<h2 id=what-are-feudal-monarchs>What are feudal monarchs?</h2>
<p>At the very top of feudal society were the monarchs, or kings and queens. As you have learned, medieval monarchs were also feudal lords. They were expected to keep order and to provide protection for their vassals. They had to rely on their vassals, especially nobles, to provide enough knights and soldiers.</p>
<h2 id=who-ruled-the-feudalism>Who ruled the feudalism?</h2>
<p>Feudalism in 12th-century England was among the better structured and established systems in Europe at the time. The king was the absolute “owner” of land in the feudal system, and all nobles, knights, and other tenants, termed vassals, merely “held” land from the king, who was thus at the top of the feudal pyramid.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-monarchy>What are the different types of monarchy?</h2>
<p>There are two types of monarchies: constitutional and absolute. Constitutional monarchies limit the monarch’s power as outlined in a constitution, while absolute monarchies give a monarch unlimited power.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-2-types-of-monarchies>What are the 2 types of monarchies?</h2>
<p>When it comes to succession of the crown, there are two basic types in a monarchy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hereditary monarchs – Title is handed down through bloodlines.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-at-the-top-of-feudal-society>Who was at the top of feudal society?</h2>
<p>At the very top of feudal society were the monarchs, or kings and queens. As you have learned, medieval monarchs were also feudal lords. They were expected to keep order and to provide protection for their vassals. Most medieval monarchs believed in the divine right of kings,</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-monarchs-do-to-their-vassals>What did the monarchs do to their vassals?</h2>
<p>Monarchs. They kept some of their land for themselves but gave fiefs or land grants to the most prominent lords, who became his vassals. Although, the vassals were required to supply the king with knights and soldiers in times of warfare. The monarchs were expected to keep order and to protect the vassals.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-monarchs-of-england-get-their-power>How did the monarchs of England get their power?</h2>
<p>Although, they usually got it differently. First, some had to work for their power. Only a small group had enough wealth to keep their armies. Some seized the throne. Monarchs also got their military power from vassals and nobles. Question: How was the monarchy in England?</p>
