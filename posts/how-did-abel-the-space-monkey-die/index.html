<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-monkey-that-went-to-the-moon>What was the name of the monkey that went to the moon?</h2>
<p>Long before Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin famously set foot on the moon, the hero of America’s human spaceflight program was a chimpanzee named Ham. On Jan. 31, 1961 — a few months before Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin’s pioneering flight — Ham became the first hominid in space.</p>
<h2 id=did-sam-the-monkey-survive>Did Sam the monkey survive?</h2>
<p>After attaining an altitude of 51 miles, the spacecraft landed safely in the Atlantic Ocean. Sam was recovered, several hours later, with no ill effects from his journey. He was later returned to the colony in which he trained, where he died in November 1982 and his remains were cremated.</p>

<h2 id=is-it-sad-that-a-monkey-died-in-space>Is it sad that a monkey died in space?</h2>
<p>Although I am sad that the animal died, our intentions were to see if we could get it alive. The death of this monkey has no impact on your life. It has no impact on ANYONE’s life. It’s death is a damn shame, but it’s better than sending a person.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-monkeys-name-that-went-to-space>What was the monkeys name that went to space?</h2>
<p>The first monkey sent to outer space was named Albert II. Albert II was a Rhesus Monkey, a small monkey that is known for its survivability of a large range of habitats. Albert II was sent into space by the United States space program in order for scientists to test the effects of radiation that astronauts would be exposed to at high altitudes.</p>
