<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-korean-war>What was the outcome of the Korean War?</h2>
<p>1945 – After World War II, Japanese occupation ends with Soviet troops occupying area north of the 38th parallel, and US troops in the south. 1948 – Republic of Korea proclaimed. 1950 – South declares independence, sparking North Korean invasion. 1953 – Armistice ends Korean War, which has cost two million lives.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-economy-of-south-korea>How big is the economy of South Korea?</h2>
<p>In each of the last five decades, the average annual rate of growth has exceeded 5% and the economy is now an innovation-driven, high-income country of just under 49 million people with a total GDP in excess of $1 trillion and a per capita income of over $20,000 (PPP adjusted).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-south-korea-grow-after-world-war-2>How did South Korea grow after World War 2?</h2>
<p>The growth of educational institutions and of commercial and industrial enterprises in and around South Korea’s major cities attracted an increasing number of rural people to urban areas. Seoul, in particular, grew some 10-fold to about 10 million people between the end of World War II and the early 21st century.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-economy-like-in-south-korea-in-1961>What was the economy like in South Korea in 1961?</h2>
<p>By contrast, South Korea during this time was characterized by political corruption and turmoil, sluggish economic growth, and dependency on massive aid from the United States. On the surface, at least, there seemed little to suggest that South Korea in 1961 was on the eve of one of the most dramatic economic transformations in history.</p>

<p>Despite the signed truce, the conflict was not settled and Korea remains divided in two nations. The war began when Communist-led North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950. With the help of the United Nations, South Korea was able to force the North Koreans back into their territory.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-died-in-the-korean-war>How many people died in the Korean War?</h2>
<p>The war cost the lives of millions of Koreans and Chinese, as well as over 50,000 Americans. It had been a frustrating war for Americans, who were used to forcing the unconditional surrender of their enemies. Many also could not understand why the United States had not expanded the war into China or used its nuclear arsenal.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-korean-war-and-why>Who was involved in the Korean War and why?</h2>
<p>The war pitted South Korea and the United States, fighting under the auspices of the United Nations, against North Korea and China.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-korea-divided-during-world-war-2>Why was Korea divided during World War 2?</h2>
<p>When Japan surrendered to the Allies following the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II, control of the Korean peninsula passed from Japan to the Americans and the Soviet Union. The superpowers chose to divide Korea between themselves at the 38 th parallel, which roughly bisected the peninsula.</p>
