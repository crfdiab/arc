<h2 id=what-is-the-most-dangerous-in-ireland>What is the most dangerous in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Tralee town square described as the ‘most dangerous’ in Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-bad-parts-of-ireland>Are there bad parts of Ireland?</h2>
<p>Limerick has the highest crime levels for sex offences and criminal damage to property, while Waterford has the worst crime rate for assaults, weapons and explosives offences. Cork is the city with the lowest crime rates, but the highest homicide rate.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-rent-so-high-in-ireland>Why is rent so high in Ireland?</h2>
<p>The multinationals are attracting large numbers of employees from overseas and in some cases they are subsiding the rents that employees are paying. There has been an influx of ‘Professional Landlords’ into the country and they are seeking high prices.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-problems-in-the-state-of-ireland>Are there any problems in the state of Ireland?</h2>
<p>There are many problems which are dominating the state of Ireland. They mainly include policy issues, political problems and the social problems dominating the Irish state currently. There are countless social problems occurring in the country of Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-troubles-in-northern-ireland>What was the cause of the Troubles in Northern Ireland?</h2>
<p>See Article History. Alternative Title: Northern Ireland conflict. The Troubles, also called Northern Ireland conflict, violent sectarian conflict from about 1968 to 1998 in Northern Ireland between the overwhelmingly Protestant unionists (loyalists), who desired the province to remain part of the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-housing-crisis-in-ireland-now>Is there a housing crisis in Ireland now?</h2>
<p>The housing crisis in Ireland is a hot topic. Whilst, post-recession, property building has finally resumed, there remains an insanely low number of affordable housing options. Dublin remains the worst offender for this – an issue only aggravated by the excessive cost of living, but the problem exists country-wide.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-living-in-ireland>What are the disadvantages of living in Ireland?</h2>
<p>New government incentives to close this gap are underway, but for now, the housing crisis is a leading disadvantage of living in Ireland. Although major cities are somewhat covered, infrastructure in the more remote parts of Ireland is a major concern.</p>
