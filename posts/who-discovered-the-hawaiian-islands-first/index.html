<p>Captain James Cook<br>
1,500 years ago: Polynesians arrive in Hawaii after navigating the ocean using only the stars to guide them. 1778: Captain James Cook lands at Waimea Bay on the island of Kauai, becoming the first European to make contact with the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<h2 id=who-named-the-hawaiian-islands>Who named the Hawaiian Islands?</h2>
<p>Captain James Cook visited the islands on January 18, 1778, and named them the “Sandwich Islands” in honor of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, who as the First Lord of the Admiralty was one of his sponsors. This name was in use until the 1840s, when the local name “Hawaii” gradually began to take precedence.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-hawaiian-islands-called-when-they-were-first-discovered>What were the Hawaiian Islands called when they were first discovered?</h2>
<p>the Sandwich Islands<br>
The first Europeans arrived much later in Hawaii, beginning with English explorer Captain James Cook in 1778, who named the islands he discovered the Sandwich Islands after the English Earl of Sandwich.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-japanese-discover-hawaii>Did the Japanese discover Hawaii?</h2>
<p>These were thought to have developed through cultural contact, most likely through voyages from Japan to Hawai’i in the period 1550–1630 AD. The shipping practices in shogunate Japan were highly regulated and show that there were up to a dozen successful voyages to Hawai’i from Japan between 1600 and 1778.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-discover-hawaii>Who was the first person to discover Hawaii?</h2>
<p>On January 18, 1778, the English explorer Captain James Cook becomes the first European to discover the Hawaiian Islands when he sails past the island of Oahu. Two days later, he landed at Waimea on the island of Kauai and named the island group the Sandwich Islands, in honor of John Montague, who was the earl of Sandwich and one his patrons.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-settlement-of-the-hawaiian-islands>When was the first settlement of the Hawaiian Islands?</h2>
<p>There is no definitive date for the Polynesian discovery of Hawaii. However, high-precision radiocarbon dating in Hawaii using chonometric hygiene analysis, and taxonomic identification selection of samples, puts the initial first settlement of the Hawaiian Islands sometime between 1219 and 1266 C.E.,…</p>
<h2 id=where-did-james-cook-find-the-hawaiian-islands>Where did James Cook find the Hawaiian Islands?</h2>
<p>Captain James Cook spotted the Hawaiian Islands and then made landfall at Waimea Bay, which is located on the island of Kauai. It is interesting that this is the most northern of all major Hawaiian Islands, because Cook came to Hawaii sailing almost directly from the north (he was previously in the Bering Strait between Asia and North America).</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-oldest-island-in-the-hawaiian-islands>Which is the oldest island in the Hawaiian Islands?</h2>
<p>The age of the archipelago has been estimated using potassium-argon dating methods. From this study and others, it is estimated that the northwesternmost island, Kure Atoll, is the oldest at approximately 28 million years (Ma); while the southeasternmost island, Hawaiʻi, is approximately 0.4 Ma</p>
