<h2 id=what-are-some-geographic-features-found-in-new-york-city>What are some geographic features found in New York City?</h2>
<p>The Hudson-Mohawk Lowland contains much of the Hudson and Mohawk River valleys, and the Allegheny Plateau, stretching from Lake Erie along the border with Pennsylvania, includes the 11 Finger Lakes and the forested Catskill Mountains. The Erie-Ontario Lowland is a plain dotted with oval-shaped mounds called drumlins.</p>
<h2 id=what-geographic-feature-caused-new-york-to-become-the-commercial-capital-of-the-united-states>What geographic feature caused New York to become the commercial capital of the United States?</h2>
<p>The Erie Canal transformed New York City into America’s commercial capital. Believing the Erie Canal to be a pork-barrel project that would only benefit upstate towns, many of New York City’s political leaders tried to block its construction.</p>
<h2 id=what-made-new-york-so-successful>What made New York so successful?</h2>
<p>New York’s geographical advantage was supplemented by the construction of the Erie Canal (1817–1825), and with the establishment of Black Ball Lines in 1818. Both the Canal and the Line helped to solidify New York’s place as America’s center of commercial trade and central transportation hub.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-geographical-features-of-new-york-city>What are the geographical features of New York City?</h2>
<p>New York is one of the cities and has demolished all the land to make space for housing and services, this has now completely deforested all the land on the Manhattan island. Research has found old maps showing the basic topography of the land of the first settlement of New York.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-world-trade-center-important-to-new-york>Why was the World Trade Center important to New York?</h2>
<p>The Port Authority pleaded to the court that the World Trade Center would be a public benefit because it would be the world’s biggest real estate development and was necessary for export and import trade as well as a platform for a large migration of immigrants to fuel the economy.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-lower-manhattan-important-to-new-york-city>Why was lower Manhattan important to New York City?</h2>
<p>Lower Manhattan was in jeopardy of losing its status as the financial center of New York City. Major companies took their business uptown and created large office buildings far from the financial district. As the governor of New York, it was Nelson Rockefeller’s job to save the birthplace of economics and world trade in our country.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-explain-trade-in-new-york-city>How to explain trade in New York City?</h2>
<p>Give each student a copy of Trade in New Amsterdam. Explain to students that the reading passage explains why sailors traveled between the Netherlands in Europe and New Amsterdam (early New York City) to trade with Native Americans. Have students take turns reading aloud a sentence or paragraph to the class.</p>
