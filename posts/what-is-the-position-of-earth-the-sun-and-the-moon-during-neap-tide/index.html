<h2 id=what-is-the-position-of-earth-the-sun-and-the-moon-during-neap-tide>What is the position of Earth the sun and the moon during neap tide?</h2>
<p>Neap tides occur when the Earth, the Sun, and the Moon form a right angle, at first and last quarters for the Moon. The Moon’s gravity is mostly responsible for our tides, but the Sun also plays a role (Figure 14.13). The Sun is much larger than our Moon. It has a mass about 27,500,000 times greater than the Moon.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-moon-located-during-a-spring-tide>Where is the moon located during a spring tide?</h2>
<p>A perigean spring tide occurs when the moon is either new or full and closest to Earth. Often between 6-8 times a year, the new or full moon coincides closely in time with the perigee of the moon — the point when the moon is closest to the Earth. These occurrences are often called ‘perigean spring tides.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-position-of-the-moon-during-high-tide>What is the position of the moon during high tide?</h2>
<p>High tides and low tides are caused by the moon. The moon’s gravitational pull generates something called the tidal force. The tidal force causes Earth—and its water—to bulge out on the side closest to the moon and the side farthest from the moon. These bulges of water are high tides.</p>
<h2 id=what-positions-are-the-sun-moon-and-earth-in-during-spring-tides>What positions are the sun moon and Earth in during spring tides?</h2>
<p>When, however, the sun and moon are 90° apart, or in quadrature, each produces a tide on the portion of the earth directly under it, diminishing somewhat that produced by the other body. High tide, then, occurs under the moon, while the high tide caused by the sun, becomes, by comparison, a low tide.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-neap-tide-occur-in-the-us>When does the neap tide occur in the US?</h2>
<p>Neap tides occur during the first and third quarter moon, when the moon appears “half full.”. NOAA’s tide and tidal current predictions take into account astronomical considerations due to the position of the moon and the sun.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-a-high-tide-occur-under-the-moon>When does a high tide occur under the Moon?</h2>
<p>High tide, then, occurs under the moon, while the high tide caused by the sun, becomes, by comparison, a low tide. Such tides are called neap tides. During their prevalence, the flood is not very high, nor the ebb very low.</p>

<p>When, however, the sun and moon are 90° apart, or in quadrature, each produces a tide on the portion of the earth directly under it, diminishing somewhat that produced by the other body.

<h2 id=what-happens-7-days-after-a-spring-tide>What happens 7 days after a spring tide?</h2>
<p>A neap tide —seven days after a spring tide—refers to a period of moderate tides when the sun and moon are at right angles to each other. Seven days after a spring tide, the sun and moon are at right angles to each other. When this happens, the bulge of the ocean caused by the sun partially cancels out the bulge of the ocean caused by the moon.</p>
