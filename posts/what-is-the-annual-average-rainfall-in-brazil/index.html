<h2 id=what-is-the-annual-average-rainfall-in-brazil>What is the annual average rainfall in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Most of Brazil has moderate rainfall of between 1,000 and 1,500 mm (39 and 59 in) a year, with most of the rain falling in the summer (between December and April) south of the Equator.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-temperature-of-the-rainforest-in-brazil>What is the average temperature of the rainforest in Brazil?</h2>
<p>The rainforest biome remains warm all year and must stay frost-free. The average daily temperatures range from 20°C (68°F) to 25°C (77°F).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-rainfall-per-month-in-brazil>What is the average rainfall per month in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Rainfall amounts to 2,300 mm (90 in) per year, including more than 200 mm (8 in) per month from December to May, while from July to September, there’s a drier period, with less than 100 mm (4 in) per month.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-rain-every-year-in-the-brazilian-rainforest>How much does it rain every year in the Brazilian rainforest?</h2>
<p>While the average annual rainfall is almost 120 inches, some areas can get nearly 400 inches of rain a year. Much of the rain falls between October and May.</p>
<h2 id=which-city-has-the-maximum-range-of-temperature-how-much-is-it-in-brazil>Which city has the maximum range of temperature How much is it in Brazil?</h2>
<p>(iv) Porto Alegre has the highest range of temperature, ranging from 30 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. (v) Rio de Janeiro has a tropical savannah climate.</p>
<h2 id=how-cold-is-winter-in-brazil>How cold is winter in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Rio winters are quite mild, with nighttime temperatures dropping as low as 19°C (66°F), and daytime temperatures climbing to the pleasant and sunny 30°C (86°F). Cariocas themselves find this lack of heat appalling, and will often throw on a coat or heavy sweater when the temperature drops below 21°C (70°F).</p>
<h2 id=does-brazil-have-4-seasons>Does Brazil have 4 seasons?</h2>
<p>As Brazil lies in the Southern Hemisphere, its seasons are the exact opposite of what Northern Hemisphere residents are used to: summer is December through March and winter June through September. Within the country the climate varies considerably from region to region. In most of Brazil the summers are very hot.</p>
<h2 id=does-brazil-have-winter>Does Brazil have winter?</h2>
<p>Winter in Brazil is the opposite of the Northern Hemisphere and lasts from May to September. In the north of Brazil, the weather remains positively tropical with days averaging between mid 20s to low 30°C (68 to 86°F) .</p>
