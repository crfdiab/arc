<h2 id=can-you-sue-for-freedom-of-speech>Can you sue for freedom of speech?</h2>
<p>The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads: If you work for a private employer you may not sue your employer for violating your free speech rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, “Constitution”, not to be confused with the constitutions of individual states.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-court-cases-that-limit-your-rights-as-a-citizen>What are two court cases that limit your rights as a citizen?</h2>
<p>10 Supreme Court cases about the 14th Amendment</p>

<li>Plessy v. Ferguson (18 May 1896) ―The Louisiana legislature had passed a law requiring black and white residents to ride separate, but equal, train cars.</li>

<h2 id=can-a-court-stop-the-press-from-reporting-on-a-criminal-trial>Can a court stop the press from reporting on a criminal trial?</h2>
<p>The problems caused by pre-trial publicity can be addressed by the court in a number of ways. Despite the biasing effect of pre-trial publicity, the Supreme Court has ruled that courts cannot stop the press from publicizing truthful information about criminal trials, as doing so would violate the First Amendment right to freedom of the press.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-trial-by-media-before-courts>What happens to trial by media before courts?</h2>
<p>Parties have a constitutional right to have a fair trial in the court of law, by an impartial tribunal, uninfluenced by newspaper dictation or popular Glamour. What would happen to this right if the press may use such a language as to influence and control the judicial process?</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-media-affect-a-criminal-case>How does the media affect a criminal case?</h2>
<p>Police officers involved in criminal cases may become entangled with the media in the process of providing information about a case. Media coverage of a trial, especially television cameras in the courtroom, can affect the behavior of witnesses and jurors. Minow & Cate, “Who is an Impartial Juror in an Age of Mass Media?” (2.1MB PDF)</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-internet-affect-a-criminal-trial>How does the Internet affect a criminal trial?</h2>
<p>An additional challenge with the internet is that posts have a much longer lifetime, and there are many more opinions being presented – not just facts of the case. All of this accessibility can cause conflict between the First and Sixth Amendments.</p>
