<h2 id=what-brought-the-united-states-out-of-the-great-depression-economics>What brought the United States out of the Great Depression Economics?</h2>
<p>It is commonly argued that World War II provided the stimulus that brought the American economy out of the Great Depression. The number of unemployed workers declined by 7,050,000 between 1940 and 1943, but the number in military service rose by 8,590,000.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-us-economy-after-the-great-depression>What happened to the US economy after the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>In the United States, where the Depression was generally worst, industrial production between 1929 and 1933 fell by nearly 47 percent, gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 30 percent, and unemployment reached more than 20 percent.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-economy-recover-from-the-great-depression>How did the economy recover from the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>The immediate cause of the recession that became the Great Depression was the collapse of private investment. The economy recovered from the Depression only with the advent of World War II which pushed demand for goods and services to the limit of its capacity.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-depression-affect-the-economy>How did the Great Depression affect the economy?</h2>
<p>If we can answer it, we can better grasp what perpetuates economic stagnation and what cures it. The Great Depression was the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. From 1931 to 1940 unemployment was always in double digits. In April 1939, almost ten years after the crisis began, more than one in five Americans still could not find work.</p>

<p>The Great Depression was the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. From 1931 to 1940 unemployment was always in double digits. In April 1939, almost ten years after the crisis began, more than one in five Americans still could not find work. On the surface World War II seems to mark the end of the Great Depression.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-were-unemployed-during-the-great-depression>How many people were unemployed during the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>During the war, more than 12 million Americans were sent into the military, and a similar number toiled in defense-related jobs. Those war jobs seemingly took care of the 17 million unemployed in 1939.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-fed-do-during-the-great-depression>What did the Fed do during the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>Created in 1913, the Fed remained inactive throughout the first eight years of its existence. After the economy recovered from the 1920 to 1921 depression, the Fed allowed significant monetary expansion. Total money supply grew by $28 billion, a 61.8% increase between 1921 and 1928.</p>
