<h2 id=what-countries-is-arizona-bigger-than>What countries is Arizona bigger than?</h2>
<p>At 113,990 square miles, Arizona is a big state — the 6th largest by area, to be exact. In fact, Arizona is larger than many countries. If it were a country, it would rank as the 73rd largest, unseating Ecuador.</p>
<h2 id=is-alaska-half-the-size-of-the-us>Is Alaska half the size of the US?</h2>
<p>At 663,300 square miles, Alaska is by far the largest state in the United States, nearly two and a half times as large as Texas. In the case of many map projections, Alaska appears to be more than half the size of the lower 48 states, when in reality the continental US is 4.7 times as large.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-times-bigger-is-alaska-than-florida>How many times bigger is Alaska than Florida?</h2>
<p>Alaska is about 11 times bigger than Florida. Florida is approximately 139,670 sq km, while Alaska is approximately 1,481,348 sq km, making Alaska 961% larger than Florida. Meanwhile, the population of Florida is ~18.8 million people (18.1 million fewer people live in Alaska).</p>
<h2 id=what-country-is-the-same-size-as-arizona>What country is the same size as Arizona?</h2>
<p>Italy is around the same size as Arizona. Arizona is approximately 294,312 sq km, while Italy is approximately 301,340 sq km, making Italy 2% larger than Arizona.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-states-are-in-the-state-of-alaska>How many states are in the state of Alaska?</h2>
<p>In this map by Metric Maps, spotted by Digg, 19 different U.S. states can fit into Alaska, the nation’s largest state by area. Not just the smaller states, either. Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia can all fit inside Alaska with room to spare. But as you might suspect, much of that landmass is virtually uninhabited.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-states-that-can-fit-inside-alaska>Are there any states that can fit inside Alaska?</h2>
<p>Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia can all fit inside Alaska with room to spare. But as you might suspect, much of that landmass is virtually uninhabited. Alaska is the 47th most-populated state in the U.S. Know of something you think we should cover? Email us at <a href=mailto:tips@mentalfloss.com>tips@mentalfloss.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-alaska-compared-to-other-countries>How big is Alaska compared to other countries?</h2>
<p>Additionally, Alaska’s Little Diomede Island and Russia’s Big Diomede Island are only three miles apart, meaning that US and Russian territorial waters touch. With an area of 663,268, Alaska is twice the size of Texas, which is the second-largest US state. In fact, only 18 sovereign countries are larger than Alaska.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-alaska-become-part-of-the-united-states>When did Alaska become part of the United States?</h2>
<p>Alaska was admitted into the Union on January 3, 1959, becoming the 49th US state. The name “Alaska” has been used since the Russian colonial period when it referred to the Alaska Peninsula.</p>
