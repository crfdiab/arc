<h2 id=how-did-the-2004-tsunami-recover>How did the 2004 tsunami recover?</h2>
<p>Rebuilding and replanting Home-building was a major component of the recovery effort and 140,000 homes were built. Over half those living in heavily-damaged communities have benefited directly from housing assistance and 90% of households in those areas own their homes today.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-recover-from-the-sumatra-tsunami>How did people recover from the Sumatra tsunami?</h2>
<p>Five years after the massive Indian Ocean tsunami, which left a devastating trail of death and destruction, millions of people have benefited from the influx of aid by rebuilding stronger infrastructure, social services and disaster warning systems than existed before the catastrophe, according to the United Nations …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-done-to-try-and-rebuild-after-the-2004-tsunami>What was done to try and rebuild after the 2004 tsunami?</h2>
<p>Shaped like an eyelid in a halo of azure water, the tiny Indian Ocean island of Dhuvaafaru in the Maldives is a fresh-minted community that has been transplanted to the Raa atoll. Clinics, schools and roads have all been built from scratch.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-so-many-people-die-in-the-indian-ocean-tsunami>Why did so many people die in the Indian Ocean tsunami?</h2>
<p>The Indian Ocean tsunami was the most deadly in recorded history. Why did so many people die on December 26, 2004? Dense coastal populations combined with a lack of tsunami-warning infrastructure came together to produce this horrific result.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-no-warning-after-the-tsunami>Why was there no warning after the tsunami?</h2>
<p>Even after the tsunami hit the east coast, no official action was taken to alert people elsewhere. In relatively shallow water, the wave took up to an hour to sweep around the island and hit the south and west coasts.</p>

<p>These photos revisit the devastation in Banda Aceh, the coastal town hit hardest by the 2004 tsunami triggered by an earthquake</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-tsunami-hit-on-the-east-coast>Where did the tsunami hit on the east coast?</h2>
<p>The huge tremor, which immediately destroyed buildings throughout the province of Aceh, was followed within half an hour by the tsunami that hit the west coast. It then curled around the northern tip, flattening the provincial capital of Banda Aceh, and proceeded down the east coast.</p>
