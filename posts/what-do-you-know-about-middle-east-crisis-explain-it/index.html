<h2 id=what-do-you-know-about-middle-east-crisis-explain-it>What do you know about Middle East crisis explain it?</h2>
<p>A crisis has erupted between Iran and Western countries – in particular the UK and US – after a series of incidents in and around the Gulf, a strategically important waterway in the Middle East. Both sides are blaming the other and there are fears it could lead to war.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-oil-mostly-found-in-the-middle-east>Why is oil mostly found in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>The most widely accepted theory for why the Middle East is loaded with oil is that the region was not always a vast desert. The oil was captured in place on the seabed by thick layers of salt. As the land in the modern Middle East region rose due to tectonic activity, the Tethys Ocean receded.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-problems-in-the-middle-east>Why are there problems in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>A suppressed people that sees US influence as a major root cause of the current problems in the Middle East has led to a rise in Islamic militancy, acts of terrorism and anti-west sentiment, anti-US in particular. When looking at some of the actions of the US, it can often be seen why this is unfortunately so. Posted Tuesday, September 18, 2001.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-middle-east-crisis-a-political-or-spiritual-crisis>Is the Middle East crisis a political or spiritual crisis?</h2>
<p>Much has been written about the Middle East crisis from a political perspective, but it will never be understood apart from its spiritual roots, for it is, from start to finish, a spiritual conflict — which is why it will never be settled politically. The controlling factor spiritually is a promise which God made to Abraham almost 4,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-crisis-in-the-middle-east-in-1979>What was the crisis in the Middle East in 1979?</h2>
<p>In all, the events of 1979 have created awesome problems for the Middle East and for American policy in the region.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-water-crisis-affecting-the-middle-east>How is the water crisis affecting the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Water – or rather the lack of it – has driven several geopolitical crises, diverting resources from one country to another and destabilising agrarian communities, including in Egypt, Iraq and Jordan.</p>
