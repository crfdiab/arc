<h2 id=who-started-war-of-1812>Who started War of 1812?</h2>
<p>Great Britain<br>
In the War of 1812, caused by British restrictions on U.S. trade and America’s desire to expand its territory, the United States took on the greatest naval power in the world, Great Britain.</p>
<h2 id=what-role-did-france-play-in-the-war-of-1812>What role did France play in the War of 1812?</h2>
<p>The immediate causes of the War of 1812 were a series of economic sanctions taken by the British and French against the US as part of the Napoleonic Wars and American outrage at the British practice of impressment, especially after the Chesapeake incident of 1807.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-french-help-in-the-war-of-1812>Did the French help in the War of 1812?</h2>
<p>Additionally, Great Britain was allied at the time with Spain against France and its powerful military under Napoleon, and thus Spain supported Britain in the Americas while France fought against the forces of both. By some estimates, from 1793 to 1812 over 15,000 men were forced into British service in this way.</p>

<h2 id=why-was-the-war-of-1812-between-england-and-france>Why was the war of 1812 between England and France?</h2>
<p>The War of 1812 was part of a larger conflict that stemmed between England and France. From 1789-1815 England and France were locked in a constant power struggle for global superiority. America joined the conflict for a few reasons, many felt that the British had not yet come to honor the United States as an authorized country.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-war-of-1812-start-and-end>When did the war of 1812 start and end?</h2>
<p>The War of 1812 began on June 18th, 1812 with the Unites States formally declaring war on the United Kingdom. The war lasted from June 1812-February 1815, a span of two years and eight months . WHO declared the War of 1812?</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-battle-of-new-orleans-affect-the-war-of-1812>How did the Battle of New Orleans affect the war of 1812?</h2>
<p>Read more about the Battle of New Orleans. Did the War of 1812 have popular support? The War of 1812 had only mixed support on both sides of the Atlantic. The British weren’t eager for another conflict, having fought Napoleon for the better part of the previous 20 years, but weren’t fond of American commercial support of the French either.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-us-attack-canada-in-the-war-of-1812>Why did the US attack Canada in the war of 1812?</h2>
<p>The United States attacked Canada because it was British, but no widespread aspiration existed to incorporate the region. The prospect of taking East and West Florida from Spain encouraged southern support for the war, but southerners, like westerners, were sensitive about the United States’s reputation in the world.</p>
