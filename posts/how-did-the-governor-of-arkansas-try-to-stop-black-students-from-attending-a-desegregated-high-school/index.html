<h2 id=how-did-the-governor-of-arkansas-try-to-stop-black-students-from-attending-a-desegregated-high-school>How did the governor of Arkansas try to stop black students from attending a desegregated high school?</h2>
<p>On September 4, 1957, the first day of classes at Central High, Governor Orval Faubus called in the Arkansas National Guard to block the black students’ entry into the high school. Eisenhower sent in federal troops to escort the Little Rock Nine into the school. It drew national attention to the civil rights movement.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-governor-faubus-of-arkansas-oppose-desegregation>Why did Governor Faubus of Arkansas oppose desegregation?</h2>
<p>Although Faubus insisted that his only motive was to prevent violence, not to block integration, the moment he dispatched the National Guard to Central High he became a hero to segregationists and easily the most popular politician in Arkansas.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-school-segregation-end-in-arkansas>When did school segregation end in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>Although the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock in 1957 and the story of the Little Rock Nine are well known and documented in the state’s history, some educational facilities in Arkansas had been desegregated earlier.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-responsible-for-blocking-the-little-rock-nine-from-attending-a-desegregated-school>Who was responsible for blocking the Little Rock Nine from attending a desegregated school?</h2>
<p>Orval Faubus<br>
The Little Rock Nine was a group of nine African American students enrolled in Little Rock Central High School in 1957. Their enrollment was followed by the Little Rock Crisis, in which the students were initially prevented from entering the racially segregated school by Orval Faubus, the Governor of Arkansas.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-supreme-court-hear-brown-v-board-of-education>Why did the Supreme Court hear Brown v Board of Education?</h2>
<p>In this milestone decision, the Supreme Court ruled that separating children in public schools on the basis of race was unconstitutional. It signaled the end of legalized racial segregation in the schools of the United States, overruling the “separate but equal” principle set forth in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-governor-of-arkansas-who-prevented-desegregation>Who was the Governor of Arkansas who prevented desegregation?</h2>
<p>Arkansas troops prevent desegregation. Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus enlists the National Guard to prevent nine African American students from entering Central High School in Little Rock.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-desegregation-of-arkansas-schools-happen>When did the desegregation of Arkansas schools happen?</h2>
<p>Desegregation did not lead to full integration. Desegregation efforts in Arkansas were not limited to schools. In the 1960s, black students from Philander Smith College attempted to desegregate the Woolworth’s lunch counter in downtown Little Rock. They succeeded in 1963.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-segregation-declared-unconstitutional-in-public-schools>When was segregation declared unconstitutional in public schools?</h2>
<p>Board of Education, a landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling that declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional. On September 4, 1957, the first day of classes at Central High, Governor Orval Faubus called in the Arkansas National Guard to block the black students’ entry into the high school.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-central-high-school-in-little-rock-desegregated>When was Central High School in Little Rock desegregated?</h2>
<p>Although the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock in 1957 and the story of the Little Rock Nine are well known and documented in the state’s history, some educational facilities in Arkansas had been desegregated earlier.</p>
