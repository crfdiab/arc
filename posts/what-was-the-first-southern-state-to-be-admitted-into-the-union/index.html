<p>South Carolina was the first state to secede from the Union in December 1860, and was one of the founding member states of the Confederacy in February 1861….South Carolina in the American Civil War.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1868, seven former Confederate states–Alabama (July 13, 1868), Arkansas (June 22, 1868), Florida (June 25, 1868), Georgia* (July 21, 1868), Louisiana (July 9, 1868), North Carolina (July 4, 1868), and South Carolina (July 9, 1868) are readmitted to the Union.</p>
