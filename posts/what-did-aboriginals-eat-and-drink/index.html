<h2 id=what-did-aboriginals-eat-and-drink>What did aboriginals eat and drink?</h2>
<p>Aboriginal people ate a large variety of plant foods such as fruits, nuts, roots, vegetables, grasses and seeds, as well as different meats such as kangaroos, ‘porcupine’7, emus, possums, goannas, turtles, shellfish and fish.</p>
<h2 id=did-aboriginals-drink-before>Did Aboriginals drink before?</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that Europeans brought a culture of brewing and consuming alcohol during their early migration and colonisation of Australia, but new evidence reveals Aboriginal people were already aware of fermentation processes.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-drink-at-14-in-australia>Can you drink at 14 in Australia?</h2>
<p>Laws that apply anywhere in Australia Legal drinking age – you must be 18 or older to buy alcohol or to drink alcohol in a licensed venue. Selling alcohol – it’s illegal to sell alcohol to anyone under 18 or to someone who is already drunk.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-aboriginal-people-use-to-make-sweet-drinks>What did Aboriginal people use to make sweet drinks?</h2>
<p>Banksia: People placed the flower spike in a paperbark -lined hole filled with water to make a sweet drink. Grevillea: Nectar shaken and eaten, or mixed with water to make a sweet drink. Xanthorrhoea: Sweet drink from nectar by soaking in water.</p>
<h2 id=what-foods-did-the-arrernte-aboriginal-people-eat>What foods did the Arrernte Aboriginal people eat?</h2>
<p>Many other groups also do this or did this traditionally. The Arrernte word for sweet foods is Ngkwarle — honey-like foods. Some Aboriginal people who still have their language often refer to alcohol by this sweet food group term. Ironwood gum is broken off tree branches.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-aboriginal-people-make-their-cider>How did the Aboriginal people make their cider?</h2>
<p>In the past, Aboriginal people tapped the trees to allow the sap, resembling maple syrup, to collect in hollows in the bark or at the base of the tree. Ever-present yeast would ferment the liquid to an alcoholic, cider-like beverage that the local Aboriginal people referred to as Way-a-linah.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-alcohol-affect-aboriginal-people-in-australia>How does alcohol affect Aboriginal people in Australia?</h2>
<p>Percentage of Aboriginal Australian drinkers experiencing some alcohol-related harm. Same figure for non-Aboriginal drinkers: 35% [6]. Number of times Aboriginal people are more likely to drink alcohol at risky levels [1]. Percentage of Aboriginal Australians who binge drink. Same figure for non-Indigenous Australians: 8% [2].</p>
