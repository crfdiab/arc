<h2 id=what-did-ponce-de-león-discover>What did Ponce de León discover?</h2>
<p>Why is Juan Ponce de León famous? Juan Ponce de León was a Spanish explorer. In 1508–09 he explored and settled Puerto Rico, founding the colony’s oldest settlement, Caparra, near what is now San Juan. He is also credited with being the first European to reach Florida (1513).</p>

<p>While Ponce de León grew quite wealthy from his plantations and mines, he faced an ongoing legal conflict with Diego Columbus, the late Christopher Columbus’s son, over the right to govern Puerto Rico. After a long court battle, Columbus replaced Ponce de León as governor in 1511.</p>

<p>Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León led a European expedition for gold, which eventually brought him to the southeast coast of what would become the United States. He gave Florida its name and went on to become the first governor of Puerto Rico. Ponce de León was born into a poor yet noble family in Santervás de Campos, Spain, in 1460.</p>

<p>Ponce de León’s governorship was later validated by King Ferdinand of Spain, but in 1511, a Spanish court ruled in favor of Columbus. Ponce de León had many friends, and Columbus couldn’t get rid of him completely, but it was apparent that Columbus was going to win the legal battle for San Juan Bautista.</p>

<p>In February 1521, Ponce de León departed San Juan on his second expedition to Florida, accompanied by two ships and around 200 people. They landed on the southwest coast of Florida, near what is now Charlotte Harbor, with the intention of founding a colony.</p>

<p>By June 1511 the Taínos were pushed to a short-lived rebellion, which was forcibly put down by Ponce de León and a small force of troops armed with crossbows and arquebuses. Even as Ponce de León was settling the island of San Juan, significant changes were taking place in the politics and government of the Spanish West Indies.</p>
