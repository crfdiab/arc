<h2 id=how-does-the-rule-of-law-work-in-australia>How does the rule of law work in Australia?</h2>
<p>The rule of law restricts the powers of governments, corporations and individuals, and protects against the exercise of power without a lawful basis. The laws of Australia apply to everyone, including Government Ministers, Parliamentarians and Judges.</p>
<h2 id=who-has-to-obey-the-laws-in-australia>Who has to obey the laws in Australia?</h2>
<p>All Australians are equal under the law. No person, group or religion is above the law. Everyone, including people who hold positions of power in the Australian community, must obey Australia’s laws.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-law-australia>What is the purpose of law Australia?</h2>
<p>Why do we have laws? We have laws so that society can work effectively, to make sure that people or organisations are not able to use power, money or strength to take advantage of others or to make things better for themselves.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-break-a-law-in-australia>What happens if you break a law in Australia?</h2>
<p>If you break the law, you could be arrested and jailed. You’ll have to work with the local legal and prison systems. The Australian Government is committed to bringing Australians to justice when they commit crimes overseas.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-types-of-laws-in-australia>What are the two types of laws in Australia?</h2>
<p>There are two main sources of law in Australia, case law or common law, based on the decisions of judges in the superior courts, and legislation, the law made by Parliament.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-rule-of-law-explain>What is the rule of law explain?</h2>
<p>Rule of law, the mechanism, process, institution, practice, or norm that supports the equality of all citizens before the law, secures a nonarbitrary form of government, and more generally prevents the arbitrary use of power.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-laws-in-australia>Why are there so many laws in Australia?</h2>
<p>Australian laws follow the same mandate that all the citizens must abide by the set rules and regulations or suffer the consequences. But there are strange laws that are in effect even though there is absolutely no reason behind them.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-abide-by-australian-laws>Do you have to abide by Australian laws?</h2>
<p>Australian citizens are bound to abide by Australian laws as the citizens of any country are. However, these laws are not well-known enough that sometimes the citizen might not even know the reason why the got in trouble with the authorities. Also See : Why Have a Wedding in Australia?</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-rule-of-law-upheld-in-australia>How is the rule of law upheld in Australia?</h2>
<p>The rule of law underpins the way Australian society is governed. Everyone – including citizens and the government – is bound by and entitled to the benefit of laws. We uphold the rule of law through our daily work to ensure: laws are publicly made and the community is able to participate in the law-making process</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-legal-system-in-australia-before-colonisation>What was the legal system in Australia before colonisation?</h2>
<p>Prior to colonisation, the only systems of law to exist in Australia were the varied systems of customary law belonging to Indigenous Australians. Indigenous systems of law were deliberately ignored by the colonial legal system, and in the post-colonial era have only been recognised as legally important by Australian courts to a limited degree.</p>
