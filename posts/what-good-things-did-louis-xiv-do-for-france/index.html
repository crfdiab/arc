<h2 id=what-good-things-did-louis-xiv-do-for-france>What good things did Louis XIV do for France?</h2>
<p>He brought the French monarchy to its peak of absolute power and made France the dominant power in Europe. His reign is also associated with the greatest age of French culture and art.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-king-louis-xiv-positively-influence-france>How did King Louis XIV positively influence France?</h2>
<p>Upon becoming the de facto ruler of France after the death of Cardinal Mazarin, Louis implemented a wide range of reforms to make his country financially and militarily strong. He led France in several major wars and by the middle of his reign he had established his country as the most powerful nation in Europe.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-louis-xiv-and-what-did-he-do>What was Louis XIV, and what did he do?</h2>

<h2 id=how-did-the-french-revolution-affect-other-countries>How did the French Revolution affect other countries?</h2>
<p>The French Revolution is often referred to as a watershed event because it had a profound effect on France, as well as other European countries.
