<h2 id=what-is-an-imaginary-line-that-runs-from-the-north-pole-to-the-south-pole>What is an imaginary line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole?</h2>
<p>The Equator<br>
The Equator is the invisible line that runs around the center of the Earth at 0 degrees latitude. An equator is an imaginary line around the middle of a planet or other celestial body. It is halfway between the North Pole and the South Pole, at 0 degrees latitude.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-imaginary-line-from-north-to-south>What is the imaginary line from North to south?</h2>
<p>meridian. one of the imaginary lines that goes around the Earth from the North Pole to the South Pole.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-imaginary-line-that-divides-the-earth-called>What is the imaginary line that divides the Earth called?</h2>
<p>The Equator, or line of 0 degrees latitude, divides the Earth into the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The prime meridian, or 0 degrees longitude, and the International Date Line, 180 degrees longitude, divide the Earth into Eastern and Western hemispheres.</p>
<h2 id=what-term-is-used-for-the-imaginary-horizontal-lines-on-the-earth>What term is used for the imaginary horizontal lines on the Earth?</h2>
<p>parallels<br>
Imaginary horizontal mapping lines on the Earth. They are known as “parallels” of latitude because they run parallel to the Equator.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-imaginary-lines-moves-runs-north-to-south>Which of the following imaginary lines moves runs north to south?</h2>
<p>meridians<br>
Longitude is measured by imaginary lines that run around the Earth vertically (up and down) and meet at the North and South Poles. These lines are known as meridians. Each meridian measures one arcdegree of longitude.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-used-for-the-imaginary-east-west-horizontal-lines-on-the-earth>What is used for the imaginary east-west horizontal lines on the Earth?</h2>
<p>Parallels: Latitude is the altitude measurement to the north or south of the Equator. It is determined by 180 imaginary lines forming arcs east-west around the Earth, parallel to the Equator. Such lines are referred to as meridians. Each meridian measures one degree of longitude per arc.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-imaginary-line-encircling-the-earth-which-is-0-latitude>What is an imaginary line encircling the Earth which is 0 latitude?</h2>
<p>These lines are known as parallels. A circle of latitude is an imaginary ring linking all points sharing a parallel. The Equator is the line of 0 degrees latitude. Each parallel measures one degree north or south of the Equator, with 90 degrees north of the Equator and 90 degrees south of the Equator.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-imaginary-lines-that-run-from-the-north-to-south-pole>What are the imaginary lines that run from the north to South Pole?</h2>
<p>The imaginary vertical lines that run from the North pole to the South pole on a map are called longitudinal lines. The Prime Meridian is the longitudinal line that has a value of 0 degrees.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-imaginary-line-that-goes-around-the-earth-called>What is the imaginary line that goes around the Earth called?</h2>
<p>Longitude is measured by imaginary lines that run around the Earth vertically (up and down) and meet at the North and South Poles. These lines are known as meridians.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-prime-meridian-at-the-north-or-south-pole>Is the prime meridian at the north or South Pole?</h2>
<p>A (geographic) meridian (or line of longitude) is the half of an imaginary great circle on the Earth’s surface, terminated by the North Pole and the South Pole, connecting points of equal longitude, as measured in angular degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-north-and-south-lines-on-the-globe>What are the north and south lines on the globe?</h2>
<p>North-south lines on the globe are Longitude, or Meridians. East-west lines on the globe are Latitude. The line at zero degrees longitude, through Greenwich, England, is the Prime Meridian.</p>
