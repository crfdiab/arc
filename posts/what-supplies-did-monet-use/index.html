<h2 id=what-supplies-did-monet-use>What supplies did Monet use?</h2>
<p>Monet worked primarily in oil paint, but he also used pastels and carried a sketchbook. He used quite a limited range of colors in his paintings, banishing browns and earth colors from his palette.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-monet-interested-in>What was Monet interested in?</h2>
<p>He was more interested in being outside. At an early age, Monet developed a love of drawing. Boudin introduced him to painting outdoors, or plein air painting, which would later become the cornerstone of Monet’s work. In 1859, Monet decided to move to Paris to pursue his art.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-monet-grow-in-his-garden>What did Monet grow in his garden?</h2>
<p>With the help of his family and six gardeners, Monet planted, nurtured and composed his garden — a world of flowers made up of yellow, pink and red roses arrayed on the ground and draping over metal arches; patches of bright red geraniums; pale purple lavender; deep purple pansies; irises; impatiens; peonies and more.</p>

<p>Monet was exceptionally fond of painting controlled nature: his own gardens in Giverny, with its water lilies, pond, and bridge. He also painted up and down the banks of the Seine. Between 1883 and 1908, Monet traveled to the Mediterranean, where he painted landmarks, landscapes, and seascapes, such as Bordighera.</p>

<p>False Answer is true!!!</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-famous-part-of-monets-garden->What was the most famous part of Monet’s garden *?</h2>
<p>water garden<br>
The Flower Gardens – The Clos Normand The water garden may be the most famous part of Monet’s garden and will be particularly interesting to fans of Monet’s wonderful water lily paintings but for me it was the flower borders in front of the house that completely bowled me over. This garden is quite simply stunning.</p>
<h2 id=which-medium-of-color-did-monet-prefer>Which medium of color did Monet prefer?</h2>
<p>Answer: Impressionist art is based on the use of colour , which has to “draw” the motive without resorting to line. At the beginning of his career , Monet used dark colours , as he did in the ‘Studio corner ‘ marked by black shades . His painting evokes Courbet and the realist School.</p>

<p>Monet was also passionate about gardening. When he created the Clos Normand he transferred all his knowledge about color, light, and perspective from his paintings to his garden. The main path of Clos Normand is covered with metallic arches on which roses grow. Straight lines and groups of colors dominate the whole garden.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-house-of-claude-monet-located>Where was the House of Claude Monet located?</h2>
<p>Claude Monet discovered the house in Giverny, Normandy, while looking out of a train window during a trip from Vernon to Gasny. He immediately fell in love with the place.</p>
