<h2 id=is-south-africa-the-best-country-in-the-world>Is South Africa the best country in the world?</h2>
<p>South Africa, its cities, and its citizens win plenty of international awards each year. In 2017, South Africa was voted the 5th Most Beautiful Country in the World, while Cape Town was named the World’s Best City to Visit. In 2019, three South African universities are among the top 500 in the world.</p>

<h2 id=why-is-south-africa-important-to-the-united-states>Why is South Africa important to the United States?</h2>
<p>South Africa is a strategic partner of the United States, particularly in the areas of health, security, and digital economy. The two countries share development objectives throughout Africa, and South Africa plays a key economic and political role on the African continent.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-south-africa-become-a-better-place>How did South Africa become a better place?</h2>
<p>Using South Africa as a case study, it – like the world – has become a fundamentally better place as time progresses. Our GDP is 2.5 times the size it was in 1994 on a dollar basis; formal housing has increased by 131% from 1996 to 2016; new HIV infections are down 60% from 1999-2016; and the murder rate per 100,000 is down 50% from 1994 to 2017.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-united-states-and-south-africa-the-same-country>Is the United States and South Africa the same country?</h2>
<p>South Africa and the United States belong to a number of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, G-20, and World Trade Organization. South Africa will serve as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council from January 1, 2019, until December 31, 2020.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-good-to-be-an-american-in-south-africa>Is it good to be an American in South Africa?</h2>
<p>While South Africa is a nation of change and forward progress, it still has some work to do in terms of its inclusivity for all members of its population. As an American student, you will experience mostly warm hospitality and there is a good chance many South Africans will be interested in talking to you about your experiences.</p>
