<p>Cook’s career as an explorer began in August 1768, when he left England on HM Bark Endeavour with nearly 100 crewmen in tow. Their journey was ostensibly a scientific expedition—they were charged with sailing to Tahiti to observe the transit of Venus across the face of the sun—but it also had a hidden military agenda.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-captain-cook-a-great-explorer>Why was Captain Cook a great explorer?</h2>
<p>He became the first European to set foot in Hawaii. Then, he charted the west coast of North America from California to the Bering Strait. On his return to Hawaii in 1779, a contretemps with the natives resulted in Cook’s death at their hands.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-james-cook-explore-the-ocean>Why did James Cook explore the ocean?</h2>
<p>The primary objective of Cook’s first expedition was to improve oceanic navigation by charting the transit of Venus from Tahiti. When Cook set sail on the HMS Endeavour from Plymouth harbor in August 1768, he was joined by the naturalist Joseph Banks (1743 – 1820) and his civilian entourage.</p>

<h2 id=why-did-james-cook-want-to-explore-venus>Why did James Cook want to explore Venus?</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of his first expedition, which was to Tahiti, was to observe the planet Venus as a small black dot while it passed between the Earth and the sun. Cook wanted to observe Venus in order to help him calculate the distance between the sun and the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-james-cook-do-in-new-zealand>What did James Cook do in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>James Cook was a naval captain, navigator and explorer who, in 1770, charted New Zealand and the Great Barrier Reef of Australia on his ship HMB Endeavour. He later disproved the existence of Terra…</p>
