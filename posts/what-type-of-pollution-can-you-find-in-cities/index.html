<h2 id=what-type-of-pollution-can-you-find-in-cities>What type of pollution can you find in cities?</h2>
<p>There are different types of pollution: water pollution, air pollution, solid waste pollution and noise pollution. All of these can be found in urban areas. The main sources of pollution are household activities, factories, agriculture and transport.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-city-pollution>What is city pollution?</h2>
<p>Cities are major contributors to climate change. According to UN Habitat, cities consume 78 per cent of the world’s energy and produce more than 60 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, they account for less than 2 per cent of the Earth’s surface.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-pollution-in-a-city>What causes pollution in a city?</h2>
<p>The sources of air pollution are intrinsically linked to how we live in cities. While many people see cars and transport as the most obvious causes of air pollution, nearly 70% of particulate matter is related to the built environment such as heating of buildings, construction and traffic related to it.</p>

<h2 id=what-are-some-examples-of-pollution-in-cities>What are some examples of pollution in cities?</h2>
<p>Our cities are often polluted with signs, advertisements and overly illuminated billboard lights that are often unattractive causing an eyesore. Visual pollution can also lower or degrade living standards lifestyle, and property values.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-air-pollution-data-come-from>Where does the air pollution data come from?</h2>
<p>Where does the data come from? WHO’s Global Platform on Air Quality and Health combines ground station monitoring with satellite data for a comprehensive view of air pollution levels in over 4000 cities and its impact on our health in every country in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-environmental-pollution>What are the different types of environmental pollution?</h2>
<p>When you think of environmental pollution, it typically comes in seven different types. These include air, water, land, radioactive, thermal, light, and sound pollution. Explore the definition and causes of each type of pollution. In some cities, the air is dangerous to breathe. Why? Well, air pollution of course.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-deaths-are-caused-by-air-pollution>How many deaths are caused by air pollution?</h2>
<p>WHO’s Global Platform on Air Quality and Health combines ground station monitoring with satellite data for a comprehensive view of air pollution levels in over 4000 cities and its impact on our health in every country in the world. Air pollution causes 1 in 9 deaths worldwide, but we have the solutions to change that.</p>
