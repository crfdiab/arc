<h2 id=what-day-of-the-week-is-best-to-fly>What day of the week is best to fly?</h2>
<p>In a nutshell: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are the best days to fly domestically. Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday are the days with the highest cost and lowest number of award seats.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-safest-time-of-day-to-fly>What is the safest time of day to fly?</h2>
<p>Studies have shown that early morning flights are less likely to be delayed than those in the afternoon and evening. To avoid delays, it’s best to leave before 8 a.m., according to data compiled by FiveThirtyEight.</p>
<h2 id=is-flying-at-night-more-dangerous>Is flying at night more dangerous?</h2>
<p>Accident statistics suggest that flying by night accounts for about 10% of the general aviation accidents, but 30% of the fatalities. That suggests night flying must be inherently more dangerous than aviating when the sun is up.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-least-expensive-day-to-buy-airline-tickets>What is the least expensive day to buy airline tickets?</h2>
<p>According to the CheapAir study, the cheapest days to fly are Tuesday and Wednesday, when you’ll save an average of $73 per ticket. Sunday is the most expensive. The Expedia/ARC study found that the cheapest day to travel domestically depends on the airport, but internationally, Thursday and Friday are best.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safer-to-fly-at-night-or-in-the-day>Is it safer to fly at night or in the day?</h2>
<p>Flight during the day is marginally safer due to the usually better visual conditions of daylight. Night conditions introduce a greater possibility of disorientation with the lack of visual cues but this is a very small factor given the competency of commercial pilots.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-worst-time-of-the-year-to-fly>When is the worst time of the year to fly?</h2>
<p>The best times to fly are the days with less demand for the seats, so that means the worst times of the year to fly are the times with the most demand. These generally include the days around holidays or festivals (in the U.S. or at the destination), sporting events, and any time kids are out of school.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-safest-year-for-air-travel>Which is the safest year for air travel?</h2>
<p>2017 was the safest year on record for commercial air travel, both by the number of fatal accidents and in terms of fatalities, despite more flights than ever before.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-day-of-the-week-to-fly>Which is the best day of the week to fly?</h2>
<p>Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are the best days to fly domestically Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday are the days with the highest cost and lowest number of award seats. There are two reasons for this, and both of them are relatively simple: business travel and vacations.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-fly-in-the-usa>Is it safe to fly in the USA?</h2>
<p>“US flying has become so safe that fear of an air journey is almost as far-fetched as fear of a ceiling collapse at the grocery store,” he wrote in an article for CNN. And even if you are unlucky enough to be involved in an air accident, you are likely to survive it.</p>
