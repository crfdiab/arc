<h2 id=are-pearls-cheaper-in-hawaii>Are pearls cheaper in Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Both places are a lot cheaper than any you’ll find in Hawaii or the mainland U.S., and certainly cheaper than pricey retail outlets like Maui Divers. For a strand of black pearls or a bracelet, we’re talking about several thousands of dollars difference.</p>

<h2 id=is-maui-divers-jewelry-real>Is Maui Divers Jewelry real?</h2>
<p>Maui Divers jewelry is a very reputable company. I have recieved a necklace and earrings from them. Gorgeous and worth every penny INSIDE their shop in Lahaina.</p>

<p>Pearl prices can range from less than $1 to $100,000s- depending on the type, size, quality, luster, color and shape.</p>

<h2 id=what-can-you-not-bring-back-from-hawaii>What can you not bring back from Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Items from Hawaii that travelers may NOT bring to the U.S. mainland:</p>

<h2 id=where-does-na-hoku-get-their-jewelry-from>Where does Na Hoku get their jewelry from?</h2>
<p>Na Hoku is retail chain based in Hawaii. The name is Hawaiian for “stars” and they do play up the Hawaiian theme on their site and marketing. The company has roots going back almost 100 years. Their jewelry is all made by Hawaiian designers and manufacturers.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-use-my-na-hoku-gift-certificate>Where can I use my Na Hoku gift certificate?</h2>
<p>Na Hoku Gift Certificates are redeemable in our stores and by calling Na Hoku Customer Service. You can use your Na Hoku Gift Certificate towards an item you have seen on our website. We ask that you contact our Customer Service team to redeem your Na Hoku Gift Certificate.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-na-hoku-diamond-so-bad>Why is the Na Hoku diamond so bad?</h2>
<p>The diamond is incredibly deep which saps the brilliance of the diamond and makes it look smaller. This is where the Na Hoku train really goes off the rails. Even ignoring the fact that they use a less than stellar certificate, the price for the quality is truly horrific.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-na-hoku-first-come-to-hawaii>When did Na Hoku first come to Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Na Hoku has called Hawaii our home since our beginning in 1924. We are blessed to be a part of these beautiful islands, and want to preserve their beauty to be enjoyed by families, friends, and our visitors for generations to come.
