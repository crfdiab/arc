<h2 id=which-statement-best-describes-the-distribution-of-human-populations-on-the-earth>Which statement best describes the distribution of human populations on the earth?</h2>
<p>Population is evenly distributed. The Answer is Most people live on a relatively small share of the earth’s surface.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-distribution-in-human-geography>What is distribution in human geography?</h2>
<p>Distribution refers to the way something is spread out or arranged over a geographic area. 5 – 12+</p>
<h2 id=is-the-human-population-is-distributed-unevenly-over-the-earths-surface>Is the human population is distributed unevenly over the earth’s surface?</h2>
<p>Complete Answer:Only 30%of earth’s surface is covered with land and the population is unevenly distributed over this area. Geographical, cultural, economical and social factors influence spatial distribution of population.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-population-distribution-related-to-the-earths-physical-geography>How is population distribution related to the earth’s physical geography?</h2>
<p>Population distribution means the pattern of where people live. World population distribution is uneven. Places which are sparsely populated contain few people. Places which are densely populated contain many people.</p>
<h2 id=which-statement-best-describes-the-distribution-of-earths-natural-resources>Which statement best describes the distribution of Earth’s natural resources?</h2>
<p>Answer Expert Verified Answer: D. Many types of resources are unevenly distributed across the world. Natural resources are those material or entity obtain from natural environment sources.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-best-describes-the-concept-of-population-density>Which of the following best describes the concept of population density?</h2>
<p>Number of individuals per unit area is called population density. The complete count of individuals in an area is called census. So, the correct answer is ‘Number of individuals per unit area’.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-types-of-population-distribution>What are the three types of population distribution?</h2>
<p>Individuals of a population can be distributed in one of three basic patterns: uniform, random, or clumped.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-types-of-distribution-in-geography>What are the 3 types of distribution in geography?</h2>
<p>Three basic types of population distribution within a regional range are (from top to bottom) uniform, random, and clumped.</p>
<h2 id=what-population-distribution-are-humans-most-commonly-found-in>What population distribution are humans most commonly found in?</h2>
<p>Clumped distribution<br>
Clumped distribution is the most common type of dispersion found in nature. In clumped distribution, the distance between neighboring individuals is minimized.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-factors-that-influence-the-distribution-of-population>What are the factors that influence the distribution of population?</h2>
<p>The main factors determining population distribution are : climate, landforms, topography, soil, energy and mineral resources, accessibility like distance from sea coast, natural harbours, navigable rivers or canals, cultural factors, political boundaries, controls on migration and trade, government policies, types of …</p>
<h2 id=which-statement-best-describes-the-distribution-of-water-on-earth>Which statement best describes the distribution of water on Earth?</h2>
<p>Which of the following best describes the distribution of water on Earth? Water is evenly distributed across Earth.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-description-of-population-distribution>Which is the best description of population distribution?</h2>
<p>Population distribution is the spread of people across the world, ie where people live. Population density is the number of people living in a particular area – usually 1 square kilometre – and can be written as total population/land area.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-definition-of-global-population-density>What is the definition of global population density?</h2>
<p>Global population density Population distribution is the spread of people across the world, ie where people live. Population density is the number of people living in a particular area – usually 1 square kilometre – and can be written as total population/land area.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-majority-of-the-worlds-population-live>Where does the majority of the world’s population live?</h2>
<p>The population of the world is now over 7 billion people, the vast majority of whom live in the developing world. The world’s population is spread unevenly across the globe with concentrations of large numbers of people living in the same area.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-know-the-definition-of-a-population>Do you know the definition of a population?</h2>
<p>A population is a group of people living in a geographical area who share similar cultures. It is not uncommon for there to be a census designed to know the total number of people in an area.</p>
