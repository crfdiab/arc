<h2 id=what-did-ashoka-do-for-the-mauryan-empire>What did Ashoka do for the Mauryan Empire?</h2>
<p>In addition to his edicts, Ashoka built stupas, monasteries, and other religious structures at noteworthy Buddhist sites, such as Sarnath. He was not an unworldly ruler, however. He efficiently managed a centralized government from the Mauryan capital at Pataliputra.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-mauryan-empire-decline>Why did Mauryan empire decline?</h2>
<p>The decline of the Maurya Dynasty was rather rapid after the death of Ashoka/Asoka. One obvious reason for it was the succession of weak kings. Another immediate cause was the partition of the Empire into two. Mauryan Empire began to decline after the death of Ashoka in 232 BC.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-ashoka-maurya-gain-power-in-india>How did Ashoka Maurya gain power in India?</h2>
<p>In 269 B.C.E. Ashoka Maurya inherited the throne of the Mauryan Empire in India. His family created an empire by conquering other kingdoms in brutal wars. When Ashoka became the king he continued to fight wars and expand the empire.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-empire-of-ashoka-located-in-india>Where was the Empire of Ashoka located in India?</h2>
<p>Considered by many to be one of India’s greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta’s empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east. It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-emperor-ashoka-in-buddhism>What was the role of Emperor Ashoka in Buddhism?</h2>
<p>One of the more enduring legacies of Ashoka was the model that he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and the state. Emperor Ashoka was seen as a role model to leaders within the Buddhist community. He not only provided guidance and strength, but he also created personal relationships with his supporters.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-philosophy-of-ashoka-and-chandragupta>What was the philosophy of Ashoka and Chandragupta?</h2>
<p>Ashoka and the Mauryan Empire. Later in his life, Chandragupta Maurya sought enlightenment by becoming a Jain. Jainism is an ancient Indian philosophy that combines elements of Hinduism and Buddhism. Jainism and Buddhism were popular with Indians who—like Chandragupta—had no status in the caste system.</p>
