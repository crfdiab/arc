<h2 id=who-was-the-first-jesuit-missionary-to-china>Who was the first Jesuit missionary to China?</h2>
<p>St. Francis Xavier<br>
The first attempt by the Jesuits to reach China was made in 1552 by St. Francis Xavier, Navarrese priest and missionary and founding member of the Society of Jesus. Xavier never reached the mainland, dying after only a year on the Chinese island of Shangchuan.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-matteo-ricci-get-to-china>How did Matteo Ricci get to China?</h2>
<p>Matteo Ricci S.J. Ricci arrived at the Portuguese settlement of Macau in 1582 where he began his missionary work in China. He became the first European to enter the Forbidden City of Beijing in 1601 when invited by the Wanli Emperor, who sought his services in matters such as court astronomy and calendrical science.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-jesuits-in-china>What happened to the Jesuits in China?</h2>
<p>Between the eighteenth century and mid-nineteenth century, nearly all Western missionaries in China were forced to conduct their teaching and other activities covertly. Many Jesuit priests, both Western-born and Chinese, are buried in the cemetery located in what is now the School of the Beijing Municipal Committee.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-matteo-ricci-known-for>What was Matteo Ricci known for?</h2>
<p>Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) was an Italian Jesuit missionary who opened China to evangelization. He was the best-known Jesuit and European in China prior to the 20th century. In 1571 he entered the Society of Jesus.</p>
<h2 id=what-impressed-matteo-ricci-about-china>What impressed Matteo Ricci about China?</h2>
<p>First and foremost, Matteo Ricci came to China as a missionary with his holy mission to save the fate of pagans, and with a religious superiority complex. All the educated Chinese seemed to believe that all three religions had been integrated and people could embrace them together.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-admiral-of-the-impressive-chinese-fleet>Who was the admiral of the impressive Chinese fleet?</h2>
<p>Zheng He<br>

<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-jesuit-and-a-catholic>What’s the difference between a Jesuit and a Catholic?</h2>
<p>A Jesuit is a member of the Society of Jesus, a Roman Catholic order which includes priests and brothers — men in a religious order who aren’t priests. St. Ignatius Loyola founded the order around 500 years ago, according to the Jesuits’ website.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-be-a-female-jesuit>Can you be a female Jesuit?</h2>
<p>Today, however, women participate in Jesuit education not only as students and teachers but increas- ingly in designated positions of leadership.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-jesuit-missionary-in-china>Who was the first Jesuit missionary in China?</h2>
<p>Matteo Ricci. Matteo Ricci was an Italian Jesuit missionary who introduced Christian teaching to the Chinese empire in the 16th century. Empowered by the example and teachings of St. Francis Xavier and Alessandro Valignano (who had mentored him in India), Ricci spent years adopting the language and culture of the country.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-jesuits-start-working-in-china>When did the Jesuits start working in China?</h2>
<p>As early as 1546, two Chinese boys enrolled in the Jesuits’ St. Paul’s College in Goa, the capital of Portuguese India. One of these two Christian Chinese, known as Antonio, accompanied St. Francis Xavier, a co-founder of the Society of Jesus, when he decided to start missionary work in China.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-society-of-jesus-get-involved-in-china>How did the Society of Jesus get involved in China?</h2>
<p>Fairly soon after the establishment of the direct European maritime contact with China (1513) and the creation of the Society of Jesus (1540), at least some Chinese became involved with the Jesuit effort. As early as 1546, two Chinese boys enrolled in the Jesuits’ St. Paul’s College in Goa, the capital of Portuguese India.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-jesuit-priests-buried-in-beijing>Who are the Jesuit priests buried in Beijing?</h2>
