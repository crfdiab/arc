<h2 id=what-percent-of-diamonds-come-from-russia>What percent of diamonds come from Russia?</h2>
<p>(Image courtesy of Wenco.) Diamonds reserves in Russia, Congo and Botswana combined account for at least 80.6% of the world’s total, estimated at about 1.1 billion million carats, a report released on Wednesday shows.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-is-rich-in-diamonds>Which country is rich in diamonds?</h2>
<p>Russia and the Botswana hold the world’s largest diamond reserves, totaling 650 million carats and 310 million carats, respectively, as of 2020. Based on production volume, Russia and Australia are the world’s largest producers.</p>
<h2 id=are-man-made-diamonds-worth-it>Are man made diamonds worth it?</h2>
<p>Many traditional jewelers tell customers that lab created diamonds have absolutely no value, but this could not be further from the truth. Most earth mined diamonds have resale value, and most lab created diamonds will have a similar resale value as well.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-worlds-largest-diamond-reserve>How big is the world’s largest diamond reserve?</h2>
<p>Reserves: 71.8 million carats. Diamond-bearing gravels were discovered in the area of the Venetia mine as early as 1903. In 1969, De Beers embarked on a project to find the source of these diamonds, and discovered the Venetia kimberlite in 1980. Construction began in 1990, and the mine was in full production by 1993.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-diamond-mining-country-in-the-world>Which is the largest diamond mining country in the world?</h2>
<p>In 2014, Russian miners extracted an estimated 38-39 million carats of diamonds. The main miner is ALROSA, which has a near monopoly on diamond mining in the country, accounting for well over 90% of the country’s annual production. Mines: ALROSA mined 36.2 million carats of diamonds in 2014.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-most-diamonds-found-in-africa>Where are the most diamonds found in Africa?</h2>
<p>Angola is rich in subsoil heritage where its diamond reserves are found. This African country gets most of its revenues in diamond and oil production which generates 60% of Angola’s income. It may seem surprising to many but Canada stands in 6th place, breaking the streak of the African countries.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-seventh-largest-diamond-in-the-world>Which is the seventh largest diamond in the world?</h2>
<p>Lesotho 910 carat diamond (to check) Lesotho 910 carat diamond is the seventh-largest gem-quality diamond in the world. It was discovered in Lesotho’s (a small landlocked country in Africa) Letseng diamond mine in 2018. The Letseng diamond mine is known for producing some of the world’s most expensive stones.</p>
