<h2 id=how-did-the-westward-expansion-effect-politics>How did the westward expansion effect politics?</h2>
<p>Westward expansion, particularly west of the Mississippi River, had profound effects on American politics. This expansion created a number of political crises that revolved around the expansion of slavery, dispossession of Native Americans and federal landholdings in the West.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-pioneers-want-to-expand-west>Why did the pioneers want to expand West?</h2>
<p>Pioneer settlers were sometimes pushed west because they couldn’t find good jobs that paid enough. Others had trouble finding land to farm. Pioneer settlers were sometimes pulled west because they wanted to make a better living. Others received letters from friends or family members who had moved west.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-westward-expand>How did westward expand?</h2>
<p>Westward expansion began in earnest in 1803. Thomas Jefferson negotiated a treaty with France in which the United States paid France $15 million for the Louisiana Territory – 828,000 square miles of land west of the Mississippi River – effectively doubling the size of the young nation.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-united-states-expand-to-the-west>Why did the United States expand to the west?</h2>
<p>Rooted in the idea of manifest destiny, the United States militantly expanded westward across the continent in the 19th century. Americans saw their nation’s mission as one of bringing education, modern technology, and civilization to the West and driving away the “uncivilized” American Indians.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-columbia-in-the-westward-expansion>What was the role of Columbia in the westward expansion?</h2>
<p>In John Gast’s American Progress (ca. 1872), the figure of Columbia, representing the United States and the spirit of democracy, makes her way westward, literally bringing light to the darkness as she advances. In the mid-19th century, the quest for control of the West led to the annexation of Texas and the Mexican–American War.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-during-the-time-of-the-westward-expansion>Who was president during the time of the westward expansion?</h2>
<p>In the mid-19th century, the quest for control of the West led to the annexation of Texas and the Mexican–American War. President James Polk’s administration (1845–1849) was a period of intensive expansion for the United States.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-daniel-boone-contribute-to-the-westward-expansion>How did Daniel Boone contribute to the westward expansion?</h2>
<p>The Push Westward The idea of expanding into the West had always been attractive, since settlers including Daniel Boone moved inland, across the Appalachians, in the 1700s. Boone had been instrumental in the establishment of what became known as the Wilderness Road, which led through the Cumberland Gap into the lands of Kentucky.</p>
