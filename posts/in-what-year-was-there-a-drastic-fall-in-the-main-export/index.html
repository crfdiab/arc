<h2 id=in-what-year-was-there-a-drastic-fall-in-the-main-export>In what year was there a drastic fall in the main export?</h2>
<p>WTO sees 9% global trade decline in 2009 as recession strikes. The collapse in global demand brought on by the biggest economic downturn in decades will drive exports down by roughly 9% in volume terms in 2009, the biggest such contraction since the Second World War, WTO economists forecast today (25 March 2009).</p>
<h2 id=how-much-has-global-trade-dropped-2020>How much has global trade dropped 2020?</h2>
<p>In 2020, global merchandise trade fell by 8% in current US dollar terms. The impact of the pandemic on international merchandise trade was, however, very heterogeneous across economies and products. The automotive sector was hard hit, weighing in particular on exports from North America and Europe.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-trade-decrease-in-2009>Why did trade decrease in 2009?</h2>
<p>Trade fell mostly because demand crashed globally and did so particularly in its most import-intensive component – investment.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-decline-in-trade-during-the-200809-financial-crisis>What caused the decline in trade during the 2008/09 financial crisis?</h2>
<p>According to the emerging consensus, the collapse was caused by the sudden, severe and globally synchronised postponement of purchases, especially of durable consumer and investment goods (and their parts and components).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-world-trade-plummet-during-the-great-depression>Why did world trade plummet during the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>Personal income, tax revenue, profits, and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25% and in some countries as high as 33%. Cities all around the world were hit hard, especially those dependent on heavy industry.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-bad-for-a-country-to-have-large-trade-deficits>Why is it bad for a country to have large trade deficits?</h2>
<p>Trade deficits are the difference between how much a country imports and how much it exports. When done right, they can let trading partners specialize in their strengths and create wealth for all consumers. Gone wrong, they can harm labor markets and create problems of savings and investment.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-top-10-trends-in-international-trade>What are the top 10 trends in international trade?</h2>
<p>10 global trade trends we’ll be watching in 2021</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual trade missions (VTMs)</li>
<li>Increased cross-industry collaboration.</li>
<li>Localization.</li>
<li>Agility.</li>
<li>Market diversification.</li>
<li>Supply chain as a service (SCaaS)</li>
<li>Supply chain risk mitigation.</li>
<li>Elastic logistics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-fall-of-2008>What caused the fall of 2008?</h2>
<p>This was caused by rising energy prices on global markets, leading to an increase in the rate of global inflation. “This development squeezed borrowers, many of whom struggled to repay mortgages. Property prices now started to fall, leading to a collapse in the values of the assets held by many financial institutions.</p>
<h2 id=what-brought-an-end-to-the-great-depression>What brought an end to the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>Mobilizing the economy for world war finally cured the depression. Millions of men and women joined the armed forces, and even larger numbers went to work in well-paying defense jobs. World War Two affected the world and the United States profoundly; it continues to influence us even today.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-world-trade-collapse-take-place>When did the World Trade Collapse take place?</h2>
<p>Richard Baldwin 27 November 2009. World trade experienced a sudden, severe, and synchronised collapse in late 2008 – the sharpest in recorded history and deepest since WWII. This ebook – written for the world’s trade ministers gathering for the WTO’s Trade Ministerial in Geneva – presents the economics profession’s received wisdom on the collapse.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-decline-in-world-trade-in-2020>What was the decline in World Trade in 2020?</h2>
<p>Merchandise trade in nominal dollar terms fell in 2020 by 8% while commercial services exports declined by 20%. Falling oil prices led to a 35% contraction in trade in fuels in 2020. Travel services were down 63% in 2020 and are not expected to fully recover until the pandemic wanes.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-great-trade-collapse-worse-than-the-great-depression>Is the great trade collapse worse than the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>Today collapse is much worse; for two quarters in a row, world trade flows have been 15% below their previous year levels. The OECD has monthly data on its members’ real trade for the past 533 months; the 7 biggest month-on-month drops among the 533 all occurred since November 2008 (see the chapter by Sónia Araújo and Joaquim Oliveira).</p>
<h2 id=is-the-world-trade-organization-predicting-a-decline>Is the World Trade Organization predicting a decline?</h2>
<p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) is predicting a severe decline in international commerce this year. In a new report the WTO forecasts a contraction of between 13% and 32% this year. The wide range of possibilities reflects the uncertainties about the health crisis.</p>
