<h2 id=are-there-any-states-that-do-not-share-a-border-with-another-state>Are there any states that do not share a border with another state?</h2>
<p>Two of the states do not share borders with any other state; one is an island and the other borders Canada. However, two states in the country share borders with eight other states! This fact is a record in the US as no other state shares so many borders. The two are Tennessee and Missouri; they even share borders with each other.</p>
