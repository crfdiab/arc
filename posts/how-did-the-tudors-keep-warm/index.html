<p>A Poor Tudor house would have a hole in the wall for a window; sometimes they would have wooden shutters to keep them warm. They had to sleep on straw beds or a mattress filled with straw and had small blankets to keep them warm.</p>

<p>A poor family’s house was usually one small room with a hole in the wall for a window (which might have a closing wooden shutter). They slept on straw or straw-filled mattresses with only a blanket to keep themselves warm.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-tudors-build-their-houses>How did the Tudors build their houses?</h2>
<p>Most houses had the wooden frame, as well as a tall chimney, steep roof and an enclosed fireplace inside. The walls between the timber frame were made from wattle and daub – wood strips or sticks covered with clay – and the outer walls were most often whitewashed. Many Tudor houses had thatched roofs.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-tudors-have-glass-windows>Did the Tudors have glass windows?</h2>
<p>The use of glass became more widespread during the Tudor period. It was during the Tudor times that glass was first used in homes. It was very expensive and difficult to make big pieces of glass so the panes were tiny and held together with lead in a criss-cross pattern, or ‘lattice’.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-a-tudor-house>What was life like in a Tudor house?</h2>
<p>Even in an upper class home children and servants sat on stools. Chimneys were also a luxury in Tudor times, although they became more common. In wealthy Tudor houses the walls of rooms were lined with oak panelling to keep out drafts. People slept in four-poster beds hung with curtains to reduce drafts.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-rich-people-do-in-the-tudor-times>What did the rich people do in the Tudor times?</h2>
<p>Other wealthy people hung tapestries or painted cloths on their walls. In Tudor England carpets were a luxury only the richest people could afford. They were too expensive to put on the floor! Instead they were hung on the wall or over tables. People covered the floors with rushes, reeds or straw, which they sprinkled with sweet smelling herbs.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-great-hall-in-a-tudor-house-made>How was the Great Hall in a Tudor house made?</h2>
<p>Second, the house’s chimney was installed, which for the time was revolutionary. Before Tudor architecture became standard in the 16th Century, buildings tended to be heated using the ‘great hall’ design, where a single large room would house an open fire and disperse smoke through holes in the upper walls and roofing.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-tudor-houses-have-so-many-windows>Why did the Tudor houses have so many windows?</h2>
<p>‘Look at me, I must be rich because my house has lots of glass’. Windows became the main features on many Tudor houses belonging to wealthy people. Hardwick Hall, the great Elizabethan mansion in Derbyshire with huge windows on all sides, was laughed at the time for being ‘more glass than walls’.</p>
