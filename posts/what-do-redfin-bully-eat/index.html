<h2 id=what-do-redfin-bully-eat>What do Redfin bully eat?</h2>
<p>Eats aquatic invertebrates. Some indigenous fish species are widespread but in low numbers and declining, e.g. longfin eel, giant kokopu, koaro and inanga.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-bully-fish-live>Where do bully fish live?</h2>
<p>They are found in a range of habitats including streams, rivers and lakes. Bullies are well camouflaged against sand and rocks, but can be seen darting in the shallows during the day.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-common-bully-eat>What does common bully eat?</h2>
<p>They generally prefer moderate to slow moving water which means they are the most likely bully species to be sighted. Its diet consists mainly of small benthic invertebrates but also involves insect larvae and crustacea.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-redfin-bullies-live>Where do Redfin bullies live?</h2>
<p>Redfin bullies are one of the many native diadromous species found in New Zealand. This means that they require access to both freshwater and the marine environment at some stage of their lives. They can be found in stony streams, much like those occupied by the other 6 native bully species.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-eels-eat>Where do eels eat?</h2>
<p>Eels eat “live” food. Small longfin eels living amongst the river gravels will feed on insect larvae, worms and water snails. When they get bigger, they begin to feed on fish. They will also eat fresh-water crayfish and even small birds like ducklings.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-diadromous-fish>What is Diadromous fish?</h2>
<p>Diadromous Fishes Diadromous is a general category describing fish that spend portions of their life cycles partially in fresh water and partially in salt water. These represent both anadromous and catadromous fish. Anadromous fishes spend most of their adult lives at sea, but return to fresh water to spawn.</p>
<h2 id=why-you-should-never-eat-eel>Why you should never eat eel?</h2>
<p>Eels’ blood is poisonous, which discourages other creatures from eating them. A very small amount of eel blood is enough to kill a person, so raw eel should never be eaten. Their blood contains a toxic protein that cramps muscles, including the most important one, the heart.</p>
<h2 id=is-eel-healthy-to-eat>Is eel healthy to eat?</h2>
<p>For the carb-conscious, eel contains no sugar, and is low in sodium and high in phosphorus. It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and protein which is great in terms of protecting our heart and maintaining healthy bones, improve blood pressure, lower cholesterol and reduce the risks of diabetes and arthritis.</p>
<h2 id=do-fish-get-sad-when-other-fish-die>Do fish get sad when other fish die?</h2>
<p>No, fish do not get “sad” if another fish dies. Fish do have a brain that is capable of some type of “emotion” but not to the extent that humans feel. They don’t feel anything like sadness, but may feel something to a smaller extent. Scientists have been able to train fish.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-know-if-my-fish-are-fighting-or-mating>How do I know if my fish are fighting or mating?</h2>
<p>Energetic Mating Behavior If the female Oscar plays hard to get, the suitor will become more physical with rubbing behavior that may look like fighting when it isn’t. Oscar couples always get along even when they’re not mating, so if you spot aggressive behavior and chasing, you’ll know they’re actually mating.</p>
<h2 id=are-most-fish-diadromous>Are most fish Diadromous?</h2>
<p>Diadromous Fishes Anadromous fishes spend most of their adult lives at sea, but return to fresh water to spawn. Catadromous is a term used for a special category of marine fishes who spend most of their adult lives in fresh water, but must return to the sea to spawn.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-find-bullies-in-new-zealand>Where can you find bullies in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>They are found in a range of freshwater habitats. There are seven species of bullies in New Zealand. They are found in a range of habitats including streams, rivers and lakes. Bullies are well camouflaged against sand and rocks, but can be seen darting in the shallows during the day.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fish-is-a-redfin-bully>What kind of fish is a redfin bully?</h2>
<p>The bright red fins of an adult male redfin have to make this one of New Zealand’s most attractive freshwater fish. Although only males get this distinct colouration, the diagonal stripes on the cheeks make the redfin bully easy to identify. These stripes are even visible in small bullies from about 30 mm in length.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-bullies-go-when-they-go-to-sea>Where do bullies go when they go to sea?</h2>
<p>Even though they are well camouflaged against sand and rocks, common bully are often seen darting in the shallows during the day. The male guards the nest and when the eggs hatch, the larvae go to sea to return to freshwater after a few months.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-water-does-common-bully-fish-live-in>What kind of water does common bully fish live in?</h2>
<p>This fish prefers swiftly flowing gravelly streams, just like the torrentfish. Even though they are well camouflaged against sand and rocks, common bully are often seen darting in the shallows during the day. The male guards the nest and when the eggs hatch, the larvae go to sea to return to freshwater after a few months.</p>
