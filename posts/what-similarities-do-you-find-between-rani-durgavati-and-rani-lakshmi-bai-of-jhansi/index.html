<p>June 18 1858: Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi Dies While Fighting the British Troops near Gwalior. Lakshmibai, the Rani of the princely state of Jhansi, was a brave and fearless woman who fought courageously against the British and eventually lost her life in battle on June 18th 1858 in Gwalior.</p>

<p>Ans. When Dulaji Thakur said that the captive was not Rani Lakshmibai, the British commander was furious that they had been tricked. He realized that if Jhalakari was allowed to go free, she would be dangerous, so he sentenced her to death by hanging.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, unrest began to spread throughout India and in May of 1857, the First War of Indian Independence erupted in numerous pockets across the northern subcontinent.
