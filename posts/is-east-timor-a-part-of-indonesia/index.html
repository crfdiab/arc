<h2 id=is-east-timor-a-part-of-indonesia>Is East Timor a part of Indonesia?</h2>
<p>East Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975, but was invaded by neighbouring Indonesia nine days later. The country was later incorporated as a province of Indonesia.</p>
<h2 id=is-east-timor-part-of-asean>Is East Timor part of Asean?</h2>
<p>In 2002, East Timor was recognised as an observer of ASEAN and joined the ASEAN Regional Forum in 2005. East Timor officially applied for membership in ASEAN on 4 March 2011. After elections in 2012, the new government reaffirmed their commitment to joining the association.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-is-being-considered-to-be-the-next-member-of-asean>Which country is being considered to be the next member of ASEAN?</h2>
<p>This process began with ASEAN’s five original members, who founded the association through the signing of Bangkok Declaration in 1967. Since then, the ASEAN’s membership has grown to ten with the accession of Cambodia in 1999. Currently, two states are seeking accession to ASEAN: Papua New Guinea and East Timor.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-indonesia-invade-west-papua>Why did Indonesia invade West Papua?</h2>
<p>The Indonesian government wanted all of the former Dutch colonies in the Asia-Pacific region and the Indonesian military soon invaded West Papua. It was the height of the Cold War and the US government was worried that Indonesia seeking Soviet Union support might increase the spread of communism in South East Asia.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-animal-to-see-in-brunei>Which is the best animal to see in Brunei?</h2>
<p>Most hornbill watchers want to spot the surprisingly common rhinoceros hornbill, the largest of the species and a curious sight indeed. A great place to find the rhinoceros hornbill is along the Belait River, or much further inland in the Labi Forest. Be warned, however, that you’ll likely hear this bird before you see it.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-find-green-crested-lizard-in-brunei>Where can you find green crested lizard in Brunei?</h2>
<p>The color-changing green crested lizard can be found in your local gardens. From the lowland swamps to the mountain forests, birdwatchers can find the black and yellow broadbill – a remarkable bird that covers its nests with lichen and spider webs. The magical wonders of Borneo may seem difficult to find in Brunei, but they’re never far away.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-monkeys-are-found-in-brunei>What kind of monkeys are found in Brunei?</h2>
<p>PROBOSCIS MONKEY: One of Asia’s largest species of monkey, the proboscis monkey is perhaps the most sought after primate in the wilds of Brunei. Known for its oddly bulbous nose, this animal is easily a traveler favorite.</p>
