<h2 id=what-tactics-were-used-in-the-franco-prussian-war>What tactics were used in the Franco Prussian war?</h2>
<p>Prussian tactics were offensive: recognising the growing superiority of firepower, they made full use of what we would now recognised as decentralised Mission Command to control their forces, marching as corps with the aim of collapsing around the enemy position rather than attacking it directly.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-tactics-in-war>What are tactics in war?</h2>
<p>Tactics, in warfare, the art and science of fighting battles on land, on sea, and in the air. It is concerned with the approach to combat; the disposition of troops and other personalities; the use made of various arms, ships, or aircraft; and the execution of movements for attack or defense.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-the-prussians-able-to-deploy-troops-so-quickly>How were the Prussians able to deploy troops so quickly?</h2>
<p>Masterminding the movement of the armies was the forward-thinking Prussian Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke. He used railways and telegraph communication to deploy the troops as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>
<h2 id=what-tactics-were-used-in-ww2>What tactics were used in ww2?</h2>
<p>Germany quickly overran much of Europe and was victorious for more than two years by relying on a new military tactic called the “Blitzkrieg” (lightning war). Blitzkrieg tactics required the concentration of offensive weapons (such as tanks, planes, and artillery) along a narrow front.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-france-lose-the-franco-prussian-war>Why did France lose the Franco-Prussian War?</h2>
<p>Lasting from 19 July 1870 to 28 January 1871, the conflict was caused primarily by France’s determination to restore its dominant position in continental Europe, which it had lost following Prussia’s crushing victory over Austria in 1866.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id=what-did-the-prussians-do-during-the-war>What did the Prussians do during the war?</h2>
<p>As a result, troops were formed in tight lines, scouting patrols were rarely used, and chasing a defeated enemy army was extremely difficult. Marching, let alone attacking by night, or establishing camps close to forests had to be avoided. Soldiers were ordered to watch over their comrades for potential deserters, in times of peace as at war.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-divisions-did-the-prussian-army-have>How many divisions did the Prussian Army have?</h2>
<p>These corps were composed of divisions (usually two or more brigades), brigades, regiments and battalions, although the Prussian army used large brigades rather than divisions.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-prussian-army-exposed-for-its-inadequacies>When was the Prussian army exposed for its inadequacies?</h2>
<p>The inadequacies of the Prussian army had already been exposed in the period 1792–95 when, as part of the first coalition, it encountered the then pre-Napoleonic French revolutionary army of mostly untrained volunteers, and lost.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-prussian-general-staff>What was the purpose of the Prussian General Staff?</h2>
<p>For the main purpose of the general staff was preparing for war, mostly at the tactical level. This purpose was clear to the reformers who founded the general staff, but not necessarily to the broader Prussian military, especially the old guard of senior commanders.</p>
