<p>The popping (batting) crease is marked 1.22m in front of the stumps at either end, with the stumps set along the bowling crease. The return creases are marked at right angles to the popping and bowling creases and are measured 1.32m either side of the middle stumps.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-a-cricket-pitch-22-yards>Why is a cricket pitch 22 yards?</h2>
<p>In those days a chain was one of the few reliable forms of measurement – so designed because it was unlikely to stretch like rope. Therefore as a Chain = 22yards in the Imperial measure and cricket rules were written by the Brits. So, the length of the Cricket pitch is 22 yards.</p>

<h2 id=how-is-pitch-length-measured>How is pitch length measured?</h2>
<p>The pitch length is obtained by adding the pitch circumference of one sheave to twice the center distance between two equal diameter sheaves at a specified tension. [More recently changed to datum length.] The belt pitch length is normally the length at the belt pitch line.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-length-and-width-of-a-cricket-pitch>What is the length and width of a cricket pitch?</h2>
<p>The length of the Cricket Pitch is 22 yards (20.12 meters or 66 feet). This is the distance from wicket to wicket on either end of the Pitch. The width of a Cricket Pitch is 10 feet (3.05 meters). Pictorial representation of a cricket pitch with dimensions in cms (source)</p>

<p>As stated above, the pitch lies in the middle of the cricket field. The pitch is a rectangular area of the ground 22 yards (20.12 meters) m in length and 10 ft (3.05 m) in width. The creases are areas that are marked white with chalk. There are four creases drawn at the ends of the pitch.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-bails-are-used-on-a-cricket-pitch>How many bails are used on a cricket pitch?</h2>

<h2 id=how-are-the-markings-on-a-cricket-field-made>How are the markings on a cricket field made?</h2>
<p>For limited overs cricket matches, there are two additional field markings. A painted oval is made by drawing a semicircle of 30 yards (27.4 m) radius from the center of each wicket with respect to the breadth of the pitch and joining them with lines parallel, 30 yards (27.4 m) to the length of the pitch.</p>
