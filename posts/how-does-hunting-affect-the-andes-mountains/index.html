<h2 id=how-does-hunting-affect-the-andes-mountains>How does hunting affect the Andes Mountains?</h2>
<p>Hunting as a subsistence strategy, particularly the hunting of deer and camelids, was of prime importance in the development of early Andean culture ; first because hunting formed one of the principal means by which man took possession of and adapted to the ecologically vertical environment of the Andes, and secondly …</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-the-andes-mountains>What are the effects of the Andes Mountains?</h2>
<p>Because the Andes act as a large wall between the Pacific Ocean and the continent, they have a tremendous impact on climate in the region. The northern part of the Andes is typically rainy and warm, and the weather is also wet in the eastern part of central Andes, and the area to the southwest.</p>
<h2 id=what-endangered-animals-live-in-the-andes-mountains>What endangered animals live in the Andes Mountains?</h2>
<p>For Endangered Species Day, discover five threatened species and how you can help us protect them by supporting the Amazonian Andes appeal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Puyo Giant Glass Frog (Nymphargus puyoensis)</li>
<li>Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea)</li>
<li>Lowland Tapir (Tapirus terrestris)</li>
<li>Neotropical Otter (Lontra longicaudis)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-human-activity-is-contributing-to-the-biodiversity-loss-in-the-tropical-andes>What human activity is contributing to the biodiversity loss in the Tropical Andes?</h2>
<p>Although there are several other factors that threaten life and biodiversity in the Tropical Andes—including the introduction of invasive species, unsustainable agricultural practices, and illegal drug production—population growth, urbanization, and resource extraction are the three most critical threats to life in the …</p>
<h2 id=what-animal-is-native-to-the-andes-mountains>What animal is native to the Andes Mountains?</h2>
<p>A wild camelid species living in the Andean mountains, the Vicugna vicugna is Peru’s national animal. The animal is known for its wool which is produced in very small amounts but is of extremely fine quality.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-are-the-people-in-the-andes-mountains>How old are the people in the Andes Mountains?</h2>
<p>Join Britannica’s Publishing Partner Program and our community of experts to gain a global audience for your work! The people. Human presence in the Andes is relatively recent; the oldest human remains to be found are only 10,000 to 12,000 years old, although habitation probably dates to much earlier times.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-dangers-of-traveling-in-the-andes-mountains>What are the dangers of traveling in the Andes Mountains?</h2>
<p>Communicable Disease. Although Peru does not require international travelers to receive inoculations, people traveling to the Andes Mountains should receive immunizations to avoid contracting communicable diseases such as typhoid, tetanus, polio and hepatitis A. In addition, it is best to boil or treat water before drinking it to avoid diarrhea,…</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-rain-forest-in-the-andes-being-destroyed>Why is the rain forest in the Andes being destroyed?</h2>
<p>Sadly, the type of scenario described in the preceding paragraphs is not uncommon. The Tropical Andes, one of the world’s biodiversity epicenters, is experiencing just this type of deforestation everyday. Much of the deforestation is result of growing human populations and burgeoning cities.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-people-of-the-andes-adapted-to-high-altitude>How are people of the Andes adapted to high altitude?</h2>
<p>“It’s like comparing apples and pears,” agrees Bastien Llamas, a geneticist at The University of Adelaide in Australia. The only way to see which genetic differences are true high-altitude adaptations, they say, would be to compare ancient Andeans to ancient inhabitants of the nearby coasts of Peru or northern Chile.</p>
