<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-mughal-empire-after>What happened to the Mughal Empire after?</h2>
<p>The Mughal Empire began to decline in the 18th century, during the reign of Muḥammad Shah (1719–48). Much of its territory fell under the control of the Marathas and then the British. The last Mughal emperor, Bahādur Shah II (1837–57), was exiled by the British after his involvement with the Indian Mutiny of 1857–58.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-decline-of-the-mughal-empire>What was the result of the decline of the Mughal Empire?</h2>
<p>A series of foreign invasions affected Mughal Empire very badly. Attacks by Nadir Shah and Ahmad Shah Abdali, which were themselves the consequences of the weakness of the Empire, drained the Empire of its wealth, ruined its trade and industry in the North, and almost destroyed its military power.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-mughal-empire-came-to-a-state-of-disintegration>When did the Mughal Empire came to a state of disintegration?</h2>
<p>The disintegration of Mughal Empire made the soil fertile for the colonisation by the British. In 1857, Bahadur Shah II played an important symbolic role and with his death in 1862, the Mughal Empire came to an end.</p>
<h2 id=who-defeated-the-mughal-empire>Who defeated the Mughal Empire?</h2>
<p>Sher Shah Suri (1540-1545): was an Afghan leader who took over the Mughal Empire after defeating Humayun in 1540. Sher Shah occupied the throne of Delhi for not more than five years, but his reign proved to be a landmark in the Sub-continent.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-causes-of-decline-of-mughal-empire>What are the major causes of decline of Mughal Empire?</h2>
<p>Causes of the decline of the Mughal Empire:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weak Successors:</li>
<li>Degeneration of the Mughal Nobility:</li>
<li>Aurangzeb’s Religious persecution of the Hindus:</li>
<li>Demoralization of the Mughal Army:</li>
<li>Economic Bankruptcy:</li>
<li>Invasions:</li>
<li>Size of the Empire and Challenge from Regional Powers:</li>
<li>Aurangzeb’s Deccan Policy:</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-did-the-mughal-empire-decline-quizlet>Why did the Mughal Empire decline quizlet?</h2>
<p>The Mughal Empire was in serious decline by the end of the eighteenth century. What eventually pushed it into decline was the ambition of the British. England Had been the first country to experience the Industrial Revolution. Its industries were producing cheap manufactured goods which were sold around the world.</p>
<h2 id=did-mughals-make-india-rich>Did Mughals make India rich?</h2>
<p>In fact, most people in Mughal India were utterly, cripplingly poor even though of course a lot of wealth was concentrated in the hands of the monarchy and the nobility. No doubt the Mughals made SOME people rich but MANY others suffered terribly, and were persecuted mercilessly.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-mughal-empire-begin-to-disintegrate>When did the Mughal Empire begin to disintegrate?</h2>
<p>The death of Aurangzeb in 1707 A.D. marked the end of the glory of the Mughul empire. Of course, the process of disintegration of the Empire began during the reign of Aurangzeb, yet, the conditions were not so deplorable that the process could not be checked.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-law-of-succession-affect-the-mughal-empire>How did the law of succession affect the Mughal Empire?</h2>
<p>The Mughals did not follow any law of succession like the law of primogeniture. Consequently, each time a ruler died, a war of succession between the brothers for the throne started. This weakened the Mughal Empire, especially after Aurangzeb. The nobles, by siding with one contender or the other, increased their own power. 2. Aurangzeb’s Policies:</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-rulers-of-the-mughal-empire>Who are the rulers of the Mughal Empire?</h2>
<p>Mohammad Shah was succeeded by a number of inefficient rulers Ahmad Shah (1748-1754), Alamgir II (1754-1759), Shah Alam II (1759-1806), Akbar II (1806-1837) and Bahadur Shah II (1837-1857). During the rule of Alamgir II, the East India Company fought the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hussain-ali-of-the-mughal-empire-die>When did Hussain Ali of the Mughal Empire die?</h2>
<p>In 1720, Hussain Ali was killed by the rebellious nobles and Abdullah Khan died in 1722 after he was defeated at Agra. This ended the rule of the Sayyid brothers in the Mughal Empire. After the fall of the Sayyid brothers Muhammad Shah had a long reign (1719-48) to save the empire. The Mughal rule was still held in high esteem by the people.</p>
