<h2 id=what-type-of-interest-group-is-aba>What type of interest group is ABA?</h2>
<p>The American Bar Association was founded on August 21, 1878, by a group of 75 lawyers. The ABA is a voluntary bar association of lawyers and law students which is not specific to any jurisdiction in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-primary-goal-of-interest-groups-quizlet>What is the primary goal of interest groups quizlet?</h2>
<p>The fundamental goal of interest groups is to influence public policy. Interest groups do this by gathering a huge group of people that have a stand on a certain issue to get the attention from a national institution to fix or create a policy to go with their needs.</p>
<h2 id=what-exactly-is-an-interest-group>What exactly is an interest group?</h2>
<p>A special interest group (SIG) is a community within a larger organization with a shared interest in advancing a specific area of knowledge, learning or technology where members cooperate to affect or to produce solutions within their particular field, and may communicate, meet, and organize conferences.</p>

<h2 id=when-it-comes-to-interest-groups-how-is-wealth-generally-transferred-quizlet>When it comes to interest groups how is wealth generally transferred quizlet?</h2>
<p>When it comes to interest groups, how is wealth generally transferred? Voting and decision-making in many nonprofit organizations…</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-direct-way-for-interest-groups-to-influence-government>What is the most direct way for interest groups to influence government?</h2>
<p>The first main direct technique that an interest group might use is called lobbying. Lobbying is when a person, called a lobbyist, attempts to directly influence legislation by interacting with government officials.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-factor-in-the-influence-of-interest-groups-quizlet>Which is a factor in the influence of interest groups quizlet?</h2>
<p>Factors that can help make an interest group effective include membership size, financial resources, strong leadership, and cohesion around specific issues. The existence of interest groups has been seen as confirming both the elite theory and the pluralist theory of American politics.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-definition-of-a-public-interest-group>Which is the best definition of a public interest group?</h2>
<p>Public interest groups may be defined as those groups pursuing goals the achievement of which ostensibly will provide benefits to the public at large, or at least to a broader population than the group’s own membership.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-interest-groups-important-in-a-democracy>Why are interest groups important in a democracy?</h2>
<p>Interest groups can thwart useful reforms, and they can also pressure legislators into introducing legislation that imposes costs on others to satisfy their rent-seeking aspirations. In a democracy the size of an interest group is important, given the need of current legislators to secure re-election, and of would-be legislators to win votes.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-theory-of-interest-groups>Which is the best theory of interest groups?</h2>
<p>The first theory that we are going to discuss is the elitist theory. People who subscribe to this theory think that the more money you have, the more influence you have. Basically, it says that wealthier interest groups are able to exert more pressure on policy makers and therefore are more likely to influence public policy in their favor.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-pluralist-view-of-interest-groups-work>How does the pluralist view of interest groups work?</h2>
<p>Interest groups, therefore, have to compete against other groups to influence public policy. The pluralist view does not take into account that all interest groups are not created equal. Instead it assumes that each interest group has the same level of influence and that competition is a level playing field.</p>
