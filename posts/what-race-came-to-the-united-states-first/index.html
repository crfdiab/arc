<h2 id=what-race-came-to-the-united-states-first>What race came to the United States first?</h2>
<p>In Brief. For decades archaeologists thought the first Americans were the Clovis people, who were said to have reached the New World some 13,000 years ago from northern Asia. But fresh archaeological finds have established that humans reached the Americas thousands of years before that.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-native-americans-originate-from>Where did Native Americans originate from?</h2>
<p>The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago, possibly much earlier, from Asia via Beringia. A vast variety of peoples, societies and cultures subsequently developed.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-people-in-america>Who was the first people in America?</h2>
<p>The earliest populations in the Americas, before roughly 10,000 years ago, are known as Paleo-Indians.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-foreigners-to-america-come-from>Where did the first foreigners to America come from?</h2>
<p>Scientists generally agree that the first Americans crossed over from Asia via the Bering land bridge, which connected the two continents. This exodus most likely began between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago. But some researchers have argued that Alaskan glaciers would have blocked entry into North America.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-united-states-called-before-1776>What was the United States called before 1776?</h2>
<p>The United Colonies<br>
9, 1776. On Sept. 9, 1776, the Continental Congress formally changed the name of their new nation to the “United States of America,” rather than the “United Colonies,” which was in regular use at the time, according to History.com.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-america-become-america>How did America become America?</h2>
<p>On July 4, 1776, people from the 13 colonies agreed to the United States Declaration of Independence. This said that they were free and independent states, and were not part of England any more. America had won the war and its independence.</p>

<p>Cactus Hill may be one of the oldest archaeological sites in the Americas. If proven to have been inhabited 16,000 to 20,000 years ago, it would provide supporting evidence for pre-Clovis occupation of the Americas.</p>

<p>United States<br>
On September 9, 1776, the Continental Congress formally declares the name of the new nation to be the “United States” of America. This replaced the term “United Colonies,” which had been in general use.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-people-were-the-first-americans>What kind of people were the first Americans?</h2>
<p>There are several theories about these very first Americans, which we call Paleo-Americans or Paleo-Indians, and they can be quite different. Many rely on a basic assumption; the first Americans likely arrived in boats, rather than over land. They relied upon marine life as a dominant food source and were skilled seafarers.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-settle-in-the-americas>Who was the first person to settle in the Americas?</h2>
<p>The First Americans: Ancient DNA Rewrites Settlement Story. A genetic analysis of a baby’s remains dating back 11,500 years suggests that a previously unknown human population was among the first to settle in the Americas.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-oldest-ethnic-group-in-the-world>Which is the oldest ethnic group in the world?</h2>
<p>5 Ethnic Groups That Prove the First Humans Were Black. An October 2012 genetic study published in Science Magazine found that the Khoisan in southern Africa are the oldest ethnic group of modern humans, with their ancestral line originating about 100,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-people-on-earth-come-from>Where did the first people on Earth come from?</h2>
<p>The claim is based on an extensive analysis of African DNA in a study published in the journal Science. The San people live in southern Africa and are also known as bushmen. The San have been hunter-gatherers for thousands of years.</p>
