<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-walk-around-são-paulo>Is it safe to walk around São Paulo?</h2>
<p>São Paulo is not really a pedestrianised city, and walking anywhere at night can be dangerous. Whilst some parts of the city are safer to walk at night than others, this is generally not a walking city. If you find yourself downtown after dark, it is best to be in groups and walk only short distances.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-get-from-são-paulo-airport-to-the-city>How do I get from São Paulo airport to the city?</h2>
<p>From Guarulhos Airport to the city, travelers can either take a taxi or a bus. Prepaid taxi fares are available with Taxi Guarucoop (tel. 011/2440-7070; <a href=http://www.guarucoop.com.br>www.guarucoop.com.br</a>). Sample fares: Congonhas Airport R$92, São Paulo Centro and Tietê R$75, and Jardins and Avenida Paulista R$85.</p>

<p>Uber: Uber is a safe way to get to the city hassle-free. (Like using taxis, the trip will take between 10 and 50 minutes depending on traffic.) The cost is R$60 ($15 USD) for UberX to get to Ipanema and R$100 ($25 USD) for Uber Black.</p>

<h2 id=how-do-you-dress-like-a-local-in-brazil>How do you dress like a local in Brazil?</h2>
<p>dress with a casual feel, think jeans, shorts and t-shirts or tunics. Rio de Janeiro is also very casual, but with a cool edge, a lot of the locals go from the beach to lunch or for drinks, so carry a light dress or shorts and a loose tee to cover up, as bikinis are for the beach only.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-travel-to-brazil>What’s the best way to travel to Brazil?</h2>
<p>Take a solo day trip, or a week-long group excursion. One of the great things about Brazil attractions is that you’ll easily be able to find something that’s compatible with your pace and budget.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-say-when-you-meet-someone-in-brazil>What do you say when you meet someone in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Literally translating to ‘Everything well?’, it is the most common way to ask ‘how are you?’ and usually follows after ‘oi’. So when you meet someone, try greeting them with ‘oi, tudo bem?’. The most common reply, independent on how you really are feeling, is ‘tudo bem’.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-get-a-tourist-visa-for-brazil>How to get a tourist visa for Brazil?</h2>
<p>A visa is a document that shows you have permission from a country to visit or work there. Make sure you start the application process well before your trip, as it may take some time to receive your visa. Determine if you need a visa. Brazil requires that visitors from many other countries obtain a visa before they visit.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-people-in-brazil-mean-when-they-say-hi>What do people in Brazil mean when they say hi?</h2>
<p>If you have your dream holiday to Brazil coming up, it’s handy to arrive armed with the following essential phrases. Brazilians love it when tourists try speaking Portuguese, so have a go and make some new friends in the process. ‘Oi’ literally just means ‘hi’ in Portuguese, and has no similarity to the dismissive and rude ‘oi’ in English.</p>
