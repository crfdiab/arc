<h2 id=can-ou-freshman-live-off-campus>Can OU freshman live off campus?</h2>
<p>While most schools require on-campus living for non-local students, there are plenty of non-commuter schools that allow freshmen to live outside the confines of campus.

<h2 id=does-ou-allow-pets-in-dorms>Does OU allow pets in dorms?</h2>
<p>OU students are not to have any sort of pet, with the exception of fish tanks in their dorm. The policy stands as a regard to the concern over students’ health and allergy conditions. With the exception of service animals, dogs, cats and other animals are not permitted in university buildings as well.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-go-to-college-outside-of-the-us>What’s the best way to go to college outside of the US?</h2>
<p>He suggests students talk to alumni or people that you know who have completed a degree internationally. Thats as important for an American student going to the London School of Economics or to the Sorbonne [in Paris] as it is at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, he says.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-miles-from-your-university-do-you-live>How many miles from your University do you live?</h2>
<p>State university grads generally stay within state lines with an average distance of 330 miles from their alma mater, and 40% are within 50 miles of the university. Graduates of elite schools flock to the big cities and tend to move nearly 700 miles away from their universities.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-out-of-state-student-go-to-a-public-university>Can a out of State student go to a public university?</h2>
<p>Many students now attend public universities to reduce the cost of higher education. Unfortunately, students often face a huge premium if they want to attend a public university that is not in their state of residence. This can be very problematic if good public university options are limited within their own state.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-apply-for-housing-at-university-of-texas-at-arlington>How to apply for housing at University of Texas at Arlington?</h2>
<p>A: Apply for housing as soon as you think you may be interested in attending the University of Texas at Arlington. You don’t have to be accepted to the university to submit your housing application. You need only have applied and received your student ID number. On campus space fills up quickly so it’s important to get your application in early.</p>
