<h2 id=how-early-can-you-buy-alcohol-in-washington>How early can you buy alcohol in Washington?</h2>
<p>The law allows liquor to be sold, served, and consumed between 6 am and 2 am, seven days a week. After 2 am no one may possess, consume or be served alcohol at a licensed premises. Alcohol can not leave the premises.</p>

<p>Under Washington’s new law, stores will be open for five hours on Sundays, from noon to 5 p.m. When the idea to allow Sunday sales in Washington surfaced three years ago, the proposal would have forced all state stores to open on Sundays.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-buy-liquor-in-grocery-stores-in-washington>Can you buy liquor in grocery stores in Washington?</h2>
<p>Beginning June 1, grocery stores in Washington will begin selling liquor. Beginning next June, liquor sales will shift from the state to grocery and warehouse stores, including Costco. It means more than 900 state employees will lose their jobs, most of them workers at state-run liquor stores.</p>
<h2 id=what-time-can-you-not-buy-alcohol-in-washington-state>What time can you not buy alcohol in Washington state?</h2>
<p>Licensed businesses may sell alcohol between 6 a.m. and to 2 a.m. Local jurisdictions may reduce those hours of sale. It’s illegal to sell alcohol to anyone, including adults, under 21. It’s also a violation of Washington alcohol laws to serve an intoxicated person.</p>
<h2 id=does-costco-sell-liquor-in-washington-state>Does Costco sell liquor in Washington state?</h2>
<p>Everything alcohol is sold at Costco in Washington State. Beer, wine, spirits and they have some of the Kirkland lines of alcohol.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-can-you-buy-alcohol-in-washington-state>How often can you buy alcohol in Washington State?</h2>
<p>Local ordinances prevail, but typically the stores are open 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Package stores can open on Sunday if local laws permit. Beer and wine can be purchased in grocery stores and convenience marts seven days a week. Alcohol is served in bars and restaurants from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. every day.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-states-allow-grocery-stores-to-sell-liquor>When did states allow grocery stores to sell liquor?</h2>
<p>After the end of prohibition in 1933, states were allowed to regulate alcohol sales themselves. But it resulted in a wide variety of laws from state to state. So many have wondered what states allow grocery stores to sell liquor? But there’s a lot more to know than that! Many states allow you to buy beer in grocery stores.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-liquor-stores-open-on-sunday>Are there any liquor stores open on Sunday?</h2>
<p>State-owned liquor stores are typically closed on Sunday and voting day. This handy map put together by Christopher Ingraham of the Washington Post shows a birds-eye view of state alcohol sales in supermarkets. Note: the states labeled “No Sales” allow the sale of beer with very low alcohol content.</p>

<p>Also, the U.S. is one of the few countries that makes you wait until you’re 21 to legally drink. Without a doubt, one of the most confusing and frustrating aspects of these long-standing alcohol restrictions is trying to figure out what kind of booze you can buy in a given state’s grocery stores.</p>
