<h2 id=what-should-you-do-if-you-drank-contaminated-water>What should you do if you drank contaminated water?</h2>
<p>Of course the most important advice is to go and see your doctor if you start to feel unwell. Early symptoms resemble a cold or flu, with a fever. Remember also that water contaminated with leptospires is likely to be contaminated with other harmful bacteria and chemicals.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-get-sick-from-water-in-mexico>Can you get sick from water in Mexico?</h2>
<p>The tap water in Mexico will most certainly be safe by local health and safety standards, but won’t necessarily agree with your stomach. As such it’s much better to just stick to bottled water, and it’s definitely important that you drink more water than you usually would.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-know-if-i-drank-contaminated-water>How do I know if I drank contaminated water?</h2>

<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-sick-after-drinking-contaminated-water>How long does it take to get sick after drinking contaminated water?</h2>
<p>Anyone who has been drinking from a contaminated source can experience vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pains and mild fever. Some may feel ill three to four days after eating or drinking from a contaminated source, but it’s not uncommon for a person to feel ill on day one or even day ten.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-get-sick-from-drinking-water-in-mexico>Can you get sick from drinking water in Mexico?</h2>
<p>If you are coming on vacation you may worry about getting sick from ice in your drink or drinking water in Mexico. So we are here to set it straight. Here is the truth about drinking water in Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-drink-filtered-water-in-mexico>Do you have to drink filtered water in Mexico?</h2>
<p>However, these days every single reputable restaurant and most of the not so reputable restaurants use filtered water to make ice cubes. Don’t worry about the ice in your drink when you’re visiting Mexico, it’s been made to ensure you don’t get sick.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-public-water-in-mexico>How much does it cost to get public water in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Public water is very cheap in Mexico and so is drinking water. Public water is about 120 pesos (or $6.70 USD) a month in Playa Del Carmen (this includes the delivery in the pipes to your home, and the water leaving your home and then cleaned). The large bottles of water are about 30 pesos each(or $2.00 USD).</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-buy-a-bottle-of-water-in-mexico>Where can I buy a bottle of water in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Otherwise, if you are just traveling for a short period of time, you can buy 1.5-liter, 1-liter and 500-ml bottles from convenience stores like Oxxo, 7-11, or local non-chain stores. A 500ml bottle costs about 5-10 Pesos, and you can get a 1.5-liter for between 10 and 20 Pesos.</p>
