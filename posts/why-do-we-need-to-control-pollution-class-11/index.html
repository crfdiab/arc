<h2 id=why-do-we-need-to-control-pollution-class-11>Why do we need to control pollution Class 11?</h2>
<p>Pollution has harmful effects both for human life and the life of other species. Need for pollution control: Important reasons which make a case for pollution control are: (i) reduction of health hazards, (ii) reduced risk of liability, (iii) cost savings (iv) improved public image, and (v) other social benefits.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-pollution-so-important>Why is pollution so important?</h2>
<p>When we breathe polluted air pollutants get into our lungs; they can enter the bloodstream and be carried to our internal organs such as the brain. This can cause severe health problems such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and even cancer and reduces the quality and number of years of life.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-causes-of-environmental-pollution-class-11>What are the major causes of environmental pollution Class 11?</h2>
<p>The pollution is not caused just because of carbon emissions and fossil fuels, but there are many more pollution including chemical pollution in water bodies and soil due to improper disposal of agriculture activities and release of chemicals.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-csr-class-11>What is CSR class 11?</h2>
<p>Social responsibility is a moral obligation on a company or an individual to take decisions or actions that is in favour and useful to society. Social responsibility in business is commonly known as Corporate Social Responsibility or CSR.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-pollution-prevention-help-protect-the-environment>How does pollution prevention help protect the environment?</h2>
<p>Pollution prevention reduces both financial costs (waste management and cleanup) and environmental costs (health problems and environmental damage). Pollution prevention protects the environment by conserving and protecting natural resources while strengthening economic growth through more efficient production…</p>
<h2 id=how-does-pollution-affect-the-quality-of-the-environment>How does pollution affect the quality of the environment?</h2>
<p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-think-we-can-contribute-to-control-environmental-problems>Do you think we can contribute to control environmental problems?</h2>
<p>Sure we can…First we should build a strong conviction in people’s minds about the impotance of our environment to humans life and the danger of pollution, then we should make suggestions for how to solve its problems as mentioned above. In my opinion, for this purpose the most important thing is to set an efficient recycling system.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-people-so-concerned-about-air-pollution>Why are people so concerned about air pollution?</h2>
<p>This can cause people to develop asthma or even allergies. People in Beijing, China, can’t breath or sometimes even see because the pollution is so heavy. 2. It causes changes to our environment. By adding new factories or buildings, it causes more dirt in the air that contributes to pollution.</p>
