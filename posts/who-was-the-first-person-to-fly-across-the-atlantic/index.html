<p>Despite their graceless landing in a bog on June 15, 1919, Alcock and Brown were the first people ever to fly nonstop across the Atlantic Ocean. Nearly a decade before Charles Lindbergh caught the…</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-fly-nonstop>Who was the first person to fly nonstop?</h2>
<p>The very first nonstoptransatlantic flight (1,890 miles) in a fixed-wing aircraft, was accomplished only 3 weeks later, in 1919, by Cpt. John Alcock and Lt. Arthur Brown, who flew from Newfoundland to England in a Vickers Night Bomber. (Lindbergh still had absolutely nothing to do with it.)[5-6]</p>

<p>In 1924, Lt. Lowell H. Smith and Lt. Erik H. Nelson took off on a journey of 26,100 miles on a round-the-world trip beginning and ending in Seattle, Washington. In 1926, Ramon Franco flew across the South Atlantic in a twin-engine flying boat from Spain to Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>

<p>The U.S. Navy achieved the first transatlantic flight eight years before Charles Lindbergh became world famous for crossing the Atlantic nonstop and alone. Three Curtiss flying boats, each with a crew of six, were involved: NC-1, NC-3, and NC-4. The Navy wanted to prove the capability of the airplane as a transoceanic weapon and technology.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-cross-the-pacific-ocean>Who was the first person to cross the Pacific Ocean?</h2>
<p>The first Pacific Ocean crossings were undoubtedly accomplished by Austronesian peoples, who, over a period of at least 5000 years, have spread out from Taiwan or the Malaysian area throughout the islands of the Pacific Ocean and even westward toward Madagascar.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-ship-to-cross-the-atlantic-ocean>What was the first ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean?</h2>
<p>In 1819, SS Savannah became the first steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean. In 1858, Cyrus West Field laid the first transatlantic telegraph cable (it quickly failed).</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-sail-around-the-world>Who was the first person to sail around the world?</h2>
<p>We consider them to be the first to discover America, the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The Portuguese sailor Ferdinand Magellan is credited as being the first man to sail around the world. He was appointed commander of a fleet of five ships by king Carlos V of Spain at the beginning of the 16th. century.</p>

<h2 id=when-did-the-first-pan-american-flight-cross-the-atlantic>When did the first Pan American flight cross the Atlantic?</h2>
<p>June 28th, 1939 was a big day, not just for Pan American, but for commercial aviation. After years of on-again, off-again negotiations, public prognostication, and the long-promised prospect of a new epoch for global travel, the first flight with paying passengers took off to cross the Atlantic.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-first-flight-across-the-atlantic-a-disaster>Why was the first flight across the Atlantic a disaster?</h2>
<p>On June 14, 1919, while the Handley Page team languished as its leaders conducted flight tests, Alcock and Brown started their flight attempt. It was a disaster. The takeoff was bumpy and treacherous. Then the radio failed. Fog overwhelmed the pilots, making navigation—conducted by sextant—next to impossible. Soon, the plane was covered in ice.</p>
