<h2 id=who-is-the-current-president-of-south-africa>Who is the current president of South Africa?</h2>
<p>The current occupant of Mahlamba Ndlopfu is Cyril Ramaphosa, President of the Republic since February 14, 2018. In the late 1930’s, Prime Minister Jan Smuts and his government organized a national competition to select the architect who would lead the construction of the new official residence of the South African head of state.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-prime-ministers-house-in-south-africa>Where is the Prime Minister’s house in South Africa?</h2>
<p>The house, formerly called Libertas, was designed by Architect Gerard Moerdijk in a traditional Cape Dutch style and completed in 1940 as the official residence for the Prime Minister of South Africa in the Bryntirion suburb of Pretoria. It is surrounded by impressive gardens.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-presidency-office-in-cape-town>Where is the Presidency office in Cape Town?</h2>
<p>De Tuynhuys (Garden House) is the Cape Town office of the Presidency of the Republic of South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-a-president-stay-in-office-in-south-africa>How long does a president stay in office in South Africa?</h2>
<p>The presidential term is five years, with a limit of two terms. Thus the electoral system attempts (at least on paper) to prevent the accumulation of power in the president as was during Apartheid or in many other African countries.</p>
