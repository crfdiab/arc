<h2 id=what-was-a-major-concern-for-marine-life-after-hurricane-floyd>What was a major concern for marine life after Hurricane Floyd?</h2>
<p>The flooding that accompanied Hurricane Floyd had identifiable short-term effects on coastal waters: an increased load of nutrients and decreased levels of oxygen and salt in estuaries.</p>
<h2 id=which-stress-on-population-is-a-direct-result-of-overcrowding>Which stress on population is a direct result of overcrowding?</h2>
<p>The answer is rapid of disease.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-earth-system-concept-emphasize>What does the Earth system concept emphasize?</h2>
<p>The earth system concept emphasizes on how everything on the earth is interconnected. Earth system in terms of four central components known as the subsystems – the hydrosphere,geosphere, atmosphere and biosphere.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-ecosystems-of-a-puddle-lake-river-jungle-mountain-top-grassland-and-deep-sea-vent-have-in-common>What do the ecosystems of a puddle Lake River jungle mountain top grassland and deep sea vent have in common?</h2>
<p>What do the ecosystems of a puddle, lake, river, jungle, mountain-top grassland, and deep-sea vent have in common? They are defined by their biotic factors and abiotic factors.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-hurricane-floyd-surprising-to-scientists>How was Hurricane Floyd surprising to scientists?</h2>
<p>How was Hurricane Floyd surprising to scientists? Rainfall totals were unusually small for a hurricane. No major fish kills occurred. Wave heights were greater than usual for a hurricane.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-hurricanes-a-problem-for-the-waste-water-lagoons>Why are hurricanes a problem for the waste water lagoons?</h2>
<p>When the lagoons become full, the waste water is often sprayed onto fields as nutrients for crops. The waste, which contains harmful bacteria like E. coli or salmonella, can wash off into local waterways and cause groundwater contamination and fish kills. Hurricanes hasten this pollution.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-four-effects-of-overcrowding>What are the four effects of overcrowding?</h2>
<p>Effects on quality of life due to crowding may include increased physical contact, lack of sleep, lack of privacy and poor hygiene practices. While population density offers an objective measure of the number of people living per unit area, overcrowding refers to people’s psychological response to density.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-psychological-effects-of-overcrowding>What are the psychological effects of overcrowding?</h2>
<p>Increased irritability and aggression. Overcrowding and noise are well known to promote restlessness, irritability and heightened aggression, something that is already having detrimental effects in many of our large cities.</p>
<h2 id=is-earth-a-open-or-closed-system>Is Earth a open or closed system?</h2>
<p>The earth is a closed system because only energy is naturally transferred outside the atmosphere. Matter needs to break physical laws in order to leave the earth’s atmosphere, and outside matter, such as meteorites, is prevented from getting in.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-almost-all-the-energy-that-drives-life-on-earth-originate>Where does almost all the energy that drives life on Earth originate?</h2>
<p>The sun, directly or indirectly, is the source of all the energy available on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=which-statement-is-true-of-ecosystems>Which statement is true of ecosystems?</h2>
<p>True – Ecosystems are dynamic and a greater input leads to a greater biodiversity.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-death-toll-of-hurricane-floyd>What was the death toll of Hurricane Floyd?</h2>
<p>As a result of Hurricane Floyd, 57 fatalities were recorded across 8 states and the Bahamas. A majority of these deaths were due to inland flooding. The storm was considered to have been the deadliest since Hurricane Agnes, which struck the eastern Atlantic seaboard as a Category 1 hurricane in 1972 claiming 122 lives.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-hurricane-sandy-affect-fish-and-wildlife>How does Hurricane Sandy affect Fish and Wildlife?</h2>
<p>Marsh grasses, crabs, minnows, fish hatchlings, insects, and myriad creatures of freshwater and estuarine environments are harmed by a surge. The salt water intrusion in these some of these areas does not drain off very quickly and can even harm or kill off bottomland forests and other coastal trees.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cost-of-hurricane-floyd-in-1999>What was the cost of Hurricane Floyd in 1999?</h2>
<p>In total, between the U.S. and the Bahamas, Hurricane Floyd is estimated to have caused between $4.5 billion (1999 USD) in damages, with $1.6 billion (1999 USD) reported damages in Pitt County, NC where the peak flood level was observed.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-rain-did-hurricane-floyd-get-in-nc>How much rain did Hurricane Floyd get in NC?</h2>
<p>In total, eastern North Carolina received between 381-508 millimeters (15-20 inches) of rain, with Wilmington, NC reportedly receiving 483 millimeters (19 inches) throughout the duration of the storm, including a record 381 millimeters (15 inches) in a 24-hour period.</p>
