<p>Soils can range from sand to clay to decomposed granite and caliche, and often needs to be amended before gardening can begin. Finding plants that can survive and thrive amidst all of these varying factors (and more) is a continuing exploration for all Albuquerque area gardeners.</p>
<h2 id=is-new-mexico-soil-acidic-or-alkaline>Is New Mexico soil acidic or alkaline?</h2>
<p>Many micronutrients, such as iron and zinc, are also more available to the plant at a 6.5 soil pH. Other nutrients for plant growth are strongly affected by soil pH. Only nitrogen, potassium, and sulfur are unaffected by soil pH. Soil pH in New Mexico is normally between 6.5 and 8.4.</p>
<h2 id=what-color-is-good-topsoil>What color is good topsoil?</h2>
<p>Soil color Generally speaking, colors that indicate good soil are dark brown, red and tan. Dark brown suggests that the soil has a good percentage of organic matter. Red reflects the oxidized iron content of the soil, while tan indicates a combination of organic matter and iron.</p>
<h2 id=is-new-mexico-sandy>Is New Mexico sandy?</h2>
<p>When people think of New Mexico, they don’t necessarily associate the state with beaches, but the Land of Enchantment is home to some lovely sandy strips and great water sources for sunbathing, swimming, water sports, and more.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-ph-of-10>What is a pH of 10?</h2>
<p>The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic. A pH greater than 7 is basic….</p>
<table><tr><th>Most H+ ions: pH = 4; or pH = 5.</th><th>Answer 4</th></tr><tr><td>Most OH- ions: pH = 10; or pH = 13.</td><td>Answer 13</td></tr><tr><td>Least H+ ions: pH = 12; or pH = 13.</td><td>Answer 13</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-soil-does-santa-fe-nm-have>What kind of soil does Santa Fe NM have?</h2>
<p>The Santa Fe series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist. Santa Fe soils are on backslopes of high hills and mountain slopes with slopes of 15 to 70 percent.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-ph-of-soil-in-new-mexico-determined>How is the pH of soil in New Mexico determined?</h2>
<p>Calcium Carbonate. For much of New Mexico, soil pH is controlled by the presence of lime (calcium carbonate). Lime acts as a buffer against changes in soil pH and can tie up phosphorus and iron, making them unavailable for plants. The percentage of calcium carbonate in soil can be determined at a soil testing lab.</p>

<p>These official state soils share the same level of distinction as official state flowers and birds. Also, representative soils have been selected for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. ^ “State Soils”. U.S. Department of Agriculture. Archived from the original on 2007-03-13.
