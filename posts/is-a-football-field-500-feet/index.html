<h2 id=is-a-football-field-500-feet>Is a football field 500 feet?</h2>
<p>1 feet to football field [U.S.] = 0.00333 football field [U.S.] 100 feet to football field [U.S.] = 0.33333 football field [U.S.] 200 feet to football field [U.S.] = 0.66667 football field [U.S.] 500 feet to football field [U.S.] = 1.66667 football field [U.S.]</p>
<h2 id=how-many-feet-is-a-football-field>How many feet is a football field?</h2>
<p>360 feet<br>
The game shall be played upon a rectangular field, 360 feet in length and 160 feet in width. The lines at each end of the field are termed End Lines.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-football-field-1000-feet>Is a football field 1000 feet?</h2>
<p>A football field is 300 feet long, so a 1,000-foot stretch covers the length of three and one-third football fields. A mile contains 5,280 feet, so 1,000 feet make up about 19 percent of a mile. In metric terms, 1,000 feet converts to 304.8 meters, which is 3/10 of a kilometer.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-standard-size-of-football-ground>What is the standard size of football ground?</h2>
<p>The field of play should be 125m x 85m (136 x 93 yards), or a minimum of 120m x 80m (131 x 87 yards) and there must be a minimum of 1.5m of pitch beyond the marked playing area. The same dimensions apply to pitches used in continental UEFA competitions.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-feet-is-a-100-yard-football-field>How many feet is a 100 yard football field?</h2>
<p>The equivalent of 100 yards, which is the length of a football field from goal line to goal line, is about 300 feet. One yard is equal to 3 feet. Given that 36 inches make up a yard, 100 yards is composed of 3,600 inches.</p>
<h2 id=are-all-football-fields-the-same-size>Are all football fields the same size?</h2>
<p>Standard pitch measurements. Not all pitches are the same size, though the preferred size for many professional teams’ stadiums is 105 by 68 metres (115 yd × 74 yd) with an area of 7,140 square metres (76,900 sq ft; 1.76 acres; 0.714 ha).</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-a-football-field-in-yards>How big is a football field in yards?</h2>
<p>How long is a football field? Football Fields are 360’ (109.75 m) long. Measured in yards (each yard is 3 feet), a football playing field is 100 yards with a 10 yard deep end-zone at each end of the field.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-football-fields-are-in-5-acres>How many football fields are in 5 acres?</h2>
<p>Answer: 4.5375 football fields in 5 acres Math: An acre is equal to 43,560 square feet A foot ball field (300 feet X 160 feet) is 48,000 square feet 5 acres = 5 X 43,560 square feet = 217,800 square feet 217,800 square feet / 48,000 square feet = 4.5375 football fields How many football fields can you fit in a square mile?</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-end-zone-on-a-football-field>How tall is the end zone on a football field?</h2>
<p>In professional football fields, the coaches and team’s box dimensions may vary a little from college or high school. Q: How long is a football field? A: From end zone to end zone, it is 100 yards or 300 feet. Counting the end zones, it’s 360 feet long. Q: How tall are the goal posts on a football field?</p>
<h2 id=how-to-convert-square-feet-to-football-fields>How to convert square feet to football fields?</h2>
<p>How to convert Square Feet to Football Fields (ft2, sq ft to ff)? 1 x 1.7361103973584E-5 ff = 1.7361103973584E-5 Football Fields. Always check the results; rounding errors may occur.</p>
