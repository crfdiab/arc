<h2 id=what-are-examples-of-citizen-participation>What are examples of citizen participation?</h2>
<p>Examples include voting, volunteering, participating in group activities, and community gardening. Some are individual activities that benefit society (e.g., voting) or group activities that benefit either the group members (e.g., recreational soccer teams) or society (e.g., volunteer organizations).</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-political-culture-does-mexico-have>What type of political culture does Mexico have?</h2>
<p>The politics of Mexico take place in a framework of a federal presidential representative democratic republic whose government is based on a congressional system, whereby the President of Mexico is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-democracy-participation>What is democracy participation?</h2>
<p>Participatory democracy or participative democracy is a model of democracy in which citizens are provided power to make political decisions. Etymological roots of democracy (Greek demos and kratos) imply that the people are in power, making all democracies participatory to some degree.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-become-a-citizen-of-mexico>When do you become a citizen of Mexico?</h2>
<p>If you were born in Mexico, you’re automatically considered a Mexican citizen. The citizenship process is typically taken care of during a child’s first year, but can also be completed after that, as long as you have the proper documentation. Be a permanent resident of Mexico for 5 years if you were born in a foreign country.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-political-parties-in-mexico>What are the major political parties in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Among the lesser parties are the Mexican Ecological Green Party (Partido Verde Ecologista Mexicano; PVEM), the leftist Labour Party (Partido del Trabajo; PT), and the Democratic Convergence Party (PCD). Mexico also has several small communist parties.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-responsibilities-of-being-a-citizen-of-mexico>What are the responsibilities of being a citizen of Mexico?</h2>
<p>The obligations of Mexican citizenship include sending your children to school, reporting for any obligatory military or civil instruction, enlisting and serving in the National Guard, and paying taxes. Thanks! Can I get citizenship through my parents?</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-government-do-they-have-in-mexico>What kind of government do they have in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Most states have a unicameral legislature called the Chamber of Deputies, whose members serve three-year terms. Governors are popularly elected to six-year terms and may not be reelected. Because of Mexico’s tradition of highly centralized government, state and local budgets are largely dependent on federally allocated funds.</p>
