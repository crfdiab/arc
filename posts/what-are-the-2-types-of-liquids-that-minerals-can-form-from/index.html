<h2 id=what-are-the-2-types-of-liquids-that-minerals-can-form-from>What are the 2 types of liquids that minerals can form from?</h2>
<p>Minerals can form from volcanic gases, sediment formation, oxidation, crystallization from magma, or deposition from a saline fluid, to list a few.</p>
<h2 id=what-minerals-form-when-water-evaporates>What minerals form when water evaporates?</h2>
<p>Gypsum (calcium sulphate) is a soft white mineral which often forms by evaporation along low-lying shores like those of the Arabian Gulf.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-minerals-form-from-hot-water>How do minerals form from hot water?</h2>
<p>Some minerals form from hot water solutions. When a hot water solution heated by magma deep underground begins to cool, the elements and compounds leave the solution and crystallize as minerals. Pure metals that crystallize from hot water solutions underground often form veins.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-crystals-form-underground>How do crystals form underground?</h2>
<p>In underground cavities, crystals grow through atoms that connect in regular three-dimensional patterns. Each crystal starts small and grows as more atoms are added. Many grow in water that is rich of dissolved minerals. However, this is not a condition, crystals can also grow from molten rock or even fumes.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-2-main-types-of-luster>What are the 2 main types of luster?</h2>
<p>There are two main types of luster: metallic and nonmetallic. There are several subtypes of nonmetallic luster, namely vitreous, resinous, pearly, greasy, silky, adamantine, dull, and waxy.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-scientific-name-for-fools-gold>What is the scientific name for fool’s gold?</h2>
<p>“Fool’s Gold” is technically known as pyrite or iron sulfide (FeS2) and is one of the most common sulfide minerals. In addition to pyrite, common sulfides are chalcopyrite (copper iron sulfide), pentlandite (nickel iron sulfide), and galena (lead sulfide).</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-that-the-faster-magma-cools-the-smaller-the-mineral-crystals-form>Is it true that the faster magma cools the smaller the mineral crystals form?</h2>
<p>The rate of cooling is very important. If the magma cools slowly then the reactions proceed for a longer period of time and the resulting mineral crystals (grains) become large. If the magma cools rapidly then the reactions are much quicker and the mineral crystals (grains) are smaller.</p>
<h2 id=when-minerals-are-deposited-from-hot-underground-water-and-fill-the-cracks-in-rocks-they-are-called>When minerals are deposited from hot underground water and fill the cracks in rocks they are called?</h2>
<p>Minerals from Hot Underground Water The hot water moves through cracks below Earth’s surface. When a mineral fills cracks in rocks, the deposits are called veins. Pictured below is a white quartz vein (Figure below). When the minerals are deposited in open spaces, large crystals grow. These rocks are called geodes.</p>
<h2 id=how-fast-do-crystals-grow>How fast do crystals grow?</h2>
<p>It has been estimated that they can grow about one atomic layer per year ( a two centimeter crystal growing over a period of ten million years ). In mines, crystals can grow extremely fast.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-most-crystals-found>Where are the most crystals found?</h2>
<p>Buried beneath the Sierra de Naica mountain in Chihuahua, northern Mexico, the Cueva de los Cristales (Cave of Crystals) is home to the largest crystals on planet Earth.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-underground-heat-up-in-the-winter>How does the underground heat up in the winter?</h2>
<p>You could even have a solar powered fan blow hot air through a solar collector then underground. In the winter, close the outside connection and hook it up to blow through a closed loop that draws the stored heat from the ground to your basement all winter. I don’t really have any university studies to back up what I am saying.</p>
<h2 id=how-deep-does-the-underground-begin-to-warm>How deep does the underground begin to warm?</h2>
<p>The point where it gets significantly warmer is probably much deeper than you want to go. A better system would probably be to bury two separate loops that are 6 or 8 ft deep. One is the heat loop on one side of the house and the second could be the cool loop on the other side of the house.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-water-hot-at-hot-springs>What makes the water hot at Hot Springs?</h2>
<p>The water that you’re seeing here comes out of the ground at about an average temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 61 degrees Centigrade. The reason it has no odor and doesn’t have a taste is that there’s a general lack of sulfur compounds that are common with volcanic heat sources.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-ground-heat-up-in-the-summer>How does the ground heat up in the summer?</h2>
<p>In the summer, use the cool frozen loop to connect to your house instead of the outside air. The opposite is done with the heat loop on the other side of the house. Heat the ground all summer with outside air. You could even have a solar powered fan blow hot air through a solar collector then underground.</p>
