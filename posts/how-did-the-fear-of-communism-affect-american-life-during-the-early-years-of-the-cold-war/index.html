<p>Americans also felt the effects of the Red Scare on a personal level, and thousands of alleged communist sympathizers saw their lives disrupted. They were hounded by law enforcement, alienated from friends and family and fired from their jobs.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-united-states-fear-the-soviet-union>Why did the United States fear the Soviet Union?</h2>
<p>Americans feared that the Soviet Union hoped to spread communism all over the world, overthrowing both democratic and capitalist institutions as it went.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-us-and-soviet-union-become-enemies>When did the us and Soviet Union become enemies?</h2>
<p>At the start of the 1920s, the first Red Scare swept across the United States. Communism became associated with foreigners and anti-American values. As a result, Americans grew increasingly hostile toward the Soviet Union during this time period.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-the-us-and-soviet-union>What was the relationship between the us and Soviet Union?</h2>
<p>Although relations between the Soviet Union and the United States had been strained in the years before World War II, the U.S.-Soviet alliance of 1941–1945 was marked by a great degree of cooperation and was essential to securing the defeat of Nazi Germany.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-fear-of-communism-during-the-cold-war>What was the fear of communism during the Cold War?</h2>
<p>In the United States, the Cold War caused increased feelings of nationalism and anti-communist spirit. For Americans during the Cold War, communism was not so much recognized for being an economic system or a legitimate political affiliation as it was a symbol of the Soviet Union and therefore a threat to the American way of life.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-communism-affect-the-us-during-the-red-scare>How did communism affect the US during the Red Scare?</h2>
<p>Communism influenced American’s trust in the government and led to an increase in political conservatism. Many Americans supported conservative political agendas during the Red Scare because the conservatives strongly opposed communism.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-communism-a-threat-to-the-united-states>Why was communism a threat to the United States?</h2>
<p>For Americans during the Cold War, communism was not so much recognized for being an economic system or a legitimate political affiliation as it was a symbol of the Soviet Union and therefore a threat to the American way of life.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-anti-communism-movement-start-in-america>When did the anti communism movement start in America?</h2>
<p>Anti-communism formally started in 1917 after the Russian revolution and gained global acceptance in the course of the Cold War, in the heat of the tension between America and the Soviet Union. The first organized body that opposed communism was the Russian White Movement in 1918.</p>
