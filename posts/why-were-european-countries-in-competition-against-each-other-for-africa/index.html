<h2 id=why-were-european-countries-in-competition-against-each-other-for-africa>Why were European countries in competition against each other for Africa?</h2>
<p>The rapid expansion of industries made European countries look to African for a supply of cheap raw materials and (slave) labour. West Africa was particularly important for the development of industries in Europe. The production of African palm oil used as industrial oil was in high demand for European industries.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-did-not-fight-for-africa>Which country did not fight for Africa?</h2>
<p>The sovereign nation of ​Liberia is often described as never colonized because it was created so recently, in 1847. Liberia was founded by Americans in 1821 and remained under their control for just over 17 years before partial independence was achieved through the declaration of a commonwealth on April 4, 1839.</p>
<h2 id=which-nation-is-on-the-horn-of-africa>Which nation is on the Horn of Africa?</h2>
<p>Horn of Africa, region of eastern Africa. It is the easternmost extension of African land and for the purposes of this article is defined as the region that is home to the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia, whose cultures have been linked throughout their long history.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-european-powers-want-to-colonize-africa>Why did European powers want to colonize Africa?</h2>
<p>Simply because European powers were developing the economic potentials of their colonies does not mean that the colonies were established for that purpose.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-europe-involved-in-africa-in-the-1880s>Why was Europe involved in Africa in the 1880s?</h2>
<p>While Europeans and Africans had established relationships in a variety of settings for centuries, the 1880s mark a major turning point in European attitudes toward Africa. Three primary developments explain increased European involvement in Africa. You have explored these developments in previous material.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-countries-that-had-colonies-in-africa>Who are the countries that had colonies in Africa?</h2>
<p>Britain and France had the largest amount of control in Africa, but Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Portugal also had colonies.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-africa-given-independence-after-world-war-2>Why was Africa given independence after World War 2?</h2>
<p>Yet there was a time not too long ago when Africa was viewed with considerable optimism. After World War II, colonial empires quickly became politically untenable, and European powers were forced to grant their African colonies independence, with varying amounts of haste.</p>
