<h2 id=what-are-some-herbivores-in-the-mountains>What are some herbivores in the mountains?</h2>
<p>These habitats are home to a great deal of wildlife from herbivores, such as elk, moose, mule deer, mountain goat and bighorn sheep, to predators like cougar, Canada lynx, bobcat, black bear, grizzly bear, gray wolf, coyote, fox, and wolverine, along with a great variety of small mammals, fish, reptiles and amphibians.</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-live-in-mountain-biomes>What animals live in mountain biomes?</h2>
<p>Fauna include deer, bears, wolves, mountain lions, squirrels, rabbits, and a wide variety of birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. Tropical areas are known for their species diversity and this holds true for the mountains found there. Trees grow tall and at elevations higher than in other climate zones.</p>
<h2 id=what-plants-live-in-mountain-biomes>What plants live in mountain biomes?</h2>
<p>These include perennial grasses, sedges, forbs, cushion plants, mosses, and lichens. Alpine plants are adapted to the harsh conditions of the alpine environment, which include low temperatures, dryness, ultraviolet radiation, wind, drought, poor nutritional soil, and a short growing season.</p>
<h2 id=what-biome-is-mountain>What biome is mountain?</h2>
<p>Alpine biomes<br>
Alpine biomes are found in mountain regions worldwide, including the Andes, Alps, and Rocky Mountains. The alpine biome usually lies between an altitude of about 10,000 feet (3,000 meters), and the place where the snow line of a mountain begins.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-are-herbivores-and-what-do-they-eat>What kind of animals are herbivores and what do they eat?</h2>
<p>These animals eat grass, tree bark, aquatic vegetation, and shrubby growth. Herbivores can also be medium-sized animals such as sheep and goats, which eat shrubby vegetation and grasses. Small herbivores include rabbits, chipmunks, squirrels, and mice. These animals eat grass, shrubs, seeds, and nuts.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-herbivore-in-the-tropical-rain-forest>Which is an herbivore in the tropical rain forest?</h2>
<p>Gorillas- Gorillas are large primates native to the tropical rain forests of equatorial Africa. They are almost completely herbivores, with invertebrates like insects making up an infinitesimal part of their diets.</p>

<p>Fauna include deer, bears, wolves, mountain lions, squirrels, rabbits, and a wide variety of birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. Tropical areas are known for their species diversity and this holds true for the mountains found there.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-vegetation-does-the-rocky-mountains-have>What kind of vegetation does the Rocky Mountains have?</h2>
<p>Temperate zone mountains Mountains in the temperate zone, such as the Rocky Mountains in Colorado generally have four distinct seasons. They usually have conifer trees on their lower slopes that fade into alpine vegetation (such as lupins and daisies,) above the tree line.</p>
