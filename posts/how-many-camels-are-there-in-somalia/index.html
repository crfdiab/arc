<h2 id=how-many-camels-are-there-in-somalia>How many camels are there in Somalia?</h2>
<p>Of the world’s estimated 14 million camels, Somalia, a country of some 10 million people, has more than seven million – the highest number in the world. Livestock is the backbone of the Somali economy with more than 65 percent of the population engaged in some way in the industry, according to the FAO.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-camels-important-in-somalia>Why are camels important in Somalia?</h2>
<p>In the Somali pastoral lifestyle, camels play multiple roles, of which milk production is perhaps the most important. Also, in the Somali traditional economy, camels are the main reserve stock, and therefore act as a store of wealth and security against drought, disease and other natural calamities.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-camel-in-somalia>How much is a camel in Somalia?</h2>
<p>Steady prices Camels weighing 300 kg are sold at about $700 per head. Analysis of these average farm-gate prices indicates that Somali livestock producers could have earned more than USD 380 million in 2015 from animal exports.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-somalis-love-camels>Why do Somalis love camels?</h2>
<p>CULTURE : Through the Ages, the Camel Helps Somalia Over the Hump : Animals are symbols of toughness in a hardscrabble society. Call them haughty, individualistic, clannish, rugged, crafty–maybe even selfish and merciless, Somalis say.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-camel-worth>How much is a camel worth?</h2>
<p>But how much does a camel cost? Faisal says that a camel’s price starts from about $55,000 (£40,000) but thoroughbreds can go for a lot more. Back in 2010 an Emirati camel-racing fan spent £6.5m on three camels. The prices of winning camels go even higher – from between $5-10m, but for some can fetch up to $30m.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-the-most-camels>Which country has the most camels?</h2>
<p>Australia<br>
Australia is famous for its wildlife – kangaroos, koalas and numerous species of snakes and spiders – but it is also home to the world’s largest herd of camels. There are about 750,000 roaming wild in the outback and they cause a host of problems.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-camel-baby>What is the camel baby?</h2>
<p>calves<br>
Baby camels are called calves. The newborn calf is able to walk within 30 minutes, though the two won’t rejoin the herd until around two weeks later. Camels become fully mature when they are 7 years old. Camels live around 17 years.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-giraffes-in-somalia>Are there giraffes in Somalia?</h2>
<p>The reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata), also known as the Somali giraffe, is a species of giraffe native to the Horn of Africa. It lives in Somalia, southern Ethiopia, and northern Kenya. There are approximately 8,500 individuals living in the wild. Giraffes are the tallest mammals in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-expensive-camel>What is the most expensive camel?</h2>
<p>Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashed al-Maktoum, crown prince of the United Arab Emirates of Dubai, purchased the female camel for 10 million dirhams (2.72 million dollars) at a camel beauty pageant in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-camel-worth-in-israel>How much is a camel worth in Israel?</h2>
<p>“A camel costs between $2,344and $2,930, so it’s an asset that has a lot of value.”</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-word-camel-come-from-in-somalia>Where does the word camel come from in Somalia?</h2>
<p>In Somalia, camels have held in such high esteem that the Somali language includes 46 different words for ‘camel.’ The English word ‘camel’ is thought to derive from the Arabic word Ǧamāl, which means handsome–and indeed, camels are quite dashing, with their long, slender necks, regal air, and impossibly long eyelashes.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-do-people-in-somalia-have>What kind of animals do people in Somalia have?</h2>
<p>According to the Central Bank of Somalia, about 80% of the population are nomadic or semi-nomadic pastoralists, who keep camels, goats, sheep and cattle. The herders also gather resins and gums to supplement their income.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-highest-population-of-camels-in-the-world>Where is the highest population of camels in the world?</h2>
<p>It is prestigious to own a camel in Somalia. Somalia is believed to be the original home of the domesticated dromedary camel. The country has the highest camel population in the world.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-dromedary-camels-are-there-in-the-world>How many dromedary camels are there in the world?</h2>
<p>There are almost 14 million Dromedary camels alive today that are domesticated animals, mostly living in Somalia, Sudan, Mauritania and nearby countries. The Bactrian camel once had an enormous range, however, it is now reduced to an estimated 1.4 million animals, mostly domesticated.</p>
