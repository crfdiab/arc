<h2 id=why-is-latin-america-becoming-protestant>Why is Latin America becoming Protestant?</h2>
<p>Latin Americans who converted from Catholicism to Protestantism most often said they did so because they were seeking a more personal connection with God. The change has political and religious implications.</p>
<h2 id=what-religion-is-the-majority-of-latinos>What religion is the majority of Latinos?</h2>
<p>Roman Catholic<br>
Latinos and Hispanics are predominantly Christians in the United States. Specifically, they are most often Roman Catholic.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-the-people-are-considered-protestant>What percentage of the people are considered Protestant?</h2>
<p>Protestants account for nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide and more than one tenth of the total human population.</p>
<h2 id=what-percent-of-mexicans-are-christians>What percent of Mexicans are Christians?</h2>
<p>Catholic Christianity is the dominant religion in Mexico, representing about 82.7% of the total population as of 2010….Census information.</p>
<table><tr><th>State</th><td>Mexico</td></tr><tr><th>Catholic</th><td>91.2%</td></tr><tr><th>Protestant and Evangelical</th><td>3.8%</td></tr><tr><th>Other Christian</th><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><th>Jewish</th><td>0.1%</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-largest-protestant-denomination-in-the-united-states>What is the largest Protestant denomination in the United States?</h2>
<p>The Southern Baptist Convention<br>
The Southern Baptist Convention is the largest single Protestant denomination in the U.S., comprising one-tenth of American Protestants.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-protestants-are-there-in-the-united-states>How many Protestants are there in the United States?</h2>
<p>Protestantism in the United States. Protestantism is the largest grouping of Christians in the United States with its combined denominations collectively accounting for about half the country’s population or 150 million people. Simultaneously, this corresponds to around 20% of the world’s total Protestant population.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-religion-does-the-majority-of-latinos-have>What kind of religion does the majority of Latinos have?</h2>
<p>The Pew Research Center’s 2013 National Survey of Latinos and Religion finds that a majority (55%) of the nation’s estimated 35.4 million Latino adults – or about 19.6 million Latinos – identify as Catholic today. 1 About 22% are Protestant (including 16% who describe themselves as born-again or evangelical) and 18% are religiously unaffiliated.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hispanics-are-catholics-in-united-states>How many Hispanics are Catholics in United States?</h2>
<p>Even though the percentage of Hispanics who identify as Catholic has been declining, Hispanics continue to make up an increasingly large share of U.S. Catholics. Indeed, as of 2013, one-third (33%) of all U.S. Catholics were Hispanic, according to Pew Research surveys.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-a-decline-in-catholic-affiliation-among-latinos>Why is there a decline in Catholic affiliation among Latinos?</h2>
<p>The decline in Catholic affiliation among Latinos is due, at least in part, to changes in religious affiliation since childhood. Three-quarters of Latino adults in the new survey (77%) say they were raised as Catholics, while just over half (55%) currently describe themselves as Catholics.</p>
