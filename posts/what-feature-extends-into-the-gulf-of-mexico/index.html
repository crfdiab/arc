<h2 id=what-feature-extends-into-the-gulf-of-mexico>What feature extends into the Gulf of Mexico?</h2>
<p>An important feature of the Gulf of Mexico is the Gulf Stream, which is a warm Atlantic current that begins in the region and flows north into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-physical-features-of-the-gulf-coastal-plains>What are the physical features of the Gulf coastal plains?</h2>
<p>Texas’ Gulf Coastal Plains are the western extension of the coastal plain extending from the Atlantic Ocean to beyond the Rio Grande. Its characteristic rolling to hilly surface covered with a heavy growth of pine and hardwoods extends into East Texas.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-say-about-the-physical-characteristic-of-the-gulf-of-thailand>What can you say about the physical characteristic of the gulf of Thailand?</h2>
<p>The gulf is relatively shallow: its mean depth is 58 metres (190 ft) and the maximum depth is only 85 metres (279 ft). This makes water exchange slow, and the strong water inflow from the rivers reduce the level of salinity in the gulf (3.05–3.25 percent) and enriches the sediments.</p>
<h2 id=do-the-coastal-plains-border-the-gulf-of-mexico>Do the Coastal Plains border the Gulf of Mexico?</h2>
<p>The Gulf Coastal Plain, which is much wider than its Pacific coast counterpart, extends some 900 miles (1,450 km) along the Gulf of Mexico from Tamaulipas state (on the Texas border) through Veracruz and Tabasco states to the Yucatán Peninsula; it includes the Tabasco Plain in…</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-gulf-coast-prairies-and-marshes-known-for>What is the Gulf coast Prairies and Marshes known for?</h2>
<p>The 600-mile – long region abounds in superlatives: the longest barrier island system on Earth, the most important fish nursery in the Gulf, the largest hypersaline lagoon known to man.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-natural-features-of-the-gulf-of-mexico>What are the natural features of the Gulf of Mexico?</h2>
<p>Recreational fishing is popular, as are water sports and tourism along the coastal regions. The Gulf of Mexico is a highly biodiverse area and features many coastal wetlands and mangrove forests. The wetlands along the Gulf of Mexico cover around 5 million acres (2.02 million hectares).</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-gulf-coastal-plain-begin-and-end>Where does the Gulf Coastal Plain begin and end?</h2>
<p>The Gulf Coastal Plain also extends into southern Mexico and up to the northern west coast states of the US. The Gulf Coastal Plain is a westward extension of the Atlantic Coastal Plain around the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-gulf-of-mexico-part-of-the-atlantic-ocean>Is the Gulf of Mexico part of the Atlantic Ocean?</h2>
<p>The Gulf of Mexico is a large ocean basin near the Southeastern United States. It is a part of the Atlantic Ocean and is bounded by Mexico to the southwest, Cuba to the southeast, and the Gulf Coast of the United States on the north, which includes the states of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas ( map ).</p>

<p>Fig. 1. Northern Gulf of Mexico deepwater bathymetry grid created from 3-D seismic surveys. The grid defines water depth with 1.4 billion 12 × 12 meter cells and is available in feet and meters. BOEM grid coverage is limited to the area defined by rainbow colors. Shaded relief is vertically exaggerated by a factor of 5.</p>
