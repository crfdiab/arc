<h2 id=how-did-militarism-cause-ww1>How did militarism cause ww1?</h2>
<p>The main event of Militarism causing World War one was the naval rivalry which was made after 1900. The Kaiser felt he needed a bigger navy than Britain to protect its country. While Britain and Germany built up their navies, the major powers on mainland Europe were also building up their armies.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-industrialization-lead-to-military-buildup-among-countries-in-europe>How did industrialization lead to military buildup among countries in Europe?</h2>
<p>How did industrialization affect the growth of the military in the nations of Europe? It led to new methods of shipbuilding and new weapons. Austria-Hungary was concerned about Serbia’s desire to be an independent state because of what? of Austria-Hungary’s worries about its own Slavic minorities.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-a-military-buildup-in-europe-in-the-early-1900s>Why was there a military buildup in Europe in the early 1900s?</h2>
<p>Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, European countries had undertaken a massive military buildup. This militarism was caused mostly by the desire to protect overseas colonies from other nations. The growing power of Europe’s armed forces left all sides anxious and ready to act at the first sign of trouble.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-militarism-considered-a-long-term-cause-of-world-war-i>Why is militarism considered a long term cause of World War I?</h2>
<p>Long/Short: Militarism was a long-term cause of the war; due to the length of time it takes a country to build its military to the strength necessary to wage a major war. Though these were not the only countries building and perfecting their arsenal, they were the most significant prior to the outbreak of WWI.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-militarism-in-ww1>What was militarism in ww1?</h2>
<p>Militarism is a philosophy or system that emphasises the importance of military power. Alfred Vagts, a German historian who served in World War I, defined it as the “domination of the military man over the civilian, an undue preponderance of military demands, an emphasis on military considerations”.</p>
<h2 id=what-2-countries-led-the-way-for-military-build-up>What 2 countries led the way for military build up?</h2>
<p>This included the countries of Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary. The reason for the military buildup was primarily nationalism in which each country wanted to be “better” than the others….HMS Dreadnought.</p>

<h2 id=why-did-the-us-build-up-the-military-during-world-war-1>Why did the US build up the military during World War 1?</h2>
<p>The two countries started building bigger and stronger vessels in case a war broke out. New technology also led to the creation of new machines and weapons. Machine guns and artillery made it possible to hit a target more accurately.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-germany-build-a-navy-during-world-war-1>Why did Germany build a Navy during World War 1?</h2>
<p>Towards the end of the 19th century , however, Germany started to build a powerful navy and wanted it to be as powerful as the British . The two countries started building bigger and stronger vessels in case a war broke out. New technology also led to the creation of new machines and weapons.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-austria-hungary-and-russia-fight-in-world-war-1>Why did Austria-Hungary and Russia fight in World War 1?</h2>
<p>Austria-Hungary and Russia saw that the Turkish Empire’s power had diminished and started to spread their influence to the Balkans. Serbia became a powerful state that wanted to unite the people of the Balkans. Austria-Hungary, on the other side, was afraid of this because it had many Slavic groups in its own empire.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-germany-form-alliances-in-world-war-1>Why did Germany form alliances in World War 1?</h2>
<p>Alliances could also make countries take part in a war they did not want, thus a conflict could spread over many countries, possibly even the whole continent. At the end of the 19th century Germany’s chancellor Otto von Bismarck set up alliances to strengthen Germany’s position in Europe.</p>
