<h2 id=what-was-the-first-train-station-in-london>What was the first train station in London?</h2>
<p>Euston<br>
Close to King’s Cross and walkable to all the major central attractions, this is one busy hub. Euston was actually the first intercity station in London, and it opened in 1837 on what was mostly farmland at the outskirts of the expanding city.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-oldest-train-station-in-england>What is the oldest train station in England?</h2>
<p>Opened in 1830, Liverpool Road station in Manchester is the oldest surviving railway terminus building in the world. Opened in 1836, Spa Road railway station in London was the city’s first terminus and also the world’s first elevated station and terminus.</p>
<h2 id=which-london-underground-station-is-the-oldest>Which London Underground station is the oldest?</h2>
<p>Opened in 1863, The Metropolitan Railway between Paddington and Farringdon was the first, urban, underground railway in the world.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-the-most-railway-stations>Which country has the most railway stations?</h2>
<p>United States<br>

<h2 id=which-station-has-the-most-platforms-in-london>Which station has the most platforms in London?</h2>
<p>Baker Street<br>
The station with the most platforms is Baker Street with 10 (Moorgate also has 10 platforms but only six are used by Tube trains – others are used by overground trains).</p>

<h2 id=which-is-the-oldest-train-station-in-the-uk>Which is the oldest train station in the UK?</h2>
<p>Although there’s been an underground running in the city for over a century, it can’t claim to be the oldest. The honour of oldest underground station belongs to the UK’s largest city, and an underground railway that’s a cultural icon in itself.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-main-train-station-in-london>Which is the main train station in London?</h2>
<p>Paddington is the main London terminus for trains from south Wales and the West of England. This is a list of the 369 heavy rail passenger stations in and around London, England (330 being within the boundary of Greater London) that are accessible using Transport for London tickets and passes.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-london-underground-line-is-the-oldest>Which is London Underground line is the oldest?</h2>
<p>There was a 150th anniversary celebration in 2013. But some tube-purists don’t count the “cut-and-cover” lines like the Metropolitan. The first “true” tube line in London was the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line) which opened in 1890. Which London Underground line is the oldest? I have absolutely no idea.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-longest-serving-railway-station-in-the-world>Which is the longest serving railway station in the world?</h2>
<p>You can still grab a ticket to ride from Broad Green station, the world’s longest-serving passenger railway station. Developed as part of the same Liverpool and Manchester line as Liverpool Road, Broad Green is the last of the stations opened in 1830.</p>
