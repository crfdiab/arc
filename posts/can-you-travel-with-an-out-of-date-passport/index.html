<p>No, TSA will not accept an expired passport for a flight. For international travel, a valid passport is essential. For domestic flights, a valid passport isn’t essential, but you must have some form of valid photo identification that hasn’t expired.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-your-passport-expires-abroad>What happens if your passport expires abroad?</h2>
<p>If you are overseas and your passport expired on or after January 1, 2020, you may be able to use your expired passport to return directly to the United States until December 31, 2021. Or, if you were 15 years of age or younger when the passport was issued, your expired passport was valid for 5 years.</p>
