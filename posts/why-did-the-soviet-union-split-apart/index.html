<h2 id=why-did-the-soviet-union-split-apart>Why did the Soviet Union split apart?</h2>
<p>Gorbachev’s decision to allow elections with a multi-party system and create a presidency for the Soviet Union began a slow process of democratization that eventually destabilized Communist control and contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-russia-get-divided>When did Russia get divided?</h2>
<p>A series of events from 1989 to 1991 led to the final collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), paving the way for the establishment of new, independent republics in the Baltics and Central Asia and the creation of the Russian Federation.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-workers-in-russia-a-divided-social>How were workers in Russia a divided social?</h2>
<p>Workers in Russia were divided by skill. Metal workers considered themselves aristocrats among other workers. Their occupation demanded more training and skill. Women made up 31 per cent of the factory labour force by 1914, but they were paid less than men. Divisions among workers showed themselves in dress and manners too.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-russia-become-a-country-in-europe>When did Russia become a country in Europe?</h2>
<p>Although Russian territory now encompasses parts of both Europe and Asia, the origins of Russia as a nation are in Europe, beginning with the establishment of the first Slavic state, Kievan Rus, in the 9 th century CE, which was centered around the city of Kiev, now the capital of present-day Ukraine.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-republics-are-there-in-the-russian-federation>How many republics are there in the Russian Federation?</h2>
<p>Republics of Russia. According to the Constitution, the Russian Federation is divided into 85 federal subjects (constituent units), 22 of which are “republics”.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-soviet-union-create-the-republics>When did the Soviet Union create the republics?</h2>
<p>The republics were established in early Soviet Russia. On 15 November 1917, Vladimir Lenin issued the Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia, giving Russia’s minorities the right to self-determination. However, most of these new states would be re-conquered by the Soviets during the Russian Civil War.</p>
