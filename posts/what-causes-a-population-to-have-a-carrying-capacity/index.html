<h2 id=what-causes-a-population-to-have-a-carrying-capacity>What causes a population to have a carrying capacity?</h2>
<p>Carrying capacity can be defined as a species’ average population size in a particular habitat. The species population size is limited by environmental factors like adequate food, shelter, water, and mates. If these needs are not met, the population will decrease until the resource rebounds.</p>
<h2 id=what-factors-determine-the-size-of-a-population-in-an-ecosystem>What factors determine the size of a population in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Population growth is based on four fundamental factors: birth rate, death rate, immigration, and emigration.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-limiting-factors-and-carrying-capacity>What is the relationship between limiting factors and carrying capacity?</h2>
<p>Carrying Capacity is the total frequency of individuals within a community a habitat can sustain. Limiting Factors are biotic or abiotic factors which limit the carrying capacity. For example, within a population of foxes, there is enough space and water for 20 individuals.</p>
<h2 id=what-factors-determine-the-carrying-capacity-of-an-ecosystem>What factors determine the carrying capacity of an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>– Population Education What Factors Determine the Carrying Capacity of an Ecosystem? Carrying capacity, or the maximum number of individuals that an environment can sustain over time without destroying or degrading the environment, is determined by a few key factors: food availability, water, and space.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-a-population-exceeds-its-carrying-capacity>What happens if a population exceeds its carrying capacity?</h2>
<p>Limiting factors- such as the availability of living and nonliving resources as well as challenges such as predation, competition, and disease. What would happen if a population were to exceed its carrying capacity? The death rate of the population would increase. How do invasive species impact the carrying capacity of ecosystems?</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-carrying-capacity-and>What is the relationship between carrying capacity and?</h2>
<p>Explanation: Carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of individuals of a certain species an environment can maintain in the long-term. Factors that will determine carrying capacity include amount of water available in the environment, geographic size of environment, energy sources available, and so forth.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-pollution-affect-the-carrying-capacity-of-the-environment>How does pollution affect the carrying capacity of the environment?</h2>
<p>Pollution may also affect an environment’s carrying capacity. A natural disaster, such as a hurricane or a flood, also affects the ability of an environment to sustain animal or plant populations.</p>
