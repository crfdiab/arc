<h2 id=what-jobs-do-indigenous-australians-do>What jobs do Indigenous Australians do?</h2>
<p>In 2016 the four most common occupations of employed Indigenous Australians aged 15–64 in their main job were Community and personal service workers (18%), General labourers (16%), Technicians and trades workers (14%), and Professionals (14%).</p>
<h2 id=what-were-aboriginals-used-for>What were Aboriginals used for?</h2>
<p>Aboriginal people were blackbirded and used in the pearling, sugar cane and cattle industries. They suffered terrible abuse and were denied their wages.</p>
<h2 id=do-aboriginals-have-a-special-day>Do Aboriginals have a special day?</h2>
<p>26 January. While January 26 is a day of celebration for many Australians, it’s a day of mourning for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. January 26 marks the day that New South Wales was established as a colony in 1788.</p>
<h2 id=what-days-do-aboriginals-get>What days do Aboriginals get?</h2>
<p>Culturally important dates</p>
<ul>
<li>13 February Anniversary of National Apology Day.</li>
<li>18 March National Close the Gap Day.</li>
<li>26 May National Sorry Day.</li>
<li>27 May 1967 Referendum.</li>

<li>3 June Mabo Day.</li>
<li>1 July Coming of the Light.</li>
<li>4 July to 11 July NAIDOC Week.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-do-people-not-hire-indigenous-people>Why do people not hire indigenous people?</h2>
<p>The top three barriers to recruiting Indigenous employees are: finding Indigenous candidates to interview/recruit; a lack of education or training credentials on the part of candidates; and a lack of technical, job related skills.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-aboriginal-people-do-in-australia>What did the Aboriginal people do in Australia?</h2>
<p>It has long been conventionally held that Australia is the only continent where the entire Indigenous population maintained a single kind of adaptation— hunting and gathering —into modern times. Some scholars now argue, however, that there is evidence of the early practice of both agriculture and aquaculture by Aboriginal peoples.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-tools-did-the-aborigines-use>What kind of tools did the Aborigines use?</h2>
<p>The Aborigine occupation of Australia presents a series of puzzles, starting with the nature of their stone tools. The early stone tools found in Australia are much simpler than the Upper Paleolithic tools that appear in Europe at the same era.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-aboriginal-people-use-to-decorate-their-bodies>What did Aboriginal people use to decorate their bodies?</h2>
<p>Also common were carved wooden figures of mythic beings and contemporary persons; some were used in sacred ritual, others as memorial posts for the dead. ochre Ochre, traditionally used by Aboriginal Australian peoples to decorate objects, to create art, and in body decoration. Courtesy of AIATSIS (collection item no. 000125440)</p>
<h2 id=how-did-survival-international-help-the-aboriginal-people>How did Survival International help the Aboriginal people?</h2>
<p>Survival provided funds for some “homeland” projects, whereby Aboriginal people return from towns to their ancestral land. Survival also supported the campaign of the Mirarr people in the Northern Territory against a proposed uranium mine on their sacred land. This campaign succeeded in persuading the mining company not to go ahead.</p>
