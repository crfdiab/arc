<h2 id=why-is-japan-prone-to-earthquakes>Why is Japan prone to earthquakes?</h2>
<p>The Japanese archipelago is located in an area where several continental and oceanic plates meet, causing frequent earthquakes and the presence of many volcanoes and hot springs across Japan. If earthquakes occur below or close to the ocean, they may trigger tsunami.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-earthquakes-happen-in-japan>How often do earthquakes happen in Japan?</h2>
<p>The islands of Japan are located where four of the Earth’s tectonic plates converge. The country is also home to about ten percent of the world’s active volcanoes. This means that Japan experiences more earthquakes than just about anywhere else – around 1,500 per year.</p>
<h2 id=is-anywhere-in-japan-safe-from-tsunamis>Is anywhere in Japan safe from tsunamis?</h2>
<p>Sendai is the location of the 2011 tsunami, which was one of Japan’s most horrible natural disasters. The city itself is very safe, out of the 1 million people there were only 11,000 reported crimes.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-earthquakes-and-volcanoes-in-japan>Why are there so many earthquakes and volcanoes in Japan?</h2>
<p>Why is there so much earthshaking in Japan? Simply put, there is so much earthshaking in Japan because the Japanese islands are part of a volcanic island arc. As a quick reminder for those of you who are a little rusty on Geology 101, a volcanic island arc is a place where volcanoes are produced above a subduction zone.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-normal-to-have-an-earthquake-in-japan>Is it normal to have an earthquake in Japan?</h2>
<p>Earthquakes are something to expect at any time of the day in Japan, but don’t worry. Most modern Japanese buildings have earthquake-proof construction of cushioned pillars anchored in massive concrete foundations. It will ensure that you will get through unscathed during such an event in Japan.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-earthquake-in-japan-on-april-14>How big was the earthquake in Japan on April 14?</h2>
<p>The smaller 6.2-magnitude quake on Thursday (April 14) killed nine people and injured hundreds more, reported CBS News. For starters, Japan is located along the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, which is the most active earthquake belt in the world.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-kanto-earthquake-affect-japan>How did the Great Kanto earthquake affect Japan?</h2>
<p>If earthquakes occur below or close to the ocean, they may trigger tidal waves (tsunami). Many parts of the country have experienced devastating earthquakes and tidal waves in the past. The Great Kanto Earthquake, the worst in Japanese history, hit the Kanto plain around Tokyo in 1923 and resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 people.</p>
