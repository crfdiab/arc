<p>Alien and Sedition Acts, (1798), four internal security laws passed by the U.S. Congress, restricting aliens and curtailing the excesses of an unrestrained press, in anticipation of an expected war with France. After the XYZ Affair (1797), war with France had appeared inevitable.</p>
<h2 id=what-best-describes-the-alien-and-sedition-acts>What best describes the Alien and Sedition Acts?</h2>
<p>Which of these BEST describes the purpose of the Alien and Sedition Acts? They prevented people from becoming citizens of the United States. They provided a means to safely protect the country from French invasion. They were meant to punish the Federalists who supported the National Bank.</p>

<p>Alien and Sedition Acts. The Alien and Sedition Acts were a series of four laws passed by the U.S. Congress in 1798 amid widespread fear that war with France was imminent.
