<p>6 Simple Reasons the Union Won the Civil War</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing capacity. When it comes to actually fighting, there are some essentials that an army needs to be backed by — chief among them is the weapons of war.</li>
<li>Economics. Cotton awaiting transport in Arkansas.</li>
<li>Naval strength.</li>
<li>Ground transport.</li>
<li>Population.</li>
<li>Politics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-did-the-north-think-they-would-win-the-civil-war>Why did the North think they would win the Civil War?</h2>
<p>The North even had a richer, more varied agriculture than the South. The Union had a larger navy, blocking all efforts from the Confederacy to trade with Europe. Lee’s offensive war strategy had a high cost in casualties, destroying a large part of the Confederate army.</p>
<h2 id=what-advantages-did-the-union-have-in-winning-the-civil-war>What advantages did the union have in winning the Civil War?</h2>
<p>The Union had many advantages over the Confederacy. The North had a larg- er population than the South. The Union also had an industrial economy, where- as the Confederacy had an economy based on agriculture. The Union had most of the natural resources, like coal, iron, and gold, and also a well-developed rail system.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-confederacy-think-they-could-win-the-american-war>Why did the Confederacy think they could win the American War?</h2>
<p>Additionally, the Union states had a manpower advantage of 5 to 2 at the start of the war. What documented evidence exists which indicates the political, industrial, infrastructure, economical, military, and/or other significant factors considered favorable to the Confederacy as reasons for having confidence in a victory over the Union?</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-union-do-in-the-civil-war>What did the Union do in the Civil War?</h2>
<p>One of the first things the Union did was implement a naval blockade of Southern ports to keep supplies from getting to the Confederate Army while keeping that valuable Southern cotton from making it to foreign ports.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-south-win-the-civil-war>Why did the south win the Civil War?</h2>
<p>When all is well, the South’s cotton-based economy was booming due to worldwide demand for the crop. The trouble was that the population density in the South was so low that much of the wealth of the United States (and the banks that go along with that money) were overwhelmingly located in the North.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-cause-of-the-civil-war>What was the main cause of the Civil War?</h2>
<p>MAJOR CAUSES OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR I. Introduction to Civil War The American Civil War was a war within the United States of America fought by the North (Union) and the South (Confederacy) starting from 1861 and ending in 1865. This war was one of the most devastating events in American history, consuming more than 600,000 lives.</p>
