<h2 id=how-does-abiotic-and-biotic-factors-affect-an-ecosystem>How does abiotic and biotic factors affect an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Biotic factors are all of the living organisms within an ecosystem. These may be plants, animals, fungi, and any other living things. Abiotic factors are all of the non-living things in an ecosystem. If one factor is removed or changed, it can affect the entire ecosystem and all of the organisms that live there.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-biotic-factors-affect-the-ecosystem>How does biotic factors affect the ecosystem?</h2>
<p>The biotic factors in an ecosystem are the living organisms, such as animals. These living organisms affect each other and influence the health of the ecosystem. A healthy ecosystem has a balance of biotic examples; a large increase or decrease in population of one species can impact many others.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-relationship-between-biotic-and-abiotic>What are the relationship between biotic and abiotic?</h2>
<p>Introduction In ecology and biology, abiotic components are non-living chemical and physical factors in the environment which affect ecosystems. Biotic describes a living component of an ecosystem; for example organisms, such as plants and animals. Examples Water, light, wind, soil, humidity, minerals, gases.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-five-biotic-factors-in-an-ecosystem>What are five biotic factors in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Like all ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems have five biotic or living factors: producers, consumers, herbivores, carnivores, omnivores, and decomposers.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-biotic-and-abiotic-factors-of-an-ecosystem>What are the biotic and abiotic factors of an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Biotic and abiotic factors are all the living and non-living components of an ecosystem. Biotic factors include not only living things but interactions between organisms, such as predation …</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-non-living-factor-in-an-ecosystem>Which is a non living factor in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Abiotic Factors . Abiotic factors are the non-living components of the ecosystem, including its chemical and physical factors. Abiotic factors influence other abiotic factors.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-abiotic-components-originate-in-the-hydrosphere>Where do abiotic components originate in the hydrosphere?</h2>
<p>Abiotic components originate from the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere Discover more about Abiotic and Biotic factors, their meaning, the difference between abiotic and biotic resources and other related topics only at BYJU’S Biology</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-biotic-resource>Which is an example of a biotic resource?</h2>
<p>Examples of biotic resources include all the living components present in an ecosystem. These include producers, consumers, decomposers and detritivores. The term abiotic refers to all the non-living factors present in an ecosystem.</p>
