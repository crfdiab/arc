<p>Producers<br>
Producers, also known as autotrophs, make their own food. They make up the first level of every food chain. Autotrophs are usually plants or one-celled organisms.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-order-of-the-food-chain>What is the order of the food chain?</h2>
<p>Trophic levels are the order the organism is placed on the food chain. These levels are divided into producers (first), consumers (second, third and fourth) and decomposers (fifth). their own source of energy.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-food-chains-start-with>What do food chains start with?</h2>
<p>A food chain always starts with a producer. This is an organism that makes its own food. Most food chains start with a green plant, because plants can make their food by photosynthesis. A living thing that eats other plants and animals is called a consumer.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-5-levels-of-the-food-chain>What are the 5 levels of the food chain?</h2>
<p>Here are the five trophic levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Plants (producers)</li>
<li>Level 2: Animals that eat plants or herbivores (primary consumers)</li>
<li>Level 3: Animals that eat herbivores (secondary consumers, carnivores)</li>
<li>Level 4: Animals that eat carnivores (tertiary consumers, carnivores)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-cant-a-food-chain-starts-with-a-human-being>Why can’t a food chain starts with a human being?</h2>
<p>Food chains cannot start with human beings because we do not make our energy.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-5th-consumer-called>What is a 5th consumer called?</h2>
<p>The fifth trophic level contains organisms known as Quaternary consumers or Apex predators. These organisms consume organisms in the consumer levels below them and have no predators. They are at the top of the food chain..</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-food-chain-of-living-things-work>How does the food chain of living things work?</h2>
<p>The food chain of living things. Animals get their energy from food. Herbivores, like deer and hare, feed on plants. Carnivores, like lions and wolves, eat meat. Omnivores, which include pigs, bears, and humans, eat both plants and animals.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-living-thing-a-non-living-thing>What makes a living thing a non living thing?</h2>
<p>Have students help brainstorm the characteristics of each group and what makes a living thing living. All plants and animals are living because they can grow and reproduce, need food, water, and air, move and respond or adapt to their environment. Evaluation Ask students whether they think a river is living or not and discuss why it is non-living.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-first-stage-in-the-food-chain>Which is the first stage in the food chain?</h2>
<p>Every level in a food chain is known as a trophic level. The food chain consists of four major parts, namely: The Sun: The sun is the initial source of energy, which provides energy for everything on the planet. Producers: The producers in a food chain include all green plants. This is the first stage in a food chain.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-producer-in-the-food-chain>Which is an example of a producer in the food chain?</h2>
<p>Producers are also known as autotrophs as they make their own food. Producers are any plant or other organisms that produce their own nutrients through photosynthesis. For example, green plants, fruits, phytoplanktons, small plants, and algae are some examples of producers in a food chain.</p>
