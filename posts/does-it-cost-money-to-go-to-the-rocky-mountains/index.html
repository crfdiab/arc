<h2 id=does-it-cost-money-to-go-to-the-rocky-mountains>Does it cost money to go to the Rocky Mountains?</h2>
<p>Rocky Mountain National Park is unique in that it offers a Day Pass. Rocky will continue to offer the Day Pass, it will increase from $20 to $25. The Seven-Day Vehicle Pass will increase from $30 to $35, the Seven-Day Motorcycle Pass will increase from $25 to $30. The park’s Annual Pass will increase from $60 to $70.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-need-a-ticket-to-get-into-rocky-mountain-national-park>Do I need a ticket to get into Rocky Mountain National Park?</h2>
<p>An entrance pass is always required to enter Rocky Mountain National Park. All passes are available at all staffed park entrance stations.</p>
<h2 id=is-rocky-mountain-national-park-free-before-6am>Is Rocky Mountain National Park free before 6am?</h2>
<p>A timed entry permit is required to enter ALL areas of Rocky Mountain National Park—including Trail Ridge Road (US Hwy 34)—when arriving by vehicle between the hours of 6 am and 5 pm whether a visitor parks within the park or outside the park boundary. – You may enter at any time during your permit’s two-hour block.</p>
<h2 id=where-should-i-stay-when-visiting-the-rocky-mountains>Where should I stay when visiting the Rocky Mountains?</h2>
<p>So where to stay in Rocky Mountain? Your best bets are its two gateway towns—Estes Park to the east and Grand Lake to the west. Both offer plenty of options, and it’s simple enough to commute from the towns into the heart of the park.</p>
<h2 id=how-early-can-you-enter-rocky-mountain-national-park>How early can you enter Rocky Mountain National Park?</h2>
<p>Anyone entering the park between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. will need a permit.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-into-rocky-mountain-national-park>How much does it cost to get into Rocky Mountain National Park?</h2>
<p>All passes are available at all park entrance stations. 1-Day Pass – Automobile – $25.00 7-Day Pass – Automobile – $35.00 7-Day Pass – Per Person – $20.00 7-Day Pass – Motorcycle – $30.00 1-Day Pass – Per Person – $15.00 1-Day Pass – Motorcycle – $25.00</p>
<h2 id=can-you-go-to-rocky-mountain-national-park-in-one-day>Can you go to Rocky Mountain National Park in one day?</h2>
<p>Trying to see everything there is to see in Rocky Mountain National Park in one day would frankly be impossible. There are dozens of mountain peaks with 156 lakes strewn in between, all of them protected by National Park status from any unwanted development and damage.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-need-a-rocky-mountain-pass>When do you need a rocky mountain pass?</h2>
<p>From May 28 through October 11, 2021, visitors to Rocky Mountain National will need a timed entry permit and an entrance pass to recreate in the park.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-shuttle-to-rocky-mountain-national-park>Is there a shuttle to Rocky Mountain National Park?</h2>
<p>However, the shuttle bus stops only at a couple of trailheads, and misses some of the park’s key attractions. That is why visiting Rocky Mountain National Park with a private vehicle is the go-to option for most sightseers. Estes Park is a good place for coffee or breakfast before visiting Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
