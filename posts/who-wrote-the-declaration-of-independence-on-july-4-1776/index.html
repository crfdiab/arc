<h2 id=who-wrote-the-declaration-of-independence-on-july-4-1776>Who wrote the Declaration of Independence on July 4 1776?</h2>
<p>Thomas Jefferson’s<br>
Written in June 1776, Thomas Jefferson’s draft of the Declaration of Independence, included eighty-six changes made later by John Adams (1735–1826), Benjamin Franklin 1706–1790), other members of the committee appointed to draft the document, and by Congress.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-written-on-july-4th-1776>What was written on July 4th 1776?</h2>
<p>the Declaration of Independence<br>
On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, announcing the colonies’ separation from Great Britain.</p>
<h2 id=did-john-adams-sign-the-declaration-of-independence>Did John Adams sign the Declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>It was there that he was the first to propose a continental congress. In 1776, as a delegate to the Continental Congress, he signed the Declaration of Independence. Adams retired from the Congress in 1781 and returned to Massachusetts to become a leading member of that state’s convention to form a constitution.</p>
<h2 id=is-july-4-the-real-independence-day>Is July 4 the real Independence Day?</h2>

<h2 id=when-did-the-declaration-of-independence-get-signed>When did the declaration of Independence get signed?</h2>
<p>On July 4, 1786, he wrote: “There is much Rejoicing in Town today, it being the Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, which we sign’d that day Ten Years and thereby hazarded Lives and Fortunes.” [4] So was there a July 4th signing or not?</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-author-of-the-declaration-of-independence>Who was the author of the declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>Recall that the Federalist Papers’ three authors all signed as “Publius,” and that the Constitution claimed authorship by “We, the People.” Self-promotion was a 19th-century innovation. Jefferson and Adams would famously reconcile in their last years. Both died on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration. Talk about a coup de théâtre!</p>
