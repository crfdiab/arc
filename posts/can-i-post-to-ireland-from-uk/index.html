<p>This is something you can do whilst you are visiting Cobh in Cork. Interestingly enough, this island was used as a prison for petty crimes up until 2004, so you can take a day trip over and explore the remains of the prison and learn about its history. Boats leave hourly from 10 am to 2 pm and you’ll probably need 2-3 hours on the island.</p>

<p>Natural cork is an amazing resource made from sustainably harvested tree bark. They don’t even need to cut down the tree, they just pull off the bark and then it grows back like a sheep’s wool. So, being natural and wood-like, cork should break down in the compost pile, right?</p>
