<h2 id=when-was-the-observatory-invented>When was the observatory invented?</h2>
<p>The true predecessors of the modern observatory were those established in the Islamic world. Observatories were built at Damascus and Baghdad as early as the 9th–10th century ce. A splendid one was built at Marāgheh (now in Iran) about 1260 ce, and substantial modifications in Ptolemaic astronomy were introduced there.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-observatory-built-in-the-americas>Where was the first observatory built in the Americas?</h2>
<p>Peru<br>
Built in Peru in the fourth century B.C., the Thirteen Towers at Chankillo are the oldest solar observatory in the Americas. A fortified stone temple stands near the ancient towers. The towers’ builders predated the Incas by almost 2,000 years.</p>
<h2 id=does-nasa-have-an-observatory>Does NASA have an observatory?</h2>
<p>NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) is the most sophisticated x-ray observatory ever built. It observes x-rays from high-energy regions of the universe, such as hot gas in the remnants of exploded stars.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-highest-observatory-in-the-world>Where is the highest observatory in the world?</h2>
<p>University of Tokyo Atacama Observatory<br>
The highest astronomical observatory is the University of Tokyo Atacama Observatory, located at an altitude of 5,640 m (18,503 ft) on the summit of Cerro Chajnantor in a scientific reserve called Atacama Astronomical Park, Chile.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-founder-of-mount-wilson-observatory>Who was the founder of Mount Wilson Observatory?</h2>
<p>This feat, equivalent to measuring the size of a dime forty miles away, was achieved at Mount Wilson in 1920, almost a hundred years ago. George Ellery Hale, the founder of the Observatory, invited physicist Albert Michelson to use the 100-inch Telescope for the effort.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-palomar-mountain-observatory-in-california-open>Is the Palomar Mountain Observatory in California Open?</h2>
<p>The observatory is owned and operated by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). You can visit the telescope and small museum if they’re open. Check the website for hours and information.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-famous-observatory-in-the-world>Which is the most famous observatory in the world?</h2>
<p>For the first half of the 20th Century, Mount Wilson was the most famous observatory in the world. The biggest telescopes were here, and their new designs were changing the way astronomy was done.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-james-webb-telescope-coming-to-ut>When is the James Webb telescope coming to UT?</h2>
<p>UT astronomers are set to lead some of the largest programs in the first year of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, including the largest project overall. Set to launch this Halloween, the telescope will become operational by mid-2022.</p>
