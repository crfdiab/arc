<h2 id=why-is-middle-east-and-north-africa-an-important-region-in-world>Why is Middle East and North Africa an important region in world?</h2>
<p>The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region includes approximately 19 countries, according to World Atlas. The region has vast oil, petroleum, and natural gas reserves. Due to these reserves, MENA is an important source of global economic resources.</p>
<h2 id=what-the-middle-east-and-north-africa-have-in-common>What the Middle East and North Africa have in common?</h2>
<p>The Middle East and North Africa are two regions that are often grouped together because they have many things in common. Islam is the dominant religion in the area and almost everyone speaks Arabic. Most of the Middle East and North Africa is composed of desert land where very little rain falls.</p>
<h2 id=why-oil-in-the-middle-east-has-helped-the-economy>Why oil in the Middle East has helped the economy?</h2>
<p>Economic Growth and Decline As oil prices rose to new highs, most states in the Middle East benefited from heightened revenues. Oil-producing states (especially large producers such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar) benefited directly in the form of high export earnings.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-contributed-greatly-to-the-economic-growth-of-africa>Which country has contributed greatly to the economic growth of Africa?</h2>
<p>Trade has driven much of the growth in Africa’s economy in the early 21st century. China and India are increasingly important trade partners; 12.5% of Africa’s exports are to China, and 4% are to India, which accounts for 5% of China’s imports and 8% of India’s.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-11-countries-in-north-africa>What are the 11 countries in North Africa?</h2>
<p>Some sources, however, equate North Africa to the Maghreb region which includes Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and Morocco. The Arabs considered it the western part of the Arab world….Countries of North Africa.</p>

<h2 id=how-is-natural-gas-used-in-the-world>How is natural gas used in the world?</h2>
<p>Natural gas consumption in the non-OECD region grows by an average of 2.5%/year from 2012 to 2040, compared with 1.1%/year in the OECD countries. As a result, non-OECD countries account for 76% of the total world increment in natural gas consumption, and their share of world natural gas use grows from 52% in 2012 to 62% in 2040.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-natural-gas-used-in-southern-africa>How is natural gas used in southern Africa?</h2>
<p>The fraction of gas converted in southern Africa to derivatives (such as liquid fuels, wax, ammonia and methanol) is very high when compared to global ratios. Conversely the use of gas in electricity generation and industrial uses is very low compared to the rest of the world.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-majority-of-natural-gas-consumption-come-from>Where does the majority of natural gas consumption come from?</h2>
<p>in natural gas consumption is projected for the countries of non-OECD Asia, where economic growth leads to increased demand. Natural gas consumption in the non-OECD region grows by an average of 2.5%/year from 2012 to 2040, compared with 1.1%/year in the OECD countries.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-algeria-get-its-natural-gas-from>Where does Algeria get its natural gas from?</h2>
<p>Algeria energy export is salient to the country’s national economy as the country exports large volumes of natural gas to Europe. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ranks Algeria as the 16th largest oil reserves in the world and the second-largest in Africa.</p>
