<h2 id=who-was-the-real-william-tell>Who was the real William Tell?</h2>
<p>To recap that legend: William Tell was a farmer from Burglen who was visiting the neighboring village of Altdorf one day early in the 14th Century. There, he encountered Gessler, the Austrian bailiff who represented the authority of the ruling Hapsburgs.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-william-tell-shot-an-apple-off-his-sons-head>Why did William Tell shot an apple off his son’s head?</h2>
<p>The Danish legend of Palnatoki, first attested in the twelfth-century Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus, is the earliest known parallel to the Tell legend. As with William Tell, Palnatoki is forced by the ruler (in this case King Harald Bluetooth) to shoot an apple off his son’s head as proof of his marksmanship.</p>
<h2 id=was-william-tell-robin-hood>Was William Tell Robin Hood?</h2>
<p>The story of William Tell successfully shooting the apple from his son’s head, riposting Austrian occupiers and subsequently steering an uprising of free Swiss peasants to independence, has long been regarded by historians as on the same level of myth-history as the legend of Robin Hood.</p>
<h2 id=who-shot-an-arrow-off-his-sons-head>Who shot an arrow off his son’s head?</h2>
<p>William Tell<br>
Seven hundred years ago, William Tell shot an arrow through an apple on his son’s head and launched the struggle for Swiss independence.</p>
<h2 id=who-had-the-apple-on-their-head>Who had the apple on their head?</h2>
<p>Legend has it that a young Isaac Newton was sitting under an apple tree when he was bonked on the head by a falling piece of fruit, a 17th-century “aha moment” that prompted him to suddenly come up with his law of gravity. In reality, things didn’t go down quite like that.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-william-tell-and-what-did-he-do>Who is William Tell and what did he do?</h2>
<p>William Tell is a Swiss folk hero best known for child endangerment. Tell allegedly lived in Switzerland during the early 14th century, when the Hapsburg dynasty of Austria ruled the land. As the story goes, an Austrian official placed a hat on a pole in city of Altdorf and commanded every Swiss subject to remove their caps as they passed by it.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-brave-men-in-william-tells-story>Who are the brave men in William Tell’s story?</h2>
<p>Speaking of courage, that reminds us of another story about three very brave men named Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego who also faced a very cruel king, follow us to their story by clicking here. William’s son showed great faith in his father! He trusted his father to shoot the apple and not him! WOW! Click here to listen.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-tyrant-in-the-story-of-william-tell>Who was the tyrant in the story of William Tell?</h2>
<p>Many years ago a proud tyrant, whose name was Gessler, ruled over them, and made their lot a bitter one indeed. One day this tyrant set up a tall pole in the public square, and put his own cap on the top of it; and then he gave orders that every man who came into the town should bow down before it.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-real-william-tell-in-victorian-opera>Who was the real William Tell in Victorian Opera?</h2>
<p>While William Tell might have not been an actual person, there is no doubt that the legend is not only intrinsic to Swiss identity but has been an inspiration to freedom fighters around the world. His courage in fighting against oppression remains pertinent to this day. Victorian Opera performed William Tell as part of Season 2018.</p>
