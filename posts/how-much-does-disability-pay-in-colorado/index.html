<h2 id=what-states-offer-temporary-disability-benefits>What states offer temporary disability benefits?</h2>
<p>The states that have some type of short-term disability program are California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. Though similar, the rules on eligiblity for these programs and how they operate vary greatly between states.</p>
<h2 id=what-qualifies-for-disability-in-colorado>What qualifies for disability in Colorado?</h2>
<p>You must have a medically diagnosed disabling condition that prevents you from doing gainful work and that is expected to last for a long time or indefinitely. In the application, you must provide the names of your doctors and medical records detailing your medical disability and its effects on your life and job.</p>
<h2 id=what-conditions-fall-under-short-term-disability>What conditions fall under short-term disability?</h2>
<p>To qualify for short-term disability benefits, an employee must be unable to do their job, as deemed by a medical professional. Medical conditions that prevent an employee from working for several weeks to months, such as pregnancy, surgery rehabilitation, or severe illness, can qualify to receive benefits.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-disability-in-colorado>How long does it take to get disability in Colorado?</h2>
<p>In Colorado, the average time it takes to process an initial application for disability averages about 73 days in Colorado, and appeals can add extra months to the process. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a disability benefit based on financial need to cover basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-survive-while-waiting-for-disability-approval>How do you survive while waiting for disability approval?</h2>
<p>While you wait for disability benefits to be approved, consider seeking assistance through other local, state, and federal support programs. These may include: Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-state-disability-and-short-term-disability>What is the difference between state disability and short-term disability?</h2>
<p>The Basics Short-Term Disability (STD) is private insurance that replaces some of your income if an injury or illness prevents you from working. While you are away from work, it pays you a certain percentage of your income for a set period of time. It is called State Disability Insurance (SDI).</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-dont-return-to-work-after-short-term-disability>What happens if you don’t return to work after short term disability?</h2>
<p>Under some policies, if you cannot return to your “own occupation,” you can receive a monthly long-term disability benefit — even if you return to work with a different role. Depending on your policy, you might be able to receive a full LTD benefit or a residual benefit.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-short-term-disability-to-be-approved>How long does it take for short term disability to be approved?</h2>
<p>Most claims must be decided within 30-45 days, though in some cases the insurance company is allowed to take longer (for instance, if they are waiting for copies of your medical records or want to schedule an in-person examination).</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-short-term-disability-pay-in-colorado>How much does short term disability pay in Colorado?</h2>
<p>The State provides most benefit-eligible employees with Short-Term Disability (STD) Insurance which pays up to 60% of your weekly pre-disability covered compensation, up to a maximum STD weekly benefit payment of $3,000 per week, for up to 150 days during any 12 month period, following the required STD elimination period which is 30 calendar days.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-social-security-disability-work-in-colorado>How does Social Security disability work in Colorado?</h2>
<p>The state of Colorado administers the federal Social Security disability insurance program on behalf of residents. By law, each person must fund the premiums through mandatory payroll (FICA) taxes. Therefore, the coverage is involuntary and does not require extra steps to enroll.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-have-disability-insurance-in-colorado>Do you have to have disability insurance in Colorado?</h2>
<p>Because Colorado does not require state short-term disability insurance, many people find themselves in a financial pinch when they are unable to work. Private companies and the state government provide limited options for financial assistance.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-company-offer-a-short-term-disability-plan>Can a company offer a short term disability plan?</h2>
<p>Your employer might offer you a short-term disability plan as a benefit. However, the vast majority of the time, companies aren’t required to. In fact, there are only five states (California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island) where it’s mandated that employers offer a short-term disability plan to their employees.</p>
