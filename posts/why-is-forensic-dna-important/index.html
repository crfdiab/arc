<h2 id=why-is-forensic-dna-important>Why is forensic DNA important?</h2>
<p>Forensic DNA testing is a powerful tool used to identify, convict, and exonerate individuals charged of criminal offenses, but there are different views on its benefits and risks. Knowledge about public views on forensic DNA testing applied in the criminal field is socially valuable to practitioners and policymakers.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-dna-analysis-so-important>Why is DNA analysis so important?</h2>
<p>In all, DNA technology is increasingly vital to ensuring accuracy and fairness in the criminal justice system. In cases where a suspect has not yet been identified, biological evidence from the crime scene can be analyzed and compared to offender profiles in DNA databases to help identify the perpetrator.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-biotechnology-used-in-forensic>How is biotechnology used in forensic?</h2>
<p>Biotechnology is used by forensic scientists to collect or process trace evidence such as hair, skin, blood or semen samples, which is found at crime scenes. An important aspect of modern forensics is the use of DNA profiling, or genetic fingerprinting. The chemical structure of everyone’s DNA is the same.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-future-of-dna-in-forensic-science>What is the future of DNA in forensic science?</h2>
<p>The future of higher amounts of information in forensic DNA involves improved detection sensitivity, higher information content from expanded sets of core STR loci and possibly supplemental genetic markers, and deeper information from sequence analysis of alleles.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-dna-analysis-used-in-forensic-science>How is DNA analysis used in forensic science?</h2>
<p>Forensic scientists can use DNA profiles to identify criminals or determine parentage. A DNA profile is like a genetic fingerprint. Every person has a unique DNA profile, making it very useful for identifying people involved in a crime. Find out more in the article DNA profiling.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-dna>What is the importance of DNA?</h2>
<p>DNA contains the instructions needed for an organism to develop, survive and reproduce. To carry out these functions, DNA sequences must be converted into messages that can be used to produce proteins, which are the complex molecules that do most of the work in our bodies.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-used-in-dna-fingerprinting>What is used in DNA fingerprinting?</h2>
<p>DNA fingerprinting is a laboratory technique used to establish a link between biological evidence and a suspect in a criminal investigation. A DNA sample taken from a crime scene is compared with a DNA sample from a suspect. If the two DNA profiles are a match, then the evidence came from that suspect.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-dna-profiling-work-in-forensic-cases>How does DNA profiling work in forensic cases?</h2>
<p>Once forensic scientists obtain a sample, they extract the DNA from cells in bodily fluids or tissues and copy it. They then separate the copied markers using a process known as capillary electrophoresis. This enables them to identify distinct markers and the number of repeats for different markers in each allele.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-dna-fingerprinting>What are the pros and cons of DNA fingerprinting?</h2>
<p>List of Pros of DNA Fingerprinting</p>
<ul>
<li>It is simple, less intrusive testing.</li>
<li>It can reduce innocent convictions.</li>
<li>It can help solve crimes and identity issues.</li>
<li>It can be a violation of one’s privacy.</li>
<li>It raises concerns over third-party access.</li>
<li>It can be used the wrong way to convict innocents.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-5-other-uses-of-dna-fingerprinting>What are 5 other uses of DNA fingerprinting?</h2>
<p>Terms in this set (37)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>establish paternity and parentage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify victims of war and large scale disasters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>study biodiversity of species.</p>

<h2 id=settle-immigration-disputes-what-are-the-three-types-of-dna-analysis>settle immigration disputes. What are the three types of DNA analysis?</h2>
<p>There are three main types of DNA tests on the market: Y-chromosome (or Y-DNA), mitochondrial (or mtDNA), and autosomal. Each test produces different information. Ancestry® offers only the autosomal DNA test, which produces the most comprehensive snapshot of one’s ethnicity and living relatives.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-dna-forensics-in-biotech>What is the role of DNA forensics in biotech?</h2>
<p>4) DNA forensics is also used to identify the endangered species. By this technique these species can be protected from extinction. 5) DNA forensics allows the matching of the organ with the person who needs transplantation of that particular organ.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-dna-analysis>What do you need to know about DNA analysis?</h2>
<p>Like other forensic disciplines, a forensic DNA analysis is a comparative process requiring profiles from the questioned as well as known source. The identification process can not advance until the forensic DNA analyst has both components available for evaluation.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-reports-on-forensic-dna-analysis>Are there any reports on forensic DNA analysis?</h2>
<p>As described in Appendix 2, there have been two National Research Council (NRC) reports written on forensic DNA analysis: (NRC I) “DNA Technology in Forensic Science” published in 1992 and (NRC II) “The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence” released in 1996. An examination of their discussions on DNA mixture interpretation is instructive.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-return-on-investment-of-forensic-dna>What’s the return on investment of forensic DNA?</h2>
<p>A calculation is provided to demonstrate the large positive return on investment in forensic DNA infrastructure. With so large a cost benefit of providing a rapid forensic response to develop and eliminate suspects, a ‘forensic fire-station’ model is proposed to ensure maximization of cost savings and public safety.</p>
