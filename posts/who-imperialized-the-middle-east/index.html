<h2 id=who-imperialized-the-middle-east>Who Imperialized the Middle East?</h2>
<p>World War I transformed the Middle East in ways it had not seen for centuries. The Europeans, who had colonized much of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, completed the takeover with the territories of Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. The modern boundaries of the Middle East emerged from the war.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-middle-east-imperialized>Why was the Middle East Imperialized?</h2>
<p>The Causes, Ideology, and Theories of Imperialism Scholars attribute this imperial expansion to several impulses; the primary factors were the desire to control markets or natural resources and European continental rivalries extended to denial of lands to a rival.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-4-major-countries-involved-in-imperialism>Who were the 4 major countries involved in imperialism?</h2>
<p>Britain , France , Germany , Russia , and the Netherlands continued to colonize during this era, but they also devised other ways to spread their empires. In the late 19th century Japan and the United States joined the European nations as an imperialist power.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-resisted-imperialism-in-the-middle-east>How did people resisted imperialism in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Growing European imperialism gave rise to anti-imperialist sentiments that were vented in popular opposition to concessions, as in the Tobacco Revolt in Iran in 1891 and in the mobilization of political action around religious symbols and leaders (e.g., in Libya, where the Sanusi Sufi brotherhood spear-headed …</p>
<h2 id=did-british-rule-middle-east>Did British rule Middle East?</h2>
<p>British involvement in the region long antedated World War I, but Britain’s “moment” in the Middle East, as it has been called—the period in which it was the dominant power in much of the area—lasted from 1914 to 1956. The axis of Britain’s Middle Eastern empire stretched from the Suez Canal to the Persian Gulf.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-middle-east-become-a-region-of-asia>When did the Middle East become a region of Asia?</h2>
<p>During this series, Sir Ignatius expanded the definition of Middle East to include “those regions of Asia which extend to the borders of India or command the approaches to India.” After the series ended in 1903, The Times removed quotation marks from subsequent uses of the term.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-countries-in-the-greater-middle-east>Who are the countries in the Greater Middle East?</h2>
<p>The Greater Middle East was a political term coined by the second Bush administration in the first decade of the 21st century, to denote various countries, pertaining to the Muslim world, specifically Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-british-military-in-the-middle-east>Where was the British military in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>In the late 1930s, the British established the Middle East Command, which was based in Cairo, for its military forces in the region. After that time, the term “Middle East” gained broader usage in Europe and the United States, with the Middle East Institute founded in Washington, D.C. in 1946, among other usage.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-correct-translation-of-middle-east>Which is the correct translation of Middle East?</h2>
<p>Even though the term originated in the West, apart from Arabic, other languages of countries of the Middle East also use a translation of it. The Persian equivalent for Middle East is خاورمیانه (Khāvar-e miyāneh), the Hebrew is המזרח התיכון (hamizrach hatikhon) and the Turkish is Orta Doğu.</p>
