<h2 id=how-has-rome-influenced-the-united-states>How has Rome influenced the United States?</h2>

Similar to our modern world, the Romans held cultural events, built and stocked libraries, and provided health care. The government passed laws that protected its citizens.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-ancient-rome-influence-the-structure-of-the-united-states-government>How did Ancient Rome influence the structure of the United States government?</h2>
<p>Romans are also responsible for creating a legal code written down which protected the rights of all citizens. This document was influential in the creation of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution. The Roman Republic consisted of major political bodies including the Consuls, the Senate, and the Assemblies.</p>
<h2 id=what-3-ideas-did-america-get-from-rome>What 3 ideas did America get from Rome?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-romes-biggest-impact-on-the-united-states>What is Rome’s biggest impact on the United States?</h2>

<h2 id=where-can-you-find-the-influence-of-ancient-rome-in-our-world-today>Where can you find the influence of ancient Rome in our world today?</h2>
<p>Many aspects of today’s society have been affected by ancient Rome . Creation of law, development of democratic government practices, influences in language, literature, art, infrastructure, and city-planning are all areas where the influences of Roman ideas can be seen.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-we-still-use-today-from-the-romans>What do we still use today from the Romans?</h2>
<p>Roman sewers are the model for what we still use today. A Roman brick sewer. Aqueducts, gave the people of Rome water, and, from around 80 BC, sewers took the resulting waste away, often from another innovation, the public latrine.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-we-learn-from-the-romans>What did we learn from the Romans?</h2>
<p>Architecture. From military structures such as forts and walls (including the spectacular Hadrian’s Wall) to engineering feats such as baths and aqueducts, the most obvious impact of the Romans that can still be seen today is their buildings.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-romans-leave-behind-that-we-still-use-today>What did the Romans leave behind that we still use today?</h2>
<p>Roman sewers are the model for what we still use today. A Roman brick sewer. Aqueducts, gave the people of Rome water, and, from around 80 BC, sewers took the resulting waste away, often from another innovation, the public latrine. The first sewers were used to deal with floods rather than human waste.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-considered-romes-greatest-legacy>What is considered Rome’s greatest legacy?</h2>
<p>The statement that was considered Rome’s greatest legacy is “ideas about law.” Roman law has influenced many modern nations such as the United States. The Roma Assemblies were the figures that created laws in ancient Rome. Citizens formed the Assemblies and decided what laws to pass.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-romans-teach-us>What did the Romans teach us?</h2>
<p>Many of our buildings and how they are heated, the way we get rid of our sewage, the roads we use, some of our wild animals, religion, the words and language we speak, how we calculate distances, numbers and why we use money to pay for goods were all introduced by the Romans.</p>
<h2 id=how-roman-have-influenced-the-modern-world>How Roman have influenced the modern world?</h2>
<p>Roman Influences. Many aspects of today’s society have been affected by ancient Rome . Creation of law, development of democratic government practices, influences in language, literature, art, infrastructure, and city-planning are all areas where the influences of Roman ideas can be seen.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-the-romans-so-successful>How were the Romans so successful?</h2>
<p>The Roman Empire was so successful because of roman dominance in warfare and the stable structure of politics. The empire was impressive because the Romans were very practical and well organized people, they were ambitious and aggressive in obtaining anything the Romans craved.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-ancient-rome-influence-the-modern-world>How did ancient Rome influence the modern world?</h2>
<p>Elements of ancient Rome exist in our daily lives and are visible throughout our modern infrastructure, government, and culture. Similar to our modern world, the Romans held cultural events, built and stocked libraries, and provided health care.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-rome-have-a-presence-in-egypt>When did Rome have a presence in Egypt?</h2>
<p>Rome’s presence in Egypt actually predated both Julius Caesar and Octavian. The Romans had been involved periodically in Egyptian politics since the days of Ptolemy VI in the 2nd century BCE.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-ancient-egyptians-influence-the-modern-world>How did ancient Egyptians influence the modern world?</h2>
<p>Masons, skull and bones, and even Vatican has a lot of symbols of Egyptian Gods. Bush Sr. in the skull of bones had pyramids through out his house. …They also influenced horror movies about mummies and things that crawl beneath the desert. Yes, they gave us the Scorpion King. The heartless bastards! …Yes they did! Why isn’t beer on the list?</p>
<h2 id=why-was-architecture-important-to-the-ancient-egyptians>Why was architecture important to the ancient Egyptians?</h2>
<p>For this reason, both Egyptian art and architecture appear outwardly resistant to development and the exercise of individual artistic judgment, but Egyptian artisans of every historical period found different solutions for the conceptual challenges posed to them. Pyramids of Giza, Cairo, Egypt.</p>
