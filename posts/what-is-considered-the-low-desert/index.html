<h2 id=what-is-considered-the-low-desert>What is considered the low desert?</h2>
<p>The Low Desert is a common name for any desert in California that is under 2,000 feet (609.6 m) in altitude. These areas include, but are not exclusive to, the Colorado Desert and Yuha Desert, in the Southern California portion of the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-low-desert-in-arizona>What is the low desert in Arizona?</h2>
<p>In Arizona, local usage is: Low Desert = Phoenix, Yuma, Colo River towns (500 – 1500 ft elevation) Intermediate Desert = Tucson & vicinity (+/-2500 ft el) = Sonoran Desert Uplands.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-high-desert-a-desert>Is the high desert a desert?</h2>
<p>Contrary to its name, most of the high desert is not dry enough to truly qualify as desert, and biologically, most of the region is classified as scrubland or steppe. At 9,733 feet (2,967 m) above sea level, the summit of Steens Mountain is the highest point in the high desert.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-high-desert-and-low-desert>What is the difference between High Desert and low desert?</h2>
<p>The term “High Desert” serves to differentiate it from southern California’s Low Desert, which is defined by the differences in elevation, climate, animal life, and vegetation native to these regions. In contrast, Landers is considered “High Desert”, at 3,100 feet (940 m) above sea level.</p>

<h2 id=what-qualifies-as-high-desert>What qualifies as High Desert?</h2>
<p>High Desert is an informal designation, with non-discrete boundaries, applied to areas of the Mojave Desert in southern California that are generally between 2,000 feet (610 m) and 4,000 feet (1,200 m) in elevation, and located just north of the San Gabriel, San Bernardino and Little San Bernardino Mountains.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-lowest-elevation-in-the-mojave-desert>Which is the lowest elevation in the Mojave Desert?</h2>
<p>Higher elevations above 2,000 ft (610 m) in the Mojave are commonly referred to as the High Desert; however, Death Valley is the lowest elevation in North America at 280 ft (85 m) below sea level and is one of the Mojave Desert’s harshest climates and best known places.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-mojave-desert-the-driest-desert-in-the-world>Is the Mojave Desert the driest desert in the world?</h2>
<p>Originally settled by the Mohave Native Americans, it is considered to be the driest and smallest desert on the continent and is home to thousands of living plants and animals despite the limited water resources. The Mojave Desert is not your typical desert due to the wide variety of habitats and elevations that can be found in the area.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-low-deserts-in-the-united-states>Where are the low deserts in the United States?</h2>
<p>Low Desert. These areas include, but are not exclusive to, the Colorado Desert and Yuha Desert, in the Southern California portion of the Sonoran Desert. These areas are distinguished in biogeography from the adjacent northern High Desert or Mojave Desert by latitude, elevation, animal life, climate, and native plant communities.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-mojave-desert-get-its-name>How did the Mojave Desert get its name?</h2>
<p>The desert was named after the Indigenous Mojave Americans. The Mojave Desert is the smallest of the four deserts in America. The Mojave Desert is the smallest of the four deserts in America that altogether comprise the North American Desert.</p>
