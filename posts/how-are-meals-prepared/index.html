<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-prepare-a-meal>What’s the best way to prepare a meal?</h2>
<p>Meals for one: Prepare food and portion it in single-serving containers. (Usually enough to last a few days.) Ingredient prep: For people who like to cook and serve food all at once, just prep parts of recipes. Chop veggies, mix spices or marinade meat in advance to save time when you’re ready to cook. Why should you meal prep?</p>
<h2 id=how-to-prep-meals-for-the-week-on-8fit>How to prep meals for the week on 8fit?</h2>
<p>Simply sign up & download the 8fit app, go to the “Meals” tab and tap the shopping cart in the top left corner. 4. Prep meals for the week. Set aside time to prepare meals for the next 3-5 days. After you finish cooking and portioning your meals into your fancy storage containers, refrigerate or freeze your meals.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-to-prep-meals-ahead-of-time>How long to prep meals ahead of time?</h2>
<p>Pencil in prep time: Getting groceries ahead of time will allow you to prep meals that last you all week. Set aside 1-3 hours to do this prep work (depending on how many days you’re cooking for). We like to do our prep in batches. For example, we often prep 2-3 days of meals at a time.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-invest-in-for-meal-prep>What should I invest in for meal prep?</h2>
<p>Invest in high-quality food containers. When you start your meal prep journey, tupperware will be your new best friend. These handy containers will allow you to portion your healthy meals, take meals on the go, and become more environmentally friendly.</p>
