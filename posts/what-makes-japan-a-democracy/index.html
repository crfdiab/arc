<h2 id=what-makes-japan-a-democracy>What makes Japan a democracy?</h2>
<p>The politics of Japan are conducted in a framework of a multi-party bicameral parliamentary representative democratic constitutional monarchy in which the Emperor is the Head of State and the Prime Minister is the Head of Government and the Head of the Cabinet, which directs the executive branch.</p>
<h2 id=does-japan-have-freedom-of-speech>Does Japan have freedom of speech?</h2>
<p>Article 21 of Japan’s constitution prohibits censorship and protects freedom of “speech, press and all other forms of expression,” as well as the “secrecy of any means of communication.”82 In general, individuals and the media can exercise this in practice, though social and legal constraints exist.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-views-of-democracy-in-japan>What are the views of democracy in Japan?</h2>
<p>Views of Japanese democracy In the past decade and a half, while satisfaction with the economy has increased, public approval of Japanese democracy has declined, with many Japanese of the opinion that it is characterized by corruption and inattentiveness and that elections are ineffective.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-japan-become-a-democracy-after-world-war-2>How did Japan become a democracy after World War 2?</h2>
<p>Western influences led to liberal ideas finding their way in the Japanese mindset. All this led way to democratic practices in the governing system of modern Japan circa 1945, in the post-war times. After adopting the Constitution in 1947, Japan became a ‘ Full Democracy ‘ on paper.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-head-of-government-in-japan>Who is the head of government in Japan?</h2>
<p>Japan is a democracy, but according to the Democracy Index, it is a ‘flawed democracy’. The Government is a constitutional monarchy with the Emperor of Japan as a nominal head with limited authority. The Cabinet formed by the Prime Ministers has the executive powers to run the country.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-system-of-government-does-japan-have>What kind of system of government does Japan have?</h2>
<p>Japan is considered a constitutional monarchy with a system of civil law . The Economist Intelligence Unit rated Japan a ” flawed democracy ” in 2019. The Imperial Palace in Tokyo has been the primary residence of the Emperor since 1869. The Constitution of Japan defines the Emperor to be “the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people”.</p>
