<p>180 men<br>
What is Francisco Pizarro best known for? In 1531 Francisco Pizarro’s expedition of 180 men and 37 horses sailed to the Inca empire in Peru. A Spanish priest met with the Inca emperor Atahuallpa, exhorting him to accept Christianity and Charles V.</p>
<h2 id=did-francisco-pizarro-conquer-anyone>Did Francisco Pizarro conquer anyone?</h2>
<p>Conquering Peru and Death Pizarro was to conquer the southern territory and establish a new Spanish province there. In 1532, accompanied by his brothers, Pizarro overthrew the Inca leader Atahualpa and conquered Peru. Three years later, he founded the new capital city of Lima.</p>

<p>the Incas<br>
Francisco Pizarro was an explorer, soldier and conquistador best known for conquering the Incas and executing their leader, Atahuapla. He was born around 1474 in Trujillo, Spain. As a soldier, he served on the 1513 expedition of Vasco Núñez de Balboa, during which he discovered the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-pizarro-take-over-the-inca-empire>How did Pizarro take over the Inca Empire?</h2>
<p>Pizarro’s men massacre the Incans and capture Atahualpa, forcing him to convert to Christianity before eventually killing him. Pizarro’s timing for conquest was perfect. By 1532, the Inca Empire was embroiled in a civil war that had decimated the population and divided the people’s loyalties.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-francisco-pizarro-open-fire-on-the-incans>When did Francisco Pizarro open fire on the Incans?</h2>
<p>On 16 November 1532, Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish explorer and conquistador, springs a trap on the Incan emperor, Atahualpa. With fewer than 200 men against several thousand, Pizarro lures Atahualpa to a feast in the emperor’s honour and then opens fire on the unarmed Incans.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-did-pizarro-have-in-his-army>How many people did Pizarro have in his army?</h2>
<p>Pizarro had only about 180 men, but he also had the advantage of firearms, cannon, and horses. Atahualpa had thousands of Incan warriors with him. Pizarro’s secretary, Francisco de Xeres wrote about the approach of Atahualpa.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-spanish-conqueror-of-the-inca-empire>Who was the Spanish conqueror of the Inca Empire?</h2>
<p>Francisco Pizarro, Spanish conqueror of the Inca empire and founder of the city of Lima. Pizarro is best known for expeditions to South America, beginning in 1523, his conquest of the Inca Empire by defeating a 30,000-strong Inca force with fewer than 200 troops, and his capture of the emperor, Atahuallpa.</p>
