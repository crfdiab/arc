<p>The First Five-year Plan was launched in 1951 which mainly focused in the development of the primary sector. The First Five-Year Plan was based on the Harrod–Domar model with few modifications. The most important feature of this phase was active role of state in all economic sectors.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru<br>

<p>The Five-Year Plans were laid to rest by the Narendra Modi-led NDA government in 2015. Hence, the 12th five-year plan is considered the last five-year plan of India. The decades-old Five-Year Plans was replaced by a three-year action plan, which will be part of a seven-year strategy paper and a 15-year vision document.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-focus-of-indias-five-year-plan>What was the main focus of India’s Five-Year Plan?</h2>
<p>First Five-Year Plan in India With the Partition as backdrop, the country reeling with the influx of refugees, severe food shortage and mounting inflation, the First Five-Year Plan was introduced in 1951. It focused primarily on the development of the primary sector, specifically agriculture and irrigation.</p>

<p>In China, the first Five-Year Plan (1953–57) stressed rapid industrial development, with Soviet assistance; it proved highly successful.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-five-year-plan-in-india>What was the purpose of five year plan in India?</h2>
<p>The idea was to plan public spending for equitable growth rather than leaving expenditure to the market forces. The Five-Year Plans played a great role in lifting India’s social sector and building of heavy industry. A centralised planning system could ensure that the money gets spent where it was the most needed.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-growth-rate-of-the-twelfth-five-year-plan-in-india>What was the growth rate of the Twelfth Five Year Plan in India?</h2>
<p>The Twelfth Five-Year Plan of the Government of India has been decided to achieve a growth rate of 8.2% but the National Development Council (NDC) on 27 December 2012 approved a growth rate of 8% for the Twelfth Plan.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-objective-of-the-tenth-five-year-plan>What was the objective of the Tenth Five Year Plan?</h2>
<p>Tenth Plan (2002–2007) The main objectives of the Tenth Five-Year Plan: Attain 8% GDP growth per year. Reduction of poverty rate by 5% by 2007. Providing gainful and high-quality employment at least to the addition to the labour force. Reduction in gender gaps in literacy and wage rates by at least 50% by 2007.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-president-of-the-five-year-plan>Who was the first president of the five year plan?</h2>
<p>Five-Year Plans (FYPs) were centralised economic and social growth programs. Joseph Stalin, president of the erstwhile USSR, implemented the first Five-Year Plan in the late 1920s. India too followed the socialist path but here the planning was not as comprehensive since the country had both public and private sectors.</p>
