<h2 id=why-do-people-botellon>Why do people Botellon?</h2>
<p>Botellón (pronounced [boteˈʎon]; Spanish for “big bottle”) is a Spanish activity when people congregate in public areas to socialize while drinking alcohol. Botellón is not an alternative to typical nightlife, but is rather an economical way to drink with people before going out to bars, discos, or clubs.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-alcohol-affect-a-teenage-body>How does alcohol affect a teenage body?</h2>
<p>Young people are at greater risk of alcohol-related harm than adults. As the brain keeps developing into the mid-twenties, drinking alcohol as a teenager can greatly increase the risk of damage to the developing brain. It can also lead to problems with alcohol later in life.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-alcohol-use-affect-growth-and-development-during-adolescence>How can alcohol use affect growth and development during adolescence?</h2>
<p>› Drinking alcohol during the teenage years can cause permanent brain damage. Damage to the brain could be responsible for memory problems, inability to learn, problems with verbal skills, alcohol dependence and depression. › Alcohol can affect a teenager’s social development if they start drinking at an early age.</p>

<p>Spain<br>
Botellón is a deep-rooted cultural phenomenon in Spain that refers to people gathering in the street to socialise and drink alcohol. It could be translated as ‘pre-drinking’ but in some cases, people, often students, will just go to a park or plaza to drink with no intention of going anywhere else afterwards.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-ok-for-a-14-year-old-to-drink-alcohol>Is it OK for a 14 year old to drink alcohol?</h2>
<p>Drinking may cause youth to have trouble in school or with the law. Drinking alcohol also is associated with the use of other substances. Research shows that people who start drinking before the age of 15 are at a higher risk for developing alcohol use disorder later in life.</p>
<h2 id=how-alcohol-affects-the-frontal-lobe>How alcohol affects the frontal lobe?</h2>
<p>In studies, alcoholics have exhibited brain shrinkage and deficiencies in the white brain matter that carries information between cells. Brain scans of heavy drinkers indicate that alcohol negatively affects neurotransmission, brain cell metabolism, and blood flow within the frontal lobes and cerebellum.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-drinking-age-21-science-behind>Why is the drinking age 21 science behind?</h2>
<p>In short, we ended up with a national minimum age of 21 because of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. This law basically told states that they had to enact a minimum drinking age of 21 or lose up to 10 percent of their federal highway funding.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-drink-on-the-street-spain>Can you drink on the street Spain?</h2>
<p>The Spanish government is to ban drinking of alcohol in the street and the sale of alcoholic drinks to people aged under 18. The custom is popular because alcoholic drinks in Spain are cheaper than in many other EU countries and because the climate is warmer than in many parts of Europe.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-drink-botellon-in-northern-europe>Why do people drink Botellon in northern Europe?</h2>
<p>Evidence of this imported culture may lie in the predominant botellón beverages – mixed drinks – something more traditionally seen in colder northern European countries. The reason why botellón now exists at such a large scale could be because of mobile phones and social networks.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-drink-botellon-in-spain>Is it illegal to drink Botellon in Spain?</h2>
<p>Botellón is a favourite pastime in action, but it’s seriously testing the innate Spanish tolerance for noise and is causing friction across all of society. Before reading about Madrid’s buzzing botellón sites, it’s important to understand that many of them are illegal and are an area of controversy.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-el-nino-on-the-environment>What are the effects of El Nino on the environment?</h2>
<p>The dramatic effects of El Niño can be seen in marine and aquatic life, in agriculture and in the quality of our water supplies. Condition: Effect: warmer sea temperatures. plankton and fish kills in coastal waters. lower sea levels. exposure of underwater, fragile coral reefs. higher sea levels.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-botellon-held-in-spain>Where was the first Botellon held in Spain?</h2>
<p>There’s one on the grounds of the Complutense University, which in 2006 hosted Madrid’s macro botellón event – a flash-mob of street drinkers who wanted to protest against the restrictions on drinking in the street.</p>
