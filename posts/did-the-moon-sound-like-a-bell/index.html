<h2 id=did-the-moon-sound-like-a-bell>Did the Moon sound like a bell?</h2>
<p>Though the Apollo lunar modules were built for the sole purpose of landing two men on the surface of the Moon, their usefulness didn’t end after ascending from the lunar surface. These crashes caused moonquakes, and scientists measured the vibrations moving through the Moon and found it rings like a bell.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-moon-ring-rare>Is a moon ring rare?</h2>
<p>Weather lore says a lunar halo is the precursor of impending unsettled weather, especially during the winter months. This is often proved true, as cirrus and cirrostratus clouds generally precede rain and storm systems. Lunar halos are, in fact, actually fairly common.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-the-ring-around-the-moon>What causes the ring around the Moon?</h2>
<p>Bottom line: Halos around the sun or moon are caused by high, thin cirrus clouds drifting high above your head. Tiny ice crystals in Earth’s atmosphere create the halos. They do it by refracting and reflecting the light. Lunar halos are signs that storms are nearby.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-earth-ring-like-a-bell>Does the Earth ring like a bell?</h2>
<p>The Earth’s entire atmosphere vibrates like a giant bell, with various large-scale resonant waves travelling in both directions around the globe. However, despite considerable subsequent work, their presence of Laplace’s waves had remained undetected. …</p>
<h2 id=does-the-earth-really-ring-like-a-bell-after-a-big-earthquake>Does the earth really ring like a bell after a big earthquake?</h2>
<p>Seismic waves from the biggest earthquakes (over magnitude 8.3) can bounce around inside the earth for up to a month. This makes the earth “ring”. However, you need special instruments to hear the ring because the tone is very low — about 1 cycle per hour.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-earth-ring-like-a-bell>When did the Earth ring like a bell?</h2>
<p>2001<br>
continuous signals,” a University of California researcher recounted in 2001. These seismic waves ranged from 2 to 7 millihertz – thousands of times lower than the human hearing range – and continued endlessly, regardless of earthquakes. The phenomenon became popularly known as the “hum of the Earth.”</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-sometimes-see-a-ring-around-the-moon>Why do we sometimes see a ring around the Moon?</h2>
<p>This ring surrounding the Moon is caused by the refraction of Moonlight (which is really reflected sunlight, of course) through ice crystals suspended in the upper atmosphere between 5-10 km in altitude.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-for-the-moon-to-have-its-own-moon>Is it possible for the Moon to have its own Moon?</h2>
<p>Yes, it is possible for a moon to itself have moons and/or rings, and there are a few places where scientists have suggested that this is (or was) the case.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-moons-that-have-moonlets-or-rings>Are there any moons that have moonlets or rings?</h2>
<p>So the answer is a definite YES, in theory, moons can have moonlets, and even rings! None are known for sure yet, but there is a distinct possibility that Rhea at least might still, some day, be proved to have a tiny moonlet or even a sparse ring system.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-ice-crystals-on-the-moon>Where are the ice crystals on the Moon?</h2>
<p>These are located on either side of the lunar ring, parallel to the horizon. In certain conditions, especially in the Arctic, where the ice crystals can be close to the surface, you can get a moon pillar.</p>
