<h2 id=is-the-california-condor-prehistoric>Is the California condor prehistoric?</h2>
<p>A holdover from prehistoric times, the great condor is one of our largest and most magnificent birds — and one of the rarest. The captive breeding program turned out to be surprisingly successful, and flocks of released condors are surviving in several areas of California and in the region of the Grand Canyon.</p>
<h2 id=can-the-california-condor-fly>Can the California condor fly?</h2>
<p>A California Condor in flight is an impressive sight. With a nine-foot plus wingspan, the birds can stay aloft for hours, floating up to 15,000 feet on warm air thermals. This is North America’s largest flying bird, weighing over 20 pounds.</p>
<h2 id=what-killed-the-california-condor>What killed the California condor?</h2>
<p>Lead poisoning<br>
Lead poisoning from spent ammunition is the number one cause of death among adult California condors in the wild. Condors also pick up and feed their young small objects left behind by humans, such as pieces of glass and metal, and have been known to accidentally drink poison like antifreeze.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-see-california-condors>Where can you see California condors?</h2>
<p>Where to see condors in the wild</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitter Creek National Wildlife Refuge, Kern County.</li>
<li>Mt.</li>
<li>Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge, Fillmore area.</li>
<li>Pinnacles National Park, south of San Jose.</li>
<li>Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=who-is-bigger-condor-or-eagle>Who is bigger Condor or eagle?</h2>
<p>Although the condor weighs about twice as much as an eagle, the superior talons of the eagle command respect. Condors can survive 1–2 weeks without eating.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-condor-in-the-world>What is the biggest condor in the world?</h2>
<p>Andean condor<br>
Found in the Andes mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, the Andean condor is the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight and wingspan.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-bigger-condor-or-eagle>Which is bigger condor or eagle?</h2>
<h2 id=how-do-i-identify-a-california-condor>How do I identify a California condor?</h2>
<p>Adults are black with striking white patches under the wings. The naked head and neck are yellowish orange. Immatures have dark heads, grayer necks, and mottled grayish instead of clear white patches under the wings. Adult coloration is reached at 6-8 years of age.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-bigger-condor-or-eagle-1>Who is bigger Condor or Eagle?</h2>
<h2 id=is-the-california-condor-an-endangered-species-in-the-wild>Is the California condor an endangered species in the wild?</h2>
<p>The California condor is protected by the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Condor 780 came from an egg laid at the World Center Birds of Prey in Boise, Idaho and was fostered in the wild by condors in a monitored nest in Southern California.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-condors-found-in-the-united-states>Where are condors found in the United States?</h2>
<p>California Condors have been reintroduced to mountains of southern and central California, Arizona, Utah, and Baja California.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-wingspan-of-a-california-condor>How big is The wingspan of a California condor?</h2>
<p>Considered one of the rarest birds in the world, it is the largest land bird in North America with a wingspan up to 9 1/2 feet and weighing up to 23 pounds. California condors have a wingspan of 9.5 feet (3 meters)- at least 2 feet longer than the next largest bird in the region (the golden eagle).</p>
<h2 id=what-do-california-condors-do-in-their-flight>What do California condors do in their flight?</h2>
<p>Helpless, covered in white down with eyes open. California Condors can cover hundreds of miles in one flight as they soar for hours at a time, looking for carrion. These long-distance travelers pair off during the breeding season but are highly social at roosting, bathing, and feeding sites; individuals recognize one another.</p>
