<h2 id=where-did-jacques-cartier-live-as-a-child>Where did Jacques Cartier live as a child?</h2>
<p>Childhood & Early Life Jacques Cartier was born on December 31, 1491 in Saint-Malo, the port on the north-west coast of Brittany. It is not known how he learned the art of navigation though it is generally accepted that he accompanied Giovanni da Verrazzano on unofficial explorations initiated by the king of France in 1524.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-jacques-cartier-cross-the-atlantic-again>When did Jacques Cartier cross the Atlantic again?</h2>
<p>Cartier once again crossed the Atlantic in 1541. He explored further and found what he thought were gold and diamonds. When he returned to France in 1542, he was told that they were just common minerals. After his third voyage Cartier never returned to North America. He died near Saint-Malo, his birthplace, on September 1, 1557.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-jacques-cartier-find-the-saint-lawrence-river>Where did Jacques Cartier find the Saint Lawrence River?</h2>
<p>Instead he found the Saint Lawrence River, which became France’s main route into Canada. Jacques Cartier was born in 1491 in Brittany, a province of France. In about 1534, the king of France asked him to lead an expedition to North America.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-jacques-cartier-discover-prince-edward-island>Where did Jacques Cartier discover Prince Edward Island?</h2>
<p>He discovered Prince Edward Island on his first voyage, and impressed by his exploratory skills, the king sent him on other voyages in future during the course of which he explored, and claimed the modern-day Canada for France. Jacques Cartier was born on December 31, 1491 in Saint-Malo, the port on the north-west coast of Brittany.</p>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-challenges-did-jacques-cartier-face>What kind of challenges did Jacques Cartier face?</h2>
<p>Cartier also had lots of challenges. Such as the time when his companions had gotten scurvy during one of his voyages. The scurvy had killed 25 of his crew members. Also on his second voyage, he had taken hostages, Donnaconna (the chief), 4 children, two sons of Donnacona that had gone to France previously,…</p>
<h2 id=how-did-jacques-cartier-learn-the-art-of-navigation>How did Jacques Cartier learn the art of navigation?</h2>
<p>It is not known how he learned the art of navigation though it is generally accepted that he accompanied Giovanni da Verrazzano on unofficial explorations initiated by the king of France in 1524. Cartier was introduced to King Francis I by Jean le Veneur, bishop of Saint-Malo and abbot of Mont-Saint-Michel, in 1534.</p>

<h2 id=when-did-jacques-cartier-and-catherine-des-granches-get-married>When did Jacques Cartier and Catherine des Granches get married?</h2>
<p>Jacques Cartier married Catherine Des Granches in May 1520, but they had no children. In 1534 the King of France commissioned Jacques Cartier to “discover certain islands and lands where it is said there is a large amount of gold and other riches to be found.”</p>

<h2 id=who-are-the-family-members-of-alfred-cartier>Who are the family members of Alfred Cartier?</h2>
<p>The Baumes – Frère Baume – of Baume et Mercier were a close-knit bunch of Swiss watchmakers from a village in the Jura mountains. The crown jewellers, Garrard & Co, were a family business for almost 150 years; Asprey, similarly. But none had a succession plan quite like Alfred Cartier.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-jacques-cartier-and-the-iroquois>What was the relationship between Jacques Cartier and the Iroquois?</h2>
<p>Several of Cartier’s men succumbed to diseases during the winter and to make matters worse, the cordial relations between the explorers and the natives became strained. When spring set in and the rivers began to melt, Cartier captured some of the Iroquois chiefs and sailed for France.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-importance-of-the-cartier-expedition-of-1535>What was the importance of the Cartier expedition of 1535?</h2>
<p>The expedition of 1535 was more important than the first expedition and included 110 people and three medium-sized ships – the Grande Hermine [the Great Stoat], the Petite Hermine [the Lesser Stoat] and the Émérillon [the Merlin] – which had been adapted for river navigation.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-jacques-cartiers-third-voyage-a-failure>Why was Jacques Cartier’s third voyage a failure?</h2>
<p>Jacques Cartier’s third voyage was largely a failure Following a war in Europe, King Francis I wanted to claim Canada as a colony and was in direct competition with Spain for the land. He sent out a third voyage to the country in 1541, this time led by Jean-François de La Rocque de Roberval. Jacques Cartier was then appointed subaltern to Roberval.</p>
