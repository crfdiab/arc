<h2 id=what-was-the-difference-between-the-values-of-the-athenians-and-the-spartans>What was the difference between the values of the Athenians and the Spartans?</h2>
<p>In addition, the two city-states also had different values. Spartans valued strength, duty and discipline while Athenians valued knowledge, arts and wisdom in battle.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-significant-difference-between-athens-and-sparta>What was the most significant difference between Athens and Sparta?</h2>
<p>The most significant difference between Athens and Sparta was that Athens worshipped many gods, while Sparta worshipped one. Athens had a strong army, while Sparta had a strong navy. Athens focused on citizenship, while Sparta focused on the military.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-of-the-ancient-spartans>What was the religion of the ancient Spartans?</h2>
<p>The ancient Spartans believed in religion and the gods like the majority of the ancient Greek states. Therefore the religion of Sparta was Polytheism, which means that the Spartans believed in not just one god, buy many gods.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-spartans-value-most>What did Spartans value most?</h2>
<p>The Spartans valued discipline, obedience, and courage above all else. Spartan men learned these values at an early age, when they were trained to be soldiers.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-bad-about-sparta>What is bad about Sparta?</h2>
<p>Spartans were renowned for their devotion to physical fitness and proper diet, and they reserved a special loathing for overweight citizens, who were publicly ridiculed and risked being banished from the city-state.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-athens-have-that-sparta-didn-t>What did Athens have that Sparta didn t?</h2>
<p>Athens and Sparta differed in their ideas of getting along with the rest of the Greek empires. Sparta seemed to be content with themselves and provided their army whenever required. Sparta had a powerful army and Athens knew that they could not beat them but they had the power of a naval unit which Sparta didn’t have.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-differences-between-sparta-and-athens>What are 3 differences between Sparta and Athens?</h2>
<p>The main difference between Athens and Sparta is their government, economy, and society. Athenian society, which was based on trade, valued art and culture and was ruled under a form of democracy. Spartan society, on the other hand, was a militant society whose economy was based on farming and conquering.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-spartans-believe-in-jesus>Did the Spartans believe in Jesus?</h2>
<p>Did the Spartans believe in Jesus? Ancient Spartans did believe in religion and the gods. The religion of Sparta was Polytheism, which means that the Spartans believed in not just one god, but many gods. Sparta’s love of fighting and physical excellence of course led them to favour some gods more than others.</p>
<h2 id=which-god-did-the-spartans-worship>Which God did the Spartans worship?</h2>
<p>Sparta worshipped Ares and Artemis Orthia as their patron deities. The Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia was one of the most important religious sites in Sparta. Three major festivals of Sparta namely Hyacinthia, Gymnopaedia and Carneia were celebrated in the honor of Apollo.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-values-of-a-spartan>What are the 3 values of a Spartan?</h2>
<h2 id=did-spartans-really-throw-babies-off-cliffs>Did Spartans really throw babies off cliffs?</h2>
<p>Spartans had to prove their fitness even as infants. The ancient historian Plutarch claimed these “ill-born” Spartan babies were tossed into a chasm at the foot of Mount Taygetus, but most historians now dismiss this as a myth. To test their constitutions, Spartan infants were often bathed in wine instead of water.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-difference-between-athens-and-sparta>What was the difference between Athens and Sparta?</h2>
<p>The two rival city-states of Athens and Sparta were both different in many ways. One of the main differences was their form of government. Although both city-states had elected assemblies, Sparta was ruled by two kings while Athens was rules by annually-elected archons.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-education-like-in-sparta-and-athens>What was the education like in Sparta and Athens?</h2>
<p>Spartan women were educated and could own and manage property, unlike Athenian women. In Athens, boys received a well-rounded education, but girls were only taught household chores. In Sparta, both boys and girls received physical training to stay fit. Spartan boys received a military education and training for many years.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-climate-like-in-sparta-and-athens>What was the climate like in Sparta and Athens?</h2>
<p>This eventually led to war between all the Greeks. Athens had a Mediterranean climate with great amount of precipitation, whereas Sparta had fairly temperate but very dry climate. Due to soil erosion and less vegetation, water was a very scanty commodity in Sparta.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-athenian-army-inferior-to-the-spartans>Why was the Athenian army inferior to the Spartans?</h2>
<p>While at certain stages, especially under Demosthenes, the Athenian army grew to a monumental strength, almost matching the Spartans, overall it was inferior. It was the navy of Athens which allowed it to dominate the alliances of Greek “poleis” (city states), as well as the seas.</p>
