<h2 id=what-did-jefferson-mean-by-the-statement-in-his-inaugural-address-we-are-all-federalists-we-are-all-republicans>What did Jefferson mean by the statement in his inaugural address we are all Federalists We are all Republicans?</h2>
<p>‘ He also insisted that ‘we are all republicans, we are all federalists,’ by which he meant that all Americans rejected monarchy and embraced republican government, and that all Americans agreed that the powers of government were well divided between the federal government and the states.”</p>
<h2 id=why-is-thomas-jeffersons-first-inaugural-address-important>Why is Thomas Jefferson’s first inaugural address important?</h2>
<p>But he was also the first president to use the inaugural address as an opportunity to declare “the essential principles” by which his administration would be governed, for neither Washington nor Adams used the inauguration to declare a new set of political principles.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-thomas-jefferson-mean-when-he-said-every-difference-of-opinion-is-not-a-difference-of-principle>What did Thomas Jefferson mean when he said every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle?</h2>
<p>Jefferson says “every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.” He compares “difference of opinion” and “difference of principle,” reminding his audience that they may have one without the other. They may differ in their opinion but that does not mean that their principles are different.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-theme-of-jeffersons-first-inaugural-address>What was the theme of Jefferson’s first inaugural address?</h2>
<p>The major theme is overcoming differences of opinion and uniting for the common good for the preservation of the principles of Democratic government, such as equal rights, and the reinforcement of peaceful civil relations through the rule of law.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-thomas-jefferson-say-about-politics>What did Thomas Jefferson say about politics?</h2>
<p>Jefferson’s most fundamental political belief was an “absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority.” Stemming from his deep optimism in human reason, Jefferson believed that the will of the people, expressed through elections, provided the most appropriate guidance for directing the republic’s course.</p>
<h2 id=did-thomas-jefferson-say-i-never-considered>Did Thomas Jefferson say I never considered?</h2>
<p>“I never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, as cause for withdrawing from a friend.” – Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-jeffersons-view-on-the-economy>What was Jefferson’s view on the economy?</h2>
<p>Thomas Jefferson’s view on the economy of the new United States was that the federal economy should be kept “rigorously frugal and simple.” He envisioned the states being able to run their own economies with minimal interference from Washington policy makers, and he opposed the establishment of a central bank.</p>
