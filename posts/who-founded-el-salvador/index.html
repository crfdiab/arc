<h2 id=who-founded-el-salvador>Who founded El Salvador?</h2>
<p>The Spanish conquest and colonization of El Salvador began in 1524 with the arrival of an expedition from Guatemala led by Pedro de Alvarado. Alvarado’s troops met determined opposition from a Nahua tribe, the Pipil, that occupied much of the region west of the Lempa River.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-el-salvador-before>What was El Salvador before?</h2>
<p>Cuzcatlan<br>
It was the Pipil, who called their land Cuzcatlan, who were dominating the region when the Spanish showed up some 400 years later. To this day the name Cuzcatlan is an alternate word to describe El Salvador.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-el-salvador-become-its-own-country>When did El Salvador become its own country?</h2>
<p>1839<br>
Manuel Jose Arce. El Salvador declared itself an independent republic in 1839, although the next several decades were marked by frequent revolutions.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-el-salvador-called-before-colonization>What was El Salvador called before colonization?</h2>
<p>Before the Spanish conquest, the area that is known as El Salvador was composed of three indigenous states and several principalities. In central El Salvador were the indigenous inhabitants, the Pipils, or the Pipiles, a tribe of the nomadic people of Nahua that were settled there for a long time.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-salvadorans-are-in-the-us>How many Salvadorans are in the US?</h2>
<p>As of 2010, there are 2,195,477 Salvadoran Americans in the United States, the fourth-largest Latino community by nation of ancestry. According to the Census Bureau, in 2016 Salvadorans made up 3.8% of the total Latino population in the US.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-richest-mexican-american>Who is the richest Mexican American?</h2>
<p>Carlos Slim<br>
In 2021, the Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim had a fortune of 62.8 billion U.S. dollars and was thus the richest Latin American that year, followed by Mexican businessman German Larrea, with a fortune of nearly 26 billion dollars.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-el-salvador-before-the-spanish>What was the history of El Salvador before the Spanish?</h2>
<p>The history of El Salvador begins with several Mesoamerican nations, especially the Cuzcatlecs, as well as the Lenca and Maya. In the early 16th century, the Spanish Empire conquered the territory, incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of New Spain ruled from Mexico City.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-el-salvador-become-an-independent-republic>When did El Salvador become an independent Republic?</h2>
<p>The problem of land distribution has been the source of many political conflicts in Salvadoran history. The Central American federation was dissolved in 1838 and El Salvador became an independent republic. El Salvador’s landed elite depended on production of a single export crop, indigo.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-el-salvador-located-in-central-america>Where is El Salvador located in Central America?</h2>
<p>Land El Salvador is bounded by Honduras to the north and east, by the Pacific Ocean to the south, and by Guatemala to the northwest. Its territory is situated wholly on the western side of the isthmus, and it is therefore the only Central American country that lacks a Caribbean coast.</p>

<p>El Salvador, country of Central America. El Salvador is the smallest and most densely populated of the seven Central American countries. Despite having little level land, it traditionally was an agricultural country, heavily dependent upon coffee exports. By the end of the 20th century, however, the service sector had come to dominate the economy.</p>
