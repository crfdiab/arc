<h2 id=how-did-mongols-affect-trade>How did Mongols affect trade?</h2>
<p>In China, for example, the Mongols increased the amount of paper money in circulation and guaranteed the value of that paper money in precious metals. They also built many roads — though this was only partly to promote trade — these roads were mainly used to facilitate the Mongols’ rule over China.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-mongols-encouraged-trade-during-the-pax-mongolica>How did the Mongols encouraged trade during the Pax Mongolica?</h2>
<p>The Mongols promoted peace and stability during the Pax Mongolica and wanted an empire that can prosper in trading. The Mongols created networks of trade routes all around Asia and Europe. They kept their trade routes safe for each occupied area, so the merchants and travelers were safe during their expeditions.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-mongols-get-from-trade>What did the Mongols get from trade?</h2>
<p>The resulting stability brought by Mongol rule opened these ancient trade routes to a largely undisturbed exchange of goods between peoples from Europe to East Asia. Along the Silk Road, people traded goods such as horses, porcelain, jewels, silk, paper, and gun powder.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-the-mongols-actually-a-positive-influence-on-trade>Why were the Mongols actually a positive influence on trade?</h2>
<p>Positive Effects of the Mongols Although the Mongol invasion of Europe sparked terror and disease, in the long run, it had enormous positive impacts. This peace allowed for the reopening of the Silk Road trading routes between China and Europe, increasing cultural exchange and wealth all along the trade paths.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-mongols-tax-trade>Did the Mongols tax trade?</h2>
<p>To facilitate trade, Genghis offered protection for merchants who began to come from east and west. Instead of extortionist tax rates, the Mongols gave traders tax exemption. Genghis offered a form of passport to merchants that gave allowed them to safely travel along the Silk Road.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-the-pax-mongolica-have-on-trade>What impact did the Pax Mongolica have on trade?</h2>
<p>As a result, the trade routes used by merchants became safe for travel, resulting in an overall growth and expansion of trade from China in the east to Britain in the west. Thus, the Pax Mongolica greatly influenced many civilizations in Eurasia during the 13th and 14th centuries.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-mongol-empire-impact-world-trade>How did the Mongol Empire Impact World Trade?</h2>
<p>How did the Mongols impact trade? To facilitate trade, Genghis offered protection for merchants who began to come from east and west. For the 100 years of the height of the Empire, the East-West Mongol trade routes became the fabled Silk Road which for the first time linked Europe to Asia, allowing the free flow of ideas, technologies and goods.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-silk-road-important-to-the-mongols>Why was the Silk Road important to the Mongols?</h2>
<p>The cause of this prosperity was the economic revitalization of Eurasia through increased trade and communication. With the region under the control of one military power that could protect trade routes from thieves and bandits, trade along land routes such as the Silk Road once again flourished.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-money-did-the-mongols-use>What kind of money did the Mongols use?</h2>
<p>The Mongols even loaned money at low interest to merchants. If paper money was used as currency, it was backed with silk and precious metals. As a result of the Mongol Empire, international Mongol trade was born on a level never seen before.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-mongols-bring-to-the-east>What did the Mongols bring to the east?</h2>
<p>Gold, medical manuscripts, astronomical tomes and porcelain headed east to Asia. Ideas and new technologies also flowed in both directions along the Silk Road. Mongols opened their doors to all religions and diplomats from all over the known world. East learned of West and visa versa.</p>
