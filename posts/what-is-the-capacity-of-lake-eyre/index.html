<p>60,000 people<br>
The Lake Eyre Basin is one of the largest and most pristine desert river systems on the planet, supporting 60,000 people and a wealth of wildlife. It’s a rarity in a world that has harnessed, tapped, pumped and dammed its rivers, sometimes, to death.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-much-water-in-lake-eyre>Is there much water in Lake Eyre?</h2>
<p>The water has reached Belt Bay (the deepest point of the Lake) and is now spilling over and spreading out. There is still a vast amount of water still making its way down the river system towards the Lake as well. The water has now reached Lake Eyre.</p>
<h2 id=does-lake-eyre-overflow>Does Lake Eyre overflow?</h2>
<p>Water flowing into Madigan Gulf is spread over such a large area it evaporates rapidly. In 1984 a rare occurrence saw Lake Eyre South not only fill but overflow through the Goyder Channel to fill Madigan Gulf and Belt Bay to ~3 metres!</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-lake-eyre-flood>How often does Lake Eyre flood?</h2>
<p>every three years<br>
Typically a 1.5 m (5 ft) flood occurs every three years, a 4 m (13 ft) flood every decade, and a fill or near fill a few times a century. The water in the lake soon evaporates, with a minor or medium flood drying by the end of the following summer.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-water-is-in-lake-eyre-south>How much water is in Lake Eyre south?</h2>
<p>Here’s what he had to say about it: How much water is in the lake? Water levels in Lake Eyre (North)/Kati Thanda peaked at about 65-70 per cent surface coverage in June but have been dropping, so it’s now at about 55 per cent coverage. Lake Eyre (South)/Kati Thanda remained dry during this flood event.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-lake-eyre-to-be-full>How long does it take for Lake Eyre to be full?</h2>
<p>It is estimated that these waters reach Lake Eyre roughly 8 years in 100. When the lake is full, a notable phenomenon is that around midday the surface can often become very flat. The surface then reflects the sky in a way that leaves both the horizon and water surface virtually impossible to see.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-lowest-point-in-lake-eyre>Where is the lowest point in Lake Eyre?</h2>
<p>Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre • Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre is located within the arid and semi-arid deserts of central Australia and contains the country’s lowest point (15.2 metres below sea level). • In most years, some water reaches the lake though the coverage is often quite low. When water does enter the lake most parts are only a few centimetres deep.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-lake-eyre-basin-in-australia>How big is the Lake Eyre Basin in Australia?</h2>
<p>The Lake Eyre basin (/ɛər/ AIR) is a drainage basin that covers just under one-sixth of all Australia.</p>
