<h2 id=what-was-the-first-new-zealand-flag>What was the first New Zealand Flag?</h2>
<p>the flag of the United Tribes<br>
New Zealand’s first official flag was the flag of the United Tribes. It was selected on 20 March 1834 by 25 chiefs from the Far North who, with their followers, had gathered at Waitangi in the Bay of Islands. Missionaries, settlers and the commanders of 13 ships were also present.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-colors-of-the-new-zealand-flag-stand-for>What do the colors of the New Zealand Flag stand for?</h2>
<p>On the flag’s fly, there is a pattern of stars representing the Southern Cross in the Crux constellation. The flag’s proportion is 1:2, with three colors: red, blue, and white. The 1902 flag is a symbol for the people of New Zealand, its Realm, and the Government. The color blue represents the sky and the sea.</p>
<h2 id=who-created-nz-flag>Who created NZ flag?</h2>
<p>Admiral Sir Albert Hastings Markham<br>
On the right half of the flag are four stars in the formation of the Southern Cross constellation. Each star is red with a white border, and has five points. Admiral Sir Albert Hastings Markham, KCB designed the New Zealand Flag.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-4-stars-on-nz-flag-represent>What do the 4 stars on NZ flag represent?</h2>
<p>The stars on the Flag represent the Southern Cross constellation, emphasising New Zealand’s location in the South Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-new-zealand-start-using-the-british-flag>When did New Zealand start using the British flag?</h2>
<p>After the formation of the colony in 1840, British ensigns began to be used. The current flag was designed and adopted for use on the colony’s ships in 1869, was quickly adopted as New Zealand’s national flag, and given statutory recognition in 1902.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-symbols-on-the-new-zealand-flag>What are the symbols on the New Zealand flag?</h2>
<p>The flag of New Zealand uses two prominent symbols: The Union Jack (or Union Flag) The Southern Cross (or Crux) In its original usage as the flag of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Union Jack combined three heraldic crosses which represent the countries of the United Kingdom (as constituted in 1801):</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-union-jack-flown-above-the-new-zealand-flag>Why was the Union Jack flown above the New Zealand flag?</h2>
<p>The Union Jack was described as the “superior flag”, to be flown above the New Zealand flag prior to 1965. During the Invasion of the Waikato (July 1863 – April 1864) period of the New Zealand Wars the Imperial British forces realised they needed access to colonial ships to fight Māori.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-new-zealand-flag-the-same-as-australias>Is the New Zealand flag the same as Australia’s?</h2>
<p>The New Zealand flag is often mistaken for the flag of Australia (pictured), since they are similar in design. With the Union Jack in its upper left-hand quarter, the flag still proclaims New Zealand’s origins as a British colony.</p>
