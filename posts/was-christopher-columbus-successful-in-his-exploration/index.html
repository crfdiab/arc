<h2 id=was-christopher-columbus-successful-in-his-exploration>Was Christopher Columbus successful in his exploration?</h2>
<p>From a Eurocentric point of view, he was the first to discover the Americas and thus as an explorer he was very successful. Columbus’s subsequent voyages would tarnish his early success as an explorer and he would prove inept to govern the islands that he had discovered.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-christopher-columbus-so-successful>Why was Christopher Columbus so successful?</h2>
<p>Columbus wanted to find a sea route to Asia by sailing across the Atlantic. He was not successful in his endeavor but ended up leading the first European expeditions to the Caribbean, Central America and South America. His voyages were beneficial for Europe and made possible the colonization of the Americas.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-christopher-columbus-accomplish-on-his-voyage>What did Christopher Columbus accomplish on his voyage?</h2>
<p>During his lifetime, Columbus led a total of four expeditions to the New World, discovering various Caribbean islands, the Gulf of Mexico, and the South and Central American mainland, but never accomplished his original goal—a western ocean route to the great cities of Asia.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-christopher-columbus-so-interested-in-exploration>Why was Christopher Columbus so interested in exploration?</h2>
<p>Christopher Columbus owned a copy of Marco Polo’s famous book, and it gave him a love for exploration. In the mid 15th century, Portugal was desperately trying to find a faster trade route to Asia.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-voyages-did-columbus-make-across-the-atlantic-ocean>How many voyages did Columbus make across the Atlantic Ocean?</h2>
<p>The explorer Christopher Columbus made four trips across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain: in 1492, 1493, 1498 and 1502.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-title-did-christopher-columbus-have>What kind of title did Christopher Columbus have?</h2>
<p>He held many important titles and positions during his lifetime. In 1492, Columbus received the title of “Almirante mayor del Mar Oceano” which translates to “Admiral of the Ocean”. Columbus had a legal agreement with the Spanish Crown that entitled him to a percentage of their profits from his discoveries.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-christopher-columbus-discover-the-new-world>When did Christopher Columbus discover the New World?</h2>
<p>Quick Facts: He is credited for discovering the Americas in 1492, although we know today people were there long before him; his real achievement was that he opened the door for more exploration to a New World. Name: Christopher Columbus [Kri-stə-fər] [Kə-luhm-bəs] Birth/Death: 1451 – 1506</p>
