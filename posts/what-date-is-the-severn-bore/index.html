<p>Severn Bore Predictions for 2021</p>

<h2 id=how-often-does-a-tidal-bore-occur>How often does a tidal bore occur?</h2>
<p>Tidal bores can occur every day, like the tidal bore of the Batang River in Malaysia, called the benak. Other tidal bores, like the pororoca, occur during spring tides. Spring tides happen during new moons and full moons, when tides are strongest. Tidal bores almost never occur during neap tides.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-best-place-to-see-the-severn-bore>Where is the best place to see the Severn Bore?</h2>
<p>The bore is best seen at two principal points: (i) Stonebench, on the south-east side of the river, three and a half miles by road from Gloucester Cross. In some respects this is best avoided due to the lanes becoming choked with vehicles of hopeful viewers.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-severn-bore-2020>What is the Severn Bore 2020?</h2>
<p>Taking place on numerous occasions every year, The Severn Bore is an impressive tidal wave of water which works its way up the Severn Estuary over a distance of around 25 miles between Awre and Gloucester – attracting hosts of spectators, and scores of extreme sports enthusiasts, along the way.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-severn-bore-happen-every-day>Does the Severn Bore happen every day?</h2>
<p>The largest bores occur around the times of the equinoxes but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. There are about 260 bores in each year occurring twice a day on 130 days.</p>
<h2 id=when-can-i-see-the-arnside-bore>When can I see the Arnside bore?</h2>
<p>March through September are considered the best times of the year to view the phenomenon. It typically occurs two hours before high tide.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-worlds-largest-tidal-bore>Where is the world’s largest tidal bore?</h2>
<p>Qiantang river<br>
The Qiantang river at Hangzhou in China has the largest tidal river bore in the world, which can be over 4 m high, 3 km wide, and travelling with a speed in excess of 24 km hr−1 (15 mph). At certain locations, reflected waves can reach 10 m in height, and its roar can be heard over an hour before its arrival.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-can-tidal-bores-get-in-size>How big can tidal bores get in size?</h2>
<p>Up to 2 meters (7 ft) and 20 km/h (12 mph). Historically, the Colorado River had a tidal bore up to 6 feet, that extended 47 miles up river. The Savannah River up to 10 miles (16 km) inland. Small tidal bores, only a few inches in height, have been observed advancing up tidal bayous on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-rivers-have-a-bore>How many rivers have a bore?</h2>
<p>100 rivers<br>
The onset of the flood tide is marked by a distinct and sometimes very vigorous wave called a bore. Approximately 100 rivers around the world are known to produce bores, of which perhaps 20 or so are in the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-times-a-year-does-the-severn-bore-happen>How many times a year does the Severn Bore happen?</h2>
<p>There are about 260 bores in each year occurring twice a day on 130 days. Because the bores are associated with the phases of the moon, one occurs between 7 a.m. and noon on bore days, and the other between 7 p.m. and midnight GMT, with the largest bores occurring between 9 and 11 in both the morning and evening.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-the-severn-bore-at-night>Can you see the Severn bore at night?</h2>
<p>The purpose of being there for a night time bore is to see the bore only by moonlight and to hear the eerie sound of the bore crashing through the trees on the banks as it races up river. Wherever you choose to view the bore (anywhere between Minsterworth and Over at Gloucester) arrive early and stay safe.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-before-high-tide-is-arnside-bore>How long before high tide is Arnside bore?</h2>
<p>two hours<br>
It typically occurs two hours before high tide.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-severn-bore-start-and-end>When does the Severn bore start and end?</h2>
<p>Below is the Severn Bore timetable for 2021 as provided by Arrowsmith. 2021. Towards the end of 2021 we will be creating the 2022 timetable so keep checking back! There are many places along the course of the river Severn to see the bore.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-was-the-largest-bore-in-the-severn-river>How tall was the largest bore in the Severn River?</h2>
<p>The largest recorded bore was on 15 October 1966, when it reached a height of 2.8 m (9.2 ft) at Stonebench. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen; viewers do not have to restrict themselves to these because most of the river banks and floodbanks are public footpaths.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-ride-the-severn-bore>Who was the first person to ride the Severn bore?</h2>
<p>The river was first surfed in 1955 by World War II veteran Jack Churchill, a Military Cross recipient renowned both for carrying a Scottish broadsword, and for being the only Allied soldier to kill an enemy with a longbow during the war. He became a surfing enthusiast in his later life and rode the bore on a board he designed himself.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-a-river-bore-in-the-uk>What causes a river bore in the UK?</h2>
<p>A river bore is caused by the tidal surge of the sea being funnelled up stream, around 60 rivers in the world have bores, 8 in UK. The shape of the river Severn and the fact it has the third highest tidal range in the world creates one of longest rideable waves in the world.</p>
