<h2 id=what-equipment-does-the-space-station-carry>What equipment does the space station carry?</h2>
<p>That includes food, clothing, mid-deck seats, flight tools, cameras, parachutes, safety equipment, sleep restraints and, most importantly, the astronaut spacesuits — known as “extravehicular mobility units.” Each spacesuit weighs over 200 pounds and is received in four pieces.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-needed-on-a-space-station>What is needed on a space station?</h2>
<p>Astronauts must have oxygen, food, water, and rest. These needs are usually simple to meet on Earth; to meet these needs in space is very complicated. The gases in space cannot support human life. In fact, most of space contains no gases at all—it is what scientists call a vacuum.</p>
<h2 id=what-supplies-are-sent-to-the-iss>What supplies are sent to the ISS?</h2>
<p>The Progress spacecraft is the most frequent cargo ship sent from Baikonur to the station, bringing supplies such as food, fuel, gas, experiments, and parts. Its light payload is offset by its ability to deliver critical replacement parts at short notice.</p>
<h2 id=what-gadgets-do-astronauts-use-in-space>What gadgets do astronauts use in space?</h2>
<p>11 Amazing Gadgets You’ll Find on the International Space Station</p>

<li>Zero-Gravity 3D Printer.</li>
<li>Robonaut.</li>
<li>Avian Development Facility (ADF)</li>
<li>Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED)</li>
<li>Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG)</li>
<li>Mobile Servicing System.</li>

<h2 id=how-does-the-iss-get-water>How does the ISS get water?</h2>
<p>The NASA water systems on the ISS collect moisture from breath and sweat, urine from people and research animals, and runoff from sinks and showers to keep the station hydrated. …</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-iss-get-electricity>How does the ISS get electricity?</h2>
<p>The ISS electrical system uses solar cells to directly convert sunlight to electricity. Large numbers of cells are assembled in arrays to produce high power levels. This method of harnessing solar power is called photovoltaics. The ISS power system uses radiators to dissipate the heat away from the spacecraft.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-vehicle-is-on-the-space-station>What kind of vehicle is on the Space Station?</h2>
<p>NASA is currently testing a CRV prototype called the X-38. Progress Cargo Vehicles – carry reboost propellant (up to 6,600 pounds) to the Space Station about four times per year. Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) – is a transfer vehicle to carry reboost propellant and supplies to the Space Station.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-weapons-on-the-international-space-station>Are there any weapons on the International Space Station?</h2>
<p>The spiky and serrated table knife among the Skylab II (SL-3) eating utensils surely can be used as a weapon. The famous multi functional pocket knife manufactured by Victorinox AG is among the everyday tools aboard the International Space Station. It has a very sharp blade, and it has been present on NASA missions since the late Seventies.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-people-wear-on-the-space-station>What do people wear on the Space Station?</h2>
<p>Workers and engineers wear full non-contaminant clothing while working. Modules receive cleaning and polishing, and some areas are temporarily disassembled for the installation of cables, electrical systems and plumbing.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-modules-are-on-the-space-station>What kind of modules are on the Space Station?</h2>
<p>The space station’s Tranquility module, known as Node 3, couldbe repurposed as the main living space for humans headed to a nearbyasteroid, NASA officials said. The node could be connected to two spaceexploration vehicles and have add-on inflatable modules.</p>
