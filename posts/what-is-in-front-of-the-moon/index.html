<h2 id=what-is-in-front-of-the-moon>What is in front of the Moon?</h2>
<p>The sun always lights up the half of the moon that faces toward it, and since the moon revolves around the earth about one every 29 and a half days, we get to see it at a little bit different angle each day.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-face-of-the-moon-called>What is the face of the Moon called?</h2>
<p>It is composed of craters and shadows on the Moon’s surface that, together, form an image resembling a face. The “Face on Mars” is a better known example of pareidolia.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-the-sun-is-in-front-of-the-moon>What is it called when the sun is in front of the Moon?</h2>
<p>As observed from the Earth, a solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes in front of the Sun. The type of solar eclipse event depends on the distance of the Moon from the Earth during the event.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-side-of-the-moon-that-is-facing-the-earth>Which is the side of the Moon that is facing the Earth?</h2>
<p>In the diagram above, you can see the Moon always has a lit side (facing the Sun) and a dark side (facing away from the Sun). From the Earth, we can only see the part of the Moon that is facing toward us at any time (which is often called the near side of the Moon) and we cannot see the part of the Moon facing away from Earth…</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-the-first-quarter-of-the-moon>What do you call the first quarter of the Moon?</h2>
<p>As the Moon moves eastward away from the Sun in the sky, we see a bit more of the sunlit side of the Moon each night. A few days after new moon, we see a thin crescent in the western evening sky. The crescent Moon waxes, or appears to grow fatter, each night. When half of the Moon’s disc is illuminated, we call it the first quarter moon.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-invisible-phase-of-the-moon>Which is the invisible phase of the Moon?</h2>
<p>New Moon This is the invisible phase of the Moon, with the illuminated side of the Moon facing the Sun and the night side facing Earth. In this phase, the Moon is in the same part of the sky as the Sun and rises and sets with the Sun. Not only is the illuminated side facing away from the Earth, it’s also up during the day!</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-the-far-side-of-the-moon-from-earth>Can you see the far side of the Moon from Earth?</h2>
<p>From the Earth, we can only see the part of the Moon that is facing toward us at any time (which is often called the near side of the Moon) and we cannot see the part of the Moon facing away from Earth (called the far side of the Moon).</p>
