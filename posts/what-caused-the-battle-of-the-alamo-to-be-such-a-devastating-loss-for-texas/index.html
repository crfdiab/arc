<h2 id=what-caused-the-battle-of-the-alamo-to-be-such-a-devastating-loss-for-texas>What caused the battle of the Alamo to be such a devastating loss for Texas?</h2>
<p>In the Mexican-American War, Mexico faced an enemy that was coming into its own as a military power. Mexico – which had easily won victory at the Alamo – soon faced an America that had annexed Texas and was becoming a major player on the world stage. …</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-as-a-result-of-the-siege-of-the-alamo-and-its-defenders>What happened as a result of the siege of the Alamo and its defenders?</h2>
<p>On March 6, 1836, after 13 days of intermittent fighting, the Battle of the Alamo comes to a gruesome end, capping off a pivotal moment in the Texas Revolution. Mexican forces were victorious in recapturing the fort, and nearly all of the roughly 200 Texan defenders—including frontiersman Davy Crockett—died.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-battle-of-the-alamo>What was the result of the Battle of the Alamo?</h2>
<p>First the Alamo was a battle fought, the second fact was the garrison was pretty much either killed in battle or executed afterwards. The third fact was Captain Travis did in fact write and dispatch the famous “Victory Or Death “ letter to all of Texas.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-highest-profile-defender-to-fall-at-the-alamo>Who was the highest profile defender to fall at the Alamo?</h2>
<p>Davy Crockett, a famous frontiersman and former US Congressman, was the highest-profile defender to fall at the Alamo. Crockett’s fate is unclear. According to some questionable eyewitness accounts, a handful of prisoners, including Crockett, were taken after the battle and put to death.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-black-slaves-that-survived-the-alamo>Are there any black slaves that survived the Alamo?</h2>
<p>Several black slaves also survived the battle, at least one of whom, a man named Joe, had fought in the Alamo’s defense. The image of Bowie fighting from his sickbed may also be pure legend. Some witnesses, including a woman who claimed to be his nurse, stated that he had been too ill to even raise his gun by that point.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-texan-general-who-won-the-alamo>Who was the Texan general who won the Alamo?</h2>
<p>Two months later, at San Jacinto, General Sam Houston led a Texan army against Mexican forces that outnumbered them nearly 2 to 1. The Texan fighters shouted, “Remember the Alamo!” as they fought their way to victory, earning independence for Texas.</p>
