<h2 id=what-is-the-typical-breakfast-in-ireland>What is the typical breakfast in Ireland?</h2>
<p>In Ireland, as elsewhere, the exact constituents of a full breakfast vary, depending on geographical area, personal taste and cultural affiliation. Traditionally, the most common ingredients in Ireland are bacon rashers, pork sausages, fried eggs (or scrambled), white pudding, black pudding, toast and fried tomato.</p>

<p>Travellers are advised to read the FCO travel advice at gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice for the country they are travelling to. From lamb in spring to fish in summer, stews and soups in winter and, of course, potatoes at almost any time of the year, Irish food involves simple, hearty, family cooking that follows the seasons.</p>
<h2 id=what-foods-did-the-irish-eat-during-the-famine>What foods did the Irish eat during the famine?</h2>
<p>Almost anything can be thrown into stew (a fact especially helpful during days of famine). In an Irish stew, the sauce is thick and hearty, usually made with cream. Potatoes, cabbage and other vegetables are simmered in the sauce. Meat (lamb, beef, pork) and seafood (salmon, lobster, mussels) are typically added to the mix.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-eat-on-st-patricks-day-in-ireland>What to eat on St Patrick’s Day in Ireland?</h2>
<p>For the most important meal of the day (sorry, breakfast), Irish people will traditionally satisfy their sweet tooth with a hot apple tart served with custard and cream, but a variety of cakes are served too.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-potatoes-do-they-eat-in-ireland>What kind of potatoes do they eat in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Colcannon is a classic, comforting mash of potatoes, cabbage (or kale) and butter (or cream), flavoured with spring onions. Champ is a similar, mashed potato favourite, flavoured with spring onions, milk and butter. Try making your own… Colcannon or champ made with mustard or celeriac. Want something a bit different?</p>
