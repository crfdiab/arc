<h2 id=who-was-the-us-president-who-proved-pythagorean-theorem>Who was the US president who proved Pythagorean Theorem?</h2>
<p>James Garfield<br>
James Garfield Was the Only U.S. President to Prove a Math Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem has been proved many times, and probably will be proven many more times.</p>
<h2 id=has-the-pythagorean-theorem-been-proven>Has the Pythagorean Theorem been proven?</h2>
<p>In its development, the Pythagorean Theorem has been proven by mathematicians with different methods. Based on historical developments there are approximately 200 proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem that has been found.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-pythagorean-theorem-proved>How was the Pythagorean Theorem proved?</h2>
<p>Pythagoras’ Proof By subtracting equals from equals, it now follows that the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the legs” (Eves 81). Consider the following figure. The area of the first square is given by (a+b)^2 or 4(1/2ab)+ a^2 + b^2.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-pythagoras-prove-the-pythagorean-theorem>When did Pythagoras prove the Pythagorean Theorem?</h2>
<p>Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean theorem was first known in ancient Babylon and Egypt (beginning about 1900 B.C.). The relationship was shown on a 4000 year old Babylonian tablet now known as Plimpton 322. However, the relationship was not widely publicized until Pythagoras stated it explicitly.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-triangles-are-proved-by-the-pythagorean-theorem>What type of triangles are proved by the Pythagorean Theorem?</h2>
<p>Apply the converse of Pythagorean Theorem. Since the square of the length of the longest side is the sum of the squares of the other two sides, by the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem, the triangle is a right triangle. A corollary to the theorem categorizes triangles in to acute, right, or obtuse.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-use-pythagorean-theorem-on-any-triangle>Can you use Pythagorean Theorem on any triangle?</h2>
<p>Pythagoras’ theorem only works for right-angled triangles, so you can use it to test whether a triangle has a right angle or not.</p>
<h2 id=is-pythagorean-theorem-only-for-right-triangles>Is Pythagorean theorem only for right triangles?</h2>
<p>The hypotenuse is the longest side and it’s always opposite the right angle. Pythagoras’ theorem only works for right-angled triangles, so you can use it to test whether a triangle has a right angle or not.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-triangle-proves-the-pythagorean-theorem>What type of triangle proves the Pythagorean Theorem?</h2>
<p>right triangle<br>
The Pythagorean equation relates the sides of a right triangle in a simple way, so that if the lengths of any two sides are known the length of the third side can be found. Another corollary of the theorem is that in any right triangle, the hypotenuse is greater than any one of the other sides, but less than their sum.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-pythagorean-apply-to-all-triangles>Does the Pythagorean apply to all triangles?</h2>
<h2 id=how-can-you-tell-if-a-triangle-is-a-right-triangle-using-pythagorean>How can you tell if a triangle is a right triangle using Pythagorean?</h2>
<p>The converse of the Pythagorean Theorem is: If the square of the length of the longest side of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the triangle is a right triangle.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-president-garfield-come-up-with-the-pythagorean-theorem>How did President Garfield come up with the Pythagorean theorem?</h2>
<p>He discovered this proog five years before he become President. He hit upon this proof in 1876 during a mathematics discussion with some of the members of Congress. It was later published in the New England Journal of Education.. The proof depends on calcultaing the area of a right trapezoid two different ways.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-proof-of-the-pythagorean-theorem>What was the proof of the Pythagorean theorem?</h2>
<p>There are many different proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. The proof that we will give here was discovered by James Garfield in 1876. Garfield later became the 20th President of the United States. The two key facts that are needed for Garfield’s proof are: 1. The sum of the angles of any triangle is 180.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-facts-needed-for-garfields-proof>What are the two facts needed for Garfield’s proof?</h2>
<p>Garfield later became the 20th President of the United States. The two key facts that are needed for Garfield’s proof are: 1. The sum of the angles of any triangle is 180. 2. The area of a trapezoid with bases of lengthb1andb2and heighthis A1 2 b1b2h.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-james-a-garfield-go-to-college>Where did James A Garfield go to college?</h2>
<p>James A. Garfield (1831-1881) was the twentieth president of the United States. After he graduated from Williams College in 1856, he taught Greek, Latin, mathematics, history, philosophy, and rhetoric at Western Reserve Eclectic Institute, now Hiram College, in Hiram, Ohio, a private liberal arts institute.</p>
