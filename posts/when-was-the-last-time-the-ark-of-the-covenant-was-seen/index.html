<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-the-ark-of-the-covenant-was-seen>When was the last time the Ark of the Covenant was seen?</h2>
<p>587 B.C.<br>
The ark vanished when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem in 587 B.C. When the ark was captured by the Philistines, outbreaks of tumors and disease afflicted them, forcing the Philistines to return the ark to the Israelites.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-claims-to-have-the-ark-of-the-covenant>What country claims to have the Ark of the Covenant?</h2>
<p>Ethiopia<br>
Christians in Ethiopia have long claimed to have the ark of the covenant. Our reporter investigated. “They shall make an ark of acacia wood,” God commanded Moses in the Book of Exodus, after delivering the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. And so the Israelites built an ark, or chest, gilding it inside and out.</p>
<h2 id=has-anyone-seen-the-ark-of-the-covenant-in-ethiopia>Has anyone seen the Ark of the Covenant in Ethiopia?</h2>
<p>There is only one man alive who has seen the alleged Ark in all its biblical glory. It is, according to Ethiopian lore, hidden in a church in Aksum—a small city in the northern highlands—and guarded by a single monk. Nobody else enters the room and only after his death will the monk leave the grounds.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-ark-of-the-covenant-and-where-is-it>What is the Ark of the Covenant and where is it?</h2>
<p>Following the conquest of Canaan, the Promised Land, the Ark resided at Shiloh, but from time to time it was carried into battle by the Israelites. Taken to Jerusalem by King David, it was eventually placed in the Temple by King Solomon.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-the-ark-of-the-covenant-worth>How much is the Ark of the Covenant worth?</h2>
<p>Indiana Jones Ark of the Covenant Worth Up to $250,000 According to Antiques Roadshow.</p>
<h2 id=what-power-does-the-ark-of-the-covenant-have>What power does the Ark of the Covenant have?</h2>
<p>This object made by Moses at Mount Sinai–part wooden-metal box and part golden statue–had the power to create “lightning” to kill people, and also to fly and lead people through the wilderness.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-the-ark-of-the-covenant-worth-today>How much is the Ark of the Covenant worth today?</h2>
<p>“This is the closest anybody in the private market can get to owning the Ark of the Covenant from the Raiders of the Lost Ark,” Supp said. “We estimate at auction a very conservative value of $80,000 to $120,000.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-inside-ark-of-covenant>What was inside Ark of Covenant?</h2>
<p>New Testament Hebrews 9:4 states that the Ark contained “the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.” Revelation 11:19 says the prophet saw God’s temple in heaven opened, “and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple.”</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-ark-of-the-covenant-represent>What does the ark of the covenant represent?</h2>
<p>The Ark was a picture of the Person and saving work of Christ. The manna in the golden bowl represented the life-sustaining food that God gives His people in Christ. When Israel was in the wilderness, the Lord sustained them with this mysterious bread.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-ark-so-important>Why is the Ark so important?</h2>
<p>Because it symbolizes the Holy of Holies of the ancient Temple of Jerusalem, it is the holiest place in the synagogue and the focal point of prayer.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-would-the-holy-grail-be-worth>How much would the Holy Grail be worth?</h2>
<p>A rare first-edition of a “Harry Potter” book deemed to be a “holy grail” could be worth as much as $65,000 when it goes up for auction next month.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-would-the-ark-of-the-covenant-weigh>How much would the Ark of the Covenant weigh?</h2>
<p>Using the density of cypress, they calculated the weight of this hypothetical ark: 1,200,000 kilograms (by comparison the Titanic weighed about 53,000,000 kilograms).</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-ark-of-the-covenant-in-ethiopia>Where is the Ark of the Covenant in Ethiopia?</h2>
<p>Apart from the Ethiopian government, the country’s largest religious denomination, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, understands the Kebra Negast to be legitimate Christian history. According to church leaders, the Ark of the Covenant has for centuries been closely guarded in Aksum at the Church of St. Mary of Zion.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-ark-of-the-covenant-in-the-church>Is the Ark of the Covenant in the church?</h2>
<p>Even more importantly, Jesus is no longer physically here on the earth. His Body, the Church, and every believer, are the Tabernacles in which God presently dwells. God’s Spirit, the very Presence of God in all His fullness, is dwelling in your spirit right now. This is what the Ark of the Covenant symbolizes.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-ark-of-the-covenant-disappear>When did the Ark of the Covenant disappear?</h2>
<p>The Ark of the Covenant disappeared from history after Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon, invaded Jerusalem in 597 BC. Earlier in 605 BC, he invaded the Kingdom of Judah. There was no mention of the Ark upon the return of Jews from Babylonian captivity.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-custodian-of-the-ark-of-the-covenant>Who is the custodian of the Ark of the Covenant?</h2>
<p>Not even the high priest of Aksum can enter its resting chamber. Its sole custodian is a virgin monk who cannot leave the sacred grounds until his death. The Ark’s influence, though, is felt throughout the Ethiopian Orthodox world.</p>
