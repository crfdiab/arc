<h2 id=what-countries-have-school-all-year-long>What countries have school all year long?</h2>
<p>Several countries around the world have year-round schooling or schooling programs. Some of these countries include China, Japan, Nigeria, Australia, South Korea and North Korea.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-months-is-a-school-year>How many months is a school year?</h2>
<p>How Many Months Are In a School Year? Based on 40-weeks per school year in the US, and each month containing an average of 4.35 weeks, the average number of months in a school year would be 9.2 (40 weeks ÷ 4.35 weeks per month = 9.2 months).</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-school-year-in-most-countries>How long is the school year in most countries?</h2>
<p>The school terms in these countries typically run for 11 months on a trimester or quarter system, wherein a week or so of vacation exists between each term. Year-round schooling is a bit of a misnomer, as several countries have academic years that go nearly year round, but have one month given over to breaks or vacation.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-countries-that-start-school-in-january>Are there any countries that start school in January?</h2>
<p>Below is a partial list of countries where school begins in January or February. The information was compiled from several sources but I couldn’t find exact dates for 2016 for several countries. If you know when the school year in these countries begins, please leave a note in the Comments below so I can add that information to this blog post.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-most-kids-go-to-school-in-the-world>Where do most kids go to school in the world?</h2>
<p>While kids in places like Australia and New Zealand can expect to spend nearly 20 years in school, from the primary school level until the tertiary, or post-high school level; kids in places like Pakistan and Ethiopia can expect to spend less than 10 years in school. Below, we have compiled a map of the report’s results.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-days-do-you-go-to-school-in-the-uk>How many days do you go to school in the UK?</h2>
<p>Hours spent in school per day are fairly low and class sizes are small. However, school days per year are on the higher side, and number of years in school match the UK with the largest age range. Anybody fancy a transfer to Erinsborough High ?!</p>
