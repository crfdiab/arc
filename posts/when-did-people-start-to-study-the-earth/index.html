<h2 id=when-did-people-start-to-study-the-earth>When did people start to study the Earth?</h2>
<p>Recognizable humans emerged at most 2 million years ago, a vanishingly small period on the geological scale. The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago, during the Eoarchean Era, after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-the-age-of-the-earth>Who discovered the age of the Earth?</h2>
<p>geologist Arthur Holmes<br>
These atoms will decay as the rock ages, and by measuring the ratio of radioactive isotopes within the rock, scientists can figure out how long it has been around. In 1913, geologist Arthur Holmes published “the Age of the Earth,” the first major effort to date the planet using radiometric dating.</p>

<p>4,543 billion years<br>
Earth/Age</p>
<p>By dating the rocks in Earth’s ever-changing crust, as well as the rocks in Earth’s neighbors, such as the moon and visiting meteorites, scientists have calculated that Earth is 4.54 billion years old, with an error range of 50 million years.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-victorians-think-about-science>What did the Victorians think about science?</h2>

<p>Age of the Earth. Earth is estimated to be 4.54 billion years old, plus or minus about 50 million years. Scientists have scoured the Earth searching for the oldest rocks to radiometrically date.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-victorian-era-start-and-end>When did the Victorian era start and end?</h2>
<p>The Victorian era of British history was the period of Queen Victoria’s reign from 20 June 1837 until her death, on 22 January 1901. It was a long period of peace, prosperity, refined sensibilities and national self-confidence for Britain.</p>

<p>Despite the popularisation of science sparked by Victorian science gossip —scientific journals grew from just 10 in 1700 to 10,000 by 1900— the frivolous ones were forced to close due to the increasing professionalisation of science, especially in the 19th century.</p>
