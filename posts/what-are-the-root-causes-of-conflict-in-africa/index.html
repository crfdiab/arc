<h2 id=unpredictable-policies-what-are-the-4-types-of-conflicts>Unpredictable policies. What are the 4 types of conflicts?</h2>
<p>The opposing force created, the conflict within the story generally comes in four basic types: Conflict with the self, Conflict with others, Conflict with the environment and Conflict with the supernatural.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-of-war-in-africa>What are the causes of war in Africa?</h2>
<p>The causes of war, and other forms of armed conflict are complex and each conflict situation is unique (Williams, 2016: 6). The purpose of this study is, therefore, to identify and analyse the causes of war and conflict in Africa. The study will be guided by three main questions: 1.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-root-causes-of-armed-conflict>What are the root causes of armed conflict?</h2>
<p>The individual level of analysisAt the individual level of analysis, armed conflict can be caused by the selfishness and greed of actors who want to have exclusive access to a country’s resources. Armed conflict can also arise from the unrestrained ambitions of political leaders who have a tendency to cling to power (Grieco, et al., 2015: 9).</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-conflicts-in-horn-of-africa>Why are there so many conflicts in Horn of Africa?</h2>
<p>(Alexander Attilio, 2002). The Horn region is one of the most conflict-ravaged areas on the African continent. It is a region well known in African politics of being a volatile, hostile and poor place due to numerous conflicts, wars, and colorizations. The populations of the region have endured many inter-state and intra-state armed conflicts.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-armed-conflict-in-africa>What are the effects of armed conflict in Africa?</h2>
<p>The changing nature of armed conflict in Africa and its effects on the continent’s biodiversity and ecosystems has rendered these natural resources even more vulnerable than in previous times.</p>
