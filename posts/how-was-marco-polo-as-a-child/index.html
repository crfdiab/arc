<h2 id=how-was-marco-polo-as-a-child>How was Marco Polo as a child?</h2>
<p>Although he was born to a wealthy Venetian merchant family, much of Polo’s childhood was spent parentless, and he was raised by an extended family. Polo’s mother died when he was young, and his father and uncle, successful jewel merchants Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, were in Asia for much of Polo’s youth.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-mongolias-main-religion>What is Mongolia’s main religion?</h2>
<p>Buddhism<br>
Religious demography Buddhism and the country’s traditions are closely tied, and while 26.5 percent of the population are atheists, 59.7 percent of religious Mongolians practice some form of Buddhism. Lamaist Buddhism and within it the Gelugpa school is the traditional and dominant religion.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-game-of-marco-polo-the-same-as-water-polo>Is the game of Marco Polo the same as water polo?</h2>
<p>Although water polo is another popular pool game, the name of ‘Marco Polo’ is apparently unrelated. The game has similar traits with blind man’s buff, an essentially identical game played on dry land which dates back to at least the 16th century.</p>

<p>Marco Polo: The Early Years. Marco Polo’s Travels Along the Silk Road. Marco Polo in Venice. Marco Polo (1254-1324) was a Venetian merchant believed to have journeyed across Asia at the height of the Mongol Empire. He first set out at age 17 with his father and uncle, traveling overland along what later became known as the Silk Road.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-princess-that-marco-polo-married>Who was the princess that Marco Polo married?</h2>
<p>In 1292 the Polos joined a flotilla of 14 boats that set out from Zaitun (now Quanzhou, China), stopped briefly in Sumatra and then landed in Persia 18 months later, only to find out that Arghun was dead. The princess was made to marry Arghun’s son.</p>

<p>Kublai quizzed them on European affairs and decided to send them on a goodwill mission to the pope. In 1269, the two brothers finally made it back to Venice, where Niccolò and Marco Polo met each other for the first time. Two years later, Niccolò and Maffeo sailed to Acre in present-day Israel, this time with Marco at their side.</p>
