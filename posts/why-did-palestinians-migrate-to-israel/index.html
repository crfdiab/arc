<h2 id=why-did-palestinians-migrate-to-israel>Why did Palestinians migrate to Israel?</h2>
<p>Most of the people in question were refugees attempting to return to their homes, take back possessions that had been left behind during the war and to gather crops from their former fields and orchards inside the new Israeli state. Between 30,000 and 90,000 Palestinian refugees returned to Israel as a result.</p>
<h2 id=can-palestinian-refugees-return-to-israel>Can Palestinian refugees return to Israel?</h2>
<p>There is no formal mechanism in international law to demand repatriation of refugees and their descendants in general, or Palestinians specifically. No international legislation, binding UN resolutions or agreements between Israel and the Palestinians require this.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-palestinian-refugees-live-in-israel>How many Palestinian refugees live in Israel?</h2>
<p>As of 2019, more than 5.6 million Palestinians were registered with UNRWA as refugees, of which more than 1.5 million live in UNRWA-run camps. The term “Palestine refugee” does not include internally displaced Palestinians, who became Israeli citizens and neither displaced Palestinian Jews.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-refugees-in-palestine>Why are there so many refugees in Palestine?</h2>
<p>This is the reason why the issue of Palestinian refugees is perceived more as the reflection of an ongoing lapse by Arab countries, Israel, and the international community, which have been unable to separate the solution to this problem from the greater political arrangement between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-arab-refugees-left-in-israel>Are there any Arab refugees left in Israel?</h2>
<p>More than 60 years after the establishment of Israel, there is no Arab-Israeli issue that remains as utterly divisive as the fate of Palestinian refugees. In the course of Israel’s creation in 1948 and its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, more than half the Arabs of pre-1948 Palestine are thought to have been displaced.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-palestinians-want-to-return-to-palestine>Why did the Palestinians want to return to Palestine?</h2>
<p>It is well-known and understood that the Arabs, in demanding the return of the refugees to Palestine, mean their return as masters of the Homeland and not as slaves. With a greater clarity, they mean the liquidation of the State of Israel (Al-Misri, October 11, 1949).</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-palestinian-refugees-escape-from-in-1948>Where did the Palestinian refugees escape from in 1948?</h2>
<p>Thousands rushed every available craft, even rowboats, along the waterfront, to escape by sea toward Acre ( New York Times, April 23, 1948). In Tiberias and Haifa, the Haganah issued orders that none of the Arabs’ possessions should be touched and warned that anyone who violated the orders would be severely punished.</p>
