<h2 id=when-was-the-valley-of-mexico-settled>When was the Valley of Mexico settled?</h2>
<p>1325<br>
It was founded by the Mexica (Aztecs) on a small island in the western part of Lake Texcoco in 1325, and was extended with the use of chinampas, human-made extensions of agricultural land into the southern lake system, to increase productive agricultural land, covering about 9,000 hectares (35 sq mi).</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-mexico-valley>Who discovered Mexico Valley?</h2>
<p>The Aztecs arrived in the Valley of Mexico as homeless wanderers about 1300 A.D. They came the region above the Gulf of California. One of their shamans told them that had to wander until the found an eagle sitting on a cactus eating a snake. They found that scene in the Valley of Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=is-mexico-city-in-a-valley>Is Mexico City in a valley?</h2>
<p>As an “alpha” global city Mexico City is one of the most important financial centers in North America. It is located in the Valley of Mexico (Valle de México), a large valley in the high plateaus at the center of Mexico, at an altitude of 2,240 metres (7,350 ft).</p>
<h2 id=when-the-mexica-or-aztecs-arrived-in-the-valley-of-mexico-after-a-200-year-migration>When the Mexica or Aztecs arrived in the Valley of Mexico after a 200 year migration?</h2>
<p>After two centuries of migration, around 1250, the Mexica arrived in the Valley of Mexico. Today, the Basin of Mexico is filled with the sprawling metropolis of Mexico City. Underneath the modern streets are the ruins of Tenochtitlán, the site where the Mexica settled. It was the capital city of the Aztec empire.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-hispanic-and-mexican>What’s the difference between Hispanic and Mexican?</h2>
<p>A Mexican is a person from Mexico or a citizen of the USA who has both Mexican parents. Mexican doesn’t only refer to people, it also refers to anyone or anything related to Mexico such as food, culture, flag, etc. Hispanic then refers to anyone who has ties with Spain, the Spanish language or the Spanish culture.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-spanish-arrive-in-the-valley-of-mexico>When did the Spanish arrive in the valley of Mexico?</h2>
<p>The Aztecs expanded and expanded until they had built an empire. One day, around 1500 CE, Spanish soldiers arrived in the Valley of Mexico. They were amazed at what they saw.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-aztecs-live-in-the-valley-of-mexico>Where did the Aztecs live in the valley of Mexico?</h2>
<p>These people were called the Aztecs. When the Aztecs arrived in the Valley of Mexico, other tribes were already in residence. They had already taken the best land. The Aztecs had to make due with the swampy shores of Lake Texcoco. But this did not bother the Aztecs.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-toltec-empire-leave-the-valley-of-mexico>When did the Toltec Empire leave the valley of Mexico?</h2>
<p>After the end of the Toltec empire in the 13th century and the decline of the city of Tula, the population shifted once again, this time to the lakes region of the valley. With this migration came the concept of a city-state based on the Toltec model.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-mexican-immigrants-go-back-to-mexico>When did Mexican immigrants go back to Mexico?</h2>
<p>Yes. At the onset of the Depression in 1929, entire industries dried up, and the need for immigrant labor decreased. Many Mexican migrants found themselves suddenly impoverished and tens of thousands of rural workers went back to Mexico.</p>
