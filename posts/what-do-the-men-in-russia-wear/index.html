<h2 id=what-do-the-men-in-russia-wear>What do the men in Russia wear?</h2>
<p>Traditional Russian men’s clothing was practically identical across all of medieval Russia. The basic outfit consisted of pants, a shirt, a hat, and a belt. If women could decorate even the most simple everyday clothing, then men’s traditional clothing differed in its asceticism.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-traditional-russian-clothing>What is traditional Russian clothing?</h2>
<p>There are two major types of Russian ethnic dress: the sarafan and the poneva. A sarafan is a loosely fitting long jumper dress worn over a long linen shirt and belted. A necessary component of traditional Russian dress, the belt was often worn under the sarafan.</p>

<p>A kosovorotka (Russian: косоворо́тка, IPA: [kəsəvɐˈrotkə]), commonly known in the West as a Zhivago shirt, Russian peasant shirt or Tolstoy shirt (tolstovka). The name comes from the Russian phrase kosoy vorot (косой ворот), meaning a “skewed collar”.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-typical-russian-dinner>What is a typical Russian dinner?</h2>
<p>A typical Russian dinner will consist of one or more salads, which are heavy, filled with potatoes and often mayonnaise, with flavors coming from beets, onions, pickles, and various kinds of meat (these salads are actually delicious—don’t knock it ’till you’ve tried it!). Following the salads, a meat course is served.</p>
