<h2 id=is-madagascar-a-free-country>Is Madagascar a free country?</h2>
<p>The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at Antananarivo. Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state.</p>
<h2 id=does-madagascar-have-a-parliament>Does Madagascar have a parliament?</h2>
<p>The Parliament of Madagascar has two chambers: The National Assembly (Malagasy: Antenimieram-Pirenena / French: Assemblée Nationale) has 151 members, elected for five-year terms in single-member and two-member constituencies. The Senate (Malagasy: Antenimierandoholona / French: Sénat) has 33 members.</p>
<h2 id=does-madagascar-have-a-president-or-prime-minister>Does Madagascar have a President or Prime Minister?</h2>
<p>Type of Government Executive: The President is elected by popular vote for a 5-year term (eligible for a second term). The Prime Minister is nominated by the National Assembly and appointed by the President. Legislative: Bicameral Parliament – National Assembly (Antenimierapirenena) (151 seats) and Senate (63 seats).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-madagascar-become-a-democracy>When did Madagascar become a democracy?</h2>
<p>Democratic Republic of Madagascar</p>

<h2 id=what-type-of-government-does-madagascar-have-2021>What type of government does Madagascar have 2021?</h2>
<p>Politics of Madagascar takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Madagascar is head of state and the Prime Minister of Madagascar is head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-system-of-government-does-madagascar-have>What kind of system of government does Madagascar have?</h2>
<p>Madagascar is a democratic republic with a semi-presidential system of government whereby executive powers are shared between the President and the Prime Minister. Additionally, Madagascar is a multi-party state. Madagascar’s system of governance is widely borrowed from the French government.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-customs-or-laws-in-madagascar>Are there any customs or laws in Madagascar?</h2>
<p>Larger towns such as Antananarivo do observe some Fady, but are more likely to excuse foreigners who don’t adhere to their taboos. It is essential to respect all Fady and avoid violating local customs in Madagascar. Ready to reconnect with the world?</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-the-french-in-madagascar>What was the role of the French in Madagascar?</h2>
<p>The army played no direct political role in Madagascar until 1972, although the presence of French army units had bolstered the former government. The French troops were withdrawn in 1973, and the French naval base at Antsiranana was handed over to Madagascar in 1975. The Malagasy armed forces consist of an army, a navy, and an air force.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-parliament-do-they-have-in-madagascar>What kind of Parliament do they have in Madagascar?</h2>
<p>In Madagascar, the parliament has two chambers; the National Assembly and the Senate. The Legislature is unable to constrain Presidential authority, as it has become a marginal part of the system, in service to, rather than in check of, Presidential executive power.</p>
