<h2 id=why-does-it-hail-sometimes-in-a-thunderstorm>Why does it hail sometimes in a thunderstorm?</h2>
<p>Hailstones are formed when raindrops are carried upward by thunderstorm updrafts into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere and freeze. The hail falls when the thunderstorm’s updraft can no longer support the weight of the hailstone, which can occur if the stone becomes large enough or the updraft weakens.</p>
<h2 id=is-hail-a-sign-of-a-storm>Is hail a sign of a storm?</h2>
<p>Any thunderstorm which produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm. Hail has a diameter of 5 millimetres (0.20 in) or more. Hailstones can grow to 15 centimetres (6 in) and weigh more than 0.5 kilograms (1.1 lb). Stones larger than 2 cm (0.80 in) are usually considered large enough to cause damage.</p>
<h2 id=can-thunderstorms-cause-hail>Can thunderstorms cause hail?</h2>
<p>Nearly all severe thunderstorms probably produce hail aloft, though it may melt before reaching the ground. Multi-cell thunderstorms produce many hailstones, but they are not usually very large. In all cases, the hail falls when the thunderstorm’s updraft can no longer support the weight of the ice.</p>
<h2 id=can-it-hail-in-100-degree-weather>Can it hail in 100 degree weather?</h2>
<p>Hail forms when strong currents of rising air, known as updrafts, carry droplets of water high enough that they freeze. This is why it can still hail in the summertime – the air at ground level may be warm, but it can still be cold enough higher up in the sky.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-tell-if-it-is-going-to-hail>How do you tell if it is going to hail?</h2>
<p>Gray clouds, rain, thunder or lighting are all signs of a possible hailstorm. You should also take note if you feel a sudden drop in temperature. Cold fronts are a strong indicator that hail or other forms of severe weather are on their way and that you’ll be safer indoors.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-worst-thunderstorm-in-history>What’s the worst thunderstorm in history?</h2>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — The derecho storm in Iowa from this summer is the most expensive thunderstorm disaster in U.S. history. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is estimating total damage valued at $7.5 billion.</p>
<h2 id=can-it-hail-in-75-degree-weather>Can it hail in 75 degree weather?</h2>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-use-hail-as-ice>Is it safe to use hail as ice?</h2>
<p>Hail, like rain, or other forms of natural precipitation, is just water, only that it is frozen during its path up and down in between gravity and up-draft before landing. So hail, yes we can eat hail just like we can eat ice (pun intended)! Most of our Global drinking water is indeed collected from precipitation.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-sky-turn-green-when-a-tornado-comes>Why does the sky turn green when a tornado comes?</h2>
<p>The “greenage” or green color in storms does not mean a tornado is coming. The green color does signify the storm is severe though. The color is from the water droplets suspended in the storm, absorbing red sunlight and radiating green frequencies.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-do-hailstones-get-in-a-thunderstorm>How big do hailstones get in a thunderstorm?</h2>
<p>Hail: Summer’s Ice Storms. The pellets can range in size from small pea-sized pellets to hailstones as large as grapefruits (more on hail size below). The formation of hail means a severe thunderstorm is likely in your vicinity. You should monitor your weather situation closely for thunder, lightning, torrential rain, and possibly even tornadoes.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-of-a-thunderstorm>What are the causes of a thunderstorm?</h2>
<p>A thunderstorm caused when warm and moist air rises and swift updraft to colder regions of the atmosphere affecting the zone with its irresistible destruction, is an intense, short-lived weather disturbance. It is a storm associated with the presence of lightning, thunder, formation of dense clouds, heavy rain, and strong gusty winds.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-hail-often-mistaken-for-cold-weather>Why is Hail often mistaken for cold weather?</h2>
<p>Because it’s made of ice, hail is often mistaken as a cold weather event, but in reality, it is associated with severe thunderstorms — not winter weather.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-a-hail-storm-to-form>How long does it take for a hail storm to form?</h2>
<p>Hail usually forms over an area and leaves within a few minutes. However, there have been instances when a hail storm has stayed in the same area for several minutes, leaving several inches of ice covering the ground. Okay, but if hail is a summer weather event rather than a winter one, how do temperatures get cold enough to form ice, you ask?</p>
