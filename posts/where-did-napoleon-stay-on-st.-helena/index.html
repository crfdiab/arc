<p>Longwood House<br>
Longwood House is a mansion in St. Helena and the final residence of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte of France, during his exile on the island of Saint Helena, from 10 December 1815 until his death on 5 May 1821.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-napoleon-live-on-st-helena>How did Napoleon live on St. Helena?</h2>
<p>Napoleon arrived on board the Northumberland on October 17, 1815, and spend his first night on the island in a small inn which no longer exists. The following day, he went to Longwood House, the house in which he was supposed to settle during his captivity.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-napoleon-exiled-to-the-first-time-did-he-stay>Where was Napoleon exiled to the first time did he stay?</h2>
<p>Napoleon abdicates the throne and is exiled to Elba On April 11, 1814, Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France and one of the greatest military leaders in history, abdicates the throne, and, in the Treaty of Fontainebleau, is banished to the Mediterranean island of Elba.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-years-did-napoleon-live-in-st-helena>How many years did Napoleon live in St Helena?</h2>
<p>However he died just before it was completed, after six years in exile on the island.</p>

<p>June 18, 1815<br>
The Battle of Waterloo, which took place in Belgium on June 18, 1815, marked the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte, who conquered much of Europe in the early 19th century.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-napoleon-live-when-he-first-arrived-on-st-helena>Where did Napoleon live when he first arrived on St Helena?</h2>
<p>William Balcombe, employee of the East India Company and one-time family friend of the French emperor, put Napoleon up at Briars Pavilion when he first arrived on the island. However a few months later in December 1815, the emperor was moved to nearby Longwood House, a property said to have been particularly cold, uninviting and infested with rats.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-napoleon-go-on-his-return-voyage>Where did Napoleon go on his return voyage?</h2>
<p>Travellers looking to follow in Napoleon’s footsteps can board the Royal Mail ship St Helena from £2,526* on a 15-day return voyage from Cape Town (10 days at sea and four nights on St Helena).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-northumberland-arrive-at-st-helena>When did the Northumberland arrive at St Helena?</h2>
<p>St. Helena came into view over two months later, on October 14, as a small dark dot on the horizon. The following day, the Northumberland dropped anchor off the island’s main settlement of Jamestown. British naval surgeon William Warden observed:</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-governor-of-st-helena-in-1816>Who was the Governor of St Helena in 1816?</h2>
<p>Nor did he have any news of his son, the former king of Rome, who was now living in Vienna with the title of duke of Reichstadt. Though the severity of Sir Hudson Lowe has been much exaggerated, it is certain that this “jailer,” who arrived as governor of St. Helena in April 1816, did nothing to make Napoleon’s life easier.</p>
