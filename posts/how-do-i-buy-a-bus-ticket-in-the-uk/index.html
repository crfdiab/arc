<h2 id=how-do-i-buy-a-bus-ticket-in-the-uk>How do I buy a bus ticket in the UK?</h2>
<p>You can buy a Bus & Tram Pass:</p>
<ol>
<li>Online with a contactless and Oyster account, if you have a UK bank account (7 Day, Monthly and Annual Passes)</li>
<li>Using the free TfL Oyster and contactless app (7 Day, Monthly and Annual Passes)</li>
<li>At Oyster ticket stops in many newsagents in London (One Day, 7 Day and Monthly Passes)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-do-i-contact-megabus-customer-service>How do I contact Megabus customer service?</h2>
<p>Customers are also welcome to call 1-877-GO2-MEGA (1-877-462-6342) to have one of our dedicated customer service representatives assist them with their reservation.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-charge-my-phone-on-megabus-uk>Can I charge my phone on Megabus UK?</h2>
<p>Free Wi-Fi and charging points You’ll also get charging points* at every seat, so you can charge your gadgets along the way. Just bear in mind, these are subject to availability and connection.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-bus-ticket-uk>How much is a bus ticket UK?</h2>
<p>Choose a Visitor Oyster card, an Oyster card, a Travelcard or a contactless payment card to pay your fare. A single London bus journey costs £1.55 no matter how far you go (unlike the Tube zone fare system). You can even take multiple buses within one hour at no extra charge thanks to the Hopper fare system.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-a-bus-cost-to-buy-uk>How much does a bus cost to buy UK?</h2>
<p>Transport for London has released the costs for buying the New Bus for London fleet, and despite years of soothing reassurances from the Mayor that they’ll cost less than normal hybrids, they’ll actually cost a bit more. If you look at the current cost of a bus, £250,000, roughly speaking, buys you a new bendy bus.</p>
<h2 id=is-megabus-reliable>Is megabus reliable?</h2>
<p>Is Megabus reliable? The short answer is yes, absolutely. More so than Greyhound, that’s for sure. I’ve had to suffer through a couple of minor delays where the bus showed up 15-20 minutes late.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-pay-megabus-cash>Can you pay megabus cash?</h2>
<p>Payment for reservations can be made using major credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Unfortunately megabus reservations cannot be paid for in cash or by check.</p>
<h2 id=is-megabus-good-uk>Is megabus good UK?</h2>
<p>The service wasn’t bad, the buses were fairly clean and it was a fair price, but it has just gone extremely downhill in recent months. If you can splash out on a train ticket, do it because Megabus isn’t worth it.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-use-my-free-bus-pass-on-megabus-in-scotland>Can I use my free bus pass on megabus in Scotland?</h2>
<p>Free concessionary travel with megabus is only available to Scottish National Entitlement Card holders (elderly and disabled persons) and in the case of companion card holders – their companions.</p>
<h2 id=how-strict-is-megabus-with-luggage-uk>How strict is megabus with luggage UK?</h2>
<p>We don’t mind what your luggage is packed in, and we only ask that it weighs no more than 20kg. It can’t be any bigger than a standard ‘large’ suitcase. The maximum size of a single bag is 200cm (width + height + depth). Or, you can take two or three bags.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-toilets-on-megabus-uk>Are there toilets on megabus UK?</h2>
<p>What facilities do your coaches and trains offer? Most of our coaches have free Wi-Fi, on board charging points, air-con and an onboard toilet. These modern trains are air-conditioned and have on board toilets and refreshment facilities available on most services. There aren’t any comfort stops on any megabus services.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-change-a-megabus-ticket>How much does it cost to change a Megabus ticket?</h2>
<p>It costs £2.50 to change a booking online (£1.50 amendment fee and £1 re-booking fee). Changes made with an authorised megabus agency will cost £4.50 (£3.50 amendment fee and £1.00 re-booking fee). If your new journey is more expensive than the original one, you’ll also need to pay the difference between the two fares.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-buy-megabus-tickets-in-scotland>Where can I buy Megabus tickets in Scotland?</h2>
<p>Ticket purchase is available from the driver on all internal Scottish services, subject to seats being available.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-pay-an-amendment-fee-for-megabus>Do you have to pay an amendment fee for Megabus?</h2>
<p>Changes can be made online or with an authorised megabus agent. The amendment fee at an authorised megabus agent may be different to the amendment fee charged online. If your new journey is more expensive than the original one, you’ll also need to pay the difference between the two fares.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-go-on-megabus-in-uk>How old do you have to be to go on Megabus in UK?</h2>
<p>For megabus journeys which are only within the UK, one child aged 3 or under who isn’t occupying a seat can travel for free with one fare-paying adult. Additional infants will require child ticket purchase.</p>
