<h2 id=what-does-the-forest-floor-look-like>What does the forest floor look like?</h2>
<p>The forest floor, also called detritus, duff and the O horizon, is one of the most distinctive features of a forest ecosystem. It mainly consists of shed vegetative parts, such as leaves, branches, bark, and stems, existing in various stages of decomposition above the soil surface.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-conditions-on-the-forest-floor>What are the conditions on the forest floor?</h2>
<p>The forest floor is the lowest layer where it is dark, hot, and damp. Only two per cent of sunlight gets through the thick canopy trees and understorey plants to reach the forest floor. Large-leafed shrubs and saplings (new trees) grow in the patches of sunlight.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-forest-floor-composed-of>What is forest floor composed of?</h2>
<h2 id=why-is-nothing-growing-on-the-forest-floor>Why is nothing growing on the forest floor?</h2>
<p>The animals eat the leaves and fruit of the trees, insects, or other animals. The tall canopy trees must be able to reach the sunlight high in the air and still get nutrients from the thin soil on the forest floor. Their roots do not go deep into the soil because there is nothing there for the plants to reach.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-understorey-in-forest>What is Understorey in forest?</h2>
<p>The understory is the underlying layer of vegetation in a forest or wooded area, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor. They often are able to use wavelengths that canopy plants cannot.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-symptoms-of-bacteria-on-the-floor>What are the symptoms of bacteria on the floor?</h2>
<p>Headache, fever, and tiredness are some of the symptoms. If it happens, consult a doctor. Bacteria can come from anywhere, and it could get inside our house and down onto the floor where our kids run barefoot, crawl, and play. E-coli is a common bacteria, and there is a strain of it that is dangerous to humans.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-forest-floor-the-darkest-part-of-the-rainforest>Why is the forest floor the darkest part of the rainforest?</h2>
<p>Forest Floor Layer. The forest floor is the darkest of all rainforest layers, making it extremely difficult for plants to grow. Leaves that fall to the forest floor decay quickly. Decomposers, such as termites, slugs, scorpions, worms, and fungi, thrive on the forest floor.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-plants-that-grow-on-the-forest-floor>What are some plants that grow on the forest floor?</h2>
<p>Typical plants that are found on the forest floor include a variety of ferns, mangrove trees and vines such as the strangler fig. Plant growth opportunities are limited with little nutrients and light.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-forest-floor-important-to-plants>Why is the forest floor important to plants?</h2>
<p>The forest floor is covered in a layer of decomposition known as detritus. This fertile ground cover is important for nourishing the plants that are capable of surviving in the dark under layer of a forest.</p>
