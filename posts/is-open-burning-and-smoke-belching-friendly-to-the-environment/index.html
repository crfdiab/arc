<h2 id=is-open-burning-and-smoke-belching-friendly-to-the-environment>Is open burning and smoke belching friendly to the environment?</h2>
<p>Open burning adds a lot of particulate matter or PM into the environment. This particulate matter adds to the visibility troubles that already exist due to smoke, fog or even smog. These particles are not just hazardous for our health, but also, it is hazardous for our possessions as well.</p>
<h2 id=is-fire-smoke-bad-for-the-environment>Is fire smoke bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>But fire can be deadly, destroying homes, wildlife habitat and timber, and polluting the air with emissions harmful to human health. Fire also releases carbon dioxide—a key greenhouse gas—into the atmosphere. Fire’s effect on the landscape may be long-lasting.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-air-pollution-such-as-smoke-belching-affect-our-health>How does air pollution such as smoke belching affect our health?</h2>
<p>Air pollution is the black cloud belching from an industrial smokestack. It can cause lung damage, cancer, or other serious health problems in people who may not realize the possible danger of the unseen gases or particles in the air.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-burning-waste-affect-the-environment>How does burning waste affect the environment?</h2>
<p>Waste burning is a significant source of dangerous carcinogens like dioxins and furans, and black carbon, a short-lived climate pollutant that contributes to climate change, increased melting in polar regions due to the deposition of soot and black carbon on snow and ice, and numerous human health issues.</p>
<h2 id=what-burns-waste-release>What burns waste release?</h2>
<p>The incineration process burns the waste into hot gas and ash, reducing its volume by 90% and its weight by 30%. The heat is used to heat water and produce steam, in a very similar method to how coal and nuclear plants produce electricity; the water’s steam turns a steam turbine and produces power.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-factories-have-smoke>Why do factories have smoke?</h2>
<p>The smoke from factories contain the greenhouse gases that pollute air. It is emitted into the atmosphere from the factory burning of fossil fuels. The factories smoke contribute immensely to the release of the Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-fires-smoke>Why do fires smoke?</h2>
<p>When you put the fresh piece of wood or paper on a hot fire, the smoke you see is those volatile hydrocarbons evaporating from the wood. They start vaporizing at a temperature of about 300 degrees F (149 degrees Celsius). If the temperature gets high enough, these compounds burst into flame.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-pollution-on-human-health>What are the effects of pollution on human health?</h2>
<p>Exposure to high levels of air pollution can cause a variety of adverse health outcomes. It increases the risk of respiratory infections, heart disease and lung cancer. Both short and long term exposure to air pollutants have been associated with health impacts. More severe impacts affect people who are already ill.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-better-to-burn-or-bury-plastic>Is it better to burn or bury plastic?</h2>
<p>But studies have shown that recycling plastic waste saves more energy—by reducing the need to extract fossil fuel and process it into new plastic—than burning it, along with other household waste, can generate.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-smoke-belching-good-for-the-environment>Why is smoke belching good for the environment?</h2>
<p>Avoiding smoke belching can not only prevent you from the hefty fines MMDA has imposed but it also helps the environment to have a better air quality. As such, keeping your car in tip-top shape also contributes to limiting the impact of global warming. 6. FAQs about Smoke Belching in the Philippines</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-a-car-belches-smoke>What does it mean when a car belches smoke?</h2>
<p>The black smoke you see coming from a vehicle is called smoke belching. It is a forceful expulsion of thick smoke from an exhaust system. Smoke belching is quite common to see in Metro Manila especially from public utility vehicles that are used as public transport. You may ask, “is smoke belching in the Philippines legal?”</p>
<h2 id=is-it-against-the-law-to-belch-smoke>Is it against the law to belch smoke?</h2>
<p>It is also possible for small puffs of smoke to be considered smoke belching. Aside from being one of the biggest contributors to air pollution and the cause of many health issues, smoke belching is against the law, which is why drivers need to worry about it constantly.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-bad-to-belch-smoke-in-your-face>Is it bad to belch smoke in your face?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, smoke belching isn’t as obvious as a thick and dark cloud of smoke. There are moments when small puffs, though seemingly harmless, may land you in trouble. The reason for this is that smoke belching doesn’t really depend on the thickness or color of the smoke but on how much pollutant it carries.</p>
