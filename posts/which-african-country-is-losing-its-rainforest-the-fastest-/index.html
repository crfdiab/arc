<h2 id=which-african-country-is-losing-its-rainforest-the-fastest->Which African country is losing its rainforest the fastest *?</h2>
<p>Ghana is losing its rainforest faster than any other country in the world. Published May 1, 2019 This article is more than 2 years old. Ghana’s rainforest is being lost at an alarming rate, according to a new report about the state of forests worldwide.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-some-governments-ignore-industrial-pollution-of-major-rivers>Why do some governments ignore industrial pollution of major rivers?</h2>
<p>Some governments ignore industrial pollution of major rivers and waterways because they want their industries to make more profits.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-most-populous-countries-in-africa-whose-combined-populations-account-for-over-25-of-africas-population>What are the two most populous countries in Africa whose combined populations account for over 25% of Africa’s population?</h2>
<p>False What are the two most populous countries in Africa, whose combined populations account for over 25% of Africa’s population? Nigeria and Ethiopia Africa’s burgeoning middle class consumes many of the products theircountries would otherwise export.</p>

<p>Life in the Plantation South 6. African Americans in the British New World a. West African Society at the Point of European Contact b. “The Middle Passage” c. The Growth of Slavery d. Slave Life on the Farm and in the Town e. Free African Americans in the Colonial Era f. “Slave Codes” g.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-sharecropping-change-the-lives-of-african-americans>How did sharecropping change the lives of African Americans?</h2>
<p>In addition, while sharecropping gave African Americans autonomy in their daily work and social lives, and freed them from the gang-labor system that had dominated during the slavery era, it often resulted in sharecroppers owing more to the landowner (for the use of tools and other supplies, for example) than they were able to repay.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-african-americans-do-for-a-living>What did African Americans do for a living?</h2>
<p>That labor demand was filled by the forced labor of Africans. While most enslaved people worked in the field, others were used in the enslavers’ homes, assisting the owners in running the plantation and household as manservants, maids, cooks, and nannies.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-blacks-get-enough-money-to-own-land>How did blacks get enough money to own land?</h2>
<p>Some blacks managed to acquire enough money to move from sharecropping to renting or owning land by the end of the 1860s, but many more went into debt or were forced by poverty or the threat of violence to sign unfair and exploitative sharecropping or labor contracts that left them little hope of improving their situation.</p>
