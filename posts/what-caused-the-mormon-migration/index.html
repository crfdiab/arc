<h2 id=what-caused-the-mormon-migration>What caused the Mormon migration?</h2>
<p>For over 20 years, beginning in 1846, Mormon pioneers migrated through the mid-section of North America in hopes of finding a new home in the west. This is part of their story.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-mormons-stop-moving-to-utah>When did Mormons stop moving to Utah?</h2>
<p>1857<br>
In 1857 during the “Utah War,” the Mormons abandoned their Salt Lake City homes as the U.S. Army approached, but returned to them unscathed and would never again be forced to flee for their lives and abandon everything they knew; for the first time, they had found a permanent home.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-mormon-migration-to-utah>What was the Mormon migration to Utah?</h2>
<p>The Mormon pioneers were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), also known as Latter-day Saints, who migrated in the mid-1840s across the United States from the Midwest to the Salt Lake Valley in what is today the U.S. state of Utah.</p>
<h2 id=who-led-the-mormon-migration-to-the-great-salt-lake-area>Who led the Mormon migration to the Great Salt Lake area?</h2>
<p>Brigham Young<br>
After 17 months and many miles of travel, Brigham Young leads 148 pioneers into Utah’s Valley of the Great Salt Lake.</p>
<h2 id=is-utah-all-mormon>Is Utah All Mormon?</h2>
<p>Slightly over half of all Utahns are Mormons, the vast majority of whom are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which has its world headquarters in Salt Lake City; Utah is the only state where a majority of the population belongs to a single church.</p>
<h2 id=is-utah-a-good-state-to-retire-in>Is Utah a good state to retire in?</h2>
<p>Utah is an incredible place to retire in because of its excellent economy.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-rules-of-a-mormon>What are the rules of a Mormon?</h2>
<p>Commentary: How to be Mormon in just 73 easy steps</p>
<ul>
<li>Never use the word “Mormon” in describing anything Mormon.</li>
<li>Drink no coffee, tea or alcohol.</li>
<li>Eat meat sparingly.</li>
<li>Eat a lot of vegetables and fruits in their season.</li>
<li>Go to church every Sunday, even when you’re on vacation.</li>
<li>Accept any callings offered by the bishop.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=is-all-of-utah-mormon>Is all of Utah Mormon?</h2>
<h2 id=what-is-the-cheapest-city-to-live-in-utah>What is the cheapest city to live in Utah?</h2>
<p>The 5 Most Affordable Places to Live In Utah</p>

<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-mormons-in-utah>Why are there so many Mormons in Utah?</h2>
<p>Maybe the historical roots of the Church in Utah elevate Mormon practices. But the LDS Church and Utah culture continuously allow and encourage members to hold other people to their own standards, specifically to preserve their own religious and moral comfort (or to keep their prejudices intact).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-mormons-move-to-the-west>Why did the Mormons move to the west?</h2>
<p>Mormons had been considering moving west — beyond the borders of the United States — since before Joseph Smith’s 1844 murder, but his assassination made it clear that the period of relative calm the Mormon faithful had enjoyed in Nauvoo, Illinois, was coming to an end.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-mormons-cross-the-platte-river>Why did the Mormons cross the Platte River?</h2>

They were a people who felt called by God, chosen to create a New Jerusalem. It was fitting, then, that in order to realize the dream, the Mormons endured a 1,300-mile journey of Biblical proportions.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-mormons-come-to-the-united-states>When did the Mormons come to the United States?</h2>
<p>Between 1847 and 1869, when the Transcontinental Railroad was built, about 70,000 Mormons migrated to Utah along the Mormon Trail. Many of them got help from their church. If they could not pay their way across the ocean, or across the plains, the Church’s Perpetual Emigration Fund might loan them the money they needed.</p>
