<h2 id=what-did-anti-federalists-want-to-limit>What did Anti-Federalists want to limit?</h2>
<p>Anti-federalists opposed parts of the Constitution they thought limited the power of the states. They feared that a strong central government would overpower state governments, and eventually state governments would lose their independence and influence.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-the-anti-federalist-want-to-be-the-strongest>Who did the anti federalist want to be the strongest?</h2>
<p>Most Anti-Federalists feared that without a bill of rights, the Constitution would not be able to sufficiently protect the rights of individuals and the states. Perhaps the strongest voice for this concern was that of George Mason.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-federalists-and-anti-federalists-want>What did the Federalists and anti-federalists want?</h2>

<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-federalist-party>Who was the leader of the Federalist Party?</h2>

<h2 id=how-did-north-carolina-prevent-the-ratification-of-the-constitution>How did North Carolina prevent the ratification of the Constitution?</h2>
