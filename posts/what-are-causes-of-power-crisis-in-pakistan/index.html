<h2 id=what-are-causes-of-power-crisis-in-pakistan>What are causes of power crisis in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Weak governance, energy sector mismanagement and lacking investment electricity generation capacity have caused electricity supply to fall 32% short of demand.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-power-crisis>What is meant by power crisis?</h2>
<p>An energy crisis is any great blockage in supply of energy resources to an economy. It often refers to a decrease in the supply of electricity as compared to its demand. None can deny the importance of energy in today’s world. Energy drives man’s domestic life, industry, agriculture, and his automobiles, etc.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-of-electricity-crisis>What are the causes of electricity crisis?</h2>
<p>A crisis can develop due to industrial actions like union organized strikes and government embargoes. The cause may be over-consumption, aging infrastructure, choke point disruption or bottlenecks at oil refineries and port facilities that restrict fuel supply.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-solve-energy-problems-in-pakistan>How can we solve energy problems in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Alternate Ways to Overcome Energy Crisis in Pakistan</p>
<ol>
<li>ENERGY CONSERVATION AND ENERGY EFFICEINCY IMPROVEMENT.</li>
<li>ALTERNATE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY APPLICATIONS.</li>
<li>SOLAR THERMAL.</li>
<li>SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAICS.</li>
<li>SOLAR & LED LIGHTING.</li>
<li>WIND POWER.</li>
<li>ENERGY ADMINSTRATION AUTHORITY.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-can-we-ever-face-an-energy-crisis>How can we ever face an energy crisis?</h2>
<p>Possible Solutions to the Problem of Global Energy Crisis</p>
<ol>
<li>Move Towards Renewable Resources.</li>
<li>Buy Energy-Efficient Products.</li>
<li>Lighting Controls.</li>
<li>Easier Grid Access.</li>
<li>Energy Simulation.</li>
<li>Perform Energy Audit.</li>
<li>Common Stand on Climate Change.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-can-we-stop-energy-crisis>How can we stop energy crisis?</h2>
<p>In order to prevent an energy crisis, it is also crucial that we consume less energy by improving and modernising energy infrastructure such as smart grid solutions, and smart cities. It is also important that we replace old devices by energy efficient solutions, such as replacing traditional light bulbs by LEDs.</p>
<h2 id=why-pakistan-have-blackouts>Why Pakistan have blackouts?</h2>
<p>The blackout was triggered by a sudden drop in the frequency of the power transmission system from 50 to 0 in less than a second. “It had what we call a ‘cascading effect’ and shut down the power system, choking about 10,320 megawatt of electricity,” he explained.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-an-energy-crisis-in-pakistan>Why is there an energy crisis in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Energy crisis is a burning issue in Pakistan today.With the increasing population the demand for energy has increased but the generation of more power remain neglected. Two public sectors are responsible for the power distribution.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-power-shortage-in-pakistan>How big is the power shortage in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>The shortfall in the power sector can rise to around 7,000MW or 32pc of total demand for electricity. 2. Chronic power shortage, in the form of load-shedding and power outages, costed the Pakistan economy Rs14 billion (7pc of GDP) last year.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-way-to-generate-power-in-pakistan>Which is the best way to generate power in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Pakistan has great potential in generating power from other alternatives. Solar energy is a safe and easy method which need to adopted. Pakistan has abundance of sunshine throughout the year. Industries, public, private sector can easily be turned to solar energy for power generation.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-has-been-spent-on-power-in-pakistan>How much money has been spent on power in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Investment in the power sector has fallen to 0.7pc of the GDP in the last 10 years, from a high of 1.5pc during the 1980s and 1990s. 7. Rs30 billion is the approximate expenditure by Pakistani households on UPS and battery chargers alone.</p>
