<h2 id=what-transport-is-used-in-antarctica>What transport is used in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Transport in Antarctica takes place by air, using fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Runways and helicopter pads have to be kept snow free to ensure safe take off and landing conditions. Antarctica has 20 airports, but there are no developed public-access airports or landing facilities.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-antarctica-in-the-past>How was Antarctica in the past?</h2>
<p>It may be hard to believe, but Antarctica was once covered in towering forests. One hundred million years ago, the Earth was in the grip of an extreme Greenhouse Effect. The polar ice caps had all but melted; in the south, rainforests inhabited by dinosaurs existed in their place.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-antarctica-in-the-past-and-how-is-it-at-present>How was Antarctica in the past and how is it at present?</h2>
<p>Remote, inaccessible, and inhospitable, Antarctica was the last continent to be discovered, and knowledge of the south polar region was accumulated slowly. Until the present century the interior of Antarctica was unknown, and even the continental margins had been seen in only a few places.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-most-of-the-transport-in-antarctica-take-place>Where does most of the transport in Antarctica take place?</h2>
<p>Most are based in Ushuaia, Argentina. Transport in Antarctica takes place by air, using fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Runways and helicopter pads have to be kept snow free to ensure safe take off and landing conditions. Antarctica has 20 airports, but there are no developed public-access airports or landing facilities.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-vehicles-are-used-in-antarctica>What kind of vehicles are used in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>The Weasel was the first mechanical oversnow vehicle used by Australia on the Antarctic continent. Tractors, such as the Caterpillar D4, were used in the field and on station. Today, tracked oversnow vehicles such as Hägglunds move people and gear in Antarctica.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-people-able-to-travel-in-antarctica>How are people able to travel in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Vegetation builds up soils over time and this smooths rocks and boulders which become buried, this doesn’t happen in Antarctica, rocks are bare and more often than not (over 98% of the land area) the ground surface is snow and ice which can sometimes make travel easier or sometimes make it more difficult.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-public-access-airports-in-antarctica>Are there any public access airports in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Runways and helicopter pads have to be kept snow free to ensure safe take off and landing conditions. Antarctica has 20 airports, but there are no developed public-access airports or landing facilities.</p>
