<h2 id=when-was-macau-colonized>When was Macau colonized?</h2>
<p>Colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century, Macau was the first European settlement in the Far East. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and Portugal on 13 April 1987, Macau became the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 20 December 1999.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-portuguese-leave-macau>Why did the Portuguese leave Macau?</h2>
<p>3 reasons. China was strengthening in 1970s and 1980s. Portugal after the 1974 revolução wanted to quickly decolonise worldwide, and Portugal’s rule in Macau was weak and unpopular. UK set a precedent of giving back Hong Kong to China, so Portugal followed the wave.</p>
<h2 id=does-macanese-learn-portuguese>Does Macanese learn Portuguese?</h2>
<p>If Portugal or Brazil is the most powerful country in the world today, even people in Hong Kong will go learn Portuguese. Even in hong kong very few people speak fluent English, everybody in both hong kong and macau speaks standard cantonese at school, media, work.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-portuguese-take-control-of-macau>When did the Portuguese take control of Macau?</h2>
<p>The Portuguese controlled Macau from 1557 to December 20, 1999. How did tiny, far-off Portugal end up taking a bite of Ming China, and holding on through the entire Qing Eraand up to the dawn of the twenty-first century?</p>
<h2 id=when-was-macau-handed-back-to-chinese-sovereignty>When was Macau handed back to Chinese sovereignty?</h2>
<p>Macau was eventually handed back to Chinese sovereignty in 1999. Today, the 450-year legacy that the Portuguese left in Macau lives on through its distinct East-meets-West culture and architecture. In addition, Portuguese remains an official language. 6. It’s home to one of the world’s most critically endangered languages.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-macau-in-1999>What was the population of Macau in 1999?</h2>
<p>Large portions of the Macau population are Portuguese citizens, a legacy of the Portuguese colonial rule. At the time of Macau being returned to Chinese ownership in 1999, 107,000 residents held Portuguese passports.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-official-languages-of-macau>What are the two official languages of Macau?</h2>
<p>Originally made from broken pottery pieces from sailors ships, these designs are now created by Portuguese artists to bring the tradition and design into this century. Macau has two official languages – Cantonese and Portuguese.</p>
