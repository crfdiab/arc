<h2 id=does-georgia-have-same-sex-marriage>Does Georgia have same-sex marriage?</h2>
<p>Same-sex marriage was legalized in the U.S. state of Georgia on June 26, 2015, by the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges. Attorney General Sam Olens said Georgia would “adhere to the ruling of the Court”.</p>

<p>The following persons can perform a marriage ceremony in the state of Florida: All regularly ordained ministers of the gospel, elders in communion with a church, or other ordained clergy.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-jp-marry-you>Can a JP marry you?</h2>
<p>In the strict meaning of the term, a Justice of the Peace is a court judge with lessened legal privileges. Most importantly, Justices of the Peace also have the authority to perform wedding ceremonies and administer oaths to marrying couples.</p>

<p>Same-sex marriages have been in the public eye and agenda of discussions for about two decades, but little has been made to legalize the union until the first years of the 2000s. According to a 2004 referendum, 76% of Georgia voters were against same-sex marriage.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-get-married-in-georgia>Is it legal to get married in Georgia?</h2>
<p>As of 2015, all same-sex marriages officiated in Georgia and outside the state are considered legal by the laws of Georgia, with partners benefiting from the same rights as any other heterosexual couple, including in fields like taxation, name changing, any other legal matters, as well as adoption.</p>

<h2 id=is-it-legal-for-same-sex-marriage-in-all-50-states>Is it legal for same sex marriage in all 50 states?</h2>
<p>According to the ruling, all fifty states of the United States of America must adhere to the new law, and allow same-sex partners to legally officiate their union and, therefore, become a family in the eyes of God and the law. However, reaching this outcome hasn’t come easy.</p>
