<h2 id=how-many-forks-and-spoons-are-in-a-set>How many forks and spoons are in a set?</h2>
<p>It includes twelve dinner forks, twelve dinner spoons, twelve dinner knives, twenty-four salad forks, twenty-four teaspoons, one serving spoon, and one pierced serving spoon. That’s plenty to host guests for a dinner party, or your large extended family on a regular night.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-cover-in-table-setting>What is cover in table setting?</h2>
<p>A Cover is: Cover – arrangement of a place setting for one person; dinner plate is generally in the middle of the cover. Allow 20 -24 inches of space for each cover.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-arrange-flatware-on-a-cover>How do you arrange flatware on a cover?</h2>
<p>In what order should flatware be arranged on a cover?</p>
<ol>
<li>To the left of the plate is the fork.</li>
<li>To the right of the plate is the knife and spoon. The knife is placed to the right of the plate with the sharp edge toward the plate.</li>
<li>A water glass goes above the knife.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-are-the-standards-of-table-set-up>What are the standards of table set up?</h2>
<p>A general rule of table setting is that utensils are placed in the order of use from farthest from the dinner plate, utensils that are used first, to closest to the plate, utensils being used last, in an “outside-in” order. A second rule is that forks go to the left of the plate while knives and spoons go to the right.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-spoons-is-a-set>How many spoons is a set?</h2>
<p>In the U.S., measuring spoons often come in sets, usually between four and six. This usually includes ¼, ½, and 1 teaspoon and 1 tablespoon.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-sets-of-forks-should-you-have>How many sets of forks should you have?</h2>
<p>Think about How Many Place Settings You’ll Need A 45-piece flatware set generally includes eight place settings and five serving pieces. You’ll want to have enough flatware to serve eight to 12 people, plus a few more in case a piece is dropped during the meal and your guest needs a clean replacement.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-cover-etiquette>What is cover etiquette?</h2>
<p>The term “cover” is an individual’s place setting at the table, usually for a formal dinner. Cover is just another word for a place setting and includes dinnerware and utensils. There is no set etiquette as to how many plates, knives and other dinnerware items can be included in a cover.</p>
<h2 id=where-should-the-fork-be-placed-in-a-cover>Where should the fork be placed in a cover?</h2>
<p>If placed beside the plate, the fork goes on the left side, closest to the plate (because it will be the last fork used) and the spoon goes on the right side of the plate, to the right of the dinner knife and to the left of the soup spoon.</p>
<h2 id=which-direction-should-the-handle-of-a-teaspoon-face-when-it-is-served-to-a-guest>Which direction should the handle of a teaspoon face when it is served to a guest?</h2>
<p>The teaspoon, after-dinner coffee spoon, and demitasse spoon are placed on the saucer behind the cup handle. The spoon handle faces the diner in a four o’clock position, ready for use. But when a teaspoon is used as an eating utensil, such as cereal at breakfast, it is laid on the right side of the place setting.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-smallest-measuring-spoon>What is the smallest measuring spoon?</h2>
<p>You can buy mini measuring spoons based around two different measurement systems: Most are extensions of the teaspoon system and come in amounts like 1/8 tsp, 1/16 tsp, 1/32tsp, and 1/64 tsp. These spoons are usually labelled with cutesy names like “tad”, “dash”, “nip”, “smidgen”, and “drop”.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-knives-forks-and-spoons-made>How are knives, forks, and spoons made?</h2>
<p>How are knives, forks, and spoons made? In this video from The Magic of Making, we go behind-the-scenes with the workers and machines that cut, stamp, bend, sharpen, and polish silverware into its final forms. We love seeing how things are made.</p>

<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-store-forks-and-spoons>What’s the best way to store forks and spoons?</h2>
<p>Use buckets for storing forks and spoons to hang them. Purchase matching metal, plastic, or wooden buckets that are wide enough to store your utensils in. After you’ve placed spoons in one bucket and forks in another, choose to hang them on a metal rod or put each one on its own separate hook.</p>
