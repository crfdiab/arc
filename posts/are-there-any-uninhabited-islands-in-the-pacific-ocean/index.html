<h2 id=are-there-any-uninhabited-islands-in-the-pacific-ocean>Are there any uninhabited islands in the Pacific Ocean?</h2>
<p>Sadly, the story of a paradise lost is only too true on Henderson Island. The tiny island, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, is completely uninhabited by humans, and hidden away in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-undiscovered-islands-in-the-pacific>Are there any undiscovered islands in the Pacific?</h2>
<p>Originally Answered: Are there any undiscovered islands left on earth? There are none at present, but you can hope for the future. New islands have developed, where none previously were, as a result of volcanic activity, as a result of shifting seabeds, as the result of the movement of tectonic plates.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-an-island-where-nobody-lives>Is there an island where nobody lives?</h2>
<p>A tiny island in the South Pacific ocean has been found to have the highest density of anthropogenic (made by humans) debris anywhere in the world. Yet Henderson Island, the largest of four islands in the Pitcairn Island group, has a human population of zero!</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-uninhabited-islands-in-the-pacific>Are there any uninhabited islands in the Pacific?</h2>
<p>One of the famous and biggest uninhabited islands in the Pacific, Clipperton is spread over a six sq. km. area south-west of Central America. The island is considered a French territory and its ownership has been transferred amongst French, Americans, Mexicans a lot in the last two centuries.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-deserted-islands-in-the-world>Are there any deserted islands in the world?</h2>
<p>Quite a few. Some of the smaller islands off the coasts of Ireland and Scotland were deserted -abandoned by their inhabitants – fairly recently. The best known is probably Hirta – St. Kilda – though that may not be technically deserted, as there is a military base there.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-largest-south-pacific-island>What is the largest South Pacific Island?</h2>
<p>Part of the Solomon Islands, Tetepare is the largest uninhabited island in the South Pacific. The long rugged island is covered with pristine lowland rainforest and fringed with coral reefs. The island’s original inhabitants lived in scattered villages throughout the island and spoke a distinct language.</p>
