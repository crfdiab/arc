<h2 id=what-was-the-economic-activity-of-the-new-england-colonies>What was the economic activity of the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>The main economic activities of the New England Colonies were logging, whaling, and fishing.</p>
<h2 id=what-led-to-new-england-colonies-having-trade-as-an-economic-activity>What led to New England colonies having trade as an economic activity?</h2>
<p>The geography and climate impacted the trade and economic activities of New England Colonies. In the New England towns along the coast, the colonists made their living fishing, whaling, and shipbuilding. The fish included cod, mackerel, herring, halibut, hake, bass and sturgeon. See Triangular Trade.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-economic-activities-of-the-new-england-colonies-and-why>What were the economic activities of the New England colonies and why?</h2>
<p>Fishing (especially codfish) was most important to the New England economy, though whaling, trapping, shipbuilding, and logging were important also. Eventually, many New England shippers grew wealthy buying slaves from West Africa in return for rum, and selling the slaves to the West Indies in return for molasses.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-industries-did-the-new-england-colonies-have>What type of industries did the New England Colonies have?</h2>
<p>Major industries in the New England Colonies included lumber, whaling, shipbuilding, fishing, livestock, textiles, and some agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-some-of-the-new-england-merchants-became-very-wealthy>How did some of the New England Merchants became very wealthy?</h2>
<p>Many merchants became wealthy by providing goods to the agricultural population; many of this group came to dominate the society of seaport cities. Unlike the life of yeoman farm households, these merchants lived lives that resembled those of the upper classes in England.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-economic-activities-of-the-new-england-colonies>What are the economic activities of the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>Economic Activities – New England Colonies. 1 Some small farms. 2 Fishing. 3 Lumbering in some areas. 4 Ship Building. 5 Plantation. 6 Tobacco, rice, and indigo farms. 7</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-economic-pattern-of-the-southern-colonies>What was the economic pattern of the southern colonies?</h2>
<p>Economic patterns in the mid-Atlantic region were similar to those in New England, with some variations for the ethnic origins of various immigrant communities. While the Southern Colonies were mainly dominated by the wealthy planters, many small subsistence farms were family owned and operated.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-society-like-in-the-middle-colonies>What was the society like in the Middle Colonies?</h2>
<p>Middle Colonies. As in New England, the majority of the elite in the Middle Colonies were merchants. Merchants dominated urban society; about 40 merchants controlled half of Philadelphia ‘s trade. Wealthy merchants in Philadelphia and New York, like their counterparts in New England, built elegant Georgian-style mansions.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-consumer-revolution-affect-the-colonies>How did the consumer revolution affect the colonies?</h2>
<p>An increased supply of consumer goods from England that became available in the 18th century led to a phenomenon called the “Consumer Revolution.” In New England, high-level politicians gave out plots of land to male settlers, or proprietors, who then divided the land among themselves.</p>
