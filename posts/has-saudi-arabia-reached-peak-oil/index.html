<h2 id=has-saudi-arabia-reached-peak-oil>Has Saudi Arabia reached peak oil?</h2>
<p>Using the stated number of 267 Gbbl, past production amounts to 40% of the stated remaining proved reserves. As of 2016, Saudi Arabia cumulative oil production reached 143.97 bbl. The previous peak was in August 2013 at 10.2 million barrels per day.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-saudi-arabias-oil-peak>When did Saudi Arabia’s oil peak?</h2>
<p>According to the cables, which date between 2007-09, Husseini said Saudi Arabia might reach an output of 12 million barrels a day in 10 years but before then — possibly as early as 2012 — global oil production would have hit its highest point. This crunch point is known as “peak oil“.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-oil-found-in-saudi-arabia>Where is oil found in Saudi Arabia?</h2>
<p>Dharan Oil Fields. A massive oil pipeline carries petroleum from Dharan, Saudi Arabia, near where oil was first discovered in the country. Today, oil accounts for more than 90% of Saudi Arabia’s budget revenue.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-we-reach-peak-oil>What happens if we reach peak oil?</h2>
<p>Peak oil is a hypothetical scenario where oil production hits a maximum rate and begins a decline. When peak oil is reached, the discovery of new reserves cannot keep pace with the decline in existing reserves.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-oil-field-in-saudi-arabia>Which is the largest oil field in Saudi Arabia?</h2>
<p>According to Bloomberg, the giant Ghawar oil field in Saudi Arabia is “fading faster than anyone guessed.” Last year, Saudi Aramco oil company published financial figures, revealing that Ghawar’s historic production has declined by 24% in six years.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-oil-production-declining-in-saudi-arabia>How is oil production declining in Saudi Arabia?</h2>
<p>Last year, Saudi Aramco oil company published financial figures, revealing that Ghawar’s historic production has declined by 24% in six years. Aramco reports a natural decline rate of 8%, which means their production would fall by half in less than nine years, without investing billions annually into new wells and new technology on marginal sites.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-peak-of-oil-production-in-the-world>When was the peak of oil production in the world?</h2>
<p>However, recent production data suggests that the all-time peak production may have already occurred. Ron Patterson, a computer engineer, who worked with Saudi Aramco oil company, suggests that the all-time peak may prove to be November 2018, when the world was producing oil at a rate of 84.7 million barrels per day (mb/d).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-saudi-arabia-important-to-the-world>Why is Saudi Arabia important to the world?</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has traditionally been regarded as the world’s most important swing producer of oil. When acting as such, the Saudi government would increase or decrease oil production to maintain a more stable price.</p>
