<h2 id=what-is-the-southeast-corner-of-missouri>What is the southeast corner of Missouri?</h2>
<p>The Missouri bootheel forms the southeast corner of the state. It is a tag of land about thirty-seven miles wide that hangs down approximately 34.5 miles from the state’s otherwise straight southern boundary line.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-missouri-have-the-boot-heel>Why does Missouri have the boot heel?</h2>
<p>The inclusion of the “bootheel” in the boundaries of Missouri has been credited to John Hardeman Walker, a landowner and influential citizen of southeast Missouri. Walker and the people of Little Prairie realized this line would place their lands some twenty-five miles south of the Missouri border.</p>
<h2 id=does-missouri-have-a-panhandle>Does Missouri have a panhandle?</h2>
<p>It’s the only county in Missouri with a panhandle. The panhandle consists of Polk and Lincoln township; it’s seven miles north-to-south and 15 miles east-to-west.</p>
<h2 id=what-part-of-missouri-is-considered-little-dixie>What part of Missouri is considered little Dixie?</h2>

<h2 id=how-did-missouri-get-its-boot>How did Missouri get its boot?</h2>
<p>It was the Louisiana Purchase of 1803-1804 which formally brought Missouri’s land into the United States. On March 9-10, 1804, Three Flags Day was observed in St. Louis during which the Spanish flag was raised and lowered, then the French and finally the Stars and Stripes hoisted and kept flying.</p>

<h2 id=where-is-the-bootheel-in-the-state-of-missouri>Where is the Bootheel in the state of Missouri?</h2>
<p>The Missouri Bootheel is the southeasternmost part of the state of Missouri, extending south of 36°30’ north latitude, so called because its shape in relation to the rest of the state resembles the heel of a boot. Strictly speaking, it is composed of the counties of Dunklin, New Madrid, and Pemiscot.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-boundary-between-kansas-and-missouri>Where is the boundary between Kansas and Missouri?</h2>
