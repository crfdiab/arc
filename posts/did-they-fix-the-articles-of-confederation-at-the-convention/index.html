<p>This became the Constitutional Convention. It was quickly agreed that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced. On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the Constitution….Ratification.</p>

<h2 id=why-did-they-have-a-convention-over-the-articles-of-confederation>Why did they have a convention over the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>The Constitutional Convention of 1787 was called to revise the ailing Articles of Confederation. Nine states had to approve the Constitution before it could go into effect. After a long and often bitter debate, eleven states ratified the Constitution, which instituted a new form of government for the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-convention-was-the-articles-of-confederation>What convention was the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>The Constitutional Convention<br>
The Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia met between May and September of 1787 to address the problems of the weak central government that existed under the Articles of Confederation.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-articles-of-confederation-written-and-ratified>When was the Articles of Confederation written and ratified?</h2>
<p>The Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation, the first constitution of the United States, on November 15, 1777. However, ratification of the Articles of Confederation by all thirteen states did not occur until March 1, 1781.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-articles-of-confederation-help-the-states>How did the Articles of Confederation help the States?</h2>
<p>To avoid any perception of “taxation without representation,” the Articles of Confederation allowed only state governments to levy taxes. To pay for its expenses, the national government had to request money from the states. The states, however, were often negligent in this duty, and so the national government was underfunded.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-articles-of-confederation-replaced-by-the-us-constitution>When was the Articles of Confederation replaced by the US Constitution?</h2>
<p>First constitution for the United States; replaced by the current United States Constitution on March 4, 1789. The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union was an agreement among the 13 original states of the United States of America that served as its first constitution.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-articles-of-confederation-fail-to-work>Why did the Articles of Confederation fail to work?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the Articles of Confederation failed because they were crafted to keep the national government as weak as possible: 1 There was no power to enforce laws 2 No judicial branch or national courts 3 Amendments needed to have a unanimous vote</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-only-person-to-sign-the-articles-of-confederation>Who was the only person to sign the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>Roger Sherman (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the Continental Association, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.</p>
