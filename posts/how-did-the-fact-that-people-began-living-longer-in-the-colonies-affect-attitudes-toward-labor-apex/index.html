<p>How did the fact that people began living longer in colonies effect attitudes toward labor ? It increased the value of owning slaves over hiring indentured servants. They said that people who weren’t Christians could be slaves. You just studied 7 terms!</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonies-switch-from-indentured-servants-to-slavery>Why did the colonies switch from indentured servants to slavery?</h2>
<p>Many landowners also felt threatened by newly freed servants demand for land. The colonial elite realized the problems of indentured servitude. Landowners turned to African slaves as a more profitable and ever-renewable source of labor and the shift from indentured servants to racial slavery had begun.</p>

<h2 id=why-were-slaves-in-virginia-better-off-than-those-in-the-caribbean>Why were slaves in Virginia better off than those in the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>Slaves in Virginia were better off than those in the Caribbean because there was enough land to grow food as well as cash crops. Landowners also provide slaves vegetable gardens which supply additional fresh produce for consumption. Morning meals were also in the slaves’ cabins.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-industrial-revolution-affect-peoples-lives>How did the Industrial Revolution affect people’s lives?</h2>
<p>It made peoples life much easier. Industrial revolution refers to the rapid developments that took place in technology and industry during 18th and 19th centuries. The term refers to these changes as well as the period. Industrial revolution led to many deep rooted changes in the way people lived and worked.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-revolution-start-in-the-colonies>How did the revolution start in the colonies?</h2>
<p>The Revolution Begins In the early 1770s, more and more colonists became convinced that Parliament intended to take away their freedom. In fact, the Americans saw a pattern of increasing oppression and corruption happening all around the world. Parliament was determined to bring its unruly American subjects to heel.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-colonial-era-affect-latin-america>How did the colonial era affect Latin America?</h2>
<p>The lone exception was Peru, where some Inca nobility managed to hold onto wealth and influence for a time, but as the years went on, even their privileges were eroded into nothing. The loss of the upper classes contributed directly to the marginalization of native populationsas a whole.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-colonist-wipe-out-the-native-population>How did the colonist wipe out the native population?</h2>
<p>That’s just around Mexico City. Native populations on Cuba and Hispaniola were all but wiped out, and every native population in the New World suffered some loss. Although the bloody conquest took its toll, the main culprits were diseases like smallpox.</p>
