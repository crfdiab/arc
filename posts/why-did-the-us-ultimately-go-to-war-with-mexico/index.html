<h2 id=why-did-the-us-ultimately-go-to-war-with-mexico>Why did the US ultimately go to war with Mexico?</h2>
<p>From 1846 to 1848, U.S. and Mexican troops fought against one another in the Mexican-American War. Ultimately, it was a battle for land where Mexico was fighting to keep what they thought was their property and the U.S. desired to retain the disputed land of Texas and obtain more of Mexico’s northern lands.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-source-of-the-conflict-between-the-united-states-and-mexico-before-they-went-to-war-quizlet>What was the source of the conflict between the United States and Mexico before they went to war quizlet?</h2>
<p>What was the source of the conflict between the United States and Mexico before they went to war? President Polk considered California a part of Manifest Destiny, even though it belonged to Mexico. He tried to buy it, but Mexico would not sell.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-mexican-american-war>What was the result of the Mexican American War?</h2>
<p>CONSEQUENCES OF THE MEXICAN-AMERICAN WAR: 1. The United States acquired the northern half of Mexico. This area later became the U.S. states of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. 2. President Santa Anna lost power in Mexico following the war.</p>
<h2 id=what-future-president-fought-in-the-mexican-american-war>What future president fought in the Mexican-American War?</h2>
<p>The Mexican-American War made the reputations of future US Presidents. Ulysses S. Grant, Zachary Taylor, and Franklin Pierce all fought in the war, and James Buchanan was Polk’s Secretary of State during the war.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-us-declare-war-on-mexico>When did the US declare war on Mexico?</h2>
<p>On May 13, 1846, the United States declared war on Mexico. Following the capture of Mexico City in September 1847, Nicholas Trist, chief clerk of the Department of State and Polk’s peace emissary, began negotiations for a peace treaty with the Mexican Government under terms similar to those pursued by Slidell the previous year.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-us-army-fight-in-the-mexican-american-war>Where did the US Army fight in the Mexican American War?</h2>
<p>The U.S. army fought their way overland into Mexico from California, Texas, and eventually from Veracruz straight to the capitol. Mexico’s Santa Anna, back in power again, sent a peace treaty to Washington in early 1847, but his terms were not approved.</p>
