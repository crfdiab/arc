<h2 id=how-many-people-were-left-homeless-in-the-san-francisco-earthquake>How many people were left homeless in the San Francisco earthquake?</h2>
<p>400,000 residents<br>
Despite a quick response from San Francisco’s large military population, the city was devastated. The earthquake and fires killed an estimated 3,000 people and left half of the city’s 400,000 residents homeless.</p>
<h2 id=what-buildings-survived-the-1906-san-francisco-earthquake>What buildings survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake?</h2>
<p>The Flood Building was one of the few buildings to survive the 1906 earthquake and subsequent fire in downtown San Francisco (Old St. Mary’s Cathedral being another). “The Baldwin Hotel & Theater (owned by historical figure “Lucky” Baldwin) occupied the site of today’s Flood Building.</p>

<p>Shaking damage, however, was equally severe in many other places along the fault rupture. The frequently quoted value of 700 deaths caused by the earthquake and fire is now believed to underestimate the total loss of life by a factor of 3 or 4. Most of the fatalities occurred in San Francisco, and 189 were reported elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-san-francisco-fire-department-respond-to-the-earthquake>How did the San Francisco fire department respond to the earthquake?</h2>
<p>Leaking gas was the catalyst for fires that quickly spread throughout the city and the lack of water made fire fighting a challenge. Approximately one hour after the earthquake, the San Francisco Fire Department sent a messenger to the Presidio to request an artillery division to assist with the containment of fires.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-was-the-1989-san-francisco-earthquake>How long was the 1989 San Francisco earthquake?</h2>
<p>How long was the 1989 earthquake in San Francisco? Caused by a slip along the San Andreas Fault, the quake lasted 10– 15 seconds and measured 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale, or 6.9 on the open-ended Richter Scale. The quake killed 63 people throughout northern California, injured 3,757 and left some 3,000-12,000 people homeless.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-san-francisco-before-the-1906-earthquake>What was the population of San Francisco before the 1906 earthquake?</h2>
<p>Newman, who survived San Francisco’s 1906 earthquake, died in July 2015 at the age of 113. Before the quake, San Francisco was known as the “Queen of the West.” It was “The” city on the West Coast, a bustling metropolis of 400,000 people.</p>
