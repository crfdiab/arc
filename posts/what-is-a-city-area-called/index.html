<h2 id=what-is-a-city-area-called>What is a city area called?</h2>
<p>An urban area, or built-up area, is a human settlement with a high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-cities-grow-and-spread-to-surrounding-areas>What is it called when cities grow and spread to surrounding areas?</h2>
<p>Urban sprawl, also called sprawl or suburban sprawl, the rapid expansion of the geographic extent of cities and towns, often characterized by low-density residential housing, single-use zoning, and increased reliance on the private automobile for transportation.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-cities-described-as>What are cities described as?</h2>
<p>It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks. Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, and communication.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-define-rural-and-urban-areas>How do you define rural and urban areas?</h2>
<p>According to the current delineation, released in 2012 and based on the 2010 decennial census, rural areas comprise open country and settlements with fewer than 2,500 residents. Urban areas comprise larger places and densely settled areas around them. Urban areas do not necessarily follow municipal boundaries.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-cities-need-each-other-called>What are two cities need each other called?</h2>
<p>In most cases, a conurbation is a polycentric urbanised area, in which transportation has developed to link areas to create a single urban labour market or travel to work area. Patrick Geddes coined the term in his book Cities In Evolution (1915).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-characteristics-of-rural-areas>What are the characteristics of rural areas?</h2>
<p>A rural area is an open swath of land that has few homes or other buildings, and not very many people. A rural areas population density is very low. Many people live in a city, or urban area. Their homes and businesses are located very close to one another.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-city-different-from-other-cities>What makes a city different from other cities?</h2>
<p>According to the “functional definition” a city is not distinguished by size alone, but also by the role it plays within a larger political context. Cities serve as administrative, commercial, religious, and cultural hubs for their larger surrounding areas.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-populated-city-in-the-world>Which is the most populated city in the world?</h2>
<p>The most populated city proper is Chongqing while the most populous metropolitan areas are the Greater Tokyo Area, the Shanghai area, and Jakarta metropolitan area. The cities of Faiyum, Damascus, and Varanasi are among those laying claim to longest continual inhabitation.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-a-civilization-that-live-in-a-city>What do you call a civilization that live in a city?</h2>
<p>Societies that live in cities are often called civilizations . The word city and the related civilization come from the Latin root civitas, originally meaning ‘citizenship’ or ‘community member’ and eventually coming to correspond with urbs, meaning ‘city’ in a more physical sense.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-important-characteristic-of-a-city>Which is an important characteristic of a city?</h2>
<p>Other important traits of cities besides population include the capital status and relative continued occupation of the city. For example, country capitals such as Abu Dhabi, Beijing, Berlin, Cairo, Dubai, London, Moscow, Paris, Rome, Seoul, Tokyo, and Washington D.C. reflect their nation’s identity.</p>
