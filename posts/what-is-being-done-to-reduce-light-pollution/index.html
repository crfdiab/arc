<h2 id=what-is-being-done-to-reduce-light-pollution>What is being done to reduce light pollution?</h2>
<p>Preventive measures are essential and have to be taken whenever possible to reduce light pollution. Examples include the use of glare-free bulbs, installing low hanging bulbs, having the lights facing downwards, and covering the bulbs to reduce bright skies at night.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-singapore-reduce-light-pollution>How can Singapore reduce light pollution?</h2>
<p>Motion sensors or timers, correct light shielding so the lights point downwards – which also reduces glare – and placing lights low on walkways are all steps to improve outside lighting.</p>
<h2 id=do-led-lights-reduce-light-pollution>Do LED lights reduce light pollution?</h2>
<p>Outdoor LED lighting now not only reduces light pollution but also saves users money and reduces energy. Initially, LED street lights reduced power consumption by 40 to 60 percent. After the lights were reengineered to reduce light pollution, energy savings jumped another 10 to 50 percent.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-light-polluted-city>What is the most light polluted city?</h2>
<p>Light pollution in Hong Kong was declared the ‘worst on the planet’ in March 2013. In June 2016, it was estimated that one third of the world’s population could no longer see the Milky Way, including 80% of Americans and 60% of Europeans. Singapore was found to be the most light-polluted country in the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-led-lights-bad-for-the-environment>Why are LED lights bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>A study published in late 2010 in the journal Environmental Science and Technology found that LEDs contain lead, arsenic and a dozen other potentially dangerous substances. And the copper found in some LEDs can pose an environmental threat if it accumulates in rivers and lakes where it can poison aquatic life.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-led-lights-affect-the-environment>How do LED lights affect the environment?</h2>
<p>Due to their low energy consumption, LED luminaires contribute the least amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere of all lighting sources. For example, use of a simple incandescent bulb results in 4,500 pounds of CO2 annually, while LED bulbs contribute only 451 pounds of CO2 per year.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-reduce-light-pollution>What’s the best way to reduce light pollution?</h2>
<p>The cheapest, most obvious and most effective way to reduce light pollution is to start turning things off. While there’s a time and place for outdoor lighting — illuminating after dark activities, for instance — many of us burn porch and spot lighting because it gives us a sense of security.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-get-rid-of-too-light-highlights>How to get rid of too light highlights?</h2>
<p>1 Spray a colored dry shampoo over your hair for a quick fix. 2 Wash your brassy-colored hair with a clarifying shampoo once a week. 3 Use dish soap to fade your brassy highlights. 4 Apply purple shampoo to your hair to correct the brassy tone. 5 Take precautions to avoid too-light highlights in the future.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-i-do-to-reduce-my-exposure-to-blue-light>What can I do to reduce my exposure to blue light?</h2>
<p>As for blue light filtering apps, you can consider Blue Light Filter for Eye Care or Twilight, among others. You always have the option of buying a screen cover for your laptop as an option for filtering out blue light.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-led-bulbs-helping-to-reduce-light-pollution>How are LED bulbs helping to reduce light pollution?</h2>
<p>LED bulbs save money and electricity but researchers say they may put off more light pollution than traditional bulbs. A study out of the GFZ German Research Centre for Geoscience led by Christopher Kyba and published in Science Advances found that light radiating from Earth at night has increased by 2% every year over the past four years.</p>
