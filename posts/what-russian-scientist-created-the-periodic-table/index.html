<p>Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev<br>
Dmitri Mendeleev, Russian in full Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev, (born January 27 (February 8, New Style), 1834, Tobolsk, Siberia, Russian Empire—died January 20 (February 2), 1907, St. Petersburg, Russia), Russian chemist who developed the periodic classification of the elements.</p>

<p>chemist Dmitrii Mendeleev<br>
150 years ago, Mendeleev perceived the relationships of the chemical elements. REVOLUTIONARY Russian chemist Dmitrii Mendeleev (shown around 1880) was the first to publish a periodic table, which put the known elements into a logical order and left room for elements not yet discovered.</p>

<p>Ivan Pavlovich Mendeleev<br>
Mendeleev was born on 8th February 1834 in Verhnie Aremzyani village, near Tobolsk in Russian Empire. His father, Ivan Pavlovich Mendeleev was a teacher at several schools. In 1820s he returned to Tobolsk (Siberia) to serve as the director of gymnasium.</p>

<p>chemist Dmitri Mendeleev<br>
In 1869, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev created the framework that became the modern periodic table, leaving gaps for elements that were yet to be discovered.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-dmitri-mendeleev-arrange-the-elements-on-the-periodic-table>How did Dmitri Mendeleev arrange the elements on the periodic table?</h2>
<p>Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev arranged the elements by atomic mass, corresponding to relative molar mass. It is sometimes said that he played “chemical solitaire” on long train journeys, using cards with various facts about the known elements.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-version-of-the-periodic-table-published>When was the first version of the periodic table published?</h2>
<p>In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, classified elements into six families by their valence—for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-joseph-meyer-come-up-with-the-periodic-table>When did Joseph Meyer come up with the periodic table?</h2>
<p>In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group.</p>
