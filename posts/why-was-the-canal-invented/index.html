<h2 id=why-was-the-canal-invented>Why was the canal invented?</h2>
<p>Canals were needed for the Industrial Revolution which was creating huge amounts of heavy produce which had to be moved. Canals were the answer to moving heavy objects large distances. Canals were man-made rivers which were deep enough to cope with barges which were capable of moving nearly forty tonnes of weight.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-canal-used>Why is canal used?</h2>
<p>A canal is a man-made waterway. Canals are built for a variety of uses including irrigation, land drainage, urban water supply, hydroelectric power generation, and transportation of cargo and people. To conserve water and to facilitate two-way travel, canals are built level.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-canals-built-in-america>Why were canals built in America?</h2>
<p>In the late 18th and early 19th century, the construction of canals was being considered to improve inland transportation in North America, which was limited to trails and coastal navigation.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-purpose-of-the-first-canals-built-in-britain>What was the main purpose of the first canals built in Britain?</h2>
<p>Roman Canals Canals were first developed in Britain as an irrigation and drainage resource. They often ran between natural water sources as a way of providing water to areas which were naturally drier. These canals also helped to increase the amount of clean water that was available in larger towns and cities.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-oldest-canal-in-the-world>Which is oldest canal in the world?</h2>
<p>Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal<br>
The world’s oldest and longest man-made waterway is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Covering more than 1,100 miles and 2,500 years of history, the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal connects five of the major rivers in China.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-canal-so-successful-in-the-18th-century>Why was the canal so successful in the 18th century?</h2>
<p>The 18th Century saw a surge in canal building and the dawn of a new ‘Canal Age’. Canal historian Mike Clarke explains why some canals were very successful and others were doomed to fail. Before 1700, most British inland waterways had been built by aristocratic landowners to carry agricultural products in southern England.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-british-government-nationalise-the-canals>When did the British government nationalise the canals?</h2>
<p>After years of neglect and the damage caused by the World War II, Britain’s canal and railway systems were nationalised by the government in 1947. The 1950’s and 1960’s saw a resurgence in the use of canals mainly for leisure purposes, and the Inland Waterways Association was formed to promote their rescue.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-canals-in-amsterdam>What was the purpose of the canals in Amsterdam?</h2>
<p>Amsterdam was created with canals of concentric circles facing the IJ Bay in the seventeenth century. Three canals were designed with residential development in mind. The fourth outermost one was created for defense as well as excess water management.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-backbone-of-the-erie-canal>Who was the backbone of the Erie Canal?</h2>
<p>To say that the Irish built the Erie Canal is an exaggeration, since there were British and Germans who worked alongside them, but to say that they were the backbone of the Erie Canal is entirely fair, with over 3,000 Irish immigrants hired on to dig trenches, four feet deep, seven feet wide.</p>
