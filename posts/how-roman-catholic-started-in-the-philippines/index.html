<h2 id=how-roman-catholic-started-in-the-philippines>How Roman Catholic started in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>The Philippines’ Catholic majority has its origins in the islands’ long period as a Spanish colony, and popes have made the more than 6,000-mile trip from the Vatican a few times before. Pope Paul VI visited the country in 1970, and St. John Paul II traveled to the Philippines twice as pope (in 1981 and 1995).</p>
<h2 id=who-introduced-the-roman-catholic>Who introduced the Roman Catholic?</h2>
<p>Pope Leo I, also known as Leo the Great. Pope Gregory I (reigned 590–604), more than any pope before or after him, laid the foundations for the Roman Catholicism of the Middle Ages.</p>
<h2 id=who-brought-roman-catholicism-to-the-americas>Who brought Roman Catholicism to the Americas?</h2>
<p>Iberians introduced Roman Catholicism to “Latin America” when Spain and Portugal conquered and colonized their respective New World empires after 1500.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-spanish-explorer-who-brought-catholicism-to-the-philippines>Who was the Spanish explorer who brought Catholicism to the Philippines?</h2>
<p>It was only later in the 16th century that the voyages of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan (1480-1521) first brought Catholicism to the archipelago, originally named St. Lazarus’ Islands by Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos (1500? – 1544), but later changed to the present name in honor of Philip II of Spain who reigned from 1556-1598.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-christianity-first-come-to-the-philippines>When did Christianity first come to the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Christianity was first brought to the Philippine islands by Spanish missionaries and colonists, who arrived in waves beginning in the early 16th century in Cebu. Compared to the Spanish Era, when Christianity was recognized as the state religion, the faith today is practiced in the context of a secular state.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-catholic-bishops-in-the-philippines>Who are the Catholic bishops in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>The episcopal conference responsible in governing the faith is the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines . Christianity was first brought to the Philippine islands by Spanish missionaries and colonists, who arrived in waves beginning in the early 16th century in Cebu.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-catholicism-so-successful-in-the-philippines>Why was Catholicism so successful in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>In little more than a century, most lowland Filipinos were converted to Roman Catholicism. There are a number of reasons why Spanish missionaries were successful in this attempt: 1. Mass baptism – the initial practice of baptizing large numbers of Filipinos at one time enabled the initial conversion to Christianity.</p>
