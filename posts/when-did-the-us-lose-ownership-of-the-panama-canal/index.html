<h2 id=when-did-the-us-lose-ownership-of-the-panama-canal>When did the US lose ownership of the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>December 31, 1999<br>
On December 31, 1999, the United States, in accordance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, officially hands over control of the Panama Canal, putting the strategic waterway into Panamanian hands for the first time.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-decided-about-the-ownership-of-the-panama-canal>What was decided about the ownership of the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>Signed on September 7, 1977, the treaty recognized Panama as the territorial sovereign in the Canal Zone but gave the United States the right to continue operating the canal until December 31, 1999. Despite considerable opposition in the U.S. Senate, the treaty was approved by a one-vote margin in September 1978.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-owner-of-the-panama-canal>Who is the owner of the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>The canal has come a long way since the time it was built to being at the center of ownership tussles between the United States and Panama. Today, the canal is managed by the Panama Canal Authority and continues to shape international trade and relations.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-has-the-panama-canal-been-under-us-control>How long has the Panama Canal been under US control?</h2>
<p>For more than 100 years, the Panama Canal has controlled the bulk of goods transferred between the Pacific and the Atlantic. For much of that history, this monumental feat of engineering was under the control of the United States.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-port-in-the-panama-canal>Which is the largest port in the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>China Buys Panama’s Largest Port. For more than 100 years, the Panama Canal has controlled the bulk of goods transferred between the Pacific and the Atlantic. For much of that history, this monumental feat of engineering was under the control of the United States. But this is no longer the case.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-ship-to-cross-the-panama-canal>Who was the first ship to cross the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>The Panama Canal was controlled by the U.S. until 1999 when it was transferred to Panamanian ownership. The first ship to cross the Panama Canal was the Ancon. The Panama Canal generates nearly a third of the country’s revenue. 121 million cubic feet of concrete went into making the locks and dams in the canal.</p>
