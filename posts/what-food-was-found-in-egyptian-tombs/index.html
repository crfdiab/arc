<p>Wealthier Egyptians could afford to be buried with jewelry, furniture, and other valuables, which made them targets of tomb robbers.

<p>The burial chamber contains Tutankhamun’s sarcophagus and coffin. Its walls are painted with scenes of Tutankhamun in the afterworld – the ritual of “opening the mouth” to give life to the deceased, the solar bark on which one travels to the afterworld, and Tutankhamun’s ka in the presence of Osiris.</p>

<p>As ancient Egyptian rulers, pharaohs were both the heads of state and the religious leaders of their people. The word “pharaoh” means “Great House,” a reference to the palace where the pharaoh resides. After their deaths, many pharaohs were entombed and surrounded by riches they were meant to use in the afterlife.</p>

<p>Later, those who had died were buried in coffins to protect from animals in the wild, but it soon became apparent that bodies, also protected from the heat and the dry sand, were not preserved properly.
