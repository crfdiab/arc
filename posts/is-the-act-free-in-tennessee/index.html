<h2 id=is-the-act-free-in-tennessee>Is the ACT free in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>ACT 2020-2021 Test Dates Seniors will have an opportunity to test for FREE in the fall semester. Juniors will have an opportunity to test for FREE in the spring semester.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-credits-do-you-have-to-have-to-graduate-in-tn>How many credits do you have to have to graduate in TN?</h2>
<p>22 credits<br>
The Tennessee Department of Education sets graduation requirements that best prepare students for opportunities to be successful in their post K-12 experience whether they choose college, career institutes, or immediate transition to the work force. At present, high school students must complete 22 credits to graduate.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-math-credits-do-you-need-to-graduate-in-tennessee>How many math credits do you need to graduate in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>4 credits<br>
What Math and Science Credits are Needed? Students in Tennessee are required to take 4 credits of math, including algebra I, algebra II, and geometry, or their deemed equivalents in integrated math I, II, and III. The fourth credit may be chosen by the student, but must be at the level of algebra I or above.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-graduate-early-from-high-school-in-tennessee>Can you graduate early from high school in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>The Tennessee State Board of Education (SBE) High School Policy 2.103(1)(e) states, “A public high school student may complete an early high school graduation program and be eligible for unconditional entry into a public two-year institution of higher education or conditional entry into a public four-year institution …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-act-score-in-tn>What is the average ACT score in TN?</h2>
<p>19.9<br>
A total of 62,564 students among the class of 2020, or 97% of eligible students, scored an average composite of 19.9 on the ACT, according to data released Friday by the Tennessee Department of Education.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-take-the-act-in-tennessee>How much does it cost to take the ACT in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>ACT Test Options and Prices</p>
<table><tr><th></th><th>Fee</th></tr><tr><td>The full ACT (no writing)</td><td>$60.00</td></tr><tr><td>The full ACT with writing</td><td>$85.00</td></tr><tr><td>Test option change</td><td>$25.00</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=can-you-fail-8th-grade-in-tennessee>Can you fail 8th grade in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>A typical 8th grade public school student is 13 or 14 years old. But in thousands of cases each year in Tennessee, 8th grade students do not earn enough credits to move on to 9th grade.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-okay-to-graduate-high-school-at-19>Is it okay to graduate high school at 19?</h2>
<p>It is certainly OK to graduate from high school at age 19. That isn’t unusual, especially if your parents “red-shirted” you from kindergarten. “Red shirting” is holding a student back so they will be more physically (and perhaps emotionally) mature than some of their classmates.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-volunteer-hours-do-you-need-to-graduate-high-school-in-tennessee>How many volunteer hours do you need to graduate high school in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>100 hours<br>
Students are required to complete 100 hours of volunteer community service to graduate. The specific community service projects are established by the local education agency. Districts may award up to one-half elective credit for student completion of nonpaid voluntary community or school service work.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-students-have-to-take-act-in-tennessee>When do students have to take act in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>Beginning with the graduating class of 2018, students enrolled in Tennessee public schools during their eleventh grade year must complete the ACT or SAT prior to graduation (see High School Policy 2.103 ). The ACT assesses students’ cumulative knowledge and skills based on standards taught from elementary to high school.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-get-a-high-school-diploma-in-tennessee>How to get a high school diploma in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>To receive a regular high school diploma, all students enrolled in a Tennessee public school during their eleventh (11) grade year must take either the ACT or SAT.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-states-require-students-to-take-the-act>How many states require students to take the Act?</h2>
<p>Of the 12 states that administer the ACT statewide, more than half include the writing (the rest do not). There are also a few states that don’t require the test of all students but allow districts to opt in to the program or give students the choice of which test to take. States that require all students to take the ACT with Writing.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-take-the-sat-or-act>Do you have to take the SAT or act?</h2>
<p>Requiring the ACT or SAT is HOLDING STEADY after a rise in popularity. Twenty-five states require students to take the SAT or ACT, the same number as in 2016 and 2017.</p>
