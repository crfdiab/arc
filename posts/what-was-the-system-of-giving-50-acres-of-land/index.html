<p>The headright system<br>
The headright system referred to a grant of land, usually 50 acres, given to settlers in the 13 colonies. The system was used mainly in Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Maryland. The headright system was originally created in 1618 in Jamestown, Virginia.</p>

<p>A headright refers to a legal grant of land given to settlers during the period of European colonization in the Americas. Headrights are most notable for their role in the expansion of the Thirteen Colonies; the Virginia Company gave headrights to settlers, and the Plymouth Company followed suit.</p>

<p>Virginia and Maryland operated under what was known as the “headright system.” The leaders of each colony knew that labor was essential for economic survival, so they provided incentives for planters to import workers. For each laborer brought across the Atlantic, the master was rewarded with 50 acres of land.</p>

<p>President Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead Act on May 20, 1862. On January 1, 1863, Daniel Freeman made the first claim under the Act, which gave citizens or future citizens up to 160 acres of public land provided they live on it, improve it, and pay a small registration fee.</p>

<p>Those who stayed could work for themselves on their private three-acre plots, rather than serve the company by working full-time on its common land. In 1616, colonists in Virginia (“ancient planters”) were given 50 acres in exchange for remaining rather than returning to England.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-policy-of-the-virginia-colony>What was the policy of the Virginia Colony?</h2>
<p>He embarked on a policy of granting sub-patents to land, which encouraged groups and wealthier individuals to go to Virginia. He sought to reward investors and so distributed 100 acres of land to each adventurer. He also distributed 50 acres to each person who paid his or her own way and 50 acres more for each additional person they brought along.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-colonists-acquire-title-to-land-in-virginia>How did the colonists acquire title to land in Virginia?</h2>
<p>The Europeans who settled first at Jamestown were employees of the Virginia Company. The investors in that company controlled all the initial English land claims in the colony. That lasted less than a decade, after which land titles for individuals were established by company land grants to individuals and “particular plantations.”</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-headright-system-in-the-virginia-colony>What was the headright system in the Virginia Colony?</h2>
<p>The “great charter” of 1618 established the headright system as a reward for immigrating to the colony. All persons going to Virginia with the intent to “inhabitate” were granted 50 acres of land as long as they either remained in Virginia for three years, or died within that time period.</p>
