<h2 id=what-three-middle-colonies-made-up-the-dominion-of-new-england>What three middle colonies made up the Dominion of New England?</h2>
<p>The middle colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware… Had more ethnic diversity than either New England or the southern colonies.</p>
<h2 id=what-made-massachusetts-bay-colony-a-theocracy>What made Massachusetts Bay Colony a theocracy?</h2>
<p>Their government was considered a theocracy because they didn’t separate religion from state, which means they based their government off religious beliefs and values. The witchcraft trial reinforced that the massachusetts bay colony was a theocracy because witchcraft was a devilish sin.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-government-did-the-massachusetts-bay-colony-have>What type of government did the Massachusetts Bay Colony have?</h2>
<p>IN THE 1630S, ENGLISH PURITANS IN MASSACHUSETTS BAY COLONY CRE- ATED A SELF-GOVERNMENT THAT WENT FAR BEYOND WHAT EXISTED IN ENGLAND. SOME HISTORIANS ARGUE THAT IT WAS A RELIGIOUS GOVERNMENT, OR THEOCRACY. OTHERS CLAIM IT WAS A DEMOCRACY.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-a-hardship-for-new-england-colonies>What was a hardship for New England Colonies?</h2>
<p>Notably, for the colonists in Massachusetts Bay and New England, disease was less of a problem than it was in the southern colonies. The cold winters limited travel, and the comparatively small farming communities that were established limited the spread of infection. Death rates dwindled, and life expectancy rose.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-massachusetts-bay-company-settle-in-new-england>When did the Massachusetts Bay Company settle in New England?</h2>
<p>The Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in the 17th century, included parts of Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. The Massachusetts Bay Company founded and successfully settled the colony in 1628.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-permanent-settlement-in-new-england>What was the first permanent settlement in New England?</h2>
<p>New England Colonies. Plymouth Plantation was the first permanent settlement in New England, but beyond that distinction, its place in American history is somewhat exaggerated. Before long, the Pilgrims were eclipsed by the far larger and more important immigration of Non‐Separatist Puritans, who started the Massachusetts Bay colony.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-puritans-settle-in-new-england>Where did the Puritans settle in New England?</h2>
<p>The Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in the 17th century, included parts of Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. The Massachusetts Bay Company founded and successfully settled the colony in 1628. The colonial Puritan leadership exhibited intolerance to other religious views, including Anglican, Quaker, and Baptist theologies.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-new-england-colonies-become-a-colony>When did the New England colonies become a colony?</h2>
<p>New England Colonies. The Pequot War (1636–37) largely wiped out the Pequot tribe and cleared away the last obstacle to the expansion of settlements in the Connecticut River Valley. Despite the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was really without legal status until 1662, when it was chartered as a royal colony.</p>
