<p>The Treaty of Zaragoza, also called the Capitulation of Zaragoza was a peace treaty between Castile and Portugal, signed on 22 April 1529 by King John III of Portugal and the Castilian emperor Charles V, in the Aragonese city of Zaragoza.</p>

<h2 id=what-did-the-treaty-of-tordesillas-provided-the-portuguese-with>What did the Treaty of Tordesillas provided the Portuguese with?</h2>
<p>The 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas neatly divided the “New World” into land, resources, and people claimed by Spain and Portugal. The red vertical line cutting through eastern Brazil represents the divide.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-provision-of-the-treaty-of-zaragoza>What was the main provision of the Treaty of Zaragoza?</h2>
<p>The major provision of the Treaty was that a line of demarcation should be adopted from Pole to Pole, defined by laying off 19° on a bearing NE by E from the Moluccas; beyond this line (which in real terms, then of course not known, gave Portugal about 187° of longitude against Spain’s 173°) the King of Castile should …</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-treaty-between-spain-and-portugal-signed>When was the treaty between Spain and Portugal signed?</h2>
<p>Portugal prevailed, and in 1494 at Tordesillas a bilateral treaty was signed by Spain and Portugal, dividing the earth between them at 270 leagues farther west. [1]</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-line-of-demarcation-between-portugal-and-spain>What was the line of demarcation between Portugal and Spain?</h2>
<p>The Line of Demarcation Created By the Treaty of Tordesillas. With the Treaty of Tordesillas, Portugal and Spain agreed on a line of demarcation which allotted all land to the left of the line to Spain and those to the east under the sovereignty of Portugal.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-french-and-german-treaties-affect-portugal>How did the French and German treaties affect Portugal?</h2>
<p>The French treaty “noted” the Rose Coloured Map, and the German treaty noted Portugal’s claim to territory along the course of the Zambezi linking Angola and Mozambique. The act of “noting” Portuguese claims did not amount to accepting them, only that Portugal had made them.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-portugal-respond-to-the-treaty-of-tordesillas>How did Portugal respond to the Treaty of Tordesillas?</h2>
<p>Portugal objected, and the Treaty of Tordesillas shifted the line of demarcation more than 800 miles to the west. How did the other European powers respond to the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas?</p>
