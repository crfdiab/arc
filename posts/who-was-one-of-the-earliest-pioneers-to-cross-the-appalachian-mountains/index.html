<h2 id=who-was-one-of-the-earliest-pioneers-to-cross-the-appalachian-mountains>Who was one of the earliest pioneers to cross the Appalachian Mountains?</h2>
<p>In 1775, the now-legendary frontiersman Daniel Boone blazed a trail through the Cumberland Gap–a notch in the Appalachian Mountains located near the intersection of Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee–through the interior of Kentucky and to the Ohio River.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-to-take-an-expedition-through-the-appalachians>Who was the first to take an expedition through the Appalachians?</h2>
<p>John Lederer was a 17th-century German physician and an explorer of the Appalachian Mountains. He and the members of his party became the first Europeans to crest the Blue Ridge Mountains (1669) and the first to see the Shenandoah Valley and the Allegheny Mountains beyond.</p>
<h2 id=who-immigrated-to-the-appalachian-mountains>Who immigrated to the Appalachian Mountains?</h2>
<p>Native Americans first began to gather in the Appalachian Mountains some 16,000 years ago. Cherokee Indians were the main Native American group of the Southern Appalachian and Blue Ridge regions, but there were also Iroquois, Powhatan, and Shawnee people.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-settlers-crossed-the-appalachian-mountains-through-the>How did settlers crossed the Appalachian Mountains through the?</h2>
<p>The Braddock Road was the first road to cross the Appalachian Mountain range and to allow for the first time horse-drawn wagons to travel into the West. The later National (or Cumberland) Road followed this old trail west to Cumberland and then branched out toward Wheeling.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-appalachian-mountain-people-settle-in-kentucky>Where did the Appalachian mountain people settle in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>In that order. That is where the mountain people of Kentucky settled after they made the difficult trip to what would become the Commonwealth. As the people came into Kentucky through the Cumberland Gap — from North Carolina and across the mountains from Virginia, they experienced a really arduous journey.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-time-the-appalachian-mountains-were-formed>When was the first time the Appalachian Mountains were formed?</h2>
<p>The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. They once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before experiencing natural erosion.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-people-of-kentucky-come-from>Where did the people of Kentucky come from?</h2>
<p>Kentucky was settled by the people from Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, in that order. As the pioneers made their way over the mountains to the south and east, they most likely lived in cave-like structures along the way, when they could find caves not inhabited by the black bear.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-appalachian-mountains-similar-to-the-rocky-mountains>How are the Appalachian Mountains similar to the Rocky Mountains?</h2>
<p>They once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before experiencing natural erosion. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east–west travel, as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most highways and railroads running east–west.</p>
