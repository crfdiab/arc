<h2 id=what-did-the-kings-do-in-mesopotamia>What did the Kings do in Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>Common Mesopotamians considered the king as the representative of the city’s patron god, the god’s overseer on earth, so to speak. A king was expected to protect his city, to provide law, order and justice and to be a shepherd to the people, ensuring that widows and orphans were cared for.</p>
