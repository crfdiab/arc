<h2 id=is-berlin-the-capital-of-europe>Is Berlin the capital of Europe?</h2>
<p>listen)) is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population. Its 3.8 million inhabitants make it the European Union’s most populous city, according to population within city limits.</p>
<h2 id=is-berlin-different-from-germany>Is Berlin different from Germany?</h2>
<p>Germans from other areas of Germany feel like this when they go to Berlin. It doesn’t help that Berlin is in the former East Germany, but it is but it isn’t but it is. It’s slightly complicated, but it goes like this. Berlin was completely contained within East Germany, but West Berlin was part of West Germany.</p>
<h2 id=is-berlin-a-city-or-a-country>Is Berlin a city or a country?</h2>
<p>Germany<br>
Berlin, capital and chief urban centre of Germany. The city lies at the heart of the North German Plain, athwart an east-west commercial and geographic axis that helped make it the capital of the kingdom of Prussia and then, from 1871, of a unified Germany.</p>
<h2 id=is-berlin-poor>Is Berlin poor?</h2>
<p>About 435,000 people live in poverty in Berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city’s population of about 3.5 million. Particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in Berlin (23.6 percent) is poor.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-capital-of-east-and-west-berlin>What was the capital of East and West Berlin?</h2>
<p>Berlin. The city itself echoed the national partition— East Berlin being the capital of East Germany and West Berlin a Land (state) of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, or West Germany). West Berlin’s isolation was later reinforced by the concrete barrier erected in 1961 and known as the Berlin Wall.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-city-of-berlin-in-germany>Where is the city of Berlin in Germany?</h2>
<p>Berlin is in Germany. It lies at the heart of the North German Plain in the wide glacial valley of the Spree River, which runs through the center of the city.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-capital-of-germany-after-world-war-2>What was the capital of Germany after World War 2?</h2>
<p>Overview of Berlin. Germany’s division after the war put Berlin entirely within the territory of the German Democratic Republic (GDR, or East Germany). The city itself echoed the national partition— East Berlin being the capital of East Germany and West Berlin a Land (state) of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, or West Germany).</p>
<h2 id=why-was-bonn-chosen-as-the-capital-of-west-germany>Why was Bonn chosen as the capital of West Germany?</h2>
<p>With the division into East Germany and West Germany, the city of Berlin (completely surrounded by East Germany) was divided into East Berlin and West Berlin, divided by the Berlin Wall. Since West Berlin could not serve as a practical capital city for West Germany, Bonn was chosen as an alternative.</p>
