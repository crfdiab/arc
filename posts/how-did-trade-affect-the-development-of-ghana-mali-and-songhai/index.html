<h2 id=how-did-trade-affect-the-development-of-ghana-mali-and-songhai>How did trade affect the development of Ghana Mali and Songhai?</h2>
<p>The gold-salt trade in Africa made Ghana a powerful empire because they controlled the trade routes and taxed traders. Control of gold-salt trade routes helped Ghana, Mali, and Songhai to become large and powerful West African kingdoms. Trade routes were most responsible for aiding the early spread of Islam.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-effects-of-exchanges-between-people-of-ghana-and-mali>What were the effects of exchanges between people of Ghana and Mali?</h2>
<p>One effect of the exchanges was that West Africa became connected to the Islamic trade networks and thus to all of Afro-Eurasia. Mali was one of three medieval kingdoms that ruled over West Africa. The first empire was Ghana, which was ruled by a king from the Soninke people.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-timbuktu-and-why-is-it-important>Where is Timbuktu and why is it important?</h2>
<p>Timbuktu, French Tombouctou, city in the western African country of Mali, historically important as a trading post on the trans-Saharan caravan route and as a centre of Islamic culture (c. 1400–1600). It is located on the southern edge of the Sahara, about 8 miles (13 km) north of the Niger River.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-significance-of-ghana-mali-and-songhai>What was the significance of Ghana Mali and Songhai?</h2>
<p>Ghana, Mali, and Songhai were successful and well-organized states that overcame tribal divisions and fused traditional beliefs with the universal ambitions of Islam. The internal strength of these West African empires was what made the gold trade so successful.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-some-of-the-similarities-and-differences-within-the-ghana-mali-and-songhai-empires>What were some of the similarities and differences within the Ghana Mali and Songhai empires?</h2>
<p>They had different titles for their leaders. The title of the ruler of Mali Empire was Mansa, the title of the ruler of Songhai Empire was Askia, while Ghana had no specific title for its ruler. Mali and Songhai were bigger and better organized than Ghana.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-natural-resources-linked-to-conflict-in-africa>How are natural resources linked to conflict in Africa?</h2>
<p>Abiodun Alao undertakes this broad survey by categorizing natural resources into four groups: land (including agricultural practices and animal stock), solid minerals, oil, and water. Themes linking these resources to governance and conflict are then identified and examined with numerous examples drawn from specific African countries.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-ghana-mali-and-songhai-become-successful>Why did Ghana, Mali, and Songhai become successful?</h2>
<p>These books were often valued more highly than gold at the time. Ghana, Mali, and Songhai were successful and well-organized states that overcame tribal divisions and fused traditional beliefs with the universal ambitions of Islam. The internal strength of these West African empires was what made the gold trade so successful.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-natural-resources-does-mali-have>What kind of Natural Resources does Mali have?</h2>
<p>Mali is considered to have some of the largest gold deposits on the continent. Commercial exploration and mining of gold began in 1984. The nation is currently the third largest exporter of gold on the continent after the top leading countries of Ghana and South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-trade-between-ghana-and-mali>What was the trade between Ghana and Mali?</h2>
<p>When these empires declined, so too did the trade in gold. The historical sources for the empires of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai are written Arabic sources. These sources have a bias against non-Islamic beliefs. Many African griots or storytellers would pass down archaeology stories by word of mouth.</p>
