<h2 id=what-does-the-19th-amendment-say-about-voting>What does the 19th Amendment say about voting?</h2>
<p>Women’s Right to Vote The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-19th-amendment-change-voting-rights>How did the 19th Amendment change voting rights?</h2>
<p>In 1919, the 19th Amendment, which stated that “the rights of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex,” passed both houses of Congress and was sent to the states for ratification.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-19th-amendment-add-to-voters>What did the 19th Amendment add to voters?</h2>
<p>The Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX) to the United States Constitution prohibits the United States and the states from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex, in effect recognising the right of women to a vote.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-twenty-fourth-amendment-do-to-increase-voting-rights-in-the-united-states>What did the twenty fourth Amendment do to increase voting rights in the United States?</h2>
<p>On this date in 1962, the House passed the 24th Amendment, outlawing the poll tax as a voting requirement in federal elections, by a vote of 295 to 86. At the time, five states maintained poll taxes which disproportionately affected African-American voters: Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-nineteenth-amendment-to-the-constitution-say>What did the Nineteenth Amendment to the constitution say?</h2>
<p>The Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution officially extended the right to vote to women. The amendment declares in part that ‘the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.’</p>
<h2 id=which-amendment-to-the-us-constitution-extended-suffrage-to-women>Which amendment to the U.S. Constitution extended suffrage to women?</h2>
<p>Nineteenth Amendment, amendment (1920) to the Constitution of the United States that officially extended the right to vote to women. Opposition to woman suffrage in the United States predated the Constitutional Convention (1787), which drafted and adopted the Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-when-the-19th-amendment-was-ratified>What happened when the 19th Amendment was ratified?</h2>
<p>Passed by Congress June 4, 1919, and ratified on August 18, 1920, the 19th amendment guarantees all American women the right to vote. Achieving this milestone required a lengthy and difficult struggle; victory took decades of agitation and protest.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-southern-states-that-voted-against-the-19th-amendment>Who are the southern states that voted against the 19th Amendment?</h2>
<p>Southern states were adamantly opposed to the amendment, however, and seven of them—Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, South Carolina and Virginia—had already rejected it before Tennessee’s vote on August 18, 1920.</p>
