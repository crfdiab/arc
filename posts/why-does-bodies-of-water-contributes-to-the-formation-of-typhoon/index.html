<h2 id=why-does-bodies-of-water-contributes-to-the-formation-of-typhoon>Why does bodies of water contributes to the formation of typhoon?</h2>
<p>Oceans and seas have great influence on the weather of continental masses. These water evaporated from the sea/ocean is carried up into the atmosphere and condenses, forming clouds from which all forms of precipitation result. Sometimes, intense cyclonic circulations occur which is what we call the tropical cyclones.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-the-bodies-of-water-affect-tropical-cyclones>How do the bodies of water affect tropical cyclones?</h2>
<p>Once they move over cold water or over land and lose touch with the hot water that powers them, these storms weaken and break apart. Recent studies have shown a link between ocean surface temperatures and tropical storm intensity – warmer waters fuel more energetic storms.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-bodies-of-water-and-landmasses-affect-typhoons>How does bodies of water and landmasses affect typhoons?</h2>
<p>Answer: In a very general sense, typhoons gain power as they move over warm bodies of water, and start losing energy once they move on to land. There are other factors in play (temperature of water and air, moisture, air currents, the temperature of the landmass etc.), but that is the general rule.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-typhoons-affected-by-landmasses>How are typhoons affected by landmasses?</h2>
<p>Land masses weaken typhoons, causing them to dissipate if the land mass is large. If a typhoon moves over land, this supply of warm ocean water is cut off, and the typhoon dissipates.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-root-cause-of-typhoon>What is the root cause of typhoon?</h2>
<p>A typhoon forms when winds blow into areas of the ocean where the water is warm. These winds collect moisture and rise, while colder air moves in below. This creates pressure, which causes the winds to move very quickly. The more warm air and moisture there is, the more intense the winds.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-a-typhoon-to-start>What causes a typhoon to start?</h2>
<p>People call these storms by other names, such as typhoons or cyclones, depending on where they occur. Tropical cyclones are like giant engines that use warm, moist air as fuel. That is why they form only over warm ocean waters near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from near the surface.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-landforms-and-bodies-of-water-affect-a-typhoon>How do landforms and bodies of water affect a typhoon?</h2>
<p>How do landforms and bodies of water affect a typhoon? Landforms and bodies of water affect typhoons based on what or how strong the energy is released by the landforms and bodies of water. Typhoons gain energy from warm ocean water and lose energy over cold water.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-typhoon-gain-or-lose-power>How does a typhoon gain or lose power?</h2>
<p>In a very general sense, typhoons gain power as they move over warm bodies of water, and start losing energy once they move on to land. There are other factors in play (temperature of water and air, moisture, air currents, the temperature of the landmass etc.), but that is the general rule. Related Questions.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-some-typhoons-stronger-than-others-in-the-pacific>Why are some typhoons stronger than others in the Pacific?</h2>
<p>“A warmer sea surface generally provides more energy for storm development and thus favors more intense typhoons. A large change in temperature from the surface to subsurface, however, can disrupt this flow of energy, because strong winds drive turbulence in the upper ocean, bringing cold water up from below and thereby cooling the sea surface.”</p>
