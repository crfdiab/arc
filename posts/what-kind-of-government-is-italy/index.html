<h2 id=is-spain-limited-or-unlimited-government>Is Spain limited or unlimited government?</h2>
<p>Despite being a monarchy, Spain is a limited government because it has a constitution, an elected legislature and an elected head of government….</p>
<h2 id=does-the-king-of-spain-have-any-power>Does the King of Spain have any power?</h2>
<p>It is incumbent upon the King: To sanction and promulgate the laws. To summon and dissolve the Cortes Generales and to call for elections under the terms provided for in the Constitution. To call for a referendum in the cases provided for in the Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-types-of-private-limited-companies-in-italy>What are the types of private limited companies in Italy?</h2>

<h2 id=who-are-the-directors-of-a-company-in-italy>Who are the directors of a company in Italy?</h2>
<p>In the Italian traditional system, the management of the Company will be entrusted to a sole director or a Board of Directors (“BoD”) appointed by the shareholders’ meeting. Directors stay in office for 3 financial years; they may, however, be re-elected, unless otherwise provided in the articles of association.</p>
