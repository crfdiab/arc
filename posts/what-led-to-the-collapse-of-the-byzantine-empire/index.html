<h2 id=what-led-to-the-collapse-of-the-byzantine-empire>What led to the collapse of the Byzantine Empire?</h2>
<p>The Byzantine Empire fell in 1453. The immediate cause of its fall was pressure by the Ottoman Turks. The Ottomans had been fighting the Byzantines for over 100 years by this time. In 1454, Constantinople finally fell to them and their conquest of the Byzantine Empire was complete.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-byzantine-empire-rise-and-fall>When did the Byzantine Empire rise and fall?</h2>
<p>The Byzantine Empire existed from approximately 395 CE—when the Roman Empire was split—to 1453. It became one of the leading civilizations in the world before falling to an Ottoman Turkish onslaught in the 15th century.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-byzantine-empire-fall-in-476-ce>Did the Byzantine Empire fall in 476 CE?</h2>
<p>Two of these changes were the new capital at Byzantium and the new Christian character of the empire (Constantine legalized Christianity and eventually converted himself). These changes eventually created a distinct culture which would characterize the Byzantine Empire after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-byzantium-didnt-fall>What would happen if Byzantium didn’t fall?</h2>
<p>If the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire never collapsed, we might not have had the Protestant Reformation. Two things really helped the Reformation to get going. One was The abuses of the Roman Catholic Church in the area of indulgence sales (there were other corruption issues too.)</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-byzantine-empire>What was the rise and fall of the Byzantine Empire?</h2>
<p>The Rise of the Byzantine Empire. The rise of the Byzantine Empire occurred simultaneously with the fall of the Roman Empire. The power and influence of the Roman Empire began in the 3rd century CE, in a period that saw the empire plagued with civil wars caused by the collapse of administrative structures.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-fall-of-constantinople>What was the result of the fall of Constantinople?</h2>
<p>The fall of Constantinople marked the end of a glorious era for the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Constantine XI died in battle that day, and the Byzantine Empire collapsed, ushering in the long reign of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-collapse-of-the-roman-empire>What was the result of the collapse of the Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>Collapse of the Western Roman Empire. In the 5th – 7th century, the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire was a continuation of the Roman Empire. The loss of the Western territories in the 5th century led to the loss of some important cities such as Rome. The creation of the Germanic states of the Franks, Visigoths,…</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-muslims-attack-the-byzantine-empire>When did the Muslims attack the Byzantine Empire?</h2>
<p>In 634, Muslim armies began their assault on the Byzantine Empire by storming into Syria. By the end of the century, Byzantium would lose Syria, the Holy Land, Egypt and North Africa (among other territories) to Islamic forces.</p>
