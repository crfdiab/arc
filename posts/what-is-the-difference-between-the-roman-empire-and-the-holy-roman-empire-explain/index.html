<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-the-roman-empire-and-the-holy-roman-empire-explain>What is the difference between the Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire explain?</h2>
<p>The difference is the Roman Empire that was overseen by the Roman Government. The Holy Roman Empire was overseen by the Holy Roman Emperor (the secular ruler), under the Vatican in Rome. The Roman Empire collapsed in 476 AD, when Rome was sacked by the Goths.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-the-byzantine-empire-and-the-holy-roman-empire>What is the difference between the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>They were both parts of Roman Empire. Byzantine Empire is a term invented in XVIII century by Gibbon. The Byzantine emperors were calling themselves Emperors of Romans. Holy Empire was created by Charles the great and the Pope to recreate the Western part of Empire, but is was completely new.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-connection-between-the-holy-roman-empire-and-the-church>What were the connection between the Holy Roman empire and the Church?</h2>
<p>What were the connections between “The Empire” and “The Church”? The first Holy Roman Emperor was Charlemagne. The Pope appointed him so there was a strong connection between the Church and the empire. The Church was considered above the empire just like heaven is of greater importance than earth.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-most-feared-of-all-the-invaders-of-europe>Who were the most feared of all the invaders of Europe?</h2>
<p>Of the groups who invaded Europe in the 700s and the 800s, which was the most feared? The Vikings. What damage did the invasions cause? They attacked towns, destroyed fields, took prisoners, and towns were looted.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-holy-roman-empire-get-its-power>How did the Holy Roman Empire get its power?</h2>
<p>The Holy Roman Empire was made up of many small principalities that were governed by local rulers who had authority over their land that mostly superseded the power of the emperor. The emperor could not simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the empire; his power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-rome-control-most-of-its-territory>Where did Rome control most of its territory?</h2>
<p>Once it reached its territorial limits in A.D. 117, Rome controlled territory as far west as Spain and Northern Africa, to as far east as the upper regions of the Middle East. A defining characteristic of Rome’s empire is the numerous port cities under its control, which allowed Rome to dominate the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-advantage-of-being-part-of-the-roman-empire>What was the advantage of being part of the Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>Some of these paid for public utilities, like roads and waterworks – being part of the empire did have some advantages. While local inhabitants behaved themselves and paid their taxes, they were allowed to continue with their local customs and religions, as long as these did not directly violate or compromise Roman law.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-hyrcanus-gain-control-of-the-roman-empire>How did Hyrcanus gain control of the Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>He soon took control of virtually all matters of state, thus exercis­ing the authority that technically belonged to Hyrcanus as high priest, and combined with this the powers delegated to him by the Romans, who clearly saw him as their agent.</p>
