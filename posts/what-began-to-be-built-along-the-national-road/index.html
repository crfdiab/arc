<h2 id=what-began-to-be-built-along-the-national-road>What began to be built along the National Road?</h2>
<p>The National Road was the first highway built entirely with federal funds. The road was authorized by Congress in 1806 during the Jefferson Administration. Construction began in Cumberland, Maryland in 1811. The route closely paralleled the military road opened by George Washington and General Braddock in 1754-55.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-roads-built-after-the-war-of-1812>Why were roads built after the War of 1812?</h2>
<p>The National Road was built with the intention of creating closer economic ties between the American west and the original thirteen colonies. At the time it was considered a state-of-the-art roadway. Construction on the National Road itself did not begin until immediately after the War of 1812 (1812–1814).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-reason-that-the-national-road-ended-in-vandalia-illinois-instead-of-extending-further-west>What is the main reason that the National Road ended in Vandalia Illinois instead of extending further west?</h2>
<p>After the Financial Panic of 1837 and the resulting economic depression, congressional funding ran dry and construction was stopped at Vandalia, Illinois, the then capital of Illinois, 63 miles (101 km) northeast of St. Louis across the Mississippi River.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-national-road-built-in-the-united-states>Why was the National Road built in the United States?</h2>
<p>The U.S. Congress took up the issue of building what was called the National Road. The idea was to build a road which would lead from the center of the United States at the time, which was Maryland, westward, to Ohio and beyond.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-road-built-in-maryland>Where was the first road built in Maryland?</h2>
<p>In the far western portion of Maryland, military action during the French and Indian War occasioned the building of Braddock’s Road in 1755, linking Fort Cumberland, near present-day Cumberland, with the Pittsburgh region through what are now Allegany and Garrett counties.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-highway-built-by-the-federal-government>What was the first highway built by the federal government?</h2>
<p>The National Road (also known as the Cumberland Road) was the first major improved highway in the United States built by the federal government.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-national-road-start-and-end>When did the National Road start and end?</h2>
<p>Begun in 1811 to carry settlers and trade from the great capital of Baltimore into the then-wilds of Illinois, The National Road would take four decades to complete. Through city and town, iconic history and welcoming present, trace a route once traveled by wagon and coach.</p>
