<h2 id=which-human-activity-has-probably-contributed-most-to-the-acidification-of-lakes>Which human activity has probably contributed most to the acidification of lakes?</h2>
<p>Which human activity has probably contributed most to the acidification of lakes in the Adirondack region? Toxic chemicals called PCBs, are produced as a result of manufacturing processes, were dumped into the Hudson River.</p>
<h2 id=which-human-activity-would-be-most-likely-to-have-a-negative-impact-on-the-environment-group-of-answer-choices>Which human activity would be most likely to have a negative impact on the environment group of answer choices?</h2>
<p>Which human activity would be most likely to have a negative impact on the environment? Burning non-renewable resources to generate electric power.</p>
<h2 id=which-human-activity-would-have-the-largest-negative-effect-on-biodiversity>Which human activity would have the largest negative effect on biodiversity?</h2>
<p>Deforestation would have the largest negative effect on biodiversity. This is because it destroys habitats and can kill off species.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-characteristic-of-a-stable-environment>Which is a characteristic of a stable environment?</h2>
<p>What is a characteristic of a stable environment? It usually contains a great diversity of species.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-human-activity-would-most-likely-deplete-finite-resources>Which is human activity would most likely deplete finite resources?</h2>
<p>(l) increase the number of drilling sites for crude oil in North America (2) build more power plants away from population centers (3) limit the number of people in each vehicle develop alternative fuel sources that can be produced from renewable resources 19. Which human activity would most likely deplete finite resources?</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-resource-a-finite-or-infinite-resource>What makes a resource a finite or infinite resource?</h2>
<p>Resources — Finite and Infinite 1 It is the mind that makes an object into a resource. 2 As mind is infinite, so resources can be infinite. 3 In the limited human context, the greatest known resource is a human relationship that issues harmonious joy. 4 A resource emerges when the mind evaluates a material in the context of an end use. 更多结果…</p>
<h2 id=how-are-resources-organized-in-the-infinitesimal-sense>How are resources organized in the infinitesimal sense?</h2>
<p>In a sense it is the way infinity hides in the infinitesimal. A resource is energy organized as a usable force or skill. It may even be organized as a power or a link or even a strategy. Human life is negative and therefore positive examples are rare. Whether the example is positive or negative, the principle is true.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-an-inherent-limit-to-the-productivity-of-resources>Is there an inherent limit to the productivity of resources?</h2>
<p>Thus, there is no inherent limit to the potential productivity of resources other than that which is imposed by the limits of our vision and imagination. It is the mind that makes an object into a resource. As mind is infinite, so resources can be infinite.</p>
