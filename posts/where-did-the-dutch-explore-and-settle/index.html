<h2 id=where-did-the-dutch-explore-and-settle>Where did the Dutch explore and settle?</h2>
<p>An English adventurer hired by the Dutch government who led an expedition to find a path to Asia through North America. His expedition led to the establishment of New Amsterdam. New Netherlands was a Dutch colony founded in 1609 by the Dutch East India Company to maintain Dutch fur-trading practices.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-dutch-first-settle>Where did the Dutch first settle?</h2>
<p>New Netherland<br>
New Netherland was the first Dutch colony in North America. It extended from Albany, New York, in the north to Delaware in the south and encompassed parts of what are now the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, and Delaware.</p>
<h2 id=what-areas-did-the-dutch-settle>What areas did the Dutch settle?</h2>
<p>The Dutch colonized many parts of the world — from America to Asia and Africa to South America; they also occupied many African countries for years. From the 17th century onwards, the Dutch started to colonize many parts of Africa, including Ivory Coast, Ghana, South Africa, Angola, Namibia and Senegal.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-most-dutch-immigrants-settle>Where did most Dutch immigrants settle?</h2>
<p>During the early nineteenth century, large numbers of Dutch farmers, forced by high taxes and low wages, started immigrating to America. They mainly settled down in the Midwest, especially Michigan, Illinois and Iowa.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-dutch-settle-in-the-new-world>Where did the Dutch settle in the New World?</h2>
<p>In 1624, a shipload of Flemish Walloons sailed to the New World, then spread themselves throughout the claim. Settlements were started along the Delaware, Connecticut, and Hudson rivers, as well as at the mouth of the Hudson. From the beginning, the outlying ventures were under constant threat of Indian attack and most were abandoned.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-focus-of-the-dutch-exploration>What was the focus of the Dutch exploration?</h2>
<p>From the beginning, the outlying ventures were under constant threat of Indian attack and most were abandoned. The focus of Dutch activity centered on the New Netherland and, to a lesser extent, Fort Orange.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-dutch-colonize-the-hudson-river>When did the Dutch colonize the Hudson River?</h2>
<p>Although the Netherlands only controlled the Hudson River Valley from 1609 until 1664, in that short time, Dutch entrepreneurs established New Netherland, a series of trading posts, towns, and forts up and down the Hudson River that laid the groundwork for towns that still exist today.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-dutch-do-in-the-1600s>What did the Dutch do in the 1600s?</h2>
<p>Dutch Exploration and Colonization. The 1600s were a golden era for the Dutch, much as the 1500s had been for the Spanish. The Dutch merchant fleet became the greatest in the world, Amsterdam glittered as a trade center and a Dutch empire was established. This was the age of Rembrandt and Vermeer.</p>
