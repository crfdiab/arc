<p>Florida alone is home to about 500,000 acres of salt marsh. While about 70% of Florida’s salt marshes occur along the state’s northern coastline, South Florida boasts large expanses of freshwater marsh including the more than 1.5 million acres of the Everglades.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-tidal-freshwater-marshes-different-from-salt-water-marshes>How are tidal freshwater marshes different from salt water marshes?</h2>
<p>Tidal freshwater marshes differ from salt and brackish water marshes in that they are inundated with freshwater only. They typically are located in the upper reaches of estuaries of large rivers.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-freshwater-marshes-restored-to-their-natural-state>How are freshwater marshes restored to their natural state?</h2>
<p>There are many different techniques to restoring a wetland. One common way freshwater marshes are restored is restoration of channelized rivers. When rivers are channelized and straightened, the marshes alongside the rivers disappear. Reverting rivers back to their natural state will allow nearby marshes to form again.</p>
