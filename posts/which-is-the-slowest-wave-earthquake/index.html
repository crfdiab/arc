<h2 id=which-is-the-slowest-wave-earthquake>Which is the slowest wave earthquake?</h2>
<p>Surface waves<br>
Surface waves are the slowest of all seismic waves, traveling at 2.5 km (1.5 miles) per second. In an earthquake, body waves produce sharp jolts, while rolling motions of surface waves do most of the damage in an earthquake.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-slowest-wave>What are the slowest wave?</h2>
<p>surface waves<br>
The slowest (and latest to arrive on seismograms) are surface waves, such as the L wave. L waves are named for the Cambridge mathematician A.E.H. Love who first described them. The surface waves are generally the largest recorded from an earthquake.</p>
<h2 id=which-earthquake-waves-cause-the-most-damage>Which earthquake waves cause the most damage?</h2>
<p>Surface waves cause the most damage during an earthquake. Surface waves only travel along the surface of the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-3-types-of-earthquake-waves-is-the-most-destructive>Which of the 3 types of earthquake waves is the most destructive?</h2>
<p>S waves are more dangerous than P waves because they have greater amplitude and produce vertical and horizontal motion of the ground surface. The slowest waves, surface waves, arrive last. They travel only along the surface of the Earth. There are two types of surface waves: Love and Rayleigh waves.</p>
<h2 id=what-magnitude-earthquake-would-destroy-a-city>What magnitude earthquake would destroy a city?</h2>
<table><tr><th>Magnitude</th><th>Earthquake Effects</th><th>Estimated Number Each Year</th></tr><tr><td>6.1 to 6.9</td><td>May cause a lot of damage in very populated areas.</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>7.0 to 7.9</td><td>Major earthquake. Serious damage.</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>8.0 or greater</td><td>Great earthquake. Can totally destroy communities near the epicenter.</td><td>One every 5 to 10 years</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-destructive-wave-during-an-earthquake>Which is the most destructive wave during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>surface waves During an earthquake, surface waves are the seismic waves that cause the most damage. Unlike other seismic waves that move deep inside the Earth, surface waves move along just under the surface of the Earth like waves in water. Surface waves are the slowest seismic waves and are the final waves to hit an area after an earthquake.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-slowest-wave-on-the-earth>Which is the slowest wave on the Earth?</h2>
<p>The slowest waves, surface waves, arrive last. They travel only along the surface of the Earth. There are two types of surface waves: Love and Rayleigh waves. Love waves move back and forth horizontally. Rayleigh waves cause both vertical and horizontal ground motion.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-seismic-waves>What are the different types of seismic waves?</h2>
<p>The four types of seismic waves present during an earthquake are primary waves, secondary waves, Rayleigh waves and Love waves. Rayleigh and Love waves are the two types of surface waves.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-more-destructive-love-wave-or-primary-wave>Which is more destructive love wave or Primary Wave?</h2>
<p>Love waves are responsible for sideways movements. The other, less destructive types of waves present during an earthquake are primary and secondary waves. Primary waves travel quickly through liquid and solid matter.</p>
