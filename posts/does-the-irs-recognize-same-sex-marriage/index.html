<h2 id=does-the-irs-recognize-same-sex-marriage>Does the IRS recognize same-sex marriage?</h2>
<p>The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have recognized all legal same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes. US Dept. of Treasury and the IRS ruled that same-sex couples, legally married in jurisdictions that recognize their marriages, will be treated as married for federal tax purposes.</p>
<h2 id=are-two-people-that-are-living-together-able-to-file-joint-income-taxes>Are two people that are living together able to file joint income taxes?</h2>
<p>In addition, joint filers are eligible to take a standard deduction that’s double that of a single taxpayer. However, since the IRS only allows a couple to file a joint tax return if the state they reside in recognizes the relationship as a legal marriage; unmarried couples are never eligible to file joint returns.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-federal-government-recognize-domestic-partners>Does the federal government recognize domestic partners?</h2>
<p>While California generally treats registered domestic partners and married couples equally in terms of rights and responsibilities, the federal government does not always treat registered domestic partners the same as spouses for legal or tax purposes.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-irs-consider-a-spouse>What does the IRS consider a spouse?</h2>
<p>For Federal tax purposes, the terms “spouse,” “husband and wife,” “husband,” and “wife” include an individual married to a person of the same sex if the Page 13 13 individuals are lawfully married under state law, and the term “marriage” includes such a marriage between individuals of the same sex.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-income-brackets-for-2020>What are the income brackets for 2020?</h2>
<p>2020 federal income tax brackets</p>
<table><tr><th>Tax rate</th><th>Taxable income bracket</th></tr><tr><td>12%</td><td>$19,751 to $80,250</td></tr><tr><td>22%</td><td>$80,251 to $171,050</td></tr><tr><td>24%</td><td>$171,051 to $326,600</td></tr><tr><td>32%</td><td>$326,601 to $414,700</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=does-filing-married-but-separate-mean>Does filing married but separate mean?</h2>
<p>Married filing separately is a tax status used by married couples who choose to record their incomes, exemptions, and deductions on separate tax returns. Although some couples might benefit from filing separately, they may not be able to take advantage of certain tax benefits.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-claim-my-live-in-girlfriend-as-a-dependent>Can I claim my live in girlfriend as a dependent?</h2>
<p>You can claim a boyfriend or girlfriend as a dependent on your federal income taxes if that person meets the IRS definition of a “qualifying relative.”</p>
<h2 id=can-a-same-sex-couple-file-a-joint-federal-tax-return>Can a same sex couple file a joint federal tax return?</h2>
<p>Same-sex couples in those states will be able to file a joint federal income tax return but need guidance on how to prepare their state income tax return. Assuming a state does not opt to recognize same-sex marriage by next year, viable options pursued by states include:</p>
<h2 id=can-a-virginia-couple-file-a-joint-tax-return>Can a Virginia couple file a joint tax return?</h2>
<p>The Virginia couple has never been able to file joint returns at the federal or state levels, but because the IRS has adopted a “state of celebration” standard, they may now file a joint federal return so long as they have a marriage certificate issued by another state that recognizes same-sex marriage.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-married-couples-have-to-file-taxes>When do married couples have to file taxes?</h2>
<p>The rule is that if you’re legally married on the last day of the year—Dec. 31—you’re married for the entire year for tax purposes. Married couples must choose between married filing jointly and married filing separately filing statuses in most cases.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-domestic-partner-file-a-married-state-tax-return>Can a domestic partner file a married state tax return?</h2>
<p>Domestic partners and civil union couples must therefore choose between the single or head of household filing statuses. Domestic partners and civil union couples might be required to file married tax returns at their state level, however.</p>
