<p>Number and “vote value” of provincial council members depends on the number of inhabitants. Eerste Kamer members are elected by the provincial council. Direct vote. Participants need to be Dutch nationals over 18 years of age who are eligible to vote. Once every four years. Over 400 municipalities in the Netherlands.</p>
