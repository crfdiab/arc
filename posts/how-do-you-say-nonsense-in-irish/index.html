<h2 id=how-do-you-say-nonsense-in-irish>How do you say nonsense in Irish?</h2>
<p>An Irish word meaning nonsense or foolish talk – one I use now and then – is ráiméis.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-word-for-no-in-gaelic>Is there a word for no in Gaelic?</h2>
<p>There’s no “yes” or “no” in Irish. There are no words for “yes” or “no” in Irish, but that doesn’t mean there’s no way to answer a question. You communicate “yes” and “no” with a verb form.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-codswallop-mean>What is codswallop mean?</h2>
<dl>
<dt>nonsense</dt>
<dd>words or ideas that are foolish or untrue : nonsense The notion that Scott was waylaid by bad luck is “a lot of codswallop,” said Roland Huntford, a British historian.—</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id=is-duolingo-gaelic-irish-or-scottish>Is duolingo Gaelic Irish or Scottish?</h2>
<p>The course is called Irish, not Gaelic. Scottish Gaelic is closely related to Irish, but the two languages have diverged over time, and many individual words and phrases have taken on different meanings. Duolingo doesn’t have a Scottish Gaelic course.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-certain-things-that-irish-people-hate>Are there certain things that Irish people hate?</h2>
<p>WE’RE A JOLLY people, but we do love a moan. Frequently about the same things over and over again. For, there are certain things we just can’t abide. Things like these: Inexcusable. However, we love giving out about it. Awful shite. Again, we love giving out about it. Unacceptable. Now a bargain, that’s something to boast about. Most of the time…</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-irish-curse-words>What are some of the Irish curse words?</h2>
<p>A word that tends to throw people off and really get ya where it hurts. A tool is a dope mixed with a gowl mixed with a gobshite. A tool will say a sentence and say ‘NAAT’ at the end, just to be a tool. A tool will spit in your hand before shaking it at Mass.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-irish-sayings-about-ireland>Why are there so many Irish sayings about Ireland?</h2>
<p>But for tourists, it’s often a troubling time to visit Ireland mainly for one reason. A non-Irish will find it hard to understand the words. Oftentimes, non-Irish are baffled and confused with the language. Let’s just say that people of Emerald Isle have a way of saying things that make little to no grammatical sense.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-have-anti-irish-sentiment>What does it mean to have anti Irish sentiment?</h2>
<p>Anti-Irish sentiment, also called Hibernophobia, may refer to or include oppression, persecution, discrimination, or hatred of Irish people as an ethnic group or nation, whether directed against the island of Ireland in general or against Irish emigrants and their descendants in the Irish diaspora .</p>
