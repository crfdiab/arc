<h2 id=what-happened-at-chernobyl-and-why-did-it-happen>What happened at Chernobyl and why did it happen?</h2>
<p>On April 26th, 1986, a nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, Ukraine failed violently during a scheduled test of the turbine system. The power of the reactor increased out of control from a low-power state, rapidly boiling water and causing a steam explosion that blew the roof off the the reactor.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-at-the-chernobyl-reactor-in-russia>What happened at the Chernobyl reactor in Russia?</h2>
<p>Background. On April 26, 1986, a sudden surge of power during a reactor systems test destroyed Unit 4 of the nuclear power station at Chernobyl, Ukraine, in the former Soviet Union. The accident and the fire that followed released massive amounts of radioactive material into the environment.</p>
<h2 id=was-chernobyl-in-russia-when-it-exploded>Was Chernobyl in Russia when it exploded?</h2>
<p>The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on Saturday 26 April 1986, at the No. 4 reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union. The accident started during a safety test on an RBMK-type nuclear reactor.</p>
<h2 id=did-chernobyl-affect-russia>Did Chernobyl affect Russia?</h2>
<p>Ukraine, Belarus and parts of Russia received substantial amounts of radiation exposure after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, but prior to the disaster the number of children affected by thyroid cancer was relatively low globally.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-chernobyl-nuclear-power-plant-accident-happen>Where did the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident happen?</h2>
<p>The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the No. 4 nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-died-in-the-chernobyl-disaster>How many people died in the Chernobyl disaster?</h2>
<p>Some sources state that two people were killed in the initial explosions, whereas others report that the figure was closer to 50. Dozens more contracted serious radiation sickness; some of these people later died.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-trial-for-the-chernobyl-disaster>When was the trial for the Chernobyl disaster?</h2>
<p>Chernobyl trial. The trial of the perpetrators of the Chernobyl disaster took place in July-August 1987 in Chernobyl; a year or so after the incident. It was held in a closed zone, although on Soviet radio and television this court was called open.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-ghost-town-in-chernobyl>What was the name of the ghost town in Chernobyl?</h2>
<p>The city of Pripyat was built to house workers of the nuclear power plant in the 1970s. It has been an abandoned ghost town since the accident, and is now used as a laboratory to study fallout patterns. The impact of the disaster on the surrounding forest and wildlife also remains an area of active research.</p>
