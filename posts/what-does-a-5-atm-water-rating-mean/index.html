<h2 id=what-does-a-5-atm-water-rating-mean>What does a 5 ATM water rating mean?</h2>
<p>5 ATM, Swim. Withstands pressures equivalent to a depth of 50 meters. splashes, rain or snow, showering, swimming, diving into water, snorkeling. 10 ATM. Withstands pressures equivalent to a depth of 100 meters.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-go-swimming-with-a-5-atm-watch>Can I go swimming with a 5 ATM watch?</h2>
<p>5 BAR / 5 ATM / 50m / 165ft: Your watch can withstand splashes, shower and is suitable for swimming. It is not suitable for water sports, pool-side diving or sea diving.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-can-i-swim-with-a-5-atm-watch>How long can I swim with a 5 ATM watch?</h2>
<p>It performed fine diving from a boat for snorkeling to depths of 20 to 30 feet with no problem. A 5 ATM watch has been tested to a depth of 5 atmospheres of pressure. 1 ATM is air pressure at sea level. So 5 ATM is 130 feet or 40 meters in sea water.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-water-resistant-atm-mean>What does water resistant ATM mean?</h2>
<p>The higher the ATM rating, the deeper the device can go, as deeper water exerts more pressure. The ATM pressure/water resistance rating is the one most often found on regular mechanical and battery driven watches. One ATM translates to the static pressure exerted by static submersion in 10 meters of water.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-shower-with-a-50m-water-resistant-watch>Can you shower with a 50m water resistant watch?</h2>
<p>If a watch has a water resistance rating of 30 meters, it can usually handle light water exposure, such as some rain or hand washing. A watch with a 50-meter water resistance rating can go for a short swim and quick shower, but better leave it in your watch box if you’ll be spending long periods of time in the water.</p>
<h2 id=how-deep-is-50m-in-a-pool>How deep is 50m in a pool?</h2>
<p>The Olympic sized pool is 165 feet long by 56 feet wide (8 lap lanes, each 7 feet wide). It holds 490,000 gallons (almost 1/2 million gallons). Depth begins at 3.5 feet and gradually slopes down to 13 feet at the deepest end.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-swim-with-a-30-atm-watch>Can I swim with a 30 atm watch?</h2>
<p>But what do they mean? 3 ATM/bar/30m: This watch are resistant against rain and splashes. 5 ATM/bar/50m: This watch is waterproof and can be worn during swimming without jumping from a diving board. They are not qualitfied to snorkle or dive.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-shower-with-a-50m-watch>Can I shower with a 50m watch?</h2>
<h2 id=how-deep-underwater-is-3-atm>How deep underwater is 3 ATM?</h2>
<p>30 meters<br>
Stated in units of pressure such as atmospheres (ATMs), or depth such as meters, water resistance levels typically range from 3 ATM (30 meters) to 20 ATM (200 meters) and diver’s watches at 200+ meters.</p>
<h2 id=is-50m-water-resistant-good>Is 50m water resistant good?</h2>
<p>50m – Water resistant up to 50 meters means it can withstand swimming and cold showers. 100m – Water resistant up to 100 meters means it is possible to swim or snorkel with the watch on, but it is not appropriate for diving. 200m – Water resistant up to 200 meters, usually means you can dive with your watch on.</p>
<h2 id=how-waterproof-is-a-50m-watch>How waterproof is a 50m watch?</h2>
<p>5 ATM/bar/50m: This watch is waterproof and can be worn during swimming without jumping from a diving board. They are not qualitfied to snorkle or dive. 10 ATM/bar/100m: This watch is waterproof and good for most watersports like swimming, sailing and snorkeling in shallow water.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-50m-water-resistant>How much is 50m water resistant?</h2>
<p>BARS or ATM/Meters So what do these markings actually mean? 50m – Water resistant up to 50 meters means it can withstand swimming and cold showers. Hot showers are different as hot water would allow the watch to expand and potentially allow water to get in.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-water-resistant-5-atm-or-50-meters>Which is water resistant 5 atm or 50 meters?</h2>
<p>The confusion arises because of what the “5 ATM” or “50 meters” indicates. It does not indicate that the device is water-resistant under all conditions to 50 meters below the surface of the water.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a-5atm-water-resistant-watch-mean>What does a 5ATM water resistant watch mean?</h2>
<p>The ATM or “atmospheres” is the amount of pressure a watch can withstand. 5ATM will withstand pressures equivalent to about 50 meters, or 164 ft under water. It is important to note that this is a measure of pressure NOT depth. 5ATM doesn’t mean the watch can be used diving to a depth of 50 meters.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-water-resistance>What do you need to know about water resistance?</h2>
<p>Anybody can claim their device is water-resistant, but you shouldn’t trust their claim without seeing how they define the water-resistance of their product. There are two principal terms and ratings used to convey water-resistance. The first is Atmospheres (ATM) rating and the second is IP (Ingress Protection) rating.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-100-meters-of-water-resistance-mean>What does 100 meters of water resistance mean?</h2>
<p>Water Resistant 100 Meters / 10 Atmospheres / 10 Bar. This is snorkeling territory. A watch with 100 meters of water resistance has no problem hanging out in the water for a while, and will even be fine on an extended snorkeling excursion.</p>
