<p>Michael Jackson hid away in rural town for six months – and I was his secret chauffeur.</p>
<h2 id=did-michael-jackson-perform-in-ireland>Did Michael Jackson perform in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Michael Jackson performed at Páirc Uí Chaoimh on July 31, 1988. Concert promoter Oliver Barry described the concerts on July 30 and July 31 as the most spectacular Ireland has ever seen. It’s hard to argue that Cork has seen anything quite as powerful as the sight and sound of Jackson on stage.</p>

<h2 id=did-michael-jackson-own-a-house-in-ireland>Did Michael Jackson own a house in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Towards the end of his stay in Westmeath, Jackson started to look at prospective houses to buy. When the Dunnings bought a further property, Bishopstown House, a derelict Georgian estate a mile or so away, Jackson visited it and discussed the renovations with Paddy. Both houses have six bedrooms and five bathrooms.</p>

<h2 id=did-michael-jackson-live-in-cork>Did Michael Jackson Live in Cork?</h2>
<p>Michael Jackson spent several weeks on this luxury 25-acre estate on the outskirts of the scenic town of Kinsale in 2007. The County Cork hideaway where Michael Jackson stayed with his three children in 2007 while looking for an Irish property of his own is on the market for a whopping €6.35 million ($7.55 million).</p>

<p>Páirc Uí Chaoimh was also the venue for Prince’s first ever Irish concert on 7 July 1990, as part of his Nude Tour.</p>
<h2 id=is-now-a-good-time-to-sell-a-house-in-ireland>Is now a good time to sell a house in Ireland?</h2>
<p>“Our agents are also reporting that both purchasers and three-bed semi vendors are looking for larger homes, which is having an adverse effect on the supply chain, with the result that time taken to sell is now four weeks on average in Dublin and the major cities, and as low as three in some parts of the capital.”</p>
<h2 id=when-did-michael-jackson-first-go-to-ireland>When did Michael Jackson first go to Ireland?</h2>
<p>Between 1988 and his death in 2009, Jackson visited Ireland many more times, often to play live, but several times to enjoy the seclusion and privacy afforded to him and his family. In celebration of St. Patrick’s Day, here’s 6 things the King of Pop loved about Ireland…</p>

<h2 id=where-are-michael-jacksons-shoes-on-irish-driver>Where are Michael Jackson’s shoes on Irish driver?</h2>
<p>And the shoes the King of Pop played in now have pride of place in the centre. Ms Carroll said: “Straight away we brought them into the office, we put them into the glass case. They’ve been there ever since.” • Michael Jackson’s Irish Driver airs this afternoon at 2pm on RTE Radio One.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-michael-jackson-live-before-he-died>Where did Michael Jackson Live before he died?</h2>
<p>Michael Jackson’s secret retreat in Ireland’s County Westmeath opens its doors to weekend guests. But is it a thriller?
