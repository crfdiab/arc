<p>Its passengers were in search of a new life – some seeking religious freedom, others a fresh start in a different land. They would go on to be known as the Pilgrims and influence the future of the United States of America in ways they could never have imagined.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-pilgrim-fathers-and-what-did-they-do>Who were the Pilgrim Fathers and what did they do?</h2>
<p>Pilgrim Fathers, in American colonial history, settlers of Plymouth, Massachusetts, the first permanent colony in New England (1620). Of the 102 colonists, 35 were members of the English Separatist Church (a radical faction of Puritanism) who had earlier fled to Leiden, the Netherlands, to escape persecution at home.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims or Pilgrim Fathers were the first English settlers of the Plymouth Colony in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Their leadership came from the religious congregations of Brownist Puritans who had fled the volatile political environment in England for the relative calm and tolerance of 17th-century Holland in the Netherlands.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-pilgrims-establish-the-plymouth-colony>When did the pilgrims establish the Plymouth Colony?</h2>
<p>They eventually determined to establish a new settlement in the New World and arranged with investors to fund them. They established Plymouth Colony in 1620, which became the second successful English settlement in America, following the founding of Jamestown, Virginia in 1607.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-pilgrims-settle-in-the-netherlands>Where did the pilgrims settle in the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>Permission from the city counsel of Leiden that the Pilgrims were allowed to settle there, dated February 12th 1609. The Pilgrims moved to the Netherlands around 1607/08. They lived in Leiden, Holland, a city of 30,000 inhabitants, residing in small houses behind the “Kloksteeg” opposite the Pieterskerk.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-term--pilgrims-of-leyden--come-about>When did the term ” Pilgrims of Leyden ” come about?</h2>
<p>A song composed for the occasion used the word Pilgrims, and the participants drank a toast to “The Pilgrims of Leyden”. The term was used prominently during Plymouth’s next Forefather’s Day celebration in 1800, and was used in Forefathers’ Day observances thereafter.</p>
