<p>The giant cat was caught in the Ohio River during a fishing tournament. The blue catfish weighed in at nearly 60 pounds and was under 45 inches long….What’s the biggest catfish ever caught in Ohio?</p>

<p>The United States contains thousands of rivers, many of which serve as important features of the physical geography of the country. Many state borders are defined in relation to rivers, and many individual states took their name after a nearby river of significance. The border between Indiana and Kentucky is formed by the Ohio River.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-border-between-ohio-and-kentucky>What is the border between Ohio and Kentucky?</h2>
<p>The Tug and Big Sandy rivers mark the boundary between Kentucky and West Virginia to the east and northeast. The Ohio River forms the boundary between the states of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio to the north. The Mississippi River demarcates the short southwestern border with the state of Missouri.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-dispute-between-indiana-and-kentucky-end>How did the dispute between Indiana and Kentucky end?</h2>
<p>The dispute was forwarded to the Supreme Court which held that the lowest watermark would form the border, which favored Indiana’s claims. The ruling did not end the dispute as Kentucky claimed the whole river to be its territory and collected millions of dollars in revenue over the river’s use.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-a-boundary-between-indiana-and-ohio>Why was there a boundary between Indiana and Ohio?</h2>
<p>Because of those shifts, and because the Ohio River level has been raised by dam construction, Indiana and Ohio contended that the 1792 boundary is now somewhere near the middle of the river. ”There is not now, nor will there ever be in the future, an Evansville, Ky.,” Indiana’s Attorney General, Linley E. Pearson, said of the settlement.</p>
