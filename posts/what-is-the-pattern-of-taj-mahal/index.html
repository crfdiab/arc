<h2 id=what-is-the-pattern-of-taj-mahal>What is the pattern of Taj Mahal?</h2>
<p>Reflection symmetries characterize the pattern of paving stones surrounding the Taj Mahal. Farther away, the tiling pattern consists of four-pointed stars and elongated hexagons (above). Even the drainage holes in some of the stones have a striking hexagonal pattern.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-taj-mahal-built>How was the Taj Mahal built?</h2>
<p>The Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry along a central axis on which the main features are placed. The building material used is brick-in-lime mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi precious stones.</p>
<h2 id=what-colour-is-taj-mahal>What Colour is Taj Mahal?</h2>
<p>The Taj Mahal becomes just like the time of the sun rising in the morning. But at this time, the yellow color is spreading its unique hue on the Taj Mahal, which looks quite beautiful and cool.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-colour-of-taj-mahal-in-night>What is the Colour of Taj Mahal in night?</h2>
<p>Changing Hues An interesting facet of the Taj Mahal is that it changes colours throughout the day. During sunrise, it appears to be pale pink; in the afternoon, it is sparkling white; and in the evenings, it turns a bronzish-orange as the sun sets. In late evenings, the Taj appears to be light-bluish in colour.</p>

<p>Step 2- Cut out the base of the larger box. Step 3- Tape the base you just cut so that the flaps don’t keep opening up as you can see from the picture below.Next make a large newspaper ball to make the top part of the monument.Also cut out smaller cardboard pieces to make the side walls and fold them a bit.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-make-a-taj-mahal-out-of-foam>How do you make a Taj Mahal out of foam?</h2>
<p>Cut two foam pieces and make two parts. Make both top and bottom part little bit round by cutting the corners. Using small and smooth grained sand papers, sand all around the edges to give it a round onion shape. Now glue both the pieces and give a smooth sanding on the joining.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-taj-mahal-located-in-india>Where is the Taj Mahal located in India?</h2>
<p>Make one or buy one and gift as a unique. The ‘Taj Mahal’ is the most beautiful and brightest symmetrical structure made by the Ivory white marbles. It’s located on the south bank of the Yamuna river in Agra,India.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-make-an-onion-dome-for-the-taj-mahal>How to make an onion dome for the Taj Mahal?</h2>
<p>Make both top and bottom part little bit round by cutting the corners. Using small and smooth grained sand papers, sand all around the edges to give it a round onion shape. Now glue both the pieces and give a smooth sanding on the joining. Make the bottom part of the onion dome base flat, as same diameter of the drum.</p>
