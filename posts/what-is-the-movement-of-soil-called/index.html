<h2 id=what-is-the-movement-of-soil-called>What is the movement of soil called?</h2>
<p>infiltration<br>
Movement of water into soil is called infiltration, and the downward movement of water within the soil is called percolation, permeability or hydraulic conductivity. Spaces in soil, between the mineral and organic matter, that are filled with water or air.</p>
<h2 id=what-has-happened-to-the-soil-after-the-heavy-rainfall>What has happened to the soil after the heavy rainfall?</h2>
<p>After a heavy rainfall, soil starts to spread out; soil structure is lost. Erosion depletes nutrient supplies or macronutrients like nitrogen, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. This changes the soil content, soil texture at the surface, water-holding capacity, and pH levels.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-soil-when-it-rains>What happens to soil when it rains?</h2>
<p>When it rains, water falling to the surface of the soil will either infiltrate into the soil or run off along the surface. Part of the water that infiltrates into the soil will be absorbed by the upper soil layers and part will seep down into the deeper soil layers.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-types-of-erosion>What are 3 types of erosion?</h2>
<p>Erosion involved three processes: detachment (from the ground), transportation (via water or wind), and deposition. The deposition is often in places we don’t want the soil such as streams, lakes, reservoirs, or deltas.</p>
<h2 id=which-setup-did-the-soil-move-faster>Which setup did the soil move faster?</h2>
<p>Answer: 1. ➪The soil move faster/fastest to solid. Because molecules in solids are often packed close together unlike liquid and gas.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-movement-of-materials-through-soil-layers>What is the movement of materials through soil layers?</h2>
<p>The movement of material in true solution of colloidal suspension from one place to another within the soil. Soil horizons that have lost material through eluviation are eluvial; those that have received material are illuvial.</p>
<h2 id=does-rain-wash-away-soil-nutrients>Does rain wash away soil nutrients?</h2>
<p>ANSWER: Yes, the heavy rain washed some of the nutrients out of the potting soil. You might also wonder if the next time you water, are you washing nutrients out of the potting soil. The answer is yes, as did the rain. These fertilizers release mineral nutrients over a long period of time.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-rain-impact-erosion>How does rain impact erosion?</h2>
<p>The splashed particles clog soil pores, effectively sealing off the soil surface and leading to poor water infiltration. Instead of soaking into the soil, rainwater collects and moves down-slope in sheet or rill erosion, forming gullies and carrying soil particles.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-erodibility-of-soil>What is Erodibility of soil?</h2>
<p>Erodibility describes or is a measure of the inherent resistance of geologic materials (soils and rocks) to erosion. Highly erodible geologic materials are readily displaced and transported by water.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-nitrogen-in-soil-after-heavy-rains>What happens to nitrogen in soil after heavy rains?</h2>
<p>Furthermore, water movement into soil, leaching, runoff and ponding are not uniform across the landscape with heavy rains; thus, the potential for N loss can be variable.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-rainfall-patterns-related-to-soil-erosion>How are rainfall patterns related to soil erosion?</h2>
<p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine response of runoff and soil erosion to storm patterns. Results showed that in lower rainfall intensities a linear function fits the relationship between soil loss and rainfall intensity whereas this function tends to be non-linear at higher intensities.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-aggregates-in-dry-soil>What happens to the aggregates in dry soil?</h2>
<p>Slaking is the breakdown of aggregates on wetting, into smaller particles. Slaking generally occurs when intense rainfall hits dry soil, the aggregates collapse as a result of the pressure created by the clay swelling and the trapped air expanding and escaping.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-runoff-affect-the-erosion-of-soil>How does runoff affect the erosion of soil?</h2>
<p>Soil loss from runoff plots on various soil types have shown different erosion rates under the same conditions of rainfall, topography and vegetal cover ( Hussein, Kariem, & Othman, 2007 ).</p>
