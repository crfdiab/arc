<h2 id=what-is-the-main-difference-between-equator-and-prime-meridian>What is the main difference between Equator and Prime Meridian?</h2>
<p>The main difference between Equator and Prime Meridian is that Equator is the line circling the Earth halfway between the North and South poles while Prime Meridian is the line that runs through Greenwich, England.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-local-and-standard-time-and-equator-and-prime-meridian>What is the difference between local and standard time and Equator and Prime Meridian?</h2>
<p>Answer Expert Verified standard time remains fixed for the particular country. the place on the same longitude has the different standard time. Equator separates the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Prime Meridian runs through Greenwich and is at 0° longitude.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-prime-meridian-hot-like-the-equator>Is the Prime Meridian hot like the Equator?</h2>
<p>The prime meridian is the opposite of the equator. It cuts the globe in half vertically and separates the world into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The farthest point from the prime meridian is 180 degrees in either direction, which is actually the same line. 180 degrees east is the same as 180 degrees west.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-prime-meridian-and-standard-meridian>What is the difference between prime meridian and standard meridian?</h2>
<p>Just as the prime meridian is the standard for longitude, UTC is the standard for time. The Earth’s longitude measures 360, so the halfway point from the prime meridian is the 180 longitude line. The meridian at 180 longitude is commonly known as the International Date Line.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-prime-meridian>What is meant by Prime Meridian?</h2>
<p>The prime meridian is the line of 0° longitude, the starting point for measuring distance both east and west around the Earth. The prime meridian is arbitrary, meaning it could be chosen to be anywhere.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-prime-meridian-and-the-equator-real>Is the prime meridian and the equator real?</h2>
<p>A Key Piece of Trivia to Stump Your Friends. Geography. The equator and prime meridian are both invisible lines that circle the Earth, and they help us in navigation. Though invisible, the equator (0 degrees latitude) is a very real location that divides the world into the Northern and Southern hemispheres.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-the-equator-and-the-meridian>What’s the difference between the equator and the meridian?</h2>
<p>Key Difference: The equator is the imaginary circle that draws a line between the Northern hemisphere and Southern hemisphere. It is the point from where the latitude is calculated. In other words, the equator is at 0° latitude.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-prime-meridian-in-the-eastern-or-western-hemisphere>Is the Prime Meridian in the eastern or Western Hemisphere?</h2>
<p>The Equator is at 0° latitude. The Prime Meridianseparates the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The Prime Meridian runs through Greenwich, England and is at 0° longitude. Where you are on the earth has an affect on the day length. Day length at the Equator At latitude 0° (the Equator) day length will be approximately 12 hours.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-prime-meridian-real-or-an-imaginary-line>Is the prime meridian real or an imaginary line?</h2>
<p>The equator is an important line on the earth’s surface. It marks the line above which the sun is directly overhead on the March and September equinoxes. The prime meridian, on the other hand, is an imaginary line, created by people to mark zero degrees longitude. It just happens to pass through Greenwich, but it could have been located anywhere.</p>
