<h2 id=why-did-the-earliest-settlements-develop-along-rivers>Why did the earliest settlements develop along rivers?</h2>
<p>The first civilizations formed on the banks of rivers. Rivers were attractive locations for the first civilizations because they provided a steady supply of drinking water and made the land fertile for growing crops.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-settlements-built-near-rivers>Why are settlements built near rivers?</h2>
<p>Water supply – settlements need water, they often locate on wet point sites for this. Settlements built away from rivers and water supplies to avoid flooding are located at dry point sites.</p>
<h2 id=what-civilization-is-older-mayan-or-egyptian>What civilization is older Mayan or Egyptian?</h2>
<p>Egypt civilization appears to have begun about 4,000 to 3,500 B.C. in northern Africa, while the Mayan civilization appears to have arisen around 3300 B.C. in the Yucatan peninsula of North America, now modern Guatemala.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-settle-by-water>Why did people settle by water?</h2>
<p>People learned that they could stay in one place and grow enough food to feed their community, if they were near a water supply. As time went on, waterways began to serve more purposes. Rivers, lakes, and seas began to be used for transportation. People built boats, and started exploring the area around them.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-sites-for-early-settlements-chosen>How were sites for early settlements chosen?</h2>
<p>Early sites for settlements were chosen because of natural advantages such as good water supply, dry land, defence, shelter, farmland and building materials. Cut out the dominoes below and study the key words written on them. Working in pairs, place all the dominoes in a straight line, matching the correct terms.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-first-settle-near-the-river-valleys>Why did people first settle near the river valleys?</h2>
<p>River Valleys are most fertile region and the first human settlement were all done to do agriculture. The fertile soil in these regions were best suited for agriculture. Hence people first settled near river valleys.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-people-settle-in-the-world>Where did the first people settle in the world?</h2>
<p>River valleys are most fertile region and the first human settlement were all done to do agriculture. The fertile soil in these regions were best suited for agriculture. Hence people first settled near river valleys.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-early-civilizations-settle-near-coasts-or-waterways>Why did early civilizations settle near coasts or waterways?</h2>
<p>However, before the invention of steam power and automation the fastest means of travel was by boat. Having access to the coast meant faster travel and shipping of goods and people. You will find a lot of the ancient urban capitals of the world are close to a waterway. Thames River, London. Etc</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-want-to-live-near-rivers>Why did people want to live near rivers?</h2>
<p>Meaning water is life. Most of civilizations sparked near rivers because : Rivers provide water for drinking. River provide water for irrigation and soil around rivers is also very fertile. So easy growing plants. Fishes from rivers were important food source. Water transport for trading with other people. Sewage management is easy near rivers.</p>
