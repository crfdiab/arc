<p>What three strategies were adopted by the suffragists to win the vote? 1) Tried to get state legislatures to grant women the right to vote. 2) They pursued court cases to test the Fourteenth Amendment. 3) They pushed for a national constitutional amendment to grant them the right to vote.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-womens-suffrage-leaders-achieve-success-quizlet>How did women’s suffrage leaders achieve success quizlet?</h2>
<p>Women used moral persuasion, state-by-state, and federal amendments. They convinced state legislatures to grant women the right to vote. Then, women pushed for a national constitutional amendment. Moral persuasion was the most successful because it worked to get female suffrage in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and Idaho.</p>

<p>During the woman suffrage movement in the United States, “suffragists” were anyone—male or female—who supported extending the right to vote (suffrage) to women. In fact, many states allowed women to vote well before the Federal government did so in 1920.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-conference-held-that-kicked-off-the-suffrage-movement-in-1848-quizlet>Where was the conference held that kicked off the suffrage movement in 1848 quizlet?</h2>
<p>The meeting took place in Seneca Falls, New York on July 19th and 20th 1848. 300 Women and 40 men went to the second day to discuss the rights of women. They wrote the Declaration of Sentiments, which among other things, tried to get women the right to vote.</p>

<p>Seneca Falls Convention<br>
On July 19, 1848, the Seneca Falls Convention convened. Heralded as the first American women’s rights convention, the two day event was held in the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls, New York. The convention had been advertised on July 11, 1848 in the Seneca County Courier.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-the-suffragists-have>What impact did the suffragists have?</h2>
<p>The suffragists believed in achieving change through parliamentary means and used lobbying techniques to persuade Members of Parliament sympathetic to their cause to raise the issue of women’s suffrage in debate on the floor of the House.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-suffragists-win-vote>How did suffragists win vote?</h2>
<p>The Suffragettes waged a very literal battle to overcome bigotry and win the vote for women. Yes, they resorted to violent tactics, from smashing windows and arson attacks to setting off bombs and even attacking works of art. We’re not debating the rights and wrongs of their methods.</p>
