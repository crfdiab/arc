<h2 id=which-major-problems-pakistan-is-facing-now-a-day>Which major problems Pakistan is facing now a day?</h2>
<p>Pakistan’s big — arguably, biggest — problem is water scarcity. The country faces acute water scarcity by 2025, and will be the most water-stressed country in South Asia within two decades. Almost 30 million Pakistanis have no access to clean water.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-1-challenge-that-the-people-of-pakistan-face>What is 1 challenge that the people of Pakistan face?</h2>
<p>Externally, Pakistan faced challenges mainly on two counts; the conflict in Afghanistan and the unresolved Kashmir dispute. In the past two decades we have been victims of terrorism that today poses a major threat worldwide.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-challenge-faced-by-youth-of-pakistan-today>What is the biggest challenge faced by youth of Pakistan today?</h2>
<p>Unemployment<br>
Unemployment is one of the biggest problems facing the youth of today. The situation has worsened in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Lack of proper education and skills is among the factors affecting the chances of our younger workforce of getting employed.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-problems-that-pakistan-is-facing>What are the problems that Pakistan is facing?</h2>

<h2 id=what-are-the-problems-of-pakistan-after-partition>What are the problems of Pakistan after partition?</h2>
<p>1 1947, 14 August: partition of British India, sovereign states of Pakistan and India established. 2 1947, 27 October: undeclared war with India 3 1948, 21 March: the birth of a regional movement 4 1948, April: canal water dispute 5 1948, 11 September: the death of Jinnah, Nazimuddin becomes Governor-General</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-a-power-shortage-in-pakistan>Why is there a power shortage in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Pakistan faces a significant challenge in revamping its network responsible for the supply of electricity. Contrary to Pakistani government and expatriate claims, Pakistan suffers from a massive electricity shortage. Electricity generation in Pakistan has shrunk by 50% in recent years due to an overreliance on hydroelectric power.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-political-process-in-pakistan-not-let-to-prosper>Why is the political process in Pakistan not let to prosper?</h2>
<p>This is probably also the main reason why the political process in Pakistan is not let to prosper. Soon after its inception the sincere and loyal politicians were removed from the main stream and only dummy agents and rubber stamps are put in place, while all the decisions are made outside the country. 5.</p>
