<p>Ecology is the study of interactions between organisms and their surround- ings including other organisms. Organisms grow, multiply, occupy different regions, compete with others for resources, prey upon others, transform into different species etc.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-study-of-how-living-things-interact-in-an-ecosystem>What is the study of how living things interact in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Ecology is the study of how living things interact with each other and their environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-interactions-in-an-ecosystem>What are the interactions in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Summary. Species interactions within ecological webs include four main types of two-way interactions: mutualism, commensalism, competition, and predation (which includes herbivory and parasitism).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-ecologist>What is the role of ecologist?</h2>
<p>Ecologists study the relationship between plants, animals and the environment. They look at how animals and plants inhabit a particular environment, and report on the likely impact of any proposed construction works.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-study-of-living-things-in-their-environment>Which is the study of living things in their environment?</h2>
<p>The study of living things in their environment is called ecology. Ecology looks at how living things interact with everything around them, both living and non-living.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-living-things-organized-in-an-ecosystem>How are living things organized in an ecosystem?</h2>

Living things are categorized, from simplest to most complex, into the following levels of organization: organism, species, population, community, ecosystem, biome, and biosphere.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-explore-interactions-between-organisms-in-an-ecosystem>How to explore interactions between organisms in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>In this activity, you will explore the interactions that one organism has with the other organisms around it, and with the environment in which it lives. Materials: notebook or graphic organizer 1. Create a graphic organizer to represent interactions between a spider and its environment. 2.</p>
