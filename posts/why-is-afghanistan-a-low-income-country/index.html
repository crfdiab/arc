<h2 id=why-is-afghanistan-a-low-income-country>Why is Afghanistan a low income country?</h2>
<p>The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) was launched to serve as the country’s poverty reduction strategy. It identifies factors that contribute to poverty such as lack of infrastructure, limited access to markets, social inequity, historical and ongoing conflict, and various productivity constraints.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-unemployment-rate-for-afghanistan>What is the unemployment rate for Afghanistan?</h2>
<p>Unemployment refers to the share of the labor force that is without work but available for and seeking employment. Afghanistan unemployment rate for 2020 was 11.73%, a 0.75% increase from 2019. Afghanistan unemployment rate for 2019 was 10.98%, a 0.08% decline from 2018.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-current-unemployment-rate-so-low>Why is the current unemployment rate so low?</h2>
<p>The low entry rate reflects a long-run downward trend likely due to population aging, better job matches, and other structural factors. We find that current unemployment is so low not because of the high job-finding rate but because of low entry rates into unemployment, from both employment and OLF.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-income-in-afghanistan>What is the average income in Afghanistan?</h2>
<p>Average Salary / Afghanistan. Average salary in Afghanistan is 1,428,379 AFN per year. The most typical earning is 77,188 AFN.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-stop-poverty-in-afghanistan>How can we stop poverty in Afghanistan?</h2>
<p>To reduce poverty, Afghanistan must focus on strengthening agriculture, investing in human development and managing and mitigating risks that increase poor people’s vulnerability.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-current-unemployment-rate-2020>What is the current unemployment rate 2020?</h2>
<p>The seasonally-adjusted national unemployment rate is measured on a monthly basis in the United States. In July 2021, the national unemployment rate was at 5.4 percent….Monthly unemployment rate in the United States from July 2020 to July 2021 (seasonally-adjusted)</p>
<table><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Unemployment rate</th></tr><tr><td>Jul ’20</td><td>10.2%</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-lowest-unemployment-rate-in-us-history>What is the lowest unemployment rate in US history?</h2>
<p>The unemployment rate has varied from as low as 1% during World War I to as high as 25% during the Great Depression. More recently, it reached notable peaks of 10.8% in November 1982 and 14.7% in April 2020.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-good-salary-in-afghanistan>What is a good salary in Afghanistan?</h2>
<p>A person working in Afghanistan typically earns around 77,900 AFN per month. Salaries range from 19,700 AFN (lowest average) to 348,000 AFN (highest average, actual maximum salary is higher). This is the average monthly salary including housing, transport, and other benefits.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-current-unemployment-rate-in-afghanistan>What is the current unemployment rate in Afghanistan?</h2>
<p>Unemployment Rate in Afghanistan increased to 11.20 percent in 2020 from 11.10 percent in 2019. source: World Bank 10Y 25Y 50Y</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-gdp-of-afghanistan-in-2016>What was the GDP of Afghanistan in 2016?</h2>
<p>In 2016, Afghanistan’s GDP growth was 1.2 percent. While this was an increase, it is not enough to bring workers out of unemployment. Economists estimate that GDP growth needs to be eight percent to successfully employ the Afghan work force. Unfortunately, continuing conflict and insecurity within the country makes this growth unlikely.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-economy-of-afghanistan-so-poor>Why is the economy of Afghanistan so poor?</h2>
<p>Rural Afghanistan is poor due to its dependence on agriculture and informal labor markets. Low investments and natural disasters have hurt the agriculture market that most Afghans depend on for employment.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-effects-of-unemployment>What are some of the effects of unemployment?</h2>
<p>The worst adverse effect of unemployment is that a person who is unemployed has a very hard time getting hired. Companies usually hire people who already have jobs as people with jobs usually socialize in similar places and word of mouth and referrals increase their chances of getting new jobs.</p>
