<h2 id=what-benefits-did-world-war-i-bring-to-americans>What benefits did World War I bring to Americans?</h2>
<p>In addition, the conflict heralded the rise of conscription, mass propaganda, the national security state and the FBI. It accelerated income tax and urbanisation and helped make America the pre-eminent economic and military power in the world.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-world-war-1-affect-american-life>How did World War 1 affect American life?</h2>
<p>The World War 1 experience impacted hugely on U.S. culture, domestic politics and society. The war also resulted in an increased demand for weapons abroad. This led to increased profits and heightened productivity in the American steel industry. World War 1 ushered in an era of using chemical weapons.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-world-war-1-affect-citizens>How did World War 1 affect citizens?</h2>
<p>Because of the war, many people suffered from disease and malnutrition because of food shortages brought about by a disruption in trade. Millions of men were also mobilized for the war, taking their labor away from farms, which cut down food production.</p>
<h2 id=what-problems-did-the-us-faced-during-ww1>What problems did the US faced during WW1?</h2>
<p>The United States faced many problems following World War I, including in the areas of race relations, labor, and political radicalism.</p>
<h2 id=did-ww1-have-a-positive-or-negative-effect-on-american-society>Did ww1 have a positive or negative effect on American society?</h2>
<p>When the First World War was raging in Europe, the United States suffered from the effects of war. These effects were, however, positive for American society, even though there were riots of violence. Also, African Americans were gaining jobs that men had left behind to go fight in the war.</p>
<h2 id=what-conditions-were-present-in-the-united-states-after-world-war-1>What conditions were present in the United States after World war 1?</h2>
<p>What conditions were present in the United States after World War I? There were many problems with inflation and unemployment. Strikes caused a fear of communist and a revolution in the US.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-help-in-world-war-1>How did the US help in World War 1?</h2>
<p>The American Expeditionary Forces arrived in Europe in 1917 and helped turn the tide in favor of Britain and France, leading to an Allied victory over Germany and Austria in November 1918. By the time of the armistice, more than four million Americans had served in the armed forces and 116,708 had lost their lives.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-world-war-1-on-african-americans>What was the impact of World War 1 on African Americans?</h2>
<p>World War I was a transformative moment in African-American history. What began as a seemingly distant European conflict soon became an event with revolutionary implications for the social, economic, and political future of black people.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-world-war-1-affect-the-lives-of-people>How did World War 1 affect the lives of people?</h2>
<p>Henceforth, it was to be known as the “Zone Rouge,” a place fit for military training and nothing else. People have returned to some of the towns as the ground became safer, but a large strip of land is still considered impossible for human life.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-american-economy-like-during-world-war-1>What was the American economy like during World War 1?</h2>
<p>Wartime opportunities in the urban North gave hope to such individuals. The American industrial economy grew significantly during the war. However, the conflict also cut off European immigration and reduced the pool of available cheap labor.</p>
