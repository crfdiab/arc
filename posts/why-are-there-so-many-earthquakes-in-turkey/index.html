<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-earthquakes-in-turkey>Why are there so many earthquakes in Turkey?</h2>
<p>Earthquakes on the North Anatolian fault are caused by the northwards motion of the Arabian plate against the Eurasian plate, squeezing the small Turkish micro plate westwards.</p>
<h2 id=is-turkey-vulnerable-to-earthquakes>Is Turkey vulnerable to earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Turkey, one of the most earthquake-vulnerable parts of the seismically circum-Mediterranean region.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-istanbul-more-prone-to-earthquakes>Why is Istanbul more prone to earthquakes?</h2>
<p>The country is among the world’s most seismically active zones as it is situated on several active fault lines, with the most potentially devastating being the Northern Anatolia Fault (NAF), the meeting point of the Anatolian and Eurasian tectonic plates.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-die-in-the-earthquake-in-turkey>How many people die in the earthquake in Turkey?</h2>
<p>The death toll from Friday’s earthquake in the Aegean Sea has reached 100, with the deaths of 98 people in Turkey’s western city of Izmir, disaster authorities said. Two teenagers also died on the Greek island of Samos, authorities said. It was the deadliest quake to hit Turkey in nearly a decade.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-earthquake-in-turkey>What was the cause of the earthquake in Turkey?</h2>
<p>The quake appears similar to those that occur on mapped faults east of the Anatolian block that have oblique-thrust faulting, a combination of side-to-side and up-and-down slipping. Regardless of the exact mechanism, the quake is just the latest to hit the country.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-earthquake-fault-lines-in-turkey>Where are the earthquake fault lines in Turkey?</h2>
<p>Turkey is a seismically active area within the complex zone of collision between the Eurasian Plate and both the African and Arabian Plates.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-turkey-such-a-hot-spot-for-earthquakes>Why is Turkey such a hot spot for earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Turkey earthquake does not surprise seismologists. Turkey is, in effect, caught in a geophysical vise between the Arabian plate, inching northward, and the Eurasian plate, the immovable object.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-earthquake-in-turkey-on-oct-23>Where was the earthquake in Turkey on Oct 23?</h2>
<p>The Oct. 23 quake struck in the afternoon, about 9 miles (16 kilometers) north-northeast of the city of Van. The quake ruptured 12.4 miles (20 km) underground. In Eastern Turkey, the Arabian Plate — a huge slab of the Earth’s crust — is slowly smashing into the Eurasian Plate at a speed of less than 1 inch per year (24 millimeters per year).</p>
