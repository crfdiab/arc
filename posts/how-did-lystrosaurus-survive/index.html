<h2 id=how-did-lystrosaurus-survive>How did Lystrosaurus survive?</h2>
<p>It’s also possible that Lystrosaurus’ adaptation to underground life prepared it for a world whose atmosphere was full of dust and ash for centuries. Those big lungs may have been the perfect way to breathe as the Siberian volcano erupted. Another way Lystrosaurus survived was simply by walking.</p>
<h2 id=what-continent-did-the-lystrosaurus-live-in>What continent did the Lystrosaurus live in?</h2>
<p>It is thought to have been herbivorous and grew to approximately one metre in length, with a stocky build like a pig. Fossils of Lystrosaurus are only found in Antarctica, India and South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-adaptations-did-the-lystrosaurus-need-to-survive>What adaptations did the Lystrosaurus need to survive?</h2>
<p>It has therefore been suggested that Lystrosaurus survived and became dominant because its burrowing life-style made it able to cope with an atmosphere of “stale air”, and that specific features of its anatomy were part of this adaptation: a barrel chest that accommodated large lungs, short internal nostrils that …</p>
<h2 id=how-might-the-locations-of-lystrosaurus-fossils-be-seen-as-evidence-the-continents-were-once-together>How might the locations of Lystrosaurus fossils be seen as evidence the continents were once together?</h2>
<p>How might the locations of Lystrosaurus fossils be seen as evidence that the continents were once together? The Lystrosauros ae spread apart all of the ocean and so the continents would have had to been together in order for them to be spread all over.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-lystrosaurus-go-extinct>When did Lystrosaurus go extinct?</h2>
<p>Lystrosaurus, extinct genus of about seven species of medium-sized heavily built animals that lived from the middle of the Permian Period (298.9 million to 251.9 million years ago) until early in the Triassic Period (251.9 million to 201.3 million years ago).</p>
<h2 id=can-the-lystrosaurus-swim>Can the Lystrosaurus swim?</h2>
<p>Its fossils are found only in South Africa and South America. Lystrosaurus fossils are only found in Antarctica, India, and South Africa. Similar to the land dwelling Cynognathus, the Lystrosaurus would have not had the swimming capability to traverse any ocean.</p>
<h2 id=which-animal-was-found-on-two-continents-even-after-it-went-extinct>Which animal was found on two continents even after it went extinct?</h2>
<p>Eight species of pangolins are found on two continents. They range from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered.</p>
<h2 id=is-lystrosaurus-a-synapsid>Is Lystrosaurus a Synapsid?</h2>
<p>Lystrosaurus was part of the Dicynodontia (an extinct group of mammal-like reptiles), part of the larger synapsid clade of vertebrates which includes living mammals. Its fossils have been discovered in Africa, India, and Antarctica.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-lystrosaurus-favorite-food>What is a Lystrosaurus favorite food?</h2>
<p>The Lystrosaurus is quite possibly the easiest passive tame available in ARK: Survival Evolved. Its order of food preference is Rare Flower, Vegetables, and then berries. The Rare Flower will cut taming down to just a handful of minutes for even the highest level spawns of the creature.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-lystrosaurus-fossils-found-in-the-world>Where are the Lystrosaurus fossils found in the world?</h2>
<p>About Lystrosaurus. The most impressive thing about Lystrosaurus is how widespread it was. The remains of this Triassic reptile have been unearthed in India, South Africa and even Antarctica (these three continents were once merged together into the giant continent of Pangea), and its fossils are so numerous that they account for a whopping 95…</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-lystrosaurus-therapsid-lizard-live>Where did the Lystrosaurus therapsid lizard live?</h2>
<p>Lystrosaurus (meaning “shovel lizard” in Greek) is an extinct genus of dicynodont therapsid that lived during the Late Permian and Early Triassic periods, around 250 million years ago in what is now Antarctica, India and South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-lystrosaurus-related-to-the-curvatus>How is the Lystrosaurus related to the curvatus?</h2>
<p>It was probably closely related to the African Lystrosaurus curvatus, which is regarded as one of the least specialized species and has been found in very Late Permian and very Early Triassic sediments. Distribution of four Permian and Triassic fossil groups used as biogeographic evidence for continental drift, and land bridging.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-lystrosaurus-during-the-triassic-period>How big was the Lystrosaurus during the Triassic period?</h2>
<p>LystrosaurusTherapsids, such as Lystrosaurus, were mammal-like reptiles that thrived early in the Triassic Period (252 million to 201 million years ago). Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Lystrosaurus was roughly 1 metre (about 3 feet) long and was heavily built.</p>
