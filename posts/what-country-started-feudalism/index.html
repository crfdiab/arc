<h2 id=what-country-started-feudalism>What country started feudalism?</h2>
<p>20 Jul 2021. Feudalism is the name given to the system of government William I introduced to England after he defeated Harold at the Battle of Hastings. Feudalism became a way of life in Medieval England and remained so for many centuries. William I is better known as William the Conqueror.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-feudal-system-end>When did feudal system end?</h2>
<p>End of European feudalism (1500–1850s) Most of the military aspects of feudalism effectively ended by about 1500.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-rise-of-feudalism-start>Why did the rise of feudalism start?</h2>
<p>the central government of Europe collapsed. As the Vikings invaded western European kingdoms, local nobles took over the duty of raising armies and protecting their property. Power passed from kings to local lords, giving rise to a system known as feudalism.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-feudalism-start-to-take-place-in-europe>When did feudalism start to take place in Europe?</h2>
<p>Although feudalismdevelops as early as the 8th century, under the Carolingian dynasty, it does not prevail widely in Europe until the 10th century – by which time virtually the entire continent is Christian. For the next 500 years, great accumulations of power and landed wealth pass between a few favoured players as if in a vast board game.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-use-the-word-feudal>Who was the first person to use the word feudal?</h2>
<p>The phrase “feudal system” appeared in 1736, in Baronia Anglica, published nine years after the death of its author Thomas Madox, in 1727. In 1771, in his History of Manchester, John Whitaker first introduced the word “feudalism” and the notion of the feudal pyramid.</p>

<p>This article is about the classic, or medieval, Western European form of feudalism. For feudalism as practiced in other societies, as well as that of the Europeans, see Examples of feudalism. Investiture of a knight (miniature from the statutes of the Order of the Knot, founded in 1352 by Louis I of Naples ).</p>
<h2 id=is-the-feudatory-system-in-india-a-feudal-system>Is the feudatory system in India a feudal system?</h2>
<p>There is debate among historians whether the feudatory system in India qualifies as true feudalism, as apparently there was a lack of an economic contract between king, vassal and serf. Other historians however argue that the similarities are significant enough to describe it as feudalism.</p>
