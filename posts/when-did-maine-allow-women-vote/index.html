<h2 id=when-did-maine-allow-women-vote>When did Maine allow women vote?</h2>
<p>In the end, on November 5, Maine ratified the Nineteenth Amendment. The final tally in the state House was 72 for and 68 against, making Maine the nineteenth state to ratify. At a state suffrage meeting in Augusta on November 12, MWSA dissolved and reformed as the League of Women Voters (LWV) of Maine.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-women-get-the-official-right-to-vote>When did women get the official right to vote?</h2>
<p>Millions of white women already possessed voting rights when the 19th Amendment was ratified, and millions more gained that right on August 18, 1920.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-maine-ratify-the-19th-amendment>When did Maine ratify the 19th Amendment?</h2>
<p>Maine ratified the 19th Amendment on November 5, 1919.</p>
<h2 id=which-political-party-supported-womens-right-to-vote>Which political party supported women’s right to vote?</h2>
<p>It was a decisive victory, and the split among Democrats and Republicans was staggering. In all, over 200 Republicans voted in favor of the 19th Amendment, while only 102 Democrats voted alongside them.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-legal-status-of-a-married-woman-in-the-colonies>What was the legal status of a married woman in the colonies?</h2>
<p>Under the common law legal doctrine known as coverture, a married woman in British North American colonies and later in the United States had hardly any legal existence apart from her husband. Her rights and obligations were subsumed under his.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-massachusetts-pass-the-married-womens-property-act>When did Massachusetts pass the married women’s Property Act?</h2>
<p>New Jersey passed a limited statute in 1852 and in 1874 another version that one historian described as “comprehensive and progressive”. Massachusetts passed its Married Women’s Property Act on May 5, 1855. It allowed married women to own and sell real and personal property, control their earnings, to sue and to make wills.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-maine-before-the-revolution>What was the population of Maine before the Revolution?</h2>
<p>Maine had been administered as a district of Massachusetts since 1647. Before the Revolution, Maine had a population of only 10,000 people clustered around the southern coastal ports and closely identified with the shipping and trade interests of Massachusetts. Maine’s demographics changed dramatically in the early 1800s.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-maine-under-represented-in-the-massachusetts-legislature>Why was Maine under represented in the Massachusetts legislature?</h2>
<p>A further irritant was the fact that Maine towns were under-represented in the Massachusetts legislature. Another source of dissatisfaction was a law that reduced the price of Maine lumber, enriching Massachusetts at the expense of Maine. And Massachusetts tax laws appeared unfair to Maine farmers.</p>
