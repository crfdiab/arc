<h2 id=how-many-rhinos-are-killed-each-year-by-poachers>How many rhinos are killed each year by poachers?</h2>
<p>Fewer than 400 rhinos were poached in South Africa last year, according to the latest figures reported by South Africa’s Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries (DEFF) on 1 February 2021….394 rhinos poached in South Africa during 2020.</p>
<table><tr><th>Provinces and National Parks</th><td>Total</td></tr><tr><th>2017</th><td>1,028</td></tr><tr><th>2018</th><td>769</td></tr><tr><th>2019</th><td>594</td></tr><tr><th>2020</th><td>394</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=were-any-rhinos-killed-in-kenya-2020>Were any rhinos killed in Kenya 2020?</h2>
<p>Rhino poaching down from 59 cases in 2013 to zero in 2020, says Kenya Wildlife Service. Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) has said that no rhino was poached in the East African nation in the year 2020, a rare occurrence to be witnessed in the country since 1999.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-african-rhinos-are-killed-each-year>How many African rhinos are killed each year?</h2>
<p>Yet, a rhino is still killed every day: there is a lot more to do. South Africa holds the majority of the world’s rhinos and has been the country hit hardest by poaching criminals, with more than 1,000 rhinos killed each year between 2013 and 2017.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-rhinos-are-lost-on-the-african-continent-due-to-poaching-each-day>How many rhinos are lost on the African continent due to poaching each day?</h2>
<p>3<br>
From 1990 to 2007, South Africa lost an average of 13 rhinos to poaching each year; today, around 3 are lost there every day.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-rarest-rhino-still-alive-today>What is the rarest rhino still alive today?</h2>
<p>northern white rhinoceros<br>
There are now just two northern white rhinoceros remaining in the world. Najin and Fatu (both female) live under constant protection from poachers in Kenya’s Ol Pejeta Conservancy. Sudan (the last remaining male) died on March 19th 2018, effectively rendering the entire subspecies extinct.</p>
<h2 id=do-rhino-horns-grow-back-after-being-cut-off>Do rhino horns grow back after being cut off?</h2>
<p>A rhino’s horn is made of keratin, the same substance that makes up human hair and nails. Just like nails, a rhino’s horn grows back after being cut. It continuously grows throughout the rhino’s life and can be safely filed down without injuring the rhino.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-rhinos-have-been-lost-to-poaching-in-africa>How many rhinos have been lost to poaching in Africa?</h2>
<p>In the last decade, 9,885 African rhinos have been lost to poaching. *The 2020 African-wide poaching figure is estimate based on current official statistics (these have not been released for all countries). The current rhino poaching crisis began in 2008, with increasing numbers of rhino killed for their horn throughout Africa until 2015.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-worst-year-for-poaching-in-kenya>When was the worst year for poaching in Kenya?</h2>
<p>First Kenya was hit hard: its worst year for poaching was in 2013 when 59 animals were killed (more than 5% of the national population).</p>
<h2 id=how-many-white-rhinos-are-there-in-kenya>How many white rhinos are there in Kenya?</h2>
<p>Together they number between 25,000 and 30,000 on the continent today. Kenya is home to one of the largest populations of rhinos in Africa, after South Africa. It also has only two remaining female northern white rhinos, whose species is on the brink of extinction after the last male died in March.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-rhinos-are-killed-each-day-in-the-world>How many rhinos are killed each day in the world?</h2>
<p>Thankfully, the numbers show a decrease of 259 compared to the previous year (1,028 rhino were poached in 2017). But this positive sign does not mean rhinos are now thriving. It shows at least two rhinos were killed each day in 2018.</p>
