<p>temple school<br>
People who could afford it sent their boys to be educated at the temple school called the House of Life. Those who could not afford it taught their boys at home. Girls, although they were equal under the law, did not go to school, even if their parents could afford it.</p>
<h2 id=did-children-have-to-work-in-ancient-egypt>Did children have to work in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>No child was left to raise themselves. Since everyone had a job in ancient Egypt, until about age 5 a child’s job was to learn how to talk and walk and play. Both boys and girls were encouraged to play games that developed strength and agility.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-school-did-ancient-egypt-have>What kind of school did ancient Egypt have?</h2>
<p>Schools that taught ancient Egyptian education were generally attached to religious temples or government buildings. This implies that education was constantly monitored and molded by the authorities. People who acted as teachers were generally priests of the temples or government officials acting as scribes.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-a-private-tutor-for-my-child>Where can I find a private tutor for my child?</h2>
<p>Our In-person search will remain active for those looking to schedule face to face lessons at a later date. First Tutors helps you to find private tutors as your child progresses from primary school to secondary exams and right through to university.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-tutees-work-to-find-private-tutors>How does tutees work to find private tutors?</h2>
<p>The site works as an ‘open marketplace’, where tutees choose private tutors based on merit and relevance to their tuition needs.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-students-get-free-tutoring-each-year>How many students get free tutoring each year?</h2>
<p>Twenty-two percent of students received free tutoring services, according to their parents. Receipt of information about free tutoring from the student’s school varied by race/ethnicity and family structure among students who attended such schools. Receipt of free tutoring also varied by race/ ethnicity.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-good-tutors-for-home-tuition>Are there any good tutors for home tuition?</h2>
<p>The tutors I have used and am currently using have always been excellent and assisted my children in areas where they needed help. They have all been approachable and reliable and their help very much appreciated. It is a great website. We found a tutor who is perfect.</p>
