<h2 id=what-led-to-the-secession-of-the-southern-states>What led to the secession of the Southern states?</h2>
<p>Many maintain that the primary cause of the war was the Southern states’ desire to preserve the institution of slavery. Others minimize slavery and point to other factors, such as taxation or the principle of States’ Rights. Two major themes emerge in these documents: slavery and states’ rights.</p>
<h2 id=was-the-secession-of-the-confederacy-legal>Was the secession of the Confederacy legal?</h2>
<p>Some have argued for secession as a constitutional right and others as from a natural right of revolution. In Texas v. White (1869), the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession unconstitutional, while commenting that revolution or consent of the states could lead to a successful secession.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-act-of-the-confederacy>What was the first act of the Confederacy?</h2>
<p>Confederate Conscription Acts<br>
The Confederate Conscription Acts, 1862 to 1864, were a series of measures taken by the Confederate government to procure the manpower needed to fight the American Civil War. The First Conscription Act, passed April 26, 1862, made any white male between 18 to 35 years old liable to three years of military service.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-confederate-states-of-america-secede>Why did Confederate states of America secede?</h2>
<p>Convinced that white supremacy and the institution of slavery were threatened by the November 1860 election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency, on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories, the Confederacy declared its secession from the United States.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-confederate-states-of-america-secede>When did the Confederate States of America secede?</h2>
<p>Loading… The Confederate States of America — commonly referred to as the Confederacy — was an unrecognized republic in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865. Many historians have said their secession from the United States was an illegal act of war, but others say the right was clearly stated in the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-secession-movement-lead-to-the-civil-war>How did the secession movement lead to the Civil War?</h2>
<p>Secession was declared by pro-Confederate governments in Missouri and Kentucky (see Confederate government of Missouri and Confederate government of Kentucky), but did not become effective as it was opposed by their pro-Union state governments. This secession movement brought about the American Civil War.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-declaration-of-causes-of-secession>What was the declaration of causes of secession?</h2>
<p>This is particularly true in the four states that provided “Declaration of Causes” for their secession. The ordinances of secession were the actual legal language by which the seceded states severed their connection with the Federal Union.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-secession-of-the-state-of-alabama>What was the secession of the state of Alabama?</h2>
<p>Be it declared and ordained by the people of the State of Alabama, in Convention assembled, That the State of Alabama now withdraws, and is hereby withdrawn from the Union known as “the United States of America,” and henceforth ceases to be one of said United States, and is, and of right ought to be a Sovereign and Independent State. Sec 2.</p>
