<h2 id=which-problem-was-significant-for-the-texas-army-in-early-1836>Which problem was significant for the Texas Army in early 1836?</h2>
<p>Answer: A significant problem for the Texas Army in the early 1836 was a lingering loyalty toward Mexico by some of its men. Explanation: The independence of Texas from Mexico took place on March 2, 1836.</p>
<h2 id=what-changed-texas-in-1836>What changed Texas in 1836?</h2>
<p>In March 1836, a second political convention declared independence and appointed leadership for the new Republic of Texas. Mexican General José de Urrea led a contingent of troops on the Goliad Campaign up the Texas coast, defeating all Texian troops in his path and executing most of those who surrendered.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-in-texas-in-the-spring-of-1836>What happened in Texas in the spring of 1836?</h2>
<p>On April 21, 1836, Sam Houston and some 800 Texans defeated Santa Anna’s Mexican force of approximately 1,500 men at the Battle of San Jacinto, shouting “Remember the Alamo!” and “Remember Goliad!” as they attacked. However, the treaty was later abrogated and tensions built up along the Texas-Mexico border.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-army-of-the-people-during-the-texas-revolution>What was the army of the people during the Texas Revolution?</h2>
<p>The Texian Army, also known as the Revolutionary Army and Army of the People, was the land warfare branch of the Texian armed forces during the Texas Revolution. It spontaneously formed from the Texian Militia in October 1835 following the Battle of Gonzales.</p>

<p>Approximately 3,700 men joined the army between October 2, 1835, during the Battle of Gonzales through the end of the war on April 21, 1836, at the Battle of San Jacinto. After gaining independence the Texian Army would be officially known as the Army of the Republic of Texas.</p>

<p>After the Texas victory in Bexar in early December, men began leaving the army and returning home. By the end of February 1836, fewer than 600 men remained in the army. A total of 917 men served in the army for varying lengths of time in January – March 1836.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-texas-revolution-of-1835>Who was involved in the Texas Revolution of 1835?</h2>
<p>The Texas Revolution (October 2, 1835 – April 21, 1836) was a rebellion of colonists from the United States and Tejanos (Texas Mexicans) in putting up armed resistance to the centralist government of Mexico.
