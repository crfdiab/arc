<h2 id=what-did-the-iranian-students-demand-of-the-united-states>What did the Iranian Students demand of the United States?</h2>
<p>Motivations. The Muslim Student Followers of the Imam’s Line demanded that Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi return to Iran for trial and execution. The U.S. maintained that the Shah – who was to die less than a year later, in July 1980 – had come to America for medical attention.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-with-the-shah-of-iran>What happened with the Shah of Iran?</h2>
<p>He left Iran for exile on 17 January 1979. Soon thereafter, the Iranian monarchy was formally abolished, and Iran was declared an Islamic republic led by Ruhollah Khomeini. The Shah died in exile in Egypt, whose president, Anwar Sadat, had granted him asylum.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hostages-were-killed-in-the-iranian-embassy>How many hostages were killed in the Iranian embassy?</h2>
<p>During the 17-minute raid they rescued all but one of the remaining hostages and killed five of the six hostage-takers….Hostages.</p>
<table><tr><th>Hostage</th><th>Occupation</th><th>Fate</th></tr><tr><td>Abbas Lavasani</td><td>Chief Press Officer</td><td>killed prior to assault</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-accurate-is-movie-argo>How accurate is movie Argo?</h2>
<p>Argo’s central, nutty storyline—in which the CIA establishes a fake movie production, complete with a full script and ads in Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, in order to rescue six Americans stranded in post-revolutionary Iran—is 100 percent true, and pretty incredible.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-shah-allowed-into-the-us>Why was the Shah allowed into the US?</h2>
<p>People were encouraging him to allow the Shah in for health care and he asked them all: “If the Iranians react negatively, if they should seize our State Department officials there and make them hostages, then what is your policy?” The room went dead, if not ashen.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-shah-of-iran-flee-to-the-us>When did the Shah of Iran flee to the US?</h2>
<p>With that, his regime collapsed and the shah fled. The shah traveled to several countries before entering the United States in October 1979 for medical treatment of his cancer. In Tehran, Islamic militants responded on November 4 by storming the U.S. embassy and taking the staff hostage.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-carter-administration-hesitant-to-admit-the-shah-to-the-us>Why was the Carter administration hesitant to admit the Shah to the US?</h2>
<p>The Carter Administration hesitated, recognizing potential consequences for U.S. interests in Iran if Pahlavi were welcomed into the country.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-responsible-for-the-overthrow-of-the-shah-of-iran>Who was responsible for the overthrow of the Shah of Iran?</h2>
<p>Although these programs were applauded by many in Iran, Islamic leaders were critical of what they saw as the westernization of Iran. Ruhollah Khomeini, a Shiite cleric, was particularly vocal in his criticism and called for the overthrow of the shah and the establishment of an Islamic state.</p>
