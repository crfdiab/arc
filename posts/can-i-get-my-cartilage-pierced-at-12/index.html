<p>There is not a definite age limit for a legal piercing. Any person can perform body piercing who has consent. You don’t get pierced below the neck if you are under 18 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-get-a-cartilage-piercing-uk>How old do you have to be to get a cartilage piercing UK?</h2>
<p>Despite many piercing salons imposing their own age restrictions for body piercings, there is no legal age restriction for any kind of piercing in England and Wales, unlike in Scotland, where people under 16 are required to have a parent’s permission before having ears and other body parts pierced.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-12-year-old-get-their-cartilage-pierced-at-claires>Can a 12 year old get their cartilage pierced at Claire’s?</h2>
<p>Minors (under the age of 18 in the US and under the age of 16 in Canada) will need a parent or legal guardian present to sign the Claire’s Ear Piercing Registry and show a government issued ID before getting started.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-age-to-get-a-cartilage-piercing>What is the best age to get a cartilage piercing?</h2>
<p>Consent and Other Considerations Goode suggests waiting until at least age 10 for a second earlobe piercing; 13 for a cartilage piercing; age 14 for nostrils, lips and navels; age 15 for a tragus; and 17 or 18 for an industrial piercing.</p>
<h2 id=are-piercing-guns-illegal-in-uk>Are piercing guns illegal in UK?</h2>
<p>Petition Ban the use of Piercing Guns in the UK Plastic guns CANNOT be sterilised and pose a great risk for bloodborne pathogen transmission/infection. Piercing guns cause significant tissue damage due to blunt force trauma and can shatter cartilage. The length/design of gun studs is inappropriate.</p>
<h2 id=do-claires-pierce-noses-with-a-gun>Do Claire’s Pierce noses with a gun?</h2>
<p>never never never NEVER EVER get anything pierced at a claires or hair salon or anywhere that is not a professional tatoo or piercing parlor and that will use a piercing gun. They are not hygienic place and they use un hygienic equipment.</p>

<p>Therefore, while there is no specific legal control over the age at which body piercing can be offered in the UK, we have our own strict professional practice guidelines and we have set our own piercing age restrictions, which you can see below.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-piercings-can-you-get-at-12>What kind of piercings can you get at 12?</h2>
<p>What piercings can you get at 12? is the commonly asked question now a days, Piercing is originated from countries such as Egypt, Africa, Israel and many other. Piercings also carry a great deal of cultural meaning in many civilizations.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-have-a-nose-piercing-in-the-uk>Is it legal to have a nose piercing in the UK?</h2>
<p>Piercings are generally safe, so there is very little restriction placed on them by national law, although it can differ depending on the local area you’re in or the specific establishment you’re using.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-need-to-be-to-get-your-helix-pierced>How old do you need to be to get your helix pierced?</h2>
<p>As the previous person stated, it does depend on the business whether they have age restrictions or not.
