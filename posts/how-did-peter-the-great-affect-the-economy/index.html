<h2 id=how-did-peter-the-great-affect-the-economy>How did Peter the Great affect the economy?</h2>
<p>Peter brought many reforms in order to open the window to Europe. Economic reforms played an important role in the transformation of the whole country. As a result, Russia was able to achieve a good standing among the European countries in areas such as manufacturing, trade, and military.</p>
<h2 id=did-peter-the-great-tax-peasants>Did Peter the Great tax peasants?</h2>
<p>Previously, peasants had skirted the tax by combining several households into one estate; now, however, each peasant was assessed individually for a tax of 70 kopeks, paid in cash.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-peter-the-great-have>What impact did Peter the Great have?</h2>
<p>Peter the Great modernized Russia—which, at the start of his rule, had greatly lagged behind the Western countries—and transformed it into a major power. Through his numerous reforms, Russia made incredible progress in the development of its economy and trade, education, science and culture, and foreign policy.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-peter-the-great-tax-in-1705>What did Peter the Great tax in 1705?</h2>
<p>tax on beards<br>
In 1705, Russian Czar Peter the Great instituted a tax on beards as part of his plan to modernize and westernize his backward country. Peasants and clerics were exempt, but everyone else who wanted to wear a beard had to pay an annual fee and carry a medal as proof of payment.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-peter-the-great-do-to-his-son>What did Peter the Great do to his son?</h2>
<p>But even those royals might have been aghast at the actions of Russian czar Peter the Great, who in 1718 had his eldest son tortured to death for allegedly conspiring against him. Peter even instituted a tax on beards as part of his efforts to make Russians look and act more like Western Europeans.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-peter-the-great-die>How did Peter the Great die?</h2>
<p>Gangrene<br>
Peter the Great/Cause of death</p>
<p>Peter died between four and five in the morning 8 February 1725. An autopsy revealed his bladder to be infected with gangrene. He was fifty-two years, seven months old when he died, having reigned forty-two years. He is interred in Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg, Russia.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-peter-the-great-put-a-tax-on-beards>Why did Peter the Great put a tax on beards?</h2>
<p>In 1698, Emperor Peter I of Russia instituted a beard tax to bring Russian society in line with Western European models. To enforce the ban on beards, the tsar empowered police to forcibly and publicly shave those who refused to pay the tax.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-peter-want-a-port-to-the-baltic-sea>Why did Peter want a port to the Baltic Sea?</h2>
<p>The only way Russia could move the goods to and from Europe was through Arkhangelsk port, high north on the White sea. It was very expensive and long path. Peter the Great thought that opening trade routes through Baltic sea would greatly benefit the Russia’s economy and overall development of the country.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-two-goals-of-peter-the-great>What were two goals of Peter the Great?</h2>
<p>Peter wanted a stronger military, to gain more land, and to centralize royal power. How he did this was by using western military techniques and winning the battle with Sweden. To control his power, he also made nobles serve in the state.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-peter-the-great-have-his-son-killed>Why did Peter the Great have his son killed?</h2>
<p>On 26 June (O.S.), Alexei died in the Peter and Paul fortress in Saint Petersburg, two days after the senate had condemned him to death for conspiring rebellion against his father, and for hoping for the cooperation of the common people and the armed intervention of his brother-in-law, the emperor.</p>
