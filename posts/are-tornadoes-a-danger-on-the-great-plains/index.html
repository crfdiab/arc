<h2 id=are-tornadoes-a-danger-on-the-great-plains>Are tornadoes a danger on the Great Plains?</h2>
<p>The Great Plains, the Midwest, the Mississippi Valley and the southern United States are all areas that are vulnerable to tornadoes. They are relatively rare west of the Rockies and are also less frequent in the northeastern states. Tornado Alley is a colloquial term for an area particularly prone to tornadoes.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-tornadoes-form-in-the-great-plains>How do tornadoes form in the Great Plains?</h2>
<p>Tornadoes are especially common over the Great Plains during the spring when cold Canadian air clashes with warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico. When these air masses collide over the Great Plains, the atmosphere becomes unstable and cause air to rise.</p>
<h2 id=what-regions-experience-tornadoes>What regions experience tornadoes?</h2>
<p>Other locations that experience frequent tornado occurrences include northern Europe, western Asia, Bangladesh, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, China, South Africa, and Argentina. In fact, the United Kingdom has more tornadoes, relative to its land area, than any other country.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-is-the-most-likely-time-to-see-a-tornado-in-the-great-plains>Which of the following is the most likely time to see a tornado in the Great Plains?</h2>
<p>Great Plains tornadoes commonly occur in late afternoon, when surface temperatures are the highest, providing the daily maximum uplift to the moist air near the ground.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-the-worst-tornadoes>Which country has the worst tornadoes?</h2>
<p>The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, as well as the strongest and most violent tornadoes. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States popularly known as Tornado Alley. Canada experiences the second most tornadoes.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-tornadoes-happen-in-the-great-plains>When do tornadoes happen in the Great Plains?</h2>
<p>Most tornadoes happen in the lengthy tornado season found within the Great Plains region from March until June – the infamous “tornado alley.” In this area, storms are caused when dry cold air moving south from Canada meets warm moist air travelling north from the Gulf of Mexico. Quite often, those tornadoes are large and violent.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-the-most-tornadoes-happen-in-the-united-states>Where do the most tornadoes happen in the United States?</h2>
<p>The United States, has over 1,200 tornadoes per year, enjoys the most prolific supercell and tornadic environment in the world. Most tornadoes happen in the lengthy tornado season found within the Great Plains region from March until June – the infamous “tornado alley.” In this area,…</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-states-that-are-in-tornado-alley>Are there any states that are in Tornado Alley?</h2>
<p>Though there is no definitive border to Tornado Alley, its core dominates the states of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and part of northern Texas, but high numbers of tornadoes can occur even in areas like Colorado, the Dakotas, and Florida.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-native-american-take-on-the-tornado>What’s the Native American take on the tornado?</h2>
<p>A Native American Take On Tornadoes. While tornadoes continue to tear across America’s midsection — taking lives and destroying property — we continue to search for explanations of the phenomenon, in hopes of developing better warning systems and protection. But after decades of research, funded by decamillions of dollars,…</p>
