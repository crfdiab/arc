<h2 id=what-did-the-naskapi-eat>What did the Naskapi eat?</h2>
<p>Innu hunted game animals like caribou in the eastern and northern areas, moose in the west, as well as beaver, bear, lake fish and salmon. In addition to hunting game, Innu fished for eels and fish, hunted seals, and gathered roots, berries and maple sap.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-naskapi-wear>What did the naskapi wear?</h2>
<p>Innu women wore long dresses with removable sleeves. Innu men wore breechclout and leggings. The Innus also wore knee high moccasins and long coats made of white leather. Innu people frequently painted their coats, leggings, and dresses with fancy black and red designs.</p>
<h2 id=is-naskapi-an-innu>Is naskapi an Innu?</h2>
<p>Innu, also called Montagnais and Naskapi, North American Indian peoples who spoke almost identical Algonquian dialects and whose cultures differed chiefly in their adaptation to their respective environments.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-innu-people-believe-in>What did the Innu people believe in?</h2>
<p>The ancestors of the Innu probably made caribou skin clothing. Innu women wore long dresses with removable sleeves while the men wore breechclout leggings, but during historic times they were especially known for their painted jackets and long coats.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-innu-believe-in>What did the Innu believe in?</h2>
<p>The Innu believe that the universe is alive with powerful spiritual forces which are able to profoundly affect their lives. Recognising their power is as essential for survival as understanding the weather or changing seasons.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-innu-government>What was the Innu Government?</h2>
<p>The Innu Nation’s mandate is to provide a unified political voice to protect the Innu people’s interests against outside threats, as well as to pursue land claim negotiations and help deliver education, health-care, and other social services to its membership.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-did-the-northern-innu-eat>What kind of food did the Northern Innu eat?</h2>
<p>The northern Innu, or Naskapi, lived on the vast Labrador plateau of grasslands and tundra, hunted caribou for both food and skins to cover their wickiups, and supplemented their diet with fish and small game. The name Montagnais is French, meaning “mountaineers”; Naskapi is an indigenous name thought to….</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-naskapi-live-during-the-summer>Where did the Naskapi live during the summer?</h2>
<p>None of the Innu lived in modern houses but instead camped in tents near North West River, Nain and Davis Inlet (all Inuit settlements) during the summer. Between 1831 and 1956, the Naskapi were subjected to several major relocations, all of which reflected not their needs nor interests, but those of the Hudson’s Bay Company. The major moves were:</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-does-the-bantu-tribe-eat>What kind of food does the Bantu tribe eat?</h2>
<p>The Bantu catch fish for themselves from the Juba River and occasionally buy or trade for ghee, milk, and meat in the market from the nomads. They normally eat three meals a day. Breakfast often includes coffee with bananas, sweet potatoes, or yam. For lunch, they may eat boiled corn and beans mixed with sesame oil and tea.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-so-many-people-die-from-the-naskapi>Why did so many people die from the Naskapi?</h2>
<p>In several instances, individual managers, apparently dissatisfied with the Naskapi’ seeming lack of commitment to trapping withheld from them the ammunition that they needed to hunt for food, thereby directly causing a considerable number of deaths from starvation.</p>
