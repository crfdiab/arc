<h2 id=who-court-martialed-benedict-arnold>Who court martialed Benedict Arnold?</h2>
<p>The British already held control of New York City and believed that by taking West Point they could effectively cut off the Americans’ New England forces from the rest of the fledgling nation. In August 1780, Sir Henry Clinton offered Arnold £20,000 for delivering West Point and 3,000 troops.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-benedict-arnolds-leg>What happened to Benedict Arnold’s leg?</h2>
<p>On the grounds of the Saratoga National Historic Park, there rests a monument to Benedict Arnold’s leg. It sits on the spot where Arnold fell wounded during the Battle of Freeman’s Farm. The leg was severely wounded, bleeding copiously, and pinned beneath Arnold’s own horse. It survived the battle and the war.</p>
<h2 id=did-benedict-arnold-have-a-fake-leg>Did Benedict Arnold have a fake leg?</h2>
<p>The injuries left him with a permanent limp and one leg that was two inches shorter than the other, but they also cemented his reputation as a courageous field commander. Even British Secretary of State Lord Germaine was quoted as calling Arnold “the most enterprising and dangerous” of all the American generals.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-british-general-who-captured-richmond>Who was the British general who captured Richmond?</h2>
<p>Benedict Arnold captures and destroys Richmond. American traitor and British Brigadier General Benedict Arnold enjoys his greatest success as a British commander on this day in 1781. Arnold’s 1,600 largely Loyalist troops sailed up the James River at the beginning of January, eventually landing in Westover, Virginia.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-john-champe-in-to-catch-a-traitor>Who is John Champe in to catch a traitor?</h2>
<p>To Catch a Traitor: John Champe Pursues Benedict Arnold Sergeant Major John Champe races away from the Continental Army’s lines, chased by his fellow soldiers. His defection was a ruse, part of a secret mission to capture Benedict Arnold. (Currier & Ives/World History Group Archive)</p>
<h2 id=who-was-in-charge-of-the-invasion-of-canada>Who was in charge of the invasion of Canada?</h2>
<p>On June 27, 1775, the Continental Congress authorized the invasion of Quebec partly at the urging of Arnold. But Congress gave General Philip Schuyler the command. Arnold was passed over but not pacified. He proposed a second invasion of Canada to General George Washington to lead a second expedition to attack via a wilderness route.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-dirk-benedict-in-battlestar-galactica>Who was Dirk Benedict in Battlestar Galactica?</h2>
<p>Dirk Benedict is an actor best known for his roles on ‘The A-Team’ and ‘Battlestar Galactica.’ Nathan Hale was an American soldier during the Revolutionary War and was hanged by the British for espionage in 1776. Ethan Allen led the Green Mountain Boys to capture Fort Ticonderoga during the American Revolutionary War.</p>
