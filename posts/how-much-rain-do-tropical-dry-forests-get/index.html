<h2 id=how-much-rain-do-tropical-dry-forests-get>How much rain do tropical dry forests get?</h2>
<p>Tropical dry forest can be defined as forest in frost-free regions with annual precipitation between 500-2000 mm and a pronounced dry season of four to seven months with less than 50 mm of precipitation.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-tropical-dry-rainforest>What is a tropical dry rainforest?</h2>
<p>The tropical and subtropical dry forest is a habitat type defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature and is located at tropical and subtropical latitudes. Deciduous trees predominate in most of these forests, and during the drought a leafless period occurs, which varies with species type.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-climate-of-a-tropical-dry-forest>What is the climate of a tropical dry forest?</h2>
<p>Dry forests in which most trees lose their leaves in the dry season receive 32-71 in of rain a year, with 5 consecutive months averaging less than 4 inches each. Monthly temperatures average above 64.4° F all year long. Most have closed canopies that are deciduous during the dry season.</p>
<h2 id=in-what-kind-of-place-do-tropical-dry-forests-grow>In what kind of place do tropical dry forests grow?</h2>
<p>Tropical and Subtropical Dry Forests are found in southern Mexico, southeastern Africa, the Lesser Sundas, central India, Indochina, Madagascar, New Caledonia, eastern Bolivia and central Brazil, the Caribbean, valleys of the northern Andes, and along the coasts of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-endangered-species-in-the-tropical-dry-forest>What is the most endangered species in the tropical dry forest?</h2>
<p>Dry forests are also an important habitat for endangered species, eg: Giraffe, Komodo Dragon, Sloth Bear, Kingfishers.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-temperature-in-a-tropical-dry-forest>What is the average temperature in a tropical dry forest?</h2>
<p>A: The average temperature in a tropical dry forest is approximately 63 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures are generally higher during most months of the year in these regions.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-rain-does-a-tropical-rain-forest-get>How much rain does a tropical rain forest get?</h2>
<p>On average, 10 to 80 inches of rain fall each year in the wet season. Plants and animals that live in these regions have several adaptations to withstand the climate extremes.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-driest-season-in-the-amazon-rainforest>When is the driest season in the Amazon rainforest?</h2>
<p>The driest season comes between June and August with an average rainfall of approximately 6 inches. The huge amount of rainfall experienced in the Amazon in the course of the wet season results in dramatic rise in river water level throughout the forest ecosystem. This leads to extensiveflooding.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-highest-rainfall-in-a-month-in-the-world>Which is the highest rainfall in a month in the world?</h2>
<p>The village also holds the world record for the highest rainfall received in a calendar month after it received 370 inches of rainfall in July 1861. Like Mawsynram, Sohra lies in a region with a subtropical highland climate which is characterized by long wet season and a brief dry spell.</p>
