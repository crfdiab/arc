<h2 id=when-did-science-and-technology-develop-in-mesopotamia>When did science and technology develop in Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>The Sumerians first explored the practice of the scientific hypothesis. Mesopotamian science and technology developed during the Uruk Period (4100-2900 BCE) and Early Dynastic Period (2900-1750 BCE) of the Sumerian culture of southern Mesopotamia.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-important-invention-in-mesopotamia>What was the most important invention in Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>The two Mesopotamian inventions considered most important are writing and the wheel. Although some scholars contend that the wheel originated in Central Asia (because the oldest wheel in the world was found there), it is generally accepted that the concept originated in Sumer because of the production of ceramics.</p>

<h2 id=why-was-the-potters-wheel-important-to-ancient-mesopotamia>Why was the potter’s wheel important to ancient Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>The wheel is thought to have developed from a need to make better, and more, pottery in less time. The potter’s wheel was then adapted for the creation of carts, and later chariots, for transporting goods and simply moving more quickly from one place to another.</p>
