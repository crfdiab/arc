<p>Shahid Afridi (Pakistan) And he is still known for his longest sixes in cricket history. His unpredictable performances always leave a path of destruction, but his irregular innings of substance are what make him stand out. However, Afridi is known as one of the most dangerous hard hitters in cricket history.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-best-all-rounder-in-world-cup-cricket>Who is the best all rounder in World Cup cricket?</h2>
<p>Most of the teams look forward to having a set of quality all-rounder because it helps them to enjoy a comfortable room to switch in both bowling and batting departments.

<p>1 of 10 We begin our list with England’s hero of the 2000’s, Andrew Flintoff, or as he’s better known, Freddy Flintoff.

Marcus Stoinis is a well-known all-rounder, who has displayed his capabilities during IPL 2019.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-all-rounder-in-test-cricket>Who was the first all rounder in Test cricket?</h2>
<p>Keith Miller The great Australian all-rounder of the post-war era, Keith Miller was test cricket’s first true all-rounder. He was perhaps best remembered as a fast opening bowler, forming a partnership with Ray Lindwall, recognised as one of the great test-match opening bowling pairs.</p>
