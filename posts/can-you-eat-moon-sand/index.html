<h2 id=can-you-eat-moon-sand>Can you eat moon sand?</h2>
<p>It’s so soft! There are 2 ways to make this sand: edible or regular. For babies or toddlers who put everything in their mouth… like my child, you’ll want to do the edible version so they don’t get sick if they spend the entirety of craft time trying to shovel it into their mouths.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-moon-sand-made-out-of>What is moon sand made out of?</h2>
<p>WHAT IS MOON SAND? Moon sand is an unique but simple mixture of sand, cornstarch, and water. It can be packed together for great sand castles, formed into mounds and mountains and molded. It stays moist while you play and doesn’t harden like clay!</p>
<h2 id=is-moon-sand-safe-for-babies>Is Moon Sand safe for babies?</h2>
<p>I have also made moon sand with coconut oil. This makes is a “taste safe” version for smaller babies.</p>
<h2 id=is-kinetic-sand-toxic-if-swallowed>Is kinetic sand toxic if swallowed?</h2>
<p>Kinetic sand is a fun sensory toy. It is made of 98% ultra-fine grain sand combined with 2% dimethicone (polydimethylsiloxane). Sand is not poisonous when swallowed. While kinetic sand won’t poison a person if they eat it, it does pose a choking hazard, and if large amounts are eaten it can cause constipation.</p>
<h2 id=does-moon-sand-expire>Does Moon Sand expire?</h2>
<p>Moon sand does keep for a solid month or two, but you’ll probably find that you want to make more anyway before the first batch gets old. But until then, store this batch in an air-tight container in a cool, dry place, like your pantry or in a child’s toy box.</p>
<h2 id=does-moon-sand-expire-1>Does moon sand expire?</h2>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-moon-sand-and-kinetic-sand>What’s the difference between moon sand and kinetic sand?</h2>
<p>There are two major difference between moon sand and kinetic sand: Kinetic sand is simply regular sand that has been coated with silicon oil. Its texture is more silky, whereas moon sand feels more crumbly. When you build with kinetic sand, you will find that the structure starts to fall apart within seconds.</p>
<h2 id=is-kinetic-sand-toxic-to-children>Is kinetic sand toxic to children?</h2>
<p>Kinetic Sand is Non-Toxic. It has been tested for all required safety standards. Kinetic Sand is a modelling compound and is not intended for consumption. As with all toys, children under 3 years should be supervised at all times whilst playing with Kinetic Sand.</p>
<h2 id=can-kinetic-sand-get-wet>Can kinetic sand get wet?</h2>
<p>Don’t worry if Kinetic Sand™ has gotten wet, simply spread it out on a flat surface to dry and it will return to its original state.</p>
<h2 id=can-kinetic-sand-be-sanitized>Can kinetic sand be sanitized?</h2>
<p>As for its sanitization, yes, you can sanitize your kinetic sand by spreading it out and spraying it with a mist sanitizer. After that, you need to air dry it.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-for-kids-to-use-moon-sand>Is it safe for kids to use Moon Sand?</h2>
<p>Moon Sand has been around for a while now and it is ever growing in popularity. But many people are still wondering what exactly it is. Will it be safe for your children?</p>
<h2 id=how-is-moon-sand-used-in-real-life>How is Moon Sand used in real life?</h2>
<p>If you want a few more technical details we can tell you that the sand is coated in a hydrophobic compound which means the grains of stand stick to each other and bond together. This means the sand can be used in moulds to create blocks or other fun designs. The ingredients are pretty simple, just ordinary sand with a few extras.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-sand-is-safe-for-children>What kind of sand is safe for children?</h2>
<p>So the inventors came up with the idea of Moon Sand, a mouldable sand that never dries out. This is designed to be safe for children and reusable as long as it is safely stored.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-oil-do-you-use-for-moon-sand>What kind of oil do you use for Moon Sand?</h2>
<p>Instead of using vegetable oil you can use baby oil. This is my favourite moon sand recipe because the baby oil is not too greasy and makes it fun for children to mix it using their hands. Mix step 3 until the oil is mixed with the food coloring and essential oil Note : For every 4 cup of flour add 1/2 cup of baby oil.</p>
