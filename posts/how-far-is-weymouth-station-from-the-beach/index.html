<p>Dorset<br>
Weymouth Bay is a sheltered bay on the south coast of England, in Dorset. It is protected from erosion by Chesil Beach and the Isle of Portland, and includes several beaches, notably Weymouth Beach, a gently curving arc of golden sand which stretches from the resort of Weymouth.</p>
<h2 id=is-weymouth-worth-visiting>Is Weymouth worth visiting?</h2>
<p>Weymouth is about three and a half hours on the train from London, and it’s completely worth a visit. It’s not only a great value destination, it’s also surrounded by beauty spots. And with plenty of sun and hidden gems to discover, it’s perfect for a summer staycation.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-weymouth-or-bournemouth>Which is better Weymouth or Bournemouth?</h2>
<p>Weymouth also looks more central for exploring the Dorset coast in general, ie, the Jurassic coast to the west and Durdle Door, Lulworth Cove etc to the east. All that said, Bournemouth looks like it might be a better bet for a family holiday, with its bigger beach etc but self catering seems more expensive.</p>
