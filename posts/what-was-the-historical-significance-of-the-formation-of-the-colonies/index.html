<p>As a result, for the most part, the English colonies in North America were business ventures. They provided an outlet for England’s surplus population and (in some cases) more religious freedom than England did, but their primary purpose was to make money for their sponsors.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-colonial-settlements-on-the-native-americans>What was the impact of colonial settlements on the Native Americans?</h2>
<p>European colonization of North America had a devastating effect on the native population. Within a short period of time their way of life was changed forever. The changes were caused by a number of factors, including loss of land, disease, enforced laws which violated their culture and much more.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-three-impacts-of-colonization>What were three impacts of colonization?</h2>
<p>(2010) further expands on the direct confrontations of colonialism by stating, “[T]he impacts of colonialism were similar, regardless of the specific colonizer: disease; destruction of indigenous social, political, and economic structures; repression; exploitation; land displacement; and land degradation” (p. 37).</p>

<p>But it also has negative impacts, for example loss of culture, loss of land, unfamiliar system of government, lack of respect for traditions…etc. Therefore sometimes the colonialism may lead to imperialism, which is the policy of one country or empire extending the rule of authority over other territories or states.</p>

European goods, ideas, and diseases shaped the changing continent. As Europeans established their colonies,…</p>

<p>Soon, beavers were extinct in New England, New York, and other areas. With their loss came the loss of beaver ponds, which had served as habitats for fish as well as water sources for deer, moose, and other animals. Furthermore, Europeans introduced pigs, which they allowed to forage in forests and other wildlands.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-colonizers-take-advantage-of-natural-resources>How did the colonizers take advantage of Natural Resources?</h2>
<p>Colonizers established fields, fences, and other means of demarcating private property. Native peoples who moved seasonally to take advantage of natural resources now found areas off limits, claimed by colonizers because of their insistence on private-property rights.</p>
