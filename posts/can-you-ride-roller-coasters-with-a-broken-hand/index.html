<h2 id=can-you-ride-roller-coasters-with-a-broken-hand>Can you ride roller coasters with a broken hand?</h2>
<p>Riders with one missing arm or hand may ride, provided rider has ability to hold on with one functioning hand and brace themselves with two functioning legs. Riders must have control of their leg(s). Riders with arm or leg casts shall not ride.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-go-on-rides-at-universal-with-a-cast>Can you go on rides at Universal with a cast?</h2>
<p>Attraction is not allowed for Guests wearing casts. Attraction is not allowed for Guests with recent surgery or other conditions that may be aggravated by this ride. Guests must be able to transfer to the ride vehicle seating with assistance from another member of their party.</p>
<h2 id=has-anyone-ever-died-at-universal-studios>Has anyone ever died at Universal Studios?</h2>
<p>On September 23, 2003, a 34-year-old from Jensen Beach, Florida, suffered a heart attack from an unknown heart condition while riding The Incredible Hulk coaster. She was rushed to Sand Lake Hospital in critical condition, but never regained consciousness and died shortly after being taken off of life support.</p>

<h2 id=who-should-not-ride-roller-coasters>Who should not ride roller coasters?</h2>
<p>But people with high blood pressure, a previous heart attack, an implanted pacemaker or defibrillator, and others with proven heart disease, should not ride a roller coaster, researchers said. Kuschyk also suggested that operators of roller coasters have an external defibrillator on hand.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-get-on-a-roller-coaster-with-a-cast>Can I get on a roller coaster with a cast?</h2>
<p>Guests with casts below the elbow or knee are permitted to ride some rides as long as they do not get in the way of the ride’s safety devices, other rides do not allow casts at all.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-weight-limit-for-universal-studios>What is the weight limit for Universal Studios?</h2>
<p>Keep in mind there are no “weight restrictions” on any of Universal’s theme-park attractions; instead, it comes down to how your unique body dimensions fit inside each ride’s restraint system. Two people may weigh the same, but one will fit and the other will not – which is why the test seats are so important.</p>

<h2 id=universal-orlandos-horror-make-up-show-is-the-jaws-ride-still-at-universal-studios>Universal Orlando’s Horror Make-Up Show™ Is the Jaws ride still at Universal Studios?</h2>
<p>There’s no need for that ominous “Jaws” music. The large figure, which dangles from a frame on a dock in the San Francisco area of the park, isn’t currently hanging there. It’s backstage undergoing maintenance and will be returning, Universal Orlando confirmed.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-restraints-at-universal-studios-florida>Where are the restraints at Universal Studios Florida?</h2>
<p>The vast majority of the time, the problem concerns the restraint system. Let’s take a look at this issue in detail, shall we? Located near the attraction entrance, each of Universal’s thrill rides has a mock-up of the seats and restraints used in the ride vehicle.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-buckle-seat-belts-at-universal-studios>Do you have to buckle seat belts at Universal Studios?</h2>
<p>If you can buckle the test seat’s straps easily, you should be able to ride in the modified seats with no problem. If you fit, but just barely, you’ll need the help of another party member. Make sure you get seated first and have your companion push the restraint down enough until you can get it buckled.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-have-a-hand-tattoo-at-universal-studios>Can you have a hand tattoo at Universal Studios?</h2>
<p>But face tattoos and hand tattoos are strictly prohibited. And get this: they can’t be covered by makeup either. That means that if you have a face tattoo, then you are not allowed to work for Universal, at all.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-difficult-to-get-out-of-universal-studios-ride>Why is it difficult to get out of Universal Studios ride?</h2>
<p>The problem occurs when you try to get out. The constant deluge of water makes the ride vehicle floors very slippery; when you attempt to exit the vehicle, you may have great difficulty, as I do, because the opening can be very tight for a large person, and it’s almost impossible to get your feet under your body to lift with your legs.</p>
