<h2 id=who-claimed-the-territory-of-the-ohio-river-valley>Who claimed the territory of the Ohio River Valley?</h2>
<p>The French and Indian War, the North American phase of the larger Seven Years’ War, began after a series of incidents in the upper Ohio River valley, which the French and British governments both claimed as their territory.</p>
<h2 id=who-wanted-the-land-around-the-ohio-river>Who wanted the land around the Ohio River?</h2>
<p>The British colonists thought the Ohio River Valley belonged to them. Virginia’s charter granted it land all the way to the Pacific Ocean. At the start of the French and Indian war, the British had more than 1 million colonists. And the population in the colonies was quickly growing.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-claimed-the-territory-north-of-the-ohio-river>Which country claimed the territory north of the Ohio River?</h2>
<p>Britain officially ceded the area north of the Ohio River and west of the Appalachians to the United States at the end of the American Revolutionary War with the Treaty of Paris (1783), but the British continued to maintain a presence in the region as late as 1815, the end of the War of 1812.</p>
<h2 id=who-owned-the-territory-around-the-mississippi-and-ohio-river-after-1763>Who owned the territory around the Mississippi and Ohio River after 1763?</h2>
<p>France and Great Britain fought the French and Indian War (1753-1763) over this area in the mid-18th century, as the North American front of their Seven Years’ War. After the British won, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to the British in the 1763 Treaty of Paris.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-ohio-river-so-important>Why was the Ohio River so important?</h2>
<p>During the 1800s, the Ohio River became an important commercial route for residents in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois. Farmers and manufacturers sent their crops and finished products on flatboats and barges downstream to the Mississippi River and eventually on to New Orleans.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-claim-the-ohio-country>Why did the British claim the Ohio country?</h2>
<p>To prevent bloodshed and to reduce military expenses, England issued the Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited their colonists from living west of the Appalachian Mountains. A major reason for the French and Indian War had been the colonists’ desire for access to the fertile Ohio Country lands.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-state-to-claim-the-ohio-river>Who was the first state to claim the Ohio River?</h2>
<p>In essence, the boundary between Kentucky and these three future states would be the low point of the Ohio River’s northernmost bank. Both Indiana and Ohio have sought to claim the Ohio River, despite the federal government’s declaration in 1792.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-settlement-in-the-ohio-country>Where was the first settlement in the Ohio Country?</h2>
<p>Northwest Ordinance and settlement. Its civil government was to be under the jurisdiction of the Congress. Pioneers to the Ohio Country arrived at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers on April 7, 1788, and established Marietta, Ohio as the first permanent American settlement in the Territory.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-northwest-territory-become-the-state-of-ohio>When did the Northwest Territory become the state of Ohio?</h2>
<p>In July 1787, most of Ohio Country, the southern peninsula of what is today the state of Michigan, and western Illinois Country were incorporated as the Northwest Territory. In 1803, most of what was formerly Ohio country north and west of the Ohio River was admitted to the union as the state of Ohio.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-french-and-the-english-claim-for-ohio>What did the French and the English claim for Ohio?</h2>
<p>Both the French and the English claimed possession of Ohio, the French claim resting on La Salle’s exploration, while the British claimed all territory extending westward from their coastal colonies.</p>
