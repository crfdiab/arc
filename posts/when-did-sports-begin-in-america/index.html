<h2 id=when-did-sports-begin-in-america>When did sports begin in America?</h2>
<p>Native American peoples played a variety of ball games including some that may be viewed as earlier forms of lacrosse. The typical American sports of baseball, basketball ad football, however, arose from games that were brought to America by the first settlers that arrived from Europe in the 17th century.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-they-start-sports>When did they start sports?</h2>
<p>It was predictably in Greece that sports were first instituted formally, with the first Olympic Games recorded in 776 BCE in Olympia, where they were celebrated until 393 CE. These games took place every four years, or Olympiad, which became a unit of time in historical chronologies.</p>
<h2 id=what-sports-were-in-early-america>What sports were in early America?</h2>
<p>Colonists had brought with them European games and sports such as bowling, football, cricket, quoits, and cards. Some of these activities, such as cricket and football, fell out of use as they did not require the kinds of skills the colonists needed in their everyday lives.</p>
<h2 id=which-sport-is-the-oldest-in-the-world>Which sport is the oldest in the world?</h2>
<p>Wrestling<br>
Wrestling is regarded the oldest sports in the world and we have proof. The famous cave paintings in Lascaux, France, dating back to 15,300 years ago, depict wrestlers.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-sports-take-place-in-colonial-america>When did sports take place in colonial America?</h2>
<p>In colonial America, sports or games would only take place when certain factors fell in line with one another. These factors included times of increased wealth, populations, and growth of cities. Sports or games were commonly played during holidays or celebrations (Christmas, Easter, Sundays, etc).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-games-did-people-play-in-colonial-america>What kind of games did people play in colonial America?</h2>
<p>History of Sports in Colonial America. Some games that were played included: stool ball, foot races, quoits (similar to horse shoes), and skittles and nine pins (bowling). These games allowed single men to show off and impress women at the same time. They also loved to participate in violent games or sports.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-football-so-popular-in-the-colonies>Why was football so popular in the colonies?</h2>
<p>Football was also very popular (their version is not at all like the modern day version). Sports events or games allowed for colonists to “escape” some of the hardships of daily life (diseases, famine, work). They also allowed for mating rituals and courtship. These games also allowed for people to express their anger in a socially acceptable way.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-children-do-for-fun-in-colonial-times>What did children do for fun in colonial times?</h2>
<p>Colonial children did not have much freedom to play. Children were expected to pull their weight with work around the house and to make money. Children still managed to have some fun, however. Colonial children enjoyed games just like children of today, but the games often were drastically different than modern children’s games. Active Games</p>
