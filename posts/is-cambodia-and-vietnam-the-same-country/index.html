<p>September 1989<br>
This is the decade after Vietnamese troops expelled the Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh, on January 7, 1979. For another 10 years, Cambodia was run virtually as a Vietnamese colony, until September 1989, when the last Vietnamese troops left Cambodia.</p>
<h2 id=is-vietnam-cheaper-than-cambodia>Is Vietnam cheaper than Cambodia?</h2>

These differences become even more noticable if you plan to spend a longer time in the country. 10 days, two weeks, or even one month of travel to Cambodia or Vietnam can really add to your travel budget.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-vietnam-do-to-cambodia>What did Vietnam do to Cambodia?</h2>
<p>Vietnam launched an invasion of Cambodia in late December 1978 to remove Pol Pot. Two million Cambodians had died at the hands of his Khmer Rouge regime and Pol Pot’s troops had conducted bloody cross-border raids into Vietnam, Cambodia’s historic enemy, massacring civilians and torching villages.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-vietnam-go-to-war-with-cambodia>Why did Vietnam go to war with Cambodia?</h2>
<h2 id=why-did-vietnam-fight-cambodia>Why did Vietnam fight Cambodia?</h2>
<p>1. The War started because Cambodia repeatedly invaded Vietnam, attempting to retake the Mekong River Delta. The country felt the area belonged to them and continuously raided Vietnamese areas on the border. Also, the Cambodian troops exterminated the Vietnamese living within Cambodia.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-need-a-visa-to-go-from-vietnam-to-cambodia>Do I need a visa to go from Vietnam to Cambodia?</h2>
<p>At land crossing from Thailand, Vietnam and Laos, visa can be obtained at International Check Point border. A passport and visa are required. Tourists and business travelers may purchase a Cambodian visa valid for one month at the airports in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap and borders.</p>
<h2 id=is-vietnam-safer-than-cambodia>Is Vietnam safer than Cambodia?</h2>
<p>Vietnam or Cambodia – Dangers & Annoyances Vietnam is an overall safer place with fewer scams and annoyances to watch out for. Both countries are perfectly safe for travellers and most scams are avoided just by being smart and aware.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-month-to-go-to-cambodia>What is the best month to go to Cambodia?</h2>
<p>The best time to visit Cambodia is between November and April, when it sees very little rain. During this time you’ll see clear blue skies making it a great time to enjoy a relaxing getaway on the southern coast.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-of-a-country-is-cambodia-compared-to-vietnam>How big of a country is Cambodia compared to Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Cambodia is a small nation of some 180,000 square kilometres, lying south-west of Vietnam and also sharing borders with Thailand and Laos. Like Vietnam, Cambodia had been a French colony until the mid-20th century. By 1960, Cambodia’s population was around six and a half million people, the majority of whom were peasant farmers.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-country-to-the-east-of-cambodia>Which is the country to the east of Cambodia?</h2>
<p>To the east of Cambodia lies the long, thin country of Vietnam. Bordered to the southwest by Cambodia, and with Laos to the west and China to the north, Vietnam has one of the longest coastlines in south-central Asia. And it is this long, beautiful coast that is a major attraction for tourists.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-cambodia-become-a-protectorate-of-vietnam>When did Cambodia become a protectorate of Vietnam?</h2>
<p>In 1813, Nak Ong Chan gained the Cambodian throne with the help of Vietnam, and under his rule Cambodia became a protectorate. Following his death in 1834, Vietnam colonised Cambodia; it was governed under a Vietnamese administration and termed a Vietnamese “province”.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-people-of-vietnam-and-cambodia-come-from>Where did the people of Vietnam and Cambodia come from?</h2>
<p>Both the Vietnamese and the Khmer (Cambodian) peoples descended from ancient Austroasiatic-speaking peoples who settled throughout the eastern and southeastern regions of Indochina.</p>
