<h2 id=why-was-the-decision-to-drop-the-atomic-bomb-made>Why was the decision to drop the atomic bomb made?</h2>
<p>For President Truman, the decision was a clear-cut one. In 1945, America was weary of war. Japan was a hated enemy. The nation feared the cost of invading the Japanese mainland. As visitors walk through this section, an audio loop program plays throughout the space with veteran testimonies about the end of the war.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-atomic-bomb-on-japan>What was the impact of the atomic bomb on Japan?</h2>
<p>For the cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, this is certainly what the atomic bombs brought. By the time of the bombing of Hiroshima, many of Japan’s large cities had been attacked severely by American air power.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-when-the-atomic-bomb-was-dropped-on-japan>Who was president when the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan?</h2>
<p>On August 9, the day the Nagasaki bomb was dropped, Truman received a telegram from Samuel McCrea Cavert, a Protestant clergyman, who pleaded with the president to stop the bombing “before any further devastation by atomic bomb is visited upon her [Japan’s]…</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-were-saved-by-dropping-the-atomic-bomb>How many people were saved by dropping the atomic bomb?</h2>
<p>After the war, government officials, facing criticism for their decision to use the bomb, suggested that between 500,000 and 1 million Americans, and several million Japanese, were saved by dropping the bombs that completely destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-justified-in-dropping-the-atomic-bomb-on-japan>Who was justified in dropping the atomic bomb on Japan?</h2>
<p>President Truman was entirely justified in deciding to drop the Atomic Bombs on Japan. In any war, opposing nations killed enemy troops, decimated enemy cities into rubbles, and dropped bombs.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-at-the-time-of-the-atomic-bomb>Who was president at the time of the atomic bomb?</h2>
<p>Less than two weeks after being sworn in as president, Harry S. Truman received a long report from Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson. “Within four months,” it began, “we shall in all probability have completed the most terrible weapon ever known in human history.”</p>

<p>In March 1945, over 100,000 civilians were killed, and another 1 million left homeless, when B-29s dropped a firebomb assault on the city. The government of Japan didn’t blink an eye when that happened. Only the shock of the atomic impact, with its ability to instantly wipe any city off the map, was enough to create movement toward peace. 4.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-responsible-for-the-development-of-the-atomic-bomb>Who was responsible for the development of the atomic bomb?</h2>
<p>Most of the scientists, civilian leaders, and military officials responsible for the development of the bomb clearly assumed that its military use, however unpleasant, was the inevitable outcome of the project.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-president-when-the-atomic-bomb-was-dropped-on-hiroshima>Who was president when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima?</h2>
<p>Today, Barack Obama will be visiting Hiroshima, the first sitting US president to do so since the horrific events of August 1945. The White House has made clear that Obama “will not revisit the decision to use the atomic bomb,” nor will any apology be forthcoming.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-controversy-over-the-atomic-bomb>What was the controversy over the atomic bomb?</h2>
<p>A national controversy over the decision to use the atomic bomb erupted in the mid-1990s, when the Smithsonian Institution made changes to a proposed exhibit featuring the Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the Hiroshima bomb. As originally planned, the exhibit would have included criticism of the decision to drop the bomb.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-in-charge-of-the-atomic-bomb-project>Who was in charge of the atomic bomb project?</h2>
<p>The only decision Truman made was not to alter the plan. The project to build the bomb began with a 1939 letter from Albert Einstein to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, confiding that a fission chain reaction of uranium could produce a very powerful bomb and warning that German scientists were at work on building one for the Nazi government.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-secretary-of-war-when-the-bomb-was-dropped>Who was the Secretary of War when the bomb was dropped?</h2>
<p>The closest thing to such a document is this handwritten order, addressed to Secretary of War Henry Stimson, in which Truman authorized the release of a public statement about the use of the bomb. It was written on July 31, 1945 while Truman was attending the Potsdam Conference in Germany.</p>
