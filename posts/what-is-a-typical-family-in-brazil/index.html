<h2 id=what-is-a-typical-family-in-brazil>What is a typical family in Brazil?</h2>
<p>In cities such as Rio, a typical Brazilian family consists of a husband and wife and their two children. Many households today have two parents that work outside the home, so the extended family, which includes cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, godparents (‘padrinhos’) and close friends, all help with childcare.</p>
<h2 id=is-brazils-population-small>Is Brazil’s population small?</h2>
<p>Most of Brazil is sparsely populated with a population density of 24.66 people per square kilometer (62 per square mile). The largest city is Sao Paulo with more than 11.9 million residents and a metropolitan population of 21.1 million. The capital, Brasilia, has a population of 2.8 million.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-life-like-as-a-kid-in-brazil>What is life like as a kid in Brazil?</h2>
<p>North Brazil is known for its poverty. In these regions, children often live in the street and, as a result, are confronted with violence on a daily basis. Their environment is deplorable, with child trafficking, drugs, prostitution, hard labour, begging, and sexual exploitation representing daily challenges.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-family-values-in-brazil>What are family values in Brazil?</h2>
<p>In Brazil, personal values are important. In their relationships and families, people appreciate honesty, respect, trust and patience. Warmth and compassion are valued among families, along with respect for all family members, including children.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-family-do-people-in-brazil-have>What kind of family do people in Brazil have?</h2>
<p>In the past, Brazilian families tended to be large. When a couple married, the individuality of that couple as a new household was recognized and respected. However, newly married couples were also expected to maintain close family ties and proximity with their extended family, including godparents and godchildren.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-so-many-people-live-in-the-same-home-in-brazil>Why do so many people live in the same home in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Whilst Brazilian families are traditionally quite large, this is gradually changing with the shift from a collectivist to an individualist society. One reason why several generations continue to live in the same home in modern society is to reduce living expenses, particularly rental costs.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-family-structure-changed-in-brazil>How is the family structure changed in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Families are also moving to urban areas for more career opportunities and living away from extended family. With the societal changes that have touched Brazilian culture, the family structure has somewhat changed, but the values that encourage close family ties remain.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-generations-does-a-brazilian-family-have>How many generations does a Brazilian family have?</h2>
<p>This is when parents choose additional friends and organisations to be a part of their family, such as parent-teacher associations. It is common to find three generations living under one roof in a Brazilian home.</p>
