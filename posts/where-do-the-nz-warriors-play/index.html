New Zealand Warriors/Locations</p>
<p>The New Zealand Warriors are a professional rugby league football club based in Auckland, New Zealand that competes in the National Rugby League (NRL) premiership and is the League’s only team from outside Australia.</p>
<h2 id=have-the-warriors-won-the-nrl>Have the Warriors won the NRL?</h2>
<p>The Vodafone Warriors have reached the NRL grand final twice (2002 and 2011), won the minor premiership in 2002, qualified for the finals eight times and netted the now-defunct National Youth Competition (under-20) title three times (2010, 2011 and 2014).</p>

<p>Central Coast<br>
The Warriors have decided to continue to be based on the Central Coast for the remainder of the 2021 NRL season. But while the team and staff won’t be relocating to Auckland, there is still hope of playing games in New Zealand this year, with a couple of ideas being worked through.</p>

<h2 id=how-long-is-a-game-of-rugby-league>How long is a game of rugby league?</h2>
<p>Individual matches are adjudicated by a referee supported by one “touch” (or sideline) judge on either side of the field. A match consists of two 40-minute halves. In rugby union a team fields 15 players; in rugby league teams field 13 players.</p>

Golden State Warriors/Locations<br>
The Golden State Warriors reside in San Francisco now, but for many of the players and coaches who brought championships to the Bay Area in recent years, the connection to Oakland — the city where the team played for 47 years and recently went to five straight NBA Finals inside Oracle Arena — remains stronger than …</p>

<h2 id=which-nrl-team-is-the-oldest>Which NRL team is the oldest?</h2>
<p>South Sydney<br>
While South Sydney is the oldest current club in the League, having been established a week earlier than “Easts”, the Rabbitohs sat out the 2000 & 2001 seasons (excluded as part of the rationalisation after the Super League war), leaving the Roosters as the club with the longest continuous history in the competition.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-new-zealand-warriors-in-the-nrl>Who are the New Zealand Warriors in the NRL?</h2>
<p>Another New Zealand Warriors star has agreed to terms with the club and will remain in the side’s ranks for at least the next two seasons. A shootout between two of the hottest young properties in the NRL has been decided by a jawdropping slice of Valentine Holmes madness.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-the-new-zealand-warriors-play-their-home-games>Where do the New Zealand Warriors play their home games?</h2>
<p>Whilst they are based at Mt Smart Stadium in the Auckland suburb of Penrose, they are currently based on the Central Coast in New South Wales playing home games at Central Coast Stadium .</p>
<h2 id=when-do-new-zealand-warriors-play-the-rabbitohs>When do New Zealand Warriors play the Rabbitohs?</h2>
<p>And another thing The Warriors will return to the Sunshine Coast to play the Rabbitohs in 2021 after the fixture was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The two sides turned on a thriller at Sunshine Coast Stadium in 2019 with two late tries to Cody Walker proving the difference.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-new-zealand-warriors-win-their-first-premiership>When did New Zealand Warriors win their first premiership?</h2>
<p>They re-branded themselves the New Zealand Warriors in 2001. The club has yet to win a premiership as of 2020, but has won one minor premiership (in 2002), reached two grand finals (2002, 2011), reached the play-offs eight times, and have never won the wooden spoon.</p>
