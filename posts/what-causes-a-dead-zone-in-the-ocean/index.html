<h2 id=what-causes-a-dead-zone-in-the-ocean>What causes a dead zone in the ocean?</h2>
<p>When there are excessive amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water, algae can bloom to harmful levels. Dead zones form when the algae die, sink to the bottom, and are decomposed by bacteria—a process that strips dissolved oxygen from the surrounding water.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-a-coastal-dead-zone-created>How is a coastal dead zone created?</h2>
<p>Dead zones begin to form when excess nutrients, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus, enter coastal waters and help fertilize blooms of algae. When these algae die and sink to the bottom, they provide a rich food source for bacteria, which in the act of decomposition consume dissolved oxygen from surrounding waters.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-dead-zone-off-the-gulf-coast-of-louisiana>What is the dead zone off the Gulf Coast of Louisiana?</h2>
<p>The hypoxic zone in the northern Gulf of Mexico is an area along the Louisiana-Texas coast, where water near the bottom of the Gulf contains less than two parts per million of dissolved oxygen, causing a condition referred to as hypoxia. Each summer, the size of the hypoxic zone is measured.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-gulf-of-mexico-dead-zone-form>How did the Gulf of Mexico dead zone form?</h2>
<p>A dead zone of oxygen-depleted waters forms every summer in the Gulf of Mexico in response to nutrient runoff from the Mississippi River watershed. Nutrient-rich runoff containing nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural lands and sewage causes the summer dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-dead-zones-are-there-in-the-ocean-2020>How many dead zones are there in the ocean 2020?</h2>
<p>Scientists have identified 415 dead zones worldwide.</p>

<h2 id=why-is-there-a-dead-zone-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-near-louisiana>Why is there a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico near Louisiana?</h2>
<p>As dead plant material falls from the surface through the water column deeper into the Gulf, bacteria consume it using oxygen. This lack of oxygen creates the Dead Zone in bottom waters on the Texas-Louisiana shelf throughout warm summer months.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-responsible-for-the-gulf-of-mexico-dead-zone>Who is responsible for the Gulf of Mexico dead zone?</h2>
<p>The primary culprit responsible for the growing size of the dead zone is an increasing supply of nitrogen dumped into the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River. Nitrogen levels discharged from the river have nearly tripled since the 1950s, with an annual average since 1980 of 1.6 million metric tons.</p>

<h2 id=why-are-there-dead-zones-in-the-gulf-of-mexico>Why are there dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico?</h2>
<p>“Dead zone” is a more common term for hypoxia, which refers to a reduced level of oxygen in the water. Hypoxic zones are areas in the ocean of such low oxygen concentration that animal life suffocates and dies, and as a result are sometimes called “dead zones.”. One of the largest dead zones forms in the Gulf of Mexico every spring.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-dead-zones-on-the-east-coast>Are there dead zones on the east coast?</h2>
<p>Dead zones occur in many areas of the country, particularly along the East Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes, but there is no part of the country or the world that is immune.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-dead-zones-in-the-great-lakes>Are there dead zones in the Great Lakes?</h2>
<p>The decomposition process consumes oxygen and depletes the supply available to healthy marine life. Dead zones occur in many areas of the country, particularly along the East Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes, but there is no part of the country or the world that is immune.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-be-in-a-dead-zone>What does it mean to be in a dead zone?</h2>
<p>“Dead zone” is a more common term for hypoxia, which refers to a reduced level of oxygen in the water. Habitats that would normally be teeming with life become, essentially, biological deserts. Hypoxic zones can occur naturally, but scientists are concerned about the areas created or enhanced by human activity.</p>
