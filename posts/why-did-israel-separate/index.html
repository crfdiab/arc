<h2 id=why-did-israel-separate>Why did Israel separate?</h2>
<p>As prophesied by Ahijah (1 Kings 11:31-35), the house of Israel was divided into two kingdoms. This division, which took place approximately 975 B.C., after the death of Solomon and during the reign of his son, Rehoboam, came about as the people revolted against heavy taxes levied by Solomon and Rehoboam.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-israel-divided-into-922-bc>Why did Israel divided into 922 BC?</h2>
<p>After Solomon’s death, in about 922 b. c., Israel divided into two kingdoms. To the south was Judah, which consisted of that tribe as well as Benjamin’s and part of the Levite priestly tribe. Ahab tried to align (associate) Israel with its neighbors, something God had clearly forbidden.</p>
<h2 id=how-and-why-was-israel-formed>How and why was Israel formed?</h2>
<p>Modern Israel has its origins in the Zionism movement, established in the late 19th century by Jews in the Russian Empire who called for the establishment of a territorial Jewish state after enduring persecution.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-israel-divided-into-the-southern-kingdom-and-northern-kingdom>Why was Israel divided into the southern kingdom and northern kingdom?</h2>
<p>Question: “Why was Israel divided into the Southern Kingdom and Northern Kingdom?” Answer: Throughout their history in the Promised Land, the children of Israel struggled with conflict among the tribes. The disunity went back all the way to the patriarch Jacob, who presided over a house divided.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-israel-divided-in-the-promised-land>Why was Israel divided in the Promised Land?</h2>
<p>Answer: Throughout their history in the Promised Land, the children of Israel struggled with conflict among the tribes. The disunity went back all the way to the patriarch Jacob, who presided over a house divided. The sons of Leah and the sons of Rachel had their share of contention even in Jacob’s lifetime (Genesis 37:1-11).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-people-of-ancient-israel-split>Why did the people of ancient Israel split?</h2>
<p>The king’s older advisers, who counselled his father, suggested he listen to the people and lighten their tax load. The younger advisers, who grew up with Rehoboam, took for granted the power of the tribes to become independent if they so wished.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-judah-become-the-headquarters-of-the-kingdom-of-israel>How did Judah become the headquarters of the Kingdom of Israel?</h2>
<p>Well, once Benjamin lost the kingdom to David, the tribe of Judah became the headquarters of the kingdom of Israel. Around the time when the kingdom was passed on to Solomon, a lot of contention began between the tribe. This was the time when Solomon began to fall out of favor with God for his behavior.</p>
