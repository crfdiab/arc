<h2 id=is-a-hurricane-likely-to-occur-in-maryland>Is a hurricane likely to occur in Maryland?</h2>
<p>The storm effects from hurricanes moving up the East Coast are felt in Maryland almost every year in the form of tropical storms, tropical depressions, or extratropical storms. High winds, heavy rains, and sometimes flash floods accompany these storms.</p>
<h2 id=what-parts-of-north-carolina-are-affected-by-hurricanes>What parts of North Carolina are affected by hurricanes?</h2>
<p>Since 1851, North Carolina has experienced upwards of 55 hurricanes, 7 of which ranked between categories 3 and 5. The most destructive hurricanes in North Carolina typically have landed in the months of September and October and most harshly affect the coast and Outer Banks.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-inland-is-safe-from-hurricanes-in-north-carolina>How far inland is safe from hurricanes in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Evacuate 50 to 200 miles inland, depending upon the hurricane and its predicted path, upon terrain and elevation, and the quality of your shelter. This will get you out of the worst winds and away from the immediate coastal storm surge.</p>
<h2 id=how-bad-are-hurricanes-in-north-carolina>How bad are hurricanes in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>But the state that may draw some confusion is North Carolina, which has been hit by 55 hurricanes since 1851, making it the third most hurricane-prone state in the U.S. and the most hurricane-prone state that doesn’t border the Gulf of Mexico. North Carolina: 55 hurricanes (7 were Category 3 through Category 5) 4.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-north-carolina-get-hit-by-hurricanes>How often does North Carolina get hit by hurricanes?</h2>
<p>about once every four years<br>
As to statistical hurricane research between 1883 and 1996 by the North Carolina State Climatology Office, a tropical cyclone makes landfall along the coastline about once every four years. An estimated 17.5 percent of all North Atlantic tropical cyclones have affected the state.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-inland-can-storm-surge-go>How far inland can storm surge go?</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, storm surges can push water tens of miles inland, causing flooding of 30 feet or more far from the coast.</p>
<h2 id=does-wilmington-nc-get-a-lot-of-hurricanes>Does Wilmington NC get a lot of hurricanes?</h2>
<p>Hurricane seasons are getting worse: Here’s what to expect in Wilmington this year. The Atlantic hurricane season and the Wilmington-area population are both growing into what could be a perfect storm. Forecasters expect 13-to-20 named storms this season, with between six and 10 becoming hurricanes.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hurricanes-have-hit-the-state-of-maryland>How many hurricanes have hit the state of Maryland?</h2>
<p>Hurricane Isabel, one of the most significant storms to affect the region, on September 18, 2003. Since 1950, 123 known hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions have affected the U.S. state of Maryland. Many of these storms also affect the country’s capital, Washington, D.C., since the city is located on territory ceded by Maryland.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-recent-hurricane-to-hit-north-carolina>What was the most recent hurricane to hit North Carolina?</h2>
<p>The first storm to impact the state during the period was Hurricane Florence in September 2000, and the most recent was Hurricane Florence in September 2018 with Hurricane Dorian in September 2019. In terms of windspeeds, Hurricane Isabel was the strongest storm to affect the state,…</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-tropical-storm-warning-for-maryland>What was the tropical storm warning for Maryland?</h2>
<p>Later that day, a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern Maryland coastline, which was upgraded to a tropical storm warning by about 24 hours before landfall. Officials recommended the citizens on Smith Island to evacuate on the day prior to the hurricane making landfall, the only evacuations for the Eastern shore of Maryland.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hurricane-sandy-make-landfall-in-maryland>When did Hurricane Sandy make landfall in Maryland?</h2>
<p>October 29, 2012 – Hurricane Sandy makes landfall north of the state. However, due to the tremendous size of the storm, its effects were felt all over Maryland. During the peak of the storm, 60 mph sustained winds were felt from Frederick, Maryland eastward.</p>
