<h2 id=is-ireland-still-divided-today>Is Ireland still divided today?</h2>
<p>Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. Geopolitically, Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), which covers five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id=is-ireland-more-catholic-or-protestant>Is Ireland more Catholic or Protestant?</h2>
<p>Ireland has two main religious groups. The majority of Irish are Roman Catholic, and a smaller number are Protestant (mostly Anglicans and Presbyterians). However, there is a majority of Protestants in the northern province of Ulster. More Catholics than Protestants emigrated to New Zealand.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-still-a-wall-in-belfast>Is there still a wall in Belfast?</h2>
<p>The majority of peace walls are located in Belfast, but they also exist in Derry, Portadown, and Lurgan, with more than 20 miles of walls in Northern Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-still-divisions-between-catholics-and-protestants>Are there still divisions between Catholics and Protestants?</h2>
<p>Five hundred years after the Reformation, there are still painful divisions between Protestants and Catholics. In Germany, the country of the Reformation, a deep animosity divided Catholic and Protestant Christians up until a few decades ago. This division had deepened over the centuries through religious conflicts and wars.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-conflict-between-catholics-and-protestants>What was the conflict between Catholics and Protestants?</h2>
<p>The scene of some truly ugly clashes between Catholics and Protestants. Often cited as evidence that Christianity inevitably causes division and bloodshed. But, it’s complicated. The period known as “the Troubles” began in 1968 and lasted for 30 years. On one side of the equation were the Unionists, also known as Loyalists – the Protestants.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-protestants-in-northern-ireland>Why are there so many Protestants in Northern Ireland?</h2>
<p>This is Belfast, Northern Ireland. The scene of some truly ugly clashes between Catholics and Protestants. Often cited as evidence that Christianity inevitably causes division and bloodshed. But, it’s complicated.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-peace-lines-between-catholic-and-protestant>Are there peace lines between Catholic and Protestant?</h2>
<p>However, security walls, euphemistically called “peace lines”, still separate key Catholic and Protestant neighbourhoods. Often, conflicts that we think of as religious, turn out to be, when we look more closely, about much more than just people’s spiritual beliefs.</p>
