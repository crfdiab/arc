<h2 id=what-force-is-responsible-for-erosion>What force is responsible for erosion?</h2>
<p>The three main forces that cause erosion are water, wind, and ice. Water is the main cause of erosion on Earth. Although water may not seem powerful at first, it is one of the most powerful forces on the planet.</p>
<h2 id=what-provides-the-energy-for-erosion>What provides the energy for erosion?</h2>
<p>The energy for erosion comes from five sources: gravity, the Sun, Earth’s rotation, chemical reactions, and organic activity. These forces work together to break down and carry away the surficial materials of Earth. All types of water movement in the ocean (waves and currents) erode and transport sediment.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-running-water-erosion>What causes running water erosion?</h2>
<p>Water flowing over Earth’s surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment, starting with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-main-forces-of-erosion>What are the 3 main forces of erosion?</h2>
<p>EROSION. Wind, water, and ice are the three agents of erosion, or the carrying away of rock, sediment, and soil. Erosion is distinguished from weathering — the physical or chemical breakdown of the minerals in rock.</p>
<h2 id=whats-a-simple-way-to-prevent-erosion>What’s a simple way to prevent erosion?</h2>
<p>How to Protect Eroded Land</p>
<ol>
<li>Mulch or compost can be used in tree and shrub beds or in areas where vegetation is difficult to grow.</li>
<li>Plants for erosion control.</li>
<li>Soil fertility or pH sometimes needs improvement to grow appropriate vegetation.</li>
<li>Mixing compost into the soil can also help soil fertility.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-is-the-effect-of-water-erosion>What is the effect of water erosion?</h2>
<p>Water erosion causes loss of topsoil, reduced crop yields, damaged infrastructure, weed dispersal, eutrophication (algal blooms) and silting of dams and natural waterways.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-three-examples-of-erosion>What are three examples of erosion?</h2>
<p>Examples of Erosion:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Caves. Caves are carved out over thousands of years by flowing water, but that activity can be sped up by carbonic acid present in the water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>River Banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cracks in Rocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gravitation Erosion.</p>

<h2 id=coastal-erosion-how-does-the-force-of-moving-water-cause-erosion>Coastal Erosion. How does the force of moving water cause erosion?</h2>
<p>When energy does work, the energy is transferred from one object to another. A river is always moving sediment from the mountains to the sea. At the same time, a river is also eroding its banks and valley. Gravity causes the movement of water across Earth’s land surface. But how does water cause erosion?</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-erosion-on-the-surface-of-the-earth>What causes erosion on the surface of the Earth?</h2>
<p>Erosion occurs when elements, such as water flow or wind remove small particles of soil or rock from the surface of the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-sheet-erosion-related-to-running-water>How is sheet erosion related to running water?</h2>
<p>When the rain is persistent, sheet erosion concentrates into tiny channels on the ground and the runoff changes into streams of flowing water. The effects of sheet erosion are not easily noticed in the short-term; however, a significant land degradation may be perceived years later.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-eroded-materials-transported-by-running-water>How are eroded materials transported by running water?</h2>
<p>After erosion, the eroded materials get transported with the running water. This transportation of eroded materials is carried in four ways: Traction: The heavier and larger rock fragments like gravels, pebbles etc are forced by the flow of the river to roll along its bed.</p>
