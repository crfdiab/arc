<h2 id=does-anyone-live-in-the-himeji-castle>Does anyone live in the Himeji Castle?</h2>
<p>Himeji Castle is said to be inhabited by the yōkai Osakabehime, who lives in the castle tower and avoids humans, whom she hates. In some legends she takes the form of an old woman (or woman in her 30s) in ceremonial, twelve-layered kimono.</p>

<p>Okiku<br>
The Himeji Castle Version In the Himeji version, Okiku was a servant of Aoyama, a retainer who planned a plot against his lord. Okiku overheard the plot and reported it to her lover, a loyal warrior. The plot was averted. When Aoyama found out that Okiku had been the cause for his failure, he decided to kill her.</p>

<h2 id=who-killed-okiku>Who killed Okiku?</h2>
<p>At first, Aoyama is convinced that Okiku broke the plate by accident and pardons her, but when Okiku reveals that she broke the plate on purpose in order to test his love, Aoyama is enraged and kills her. He then throws her body down a well.</p>
<h2 id=is-okiku-a-girl-or-boy>Is Okiku a girl or boy?</h2>
<p>Kiku has without a doubt presented himself as a female, but described himself as male. This is far from being a woman or a crossdresser or an okama, and in fact, comparing to the real world, until clarification, is simply called “Queer” or “Fluid”.</p>
<h2 id=is-okiku-an-otsuru>Is Okiku an Otsuru?</h2>
<p>Otsuru (大鶴 Ōtsuru) was once a young woman who lives under the pseudonym “Okiku” (お菊) given to her by the Empty 7 and a violent religious organization she was once an agent of. She later died by her contractor’s hands after meeting Afro later in adulthood.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-the-himeji-castle-in-japan>How old is the Himeji Castle in Japan?</h2>
<p>Himeji-jo, known also as Himeji Castle , is located in Himeji City, in Japan’s Hyogo Prefecture. A fort was originally built during the 14 th century AD on the present-day castle site, though the current structure dates to the 17 th century AD.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-himeji-castle-called-white-heron-castle>Why is Himeji Castle called White Heron Castle?</h2>
<p>Himeji Castle can be defined as a rare beauty. First, for its appearance: it is also called White Heron Castle for its white elegance, and it is considered one of Japan’s most spectacular castles because of its beauty and complex castle’s grounds.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-himeji-castle-survive-the-great-hanshin-earthquake>How did Himeji Castle survive the Great Hanshin earthquake?</h2>
<p>Amazingly the castle has survived not only the bombing of Himeji during World War II (it was seen as a key strategic location by the Americans) but also a major natural disaster, the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995. When building commenced on the hill in 1333, it was actually for a fort which wound up being demolished 13 years later.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-okiku-in-the-himeji-castle-story>Who was Okiku in the Himeji Castle story?</h2>
<p>There are several versions of the tale, and in the Himeji Castle one, Okiku is said to have been a servant of Aoyama, a retainer who was plotting against his lord. When Okiku overheard the plot, she reported it to her lover, a loyal retainer, thus foiling Aoyama’s plans.</p>
