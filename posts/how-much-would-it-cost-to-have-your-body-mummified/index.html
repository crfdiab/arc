<p>The mummification process could take up to 70 days to complete. Mummification was an expensive process and only the wealthy Egyptians could afford to have their bodies mummified after they died. Poor Egyptians were buried in the sand.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-mummified-body-called>What is a mummified body called?</h2>
<p>A mummy is a dead human or an animal whose soft tissues and organs have been preserved by either intentional or accidental exposure to chemicals, extreme cold, very low humidity, or lack of air, so that the recovered body does not decay further if kept in cool and dry conditions.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-people-who-could-not-afford-to-be-mummified>What happened to people who could not afford to be mummified?</h2>
<p>If they couldn’t pay for their preservation, their were buried in underground holes in the desert instead. The arid and hot weather worked to mummify them. Oddly enough, this practice was very effective, sometimes producing superior preservation results than the embalming of the upper class.</p>

<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-mummification>What do you need to know about mummification?</h2>
<p>Things to consider are the type of funeral service you would like, the Mummification process, the sarcophagus or casket, and the sanctuary or mausoleum.</p>
