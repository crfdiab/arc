<h2 id=how-does-literacy-affect-society>How does literacy affect society?</h2>
<p>The social impact Students who struggle with literacy feel ostracized from academia, avoid situations where they may be discovered or find themselves unable to fully participate in society or government. Says Dwyer, “Literacy permeates all areas of life, fundamentally shaping how we learn, work, and socialize.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-literacy-and-illiteracy-affect-our-lives>How does literacy and illiteracy affect our lives?</h2>
<p>Illiteracy affects all areas of life. Those with low literacy skills are far more likely to live in poverty, face health problems because they can’t read prescription labels or instructions, and grow isolated in a world increasingly dependent on computers.</p>
<h2 id=what-effect-does-illiteracy-have-on-a-country>What effect does illiteracy have on a country?</h2>
<p>The illiterate people trapped in a cycle of poverty with limited opportunities for employment or income generation and higher chances of poor health, turning to crime and dependence on social welfare. Therefore, illiteracy is a curse to humanity and socio-economic development.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-literacy-skills>What are literacy skills?</h2>
<p>Literacy is the ability to read, write, speak and listen in a way that lets us communicate effectively and make sense of the world.</p>
<h2 id=is-illiteracy-a-disability>Is illiteracy a disability?</h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, illiteracy is not a disability according to Social Security regulations. In other words, just because a person is unable to read or write, that does not necessarily mean they are incapable of working.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-literacy-rate-tell-us-about-a-country>What does literacy rate tell us about a country?</h2>
<p>Literacy rate is the amount of people in a country who can read and write. High rates of literacy are often found in developed of industrialized countries. Most of Europe has a high literacy rate. More industrialized countries are wealthier and can provide education, health care, and technology to its citizens.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-literacy-rate-related-to-population-growth>How is literacy rate related to population growth?</h2>
<p>It has been known that better education, partly reflected by higher literacy rates is associated with higher incomes and better health indicators such as lower infant mortality rates (IMRs) and lower population growth rate. Education of families, especially of women has a ‘multiplier effect’ on development.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-impact-of-literacy-on-the-economy>What is the impact of literacy on the economy?</h2>
<p>Literacy positively impacts economic growth beyond the local community. The impact of improving literacy in girls not only has a positive economic impact at a local and community level, but the productivity of the workforce flourishes at country level too by enhancing a country’s economic strength.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-low-literacy-levels-impact-on-the-community>How does low literacy levels impact on the community?</h2>
<p>In the World Literacy Foundation’s first two modules, I was startled by the real link between illiteracy (for people who are both completely and functionally illiterate) and their ability to succeed throughout life. Low literacy levels have a profound impact on communities worldwide and dictate what a person can or can’t do in everyday life.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-importance-of-literacy-so-important>Why is the importance of literacy so important?</h2>
<p>The importance of education, how literacy improves lives Literacy lifts individuals out of poverty Literacy improves the development of the wider community Literacy reduces infant mortality rates Literacy empowers women and girls Literacy positively impacts economic growth beyond the local community How you can help improve a young girl’s life</p>
