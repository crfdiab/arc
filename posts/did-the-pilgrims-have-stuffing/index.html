<h2 id=did-the-pilgrims-have-stuffing>Did the Pilgrims have stuffing?</h2>
<p>The Pilgrims instead stuffed birds with chunks of onion and herbs. “There is a wonderful stuffing for goose in the 17th-century that is just shelled chestnuts,” says Wall.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-actually-served-at-the-first-thanksgiving>What was actually served at the first Thanksgiving?</h2>
<p>There are only two surviving documents that reference the original Thanksgiving harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn bread and porridge.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-pilgrims-have-anything-to-do-with-thanksgiving>Did the Pilgrims have anything to do with Thanksgiving?</h2>
<p>The English colonists we call Pilgrims celebrated days of thanksgiving as part of their religion. But these were days of prayer, not days of feasting. Our national holiday really stems from the feast held in the autumn of 1621 by the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag to celebrate the colony’s first successful harvest.</p>
<h2 id=is-turkey-healthier-than-chicken>Is Turkey healthier than chicken?</h2>
<p>Turkey is fairly comparable to chicken in nutrients, but both its dark and white meat are slightly leaner. White meat has slightly less saturated fat than dark; skinless, boneless breast is leanest. Super-lean, lower in fat than other red meat. Look for loin cuts like tenderloin or top loin, which are typically leaner.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-pilgrims-not-eat-at-the-first-thanksgiving>What did the pilgrims not eat at the first Thanksgiving?</h2>
<p>Potatoes—white or sweet—would not have been featured on the 1621 table, and neither would sweet corn. Bread-based stuffing was also not made, though the Pilgrims may have used herbs or nuts to stuff birds.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-stuffing-become-a-staple-of-thanksgiving>When did stuffing become a staple of thanksgiving?</h2>
<p>As far as stuffing/dressing becoming a regular staple of the Thanksgiving Day meal, there are written records as far back as 1836. When the stuffing began leaving the actual insides of the animal being cooked is another question.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-thanksgiving-meal-take-place>Where did the first Thanksgiving meal take place?</h2>
<p>The holiday feast dates back to November 1621, when the newly arrived Pilgrims and the Wampanoag Indians gathered at Plymouth for an autumn harvest celebration, an event regarded as America’s “first Thanksgiving.”</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-indians-do-for-the-pilgrims>What did the Indians do for the pilgrims?</h2>
<p>The Indians also helped Pilgrims form an alliance with the Wampanoag tribe. After the first corn harvest proves a great success, the Pilgrims thanked the natives by throwing a huge party — now known as Thanksgiving.</p>
