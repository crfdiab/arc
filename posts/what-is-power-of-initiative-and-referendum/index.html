<h2 id=what-is-power-of-initiative-and-referendum>What is power of initiative and referendum?</h2>
<p>—The power of the people under a system of initiative and referendum to directly propose, enact, approve or reject, in whole or in part, the Constitution, laws, ordinances, or resolutions passed by any legislative body upon compliance with the requirements of this Act is hereby affirmed, recognized and guaranteed.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-requirements-for-peoples-initiative>What are the requirements for people’s initiative?</h2>
<p>Amendments to this Constitution may likewise be directly proposed by the people through initiative upon a petition of at least twelve per centum of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least three per centum of the registered votes therein.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-referendum-process-work-in-california>How does the referendum process work in California?</h2>
<p>Article II, Section 9, of the California Constitution provides for the referendum process in California. Electors have the power to approve or reject statutes or parts of statutes, with the exception of urgency statutes, statutes calling elections, and statutes providing for tax levies or appropriations for usual, current state expenses.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-initiative-process-work-in-california>How does the initiative process work in California?</h2>
<p>As originally instituted in California, there were two initiative processes available: the direct initiative and the indirect initiative. The direct initiative process allows voters to place a proposed statute or an amendment to the Constitution directly on the ballot. If a majority of the – 2 – voters approve the measure, it becomes law.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-california-start-the-citizens-initiative-process>When did California start the citizens initiative process?</h2>
<p>Just the FACTS. Californians are increasingly turning to the initiative process to make public policy. In 1911, California became the tenth state to enact the citizens’ initiative process. Today, 26 other states have an initiative or referendum process.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-we-need-an-initiative-or-referendum>When do we need an initiative or referendum?</h2>
<p>The initiative and referendum are intended to be available to the people when their elected representatives (i.e., the governor and Legislature) are unwilling or unable to adopt legislation. The initiative is a method of lawmaking that requires a vote of the people instead of a vote of the Legislature in order for a measure to become law.</p>
