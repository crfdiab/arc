<h2 id=where-does-the-gila-river-flow>Where does the Gila River flow?</h2>
<p>New Mexico<br>
Gila River, river rising in southwestern New Mexico, U.S., in the Elk Mountains, near the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument. The river, draining 58,100 sq mi (150,500 sq km), flows 630 mi (1,015 km) west and southwest over desert land to the Colorado River at Yuma, Ariz.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-gila-river-go-dry>Where does the Gila River go dry?</h2>
<p>Few people realize that the Gila is one of the longest rivers in the West. That’s because it’s typically drained dry before getting halfway through its 500-mile voyage west to the Colorado River near Yuma, AZ.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-gila-river-salty>Is the Gila River salty?</h2>
<p>Though, with as many people that enjoy the Arizona Salt River, very few actually understand why the fresh water of the Gila River, which turns into the Salt River Tributary, becomes salty to begin with once it leaves the White Mountains.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-gila-river-in-nm>How long is the Gila River in NM?</h2>
<p>1,044 km<br>
Gila River/Length</p>
<h2 id=why-do-they-call-it-salt-river>Why do they call it Salt River?</h2>
<p>The Salt’s headwaters tributaries, the Black River and East Fork, increase the river’s total length to about 300 miles (480 km). The name Salt River comes from the fact that the river flows over large salt deposits shortly after the merging of the White and Black Rivers.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-gila-river-run-year-round>Does the Gila River run year round?</h2>
<p>The Gila flows year-round due to return flows from agriculture just before joining the Colorado River near Yuma, having traveled 650 miles and descended nearly 9,000 feet in elevation from its headwaters.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-gila-river-used-for>What is the Gila River used for?</h2>
<p>Gila River is a New Mexico Treasure It flows through southern New Mexico and Arizona, supplying water for municipal, agricultural, and industrial needs – and supporting a diverse riparian ecosystem – before joining the Colorado River at Yuma, Arizona.</p>
<h2 id=what-tribe-is-the-gila-river>What tribe is the Gila River?</h2>
<p>The Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) traces its roots to the Hohokam, prehistoric Indians who lived and farmed along the Gila River Basin centuries ago. Composed of two members of tribes, the Pima and Maricopas, GRIC is located in south-central Arizona.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-gila-river-a-waterway-in-arizona>Is the Gila River a waterway in Arizona?</h2>
<p>The Gila River is a major waterway for Arizona, though flows (and especially navigable flows) are rare.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-watershed-of-the-gila-river>How big is the watershed of the Gila River?</h2>
<p>About 1,630 sq mi (4,200 km 2 ), or 2.8% of the Gila’s 58,200-square-mile (151,000 km 2) watershed, is in Mexico. A further 3,300 sq mi (8,500 km 2) or 5.7% lies within New Mexico, while the remaining majority, 53,270 sq mi (138,000 km 2) or 91.5%, is in Arizona.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-see-the-gila-river>Who was the first person to see the Gila River?</h2>
<p>The first European to see the Gila River was possibly Spanish explorer and missionary Juan de la Asunción. Asunción reached the Gila in 1538 after traveling northwards along one of its tributaries, either the San Pedro or Santa Cruz.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-europeans-settle-in-the-gila-river>When did the Europeans settle in the Gila River?</h2>
<p>Indigenous peoples have lived along the river for at least 2,000 years, establishing complex agricultural societies before European exploration of the region began in the 16th century. However, European Americans did not permanently settle the Gila River watershed until the mid-19th century.</p>
