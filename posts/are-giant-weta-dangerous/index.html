<h2 id=are-giant-weta-dangerous>Are Giant Weta dangerous?</h2>
<p>Although the Giant Weta is harmless to humans they are certainly not harmless to other animals. When male Giant Weta’s compete for mates they will use their enorumous pinchers to not just kill their rivals but to dismember them as well, apparently female Weta’s are impressed with such horrid demonstrations of violence.</p>
<h2 id=what-color-is-a-giant-weta>What color is a Giant Weta?</h2>
<p>Mahoenui giant wētā are unique amongst the giant wētā species in having two different colour morphs. Although most tend to be a dark brown mahogany colour, a third of them are a lovely yellow, and one female was even discovered with mahogany for half of her body and the other side yellow.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-find-a-giant-weta>Where can you find a giant Weta?</h2>
<p>New Zealand offshore<br>
They are found primarily on New Zealand offshore islands, having been almost exterminated on the mainland islands by introduced mammalian pests.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-largest-giant-weta>What is the largest Giant Weta?</h2>
<p>Little Barrier Island giant weta Deinacrida heteracantha<br>
The largest species of weta is the Little Barrier Island giant weta Deinacrida heteracantha, with a maximum recorded length of 11 cm (including the ovipositor in the female), and a legspan of over 17.5 cm (7 in).</p>
<h2 id=can-giant-weta-bite>Can Giant Weta bite?</h2>
<p>Wētā can bite with powerful mandibles. Tree wētā bites are painful but not particularly common. Tree wētā lift their hind legs in a defence displays to look large and spiky, but they tend to retreat if given the chance.</p>
<h2 id=can-the-giant-weta-jump>Can the Giant Weta jump?</h2>
<p>5. It can’t jump. Though it looks like a big cricket, giant weta are too heavy to fly. Some of its relatives, like the tree weta, are more agile and can jump, but giant weta are decidedly earth-bound.</p>
<h2 id=do-weta-bites-hurt>Do WETA bites hurt?</h2>
<p>Wētā can bite with powerful mandibles. Tree wētā bites are painful but not particularly common. The female wētā looks as if she has a stinger, but it is an ovipositor, which enables her to lay eggs inside rotting or mossy wood or soil.</p>
<h2 id=can-wetas-fly>Can Wetas fly?</h2>
<p>Though it looks like a big cricket, giant weta are too heavy to fly. Some of its relatives, like the tree weta, are more agile and can jump, but giant weta are decidedly earth-bound.</p>
<h2 id=what-eats-giant-weta>What eats giant Weta?</h2>
<p>Predation: Wētā have evolved alongside native predators such as birds, reptiles, and bats. The introduction of predators such as rats, mustelids, cats, and hedgehogs has resulted in a sharp increase in the rate of predation.</p>
<h2 id=do-weta-bites-hurt-1>Do weta bites hurt?</h2>
<h2 id=do-wetas-jump>Do Wetas jump?</h2>
<p>Wetas can run very quickly and jump great distances. They are seldom seen in daylight but feed at night, mainly on plants.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-wetas-live-for>How long do Wetas live for?</h2>
<p>about 6-9 months<br>
Adult wētāpunga only live for about 6-9 months, during which time they will mate repeatedly. The females lay many groups of eggs in soft soil on the forest floor.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-does-a-giant-weta-get-in-size>How big does a giant weta get in size?</h2>
<p>There are eleven species of giant weta, most of which are larger than other wētā, despite the latter also being large by insect standards. Large species can be up to 10 cm (4 in), not inclusive of legs and antennae, with body mass usually no more than 35 g (1.2 oz). One gravid captive female reached a mass of about 70 g (2.47 oz),…</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-giant-weta-get-its-name>How did the giant weta get its name?</h2>
<p>Its name means “god of ugly things.” The name weta comes from the Maori word wetapunga, or “ god of ugly things ” [ PDF ]. The genus name, deinacrida, means “ terrible grasshopper .” 3. It loves carrots. In 2011, Smithsonian researcher Mark Moffett stumbled upon a particularly large giant weta on a trip to New Zealand’s Little Barrier Island.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-does-a-giant-weta-eat>What kind of food does a giant weta eat?</h2>
<p>Visitors need a permit from the DOC before visiting the island. The giant weta is usually less social and more passive than other weta species. Their genus name, Deinacrida, is Greek for “fierce grasshopper”. Its diet consists of plants (even carrot!), other small insects and fruit.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-giant-weta-left-in-new-zealand>Are there any giant weta left in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Most populations of giant wētā have been in decline since humans began modifying the New Zealand environment. All but one giant wētā species is protected by law because they are considered at risk of extinction.</p>
