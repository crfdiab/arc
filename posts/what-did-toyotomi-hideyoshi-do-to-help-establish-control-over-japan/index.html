<h2 id=what-did-toyotomi-hideyoshi-do-to-help-establish-control-over-japan>What did Toyotomi Hideyoshi do to help establish control over Japan?</h2>
<p>After Toyotomi Hideyoshi succeeded in unifying Japan in the late sixteenth century, he took tight control of the state, introducing new taxation, establishing a class system, and sending large armies on military campaigns to Korea.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-hideyoshi-do-to-consolidate-his-control-of-japan>What did Hideyoshi do to consolidate his control of Japan?</h2>
<p>In 1583 Hideyoshi was in a very strong position. He summoned the powerful daimyos to Kiyosu so that they could determine Nobunaga’s heir. Hideyoshi had thus consolidated his own power, dealt with most of the Oda clan, and controlled 30 provinces.</p>
<h2 id=did-toyotomi-hideyoshi-conquer-most-of-japan>Did Toyotomi Hideyoshi conquer most of Japan?</h2>
<p>Upon conquering the whole of Japan, Hideyoshi entrusted the position of kampaku to his nephew, Toyotomi Hidetsugu, henceforth assuming the title of taikō, the designation of a retired kampaku. He then prepared to invade Korea.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-oda-nobunaga-and-toyotomi-hideyoshi-unify-japan>How did Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi unify Japan?</h2>
<p>After waging successful campaigns in the name of his lord, Hideyoshi successfully avenged Nobunaga’s death and quickly set about taking his place at the top of the samurai order. Through military and political means, he finished the task of unifying Japan by 1590, establishing his headquarters in Osaka.</p>
<h2 id=was-hideyoshi-a-good-man>Was Hideyoshi a good man?</h2>
<p>Enter Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a man whose leadership skills and authoritative prowess helped him rise to become one of Nobunaga’s three right-hand men. After Nobunaga and his oldest son were assassinated in 1582, Hideyoshi avenged their deaths in the Battle of Yamazaki and made peace with a rival clan.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-toyotomi-hideyoshi-and-what-did-he-do>Who was Toyotomi Hideyoshi and what did he do?</h2>
<p>Another of his followers, who would go down in history as Toyotomi Hideyoshi, in turn defeated Mitsuhide in battle, and ultimately completed Nobunaga’s task. Hashiba Hideyoshi, as he was first known, is said to have been the son of an ashigaru, or foot soldier. He was born in Nobunaga’s province of Owari (now Aichi Prefecture) in 1537.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hideyoshi-hideyoshi-become-lord-of-nagahama>When did Hideyoshi Hideyoshi become Lord of Nagahama?</h2>
<p>When Nobunaga began his campaign to subjugate central Japan in 1568, Hideyoshi fought in many of the important battles. In September 1573, by overthrowing two powerful daimyo, Hideyoshi became a lord of Nagahama, Ōmi province, and subsequently took the name of Hashiba Chikuzen no kami (Hashiba, Lord of Chikuzen).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-toyotomi-hideyoshi-make-peace-with-the-mori-clan>When did Toyotomi Hideyoshi make peace with the Mori clan?</h2>
<p>After the assassinations at Honnō-ji of Oda Nobunaga and his eldest son Nobutada in 1582 at the hands of Akechi Mitsuhide, Hideyoshi, seeking vengeance for the death of his beloved lord, made peace with the Mōri clan and defeated Akechi at the Battle of Yamazaki. Subsequently, Hideyoshi was in a very strong position.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-hideyoshi-important-to-the-battle-of-inabayama>Why was Hideyoshi important to the Battle of Inabayama?</h2>
<p>Nobunaga’s easy victory at the siege of Inabayama Castle in 1567 was largely due to Hideyoshi’s efforts, and despite his peasant origins, in 1568 Hideyoshi became one of Nobunaga’s most distinguished generals, eventually taking the name Hashiba Hideyoshi (羽柴 秀吉).</p>
