<p>The “Aurora Australis” was found in 1938 at Lightning Ridge and is considered the world’s most valuable black opal. The rarity of the opal comes from its size and strong, vibrant colour play. It weighs 180 carats and its dimensions are 3 inches x 1.8 inches.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-opal-in-coober-pedy>Why is there opal in Coober Pedy?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-the-rarest-color-to-flash-through-an-opal>What is the rarest color to flash through an opal?</h2>
<p>Black opal is the most rare and highly valued form of opal, and has what is called a black (or dark) body tone. Black opals come in every colour of the rainbow.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-black-opal-so-expensive>Why is Black opal so expensive?</h2>
<p>Black opals are so expensive because they’re so hard to find. The gems are formed when a solution of silicone dioxide and water evaporates from the cracks of sandstone and the darker the body tone, the more desirable a black opal. This composition means they’re more delicate than diamonds.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-opals-are-from-coober-pedy>What kind of opals are from Coober Pedy?</h2>

<p>Licensed under CC By-SA 2.5. Australia produces roughly 95% of the world’s precious opal, including black opal. This most valuable variety is found at Lightning Ridge, the largest producer of opal by value. However, the town of Coober Pedy is the largest producer by mass.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-miners-in-coober-pedy>What was life like for miners in Coober Pedy?</h2>
<p>Coober Pedy used to just be a town just for miners, who would burrow into the hill and live there by themselves on little cots while out mining, and have a family elsewhere. They would essentially live within their mine shaft, in a separate living area.</p>
