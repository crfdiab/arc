<p>The end of the war Many German civilians were starving and there were severe food shortages. Sailors at Kiel and Wilhelmshaven had mutinied after being ordered to take part in one final offensive against the British navy.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-german-soldiers-treated-after-ww1>How were German soldiers treated after ww1?</h2>
<p>After WWI, German psychiatrists diagnosed traumatized soldiers as having “hysteria,” othering the men to somewhat disastrous effect. Instead, writes historian Paul Lerner, men who came back from the war with psychological trauma were dubbed hysterical—with disastrous consequences.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-world-war-1-affect-germany>How did World War 1 affect Germany?</h2>
<p>After the Treaty of Versailles called for punishing reparations, economic collapse and another world war thwarted Germany’s ability to pay. Germany had been forced to become a republic instead of a monarchy, and its citizens were humiliated by their nation’s bitter loss.</p>

<h2 id=who-ran-germany-after-ww1>Who ran Germany after ww1?</h2>
<p>Hitler<br>
After a brief struggle for power, Hitler was named Chancellor in January 1933. Within weeks, he invoked Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution to quash many civil rights and suppress members of the Communist party.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-german-pows-in-ww1>What happened to German POWS in ww1?</h2>
<p>Prisoner exchanges, internment in neutral countries, and repatriation. In all, 219,000 prisoners were exchanged. During the war, some prisoners were sent to neutral Switzerland on grounds of ill health. Internment conditions were very strict in Switzerland but softened with time.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-germany-during-world-war-1>What was life like in Germany during World War 1?</h2>
<p>For most Germans, life during the early stages of the war was reasonably comfortable. Germany was blockaded by Britain so there were some shortages, especially of oil, rare metals, and to some foodstuffs. General building materials had been diverted to war purposes and were also hard to get.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-germany-like-right-after-world-war-2>What was Germany like right after World War 2?</h2>
<p>The early seeds of the Cold War were sewn in the post-WWII tension over Germany; both sides were unwilling to open fire, but Berlin and Germany became cards to be played by the larger world powers.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-reconstruction-of-germany-after-world-war-2>What was the reconstruction of Germany after World War 2?</h2>
<p>The reconstruction of Germany after World War II was a long process after Hitler’s suicide, which had ended the war. Germany had suffered heavy losses during the war, both in lives and industrial power. 6.9 to 7.5 million Germans had been killed, roughly 8.26 to 8.86% of the population (see also World War II casualties ).</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-unrest-in-germany-during-world-war-1>Why was there unrest in Germany during World War 1?</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, there was also significant unrest at home. It had become clear to the German people that losing was inevitable. They were disillusioned with the politics and harsh conditions of war, and many lent their support to the extremist parties which had emerged all over Germany.</p>
