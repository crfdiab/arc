<h2 id=do-more-developed-countries-have-higher-growth-rates>Do more developed countries have higher growth rates?</h2>
<p>GDP growth rates in developing countries are on average higher than those in developed countries. Over the 1965-99 period, the average annual growth rate was 4.1 percent in low-income countries, 4.2 percent in middle-income countries, and 3.2 percent in high-income countries (see Figure 4.1).</p>
<h2 id=which-developed-country-has-the-highest-growth-rate>Which developed country has the highest growth rate?</h2>
<p>Also in the top 20 nations with the highest growth of the GDP is China. In 2016, the GDP in China was the second highest GDP in the world. It is estimated that by 2019 the GDP in China will grow by 6 percent….</p>

<h2 id=which-country-has-the-highest-growth-rate-and-why>Which country has the highest growth rate and why?</h2>
<p>In Syria, the population grew by about 5.32 percent compared to the previous year, making it the country with the highest population growth rate in 2021. Today, the global population amounts to around 7 billion people, i.e. the total number of living humans on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=why-developed-countries-have-less-gdp-growth>Why developed countries have less GDP growth?</h2>
<p>A significant increase in the GDP of an advanced economy would register as a relatively low GDP growth only because of the initial large size of the economy. Also, developed countries grow mainly through innovation as they are already at the leading edge of technology, finance, etc.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-normal-growth-rate-for-a-country>What is a normal growth rate for a country?</h2>
<p>A Healthy Rate of Growth Is 2% to 3%</p>
<h2 id=is-japan-a-developed-country>Is Japan a developed country?</h2>
<p>Japan is one of the largest and most developed economies in the world. It has a well-educated, industrious workforce and its large, affluent population makes it one of the world’s biggest consumer markets.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-reasons-for-population-growth-in-developing-countries>What are the reasons for population growth in developing countries?</h2>
<p>In some countries the lack of education for females is enforced due to old traditions or fear of educated women. In other countries the resources are not available. Information about birth control has not reached some of the most remote places – mostly in Africa.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-rich-countries-grow-faster-than-poor-countries>Why did rich countries grow faster than poor countries?</h2>
<p>One puzzle of the world economy is that for 200 years, the world’s rich countries grew faster than poorer countries, a process aptly described by Lant Pritchett as “Divergence, Big Time.”</p>
<h2 id=why-are-some-countries-developing-faster-than-others>Why are some countries developing faster than others?</h2>
<p>Spotting this reversal, the Nobel laureate economist Michael Spence has argued that the world is poised for The Next Convergence. Yet some countries are still diverging. While the Netherlands was 5.8, 7.7, and 15 times richer than Nicaragua, Côte D’Ivoire, and Kenya, respectively, in 1980, by 2012 it was 10.5, 21.1, and 24.4 times richer.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-different-rates-of-economic-growth-in-different-countries>Why are there different rates of economic growth in different countries?</h2>
<p>Globalisation and multinationals. The world is increasingly globalised; big multinationals have operations in all major economies. If they improve their productivity and invest, it tends to be felt on a global scale, not just in a particular country. Global shocks. All major economies are subject to the same global shocks.</p>
