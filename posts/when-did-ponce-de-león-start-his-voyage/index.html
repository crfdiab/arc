<h2 id=how-long-was-ponce-de-leóns-voyage>How long was Ponce de León’s voyage?</h2>
<p>His vessels left Puerto Rico on March 3, 1513, and reached the east coast of Florida (which received the name from his landfall on the Easter holiday of “Pascua Florida”) on April 2, 1513. For six weeks he skirted the coastline southward past Cape Canaveral, Palm Beach, and Biscayne Bay to the Keys and Tortugas.</p>

<p>The plan was to set up a farming colony. As they went inland for fresh water, the Calusa ambushed them. Ponce de León was shot in the thigh by an arrow and was seriously wounded. As a result of his wound, Ponce de León died at the age of 61 in Cuba.</p>
