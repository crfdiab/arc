<h2 id=what-will-happen-if-there-is-too-much-trash>What will happen if there is too much trash?</h2>
<p>Overflowing waste causes air pollution and respiratory diseases. One of the outcomes of overflowing garbage is air pollution, which causes various respiratory diseases and other adverse health effects as contaminants are absorbed from lungs into other parts of the body.</p>
<h2 id=what-will-happen-to-our-earth-if-we-keep-throwing-out-so-much-rubbish>What will happen to our earth if we keep throwing out so much rubbish?</h2>
<p>The more emissions that we produce due to how much trash we generate, affects us long term. One can develop diseases such as asthma, birth defects, cancer, cardiovascular disease, childhood cancer, COPD, infectious diseases, low birth weight, and preterm delivery.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-too-much-trash-a-problem>Why is too much trash a problem?</h2>
<p>Trash can travel throughout the world’s rivers and oceans, accumulating on beaches and within gyres. This debris harms physical habitats, transports chemical pollutants, threatens aquatic life, and interferes with human uses of river, marine and coastal environments.</p>
<h2 id=do-we-have-a-trash-problem>Do we have a trash problem?</h2>
<p>Humans generate a remarkable amount of garbage: over 2 billion tonnes per year, according to the World Bank, or approximately 4.5 trillion pounds annually. And that figure is going to grow. Global garbage is expected to reach 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050.</p>
<h2 id=how-bad-is-our-trash-problem>How bad is our trash problem?</h2>
<p>According to the EPA, Americans generate over 250 millions tons of trash each year. Right now, most of that trash doesn’t get recycled or composted. Instead, it ends up in landfills and incinerators, polluting the communities that house these facilities and exacerbating our climate crisis.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-worlds-trash-problem>How big is the world’s trash problem?</h2>
<p>Humans generated 2.01 billion tons of solid waste in 2016 and by 2050, that could rise to 3.4 billion tons, according to the World Bank. About 12% of all municipal waste in 2016 was plastic ⁠— 242 million tons of it.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-amount-of-trash-affect-the-environment>How does the amount of trash affect the environment?</h2>
<p>The more emissions that we produce due to how much trash we generate, affects us long term. One can develop diseases such as asthma, birth defects, cancer, cardiovascular disease, childhood cancer, COPD, infectious diseases, low birth weight, and preterm delivery. Bacteria, vermin and insects can also be added to the problem that trash causes.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-garbage-does-the-world-produce-per-day>How much garbage does the world produce per day?</h2>
<p>Not in terms of artificial human life, but in terms of our trash production. A World Bank report projects that the amount of solid waste we generate on earth will double by the year 2025. If current trends continue, we are likely to go from 3.5 million tons to 6 million tons per day by that point.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-people-dealing-with-too-much-trash>How are people dealing with too much trash?</h2>
<p>So as landfills keep filling up, people will have to find more places for all that trash. Too much trash has always been a problem for communities of people. Early American settlers dealt with their garbage by dumping it over their back fence, in the river or burying it in their yard. They often burned garbage too.</p>
