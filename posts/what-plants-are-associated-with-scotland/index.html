<h2 id=what-kind-of-plants-are-found-in-scotland>What kind of plants are found in Scotland?</h2>
<p>Bluebells, primroses and twinflower are just some of the beautiful plants found in Scotland’s woodlands. Some of our vascular plant ‘spectaculars’ are restricted to our part of the world. Bluebells are at their most impressive in Britain, and Scotland’s most famous vascular plant show is the August purple of our heather moors.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-species-of-trees-are-native-to-scotland>How many species of trees are native to Scotland?</h2>
<p>Over-grazing caused by the large numbers of Red Deer and sheep has also resulted in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats and a loss of native woodland. Only thirty-one species of deciduous tree and shrub are native to Scotland, including 10 willows, four whitebeams and three birch and cherry species.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-trees-are-in-the-caledonian-forest>What kind of trees are in the Caledonian Forest?</h2>
<p>The Caledonian Forest is a rich tapestry which includes over 30 different types of trees. Your tree, will be a sapling grown from locally collected seed and will be one of a number of species we plant such as alder, aspen, birch, bird cherry, hazel, holly, rowan, Scots pine or willow. Can I choose my tree?</p>
<h2 id=how-are-trees-for-life-helping-the-scottish-highlands>How are trees for life helping the Scottish Highlands?</h2>
<p>Trees for Life will plant trees in the Scottish Highlands on your behalf. Your trees will be planted alongside other native trees, and in time will transform open hillsides into healthy young woodland, helping to restore the Caledonian Forest.</p>
