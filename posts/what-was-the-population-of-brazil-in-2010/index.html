<h2 id=how-many-people-live-in-major-cities-in-brazil>How many people live in major cities in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Since then, the urban population has continued to grow to almost 80% of the country’s population—with 185 million people living in major metropolitan areas. Brazil has 17 cities with over a million residents, with seven of these having more than 2 million residents.</p>
<p>The country is also expected to begin aging rapidly as the median age rises from around 32 years old to around 44 years old in 2050. This increase in the aging population will start to tax Brazil’s social programs and affect the country’s economy as it loses more and more of its working population.</p>
