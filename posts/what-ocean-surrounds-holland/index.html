<h2 id=what-ocean-surrounds-holland>What ocean surrounds Holland?</h2>
<p>the North Sea<br>
The Netherlands is bounded by the North Sea to the north and west, Germany to the east, and Belgium to the south. If the Netherlands were to lose the protection of its dunes and dikes, the most densely populated part of the country would be inundated (largely by the sea but also in part by the rivers).</p>
<h2 id=is-holland-surrounded-by-water>Is Holland surrounded by water?</h2>
<p>The Netherlands famously is not just fronted by water but permeated by it – a fifth of the total surface area consists of water. As a result, Dutch topography is among the most unique in the world: acres of flat grassland, turning windmills, hunchbacked dikes, and barely a hill in sight.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-sea-level-of-the-netherlands>What is the sea level of the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>Well, yes. About one third of the Netherlands lies below sea level, with the lowest point being 22 feet (6.7 meters) below sea level. Meanwhile, the highest point is about a thousand feet above sea level. That gives you an idea of what the landscape of the Netherlands looks like.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-terrain-of-netherlands>What is the terrain of Netherlands?</h2>
<p>The Netherlands is situated in Northwest Europe,reclaimed in part from the waters of the North Sea, The Netherlands is an artificially created land, half of which lies at or below sea level. The country possesses a flat terrain compromising mostly of coastal lowland, farmland, grassy dunes, and sandy beaches.</p>

<p>Here are some well-known, traditional Dutch dishes:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id=huzarensalade-where-are-the-north-sea-islands-in-holland>Huzarensalade. Where are the North Sea Islands in Holland?</h2>
<p>In the north of the Netherlands, the North Sea islands of Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog are lined up like pearls in a necklace. Many holidaymakers come to Holland’s North Sea coast because of the fantastic beaches and seaside resorts.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-netherlands-located-in-the-world>Where is the Netherlands located in the world?</h2>
<p>Located in northern Europe, just northeast of Belgium and west of Germany, the Netherlands contains 280 miles (451 km) of coastline along the North Sea. The Netherlands also contains the mouths of three important European rivers: the Rhine, Schelde, and Meuse.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-netherlands-compared-to-the-north-sea>How big is the Netherlands compared to the North Sea?</h2>
<p>The Netherlands, which is roughly the size of the U.S. states Connecticut and Massachusetts combined, has an average elevation of 36 feet (11 meters). A huge part of the Netherlands is highly susceptible to flooding. Time will tell if the North Sea Protection Works are strong enough to protect it.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-name-holland-come-from-in-the-netherlands>Where does the name Holland come from in the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>(May 2018) Holland is a region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands.

This usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and sometimes employed by the Dutch themselves.</p>
