Officially titled “An Act to set apart a certain Tract of Land lying near the Head-waters of the Yellowstone River as a public Park,” this landmark legislation created the first national park.</p>
<h2 id=what-president-made-yellowstone-a-national-park>What president made Yellowstone a national park?</h2>
<p>Yellowstone was born on March 1, 1872 — making it the world’s first national park. When President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act into law, it protected more than 2 million acres of mountain wilderness, amazing geysers and vibrant landscapes for future generations to enjoy.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-theodore-roosevelt-want-national-parks>Why did Theodore Roosevelt want national parks?</h2>
<p>Roosevelt created the present-day USFS in 1905, an organization within the Department of Agriculture. The idea was to conserve forests for continued use. An adamant proponent of utilizing the country’s resources, Roosevelt wanted to insure the sustainability of those resources.</p>

<h2 id=who-is-the-director-of-the-national-park-service>Who is the director of the National Park Service?</h2>
<p>The National Park Service is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The director is nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

<h2 id=who-was-president-when-zion-national-park-was-established>Who was president when Zion National Park was established?</h2>
