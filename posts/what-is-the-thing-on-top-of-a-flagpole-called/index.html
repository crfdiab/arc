<h2 id=what-is-the-thing-on-top-of-a-flagpole-called>What is the thing on top of a flagpole called?</h2>
<p>At the top sits a little golden sphere known as the finial ball. Inside is a razor blade, a match, and a bullet. You must use the razor blade to cut the stars and stripes from the American flag, the match to burn the remains, and the bullet to defend the base or shoot yourself … depending on the circumstance.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-ball-on-top-of-a-flagpole-for>What is the ball on top of a flagpole for?</h2>
<p>The Legend on Top of Military Flagpoles In order to protect the sacred Starts & Stripes from falling into the wrong hands, a brave soldier must use the items hidden inside the gold ball on top of the flagpole to defend Old Glory to the death, or provide her with a proper burial.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-top-of-a-flagpole-work>How does the top of a flagpole work?</h2>
<p>Instead of a halyard, the pole uses a cable assembly with counterweights and retainer rings on it. To raise or lower a flag, a person would attach the flag to the hooks and simply pull the rope until the flag reached the desired height. He would then tie the excess rope onto the pole’s cleats.</p>
<h2 id=what-direction-should-a-flagpole-face>What direction should a flagpole face?</h2>
<p>When the U.S. flag is displayed other than from a staff, it should be displayed flat, or suspended so that its folds fall free. When displayed over a street, place the union so it faces north or east, depending upon the direction of the street.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-cleat-go-on-a-flagpole>Where does the cleat go on a flagpole?</h2>
<p>A cleat is used at the bottom of your flagpole to secure the halyard, or rope, and keep your flag flying high. Cleats are available in several sizes and metals. We recommend using aluminum cleats on aluminum flagpoles.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-placed-at-the-foot-of-the-flagpole-animal-farm>What was placed at the foot of the flagpole Animal Farm?</h2>
<p>The flagpole is the physical representation of the animals efforts and their symbolic accomplishment. The gun at the bottom of the flagpole is also symbolic. It is a reminder that the revolution could not have been accomplished without bloodshed and violence.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-stars-and-stripes-important-to-the-us-flag>Why are the Stars and Stripes important to the US flag?</h2>
<p>It is America’s strength in honor, as dignified in the stars and stripes of the flag, which helps to establish the moral character of our national foundation. The flag, endearingly referred to as “Old Glory,” represents all people of America.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-do-with-their-money-during-the-dust-bowl>What did people do with their money during the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>Livestock healthy enough to be butchered could fetch as much as $16 a head, with the meat used to feed homeless people living in Hoovervilles. The Soil Conservation Service, established in 1935, paid farmers to leave fields idle, employ land management techniques such as crop rotation and replant native prairie grasses.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-gold-eagle-on-the-us-flag-stand-for>What does the gold eagle on the US flag stand for?</h2>
<p>The adornments (FINIAL) on the top of the flag pole are for military use only. The gold eagle is for the use of the President of the United States only, and only in time of war. The gold eagle is for the use of the President of the United States only, and only in time of war.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-flag-of-the-united-states-look-like>What does the flag of the United States look like?</h2>
<p>The American Flag of Peace of the united States of America is described as red, white and blue, with thirteen alternating red and white horizontal stripes, and a blue field (union) with 50 stars, one to represent each of the several States.</p>
