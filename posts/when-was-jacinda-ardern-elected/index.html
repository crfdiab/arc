<h2 id=when-was-jacinda-ardern-elected>When was Jacinda Ardern elected?</h2>
<p>Ardern was first elected as an MP in the 2008 general election, when Labour lost power after nine years….Jacinda Ardern.</p>
<table><tr><th>The Right Honourable Jacinda Ardern MP</th></tr><tr><td>Assumed office 26 October 2017</td></tr><tr><td>Monarch</td><td>Elizabeth II</td></tr><tr><td>Governor-General</td><td>Patsy Reddy</td></tr><tr><td>Deputy</td><td>Winston Peters (2017–2020) Grant Robertson (2020–present)</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=does-new-zealand-have-a-westminster-system>Does New Zealand have a Westminster system?</h2>
<p>The New Zealand Parliamentary system follows the Westminster system (a parliamentary system of government modelled after the politics of the United Kingdom). It has three branches designed to ensure that no part of the system has ultimate power and that there are checks and balances on each.</p>
<h2 id=does-new-zealand-have-dogs>Does New Zealand have dogs?</h2>
<p>New Zealand is known for being one of the most pet-friendly countries in the world, with a large number of pet parents and pets. While New Zealand welcomes dogs and cats of different breeds in the country, provided all import regulations are met, it has breed restrictions on certain dangerous breeds.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-this-parliament-unique-in-nz-history>Why is this parliament unique in NZ history?</h2>
<p>The New Zealand Parliament was established in 1854 and is one of the oldest continuously functioning legislatures in the world. It has met in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, since 1865. Māori were represented in Parliament from 1867, and in 1893 women gained the vote.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-know-who-is-in-parliament-in-new-zealand>Do you know who is in Parliament in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>The general election is just around the corner, but many New Zealanders understand very little about the basics of who they are voting for and how they can get them elected. A third of New Zealanders don’t know which political parties are in Parliament, and less than half know how a party can get into power under MMP, a new report shows.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-maori-get-their-seats-in-parliament>When did Maori get their seats in Parliament?</h2>
<p>Reserved Māori seats were created in 1867 during the term of the 4th Parliament; Māori men aged 21 and over, whether or not they owned property, could vote to elect four Māori members of the House of Representatives. The Māori electorates have lasted far longer than the intended five years.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-political-parties-in-new-zealand>Are there any political parties in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>A third of New Zealanders don’t know which political parties are in Parliament, and less than half know how a party can get into power under MMP, a new report shows. In some ways, that knowledge gap may not seem to matter.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-prime-minister-of-new-zealand-in-1999>Who was the Prime Minister of New Zealand in 1999?</h2>
<p>Helen Clark became Prime Minister when her Labour Party won the 1999 election with 39% of the vote. Since being elected in 1981, she had held a number of portfolios, including Conservation, Housing, and Health.</p>
