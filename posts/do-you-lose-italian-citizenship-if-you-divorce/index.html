<h2 id=do-you-lose-italian-citizenship-if-you-divorce>Do you lose Italian citizenship if you divorce?</h2>
<p>A. The law requires that the couple remains married until the conclusion of the process in order for the citizenship application to be approved. If the couple gets divorced during the process, the citizenship application cannot be completed and citizenship will not be granted to the non-Italian spouse.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-lose-citizenship-if-i-divorce>Do I lose citizenship if I divorce?</h2>
<p>Divorce Makes Applicants Ineligible to Apply for Citizenship in Three Rather Than Five Years. You have to remain married up until you actually get your citizenship, and you have to be living with your spouse three years before filing your citizenship application to qualify for early citizenship.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-lose-your-italian-citizenship>Do you lose your Italian citizenship?</h2>
<p>LOSS OF CITIZENSHIP Italian citizens can lose citizenship automatically or formally renouncing it.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-get-italian-citizenship-back-after-renouncing>Can you get Italian citizenship back after renouncing?</h2>
<p>Individuals who renounced their Italian citizenship can get it back automatically after a full year of uninterrupted residency in Italy.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-lose-my-permanent-resident-status-if-i-divorce>Can I lose my permanent resident status if I divorce?</h2>
<p>A divorce may make it harder to become a permanent resident, but it is still possible. If you already have a green card and are a permanent resident at the time of the divorce, the divorce should not change your status. However, the divorce may force you to wait longer to apply for naturalization.</p>
<h2 id=what-documents-are-needed-for-italian-citizenship>What documents are needed for Italian citizenship?</h2>
<p>Documents needed to become Italian citizens</p>
<ul>
<li>A photocopy of ID, passport, residence permit/certificate of stay and of the Italian identity card.</li>
<li>A photocopy of the birth certificate, complete with all general information (translated and legalized or apostilled) provided by the authorities of the country of origin.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-much-does-divorce-cost-in-italy>How much does divorce cost in Italy?</h2>
<p>An estimate of cost, including attorneys, would be between 2 and 3 million lire. The judicial divorce takes longer, depending upon the how many and what kind of questions need to be resolved by the court. No cost estimate is available for this, since it depends on the questions and issues involved.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-if-you-lose-your-italian-citizenship>What to do if you lose your Italian citizenship?</h2>
<p>If you have lost your Italian citizenship as a result of becoming a citizen of another country (before August 16th 1992) you may now regain it in two different modalities: By signing a declaration of regain and having settled or settling, within a year from the declaration, your residency in Italy;</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-become-an-italian-citizen-after-marriage>When do you become an Italian citizen after marriage?</h2>
<p>Italian Citizenship through Marriage — documents you need. If you are married to an Italian citizen, you are eligible for citizenship after being 2 years of marriage if you reside in Italy and 3 years if you live abroad. (You can apply after 18 months no matter where you are if you have a child together).</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-italian-nationality-law-affect-women>How does the Italian nationality law affect women?</h2>
<p>In summary, this law impacts citizenship by confirming decision 87 of 1975 for marriages happening after its entry into effect, and authorizing women who lost the Italian citizenship automatically by receiving a new citizenship as a consequence of marriage to reacquire it with a petition.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-apply-for-dual-citizenship-in-italy>How to apply for dual citizenship in Italy?</h2>
<p>NOTE: More and more Italian Consulates require that applicants for Italian Dual Citizenship fill out the AIRE Registration Form and have it ready the day of their appointment. You can download the enrolment form by visiting the Italian Consulate that has jurisdiction of the State where you reside.</p>
