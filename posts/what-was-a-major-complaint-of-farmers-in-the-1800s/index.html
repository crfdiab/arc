<h2 id=what-was-a-major-complaint-of-farmers-in-the-1800s>What was a major complaint of farmers in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>The Complaints of Farmers First, farmers claimed that farm prices were falling and, as a consequence, so were their incomes. They generally blamed low prices on over-production. Second, farmers alleged that monopolistic railroads and grain elevators charged unfair prices for their services.</p>
<h2 id=what-problems-did-farmers-face-in-the-late-19th-century-quizlet>What problems did farmers face in the late 19th century quizlet?</h2>
<p>What economic problems did many farmers face during the late 1800s? Prices for crops were falling and farmers often mortgaged their farms so that they could buy more land and produce more crops.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-railroads-unfair-to-farmers>How were railroads unfair to farmers?</h2>
<p>In their view banks charged outrageous interest rates, and monopolistic railroads not only charged outrageous rates but their rates were unfair and arbitrary in that the railroads charged farmers higher rates than they charged fellow industrialists.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-was-a-problem-faced-by-farmers-in-the-late-1800s>Which of the following was a problem faced by farmers in the late 1800s?</h2>
<p>Years of drought was a serious problem faced by farmers in the late 1800s.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-american-farmers-in-the-late-1800s-see-as-their-two-main-problems>What did American farmers in the late 1800s see as their two main problems?</h2>
<p>Farmers were facing many problems in the late 1800s. These problems included overproduction, low crop prices, high interest rates, high transportation costs, and growing debt.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-demands-of-farmers>What were the demands of farmers?</h2>
<p>The Farmers’ Demands Repealing the farm laws: The first and foremost demand of the protesting farmers’ organisations is the repeal of three new agricultural laws. Minimum support price: The second demand of farmers is the guarantee of Minimum Support Price (MSP) to ensure procurement of crops at a suitable price.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-was-a-problem-farmers-faced>Which of the following was a problem farmers faced?</h2>
<p>Many attributed their problems to discriminatory railroad rates, monopoly prices charged for farm machinery and fertilizer, an oppressively high tariff, an unfair tax structure, an inflexible banking system, political corruption, corporations that bought up huge tracks of land.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-one-of-the-problems-faced-by-farmers-in-the-late-1800s>What was one of the problems faced by farmers in the late 1800s?</h2>
<p>Farmers felt this was a major problem for them. During the late 1800s, farmers had serious economic problems. Most of their problems were actually caused by the fact that they were becoming too productive. They were producing too much, which cause prices to go down. The farmers did not really want to admit this, however.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-monopolies-affect-farmers-in-the-late-nineteenth-century>How did monopolies affect farmers in the late nineteenth century?</h2>
<p>Monopolies would never raise prices to become unmanageable, the prices during the late nineteenth century were actually on the lower side. This makes the complaints of the farmers about the monopolies not valid, the monopolies didn’t try to hurt the farmers business. Money problems were the largest complaint by farmers in the late 1800’s.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-farmers-complain-about-the-railroads>Why did the Farmers complain about the railroads?</h2>
<p>This price gouging, the farmers said, was unfair. They petitioned for the government to nationalize (take over and run) the railroads and charge fair prices. The complaints of the organized farm societies against the railroads had a lasting impact on the United States. Rather than socialize the railroads, the government regulated private capital.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-a-political-movement-in-the-late-1800s>Why was there a political movement in the late 1800s?</h2>
<p>Because conditions for farmers became harsher and harsher in the late 1800s, this period also saw the growth of a rural political movement that attempted to protect farmers.</p>
