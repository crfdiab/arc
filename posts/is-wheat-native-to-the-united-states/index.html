<p>The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE. Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis. Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million hectares, 2014).</p>
<h2 id=why-does-north-america-produce-the-most-wheat>Why does North America produce the most wheat?</h2>
<p>This type is primarily used for the production of bread flour. Hard red spring wheat is mostly cultivated in the Northern Plains area. Their wheat ears are mainly taken for protein blending purposes….Leading wheat producing U.S. states in 2019 and 2020 (in 1,000 bushels)</p>

<h2 id=is-wheat-illegal-to-grow-in-us>Is wheat illegal to grow in us?</h2>

<p>Spaniards brought wheat to Mexico in the early 1500s, where cultivation spread to the southwestern United States. Other explorers took grains of wheat to the eastern coast of the United States, where colonists —like President George Washington — grew it as one of their main cash crops.</p>

<h2 id=when-was-soft-wheat-introduced-to-the-united-states>When was soft wheat introduced to the United States?</h2>
<p>Until the 1870s, almost all U.S. wheat production consisted of “soft wheat” varieties. A “hard spring wheat” variety (originally from Central Europe) with a higher protein content (aka gluten) was introduced in the U.S. in the mid-1800s.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-they-start-growing-wheat-every-month>When did they start growing wheat every month?</h2>
<p>It wasn’t until the late 19th century that wheat production and consumption grew dramatically. One reason, as mentioned before, was the use of the new, hardier strains of wheat. (Today, wheat can be grown every month of the year somewhere in the world.)</p>
<h2 id=where-does-wheat-come-from-in-the-united-states>Where does wheat come from in the United States?</h2>
<p>Wheat may be further classified as follows: Hard red winter wheat ( HRW) with 40% production, the flour variety reported from the plains which extends from Texas north through Montana.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-producer-of-wheat-in-the-world>Which is the largest producer of wheat in the world?</h2>
<p>The United States is a major wheat-producing country, with output typically exceeded only by China, the European Union, and India. Acreage brought under wheat has, over the last several decades, varied with the wheat price.</p>
