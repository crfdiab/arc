<h2 id=how-many-days-is-enough-for-cairo>How many days is enough for Cairo?</h2>
<p>So bottom line is give Cairo at least 2 days and Luxor at least one additional day if not 2. So that’s 2-4 days total for doing Egypt as an add-on when you’re already in the region. Now, for those who are flying across the ocean to visit Egypt, you’ll want to stay a little longer.</p>
<h2 id=is-two-days-enough-in-cairo>Is two days enough in Cairo?</h2>
<p>2 days in Cairo gives you enough time to explore the city without feeling rushed. You won’t go on any day trips in this itinerary (see itinerary #2) so this is the perfect itinerary if you want to explore Cairo and Giza at a leisurely pace without organizing a day trip.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-plan-a-trip-to-egypt>How do I plan a trip to Egypt?</h2>
<p>They didn’t disappoint.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check professional guided day tours in Egypt here.</li>
<li>Check hotels in Egypt here.</li>
<li>We used this private tour to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx.</li>
<li>Book the sound and light show at Karnak Temple here.</li>
<li>Book a hot air balloon ride over the Valley of the Kings here (book in advance to ensure availability)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=is-cairo-a-safe-place-to-visit>Is Cairo a safe place to visit?</h2>
<p>In their safety and security section, the US government describes the crime levels in Cairo and Alexandria as “moderate.” Note that most crimes that target foreigners are crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing. Cairo is a busy city with lots of tourists and most of the hotels are running at almost full occupancy.</p>
<h2 id=are-the-pyramids-worth-seeing>Are the pyramids worth seeing?</h2>
<p>This site is not only one of the ancient world’s best-preserved wonders, it is also a destination many travelers yearn to see. From the time we are school children, this is one of the main societies we learn about. We are taught about the pharaohs and their deity-manifesting tombs.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-time-to-visit-cairo>What is the best time to visit Cairo?</h2>
<p>The best times to visit Cairo are from March to April and from October to November. These short shoulder seasons welcome comfortable temperatures, fewer crowds and low hotel rates on most days of the week.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-time-to-visit-cairo-egypt>What is the best time to visit Cairo Egypt?</h2>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-go-to-egypt-and-see-the-pyramids>How much does it cost to go to Egypt and see the pyramids?</h2>
<p>The great pyramids and Cairo Museum are a popular combination for a day trip and will cost about $40 per person. A full day tour through Cairo including the Citadel and Khan el Khalili market is approximately $60 per person.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-in-cairo-in-3-days>What to do in Cairo in 3 days?</h2>
<p>Our 3-day suggested itinerary showcases the best of Cairo and what are the things you can accomplish in less than 1 week including a visit to Giza’s gargantuan pyramids. Depending on your interests and travel priorities, you can certainly mix and match destinations, activities, and attractions to create your one itinerary.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-travel-advisories-for-cairo-egypt>Are there any travel advisories for Cairo Egypt?</h2>
<p>Please consult government travel advisories before booking. The WHO is closely monitoring the coronavirus and more information can be found here. With three days in Cairo, you can cover a lot of ground, including the city’s famous Egyptian Museum, the Giza Pyramids, and the ancient Ptolemaic city of Alexandria.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-go-to-cairo-egypt>How much does it cost to go to Cairo Egypt?</h2>
<p>We started in Cairo, flew to Aswan, went on a nile cruise from Aswan to Luxor and then flew back to Cairo. We paid approximately US$1200 per person not including hotels, which we opted to book ourselves. Your Egypt Tours can book your accommodation on your behalf if you prefer.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-travel-to-egypt>What’s the best way to travel to Egypt?</h2>
<p>How to get to Egypt: Egypt is well-connected by international airlines with major airports in Cairo, Luxor, Sharm El Sheikh and Hurghada. We spent 1 week in Jordan before flying direct from Amman to Cairo on Royal Jordanian Airlines. The flight took just under an hour and a half.</p>
