<h2 id=can-volcanoes-be-on-land>Can volcanoes be on land?</h2>
<p>Some volcanoes, like those that form the Hawaiian Islands, occur in the interior of plates at areas called “hot spots.” Although most of the active volcanoes we see on land occur where plates collide, the greatest number of the Earth’s volcanoes are hidden from view, occurring on the ocean floor along spreading ridges.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-a-volcano-erupts-on-land>What happens when a volcano erupts on land?</h2>
<p>The immediate area is usually evacuated quickly to keep people safe. Extremely hot lava can also cause lots of damage, burning through towns and farmland. The ash from a volcano can also cause breathing problems, and create travel disruptions, as it lowers the visibility for pilots.</p>
<h2 id=what-boundary-makes-volcanoes-on-land>What boundary makes volcanoes on land?</h2>
<p>The two types of plate boundaries that are most likely to produce volcanic activity are divergent plate boundaries and convergent plate boundaries. At a divergent boundary, tectonic plates move apart from one another.</p>
<h2 id=does-lava-turn-into-land>Does lava turn into land?</h2>
<p>New land is created in volcanic eruptions. New land may also emerge from lava that erupts from beneath the water. This is one way that new land is created. Lava erupts into the Pacific Ocean in Hawaii, creating new land.</p>
<h2 id=can-lava-go-in-water>Can lava go in water?</h2>
<p>When lava meets the sea it cools quickly while boiling the ocean into steam. The billowing steams clouds can be deadly as they contain small glass shards of fragmented lava and acid mist from sea water.</p>
<h2 id=what-landforms-are-created-by-volcanoes>What landforms are created by volcanoes?</h2>
<p>Volcanoes and Vents. The most obvious landforms created by lava are volcanoes, most commonly as cinder cones, composite volcanoes, and shield volcanoes.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-facts-about-volcanoes>What are facts about volcanoes?</h2>
<p>10 Interesting Facts About Volcanoes 1. There are Three Major Kinds of Volcanoes: 2. Volcanoes Erupt Because of Escaping Magma: 3. Volcanoes can be Active, Dormant or Extinct: 4. Volcanoes can Grow Quickly: 5. There are 20 Volcanoes Erupting Right Now: 6. Volcanoes are Dangerous: 7. Supervolcanoes are Really Dangerous:</p>
<h2 id=how-do-volcanoes-change-earths-surface>How do volcanoes change earth’s surface?</h2>
<p>After a volcanic eruption has taken place, the extremely hot lava that has been released will flow to the earth’s surface, changing the configuration of the earth’s surface upon its landing. This change occurs, as when the lava cools, it sets upon the ground, consequently producing solid rock.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-volcanoes-form>How do volcanoes form?</h2>
<p>Volcanoes are formed when magma from within the Earth’s upper mantle works its way to the surface. At the surface, it erupts to form lava flows and ash deposits. Over time as the volcano continues to erupt, it will get bigger and bigger.</p>
