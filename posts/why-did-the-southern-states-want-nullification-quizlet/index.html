<h2 id=why-did-the-southern-states-want-nullification-quizlet>Why did the southern states want nullification quizlet?</h2>
<p>Law passed by congress that raised taxes on iron, textiles, and other products. Many South Carolina farmers felt that this law was unfair and was forced against them. Many were afraid that their ability to own slaves were to be taken away, so they wanted the ability to nullify. …</p>
<h2 id=why-did-south-carolina-pass-the-nullification-act>Why did South Carolina pass the Nullification Act?</h2>
<p>why did south Carolina pass the Nullification Act? South Carolina disliked the protective tariff, and even when the Congress lowered the tariff a little in 1832, South Carolina was not satisfied. The high tariff means they had to pay more. Therefore, the south did not profit, but was hurt by this law.</p>
<h2 id=why-would-southern-planters-support-texas-as-a-new-state>Why would Southern planters support Texas as a new state?</h2>
<p>Why would southern planters support Texas as a new state? If Texas joined the Union, its cotton would be part of the South’s cotton market, and it would not be a safe place for escaped slaves. Those who feared annexation believed it would make the slavery issue worse and cause war with Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=what-made-the-largest-group-of-whites-in-the-south>What made the largest group of whites in the South?</h2>
<p>The farmers who did not have slaves – yeomen – made up the largest group of whites in the South.</p>
<h2 id=what-led-to-the-nullification-crisis>What led to the nullification crisis?</h2>
<p>The Nullification Crisis was caused by the tariff acts imposed by the federal government. The 1828 Tariff Abominations increased the tariffs up to 50%, thus igniting the nullification crisis. Calhoun believed that the tariff system would bring poverty to the South as the southern states were agricultural in nature.</p>
<h2 id=did-south-carolina-nullify-the-force-bill>Did South Carolina nullify the force bill?</h2>
<p>Congress later passed the Tariff Act of 1832, which only slightly lowered the previous levies. South Carolina then rescinded its nullification of the tariff laws but nullified the Force Bill, though its provisions were no longer necessary.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-largest-group-of-people-in-the-south>What was the largest group of people in the South?</h2>
<p>According to the most recent census data, white people are now the largest racial/ethnic group in the South End, surpassing people of Asian descent. The data, which averages the years 2013 to 2017, shows there are about 31,000 white people in the area of Seattle south of Interstate 90, up by about 5,700 since 2010.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-only-state-to-threaten-nullification-of-a-congressional-action>Who was the only state to threaten nullification of a congressional action?</h2>
<p>The southern states were the only states that threatened nullification of a congressional action. Westerners were not affected by the economic depression in 1819. The Missouri Compromise ended the slave trade, but not slavery in the nation’s capital.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-theory-of-nullification-in-the-us-constitution>What is the theory of nullification in the US Constitution?</h2>
<p>Nullification (U.S. Constitution) The theory of nullification is based on a view that the states formed the Union by an agreement (or “compact”) among the states, and that as creators of the federal government, the states have the final authority to determine the limits of the power of that government.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-supreme-court-reject-nullification-in-cooper-vaaron>Why did the Supreme Court reject nullification in Cooper v.aaron?</h2>
<p>In the 1950s, southern states attempted to use nullification and interposition to prevent integration of their schools. These attempts failed when the Supreme Court again rejected nullification in Cooper v. Aaron, explicitly holding that the states may not nullify federal law.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-supreme-court-decision-that-nullified-the-fugitive-slave-act>What was the Supreme Court decision that nullified the Fugitive Slave Act?</h2>
<p>The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions were rejected by the other states. The Supreme Court rejected nullification attempts in a series of decisions in the 19th century, including Ableman v. Booth, which rejected Wisconsin’s attempt to nullify the Fugitive Slave Act.</p>
