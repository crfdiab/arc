<p>What Really Happened during Paul Revere’s Ride? The purpose of Paul Revere’s midnight ride, as you may recall from your high school history class, was to race to Concord to warn Patriots Samuel Adams and John Hancock that British troops – 700 of them – were marching to Concord to arrest them.</p>

<p>On the evening of April 18, 1775, Paul Revere was sent for by Dr. Joseph Warren and instructed to ride to Lexington, Massachusetts, to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock that British troops were marching to arrest them.</p>

<p>As the British departed, Boston Patriots Paul Revere and William Dawes set out on horseback from the city to warn Adams and Hancock and rouse the Minutemen. On April 18, he ordered British troops to march against Concord and Lexington.</p>

<p>Then, at about 10 p.m. on April 18, 1775, Revere set out in the dark from his North Boston home by horse with two other riders to reach Adams and Hancock. The riders met the pair in Lexington and enabled the revolutionaries to avoid arrest.</p>

<p>Paul Revere’s midnight ride, April 18, 1775. On this night in 1775, Paul Revere was instructed by the Sons of Liberty to ride to Lexington, Mass., to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock that British troops were marching to arrest them.</p>

<p>This meant that ship’s papers, legal documents, licenses, newspapers, even playing cards were to be taxed in order to raise money for the Crown’s frontier ventures. Many colonists felt that they should only be taxed by their own colonial legislatures — hence the slogan, “No taxation without representation.”</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-bell-ringing-in-paul-reveres-midnight-ride>Why was the bell ringing in Paul Revere’s Midnight Ride?</h2>
<p>As the group drew closer to Lexington, the town bell began to clang rapidly, upon which one of the captives proclaimed to the British soldiers: “The bell’s ringing! The town’s alarmed, and you’re all dead men!”</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-send-a-column-to-kill-paul-revere>Why did the British send a column to kill Paul Revere?</h2>
<p>In mid-to-late April 1775, the British learned that the colonial militias were stockpiling arms and ammunition for rebellion. Thus, they sent a column of about 400 regulars to Concord on the night of 18 April to destroy the cache.</p>
