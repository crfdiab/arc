<h2 id=what-are-the-consequences-of-environmental-degradation>What are the consequences of environmental degradation?</h2>
<p>Consequences include increased poverty, overcrowding, famine, weather extremes, species loss, acute and chronic medical illnesses, war and human rights abuses, and an increasingly unstable global situation that portends Malthusian chaos and disaster.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-and-consequences-of-environmental-degradation-in-india>What are the causes and consequences of environmental degradation in India?</h2>
<p>The main causes of the land degradation includes climate change, land clearance and deforestation, depletion of soil nutrients through poor farming practices, overgrazing and over grafting. In India, water erosion is the most prominent reason of land degradation.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-main-consequences-of-environmental-degradation>What are the two main consequences of environmental degradation?</h2>
<p>“Environmental degradation is the deterioration of the environment through depletion of resources such as air, water and soil; the destruction of ecosystems; habitat destruction; the extinction of wildlife; and pollution.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-consequences-of-environmental>What are the consequences of environmental?</h2>
<p>Humans impact the physical environment in many ways: overpopulation, pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. Changes like these have triggered climate change, soil erosion, poor air quality, and undrinkable water.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-environment-being-degraded-in-india>How is the environment being degraded in India?</h2>
<p>deterioration of the environment through consumption of assets, like, air, water and soil. The destruction of environments and the eradication of wildlife. Air pollution, water pollution, garbage, and pollution of the natural environment are all challenges for India.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-degradation-of-natural-resources-affecting-the-environment>How is the degradation of Natural Resources affecting the environment?</h2>
<p>Abstract- Degradation of natural resources and environmental pollutions are most concerning subject in present day context among the social scientist as well as the environmentalist. As the population increase day by day the amenities are not improve simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-environmental-problems-in-north-eastern-india>What are the major environmental problems in north eastern India?</h2>
<p>1. Commissioning of effluent treatment plant. 2. Providing asbestos sheet brick wall around the flare pits to prevent light and radiation of heat to the nearby areas. 3. Multiple flaring instead of single flaring. 4. Cold flaring of gas from October to December to safeguard the adjacent paddy cultivation.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-overpopulation-in-india>What are the effects of overpopulation in India?</h2>
<p>In particular, India’s overpopulation has led to a large gap between the wealthy and the poor, who make up around 60% of India’s total population (Ninkovic et al., 2013). With more people in the state, it has become very difficult for many Indians to obtain a well-paying job.</p>
