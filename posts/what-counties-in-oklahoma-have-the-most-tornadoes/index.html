<h2 id=has-a-tornado-ever-hit-oklahoma-city>Has a tornado ever hit Oklahoma City?</h2>
<p>Some other interesting facts about OKC tornadoes: Thirteen violent tornadoes (eleven F4/EF4 and two F5/EF5) have struck the immediate OKC area. The most recent was on May 20, 2013. The record for tornadoes in a single day is 5, which occurred during tornado outbreaks on June 8, 1974, May 31, 2013, and October 9, 2018.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-most-tornadoes-in-oklahoma-since-1950>Where are the most tornadoes in Oklahoma since 1950?</h2>

<h2 id=which-is-the-state-with-the-most-tornadoes>Which is the state with the most tornadoes?</h2>
<p>The two states that have the highest average number of tornadoes each year are Texas and Kansas. There are certain states in the Plains and Midwest that also have many tornadoes on a yearly basis. The areas of the United States that have the fewest tornadoes annually are in the West and Northeast.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-more-tornadoes-in-moore-or-cleveland-county>Are there more tornadoes in Moore or Cleveland County?</h2>
<p>“Don’t move to Moore…that town is prone to tornadoes”. And yes…the town has had some pretty devastating tornadoes lately. But believe it or not there are areas in Oklahoma that have seen more tornadoes than Moore or even Cleveland County. From The Oklahoma Mesonet: Caddo County has had the most tornado reports since 1950 with 116.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-tornado-hit-in-logan-county-ok>Where did tornado hit in Logan County OK?</h2>
<p>Severe thunderstorms moving along an east-southeastward path in central Oklahoma produced tornadoes, damaging winds, hail and rain from southwestern Logan County, through northeastern Oklahoma County, and into southwestern Lincoln County.</p>
