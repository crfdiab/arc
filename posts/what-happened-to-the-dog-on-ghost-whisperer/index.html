<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-dog-on-ghost-whisperer>What happened to the dog on Ghost Whisperer?</h2>
<p>Homer is a ghost dog and appeared in the episode “Lost Boys.” He lived with Rat, Vic, Marty, and Ernie in the orphanage with them and died in the fire 50 years ago with the three of them except Ernie.</p>
<h2 id=is-melindas-baby-jims>Is Melinda’s Baby Jim’s?</h2>
<p>In Season 5, Melinda and Jim have a son, who they name Aiden Lucas, after Jim’s father and Sam Lucas. However, it is later revealed that he is more powerful than his mother, as he can not only see the earthbound, but also the spirits who have crossed over.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-jim-die-on-ghost-whisperer>Why did Jim die on Ghost Whisperer?</h2>
<p>He died in a hospital from an embolism after being shot accidentally by a cop when police responded to a home where a depressed, dumped-at-the-altar groom was holed up. What does Conrad think of Jim’s death and how will it affect his role on the series?</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-father-of-melinda-gordon-baby>Who is the father of Melinda Gordon baby?</h2>
<table><tr><th>Melinda Gordon</th></tr><tr><td>Family</td><td>Beth Gordon (mother) Paul Eastman (father; deceased) Tom Gordon (step-father; deceased) Mary Ann (grandmother, deceased)</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jim Clancy (m. 2005–09; widowed) Sam Lucas (m. 2009-present) (Jim’s ghost possesses the body)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Unnamed child (with Jim; miscarriage) Aiden Lucas (son, with Jim)</td></tr></table>

<p>His character is dead, and David Conrad of CBS’ “Ghost Whisperer” is loving it. The actor, who plays Jim Clancy, the husband of the ghost whisperer herself, Melinda (Jennifer Love Hewitt), was killed off in last week’s episode.</p>
<h2 id=is-melindas-baby-jims-or-sams>Is Melinda’s Baby Jim’s or Sam’s?</h2>
<p>In Season 5, Melinda and Jim have a son, who they name Aiden Lucas, after Jim’s father and Sam Lucas. Melinda also fell pregnant during the early Season Four with Jim, but suffered a miscarriage because her body could not support the baby.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-ghost-whisperer-based-on-a-true-story>Is the Ghost Whisperer based on a true story?</h2>
<p>2. There’s a real Ghost Whisperer. Series creator John Gray based Melinda on Mary Ann Winkowski, a paranormal investigator who communicates with spirits who have not yet crossed over. Winkowski discovered her abilities at age seven and was encouraged by her grandmother (like Melinda).</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-ghost-whisperer-when-she-started>How old was Ghost Whisperer when she started?</h2>
<p>The Waco, Texas native was just 26 when Ghost Whisperer debuted on CBS, but she was already a 15-year industry veteran. As a Top 40 recording artist, TV actress ( Party Of Five ), and movie star ( I Know What You Did Last Summer ), Hewitt brought substantial show business clout to the series.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-melinda-gray-when-she-met-ghost-whisperer>How old was Melinda Gray when she met Ghost Whisperer?</h2>
<p>Winkowski discovered her abilities at age seven and was encouraged by her grandmother (like Melinda). Gray and Winkowski first met at a Starbucks a year before the series premiered, a meeting Winkowski said was also attended by ghosts (who apparently paid for their own coffee).</p>
<h2 id=who-is-beth-from-ghost-whisperer-related-to>Who is Beth from Ghost Whisperer related to?</h2>
<p>Like Melinda, Beth has the gift to communicate with the dead. But unlike her daughter, she rejected it. And that rejection contributes to a troubled relationship between the two. Archer’s appearances on Ghost Whisperer are few, but the episodes are important to the show’s overall mythology.</p>
