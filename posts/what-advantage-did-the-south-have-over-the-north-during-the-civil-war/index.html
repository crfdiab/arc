<h2 id=what-advantages-did-the-south-have-against-the-north>What advantages did the South have against the North?</h2>

<p>During the Civil War, What Advantages Did the South Have Over the North?

They also had free labor at home in the form of slaves so that they could go to war without worrying about their farms.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-north-fight-in-the-civil-war>Why did the north fight in the Civil War?</h2>
<p>The North constantly had to fight to keep up popular support for the war. Motivation. The South was fighting to preserve their homes from an intruder. The North on the other hand was fighting to preserve the union. To abolish slavery was added later, and this was cold comfort to most Northerners who had never seen a slave before.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-south-during-the-civil-war>Who was the leader of the south during the Civil War?</h2>
<p>It would be more nearly correct to state that the military leaders of the South were far superior to those of the North. General Winfield Scott had offered command of Union forces to Robert E. Lee, who declined because his conscience would not let him fight against his native Virginia.</p>
