<h2 id=why-did-colonists-in-maryland-and-the-carolinas-enslave-native-americans-and-used-african-slaves>Why did colonists in Maryland and the Carolinas enslave Native Americans and used African slaves?</h2>
<p>Maryland colonists turned to importing indentured and enslaved Africans to satisfy the labor demand. By the 18th century, Maryland had developed into a plantation colony and slave society, requiring extensive numbers of field hands for the labor-intensive commodity crop of tobacco.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-slavery-take-root-in-the-colonies>Why did slavery take root in the colonies?</h2>
<p>The major reason that slavery took root in the colonies was due to a shortage of labor. The colonists earlier attempted to use the Native populations, but their knowledge of the land made them difficult to enslave.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-slavery-common-in-the-english-colonies>Why was slavery common in the English colonies?</h2>
<p>Slavery existed widely throughout the Americas long before the Europeans showed up. If your just referring to slavery in the English colonies and the US, Europeans, Indians, and Africans were all used as slaves by Europeans. The Africans became the preferred slaves because of their resistance to desease and inability to escape.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonist-choose-africa-for-slaves>Why did the colonist choose Africa for slaves?</h2>
<p>The natural talents of Africans met the needs of the colonists. Africans, unlike the colonists, were experienced in agriculture, livestock and raising crops. The colonists quickly became dependent on the cheap labor of African slaves.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-slavery-like-for-native-american-women>What was slavery like for Native American women?</h2>
<p>Native American women were at risk for rape whether they were enslaved or not; during the early colonial years, settlers were disproportionately male. They turned to Native women for sexual relationships. Both Native American and African enslaved women suffered rape and sexual harassment by male slaveholders and other white men.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-definition-of-slavery-in-1705>What was the definition of slavery in 1705?</h2>
<p>The Virginia General Assembly defined some terms of slavery in 1705: All servants imported and brought into the Country who were not Christians in their native Country shall be accounted and be slaves. All Negro, mulatto and Indian slaves within this dominion shall be held to be real estate.</p>
