<h2 id=what-lake-in-africa-is-drying-up>What lake in Africa is drying up?</h2>
<p>Lake Chad<br>
Lake Chad has literally gone from being an oasis in the desert, to being just desert. Spanning the countries of Chad, Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon and bordering the Sahara desert, Lake Chad has contracted by a massive 95% between 1963 and 2001.</p>
<h2 id=does-east-africa-have-water>Does East Africa have water?</h2>
<p>Eastern Africa is home to some of the greatest water sources in the world. The three most notable water bodies and systems and of relevance to the East Africa region include: Lake Victoria – Africa’s largest lake and the world’s second-largest freshwater lake, and.</p>
<h2 id=what-water-is-east-of-africa>What water is east of Africa?</h2>
<p>Indian Ocean<br>
Africa is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Red Sea to the northeast, Indian Ocean to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.</p>
<h2 id=what-formed-the-great-lakes-of-east-africa>What formed the Great Lakes of East Africa?</h2>
<p>A rift is a weak place in Earth’s crust due to the separation of two tectonic plates, often accompanied by a graben, or trough, in which lake water can collect. This rift began when East Africa, impelled by currents in the mantle, began separating from the rest of Africa, moving to the northeast.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-a-lake-dries-up>What happens when a lake dries up?</h2>
<p>Scientists have warned that continued decline of Lake Urmia could have huge impacts on the area. These include a changing local climate – hitting agriculture, livelihoods and heath, increasing the salinity of the water, destroying ecosystems and wetland habitats and increasing the chances of wind blown ‘salt storms’.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-water-in-africa-dirty>Why is the water in Africa dirty?</h2>
<p>Agriculture plays a major role in water contamination. Farming results in the release of large quantities of organic matter, agrochemicals, sediments, and drug residues. The use of fertilizers and excreta at farms cause nitrates and phosphates to enter bodies of water, leading to eutrophication.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-lakes-not-dry-up>Why do lakes not dry up?</h2>
<p>So why don’t lakes just dry up? Some do. For a lake to keep its water over time, it has to be replenished. So these sorts of lakes may also get underground water that flows in from underneath the lake – the lake floor may be an area of water input, rather than a drain for the lake.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-lakes-in-africa-that-are-still-there>Are there any lakes in Africa that are still there?</h2>
<p>One of just a few lakes that has not shrunk due to water diversion, Assal is still an important natural resource for the local economy. The lake is 10 times more saline than seawater, and its salt is harvested for distribution across Africa and Europe. 6. Lake Chad, Chad/Niger/Nigeria/Cameroon</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-great-lakes-of-east-africa>Where are the Great Lakes of East Africa?</h2>
<p>Lake Malawi lies in the Eastern Rift branch. Just north of Lake Malawi is the western branch, which runs north along the eastern border of Zaire. Within this branch of the Great Rift Valley are Lake Tanganyika and several other smaller lakes, including Lakes Edward and Albert.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-lakes-of-the-world-declining>Why are the lakes of the world declining?</h2>
<p>According to a study by University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers, the lake is now one 20th of the size it was 35 years ago. Massive irrigation projects, an increasingly dry climate, and declining rainfall have all contributed to its decline. This montage shows the lake in 1963, 1973, 1987 and 1997.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-lakes-that-are-disappearing>What are the names of the lakes that are disappearing?</h2>
<p>10 Lakes That Are Disappearing or Already Gone 1. Owens Lake, United States. The unquenchable thirst of Los Angeles is to blame for the dust bowl now known as Owens… 2. Aral Sea, Kazakhstan. Once an oasis in central Asia and the fourth largest body of fresh water in the world, the Aral… 3. Dead …</p>
