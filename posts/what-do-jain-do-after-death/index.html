<h2 id=what-do-jain-do-after-death>What do Jain do after death?</h2>
<p>In order to keep the Earth clean and pure, Jains cremate those who pass away. The cremation is done as soon as possible and cannot be done between sunset and sunrise of the day following the death.</p>
<h2 id=what-religion-doesnt-believe-in-afterlife>What religion doesn’t believe in afterlife?</h2>
<p>Jehovah’s Witnesses occasionally use terms such as “afterlife” to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand Ecclesiastes 9:5 to preclude belief in an immortal soul. Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the Great Flood or at Armageddon, are given no hope of an afterlife.</p>
<h2 id=what-religion-is-afterlife>What religion is afterlife?</h2>
<p>The sacred texts in Christianity, Judaism and Islam talk of an afterlife, so for followers of these faiths life after death has been promised by God. For Buddhists, belief in reincarnation is based on the tradition that the Buddha remembered his past lives when he reached enlightenment .</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jains-think-about-life>What did Jains think about life?</h2>
<p>Jains believe that life (which equals soul) is sacred regardless of faith, caste, race, or even species. Do not injure, abuse, oppress, enslave, insult, torment, torture or kill any creature or living being.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-jainism-say-about-death>What does Jainism say about death?</h2>
<p>According to Jainism, Ātman (soul) is eternal and never dies. According to Tattvartha Sutra which is a compendium of Jain principles, the function of matter (pudgala) is to contribute to pleasure, suffering, life and death of living beings.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-shinto-bury-their-dead>How do Shinto bury their dead?</h2>
<p>The vast majority of Japanese people are cremated. In the Shinto faith, it’s very important that the family treats these ashes according to ritual and protocol. Once the body is cremated, the family picks bones out of the ash remains with chopsticks. The family buries most of the ashes in a graveyard.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-life-after-death-in-bible>What is life after death in Bible?</h2>
<p>Christians interpret the teachings of the Bible on life after death to mean that humans will have a spiritual existence after death, rather than a physical one. Belief in life after death may be influenced by the meaning and purpose that it gives to the lives of Christians.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-jains-not-drink-alcohol>Why do Jains not drink alcohol?</h2>
<p>The most important reason against alcohol consumption is the effect of alcohol on the mind and soul. In Jainism, any action or reaction that alter or impacts our mind is violence/himsa towards our own self, which is a five-sense human being. Violence to other five sense beings or to our self is same violence.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-jainism-beliefs>What are Jainism beliefs?</h2>
<p>Like Hindus and Buddhists, Jains believe in reincarnation. This cycle of birth, death, and rebirth is determined by one’s karma. Jains believe bad karma is caused by harming living things. To avoid bad karma, Jains must practice ahimsa, a strict code of nonviolence.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-think-there-is-an-afterlife-for-jains>Do you think there is an afterlife for Jains?</h2>
<p>The idea of an afterlife in Jainism might exist, but not in the way that most other people think about it. To the Jains, life is a path to spiritual enlightenment and eventual liberation guided by the Tirthankaras all the way to Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-jainism-believe-about-life-after-death>What does Jainism believe about life after death?</h2>
<p>Jainism believes that all people are caught in an endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. Jainism stresses detachment from the world and austerity.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-jains-who-believe-in-god>Are there any Jains who believe in God?</h2>
<p>Jainism and God – the atheistic side. Jains do not believe that the universe was created by God or by any other creative spirit. Jain writings are scornful of the very idea:</p>
<h2 id=do-you-believe-in-reincarnation-if-you-are-a-jain>Do You Believe in reincarnation if you are a Jain?</h2>
<p>One life, however, might not be enough to get there, and depending on the sect of Jainism to which you belong, you might not be able to get there at all if you were born a female. That’s where reincarnation comes into play. If you’re a Jain, then how you live your life affects what happens to you after you die.</p>
