<h2 id=what-emergency-supplies-do-i-need-for-an-earthquake>What emergency supplies do I need for an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Basic Disaster Supplies Kit</p>
<ul>
<li>Water (one gallon per person per day for several days, for drinking and sanitation)</li>
<li>Food (at least a three-day supply of non-perishable food)</li>
<li>Battery-powered or hand crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert.</li>
<li>Flashlight.</li>
<li>First aid kit.</li>
<li>Extra batteries.</li>
<li>Whistle (to signal for help)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-earthquake-preparation>What is earthquake preparation?</h2>
<p>Create an earthquake safety plan for you and loved ones, including pets. Identify safe places in each room of your home. Know your risk for earthquakes in your area and what you must do to stay safe. Practice Drop, Cover, and Hold On with each member of your household. Make or purchase earthquake safety kits.</p>
<h2 id=what-safety-measures-you-are-going-to-suggest-if-youre-living-near-an-active-fault>What safety measures you are going to suggest if you’re living near an active fault?</h2>
<p>Know your risk. Research the area and find out if you live near an active fault line. Check whether the ground around you is more susceptible to the effects of an earthquake. You should also be aware of seismic hazards. These hazards are secondary dangers that could be triggered by an earthquake.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-dangerous-to-live-in-an-area-near-fault-lines>Why is it dangerous to live in an area near fault lines?</h2>
<p>The danger of living near fault lines Living near fault lines is inherently dangerous but difficult to avoid. The dangers people face include not only tremors but also other threats: Widespread smoke and ash can pollute the air and block out the sun for miles in every direction.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-you-need-an-earthquake-emergency-kit>Why do you need an earthquake emergency kit?</h2>
<p>Earthquakes have the energy to disrupt water, electricity and other supplies. The effect can be such that they can leave the roads impassable. Thus, you must prepare an emergency kit in advance.

<h2 id=what-should-i-stock-up-on-after-an-earthquake>What should I stock up on after an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Stock up now on emergency supplies that can be used after an earthquake. These supplies should include a first aid kit, survival kits for the home, automobile, and workplace, and emergency water and food.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-you-do-in-case-of-an-earthquake>What should you do in case of an earthquake?</h2>
<p>The key to being safe during an earthquake is preparation. While an earthquake safety kit will be of help after an earthquake, nothing replaces the conversations you have with your family members before an earthquake. Create an earthquake safety plan for you and loved ones which includes your stay-in -place safety kit.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-need-to-be-prepared-for-disasters>Why do people need to be prepared for disasters?</h2>
<p>Being prepared can reduce the fear, anxiety and losses that accompany disasters. Communities, families, and individuals should know what to do in the event of an earthquake and where to seek shelter during a fire. They should be ready to evacuate their homes and take refuge in public shelters and know how to care for their basic medical needs.</p>
