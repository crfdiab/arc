<h2 id=what-happened-to-fayette-michigan>What happened to Fayette Michigan?</h2>
<p>The town’s success would be short-lived though, as the company exhausted the area’s hardwoods. Then, the Jackson Iron Company closed its Fayette smelting operations in 1891 when the iron market declined. Although some residents stayed and farmed, many left Fayette.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-fayette-historic-state-park-important-to-michigan>Why is Fayette Historic State Park important to Michigan?</h2>
<p>Once a bustling industrial community that manufactured charcoal pig iron between 1867 and 1891, Fayette offers visitors historic buildings set among the unmatched serenity of a Lake Michigan harbor, white cliffs and verdant forests.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-fayette-become-a-state-park>When did Fayette become a state park?</h2>
<p>1959<br>
It continued in that capacity until 1946 when another individual purchased it, who eventually fell behind on taxes. Lastly, it was purchased by the Escanaba Paper Company, and was swapped to the Michigan government for timberland. As a result, Fayette became a state park in 1959.</p>
<h2 id=are-dogs-allowed-at-fayette-historic-state-park>Are dogs allowed at Fayette Historic State Park?</h2>
<p>Call for availability and reservations: 906-644-2603. Pets are welcome. Campers and day visitors may bring their pets to the park as long as they are quiet and are kept on a 6-foot leash. For your pet’s and visitor safety, no pets are allowed in the historic buildings or on the swimming beaches.</p>
<h2 id=does-brimley-state-park-have-showers>Does Brimley State Park have showers?</h2>
<p>Great state park camping with clean, well-maintained restrooms and showers.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-fayette-a-ghost-town>Why is Fayette a ghost town?</h2>
<p>In 1891, Jackson Iron ended its smelting operation, and most residents moved on to other places to find work, turning Fayette into a ghost town.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-hours-for-kitch-iti-kipi>What are the hours for Kitch ITI Kipi?</h2>
<p>Kitch-iti-kipi is an ADA-accessible attraction; both the trail leading to the raft and the raft itself are wheelchair friendly. The state park is open 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily and there is no charge to ride the Kitch-iti-Kipi raft. Visitors, however, will need a Michigan recreation pass to enter the state park.</p>
<h2 id=is-detroit-still-a-ghost-town>Is Detroit still a ghost town?</h2>
<p>Since the 1960s however, the city has faced a prolonged period of decline which culminated in Detroit becoming the largest US city to ever file for bankruptcy in 2013. Abandoned buildings are now an ever-present feature of the cityscape, with some even going as far as labelling it The Abandoned City.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-belle-isle-zoo-closed>Why is Belle Isle Zoo closed?</h2>
<p>Then-mayor Kwame Kilpatrick decided to keep the zoo closed, citing funding issues and the city’s growing deficit. In 2004, a public campaign by groups including the Friends of Belle Isle resulted in the passage of a local bond issue to fund reopening the park.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-bears-in-brimley-michigan>Are there bears in Brimley Michigan?</h2>
<p>Common catches include snowshoe hare, deer, and ruffled grouse. Be aware that this is bear country and black bears are often spotted in the area.</p>
