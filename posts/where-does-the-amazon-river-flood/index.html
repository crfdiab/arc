<h2 id=where-does-the-amazon-river-flood>Where does the Amazon river flood?</h2>
<p>Generally, flooding occurs in the northern Amazon Basin (above the Equator) while floods are receding in the basin’s southern part (below the Equator). Other parts can even experience two floods per year, which are different in intensity.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-the-amazon-river-flood>How much does the Amazon river flood?</h2>
<p>Every year, the river rises more than 9 metres (30 ft), flooding the surrounding forests, known as várzea (“flooded forests”).</p>
<h2 id=where-does-amazon-river-start-and-end>Where does Amazon River start and end?</h2>
<p>Atlantic Ocean<br>
Amazon River/Mouths<br>
It originates high in the Andes Mountains of Peru and flows eastwards on a meandering 4,000-mile (6,400 km) journey, roughly one-third of its length in Peru and two-thirds in Brazil, before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean on Brazil’s northeastern coast.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-the-amazon-flood>How often does the Amazon flood?</h2>
<p>Analyzing more than 100 years of records measuring Amazon River levels in the port of Manaus in Brazil, they found extreme floods that occurred roughly once every 20 years in the first part of last century are now happening about every four years.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-amazon-river-flood-in-brazil>Why did the Amazon River flood in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Scientists analyzed data points from the past century and believe the increase in flooding is linked to global warming. Scientists have measured the river’s water levels for 113 years at the Port of Manaus in Brazil. Over time, they found that large flooding events and extreme droughts have gone up over the past 20 to 30 years.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-rain-fall-on-the-amazon-river>When does the rain fall on the Amazon River?</h2>
<p>The upper course of the Amazon has two annual floods, and the river is subject to the alternate influence of the tributaries that descend from the Peruvian Andes (where rains fall from October to January) and from the Ecuadoran Andes (where rains fall from March to July).</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-water-in-the-amazon-river-basin-come-from>Where does the water in the Amazon River basin come from?</h2>
<p>The main influx of atmospheric water vapour into the basin comes from the east. About half of the precipitation that falls originates from the Atlantic Ocean; the other half comes from evapotranspiration from the tropical forest and associated convectional storms.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-speed-of-the-amazon-river>What is the average speed of the Amazon River?</h2>
<p>The average velocity of the Amazon is about 1.5 miles per hour, a speed that increases considerably at flood time. The rise and fall of the water is controlled by events external to the floodplain. The floods of the Amazon are not disasters but rather distinctive, anticipated events.</p>
