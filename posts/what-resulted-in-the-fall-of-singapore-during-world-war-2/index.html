<p>The Japanese victory was decisive, resulting in the Japanese capture of Singapore and the largest British surrender in history….Battle of Singapore.</p>
<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>8–15 February 1942</th></tr><tr><td>Result</td><td>Japanese victory Japanese occupation of Singapore</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-did-australia-get-affected-by-ww2>How did Australia get affected by ww2?</h2>
<p>In addition, Australia came under direct attack for the first time in its post-colonial history. Its casualties from enemy action during the war were 27,073 killed and 23,477 wounded. The final effects of the war also contributed to the development of a more diverse and cosmopolitan Australian society.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-australian-soldiers-died-in-the-fall-of-singapore>How many Australian soldiers died in the fall of Singapore?</h2>
<p>In London, Prime Minister Winston Churchill announced that the fall of Singapore was the ‘worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history’. For Australia too, the fall of Singapore was a disaster. More than 15,000 Australian soldiers were captured. Of these, more than 7000 would die as prisoners of war.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-fall-of-singapore>Who was involved in the fall of Singapore?</h2>
<p>This event was one of the largest and most dramatic reverses suffered by British forces in the war, or indeed in modern British history, with 130,000 personnel becoming prisoners of the Japanese. Included in this total were 15,000 Australians, so that the impact of the defeat and its consequences for this country were hardly less serious.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-battle-of-singapore>What was the outcome of the Battle of Singapore?</h2>
<p>The Singapore allied forces made up of British, Indian and Australian troops could not repel the Japanese invasion. The fall of Singapore ended on the 15 th of February and resulted in the capture of Singapore by the Japanese and the largest surrender of British led military men in history.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-singapore-important-in-world-war-2>Why was Singapore important in World War 2?</h2>
<p>During World War II, Singapore served as a major British naval base. Because they were British colonies, both Australia and India supplied troops to the British army, and many of them served in the Pacific and were stationed in Singapore.</p>
