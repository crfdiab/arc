<h2 id=what-happens-when-a-pumpkin-decomposes>What happens when a pumpkin decomposes?</h2>
<p>Decomposition is nature’s way of recycling nutrients. Exposure to the elements begins to break down the pumpkin’s cells and eventually decomposers like worms and other invertebrates, mold and bacteria go to work breaking the pumpkin down until eventually it turns into compost.</p>
<h2 id=do-rotting-pumpkins-in-landfills-release-harmful-gases>Do rotting pumpkins in landfills release harmful gases?</h2>
<p>If tossed into the trash, a rotting pumpkin will decompose like any other food waste and emit methane, a harmful greenhouse gas.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-pumpkins-help-the-environment>How do pumpkins help the environment?</h2>
<p>Pumpkins are 90% water and add tons of water to the landfills, contributing to the problem of groundwater contamination. As pumpkins break down, they create methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas that is more powerful than carbon dioxide (CO2).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-pumpkins-impact-the-world>How did pumpkins impact the world?</h2>
<p>Pumpkins have had a very positive effect on the world. They enhance our cultural holidays, provide a delicious and healthy food choice, provide nutrients and health benefits, improve lives in third-world countries, and boost the economy. They were a major benefit in the Columbian Exchange!</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-pumpkin-take-to-decompose>How long does pumpkin take to decompose?</h2>
<p>Once carved, pumpkins will generally only hold up for three to five days — or up to two weeks if you live in a colder climate — before wilting and showing signs of decay. And that’s not very long when you’ve worked so hard on your masterpiece.</p>
<h2 id=can-pumpkins-decompose>Can pumpkins decompose?</h2>
<p>Pumpkins left in the field will decompose leaving seeds that can sprout and grow into a new pumpkin plant the following year, continuing the pumpkin’s life cycle.</p>
<h2 id=are-pumpkins-bad-for-landfills>Are pumpkins bad for landfills?</h2>
<p>It’s not just food waste that concerns scientists. According to the US Department of Energy, pumpkins that end up in landfill will decompose and eventually emit methane – a greenhouse gas with more than 20 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-pumpkins-are-wasted>How many pumpkins are wasted?</h2>
<p>That’s a lot of food waste. The pumpkin waste amounts to about 18,000 tons of pumpkin, including flesh and seeds. The research was done by Hubbub and Knorr.</p>
<h2 id=are-pumpkins-a-waste>Are pumpkins a waste?</h2>
<p>That’s a lot of food waste. The pumpkin waste amounts to about 18,000 tons of pumpkin, including flesh and seeds. The research was done by Hubbub and Knorr. Their joint research found that 40% of UK consumers buy pumpkins to carve, but 60% report they do not use the pumpkin after carving and instead throw it out.</p>
<h2 id=is-halloween-bad-for-the-environment>Is Halloween bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>Based on a previous Hubbub report revealing that 7 million costumes are thrown out in the UK each year, that works out to 2,079 tons of plastic waste generated every Halloween — the equivalent of dumping 83 million Coca-Cola bottles into the ocean. …</p>

<h2 id=do-pumpkins-attract-rodents>Do pumpkins attract rodents?</h2>
<p>Rodents. Rodents such as mice and rats enjoy nibbling on pumpkins, especially if they’re cut open to reveal the soft and delicious fruit. Outdoor pumpkin decorations lure rodents close to your home, which increases the risk of an infestation on your property.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-a-carved-pumpkin-to-rot>How long does it take for a carved pumpkin to rot?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately for homeowners, though, carved pumpkins will often last between just one to two weeks before starting to rot. A rotting pumpkin can attract unwanted pests, like fruit flies, if left out too long. There are a few tricks, however, to keep pumpkins from rotting. Find out why pumpkins rot and how you can decelerate the rotting process.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-my-pumpkins-rotting-before-i-pick-them>Why are my Pumpkins rotting before I pick them?</h2>
<p>An abundance of fruit can equal a rich harvest of pumpkins, but often, the pumpkins rot before they are ready to pick. Rot is usually caused by excess soil moisture, which is a breeding ground for fungal maladies. Adopt a few tricks to help prevent your pumpkins from rotting and your harvest should be plentiful.</p>
