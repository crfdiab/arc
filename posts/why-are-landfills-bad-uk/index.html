<h2 id=why-are-landfills-bad-uk>Why are landfills bad UK?</h2>
<p>The three main problems with landfill are toxins, leachate and greenhouse gases. Organic waste produces bacteria which break the rubbish down. The decaying rubbish produces weak acidic chemicals which combine with liquids in the waste to form leachate and landfill gas.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-problems-caused-by-landfill-sites>What are the problems caused by landfill sites?</h2>
<p>The three most important problems with landfill are toxins, leachate and greenhouse gases.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-problems-with-waste-disposal-in-the-uk>Are there any problems with waste disposal in the UK?</h2>
<p>Each year approximately 111 million tonnes, or 57%, of all UK of controlled waste (household, commercial and industrial waste) are disposed of in landfill sites. However, some countries do not have significant amounts of suitable land and so landfilling is scarce.</p>
<h2 id=will-uk-run-out-of-landfill>Will UK run out of landfill?</h2>
<p>Britain will today be declared the “dustbin of Europe” after warnings that it will run out of landfill sites in less than eight years. The UK buries more than 18.8 million tonnes of household waste – two million tonnes more than any other EU country.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-all-our-waste-go-uk>Where does all our waste go UK?</h2>
<p>After recycling, the most common destination for the UK’s rubbish is landfill, with 24% of waste sent there in 2016. In England, the amount of waste sent for incineration has been increasing, up from 10.1 to 10.8 million tonnes in 2017-18.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-uk-do-with-garbage>What does the UK do with garbage?</h2>
<p>The main and most common method of disposal in the United Kingdom is landfill. Other methods are also used such as Incineration and anaerobic digestion. Out of all of the waste that was from household, commercial and industrial waste, approximately 57% of the waste was disposed in landfill sites.</p>
<h2 id=can-we-run-out-of-landfill>Can we run out of landfill?</h2>
<p>In fact, the US is on pace to run out of room in landfills within 18 years, potentially creating an environmental disaster, the report argues. The Northeast is running out of landfills the fastest, while Western states have the most remaining space, according to the report.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-uk-running-out-of-landfill-space>Is the UK running out of landfill space?</h2>
<p>But it can’t be opened up for landfill again. Which is potentially a big problem since the government has predicted that the UK will run out of landfill space by 2018. It’s startlingly close.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-landfills-bad-for-the-environment-and-people>Why are landfills bad for the environment and people?</h2>
<p>The decaying rubbish produces weak acidic chemicals which combine with liquids in the waste to form leachate and landfill gas. There are some secondary side effects as well: nauseous odors, unpleasant views, rat and seagull infestations, which create their own waste problems.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-waste-go-when-it-goes-to-a-landfill>Where does waste go when it goes to a landfill?</h2>
<p>Any waste that is not recycled or reused has to go somewhere, and it usually ends up at a landfill site. Landfill sites can be created from a void made by quarrying or may form part of a land reclamation scheme. Landfill sites exist all over the UK, and all over the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-uk-need-to-reduce-the-amount-of-rubbish-sent-to-landfill>Why does the UK need to reduce the amount of rubbish sent to landfill?</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the UK needs to dramatically reduce the amount of rubbish sent to landfill sites, as regardless of when space runs out, it is very much a finite resource. It also needs to increase efforts to clear existing sites up, as the pollution caused by them is unacceptable.</p>
