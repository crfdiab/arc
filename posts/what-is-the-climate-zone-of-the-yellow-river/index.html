<h2 id=what-is-the-climate-zone-of-the-yellow-river>What is the climate zone of the Yellow River?</h2>
<p>Yellow River Delta is in the temperate zone, with a characteristic monsoon climate (Table 1; Sun and Zhang 2006).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-coordinates-of-the-huang-he-river>What are the coordinates of the Huang He river?</h2>
<table><tr><th>Yellow River</th></tr><tr><td>• coordinates</td><td>34°29′31″N 96°20′25″E</td></tr><tr><td>• elevation</td><td>4,800 m (15,700 ft)</td></tr><tr><td>Mouth</td><td>Bohai Sea</td></tr><tr><td>• location</td><td>Kenli District, Dongying, Shandong</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relative-location-of-the-yellow-river>What is the relative location of the Yellow River?</h2>
<p>The river rises in southern Qinghai province on the Plateau of Tibet and crosses six other provinces and two autonomous regions in its course to the Bo Hai (Gulf of Chihli), an embayment of the Yellow Sea of the North Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-temperature-of-the-yellow-river>What is the temperature of the Yellow River?</h2>
<p>Air temperatures range from 50 to 82 °F (10 to 28 °C) and precipitation from about 20 inches (500 mm) in the north to 40 inches (1,000 mm) in the south. Sea fog is frequent along the coasts, especially in the upwelling cold-water areas.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-yellow-river-start-and-end>Where does the Yellow River start and end?</h2>
<p>The Yellow River originates at an elevation above 15,000 feet (4,600 metres) in the Bayan Har Mountains, in the eastern Plateau of Tibet. In its upper reaches the river crosses two large bodies of water, Lakes Ngoring and Gyaring.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-yellow-river-in-china>How tall is the Yellow River in China?</h2>
<p>The Yellow River then turns sharply to the south and flows for about 445 miles (715 km), forming the border between Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces. The river’s width usually does not exceed 150 to 200 feet (45 to 60 metres) in that section, as it cuts through narrow gorges with steep slopes several hundred feet (above 100 metres) in height.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-sediment-does-the-yellow-river-carry>What kind of sediment does the Yellow River carry?</h2>
<p>China’s Yellow River, or Huang He, travels through soft plateaus of silt, picking up a massive sediment load on its journey. The sediment carried by the river has reshaped China’s coast, adding several hundred square kilometers of land. Image of the Day for Jan</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-dam-on-the-yellow-river>Where is the dam on the Yellow River?</h2>
<p>Flood-control dam on the Yellow River (Huang He) at Zhengzhou, Henan province, China. As modern economic development has increased throughout the basin, however, pollution from industrial sources and agricultural runoff has also increased.</p>
