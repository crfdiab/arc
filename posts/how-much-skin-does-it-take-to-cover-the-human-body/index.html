<h2 id=how-many-feet-of-skin-do-you-have-all-over-your-body>How many feet of skin do you have all over your body?</h2>
<p>The skin is the largest organ of the body, with a total area of about 20 square feet. The skin protects us from microbes and the elements, helps regulate body temperature, and permits the sensations of touch, heat, and cold.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-7-layers-of-skin>Are there 7 layers of skin?</h2>
<p>There are seven layers of skin and each layer serves different functions. The skin is the largest organ in the body and it covers the body’s entire external surface. It is made up of seven layers ([starting from the top layer down to the bottom [deepest] layer):</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-7-skin-method>What is the 7 skin method?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-the-thickest-layer-of-skin>What is the thickest layer of skin?</h2>
<p>epidermis<br>
The squamous cell layer is the thickest layer of the epidermis, and is involved in the transfer of certain substances in and out of the body. The squamous cell layer also contains cells called Langerhans cells.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-skin-held-together>How is skin held together?</h2>
<p>The dermis is held together by a protein called collagen, made by fibroblasts. In the skin, collagen supports the epidermis, lending it its durability. Elastin, a similar protein, is the substance that allows the skin to spring back into place when stretched and keeps the skin flexible.</p>
