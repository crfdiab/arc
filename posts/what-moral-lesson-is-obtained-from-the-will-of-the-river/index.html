<h2 id=what-moral-lesson-is-obtained-from-the-will-of-the-river>What moral lesson is obtained from the will of the river?</h2>
<p>Another lesson taught by the dear river Bacong is that determination only is not enough. People need determination with aspiration towards their goal to truly have their hands placed on places they would like to reach.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-the-will-of-the-river>What is the meaning of the will of the river?</h2>
<p>The will of the River Analysis That river is likened to a persons life. First, it talks about the obstacles that the river. encounters as it flows towards the ocean. Second it speaks of the determination of the. river to reach its end which is again the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-river-of-life-in-the-bible>What is the river of Life in the Bible?</h2>
<p>The river of life flows from the Lamb on the throne. Jesus is the source of the river of life. Also the tree of life that was planted in the garden of Eden is mentioned as being planted in the city of the new Jerusalem. In this place, God’s people will see Him face to face.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-the-river-in-the-will-of-the-river>What is the purpose of the river in the will of the river?</h2>
<p>It is to furnish safe running water for plant and fish and fowl and for man and beast. The river is not there just to flow on and enjoy itself. The river must play its part in the processes of nature; to live, in other words, for the rest of creation. 12 And so it should be with the life of man.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-will-of-the-river-get-its-name>How did the will of the river get its name?</h2>
<p>Bacong is the river’s name situated by the ancestral homes of the author’s wife. He had been visiting the place for a dozen of summers and as always been tracing the course of the river back to it’s course. In one of his visits however, the author had noticed a certain significant thing that made him connect the river’s course to the life of men.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-river-worth-begin-and-end>Where does the River Worth begin and end?</h2>
<p>From the reservoir, the river flows east into Ponden Reservoir into the town of Haworth where it is joined by Bridgehouse Beck. It then flows east north-east through the suburbs of Keighley into the town centre where North Beck flows into it, it then continues down towards Stockbridge where it joins the River Aire.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-will-of-the-river>What happens at the end of the will of the river?</h2>
<p>This manner of running its course, the author regarded the life of people who have overcome the obstacles and the hindrances int heir lives and come out victorious either in glory or in nobility of silent and patient eking out to the end.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-river-worth-a-tributary-of-the-river-aire>Is the river worth a tributary of the River Aire?</h2>
<p>The River Worth is itself a tributary of the River Aire, which it joins at the end of the Worth Valley in Keighley . There are many small streams that feed Watersheddles Reservoir (yards over the border in Lancashire) from which the River Worth is fed.</p>
