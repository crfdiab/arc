<h2 id=why-was-malaya-colonized>Why was Malaya colonized?</h2>
<p>From the 15th century onwards, the Portuguese started seeking a maritime route towards Asia. In 1511, Afonso de Albuquerque led an expedition to Malaya which seized Malacca with the intent of using it as a base for activities in southeast Asia. This was the first colonial claim on what is now Malaysia.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-british-colonized-malaysia>When did British colonized Malaysia?</h2>
<p>The British formally made Malaysia a colony in 1867. The Federated Malay States, in southern Malaya, was formed in 1895 after the British intervened in the fratricidal wars of the sultans.</p>
<h2 id=what-primary-factor-factors-contributed-to-the-western-colonization-in-malaysia>What primary factor factors contributed to the western colonization in Malaysia?</h2>
<p>Following the British founding of Singapore in 1819, Chinese and British economic involvement on the Malay Peninsula expanded because of the lure of profits from tin mines and plantation agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-british-colonize-malaysia>Did the British colonize Malaysia?</h2>
<p>After that, Malaya fell into the hands of the Dutch in 1641 and British in 1824 through the Anglo–Dutch Treaty. British colonization was the longest compared to others. The British had integrated all the Malayan administration which was previously managed by the Malay Rulers with the help of state dignitaries.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-singapore-officially-became-a-part-of-malaysia>When did Singapore officially became a part of Malaysia?</h2>
<p>Malaysia – constituting the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak – was officially formed on 16 September 1963. Singapore became part of Malaysia with the signing of the Proclamation (in English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil) by the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, on behalf of the people of Singapore.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-british-first-settle-in-malaysia>When did the British first settle in Malaysia?</h2>
<p>The year 1786 saw the arrival of the British in Malaysia as Captain Francis Light established a settlement in Penang. Rapid development followed to make a free port to compete with Dutch Melaka. A few decades later, it became British Malaya’s most important port for tin and rubber exports.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-british-colonialism-affect-the-economy-of-malaysia>How did British colonialism affect the economy of Malaysia?</h2>
<p>We will write a custom Essay on British Colonialism in Malaysia and its Effects on Modern Malaysia specifically for you! During the initial years of the 20 th century while there was economic growth in Malaya, the Chinese flocked in Malaya to look for jobs and also to live there.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-bring-tin-to-malaysia>Why did the British bring tin to Malaysia?</h2>
<p>The Brits brought rubber trees from Brazil in the late 19th-century. Industrialising Europe needed rubber to meet the ever increasing demand in the automotive business. The British responded with a rubber boom in the early 20th-century. People have mined tin in Perak for thousands of years.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-dutch-want-to-colonize-malaysia>Why did the Dutch want to colonize Malaysia?</h2>
<p>The Portuguese had a monopoly on the spice trade due to their fortress in the Strait, so this was a target for the rising Dutch Empire, in an alliance with the Sultanate of Johor they gained control in 1641.</p>
