<h2 id=why-did-the-british-want-to-fight-the-french>Why did the British want to fight the French?</h2>
<p>However, the main British war aim was to destroy France as a commercial rival, and they therefore focused on attacking the French navy and colonies overseas. France was committed to fighting in Europe to defend its ally, Austria. It therefore had few resources to spare for its colonies.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-french-and-british-want-control-of-the-land>Why did the French and British want control of the land?</h2>
<p>The French wanted to control the American Indian trade in the Ohio River Valley and keep the Pennsylvania traders out. They also needed the American Indians living there to be their allies. His job was to keep control of the Ohio River – and to keep the British out.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-british-gain-from-the-french>What did the British gain from the French?</h2>
<p>British forces seized French Caribbean islands, Spanish Cuba, and the Philippines. In the resulting Treaty of Paris (1763), Great Britain secured significant territorial gains, including all French territory east of the Mississippi river, as well as Spanish Florida, although the treaty returned Cuba to Spain.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-english-lose-control-of-france>Why did the English lose control of France?</h2>
<p>French was spoken and learned by anyone in the upper classes; however, it became less useful as English lost its control of various places in France (where the peasants spoke French, too). After that — roughly, 1450 — English was simply more useful for talking to anybody.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-english-supplant-the-french-in-normandy>Why did the English supplant the French in Normandy?</h2>
<p>In reality it took until the 14th c. for English to slowly supplant French in many of these domains. There are several reasons for this: John Lackland (King of England) lost Normandy to the King of France. This meant that his and the Norman aristocracy’s focus shifted to England.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-english-gain-control-of-the-dutch-and-french-colonies>How did the English gain control of the Dutch and French colonies?</h2>
<p>Expert Answers. The English fought a series of wars against the French that involved fighting in North America. Finally, in the Seven Years’ War (known in US history as the French and Indian War), the English defeated France completely and forced France to withdraw from North America. In this way, the English took the French and the Dutch colonies.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-english-claim-to-be-king-of-france>Why did the English claim to be king of France?</h2>
<p>The decision to assume the title of “King of France” was made at the solicitation of his Flemish allies, who had signed a treaty that they would no longer attack the French king.</p>
