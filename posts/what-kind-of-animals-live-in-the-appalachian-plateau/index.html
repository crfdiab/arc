<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-live-in-the-appalachian-plateau>What kind of animals live in the Appalachian plateau?</h2>
<p>Throughout all of the Appalachian Plateau region there is an abundance of fox, raccoon, wild boar, black bears, white-tailed deer, and beaver. Researchers also found there to be over 200 species of game and song birds including wild turkey, heron, geese, hawks, ducks and many more.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-grown-in-the-appalachian-region>What is grown in the Appalachian region?</h2>
<p>Farming: Many parts of the Appalachian region are mountainous and rocky while others have flat fertile lands. Many of the crops grown in this region include fruits, berries, grain, and potatoes. They are grown mostly in the Annapolis Valley.</p>
<h2 id=do-wolves-live-in-the-appalachian-mountains>Do wolves live in the Appalachian Mountains?</h2>
<p>Ferns, mosses, and mushrooms of many species also are part of the complex Appalachian plant life. Bison, elk, and wolves, once common to the Appalachians, disappeared long ago, although elk subsequently have returned to the northern mountains; caribou and moose are still found in the northernmost corners of the region.</p>
<h2 id=do-foxes-live-in-the-appalachian-plateau>Do foxes live in the Appalachian plateau?</h2>
<p>The wildlife a person might encounter in the Appalachian Mountains includes a wide variety of animals: Mammals (moose, white-tailed deer, black bears, beaver, chipmunks, rabbits, squirrels, foxes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, groundhogs, porcupines, bats, weasels, shrews, and minks)</p>
<h2 id=are-there-wolves-in-the-appalachian-mountains>Are there wolves in the Appalachian Mountains?</h2>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-coyote-and-a-wolf>What is the difference between a coyote and a wolf?</h2>
<p>A gray wolf is much larger than a coyote. Wolves weigh 80 to 120 pounds, while coyotes weigh 20 to 50 pounds. Ear shape is also much different; wolves have somewhat rounded ears while coyotes have taller, pointed ears. Wolves have a broader, shorter snout, while coyotes have a narrow more pointed nose.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-live-in-the-appalachian-mountains>What kind of animals live in the Appalachian Mountains?</h2>
<p>Appalachian wildlife includes mammals such as white-tailed deer, moose, beavers, skunks, porcupines and weasels, as well as birds, including flycatchers, wrens, warblers and hawks. Amphibians and reptiles, including salamanders, frogs, turtles, copperheads and rattlesnakes, also call the Appalachians home.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-trees-grow-in-the-appalachian-mountains>What kind of trees grow in the Appalachian Mountains?</h2>
<p>Rhododendron, azalea, and mountain laurel are among those producing flowers. A multitude of tree species includes red spruce, balsam fir, sugar maple, buckeye, beech, ash, birch, red oak, white oak, poplar, walnut, sycamore, yellow poplar, buckeye, eastern hemlock, and chestnut oak.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-species-of-plants-are-in-the-appalachian-corridor>How many species of plants are in the Appalachian Corridor?</h2>
<p>Over 1,000 species of plants occur naturally on Appalachian Corridor territory. Despite its great diversity, the flora in the region is still relatively unknown in some sectors of the mountains or other areas difficult to access and that have not yet been explored.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-adaptations-of-the-appalachian-mountains>What are the adaptations of the Appalachian Mountains?</h2>
<p>Adaptations: They have a keen sense of smell. They are excellent hunters. Beavers are nocturnal animals. They spend a lot of time in the water, so they are considered semi-aquatic. Adaptations: Water-proof coat, very sharp teeth, and a very flat and wide tail. Only male Elk have antlers.</p>
