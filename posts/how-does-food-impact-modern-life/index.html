<h2 id=how-does-food-impact-modern-life>How does food impact modern life?</h2>
<p>If we get too much food, or food that gives our bodies the wrong instructions, we can become overweight, undernourished, and at risk for the development of diseases and conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease. In short, what we eat is central to our health.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-food-so-important-to-indians>Why is food so important to Indians?</h2>
<p>For many Indians, “sitting down” with their family for a meal is one of the most important activities of the day. As a country we firmly believe that the family that eats together stays together, and meal time is a strong source of family bonding, talking and sharing. Everyone eats a bit of everything.</p>
<h2 id=which-factors-are-affecting-food-in-india>Which factors are affecting food in India?</h2>
<p>The choice of food is influenced by a wide range of complex and often interrelated factors, such as social, economic, cultural, political, and environmental factors (Señoran, Ibánez, & Cifuentes, 2003).</p>
<h2 id=how-does-modern-life-style-and-food-affect-us>How does modern life style and food affect us?</h2>
<p>In term of the relationship between modern diet and health, the following four key problems have to be addressed: (I) Under-nutrition causes nutrition deficiency, and over nutrition leads to obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and cancer.</p>
<h2 id=why-modern-diet-is-bad>Why modern diet is bad?</h2>
<p>The studies show that the brain doesn’t “register” liquid sugar calories the in the same way as calories from solid foods, which dramatically increases total calorie intake (12, 13). One study found that in children, each daily serving of sugar-sweetened beverages is linked to a 60% increased risk of obesity (14).</p>
<h2 id=why-indian-food-is-so-unhealthy>Why Indian food is so unhealthy?</h2>
<p>Food served in a restaurant, or when prepared for special occasions, can be fattening and unhealthy since health is compromised in the interest of taste. In order to make it tastier than normal, many ingredients are used in excess—oil, butter, cream, sugar, and so on.</p>

<h2 id=why-does-india-have-different-food-habits-and-clothing>Why does India have different food habits and clothing?</h2>
<p>We have different types of food and clothing in India due to differences in geography and climate in different parts of India. In the east and south India, rice is the main food due to the soil and climate. Some parts of India are very hot while other parts are cold. For example, South India is hot.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-eat-poor-quality-food>Why do we eat poor quality food?</h2>
<p>What Causes Poor Nutrition? Poor eating habits include under- or over-eating, not having enough of the healthy foods we need each day, or consuming too many types of food and drink, which are low in fibre or high in fat, salt and/or sugar.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-future-for-modern-indian-cuisine>Is there a future for modern Indian cuisine?</h2>
<p>With modern Indian cuisine growing in prominence, more chefs are optimistic that Indian food can make its mark on the world’s dining landscape. Arora is confident that Indian cuisine can be the future of modern cuisine in Asia. She draws parallels from her working experience at two-starred noma in Copenhagen.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-peoples-eating-habits-changing-in-india>Why are people’s eating habits changing in India?</h2>
<p>For the average Indian, this has certainly been the case. Factors such as income, food prices, individual preferences and beliefs, cultural traditions, as well as geographical, environmental, social and economic factors have all influenced changes in diet, both on an individual and on a national level.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-indian-cuisine-so-important-to-asia>Why is Indian cuisine so important to Asia?</h2>
<p>Indian cuisine is so steeped in history and most cuisines in Asia can be traced back to India. Indian cuisine can equip chefs with the tools and resources to make something completely new and modern. What French food did for the development of Nordic dining scene, Indian food can do the same for Asia.”</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-diverse-food-in-india>Which is the most diverse food in India?</h2>
<p>Not only is Indian food diverse but also changes every 10 kilometres. Enriched with different varieties of dals, subzis, rotis, rice and an infinite category of fruits, Indian cuisine is colourful in every aspect. According to our ancient Indian science, Ayurveda, Indian food is complete and enough for our bodies.</p>
