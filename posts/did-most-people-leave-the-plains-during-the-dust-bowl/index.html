<h2 id=did-most-people-leave-the-plains-during-the-dust-bowl>Did most people leave the Plains during the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>The Dust Bowl exodus was the largest migration in American history within a short period of time. Between 1930 and 1940, approximately 3.5 million people moved out of the Plains states; of those, it is unknown how many moved to California. In just over a year, over 86,000 people migrated to California.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-so-many-families-migrate-from-the-great-plains-during-the-dust-bowl-era>Why did so many families migrate from the Great Plains during the Dust Bowl era?</h2>
<p>Why did so many families migrate from the Great Plains during the Dust Bowl era? City populations grew as farmers left their homes on the Great Plains in search of urban work. What happened to some Mexican Americans during the Great Depression? Government repatriation efforts forced them to return to Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-leave-the-plains-during-the-dust-bowl>Why did people leave the plains during the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>During the 1930s, some 2.5 million people left the Plains states. The Modesto Bee on September 30, 2008 reviewed Dust Bowl migration to California. A series of wet years in the 1920s led farmers to believe that the Plains could sustain annual plowing to produce wheat. Drought in the 1930s allowed dust storms to carry away top soil.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-dust-bowl-hit-in-the-1930s>Where did the Dust Bowl hit in the 1930s?</h2>
<p>In the 1930s, a series of severe dust storms swept across the mid-west states of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and Texas. The storms, years of drought, and the Great Depression devastated the lives of residents living in those Dust Bowl states.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-refugees-from-the-dust-bowl-come-from>Where did the refugees from the Dust Bowl come from?</h2>
<p>But those refugees weren’t from other countries, they were Americans and former inhabitants of the Great Plains and the Midwest who had lost their homes and livelihoods in the Dust Bowl. Years of severe drought had ravaged millions of acres of farmland.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-nasa-explain-the-dust-bowl-drought>How did NASA explain the Dust Bowl drought?</h2>
<p>NASA EXPLAINS “DUST BOWL” DROUGHT. NASA scientists have an explanation for one of the worst climatic events in the history of the United States, the “Dust Bowl” drought, which devastated the Great Plains and all but dried up an already depressed American economy in the 1930’s.</p>
