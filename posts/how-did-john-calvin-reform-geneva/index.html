<h2 id=how-did-john-calvin-reform-geneva>How did John Calvin Reform Geneva?</h2>
<p>He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and in 1541 he was invited back to lead the church of the city. Following his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and liturgy, despite opposition from several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-john-calvins-reforms>What were John Calvin’s reforms?</h2>
<p>John Calvin is known for his influential Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536), which was the first systematic theological treatise of the reform movement. He stressed the doctrine of predestination, and his interpretations of Christian teachings, known as Calvinism, are characteristic of Reformed churches.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-calvinists-implement-in-geneva>What did Calvinists implement in Geneva?</h2>
<p>What did Calvinists implement in Geneva? They imposed strict penalties for blasphemy and immoral behavior.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-john-calvin-discuss-the-reformation-movement-in-switzerland>Who was the John Calvin discuss the reformation movement in Switzerland?</h2>
<p>The Reformation in Switzerland involved various centres and reformers. A major role was played by Ulrich Zwingli, who was active from 1523 in Zurich, and John Calvin, who from 1536 transformed Geneva into what was called the “Protestant Rome”.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-john-calvin-disagree-with-the-catholic-church>Why did John Calvin disagree with the Catholic Church?</h2>
<p>They thought the Church had gotten too far away from the Bible as the source of truth and that the priests and the Pope were abusing their power. As he thought about religion more, Calvin started disagreeing with Roman Catholic teachings. In 1536, Calvin published a book titled Institutes of the Christian Religion.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-protestants-want-to-break-from-the-catholic-church>Why did the Protestants want to break from the Catholic Church?</h2>
<p>Because of corruption in the Catholic Church, some people saw that the way it worked needed to change. People like Erasmus, Huldrych Zwingli, Martin Luther and John Calvin saw the corruption and tried to stop it. This led to a split in the church, into Catholics and various Protestant churches.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-john-calvin-help-the-geneva-reform>How did John Calvin help the Geneva reform?</h2>
<p>Farel pressed Calvin to come and help the Genevan reform. Geneva was to be Calvin’s home until he died in 1564 (except for a three-year period when he was exiled from there, only to be invited back to leadership). While there, his workload was staggering. Calvin pastored the St. Pierre church, preaching in it daily.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-reformation-in-switzerland>Who was involved in the Reformation in Switzerland?</h2>
<p>The Reformation in Switzerland involved various centres and reformers. A major role was played by Ulrich Zwingli, who was active from 1523 in Zurich, and John Calvin, who from 1536 transformed Geneva into what was called the “Protestant Rome”. Ulrich Zwingli came from a rich Toggenburg (eastern Switzerland) farming family.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-jean-calvin-and-what-did-he-do>Who was Jean Calvin and what did he do?</h2>
<p>Zwingli died in 1531 in a fight against Catholic soldiers from central Switzerland. Jean Calvin was a Frenchman who came to Geneva in 1536 for the first time after he had broken with the Roman Catholic Church. Geneva at the time was not yet part of the Confederation, but had close relations with Bern and Zurich.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-john-calvin-lead-the-reformed-church>Where did John Calvin lead the Reformed Church?</h2>
<p>Calvin’s theology imported better than many other brands of Protestantism. It found a home in places as far apart as Scotland, Poland, Holland, and America. His spiritual descendants make up the World Alliance of Reformed Churches based in Calvin’s Geneva.</p>
