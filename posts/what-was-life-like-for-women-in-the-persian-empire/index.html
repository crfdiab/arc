<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-women-in-the-persian-empire>What was life like for women in the Persian Empire?</h2>
<p>Women in ancient Persia were not only highly respected but, in many cases, considered the equals of males. Women could own land, conduct business, received equal pay, could travel freely on their own, and in the case of royal women, hold their own council meetings on policy.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-persian-culture-different-from-the-greeks>How was the Persian culture different from the Greeks?</h2>
<p>Greece was made up of independent city-states who had different types of government. Sparta was ruled by an oligarchy whereas Athens was a democracy. Persians had the king, aristocrats, and free citizens.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-non-royal-women-identified-in-ancient-persia>How were non royal women identified in ancient Persia?</h2>
<p>Some women had economic independence, owning and directing their own estates. Non-royal women were identified by their job and job rank. The highest ranking female workers were called arashshara. Women workers received the same wages and rations as men during the Achaemenid Empire.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-the-persian-empire>What was life like in the Persian Empire?</h2>
<p>You would find people in a number of different occupations like merchants, soldiers, government workers, dress and costume makers, school teachers, and craftsmen, just to name a few. You and your family may have lived a nomadic lifestyle, requiring you to move from place to place rather than live in one area for long.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-ancient-persian-people>Who were the ancient Persian people?</h2>
<p>The Persian Empire started as a collection of semi-nomadic tribes who raised sheep, goats and cattle on the Iranian plateau. Cyrus the Great—the leader of one such tribe—began to defeat nearby kingdoms, including Media, Lydia and Babylon, joining them under one rule.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-womens-rights-in-ancient-greece>What were women’s rights in ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>Women in the ancient Greek world had few rights in comparison to male citizens. Unable to vote, own land, or inherit, a woman’s place was in the home and her purpose in life was the rearing of children. For example, they had to do physical training like men, were permitted to own land, and could drink wine.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-greatest-persian-warrior>Who was the greatest Persian warrior?</h2>
<p>Cyrus the Great, also called Cyrus II, (born 590–580 bce, Media, or Persis [now in Iran]—died c. 529, Asia), conqueror who founded the Achaemenian empire, centred on Persia and comprising the Near East from the Aegean Sea eastward to the Indus River.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-women-in-ancient-greece>What was life like for women in ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>The essay on “Lives of women in Ancient Greece and Rome” should cover the relationship between the men and women of ancient Greece, and the role of each. This is important as it will help the readers of the essay to understand the kind of life the women of Greece and Rome lived.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-place-of-women-in-ancient-persia>What was the place of women in ancient Persia?</h2>
<p>Based on historical evidence, the place of women in ancient Iran was much better in comparison with other countries. When women in ancient Greece, were not regarded even as citizens, in ancient Iran we have cases like Homay (a female ruler / queen) and female Gordafarid (a female general and heroine) battles regarded as part of the history.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-society-so-patriarchal-in-ancient-persia>Why was society so patriarchal in ancient Persia?</h2>
<p>However, Ancient Persian society was still patriarchal, and for the most part, men held higher positions than women. One of the reasons that Ancient Persians held women in high regard might have been their religion.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-the-persians-and-the-greeks>What was the relationship between the Persians and the Greeks?</h2>
<p>It wasn’t the most historically accurate film, to say the least, but it did indeed show the strange relationship between the Persians and the Greeks quite well. Because of this animosity, Greek sources often referred to Persian women as conniving or manipulative figures who took advantage of weak kings. But what were they really like?</p>
