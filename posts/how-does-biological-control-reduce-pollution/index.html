<h2 id=how-does-biological-control-reduce-pollution>How does biological control reduce pollution?</h2>
<p>Biological control systems can be used to remove gaseous pollutants from a process stream by aerobic digestion or consumption by microbes. Biological systems can be effective on certain VOC species and some inorganic compounds. Biotrickling filters – more complicated systems which can use nutrient and pH dosing.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-biological-pollution>What is the meaning of biological pollution?</h2>
<p>Biological pollutants are substances in our environment which come from living organisms and can affect our health. They includethings such as pollen from trees and plants, insects or insect parts, certain fungi, some bacteria and viruses, and even animal hair, animal skin scales, saliva, and urine.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-biology-used-in-environmental-science>How is biology used in environmental science?</h2>
<p>Moreover, biology plays a vital role in developing student’s positive feelings toward nature. Finally, it helps students develop environmental skills such as the ability to identify and define environmental problems, ability to analyze environmental problems, and the ability to solve environmental problems.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-remove-pollution>How can we remove pollution?</h2>
<p>10 Best Ways to Reduce Air Pollution</p>
<ol>
<li>Using public transports.</li>
<li>Turn off the lights when not in use.</li>
<li>Recycle and Reuse.</li>
<li>No to plastic bags.</li>
<li>Reduction of forest fires and smoking.</li>
<li>Use of fans instead of Air Conditioner.</li>
<li>Use filters for chimneys.</li>
<li>Avoid usage of crackers.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-does-biological-pollution-affect-humans>How does biological pollution affect humans?</h2>
<p>Health Effects From Biological Contaminants Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of health problems caused by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive problems.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-biological-pollution-example>What is biological pollution example?</h2>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust, mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Standing water, water-damaged materials or wet surfaces also serve as a breeding ground for molds, mildews, bacteria and insects.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-importance-of-pollution-control-important>Why is the importance of pollution control important?</h2>
<p>Importance Of Pollution Control Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into a natural environment that causes instability, disorder, harm or discomfort to the ecosystem i.e. physical systems or living organisms. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat, or light.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-biological-methods-used-to-control-pollution>How are biological methods used to control pollution?</h2>
<p>Biological water pollution control methods are those which utilize biological activity to remove pollutants from water streams. These methods are used for the control of biodegradable organic chemicals, as well as nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-ways-to-control-air-pollution>What are some ways to control air pollution?</h2>
<p>Other air pollution control measures include: By minimizing and reducing the use of fire and fire products. Since industrial emissions are one of the major causes of air pollution, the pollutants can be controlled or treated at the source itself to reduce its effects. Fuel substitution is another way of controlling air pollution.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-air-pollution-affect-animals-and-plants>How does air pollution affect animals and plants?</h2>
<p>The air pollutants suspend on the water bodies and affect the aquatic life. Pollution also compels the animals to leave their habitat and shift to a new place. This renders them stray and has also led to the extinction of a large number of animal species.</p>
