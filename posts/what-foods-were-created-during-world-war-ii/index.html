<h2 id=how-much-food-did-the-uk-import-during-ww2>How much food did the UK import during ww2?</h2>
<p>At the start of the Second World War in 1939, the United Kingdom was importing 20,000,000 long tons of food per year, including about 70% of its cheese and sugar, nearly 80% of fruits and about 70% of cereals and fats.</p>
<h2 id=what-vegetable-did-british-cooks-substitute-for-bananas-during-world-war-ii>What vegetable did British cooks substitute for bananas during World War II?</h2>
<p>parsnips<br>
In fact, after World War II, when imported bananas were scarce in the UK, parsnips were often used as a substitute in baked goods. So there you have it. The humble parsnip might be just the thing to reach for if the banana apocalypse does come.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-rationed-in-uk-during-ww2>What was rationed in UK during ww2?</h2>
<p>When World War II began in September 1939, petrol was the first commodity to be controlled. On 8 January 1940, bacon, butter and sugar were rationed. Meat, tea, jam, biscuits, breakfast cereals, cheese, eggs, lard, milk, canned and dried fruit were rationed subsequently, though not all at once.</p>
<h2 id=what-vegetable-did-british-cooks-substitute>What vegetable did British cooks substitute?</h2>
<p>Mock Bananas<br>
To Cope With a Wartime Banana Ban, British Home Cooks Made ‘Mock Bananas’</p>
<h2 id=which-fruit-was-no-longer-imported-after-1940>Which fruit was no longer imported after 1940?</h2>
<p>Bananas are said to be the most popular fruit in the world today. During the war though, as imported perishables, they were impossible to get and most children did not see their first banana until after the war.</p>
<h2 id=what-foods-did-the-british-eat-before-world-war-2>What foods did the British eat before World War 2?</h2>
<p>In the 1930s, before the outbreak of the Second World War, the British population was somewhere between 46 million and 52 million. Britain imported 70% of its food; this required 20 million tons of shipping a year. 50% of meat was imported, 70% of cheese and sugar, 80% of fruits, 70% of cereals and fats, 91% of butter.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-did-people-get-dried-eggs-during-world-war-2>How often did people get dried eggs during World War 2?</h2>
<p>Dried eggs 1 packet every four weeks. In addition to the above food, everyone was allowed 16 points per month to use on what ever food items they wished. How did the government make sure people had enough food? People were encouraged to provide their own food at home.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-was-food-rationing-during-world-war-2>How long was food rationing during World War 2?</h2>
<p>Lawns and flower-beds were turned into vegetable gardens. Chickens, rabbits, goats and pigs were reared in town parks and gardens. Food rationing lasted for 14 years in Britain, from 1940 until 1954. Rationing continued even after the war ended:</p>
<h2 id=how-much-food-was-canned-during-world-war-2>How much food was canned during World War 2?</h2>
<p>The USDA estimates that approximately 4 billion cans and jars of food, both sweet and savory, were produced that year. Community canning centers aided in the process of reaching record levels of preserved food in the United States during the war. In 1945, the USDA stated that 6,000 canning centers were in operation throughout the United States.</p>
