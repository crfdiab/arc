<h2 id=what-describes-a-separation-of-religion-and-the-government>What describes a separation of religion and the government?</h2>
<p>The principle that government must maintain an attitude of neutrality toward religion. The First Amendment not only allows citizens the freedom to practice any religion of their choice, but also prevents the government from officially recognizing or favoring any religion.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-religion-and-government>What is it called when religion and government?</h2>
<p>Theocracy, government by divine guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided. In many theocracies, government leaders are members of the clergy, and the state’s legal system is based on religious law.</p>
<h2 id=what-separates-religion-from-state>What separates religion from state?</h2>
<p>Principle of separation of church and state is enshrined in Article 41 which states: All religious communities shall be equal before the law and clearly separated from the state.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-separation-of-the-church-and-state>What is meant by separation of the church and state?</h2>
<p>Paradoxically, nowadays, state control of religion only happens in communist states – but without the state support or patronage. Thus, the separation of the Church and state is to the advantage of the Church for it protects the Church from state control and interference.</p>
<h2 id=who-said-separation-of-church-and-state>Who said separation of church and state?</h2>
<p>Thomas Jefferson<br>
The most famous use of the metaphor was by Thomas Jefferson in his 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptist Association. In it, Jefferson declared that when the American people adopted the establishment clause they built a “wall of separation between the church and state.”</p>
<h2 id=who-believed-in-separation-of-church-and-state>Who believed in separation of church and state?</h2>
<p>Thomas Jefferson and James Madison believed that without separating church from state, there could be no real religious freedom. The first use of the “wall of separation” metaphor was by Roger Williams, who founded Rhode Island in 1635.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-religion-and-government>What is the relationship between religion and government?</h2>
<p>The First Amendment reads, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof…” This clearly and unambiguously states that the religious institutions must remain out of the government and vice versa.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-government-define-religion>How does the government define religion?</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court has interpreted religion to mean a sincere and meaningful belief that occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to the place held by God in the lives of other persons.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-separation-of-state-and-religion-is-necessary>Why the separation of state and religion is necessary?</h2>
<p>Religion is too important to be a government program or a political pageant. The concept of a “separation of church and state” reinforces the legal right of a free people to freely live their faith, even in public; without fear of government coercion. Free exercise means you may have a faith and you may live it.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-benefits-of-separation-of-church-and-state>What are the benefits of separation of church and state?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-the-origin-of-separation-of-church-and-state>What is the origin of separation of church and state?</h2>
<p>The expression “separation of church and state” can be traced to an 1802 letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote to a group of men affiliated with the Danbury Baptists Association of Connecticut. Jefferson introduced the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom in 1779, which became law in 1786.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-separation-of-church-and-state>Is there a separation of church and state?</h2>

<h2 id=when-did-the-separation-of-church-and-state-happen-in-france>When did the separation of church and state happen in France?</h2>
<p>The French version of separation of church and state, called laïcité, is a product of French history and philosophy. It was formalized in a 1905 law providing for the separation of church and state, that is, the separation of religion from political power.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-separation-between-religion-and-politics>Is there a separation between religion and politics?</h2>
<p>Islam is a total way of life that affects how Muslims think and behave whether they are in the mosque, the home, or the marketplace. Every area of human existence comes under the authority of Islam. Consequently, there is no separation between religion and politics in Islam.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-us-government-deal-with-religion>How does the US government deal with religion?</h2>
