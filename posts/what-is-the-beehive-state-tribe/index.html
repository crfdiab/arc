<h2 id=which-state-is-know-as-the-beehive-state>Which state is know as the Beehive State?</h2>
<p>Utah is referred to as the Beehive State due to the symbol of the beehive being associated with the state, including its use on the state flag. The beehive is considered to be synonymous with industry and perseverance, since bees are famously hard workers, toiling almost endlessly for the well being of the hive and the bees living within it.</p>
<h2 id=what-state-is-also-called-the-bee-hive-state>What state is also called the Bee Hive state?</h2>
<p>Utah is known as “The Beehive State,” and businesses continue to name themselves after the antique skep, many of them without knowing what a bee skep is, or where the bees are. But even without them knowing it, the beehive has become an everyday icon that links present-day Utahns-Mormons and non-Mormons- with their pioneer past.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-beehive-state-native-called>What is a beehive state native called?</h2>
<p>It could also come from the Native American tribe called the ‘Ute’, which means the people of the mountains. Utah’s nickname is the ‘Beehive State,’ but this is not because it has lots of beehives. Instead, the symbol of the beehive was chosen in 1848 because bees represent perseverance and industry.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-beehive-on-utahs-state-flag>Why is beehive on Utah’s State Flag?</h2>
<p>The beehive was adopted, in 1847, as an official emblem and represents the qualities of industry, perseverance, thrift, stability , and self-reliance , all virtues respected by the region’s settlers. The beehive is the centerpiece of the Utah State Flag and the Utah State Seal.</p>
