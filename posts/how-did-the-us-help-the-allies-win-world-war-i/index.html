<p>In addition to troops, the United States provided arms, tanks, ships, fuel and food to its friends. This aid helped the Allies win. You could say Stubby joined the Army in 1917.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-support-great-britain-in-ww2>How did the US support Great Britain in ww2?</h2>
<p>In mid-December 1940, Roosevelt introduced a new policy initiative whereby the United States would lend, rather than sell, military supplies to Great Britain for use in the fight against Germany. Payment for the supplies would be deferred, and could come in any form Roosevelt deemed satisfactory.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-win-ww2>How did the US win ww2?</h2>
<p>On September 2, World War II ended when U.S. General Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan’s formal surrender aboard the U.S. battleship Missouri, anchored in Tokyo Bay along with a flotilla of more than 250 Allied warships.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-help-great-britain-in-world-war-1>How did the US help Great Britain in World War 1?</h2>
<p>The U.S. enacted a Selective Service Act, and by Spring 1918 had enough soldiers in France to help England and France turn back a massive German offensive. In Fall 1918, under the command of General John J. “Blackjack” Pershing, American troops flanked the German lines while British and French troops held the German front in place.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-great-britain-an-ally-of-the-us>Why was Great Britain an ally of the US?</h2>
<p>Great Britain actively courted the United States—with its manpower and industrial might—to enter the war as an ally.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-in-favor-of-aid-to-britain>Who was in favor of aid to Britain?</h2>
<p>Though Franklin Roosevelt and his administration were strongly in favor of aid to Britain from the start, Roosevelt knew the political impossibility of getting ahead of public opinion. In a 1937 poll, 95 percent of Americans said they flatly opposed American entry into another world war under any circumstances.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-not-support-the-union>Why did the British not support the Union?</h2>
<p>As a result, many contemporary British commentators were uneasy about supporting the Union, including Charles Dickens who believed the war was caused by northern protectionism. However, the popular majority in Great Britain also objected to and was disturbed by southern support for slavery.</p>
