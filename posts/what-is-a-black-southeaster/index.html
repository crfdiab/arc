<p>However, if the South-Easter is accompanied by a cut-off low as occasionally happens in the spring and autumn months, this can cause heavy rains to fall over the Western Cape. This phenomenon is popularly known as a Black South-Easter.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-south-easter>What is meant by South Easter?</h2>
<p>1 : a strong southeast wind. 2 : a storm with southeast winds.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-the-south-easter-wind>What causes the South Easter wind?</h2>
<p>The air around High pressure moves counter-clockwise. Low pressure (below 1013 mb) is warm air that is rising. Air around the Low moves clockwise. Air moves from High pressure towards Low pressure (to replace the rising air) and this creates wind.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-cape-so-windy>Why is the Cape so windy?</h2>
<p>Between October and March, a south-easterly wind blows through Cape Town, clearing up the city’s air and taking the edge off the summer heat. It’s also responsible for the “tablecloth” effect that can sometimes be seen on Table Mountain. In some cases, the wind can reach speeds of up to 120km/h!</p>
<h2 id=why-are-winds-called-doctors>Why are winds called doctors?</h2>
<p>In West Africa it is known as ‘the doctor’ because of its invigorating dryness compared with humid tropical air. The harmattan wind stream occasionally extends south of the equator during the northern winter as an upper air wind over the south-westerly monsoon.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-the-cape-doctor>Why is it called the Cape Doctor?</h2>
<p>“Cape Doctor” is the local name for the strong, often persistent and dry south-easterly wind that blows on the South African coast from spring to late summer (September to March in the southern hemisphere). It is known as the Cape Doctor because of a local belief that it clears Cape Town of pollution and ‘pestilence’.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-wind-so-strong-in-cape-town>Why is the wind so strong in Cape Town?</h2>
<p>The strong wind is being caused by a pressure gradient between a low and high pressure system. “The tight pressure gradient between the high and low pressure systems along the coast is causing the high wind speed,” SAWS forecaster Kgolofelo Mahlangu told News24.</p>
