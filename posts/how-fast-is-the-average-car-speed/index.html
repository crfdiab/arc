<h2 id=how-fast-is-the-average-car-speed>How fast is the average car speed?</h2>
<p>The average modern car is limited to a top speed of around 120 mph, and the fastest can go about 200.</p>
<h2 id=how-fast-does-the-average-driver-drive>How fast does the average driver drive?</h2>
<p>On the other hand, Oklahoma posts just 44 billion miles each year (85 percent less than California), but each driver averages 17,700 miles, far more than the average American….Average miles driven per year in each state.</p>
<table><tr><th>State</th><th>Total Miles</th><th>Average Miles Per Driver</th></tr><tr><td>California</td><td>340 billion</td><td>12,524</td></tr><tr><td>Colorado</td><td>54 billion</td><td>12,899</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-fastest-a-human-can-drive>What is the fastest a human can drive?</h2>
<p>So far, the fastest anyone has run is about 27½ miles per hour, a speed reached (briefly) by sprinter Usain Bolt just after the midpoint of his world-record 100-meter dash in 2009. This speed limit probably is not imposed by the strength of our bones and tendons.</p>
<h2 id=how-fast-does-the-average-american-drive>How fast does the average American drive?</h2>
<p>13,474 miles per year<br>
Americans drive 13,474 miles per year on average. American males drive 16,550 miles per year, compared to the female average of just 10,412. 1.35 million people lost their lives and up to 50 million suffer injuries every year in road accidents worldwide. Speed-related crashes cost Americans $40.4 billion each year.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-drive-faster-or-slower>Is it safe to drive faster or slower?</h2>
<p>So yes, driving faster is safer than driving slower if conditions permit. For example, it is not a good idea to over speed in a residential area. In conclusion, you can drive faster but you need to be smart about it. You can drive fast or slow but you need to put safety as the first and foremost priority – always.</p>
<h2 id=how-fast-can-you-hit-a-speed-bump>How fast can you hit a speed bump?</h2>
<p>Ideally, you shouldn’t go faster than 5 mph when traveling over a speed bump. Any faster and you’ll likely experience a substantial jolt that can harm your tires—not to mention several other parts of your vehicle such as its shocks, steering, exhaust system, and bumpers.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-miles-does-the-average-person-drive-a-day>How many miles does the average person drive a day?</h2>
<p>THE AVERAGE DRIVER. Spends 55 minutes a day behind the wheel. Drives 29 miles a day. MEN VS. WOMEN. Women drive less (21 to 38 miles per day) Men drive longer (67 to 44 minutes per day) SOURCE: National Household Travel Survey, 2001-2002.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-speed-of-a-long-driver>What’s the average speed of a long driver?</h2>
<p>At the Professional Long Driver level, Trackman® shows us the following average club head speed numbers for the field at the World Long Drive Championships is about 135 mph. That means that a typical long driver is over 10 mph faster on average than the PGA TOUR’s fastest swinger.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-speed-of-a-road-bike>What’s the average speed of a road bike?</h2>
<p>According to Bicycling, the average recreational road biker moves at 17 to 18 miles per hour over flat terrain and 9 to 10 miles per hour over mountainous terrain. According to MIT Technology Review, in cities in Europe, bicyclists average 6.2 miles per hour except during rush hour, when they average 9.3 miles per hour.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-miles-can-the-average-person-bike-in-an-hour>How many miles can the average person bike in an hour?</h2>
<p>In urban environments and people who follow the laws on bicycles I would drop that down to around 8 MPH. So anywhere from 8 miles to 14 miles in one hour for the average cyclist on an average bike. A fit rider on a road bike can do 18 or more miles in an hour if they are not interrupted very often.</p>
