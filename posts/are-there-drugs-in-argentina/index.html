<h2 id=are-there-drugs-in-argentina>Are there drugs in Argentina?</h2>
<p>First, the country is a significant drug market, the region’s largest after Brazil. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that Argentina accounts for 25 percent of cocaine consumption in Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole, with levels of use five times higher than the regional average.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-drug-laws-in-argentina>What are the drug laws in Argentina?</h2>
<p>In 2009, a Supreme Court decision known as the “Arriola Ruling” found it to be unconstitutional to sentence people to prison for the possession of drugs for personal use. Nonetheless, the current drug law, still on the books and in force, continues to criminalize the possession of drugs for personal consumption.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-paco-drug>What is Paco drug?</h2>
<p>Paco, also known as PBC (pasta básica de cocaina, cocaine base paste), is a by-product of cocaine, made with cocaine waste mixed with highly toxic substances such as kerosene, ground glass or even rat poison.</p>

<p>Drug use is prohibited by the constitution, and there are laws banning it in certain specific circumstances, but it is not a criminal offence. Possession of the quantity of a drug permitted for personal use is not a crime.</p>
<h2 id=what-drugs-are-legal-in-uruguay>What drugs are legal in Uruguay?</h2>
<p>Cannabis is legal in Uruguay, and is one of the most widely used drugs in the nation. President José Mujica signed legislation to legalize recreational cannabis in December 2013, making Uruguay the first country in the modern era to legalize cannabis.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-drug-is-basuco>What kind of drug is Basuco?</h2>
<p>Basuco, with its name derived from the Spanish for “dirty trash of cocaine”, is a psychoactive by product of cocaine production, a residual paste left at the bottom of the barrel after the pure drug has been produced.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-basuco-mean-in-english>What does Basuco mean in English?</h2>
<p>Basuco is derived from the Spanish word for trash (basura), literally meaning “dirty trash” (of cocaine), referring to the paste left at the bottom of a barrel after cocaine production. Basuco is mostly smoked, either rolled like a cigarette with tobacco or cannabis, or more commonly from selfmade pipes.</p>

<p>Drug possession for personal use, for example, has been decriminalized in Uruguay since 1974. And while Mujica certainly deserves credit for taking a leading role on the issue, it is worth noting that the groundwork for legalization had already been laid by the time he took office.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-become-a-citizen-of-uruguay>How do I become a citizen of Uruguay?</h2>
<p>Legal citizens One can obtain the Uruguayan citizenship in three different ways: After 3 years of residence in the country if have a family (married or recognised union and/or children also living with you in Uruguay) After five years of residence.</p>
<h2 id=what-drug-is-colombian>What drug is Colombian?</h2>

The value of the cocaine trade is assessed at $10 billion per year in U.S. dollars. Colombia’s share of coca production is estimated at 43% of global production.</p>
