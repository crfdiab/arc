<p>Due to changing flight schedules in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Delta Cargo will temporarily embargo all PET shipments effective April 1, 2020, until further notice. The embargo applies to all live animals transported in cargo under the PET product code throughout the domestic and international network.</p>
<h2 id=is-delta-good-with-dogs>Is Delta good with dogs?</h2>
<p>Pets in the Cabin Delta Airlines welcomes passengers with small pets (dogs, cats, and household birds) in the cabin on most flights within the United States, Canada, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Pets are not permitted on flights to Hawaii.</p>
<h2 id=which-airlines-allow-pets-in-cabin-2020>Which airlines allow pets in cabin 2020?</h2>
<p>The main 3 airlines that allow pets in the cabin are: KLM, Lufthansa and TUI. This only applies for very small pets that weigh less than 8kg and would have to be booked direct through the airline, without the assistance of a pet export company like Fetchapet.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-dog-sit-with-you-on-a-plane>Can a dog sit with you on a plane?</h2>
<p>In-cabin. Generally, if your dog in its carrier can fit under the seat in front of you, it can go in the cabin. You can’t buy an extra seat for your dog. Traveling with a dog this way, essentially as carry-on luggage, usually incurs a lower fee than if it travels in the belly of the plane.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-pets-stay-on-a-plane>Where do pets stay on a plane?</h2>
<p>Though rules vary from airline to airline, your dog can typically only fly in the cabin—a.k.a. as a carry-on—if they are small enough to fit in a carrier under the seat in front of you. Any larger than that, and your pup will have to travel in the cargo hold, with the luggage and freight.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-take-a-dog-and-cat-on-a-delta-flight>Can you take a dog and Cat on a Delta Flight?</h2>
<p>The sedation of household dogs and cats is not permitted. Please keep in mind that Delta agents cannot administer medication of any kind. To keep your pet safe, we observe seasonal restrictions on pet travel. For your pet’s safety, we don’t ship pets during extreme weather.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-delta-take-care-of-their-pets>How does Delta take care of their pets?</h2>
<p>At Delta, we take the time and care to ensure every animal travels safely and comfortably. There are several different options available to get a pet to its final destination, including being brought into the cabin , checked as baggage , or shipped as cargo traveling without their owner.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-sunb-nosed-dog-go-on-a-delta-flight>Can a sunb nosed dog go on a Delta Flight?</h2>
<p>In the best interest of the animals, Delta does not accept sunb nosed pets for travel on any Delta or Delta Connection flights. Please consult your veterinarian if you are unsure regarding your pet’s breed. Please see Pets Acce pted for more information.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-ship-a-pet-with-delta>How long does it take to ship a pet with Delta?</h2>
<p>Review the following before booking: 1 A separate booking from their flight itinerary is required. 2 A pet shipped domestically via Delta Cargo cannot be booked until 14 days prior to departure 3 Pets are not guaranteed to be shipped on a customer’s same flight or flight schedule</p>
