<h2 id=how-did-hawaii-get-its-name-and-what-does-it-mean>How did Hawaii get its name and what does it mean?</h2>
<p>The state of Hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island, Hawaiʻi. A common Hawaiian explanation of the name of Hawaiʻi is that it was named for Hawaiʻiloa, a legendary figure from Hawaiian myth. He is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-a-person-from-hawaii>What do you call a person from Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Native Hawaiians, or simply Hawaiians (Hawaiian: kānaka ʻōiwi, kānaka maoli, and Hawaiʻi maoli), are the Indigenous Polynesian people of the Hawaiian Islands. The traditional name of the Hawaiian people is Kānaka Maoli. Hawaii was settled at least 800 years ago with the voyage of Polynesians from the Society Islands.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-state-of-hawaii-get-its-name>Where did the state of Hawaii get its name?</h2>
<p>A couple of theories exist on the origin of the name Hawaii. One theory has it that the name comes from a combination of the words “Hawa” and “ii” and means a small or new homeland; “Hawa” meaning a traditional homeland and “ii” meaning small and raging.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-hawaiian-word-hawaiki-come-from>Where does the Hawaiian word Hawaiki come from?</h2>
<p>There is no real contradiction in Hawaiki being both the ancestral homeland (that is, the dwelling place of the ancestors) and the underworld, which is also the dwelling place of ancestors and the spirits. Other possible cognates of the word Hawaiki include saualiʻi (“spirits” in Sāmoan) and houʻeiki (“chiefs” in Tongan ).</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-official-spelling-of-the-state-of-hawaii>What’s the official spelling of the state of Hawaii?</h2>
<p>The state’s “Hawaii Board on Geographic Names” is proposing a spelling change to officially include the Hawaiian diacritical mark. “Technically it’s not a name change. It’s a spelling correction,” said Kamana’o Mills, Hawaii Board on Geographic Names. “By leaving out the okina, it’s considered a misspelling.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-come-to-hawaii>Who was the first person to come to Hawaii?</h2>
<p>The first settlers to appear in Hawaii are believe to be the Polynesians, who first called the Hawaiian islands home around the eighth century, say authors at History.com.</p>
