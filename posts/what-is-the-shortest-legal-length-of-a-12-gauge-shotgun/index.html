<h2 id=what-is-the-shortest-legal-length-of-a-12-gauge-shotgun>What is the shortest legal length of a 12 gauge shotgun?</h2>
<p>A shotgun is a firearm subject to the NFA if the shotgun has a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length. A weapon made from a shotgun is also a firearm subject to the NFA if the weapon as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-minimum-length-for-a-sawed-off-shotgun>What is the minimum length for a sawed off shotgun?</h2>
<p>Barrel less than 18 inches and/or overall length less than 26 inches, stock altered, barrel cut down. Often mistakenly called a “sawed off shotgun.” In this instance overall length is determining factor.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-minimum-length-and-minimum-barrel-length-of-a-shotgun>What is the minimum length and minimum barrel length of a shotgun?</h2>
<p>18 inch<br>
These requirements may vary for different jurisdictions. Examples of minimum length requirements in federal law [ATF-NFA] include: 16 inch barrel length for rifles, 18 inch barrel length for shotguns, and 26 inch overall length for both rifles and shotguns.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-shortest-legal-shotgun-you-can-buy>What is the shortest legal shotgun you can buy?</h2>
<p>Under the National Firearms Act (NFA), it is illegal for a private citizen to possess a sawed-off modern smokeless powder shotgun (a shotgun with a barrel length shorter than 18 inches (46 cm) or a minimum overall length of the weapon, total, including the 18-inch minimum barrel, of under 26 inches (66 cm)) (under …</p>
<h2 id=why-are-sawed-off-shotguns-banned>Why are sawed off shotguns banned?</h2>
<p>Sawed-off shotguns are deadly weapons. This is because the shot propels faster from the shorter barrel than it would from a complete one. Another reason why sawed-off shotguns are illegal in most states is that they are concealable.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-a-short-barrel-shotgun-illegal>Why is a short barrel shotgun illegal?</h2>
<p>Short barreled shotguns without shoulder stocks and less than 26 inches in length are regulated under the NFA because they are easily concealed, and were favored by criminals at the time of the law’s passage.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-a-12-gauge-shotgun-barrel>How big is a 12 gauge shotgun barrel?</h2>
<p>A 12-gauge 2¾” long shell will typically hold nine (9) pellets of #00 buckshot. A 3-inch magnum shell will hold 12. 41″ bore diameter) with buckshot or slugs will be fatal too. Here’s a video that shows the difference in power/penetration between various sizes of shot shells using the common 12-gauge shotgun.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-a-choke-tube-for-a-shotgun>How big is a choke tube for a shotgun?</h2>
<p>As a general rule for standard chokes the total range will be between .000 and .045 thousandths of an inch under bore diameter. In the case of special purpose turkey chokes it can be as much as .100 or 1/10th of an inch. The length of the choke can vary as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-legal-length-of-a-shotgun-barrel>What is the legal length of a shotgun barrel?</h2>
<p>For the rifle, the legal length is 16” while the shotgun barrel should not go shorter than 18”. When the whole shotgun is measured, it should reach 26”. If in case you have a shotgu n with a shorter barrel, you have to prepare to register. You also have to pay taxes for it.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-barrel-of-a-browning-shotgun>How big is the barrel of a Browning shotgun?</h2>
<p>Therefore, a Browning Auto-5 or Remington Model 11-87 shotgun with an 18-5/8″/474mm barrel is non-restricted. Cut the barrel to 18-1/4″/464mm and it becomes a “restricted firearm.”</p>
