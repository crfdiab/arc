<h2 id=what-happened-to-king-charles-i-as-a-result-of-his-trial>What happened to King Charles I as a result of his trial?</h2>
<p>The King was declared guilty at a public session on Saturday 27 January 1649 and sentenced to death.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-they-decide-to-do-with-king-charles-i>What did they decide to do with King Charles I?</h2>
<p>After his defeat by Parliament in the Civil Wars, Charles I was imprisoned. On 20 January 1649 the High Court of Justice at Westminster Hall put him on trial for treason.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-charles-i-quizlet>What happened to Charles I quizlet?</h2>
<p>What happened to Charles I? He defeated the Cavaliers. He became a Puritan. He was tried and executed.</p>
<h2 id=did-charles-the-first-receive-a-fair-trial>Did Charles the first receive a fair trial?</h2>
<p>There was nothing allowed to be done or said to defend Charles- not even by himself. Only 59 of the 132 judges signed Charles’ death warrant, and some had to be forced to do so. Hardly any of the trial was fair, although some of the evidence given and perhaps one of accusations made were true.</p>
<h2 id=what-problems-did-charles-i-inherit>What problems did Charles I inherit?</h2>
<p>Charles had inherited disagreements with Parliament from his father, but his own actions, particularly engaging in ill-fated wars with France and Spain at the same time, eventually brought about a crisis in 1628-29.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-major-reason-the-radicals-were-so-angry>What was the major reason the Radicals were so angry?</h2>
<p>What was the major reason radicals were so angry? Europe wanted to put Louis XVI back in power. They wanted women and men to be able to vote. The revolution became more and more violent.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-james-ii-do-to-gain-absolute>What did James II do to gain absolute?</h2>
<p>What did James II do to gain absolute rule? He pursued Catholicism as the state religion and dismissed Parliament. to establish fair taxation standards.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-charles-choose-to-not-hold-his-peace>Why did Charles choose to not hold his peace?</h2>
<p>Charles refused to plead, saying that he did not recognise the legality of the High Court (it had been established by a Commons purged of dissent, and without the House of Lords – nor had the Commons ever acted as a judicature).</p>
