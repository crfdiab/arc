<p>The British, French, and Dutch Empires did not claim parts of the Americas until years after the Treaty of Tordesillas. More significantly, however, the Treaty of Tordesillas completely ignored the millions of people already living in established communities in the Americas.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-other-countries-respond-to-the-treaty-of-tordesillas>How did other countries respond to the Treaty of Tordesillas?</h2>
<p>How did other countries react to the Treaty of Tordesillas? – Quora. They pretty much ignored it. Most of the rest of Europe regarded the treaty as a settlement between Spain and Portugal which had nothing to do with them.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-effects-of-the-treaty-of-tordesillas>What were the effects of the Treaty of Tordesillas?</h2>
<p>When the Treaty of Tordesillas was created, the Americas were already home to many established civilizations and innumerable communities of people—from the Inuit in the far north, to the Aztecs in Mesoamerica, to the Taino in the Caribbean, to the Inca in the Andes, to the many different branches of Tupi-speaking …</p>
<h2 id=what-effect-did-the-treaty-of-tordesillas-have-on-europe>What effect did the Treaty of Tordesillas have on Europe?</h2>
<p>The treaty gave most of the Western Hemisphere to Spain. The pope was no longer the supreme religious and political authority in Europe. European nations stopped looking for new western routes to India.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-treaty-of-tordesillas-gave-portugal>What did the Treaty of Tordesillas gave Portugal?</h2>
<p>The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in Tordesillas, Spain on 7 June 1494, and authenticated in Setúbal, Portugal, divided the newly-discovered lands outside Europe between the Portuguese Empire and the Spanish Empire (Crown of Castile), along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, off the west coast of …</p>
<h2 id=what-effect-did-the-treaty-of-versailles-have-on-europe>What effect did the Treaty of Versailles have on Europe?</h2>
<p>“It put small states on Germany’s borders, in eastern and central Europe. It eliminated Russia as a direct enemy of Germany, at least in the 1920s, and it removed Russia as an ally of France.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-spain-get-from-the-treaty-of-tordesillas>What did Spain get from the Treaty of Tordesillas?</h2>
<p>Spain was acknowledged sovereignty over the Philippines, while Portugal would get the territory of the Amazon River basin. Portugal would relinquish the colony of Sacramento, on the northern bank of the River Plata in modern-day Uruguay, while getting the territory of the Seven Missions.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-reaction-to-the-treaty-of-versailles>What was the reaction to the Treaty of Versailles?</h2>
<p>From January to June 1919, the world’s most powerful politicians met and tried to work out a peace settlement to end the Great War. The treaty that concerned them most was the treaty with Germany. When it was finally announced in 1919, the Treaty of Versailles provoked very mixed reactions.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-england-react-to-the-french-occupation-of-the-netherlands>How did England react to the French occupation of the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>England reacted to the French occupation of the Netherlands and the flight and overthrow of the stadtholder by a declaration of war and a blockade. Dutch overseas trade and fishing, the country’s most essential occupations, were brought to a near standstill, while most of the Dutch colonies were seized by the English on behalf of William V.</p>

<p>But the good news traveled very slowly to places that were further away. In the Moluccas, the Spice Islands, the Dutch beat the Spanish in a great battle in 1649, a year after the treaty had been signed establishing peace, because none of them had yet heard the news from Europe. When Pope Innocent learned of this treaty, he condemned it.</p>
