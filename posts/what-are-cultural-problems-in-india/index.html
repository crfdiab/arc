<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-social-problems-in-india>Why are there so many social problems in India?</h2>
<p>India’s social problems are also rooted in the religious practices and beliefs of it people. Almost all forms of social issues and problems find their origin in the religious and cultural practices of the people of India.</p>
