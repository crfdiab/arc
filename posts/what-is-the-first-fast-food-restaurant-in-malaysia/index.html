<h2 id=is-kfc-malaysia-good>Is KFC Malaysia Good?</h2>
<p>KFC Malaysia is still my favorite! As always, KFC Malaysia is my favorite. Their chicken is very big and what I love the most is the Colonel rice partnered with it. The taste is really good that this is the first thing we crave everytime we go to Malaysia (both East and West).</p>

In America, it had around 390 stores as of 2005, most of which were in the mid-west, and all of which were still owned by the founding family. Growth is financed out of cash-flow.</p>

<p>1916 — The first store opened in Wichita, Kansas in 1916 in the premises of an old shoe store (Billy Ingram says it was a “renovated streetcar.” [3]) For customers, Anderson had a table and 3 stools.
