<h2 id=what-methods-did-the-dutch-east-india-company-used-to-control-trade-in-indonesia>What methods did the Dutch East India Company used to control trade in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>Throughout the 1620s the Dutch East India Company further colonized Indonesia’s islands and the presence of Dutch plantations growing cloves and nutmeg for export grew across the region. At this time the Dutch East India Company, like other European trading companies, used gold and silver to buy spices.</p>

<p>three and a half centuries<br>
For example, when you talk to an Indonesian individual about the colonial period (whether the individual is highly educated or uneducated) he/she will say that Indonesia was colonized by the Dutch for three and a half centuries.</p>

<p>Indonesian Perceptions For example, when you talk to an Indonesian individual about the colonial period (whether the individual is highly educated or uneducated) he/she will say that Indonesia was colonized by the Dutch for three and a half centuries.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-the-dutch-have-control-of-indonesia>How long did the Dutch have control of Indonesia?</h2>
<p>The Dutch controlled Indonesia longer and had more influence on Indonesia than any other country. The Dutch had some form of influence on Indonesia from 1602 up until 1949. That is 347 years of influence.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-dutch-east-india-company-do-in-indonesia>What did the Dutch East India Company do in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>During the 17th century the VOC went far toward establishing commercial control in the Indonesian islands. It captured Malacca from the Portuguese (1641), confined the British—after a period of fierce rivalry—to a factory at Bencoolen (now Bengkulu ), in southwestern Sumatra, and established a network of factories in the eastern islands.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-dutch-do-after-the-end-of-voc>What did the Dutch do after the end of VOC?</h2>
<p>The end of VOC was not the end of Dutch’s effort to colonize Indonesia. The Dutch appointed Sir Herman William Daendels as Governor for Indonesia. He was commissioned by the Dutch king to regulate Indonesia, preserving Indonesia from the British royal offensive and regulating the welfare.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-world-war-2-on-indonesia>What was the impact of World War 2 on Indonesia?</h2>
<p>World War II also became one of the factors of the collapse of Dutch power in Indonesia. Here was the end of the Dutch colonization in Indonesia. Finally, Indonesia today could claim its independence for more than 62 years. No matter what, history was just a history.</p>
