<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-achilles-kingdom>What is the name of Achilles Kingdom?</h2>
<p>the Myrmidons<br>
In the Iliad, every Greek kingdom sends a contingent to fight at Troy. Most of them are led by a king; the men from Phthia are led by a royal prince, Achilles. But as a superb soldier, Achilles earned the respect of his men. Of all the Greek units, his is the only one to have a special name: the Myrmidons.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-achilles-heel-and-why-is-it-called-that-name>What is an Achilles heel and why is it called that name?</h2>
<p>The tendon is named after the ancient Greek mythological figure Achilles because it lies at the only part of his body that was still vulnerable after his mother had dipped him (holding him by the heel) into the River Styx.</p>
<h2 id=who-has-the-achilles-heel>Who has the Achilles heel?</h2>
<p>The warrior Achilles is one of the great heroes of Greek mythology. According to legend, Achilles was extraordinarily strong, courageous and loyal, but he had one vulnerability–his “Achilles heel.” Homer’s epic poem The Iliad tells the story of his adventures during the last year of the Trojan War.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-achilles-mean-in-english>What does Achilles mean in English?</h2>
<p>1 : the greatest warrior among the Greeks at Troy and slayer of Hector. 2 : achilles tendon.</p>
<h2 id=is-achilles-a-hero>Is Achilles a hero?</h2>
<p>Who was Achilles? In Greek mythology, Achilles was the strongest warrior and hero in the Greek army during the Trojan War. He was the son of Peleus, king of the Myrmidons, and Thetis, a sea nymph. The story of Achilles appears in Homer’s Iliad and elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id=why-didnt-achilles-cover-his-heel>Why didn’t Achilles cover his heel?</h2>
<p>Quite the reverse, it’s prophesied that he’ll be killed in battle. Ancient Greek warriors wore relatively little armor. They did wear greaves, which cover the shin and front of the leg from the knee down, but not the achilles’ heel. They didn’t wear chausses, which were like mail stockings and a later invention.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-tendon-that-connects-your-calf-to-your-heel-called-your-achilles>Why is the tendon that connects your calf to your heel called your Achilles?</h2>
<p>The Achilles tendon or heel cord, also known as the calcaneal tendon, is a tendon at the back of the lower leg, and is the thickest in the human body. It serves to attach the plantaris, gastrocnemius (calf) and soleus muscles to the calcaneus (heel) bone….</p>

<h2 id=is-achilles-a-good-name>Is Achilles a good name?</h2>
<p>Achilles is a rarely used name; it has never made it to America’s Top 1000 list of baby boy names, though he may be inching in that direction. The name’s theorized meaning (“pain”) isn’t exactly pleasant, but if you can get past that small detail, you’re good to go.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-hector-have-to-die-and-not-achilles>Why did Hector have to die and not Achilles?</h2>
<p>Although Hector wore Achilles’ own enchanted armor, Achilles manages to drive a spear through the space between the shoulder and collar bone, the only place the armor does not protect. Hector dies prophesying Achilles’ own death, which will be brought on by his hubris and stubbornness.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-achillesheel-the-weak-spot-of-the-body>Is the achilles’heel the weak spot of the body?</h2>
<p>On your body, your Achilles’ heel is the tendon on the back of your ankle. In spoken English, your Achilles’ heel is your weak spot. You can say either “Achilles’ heel” or “Achilles’(s) heel.” Both are correct. The Greek story of Achilles’ heel is the one Homer tells in the long poem called “The Iliad.” Here is how the story goes.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-achilles-tendon-on-the-back-of-the-ankle>Is the Achilles tendon on the back of the ankle?</h2>
<p>The Greek poet Homer has given us many phrases. A famous one is “Achilles’ heel.”. On your body, your Achilles’ heel is the tendon on the back of your ankle. In spoken English, your Achilles’ heel is your weak spot.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-achilles-get-shot-in-the-heel>How did Achilles get shot in the heel?</h2>
<p>The term is derived from the Greek myth of the hero Achilles, whose mother held him by the heel while dipping him into the River Styx to make him immortal. He eventually was killed by an arrow shot into his heel. The term became a literary metaphor about two centuries ago and remains current as a cliché. A vulnerable spot that leads to a downfall.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-story-of-achilles-heel-in-the-iliad-correct>Is the story of Achilles heel in the Iliad correct?</h2>
<p>You can say either “Achilles’ heel” or “Achilles’ (s) heel.” Both are correct. The Greek story of Achilles’ heel is the one Homer tells in the long poem called “The Iliad.” Here is how the story goes. When Achilles was a baby his mother bathed him in the river Styx. She believed the river had magical powers.</p>
