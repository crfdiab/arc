<h2 id=what-was-the-biggest-problem-with-finding-the-northwest-passage>What was the biggest problem with finding the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>Traversing the frozen Northwest Passage historically has required a hazardous journey through thousands of giant icebergs that could rise up to 300 feet above the surface of the water and huge masses of sea ice that could seal the passage and trap ships for months at a time.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-problem-with-the-northwest-passage>What was the problem with the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>The Northwest Passage has an identity crisis. The US thinks it’s international waters. Canada claims it as their internal waters. And as traffic through the arctic sea route increases, experts worry its disputed legal status is leaving the northern Arctic vulnerable to catastrophe.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-reason-for-searching-for-the-northwest-passage>What was the main reason for searching for the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>The Northwest Passage is a sea corridor connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through Canada’s Arctic Archipelago islands and along the northern-most coast of North America. Europeans searched for 300 years to find a viable sea trade-route to Asia.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-northwest-passage-hard-to-find>Why was the Northwest Passage hard to find?</h2>
<p>In the past, the Northwest Passage has been virtually impassable because it was covered by thick, year-round sea ice. However, in recent years, climate change is allowing commercial traffic to pass through the Arctic via this once-impossible route.</p>
<h2 id=did-they-find-a-northwest-passage>Did they find a Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>The belief that a route lay to the far north persisted for several centuries and led to numerous expeditions into the Arctic. Many ended in disaster, including that by Sir John Franklin in 1845. While searching for him the McClure Arctic Expedition discovered the Northwest Passage in 1850.</p>
<h2 id=who-controls-the-northwest-passage>Who controls the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>America has long maintained that the Northwest Passage, which has up to seven different routes, is an international strait through which its commercial and military vessels have the right to pass without seeking Canada’s permission.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-looking-for-the-northwest-passage>Who was looking for the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>John Franklin<br>
The many searches for the missing explorer John Franklin led to the discovery of all the Arctic waterways. The knowledge gained from these voyages helped Amundsen to finally cross the Northwest Passage in 1903-06.</p>
<h2 id=do-ships-use-the-northwest-passage>Do ships use the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>Five general cargo ships and five passenger ships made a full transit through the Northwest Passage, a series of routes snaking through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago between the Baffin Bay in the east and the Beaufort Sea in the west.</p>
<h2 id=does-canada-own-the-northwest-passage>Does Canada own the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>From a Canadian perspective the Northwest Passage is internal waters and completely Canadian. Furthermore the Inuits who have inhabited the northern parts of Canada for about 4,000 years, giving the Canadian government a historical claim over the passage.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-canada-claim-the-northwest-passage>Why does Canada claim the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>Canada has long claimed the Northwest Passage as internal territorial waters, on the basis of a long history of native Inuit use of the waters, as well as legal arguments stemming from decades-old cases settled by the the International Court of Justice.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-northwest-passage-impassable-in-the-past>Why was the Northwest Passage impassable in the past?</h2>
<p>What Is the Northwest Passage? The Northwest Passage is a sea route that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. In the past, the Northwest Passage has been virtually impassable because it was covered by thick, year-round sea ice.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-red-lines-in-the-northwest-passage>Where are the red lines in the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>Northwest Passage Map: The red lines are possible routes that ships can use to traverse the Northwest Passage, a shipping route that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean through the Canadian Arctic. Geology.com/MapResources. Click to Enlarge Image. What Is the Northwest Passage?</p>
<h2 id=why-was-henry-hudson-hired-to-find-the-northwest-passage>Why was Henry Hudson hired to find the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>He is credited with proving that California is a peninsula, not an island–a popular misconception at the time. In 1609, the merchants of the Dutch East India Company hired English explorer Henry Hudson to find the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-pacific-whales-in-the-northwest-passage>Are there Pacific whales in the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>Experts think the Pacific whales may have made their way through the open waters of the Northwest Passage and the Arctic Ocean into the Atlantic. Increased access to the route has stirred up a decades-old debate over who controls the Arctic waters.</p>
