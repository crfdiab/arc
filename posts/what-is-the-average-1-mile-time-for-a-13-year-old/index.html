<h2 id=what-is-the-average-1-mile-time-for-a-13-year-old>What is the average 1 mile time for a 13 year old?</h2>
<p>The average mile time for a 13 year old boy is probably around 7:45–8:25. At my school, the majority of kids who try run in that range. If you run a sub 9 that is still a solid time. When I was 13 I ran a 6:23.</p>
<h2 id=whats-a-good-mile-time-for-a-girl>Whats a good mile time for a girl?</h2>
<p>Average Mile Time The average time for all runners for a single mile is between 9 and 10 minutes. Men, in general, average a little bit faster – right around the 9:00 barrier. Women average somewhere in the 10:00 range.</p>
<h2 id=how-fast-should-a-teenage-girl-run-a-mile>How fast should a teenage girl run a mile?</h2>
<p>Teenage can range from 13 to 19 years old. Huge gap. But for one mile my fairly educated guess would be 11 minutes to be average for a teenage girl. A girl in decent shape should be able to run one 8 minute mile.</p>
<h2 id=how-fast-should-a-7th-grader-run-a-mile>How fast should a 7th grader run a mile?</h2>
<p>For 7th-8th grade, good times would be 8:30–6:30 for girls and 7:00–5:00 for boys.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-fast-mile-time-for-a-14-year-old>What is a fast mile time for a 14 year old?</h2>
<p>Best Answer: A good but not great time would be 8 minutes for girls and 7 minutes for boys. The best your likely to see is 6 minutes for girls and 5 minutes for boys.</p>
<h2 id=whats-a-good-1-mile-time>What’s a good 1 mile time?</h2>
<p>A noncompetitive, relatively in-shape runner usually completes one mile in about 9 to 10 minutes, on average. If you’re new to running, you might run one mile in closer to 12 to 15 minutes as you build up endurance. Elite marathon runners average a mile in around 4 to 5 minutes.</p>
<h2 id=how-fast-can-a-14-year-old-girl-run>How fast can a 14-year-old girl run?</h2>
<p>After participating in 52 weeks of training, 12- and 13-year-old girls should aim to run the 100-meter sprint in 13.2 seconds and the 200-meter sprint in 26.5 seconds. Intermediate female sprinters ages 14 and 15 should achieve a time of 11.6 seconds in the 100-meter sprint and 26 seconds in the 200-meter sprint.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-should-a-14-year-old-girl-run-a-mile>How long should a 14-year-old girl run a mile?</h2>
<p>Between the ages of 10 and 14, the average girls’ mile time improves from 11 minutes and 22 seconds to 10 minutes and 6 seconds. The winning time was 5:14. A brisk pace for a 20-something is not the same as a brisk pace for an 80-year-old, and your walking speed will vary depending on the kind of walk youâ€™re doing.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-mile-time-for-girls>What is the average mile time for girls?</h2>
<p>Between the ages of 10 and 14, the average girls’ mile time improves from 11 minutes and 22 seconds to 10 minutes and 6 seconds. Male runners of the same age complete a mile run more quickly than girls, on average. Girls running a half mile can complete the run at a time of between 55 minutes and 5 minutes, 54 seconds.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-running-speed-of-a-13-year-old-girl>What’s the average running speed of a 13 year old girl?</h2>
<p>After participating in 52 weeks of training, 12- and 13-year-old girls should aim to run the 100-meter sprint in 13.2 seconds and the 200-meter sprint in 26.5 seconds.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-12-year-old-run-a-4-minute-mile>Can a 12 year old run a 4 minute mile?</h2>
<p>The four minute mile for a 12 year old girl is straight-up impossible. That’s slightly less then thirty seconds per two hundred meters the whole way. Running that fast all-out is pretty much unheard of for that age and gender, let alone such a mile time. If you running at 8 minutes, you doing well.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-time-for-a-half-mile>What’s the average time for a half mile?</h2>
<p>Girls running a half mile can complete the run at a time of between 55 minutes and 5 minutes, 54 seconds. These times are based upon an age range of 6 to 10 years old, with 10-year-olds averaging 5 minutes.</p>
