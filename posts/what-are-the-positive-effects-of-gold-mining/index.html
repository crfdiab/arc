<h2 id=what-are-the-positive-effects-of-gold-mining>What are the positive effects of gold mining?</h2>
<p>Positive Impacts of Mining Gold for Employment & Training Equipping local communities with skills and training helps gold mining companies to build a workforce for the long-term and helps individuals into productive employment.</p>
<h2 id=how-important-is-mining-in-south-africa>How important is mining in South Africa?</h2>
<p>Mining accounts for up to 60% of South Africa’s exports, which is vital for bringing in cash into the country. The minerals it exports are vital to the economies of the world for manufacturing.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-benefits-of-being-a-miner>What are the benefits of being a miner?</h2>
<p>As a developed society we are fortunate to enjoy the many benefits that lignite, uranium and industrial minerals help provide. These benefits include low-cost, reliable electricity and the materials necessary to build our homes, schools, hospitals, roads, highways, bridges and airports.</p>
<h2 id=who-owns-mines-in-south-africa>Who owns mines in South Africa?</h2>
<p>The primary South African sources of diamonds, including seven large diamond mines around the country, are controlled by the De Beers Consolidated Mines Company.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-gold-miners-in-south-africa>Who are the gold miners in South Africa?</h2>
<p>South African Gold Mining. This paved the way for the formalised gold mining sector to take control and regulate the gold mining in South Africa. Today, companies like Anglo American, Harmony Gold and BHP Billiton, etc. are established as industry leaders of gold mining in South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-gold-is-there-in-south-africa>How much gold is there in South Africa?</h2>
<p>Platinum Mining in South Africa. Gold mining in South Africa had, by 1975, produced 40% of gold ever mined. However, by 2009, China affirmed its status as the world’s largest gold producer with a production of 324 tonnes, followed by Australia at 222.8, and South Africa with 219.8 tonnes (a decrease of 6%).</p>
<h2 id=how-is-mining-affecting-the-economy-of-south-africa>How is mining affecting the economy of South Africa?</h2>
<p>SA mining is in crisis. And the travails of SA mining, more particularly those of gold and platinum mining are having a very negative impact on GDP and expected GDP growth and on the value of the rand.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-ghana-benefiting-from-gold-mining>How is Ghana benefiting from gold mining?</h2>
<p>In Ghana, the African Development Bank has noted the emergence of a range of component manufacturers, construction companies and high value advisory and professional services to support the growth of mining across West Africa. In addition, the multipliers from today’s higher-skilled mining jobs can be considerable.</p>
