<h2 id=what-is-a-aboriginal-tribe>What is a Aboriginal tribe?</h2>
<p>A tribe, in the Aboriginal context, is a group of people related by genealogy, a common language and occupying (or traditionally occupying) a recognised area of country. ‘Tribe’ is a European word that tends to imply western preconceptions developed from colonial experiences.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-considered-aboriginal>Who is considered Aboriginal?</h2>
<p>The Commonwealth Parliament defined an Aboriginal person as “a person who is a member of the Aboriginal race of Australia”, a definition which was still in use in the early 1990s. Stop insulting Aboriginal people or we may have to consider calling white Australians half-caste convicts.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-correct-term-for-aboriginal-tribes>What is the correct term for Aboriginal tribes?</h2>
<p>‘Aboriginal peoples’ (plural) is a preferred term used by some, to refer to the many Aboriginal groups within Australia. It is estimated that prior to colonisation there were over 500 groups. ‘Aboriginal Australians’ is another term used to further describe the Aboriginal peoples of Australia.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-people-are-the-aboriginal-people-of-australia>What kind of people are the Aboriginal people of Australia?</h2>
<p>Australian Aboriginal peoples, one of the two distinct groups of Indigenous peoples of Australia, the other being the Torres Strait Islander peoples.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-generally-accepted-definition-of-indigenous-peoples>What is the generally accepted definition of indigenous peoples?</h2>
<p>First, as it stands, there is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous Peoples in a global context. Some countries refer to Indigenous Peoples as the people who were there first at contact. Others refer to Indigenous Peoples as the nomadic peoples within their borders.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-aboriginal-people-connected-to-their-land>How are Aboriginal people connected to their land?</h2>
<p>This connection remains despite the many Aboriginal people who no longer live on their land. Aboriginal people describe the land as sustaining and comforting, fundamental to their health, their relationships and their culture and identity.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-aboriginal-community-get-a-new-definition>When did the Aboriginal community get a new definition?</h2>
<p>It took a ‘Report on a Review of the Administration of the Working Definition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders’ in 1981 to propose a new definition (my emphasis): is accepted as such by the community in which he (she) lives.”</p>
