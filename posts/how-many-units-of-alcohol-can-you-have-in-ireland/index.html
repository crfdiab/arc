<h2 id=how-many-units-of-alcohol-can-you-have-in-ireland>How many units of alcohol can you have in Ireland?</h2>
<p>In Ireland, a unit (or a ‘standard drink’) contains 10g of pure alcohol. In Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, a unit contains 8g of pure alcohol. One standard drink, or one Irish unit of alcohol, ordered in a pub in Dublin equates to: One small glass of wine (12.5% volume)</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-standard-measure-of-spirits-in-ireland>What is a standard measure of spirits in Ireland?</h2>
<p>35.5ml<br>
In Ireland a standard drink has about 10 grams of pure alcohol. In the UK a standard drink, also called a unit of alcohol, has about 8 grams of pure alcohol. Some examples of a standard drink in Ireland are: a pub measure of spirits (35.5ml)</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-legal-measurement-for-spirits>What is the legal measurement for spirits?</h2>
<p>In practice, most bars will use the same size measure as for the four spirits. The 1963 Act formalized the legal measures by which spirits and other alcoholic beverages should be dispensed, namely 1/4 gill (35.5 ml), 1/5 gill (28.4 ml) or 1/6 gill (23.7 ml), but this was replaced in 1985 by 25ml or 35ml were permitted.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-alcohol-can-be-served-in-one-drink>How much alcohol can be served in one drink?</h2>
<p>A standard drink is 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine or 1-1/4 ounces of 80 proof distilled spirits.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-alcohol-is-too-much-ireland>How much alcohol is too much Ireland?</h2>
<p>A NEW GLOBAL health study of nearly 600,000 drinkers has concluded that recommended weekly alcohol consumption should be lower than Ireland’s current level. Current Irish guidelines recommend a limit of 170g pure alcohol (17 standard drinks) per week for men and 110g pure alcohol (11 standard drinks) for women.</p>

<table><tr><th>The Drink</th><th>The Strength</th><th>The Amount</th></tr><tr><td>Spirits (Vodka,Whiskey,Gin,etc.)</td><td>40%</td><td>Single measure in a pub (35ml)</td></tr><tr><td>Alcopops</td><td></td><td>275ml bottle</td></tr><tr><td>Shots</td><td>40%</td><td>35.5ml</td></tr><tr><td>Cocktails</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-a-double-shot-alcohol>What is a double shot alcohol?</h2>
<p>A drink ordered as a “Double” means that it has double the amount of alcohol in the drink, but the same amount of other ingredients. Generally a single drink contains about 1.5 ounces of alcohol, so a double will equal 3 ounces.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-ml-is-a-double-shot>How many ml is a double shot?</h2>
<p>59.14ml<br>
The national standard is that a single pour or shot is 1.5oz (44.3ml or 4.4cl) and a double pour is 2oz (59.14ml or 5.9cl).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-four-types-of-drinkers>What are the four types of drinkers?</h2>
<p>Their study, which involved 374 undergraduates at a large Midwestern university, drew from literature and pop culture in order to conclude that there are four types of drinkers: the Mary Poppins, the Ernest Hemingway, the Nutty Professor and the Mr. Hyde.</p>
<h2 id=is-12-alcohol-a-lot>Is 12 alcohol a lot?</h2>
<p>The rule of thumb is that a glass of wine is worth one standard drink and women get one of these a night and men get two. However, this makes the assumption that the wine is only 12% ABV. So if you’re drinking a high-alcohol wine like Port or Thunderbird (at 20% ABV), the recommended serving size is about half.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-serving-process-the-same-in-ireland>Is the serving process the same in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Serving process in Ireland is subject to the strictures of the Hague Service Convention, regardless of which U.S. or Canadian venue is hearing the matter. To be sure, service in Northern Ireland is handled a bit differently, as it’s part of the United Kingdom, but not entirely differently.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-serve-triple-vodka-in-scotland>Is it illegal to serve triple vodka in Scotland?</h2>
<p>In Scotland, the issues are health protection, irresponsible drinking and so on. It’s not illegal to serve a triple, but if someone you served triples to was found ill or injured later, there could be a question of due diligence. It’s the licencee coving themselves and their business, as they have to now.</p>
