<h2 id=what-attracted-european-settlers-to-the-middle-colonies>What attracted European settlers to the Middle Colonies?</h2>
<p>Unlike New England, the Middle Colonies had richer, less rocky soil, allowing the area to become a major exporter of wheat and other grains. Abundant forests attracted the lumbering and shipbuilding industries to the Middle Colonies.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-european-settlers-go-to-america>Why did European settlers go to America?</h2>
<p>European nations came to the Americas to increase their wealth and broaden their influence over world affairs. Many of the people who settled in the New World came to escape religious persecution. The Pilgrims, founders of Plymouth, Massachusetts, arrived in 1620.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-dutch-settle-in-new-york>Where did the Dutch settle in New York?</h2>
<p>The surrender was reluctantly made; but, on his departure, the Dutch continued their residence. During the following year in 1614, the Dutch constructed a rude fort on the southern part of the island, which was the beginning of New Amsterdam, afterward called New York.</p>

The Dutch attempted to found their first colony during the late 1620’s, when Dutch trading interests established the colony of New Netherland, with New Amsterdam as its capital.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-swedes-settle-in-new-york>Where did the Swedes settle in New York?</h2>
<p>About the same time that Kieft began his administration, a colony of Swedes, under ex-Governor Minuits, had arrived, and formed a settlement on Christiana Creek, near Wilmington, in the present State of Delaware.
