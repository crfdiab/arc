<h2 id=why-did-the-french-huguenots-immigrate-to-america>Why did the French Huguenots immigrate to America?</h2>
<p>Huguenots were French Protestants who were active in the 16th and 17th centuries. Forced to flee France due to religious and political persecution by the Catholic Church and the Crown, many settled in what is now the United States of America.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-huguenots-land-in-florida>Where did the Huguenots land in Florida?</h2>
<p>Life was difficult for the Protestant Huguenots in Catholic France. When they arrived at the mouth of the St. Johns River in Florida, they stopped there and built a triangle-shaped fort for protection. They called it Fort Caroline.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-huguenots-try-to-colonize-florida>Did the Huguenots try to colonize Florida?</h2>
<p>French Florida (modern French: Floride française) was a colonial territory established by French Huguenot colonists in what is now Florida and South Carolina between 1562 and 1565. In 1564, René Goulaine de Laudonnière again traveled from France, this time to establish Fort Caroline, in what is now Jacksonville.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-huguenots-have-slaves>Did the Huguenots have slaves?</h2>
<p>When the Huguenots arrived in the Hudson River Valley in the 1660s, they entered a slave-owning society. The Huguenots did not enslave people in France or Germany, but they soon took up the practice in their new homes.</p>
<h2 id=do-huguenots-still-exist>Do Huguenots still exist?</h2>
<p>Huguenots are still around today, they are now more commonly known as ‘French Protestants’. Huguenots were (and still are) a minority in France. At their peak, they were thought to have only represented ten (10) percent of the French population.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-issue-of-the-huguenots-solved>How was the issue of the Huguenots solved?</h2>
<p>In spite of fierce opposition by the Roman Catholic clergy, an edict in 1787 restored in part the civil rights of the Huguenots. In November 1789, with the birth of the French Revolution, the National Assembly affirmed the liberty of religion and granted Protestants admission to all offices and professions.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-got-rid-of-the-french-huguenots-in-florida>Which country got rid of the French Huguenots in Florida?</h2>
<p>To remove the twin threats of French encroachment and of Protestant heresy, King Philip II of Spain dispatched Pedro Menendez de Aviles, an able seaman and devout Catholic, to rid Florida of this French menace.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-huguenots-famous-for>What were the Huguenots famous for?</h2>
<p>Huguenots were French Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries who followed the teachings of theologian John Calvin. Persecuted by the French Catholic government during a violent period, Huguenots fled the country in the 17th century, creating Huguenot settlements all over Europe, in the United States and Africa.</p>
