<h2 id=how-did-the-railroad-help-businesses-grow>How did the railroad help businesses grow?</h2>
<p>As the chief system of transportation of goods and people, railroads were essential to American industry. The construction of the railroads spawned huge new industries in steel, iron, and coal. No other business so dramatically stimulated and embodied the industrialization process.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-growth-of-railroads-impact-businesses-and-industry>How did the growth of railroads impact businesses and industry?</h2>
<p>The developing railroads rapidly became huge businesses, imperative to the success of American enterprise. The material needs of the railroads helped create several other big industries, such as iron, steel, copper, glass, machine tools, and oil.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-railroad-industry-help-the-economy-to-grow>How did the railroad industry help the economy to grow?</h2>
<p>Eventually, railways lowered the cost of transporting many kinds of goods across great distances. Busy transport links increased the growth of cities. The transportation system helped to build an industrial economy on a national scale.</p>

<h2 id=forest-products-how-did-the-railroads-impact-the-american-economy>Forest Products. How did the railroads impact the American economy?</h2>
<p>The growth of railroads heavily impacted American businesses. The businesses started to buy up land along the railroad tracks in order to easily send goods to somewhere, easily take in goods, and they have advertisement for their shop or company next to the railroad. How did the transcontinental railroad transform the West?</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-railroads-create-a-national-market>How did the railroads create a national market?</h2>
<p>As railroad tracks stretched across America, they helped to create a national market (Porter 3). Jay Gould helped turn railroads into big business. Gould, admittedly, knew nothing about railroads or their operation, but he did know business strategy.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-growth-of-big-business-affect-the-economy>How did the growth of big business affect the economy?</h2>
<p>The rising city population fed the ever-expanding market. The strong market, in turn, stimulated greater production, which created more jobs. This is known as the multiplier affect (Roark 430). Railroads were America’s first big business and did much to advance industrialization.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-jay-gould-make-railroads-big-business>How did Jay Gould make railroads big business?</h2>
<p>Jay Gould helped turn railroads into big business. Gould, admittedly, knew nothing about railroads or their operation, but he did know business strategy. When he detected a vulnerable railroad company, he would buy enough of their stock to take control.</p>
