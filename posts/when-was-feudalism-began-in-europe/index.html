<p>11th century<br>
Origins of Feudalism The feudal system proper became widespread in Western Europe from the 11th century onwards, largely thanks to the Normans as their rulers carved up and dished out lands wherever their armies conquered.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-feudalism-begin-in-europe>Why did feudalism begin in Europe?</h2>
<p>Beginning in the late 700s C.E., large numbers of invaders raided villages throughout Europe. This resulted in a collapse of law and order, a decline in trade, and collapse of local economies. They created a system of military and political relationships called feudalism. …</p>
<h2 id=how-many-years-did-feudalism-last-in-europe>How many years did feudalism last in Europe?</h2>
<p>Feudalism flourished in Europe between the 9th and 15th centuries. Feudalism in England determined the structure of society around relationships derived from the holding and leasing of land, or fiefs.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-feudalism-start-in-the-middle-ages>When did feudalism start in the Middle Ages?</h2>
<p>Feudalism, also called feudal system or feudality, French féodalité, historiographic construct designating the social, economic, and political conditions in western Europe during the early Middle Ages, the long stretch of time between the 5th and 12th centuries.

<h2 id=when-did-feudalism-end-in-the-french-revolution>When did feudalism end in the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>Even when the original feudal relationships had disappeared, there were many institutional remnants of feudalism left in place. Historian Georges Lefebvre explains how at an early stage of the French Revolution, on just one night of August 4, 1789, France abolished the long-lasting remnants of the feudal order.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-21st-century-a-version-of-feudalism>Is the 21st century a version of feudalism?</h2>
<p>On a purely philosophical level, some might even argue that 21st century capitalism is a shiny version of feudalism (neo-feudalism), wherein people perpetually owe money on their homes (property tax) and income (income tax) on both a state and national level (in the case of the United States, for example).</p>
