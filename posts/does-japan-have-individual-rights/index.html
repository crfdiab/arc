<h2 id=does-japan-have-individual-rights>Does Japan have individual rights?</h2>
<p>Japan lacks any law which prohibits racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination, or discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The country also has no national human rights institutions. Critics call this practice, which is legal and encouraged in Japan, coercive and a form of human trafficking.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-overall-level-of-rights-and-freedoms-in-japan>What is the overall level of rights and freedoms in Japan?</h2>
<p>Japan: Japanese citizens have freedom in their choices of residence, profession, education, and the right to vote. North Korea: The North Korean supreme leader controls every aspect of his citizens’ lives and they have no freedom or rights.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-most-important-individual-rights>What are the most important individual rights?</h2>
<p>The United States values free speech as the most important human right, with the right to vote coming in third.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-japan-handle-gun-control>How does Japan handle gun control?</h2>
<p>Handguns are banned outright. Only shotguns and air rifles are allowed. The law restricts the number of gun shops. In most of Japan’s 40 or so prefectures there can be no more than three, and you can only buy fresh cartridges by returning the spent cartridges you bought on your last visit.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-human-rights-in-japan>What do you need to know about human rights in Japan?</h2>
<p>In June, a law was revised with the goal of ensuring that companies take measures to stop employees from being harassed by staff in positions of relative power. The revision included provisions to protect LGBTI people from “outing” or other abuse based on sexual orientation, gender identity and expression.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-japan-rank-on-human-rights-index>Where does Japan rank on Human Rights Index?</h2>
<p>The Fragile States Index ranked Japan second last in the G7 after the United States on its “Human Rights and Rule of Law” sub-indicator. Foreigners in Japan may face human-rights violations that Japanese citizens do not.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-japan-human-rights-agreement-criticized>Why was the Japan human rights agreement criticized?</h2>
<p>The agreement had been criticized by civil society organizations as well as historians for its failure to provide a fully victim-centred approach and to provide an official, unequivocal recognition of responsibility by Japan for serious human rights violations committed by its military against women and girls before and during World War II.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-freedom-of-speech-does-japan-have>What kind of freedom of speech does Japan have?</h2>
<p>Freedom of speech and of the press. The Japanese Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press. In theory, an independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press.</p>
