<h2 id=what-radical-republicans-wanted>What Radical Republicans wanted?</h2>
<p>Radical Republican, during and after the American Civil War, a member of the Republican Party committed to emancipation of the slaves and later to the equal treatment and enfranchisement of the freed blacks.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-radical-republicans-and-what-did-they-want-from-the-confederate-states>Who were the Radical Republicans and what did they want from the Confederate states?</h2>
<p>Most Republicans were Northerners who supported the abolition of slavery. Before the American Civil War (1861–65) broke out in 1861, the Radical Republicans were determined to prevent the spread of slavery into new territories.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-radical-republicans-do-to-protect-african-american-rights>What did the Radical Republicans do to protect African American rights?</h2>
<p>The Republicans — then dubbed radical Republicans — managed to enact a series of constitutional amendments and reconstruction acts granting legal equality to former slaves — and giving them access to federal courts if their rights were violated. The 13th Amendment, which was ratified in 1865, abolished slavery.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-the-radical-republicans-opposed-to-lincolns-plan-what-did-the-radical-republicans-want>Why were the Radical Republicans opposed to Lincoln’s plan What did the Radical Republicans want?</h2>
<p>Congress Responds The Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln’s plan because they thought it too lenient toward the South. Radical Republicans believed that Lincoln’s plan for Reconstruction was not harsh enough because, from their point of view, the South was guilty of starting the war and deserved to be punished as such.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-radicals-want-after-the-civil-war>What did the radicals want after the Civil War?</h2>
<p>Radicals pushed for the uncompensated abolition of slavery, while Lincoln wanted to pay slave owners who were loyal to the Union. After the war, the Radicals demanded civil rights for freed slaves, including measures ensuring suffrage.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-radicals-want-for-the-reconstruction-plan>What did the radicals want for the reconstruction plan?</h2>
<p>The Radicals passed their own Reconstruction plan through Congress in 1864, but Lincoln vetoed it and was putting his own policies in effect as military commander-in-chief when he was assassinated in April 1865. Radicals pushed for the uncompensated abolition of slavery, while Lincoln wanted to pay slave owners who were loyal to the Union.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-radicals-in-congress>Who was the leader of the radicals in Congress?</h2>
<p>The leading Radicals in Congress were Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Charles Sumner in the Senate. Grant was elected as a Republican in 1868 and after the election he generally sided with the Radicals on Reconstruction policies and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1871 into law.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-radicals-want-in-the-1930s>What did the radicals want in the 1930s?</h2>
<p>The argument, common in the 1930s, that the Radicals were primarily motivated by a desire to selfishly promote Northeastern business interests, has seldom been argued by historians for a half-century. On foreign policy issues, the Radicals and moderates generally did not take distinctive positions.</p>
