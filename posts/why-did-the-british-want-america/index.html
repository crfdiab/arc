<h2 id=why-did-the-british-want-america>Why did the British want America?</h2>
<p>England also looked at the settlement of colonies as a way of fulfilling its desire to sell more goods and resources to other countries than it bought. At the same time, the colonists could be a market for England’s manufactured goods. The English knew that establishing colonies was an expensive and risky business.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-british-lose-to-the-americans>Did the British lose to the Americans?</h2>
<p>Prof. WEINTRAUB: Britain lost the war because General Washington had two other generals on his side. By the time the Donald Rumsfeld of that war, the secretary for America, Lord George Germaine, sent his orders across to America 3,000 miles away, it was too late; the orders were moot.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-not-leave-america>Why did the British not leave America?</h2>
<p>Above all, they resented the taxes and duties that the British put on to the goods they traded. They felt that if the colonies paid taxes, they should be represented in Parliament. King George refused and the discontent increased. The British did not leave North America, however.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-the-british-empire-have-on-america>What impact did the British Empire have on America?</h2>
<p>As the British Empire expanded there became a growing independence movement amongst American colonialists. In 1776, thirteen American colonies joined together to form the United States of America and declare themselves independent from Britain.</p>
<h2 id=does-england-rule-america>Does England rule America?</h2>
<p>British America comprised the colonial territories of the British Empire in America from 1607 to 1783. At the start of the Revolutionary War in 1775, the British Empire included 23 colonies and territories on the North American continent.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-british-are-coming-take-place>When did the British are coming take place?</h2>
<p>“The British Are Coming” is the first volume in a planned trilogy on the American Revolution that will match his Liberation Trilogy on World War II. It covers all the major battles and skirmishes from the spring of 1775 to the winter of 1776-77.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-british-are-coming-a-good-book>Is the British are coming a good book?</h2>
<p>“The British Are Coming” is a major addition to that ongoing argument. A powerful new voice has been added to the dialogue about our origins as a people and a nation. It is difficult to imagine any reader putting this beguiling book down without a smile and a tear.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-us-gain-its-independence-from-britain>When did the US gain its independence from Britain?</h2>
<p>In 1775, war broke out between the British and the American colonists. By 1776, the colonists had declared themselves independent and in 1783, following a prolonged and bloody war, Britain was forced to recognise the independence of the United States. Was American independence inevitable?</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-give-up-the-war-in-1776>Why did the British give up the war in 1776?</h2>
<p>Some, though, blamed the British government for what was happening, and willed their leaders to give up and abandon the war with the Americans. On Sept. 7, 1776, Stephen Sayre of Harley Street, London, wrote to the Duke of Portland urging him and others to come to a meeting to figure out how to cut Britain’s losses.</p>
