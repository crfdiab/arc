<h2 id=how-will-volcano-eruption-affect-us>How will volcano eruption affect us?</h2>
<p>Volcanoes spew hot, dangerous gases, ash, lava, and rock that are powerfully destructive. Health concerns after a volcanic eruption include infectious disease, respiratory illness, burns, injuries from falls, and vehicle accidents related to the slippery, hazy conditions caused by ash.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-volcanic-eruptions-affect-society-brainly>How do volcanic eruptions affect society Brainly?</h2>
<p>Answer: VOLCANIC ERUPTION IS A PHENOMENA THAT CAN AFFECT THE SOCIETY THE LAVA FLOWS CAN WIPE OUTS THE FLANK OF HABITAT AND COMMUNITIES. IT CAN HARM THE OTHER LIVING ORGANISM SUCH AS ANIMALS AND PLANTS. IT CAN HARM A LARGE AMOUNT OF VICTIMS IN THE SOCIETY.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-volcanic-eruption-affect-the-economy>How does a volcanic eruption affect the economy?</h2>
<p>Volcanoes serve as tourist attractions, bringing in money for the local economy. Volcanic ash acts as a natural fertiliser for the soil, which is good for growing crops. Geothermal energy can be generated in places where the crust is thinner and so volcanic areas can be used to harness renewable energy.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-long-term-effects-that-an-explosive-volcanic-eruption-may-cause-brainly>What are some long term effects that an explosive volcanic eruption may cause Brainly?</h2>
<p>Answer: roof collapse in built-up areas—a local effect out to distances where ash fall is a few centimetres thick (hundreds of kilometres from the volcano). Exacerbated if rain occurs or ash fall is wet.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantage-of-volcano>What are the disadvantage of volcano?</h2>
<p>Disadvantages: Sea – during a volcanic eruption earthquakes happen, and tsunamis may be created. Also, if it is a volcanic island, the island may be destroyed, and there is no escape. The ash from a volcano can suffocate people and the lava can burn people. Volcanoes can also cause earthquakes.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-political-impacts-of-volcanic-eruptions>What are the political impacts of volcanic eruptions?</h2>
<p>It is very expensive for the government. The people are all depending on/counting on the government. The governments buildings and roads get destroyed which costs a lot of money to rebuild. The government cannot get through to helping all of the hurt.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-eruption-of-a-volcano-affect-society>How does the eruption of a volcano affect society?</h2>
<p>HOW DO VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AFFECT SOCIETY? Explosive volcanic eruptions pose both short-term and long-term hazards. Lava flows and lahars can wipe out the flanks of mountainsides. Volcanic ash can blanket the landscape for miles, and ash clouds can disrupt aircraft travel</p>
<h2 id=how-are-volcanoes-good-or-bad-for-society>How are volcanoes good or bad for society?</h2>
<p>Some of the good ways that volcanoes affect people include producing spectacular scenery, and producing very rich soils for farming. Volcanoes affect people in many ways, some are good, some are not. Some of the bad ways are that houses, buildings, roads, and fields can get covered with ash.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-ash-from-a-volcano-affect-the-earth>How does the ash from a volcano affect the Earth?</h2>
<p>Although volcanoes are almost exclusively associated with disasters, they also positively contribute to Earth’s health. For example, volcanic ashes are natural fertilizers for plants and soil and they contain beneficial minerals. By creating air space in the soil, volcanic ash insulates plants and acts like a shield against temperature changes.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-volcanic-eruptions-affect-the-society-by-mel-dianne>How are volcanic eruptions affect the society by Mel Dianne?</h2>
<p>The distance you have to evacuate depends entirely on what kind of eruption is going on. For example, Pinatubo, one of the largest recent eruptions sent pyroclastic flows at least 18 km down its flanks, and pumice falls were hot and heavy even beyond that. For example, pumice 7 cm across fell at Clark Air base which is 25 km from the volcano!</p>
