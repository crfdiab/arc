<h2 id=what-were-aboriginal-digging-sticks-used-for>What were Aboriginal digging sticks used for?</h2>
<p>Digging sticks are hand crafted wooden implements, sharpened at one end, which the Aboriginal women use to dig for edible bush tucker (roots, tubers, honey ants, reptiles). In womens ceremonies they are used as clapping sticks.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-aboriginal-weapons-made-of>What were aboriginal weapons made of?</h2>
<p>Australian Aborigines manufactured a range of tools, utensils, fighting weapons, and hunting weapons made from the available resources of wood, bone and shell. Wooden tools and utensils included: Chisels and scrapers (stone pieces) hafted to long wooden handles. (See the section on stone tools.)</p>
<h2 id=how-is-a-coolamon-made>How is a coolamon made?</h2>
<p>Coolamons are generally made by the men. They are usually made from a hardwood such as mallee. In Central Australia, the bean tree was often used. A piece of the outer bark of the tree is removed, then moulded over the fire to give it its distinctive curved sides.</p>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-wood-is-a-digging-stick-made-of>What kind of wood is a digging stick made of?</h2>
<p>The digging stick consists of a dark-brown, relatively heavy wood (Casuarina equisetifolia), which may also originally have been very hard, the patina of which even today shines like varnish.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-digging-stick>What was the purpose of the digging stick?</h2>
<p>The stick may also have other uses in hunting or general domestic tasks. They are common to the Indigenous Australians but also other peoples worldwide. The tool normally consists of little more than a sturdy stick which has been shaped or sharpened and sometimes hardened by being placed temporarily in a fire.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-digging-sticks-are-used-in-ethiopia>What kind of digging sticks are used in Ethiopia?</h2>
<p>Since contact with the Europeans in the 19th century, Native Americans have also adapted the use of a metal in making digging sticks. The most common digging stick found in Ethiopia is the ankassay in Amharic, a Semitic language spoken in Ethiopia and the second-most spoken Semitic language in the world.</p>
