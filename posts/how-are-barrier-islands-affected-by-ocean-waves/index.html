<h2 id=how-are-barrier-islands-affected-by-ocean-waves>How are barrier islands affected by ocean waves?</h2>
<p>Barrier islands are made of sandy, erodible soil and subject to high-energy wave action. And over time many barrier islands move landward, toward the shore. This typically happens because local sea levels rise, so waves wash over the islands during storms, moving sand from the ocean side to the inland side.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-barrier-island-in-the-ocean>What is a barrier island in the ocean?</h2>
<p>A barrier island is a constantly changing deposit of sand that forms parallel to the coast. Beaches and sand dune systems form on the side of the island facing the ocean; the side facing the shore often contains marshes, tidal flats, and maritime forests.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-barrier-islands-maintained>How are barrier islands maintained?</h2>
<p>These barriers are maintained primarily by internally generated wind waves rather than open ocean waves. Consequently, secondary barriers are generally smaller and more ephemeral than barriers along the open coast.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-causes-of-barrier-island-movement>What is the causes of barrier island movement?</h2>
<p>Barrier islands form in three ways. They can form from spits, from drowned dune ridges or from sand bars. Longshore drift is the movement of sand parallel to the shore caused by the angle of the waves breaking on the beach. When a storm such as a hurricane digs an inlet through the spit a barrier island is formed.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-barrier-island>What are the disadvantages of barrier island?</h2>
<p>The disadvantage of the barrier island shoreline is exposed to many threats, such as storm erosion, reductions in sediment longshore drift and sea level rise. Many of these threats to coastal areas, such as Ria Formosa, are likely to increase in the near future…</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-ocean-side-of-a-barrier-island-work>How does the ocean side of a barrier island work?</h2>
<p>On the ocean side is the barrier island’s beach habitat. The beach is much like a desert in that it lacks fresh water, but a large portion of the beach gets covered almost entirely with salt water twice daily (the entire beach gets covered to the dune base during storms).</p>
<h2 id=what-can-be-done-to-conserve-barrier-islands>What can be done to conserve barrier islands?</h2>
<p>However, there are some ways to help conserve barrier islands while maintaining areas for tourism activities. First, federal, state and local laws can reduce incentives to build on barrier islands by putting the burden of rebuilding after storms on owners, not on the government.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-beach-recovery-work-on-barrier-island>How does beach recovery work on barrier island?</h2>
<p>Beach recovery initiates as the storm energy subsides, generally in the morphologic form of ridge and runnel development. Continued beach recovery includes increased elevation of the ridge crest, that is, growth of beach berm, and overwash deposits in the runnel, eventually welding the ridge. Patrick Barrineau.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-does-a-barrier-island-have-to-be>How tall does a barrier island have to be?</h2>
<p>A barrier island is a narrow strip of sandy beach, with or without vegetation, that forms an offshore island less than 20 ft above sea level separated from the main shoreline by a narrow lagoon or marsh area that lies roughly at sea level, followed by the mainland, which can rise fairly quickly to between 10 and 50 ft above sea level.</p>
