<h2 id=how-does-water-scarcity-affect-brazil>How does water scarcity affect Brazil?</h2>
<p>Lack of access to improved water and sanitation disrupts the socioeconomic development of the country and has significant implications on health. Brazil ranks higher than average, globally, on infant death mortality and hospitalizations of adults and children.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-water-important-in-brazil>Why is water important in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Water is also essential for agriculture, another important sector of the country’s economy. According to the National Water Agency (ANA), irrigation consumes 72% of Brazil’s water supply.</p>
<h2 id=is-brazil-water-stressed>Is Brazil water Stressed?</h2>
<p>Brazil’s water resources and population are very unevenly distributed. The Amazon River basin contains roughly 50 percent of the country’s water, but only 4 percent of its population. Many of these cities are water stressed, due to their rapid growth and development.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-brazil-treat-water>How does Brazil treat water?</h2>
<p>Urban coverage is 100% for water and 85% for improved sanitation, including 53% access to sewerage, the remainder being accounted for by on-site sanitation. Coverage in rural areas, where 13% of Brazil’s population lives, is much lower. It stands at 85% for improved water supply and only 44% for improved sanitation.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-major-problems-in-sao-paulo>What are the 3 major problems in Sao Paulo?</h2>
<p>The biggest is São Paulo, which faces major challenges of traffic, pollution, crime, waste and rising property prices as a result of a growing middle class. “We need more just cities.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-quality-of-water-in-brazil>How is the quality of water in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Brazil ranks higher than average, globally, on infant death mortality and hospitalizations of adults and children. These rankings are linked, at least in part, to a severe lack of access to improved water and sanitation services.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-affected-by-the-water-crisis-in-brazil>Who is affected by the water crisis in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Like 25 million Brazilians, Maria lacked access to adequate sanitation in her home, where she lives and works and helps raise her granddaughter. Read about how a small loan gave this mother and grandmother the resource needed to keep her family healthy.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-water-in-rio-de-janeiro-bad>How is the water in Rio de Janeiro bad?</h2>
<p>Foreigners are not the only ones wary of the water in Rio de Janeiro’s Guanabara Bay. Locals know to not even dip their toes in, aware that they will likely get a disease from the sickening waters. It has been reported to contain high levels of bacteria and viruses that could likely lead to stomach and respiratory illnesses.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-sharing-of-water-in-brazil>How is the sharing of water in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Sharing water harmoniously and peacefully is an art as well as a science. In Brazil, there are successful experiences of sharing water that have these characteristics and deserve to be better known and disseminated. There are many examples of good practices based on shared quality information among the various water users of a river or a reservoir.</p>
