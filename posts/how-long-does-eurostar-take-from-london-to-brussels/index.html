<p>1hr 53mins<br>
How long is the Eurostar train journey from London to Brussels? Typically, the train journey from London to Brussels takes 1hr 53mins.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-train-from-uk-to-belgium>Is there a train from UK to Belgium?</h2>
<p>The Eurostar, which opened back in 1994, has been connecting the United Kingdom with mainland Europe for over two decades. Trains depart from London’s St Pancras International Station and stop at Brussels Midi station, with the fastest to Brussels taking just 1 hour and 48 minutes.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-train-from-belgium-to-uk>How long is train from Belgium to UK?</h2>
<p>2 hours and 13 minutes<br>
The average journey time by train between Brussels and London is 2 hours and 13 minutes, with around 1 train per day.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-check-bags-on-eurostar>Do you check bags on Eurostar?</h2>
<p>Luggage allowance On Eurostar there’s no weight limit for your luggage, but you should be able carry and lift your bags safely. Each bag can be up to 85cm long at its widest point. There’s no restriction on liquids so you can take your favourite toiletries or even bring back some Parisian perfume.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-need-a-visa-for-belgium-from-uk>Do I need a visa for Belgium from UK?</h2>
<p>Who needs a visa to travel to Belgium from the UK? Any UK citizen who holds either a full UK passport or a BOTC, BOC, BPP or BS passport can travel to Belgium visa-free. However, many non-EU nationals who reside in the UK are still required to get a Schengen visa to travel to Belgium.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-get-from-belgium-to-england>How do you get from Belgium to England?</h2>
<p>There is currently just the 1 ferry route running between Belgium and England operated by 1 ferry company – P&O Ferries. The Zeebrugge to Hull ferry crossing operates weekly with a scheduled sailing duration from about 14 hours 30 minutes.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-take-food-in-my-suitcase-on-eurostar>Can I take food in my suitcase on Eurostar?</h2>
<p>1. Re: Can I take food in my luggage on Eurostar? There are no restrictions on what food items you can put in your bag.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-you-put-your-suitcase-on-the-eurostar>Where do you put your suitcase on the Eurostar?</h2>
<p>You take your bags into the train with you and put them on the rack above your seat, or in the space between the seat backs, or on floor-standing racks at the car ends or in the seating area. On local & regional trains you usually just stick bags on the floor. There’s usually no separate baggage car on European trains.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-train-tickets-from-london-to-belgium>Are there any train tickets from London to Belgium?</h2>
<p>Any Belgian Station tickets take you right through from London on one ticket. It’s up to you where you go – just hop on a local train when you get to Brussels and go exploring.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-train-from-london-to-brussels>How long is the train from London to Brussels?</h2>
<p>Eurostar high-speed trains from London to Brussels can travel at speeds of up to around 186 mph (300 km/h) when on land. When travelling through the Channel Tunnel (also known as the Chunnel), train speed is reduced to around 100 mph (160 km/h). The fastest journey time from London to Brussels by train is 1 hour and 56 minutes.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-train-from-bruges-to-brussels>How long is the train from Bruges to Brussels?</h2>
<p>In the inwards direction you need to allow for the 30 minute Eurostar check-in, and it’s sensible to allow for the Belgian domestic train to be a little late too, so I’d allow at least 50 minutes between the Belgian train arriving and your Eurostar departure time.</p>
