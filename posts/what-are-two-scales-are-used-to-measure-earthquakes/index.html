<h2 id=what-are-two-scales-are-used-to-measure-earthquakes>What are two scales are used to measure earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Two of the most common methods used to measure earthquakes are the Richter scale and the moment magnitude scale.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-magnitude-of-an-earthquake-calculated>How is the magnitude of an earthquake calculated?</h2>
<p>A Richter magnitude is calculated based on the amplitude of the largest seismic wave recorded for the earthquake. The Richter scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, meaning that there is no limit to how small or large the earthquake must be to be measured by the scale. The Richter scale runs from 1 to 10,…</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-smallest-earthquake-on-the-richter-scale>Which is the smallest earthquake on the Richter scale?</h2>
<p>The Richter scale runs from 1 to 10, with 1 being the smallest and 10 being the largest. Because the Richter scale is logarithmic, a 5.0 earthquake measures 10 times the shaking amplitude than one that measures 4.0, for example.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-seismic-waves-measured-and-how-are-they-measured>How are seismic waves measured and how are they measured?</h2>
<p>Seismograms record seismic waves. Over the past century, scientists have developed several ways of measuring earthquake intensity. The currently accepted method is the moment magnitude scale, which measures the total amount of energy released by the earthquake.</p>

<h2 id=when-was-the-first-earthquake-magnitude-scale-created>When was the first earthquake magnitude scale created?</h2>
<p>The first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes, developed in 1935 by Charles F. Richter and popularly known as the “Richter” scale, is actually the Local magnitude scale, label ML or M L. Richter established two features now common to all magnitude scales.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-magnitude-of-an-earthquake-on-the-richter-scale>What is the magnitude of an earthquake on the Richter scale?</h2>
<p>On the Richter Scale, magnitude is expressed in whole numbers and decimal fractions. For example, a magnitude of 5.3 might be computed for a moderate earthquake, and a strong earthquake might be rated as magnitude 6.3.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-magnitude-of-an-earthquake-related-to-its-strength>How is the magnitude of an earthquake related to its strength?</h2>
<p>Magnitude is an estimate of the relative “size” or strength of an earthquake, and thus its potential for causing ground-shaking. It is “approximately related to the released seismic energy.” Isoseismal map for the 1968 Illinois earthquake. The irregular distribution of shaking arises from variations of geology and/or ground conditions.</p>

<h2 id=when-was-the-first-earthquake-measured-on-the-richter-scale>When was the first earthquake measured on the Richter scale?</h2>
<p>For earthquakes that occurred between about 1890 (when modern seismographs came into use) and 1935 when Charles Richter developed the magnitude scale, people went back to the old records and compared the seismograms from those days with similar records for later earthquakes. For earthquakes prior to about 1890, magnitudes have been estimated by…</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-magnitude-of-an-earthquake-determined>How is the magnitude of an earthquake determined?</h2>
<p>An earthquake has one magnitude. The magnitude do not depend on where the measurement is made. Often, several slightly different magnitudes are reported for an earthquake. This happens because the relation between the seismic measurements and the…</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-logarithmic-earthquake-magnitude-scale-invented>When was the logarithmic earthquake magnitude scale invented?</h2>
<p>The idea of a logarithmic earthquake magnitude scale was first developed by Charles Richter in the 1930’s for measuring the size of earthquakes occurring in southern California using relatively high-frequency data from nearby seismograph stations.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-an-earthquake-on-the-richter-scale>How big is an earthquake on the Richter scale?</h2>
<p>The Richter Magnitude Scale. It measures the amplitude of the waves caused by an earthquake and from them assesses the earthquake’s strength and size. It is logarithmic, so a magnitude of 7 is ten times greater than a magnitude of 6, for example. Anything much over 6, particularly if near urban areas, will make the news.</p>
<p>Years ago, all magnitude scales were based on the recorded waveform lengths or the length of a seismic wave from one peak to the next. But for very large earthquakes, some magnitudes underestimated the true earthquake size.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-richter-scale-the-same-as-the-mercalli-scale>Is the Richter scale the same as the Mercalli scale?</h2>
<p>There are multiple different earthquake scales measuring things from intensity to damage. The Richter Scale is a logarithmic scale, measuring the scale of the earthquake based on recordings from seismographs. The Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale measures the shaking produced by the earthquake.</p>

<h2 id=how-are-earthquake-magnitudes-measured-by-the-usgs>How are earthquake magnitudes measured by the USGS?</h2>
<p>The USGS currently reports earthquake magnitudes using the Moment Magnitude scale, though many other magnitudes are calculated for research and comparison purposes. Intensity is a measure of the shaking and damage caused by the earthquake; this value changes from location to location.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-richter-scale-still-used-for-earthquakes>Is the Richter scale still used for earthquakes?</h2>
<p>You have probably heard of the Richter scale which is still used for small earthquakes, but most large earthquakes are now commonly reported using the moment magnitude scale(see below). Richter scale</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload" data-no-lazy=1 data-origheight=433 data-origwidth=770 data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll height=433 id=_ytid_31418 loading=lazy src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hLENDz3sFuM?enablejsapi=1&autoplay=0&cc_load_policy=0&cc_lang_pref=&iv_load_policy=1&loop=0&modestbranding=0&rel=1&fs=1&playsinline=0&autohide=2&theme=dark&color=red&controls=1&" title="YouTube player" width=770></iframe>
<p>A Richter scale is normally numbered 1-10, though there is no upper limit. It is logarithmic which means, for example, that an earthquake measuring magnitude 5 is ten times more powerful than an earthquake measuring 4. Earthquakes measuring 1-2 on the scale happen regularly, and they are so small that people cannot feel them.</p>

<h2 id=how-are-earthquakes-measured-in-a-seismic-network>How are earthquakes measured in a seismic network?</h2>
<p>Each seismic station in the network measures the movement of the ground at that site. The slip of one block of rock over another in an earthquake releases energy that makes the ground vibrate.</p>

<h2 id=is-the-richter-scale-the-same-size-as-an-earthquake>Is the Richter scale the same size as an earthquake?</h2>
<p>It is a measure of the size of the earthquake source and is the same number no matter where you are or what the shaking feels like. The Richter scale is an outdated method for measuring magnitude that is no longer used by the USGS for large, teleseismic earthquakes.</p>
