<h2 id=why-can-we-see-the-sun-from-earth>Why can we see the Sun from Earth?</h2>
<p>This is because of the refraction of the light from the Sun by the Earth’s atmosphere–the Earth’s atmosphere bends the path of the light so that we see the Sun in a position slightly different from where it really is.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-earth-look-from-sun>How does Earth look from sun?</h2>
<p>Earth is the bright spot near the center of the right-hand image. (The bow-shaped brightness below is just an artifact of how imaging technology designed to work inside the sun’s atmosphere responds to an individual, particularly bright spot, according to a NASA statement.)</p>
<h2 id=can-earth-become-sun>Can Earth become sun?</h2>
<p>By that point, all life on the Earth will be extinct. The most probable fate of the planet is absorption by the Sun in about 7.5 billion years, after the star has entered the red giant phase and expanded beyond the planet’s current orbit.</p>
<h2 id=what-keeps-the-earth-from-going-into-the-sun>What keeps the Earth from going into the Sun?</h2>
<p>Answer 1: The Earth is always being pulled towards the Sun by gravity. The Earth is not moving fast enough to “escape” the Sun’s gravity and leave the solar system, but it is going too fast to be pulled into the Sun. Therefore, it keeps going around and around – orbiting the Sun.</p>
<h2 id=why-can-you-see-the-sun-from-space>Why can you see the Sun from space?</h2>
<p>The reason we can see the sun and stars from Earth is due to the GROSS MATTER of the atmosphere envelope. The only reason you can see the moon or Earth from FREE SPACE, is because they are GROSS MATTER and they make the light by reflecting certain frequency photons which are emitted by the sun.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-sun-appear-different-from-the-earth>Why does the sun appear different from the Earth?</h2>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-see-the-sun-from-earth>Is it possible to see the Sun from Earth?</h2>
<p>However the Sun is a dynamic, constantly changing ball of fusion and by the time we see the other side, the entire surface has evolved and changed. And with our ever-increasing dependence on satellite technology, the problem of solar flares and coronal mass ejections is one that concerns scientists and engineers.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-we-see-the-far-side-of-the-sun>How often do we see the far side of the Sun?</h2>
<p>However there is no ‘far side of the Sun’. Unlike the Moon, which spins once for every time it goes around the Earth, constantly presenting us with the same side, the Sun spins once every 24.5 days and the Earth moves within its orbit so that over the course of about a month we get to see the entire surface.</p>
