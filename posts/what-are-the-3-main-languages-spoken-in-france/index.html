<h2 id=what-was-frances-first-language>What was France’s first language?</h2>
<p>French<br>
BBC – Languages – Languages. French, the official language, is the first language of 88% of the population. Most of those who speak minority languages also speak French, as the minority languages are given no legal recognition.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-communicate-in-new-france>How did people communicate in New France?</h2>
<p>In New France, the energy of wind and currents, draught animals, or human beings working oars was the only way of providing means of travel for people, goods and information. To send a letter from Versailles to Detroit, for example, first it had to be sent by horse or carriage to the ports of La Rochelle or Bordeaux.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-languages-are-spoken-in-france>How many languages are spoken in France?</h2>
<p>Linguists estimate that there are around 75 regional languages in France! Some of these are taught in schools, including Occitan, Breton, Basque, Corsican, Alsatian and certain Melanesian languages such as Tahitian. Every year, 400,000 pupils learn a regional language in France’s state-run and private schools.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-religion-in-france>What is the religion in France?</h2>
<p>Roman Catholic Church<br>
Religion of France About three-fifths of the French people belong to the Roman Catholic Church. Only a minority, however, regularly participate in religious worship; practice is greatest among the middle classes.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-popular-foods-eaten-in-new-france>What were popular foods eaten in New France?</h2>
<p>Pork and smoked hams were a preferred meat in the region. They also ate beef and domestic fowl as well as game, such as deer, bison, squirrel, bear, duck, and goose. Catfish was especially favored. Meat and vegetables were usually combined in soups, fricassees, and gumbos (derived from African cooking).</p>
<h2 id=did-the-french-have-a-good-relationship-with-the-natives>Did the French have a good relationship with the natives?</h2>
<p>The land-hungry English settlers would ignore agreements, leading to conflict. By contrast, the French generally developed strong, mutually respectful relationships with their Native American neighbors. They took advantage of these relationships during conflicts with their European foes.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-speak-english-in-paris>Can I speak English in Paris?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can speak English in Paris as most people in Paris speak the language. However, while you can simply get by with just English in Paris, have an interest and put in efforts to know French to a decent extent. I’ll advise that you do this especially if you’ll be staying in Paris for long.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-other-languages-spoken-in-france>Are there any other languages spoken in France?</h2>
<p>There are also several languages spoken in France’s overseas areas (see Administrative divisions of France for details): French Sign Language is also recognised as a language of France (with at least one regional variant in Provence).</p>
<h2 id=where-do-the-occitan-dialects-of-france-come-from>Where do the Occitan dialects of France come from?</h2>
<p>They belong to the Gallo-Romance group which also includes the French language. The Occitan dialects are a part of the Romance family of languages and they are spoken in Southern France. The name is derived from lenga d’ac (òc is the word for “yes” in the language).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-french-become-the-official-language-of-france>When did French become the official language of France?</h2>
<p>Additionally, France has a number of territories and regions around the world, with a total population of 2.13 million. French has been the official language of France since 1992, but has been the country’s administrative language for legal documents and laws since 1539.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-language-spoken-in-france-catalan-or-breton>Which is language spoken in France, Catalan or Breton?</h2>
<p>Catalan is also spoken in France. But only a small number of people in France’s Catalan area actually speak Catalan, which is the result of language shift. Breton is spoken by about 200,000 people; its use is on the wane. Still, some 15,000 children learned Breton in 2013. This is a sign that speakers of Breton want very much to keep it alive.</p>
