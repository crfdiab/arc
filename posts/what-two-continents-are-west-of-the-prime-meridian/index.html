Antarctica is in both the Western & Eastern Hemispheres. Which two continents are both east and west of the prime meridian?</h2>
<p>This geography fact also means that Africa is the only continent to have land both at the Equator and the Prime Meridian. These two maps show how the continent of Africa lies in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and the Western and Eastern Hemispheres.</p>

<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-continent-east-of-the-prime-meridian>Which is the largest continent east of the prime meridian?</h2>
<p>The large continent is located primarily east of the prime meridian and west of the antimeridian. The only part of Asia outside the Eastern Hemisphere is a small portion of Russia, at the eastern end of the continent. The Indian Ocean is ranked as the world’s third largest ocean.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-prime-meridian-pass-through-africa>Where does the prime meridian pass through Africa?</h2>
<p>The prime meridian passes through West Africa, excluding a small portion of the continent from the Eastern Hemisphere. Some of the African countries the line passes through are Algeria, Burkina Faso, Togo, Mali, and Ghana. Europe is Earth’s second smallest continent in terms of land area.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-prime-meridian-in-the-uk>Where is the Prime Meridian in the UK?</h2>
<p>Countries on the Prime Meridian. The Prime Meridian marked in Greenwich, United Kingdom. The Prime Meridian is an imaginary south/north longitude line that divides the planet into two. The Prime Meridian stretches from the South Pole and passes through Greenwich’s Royal Observatory in England to the North Pole.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-location-of-a-prime-meridian-measured>How is the location of a prime meridian measured?</h2>
<p>With a prime meridian, locations on Earth would be measured by their distance to the east or the west of the prime meridian line. Then, based on that distance and where the location was on a map, the current time would either increase or decrease as one would travel east or west.</p>
