<h2 id=what-causes-surface-circulation>What causes surface circulation?</h2>
<p>Surface currents in the ocean are driven by global wind systems that are fueled by energy from the sun. Patterns of surface currents are determined by wind direction, Coriolis forces from the Earth’s rotation, and the position of landforms that interact with the currents.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-surface-circulation-work>How does surface circulation work?</h2>
<p>Near the shore, surface currents are driven by both the wind and tides, which draw water back and forth as the water level falls and rises. Meanwhile, in the open ocean, wind is the major force behind surface currents. As wind blows over the ocean, it drags the top layers of water along with it.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-surface-circulation-patterns>What are surface circulation patterns?</h2>
<p>Gyres Surface water circulates in oceans in massive circular patterns called gyres. The major surface currents (eastern boundary, western boundary, and equatorial current) in each ocean link to form a circle. Gyres are clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-surface-circulation-driven-by>What is surface circulation driven by?</h2>
<p>The circulation of the surface ocean is driven primarily by surface winds. As we have seen, winds blow from areas of high atmospheric pressure to regions of low atmospheric pressure.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-deep-circulation>What is deep circulation?</h2>
<p>Currents Tutorial Winds drive ocean currents in the upper 100 meters of the ocean’s surface. These deep-ocean currents are driven by differences in the water’s density, which is controlled by temperature (thermo) and salinity (haline). This process is known as thermohaline circulation.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-surface-water-circulation>What is surface water circulation?</h2>
<p>Surface circulation carries the warm upper waters poleward from the tropics. Heat is disbursed along the way from the waters to the atmosphere. At the poles, the water is further cooled during winter, and sinks to the deep ocean. This is especially true in the North Atlantic and along Antarctica.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-term-circulation-come-from-in-physics>Where does the term circulation come from in physics?</h2>
<p>In fluid dynamics, circulation is the line integral of the velocity field, around a closed curve. Circulation is normally denoted Γ ( Greek uppercase gamma ). Circulation was first used independently by Frederick Lanchester, Martin Kutta and Nikolai Zhukovsky .</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-surface-circulation-of-the-mediterranean-sea>How is the surface circulation of the Mediterranean Sea?</h2>
<p>Surface circulation of the Mediterranean consists basically of a separate counterclockwise movement of the water in each of the two basins. Because of the complexity of the northern coastline and of the numerous islands, many small eddies and other local currents form essential parts of….</p>
<h2 id=what-does-langmuir-circulation-mean-in-oceanography>What does Langmuir circulation mean in oceanography?</h2>
<p>In physical oceanography, Langmuir circulation consists of a series of shallow, slow, counter-rotating vortices at the ocean’s surface aligned with the wind.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-circulation-of-air-affect-the-earth>How does the circulation of air affect the Earth?</h2>
<p>Atmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air, and together with ocean circulation is the means by which thermal energy is redistributed on the surface of the Earth . The Earth’s atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the large-scale structure of its circulation remains fairly constant.</p>
