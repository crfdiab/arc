<h2 id=why-was-the-great-barrier-reef-formed>Why was the Great Barrier Reef formed?</h2>
<p>Coral reefs form when pre-existing reefs release a burst of larva into the water. The larva will drift until they hit a hard surface such as submerged rocks, or edges of islands. The Great Barrier Reef is a barrier reef, which borders along the coast, separated from Australia by a lagoon of open water.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-barrier-reefs>What is the purpose of barrier reefs?</h2>
<p>Benefits of coral reef ecosystems Coral reefs protect coastlines from storms and erosion, provide jobs for local communities, and offer opportunities for recreation. They are also are a source of food and new medicines. Over half a billion people depend on reefs for food, income, and protection.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-great-barrier-reef-become-a-world-heritage-area>Why did the Great Barrier Reef become a World Heritage Area?</h2>
<p>Port development has been the major reason for coastal reclamation — infilling areas of ocean, wetlands or other water bodies — along the Great Barrier Reef coast. The total area reclaimed within the World Heritage Area since its listing in 1981 is approximately eight square kilometres.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-great-barrier-reef-a-natural-wonder>How is the Great Barrier Reef a natural wonder?</h2>
<p>The evolution of Australia’s great natural wonder. The history of the Great Barrier Reef is a long and diverse one, where many generations of coral have built a habitat that eventually was discovered and then later settled by humans. How was the Great Barrier Reef formed?</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-great-barrier-reef-in-square-kilometres>How big is the Great Barrier Reef in square kilometres?</h2>
<p>As the world’s most extensive coral reef ecosystem, the Great Barrier Reef is a globally outstanding and significant entity. Practically the entire ecosystem was inscribed as World Heritage in 1981, covering an area of 348,000 square kilometres and extending across a contiguous latitudinal range of 14o (10oS to 24oS).</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-the-great-barrier-reef-coral-reef>How old is the Great Barrier Reef coral reef?</h2>
<p>The Great Barrier Reef is an extremely ancient, enormous host of living things, composed of living coral growing on dead coral dating back perhaps as much as twenty million years.</p>
