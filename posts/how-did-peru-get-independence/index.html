<h2 id=when-did-peru-abolish-slavery>When did Peru abolish slavery?</h2>
<p>1854<br>
Despite opposition from local slave owners, José de San Martin – the ‘liberator’ of Peru – ordered that slave trade be abolished in 1821. Slavery itself, however, was not finally abolished until 1854.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-peru-achieve-its-independence-from-spain>When did Peru achieve its independence from Spain?</h2>
<p>Achievement of independence. The Napoleonic invasion of Spain in 1808 sparked the Creoles (those of European descent born in America) in other Spanish colonies to struggle for independence between 1810 and 1821.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-peruvian-war-of-independence>Who was involved in the Peruvian War of Independence?</h2>
<p>Peru eventually succumbed to patriot armies after the decisive continental campaigns of José de San Martín (1820–1823) and Simón Bolívar (1823–1825). Some of the early Spanish conquistadors that explored Peru made the first attempts for independence from the Spanish crown.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-peru-in-1821>Who was the leader of Peru in 1821?</h2>
<p>This allowed that Lima was at the mercy of the patriot army. José de San Martin entered triumphant to the capital on June 6, 1821. Later was proclaimed the independence of Peru, on July 28, 1821. San Martín established the Protectorate like government form.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-peru-remain-loyal-to-the-spanish>Why did Peru remain loyal to the Spanish?</h2>
<p>But Peru remained loyal because of the conservative attitude of the Peruvian aristocracy, the presence of many Spaniards in Peru, the concentration of Spanish military power in Lima, and the effective suppression of Indian uprisings. Peru’s independence was, consequently, achieved primarily by outsiders.</p>
