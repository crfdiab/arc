<p>Visit Nepal’s deepest Lake, the Rara, hiking through lovely Juniper forests and enjoy the spectacular landscape that surrounds this pristine lake. Rara Lake at 2,990m, is the deepest lake in Nepal and also one of the most pristine. Surrounded by green hills on all sides, covered in juniper trees, one can camp by the sparkling waters of the lake.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-highest-mountain-located-in-nepal>Which is the highest mountain located in Nepal?</h2>
<p>All of us knows that the highest mountain in the world – Mount Everest – lies in Nepal. While most of us can’t summit the mighty peak, a lot of people (over 30,000 per year) trek and reach the Everest South Base Camp that lies in the Khumbu region of Nepal.</p>

<p>Deep in Nepal’s Himalayas, the Kali Gandaki River has been flowing for millions of years, creating depths that are still somewhat unknown. There’s a strange fascination with all things deep and uncertain in the world, such as the previously unexplored depths of Mariana’s Trench and the perfectly carved layers of the Grand Canyon.</p>
