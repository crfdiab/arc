<h2 id=what-plate-is-under-the-north-american-plate>What plate is under the North American Plate?</h2>
<p>But the central part of the old Farallon plate vanished beneath North America. It was subducted beneath California leaving the San Andreas fault system behind as the contact between the North America and Pacific plates. The Juan de Fuca Plate is still actively subducting beneath N.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-plate-that-sinks-underneath-the-other-plate>What happens to the plate that sinks underneath the other plate?</h2>
<p>Where the oceanic lithosphere of a tectonic plate converges with the less dense lithosphere of a second plate, the heavier plate dives beneath the second plate and sinks into the mantle. A region where this process occurs is known as a subduction zone, and its surface expression is known as an arc-trench complex.</p>
<h2 id=what-plate-is-subducting-under-the-north-american-plate>What plate is subducting under the North American Plate?</h2>
<p>Juan de Fuca Plate<br>
One of the smallest of Earth’s tectonic plates, the Juan de Fuca Plate is a remnant part of the once-vast Farallon Plate, which is now largely subducted underneath the North American Plate.</p>
<h2 id=which-plate-would-sink-under-the-other>Which plate would sink under the other?</h2>
<p>At convergent boundaries, where plates push together, crust is either folded or destroyed. When two plates with continental crust collide, they will crumple and fold the rock between them. A plate with older, denser oceanic crust will sink beneath another plate.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-old-plate-sink-when-it-collides-with-a-new-plate>Why does old plate sink when it collides with a new plate?</h2>
<p>When two continental plates collide neither plate can be subducted due to their high bouyancy. After collision the oceanic lithosphere breaks off and sinks into the mantle. The subduction zone eventually becomes inactive The two continents become welded together as they are compressed together over time.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-pacific-plate-sink-under-the-north-american-plate>How does the Pacific Plate sink under the North American Plate?</h2>
<p>Here, the Pacific Plate sinks under the North American Plate in a process called subduction. As the Pacific Plate subducts, some pieces of the crust scrape off onto the North American Plate. However, most of the dense sinking plate gets pulled into the mantle where it melts into the surrounding material.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-north-american-plate-pulling-away-from-the-eurasian-plate>Is the North American plate pulling away from the Eurasian Plate?</h2>
<p>If you think back to the North American Plate’s major divergent plate boundary at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, we said that the North American Plate is continually pulling away from the Eurasian Plate. This means new rock is also being formed continually as the mantle material cools.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-the-interior-of-the-north-american-plate>How old is the interior of the North American Plate?</h2>
<p>During the time of Pangaea, the Farallon plate was largely responsible for pulling North America westward away from Europe and Africa. The interior of the North American plate contains a giant granitic craton. It’s believed that the North American (Laurentian) craton is 4 billion years old.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-the-north-american-plate-shift>How often does the North American plate shift?</h2>
<p>For example, the North American shifts just centimeters every year. Earth’s tectonic plate boundaries are strange because they often contain both continental and oceanic crust. For example, the North American major plate not only contains the continent of North America but also part of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
