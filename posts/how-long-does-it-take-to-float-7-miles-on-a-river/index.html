<p>A float trip can be as little as a few hours or as long as a week. The average trip is around 5-7 miles in distance and is generally considered an all-day float. The most convenient way to plan a trip is to go through a local rafting outfitter because they take care of all your floating needs.</p>

<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-float-a-river>How long does it take to float a river?</h2>
<p>One of our favorite outdoor activities to do as a family is float the river. It’s relaxing and fun. We typically float for half a day so somewhere between 3 – 5 hours. If you’ve never floated a river, it can be a little intimidating even though there’s no skill needed.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-float-the-santa-fe-river>How long does it take to float the Santa Fe River?</h2>
<p>The float trip is short, it only takes about 25 minutes. When you are done, it is a 5-minute walk on a paved sidewalk back to the start. The deepest part is about 5 feet and is much shallower in many places. In High Springs you can do a short float down the Santa Fe River at Ginnie Springs. Put in at Devil’s Spring and float for an hour.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-speed-of-a-river>What is the average speed of a river?</h2>
<p>The river speed is 4 mph. How about a little more complicated example where the numbers don’t divide nice and evenly. Let’s say the leaf floats past your 15-foot boat in 3 seconds. That’s 5 feet per second. One-third of 5 is about 1.7, and 1.7 x 2 = 3.4 mph.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-float-the-river-at-twin-spring>How long does it take to float the river at Twin Spring?</h2>
<p>Put in at Devil’s Spring and float for an hour. You will exit at Twin Spring and walk back to where you parked. It takes around 15 minutes to walk back on the tubing trail. There are free air stations located in the park.</p>
