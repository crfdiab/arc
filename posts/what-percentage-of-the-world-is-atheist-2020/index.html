<h2 id=what-is-the-most-atheist-state>What is the most atheist state?</h2>
<p>On a state level, it is not clear whether the least religious state resides in New England or the Western United States, as the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) ranked Vermont as the state with the highest percentage of residents claiming no religion at 34%, but a 2009 Gallup poll ranked Oregon as …</p>
<h2 id=is-france-an-atheist-country>Is France an atheist country?</h2>

<p>So how many people are we talking here? A lot. According to the latest international survey data, as reported by Ariela Keysar and Juhem Navarro-Rivera in the recently published Oxford Handbook of Atheism, there are approximately 450-500 million non-believers in God worldwide, which amounts to about 7% of the global adult population.</p>

<p>A negative perception of atheists and pressure from family and peers may also cause some atheists to disassociate themselves from atheism. Misunderstanding of the term may also be a reason some label themselves differently.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-atheists-in-the-1950s>What was life like for atheists in the 1950’s?</h2>
<p>Congregations at that time were few and far between. Commerce was the driving force that held the most common bond.
