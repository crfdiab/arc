<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-winter-rainfall-in-northern-pakistan>What are the disadvantages of winter rainfall in northern Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Explanation: Due to the rainfall in the winter season in Northern Pakistan, the floods will arise due to the over rainfall at that period.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-rain-important-for-agriculture>Why is rain important for agriculture?</h2>
<p>A good balance of rain and proper irrigation can lead to faster-growing plants, which can cut down on germination time and the length between seeding and harvest. The crops are dependent on water during their entire lifecycle in order to survive and thrive.</p>
<h2 id=in-which-area-there-is-high-rainfall-in-pakistan>In which area there is high rainfall in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Islamabad<br>
The highest rainfall of 620 millimetres (24 in) was recorded in Islamabad during 24 hours on 24 July 2001. The record-breaking rain fell in just 10 hours. It was the heaviest rainfall in Islamabad in the previous 100 years.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-problems-of-agriculture-in-pakistan>What are the problems of Agriculture in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>The marketing facilities for agricultural products in Pakistan are still far from satisfactory level. Our cultivators cannot get just prices for their produce due to defective marketing organization.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-too-much-rainfall-affect-crop-health>How does too much rainfall affect crop health?</h2>
<p>Too much watering could drown the crops, especially if there has been rainfall. However, a combination of not enough watering and no rainfall could also lead to dying crops. Underwatering “starves” the plant of water, which can lead to crop death or low yield.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-resources-needed-for-agriculture-in-pakistan>What are the resources needed for agriculture in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>The resources required for agricultural operation are land, layout, livestock, farm equipment, seeds, fertilizers, irrigation, transport etc. For the convenient and timely procurement of these resources the farmers must have easy access to credit.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-loss-of-agricultural-land-affecting-the-united-states>How is the loss of agricultural land affecting the United States?</h2>
<p>Loss of Agricultural Land. The trends in the loss of agricultural lands do not look promising for the future of agriculture in the United States. It is estimated that over 40 million hectares of agricultural land in the United States is in danger of being lost due to exposure to erosion by wind or water.</p>
