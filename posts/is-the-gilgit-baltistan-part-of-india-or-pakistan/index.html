<h2 id=is-the-gilgit-baltistan-part-of-india-or-pakistan>Is the Gilgit Baltistan part of India or Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Gilgit-Baltistan is part of the greater Kashmir region, which is the subject of a long-running conflict between Pakistan and India. The territory shares a border with Azad Kashmir, together with which it is referred to by the United Nations and other international organisations as “Pakistan administered Kashmir”.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-cultural-traditions-in-singapore>What are the main cultural traditions in Singapore?</h2>
<p>The main cultural traditions are Malay, Indian, Chinese, and to some extent Western (British). The different communities do not regard themselves as sharing a culture; instead, they consider themselves parts of a whole.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-do-people-in-singapore-eat>What kind of food do people in Singapore eat?</h2>
<p>Forks and spoons are used, but Chinese food is eaten with chopsticks, and Indian and Malay food may be eaten with the hand. The three main meals are breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Most meals are eaten hot. Malays do not eat pork, Indians do not eat beef, and many Buddhist Chinese are part-time vegetarians. Many people do not drink alcohol.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-satay-do-they-have-in-singapore>What kind of satay do they have in Singapore?</h2>
<p>A must try is their signature Pork Belly Satay. Its marinade is made with a variety of spices such as cumin, fennel and coriander, while its Peranakan-style peanut sauce comes with pineapple. Kwong’s Satay also supplies satay for BBQ events and parties.</p>

<h2 id=why-are-there-different-styles-of-clothes-in-different-countries>Why are there different styles of clothes in different countries?</h2>
<p>We all have our own ways of dressing, our different tastes in fashion and clothes. Every day wear, and formal cultural attire and costumes, come in different styles around the world. Going to school in Australia, Malaysia and Singapore meant I had opportunities to shop for clothes regularly in three different countries.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-traditional-dress-in-punjab>Which is the most traditional dress in Punjab?</h2>
<p>Patiala Salwar – Furled up Beauty – Traditional Dress of Punjab This baggy and pleated trouser has its roots in the city of Punjab called Patiala and was initially donned by men but later became a part of women’s attire as well. It is usually combined with a Kurti and a chunni for women with a draping pattern at the back.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-women-wear-long-sleeves-in-punjab>Why do women wear long sleeves in Punjab?</h2>
<p>It was originally a dress for the men but was also worn by women with tight-fitting pyjama. Characterised by the long sleeves and tied under the armpits, it allows freedom of movement, making it another comfortable traditional attire of Punjab.</p>
