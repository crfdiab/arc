<h2 id=why-was-the-city-of-tenochtitlan-built>Why was the city of Tenochtitlan built?</h2>
<p>Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec empire, was founded by the Aztec or Mexica people around 1325 C.E. According to legend, the Mexica founded Tenochtitlan after leaving their homeland of Aztlan at the direction of their god, Huitzilopochtli. The Aztec built their capital city, Tenochtitlan, on Lake Texcoco.</p>

<p>Mexico City<br>
Tenochtitlán, ancient capital of the Aztec empire. Located at the site of modern Mexico City, it was founded c. 1325 in the marshes of Lake Texcoco. It formed a confederacy with Texcoco and Tlacopán and was the Aztec capital by the late 15th century.</p>

<p>A model of reconstructed Tenochtitlán is featured at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. (Image credit: National Museum of Anthropology ) Tenochtitlán was an Aztec city that flourished between A.D. 1325 and 1521.</p>

<p>Because according to the Legend, the God Huitzilopochtli give precise instructions to the Mexicans about the place they should build their altepetl (city state) after they left Azlan. This instructions were: Go and find a place, there will be an Eagle above a cactus (nopal) in an island in the middle of a lake.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-templo-mayor-of-tenochtitlan-built>When was the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan built?</h2>
<p>of the Templo Mayor began with a simple structure, probably dedicated to Huitzilopochtli, built in 1325 when Tenochtitlan was founded. Subsequently the Templo Mayor grew enormously both in size and elaboration, resulting in the impressive structure seen by the Spaniards in 1519.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spanish-destroy-tenochtitlan-in-1521>How did the Spanish destroy Tenochtitlan in 1521?</h2>
<p>Built on an island on Lake Texcoco, it had a system of canals and causeways that supplied the hundreds of thousands of people who lived there. It was largely destroyed by the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés after a siege in 1521, and modern-day Mexico City now lies over much of its remains.</p>
