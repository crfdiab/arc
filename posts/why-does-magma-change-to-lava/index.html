<h2 id=why-does-magma-change-to-lava>Why does magma change to lava?</h2>
<p>All magma contains dissolved gases. As it rises to the surface, the pressure is reduced and the dissolved gases can escape. If the lava is runny (not viscous), the gases can escape easily and the lava will just run down the landscape (somewhat like syrup).</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-lava-lava>What makes lava lava?</h2>
<p>Lava is mostly made of two elements — Si (the symbol for silicon) and O (the symbol for oxygen). Together, they make a very strong bond and then get together with other elements, like Fe (iron), Mg (magnesium), K (potassium), Ca (calcium), and more. The volcano erupted it before the elements could become crystals.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-magma-or-lava-come-from>Where does magma or lava come from?</h2>
<p>Lava (which as you undoubtedly know, is partially molten rock erupted by volcanoes) typically comes from the mantle—the Earth’s middle layer, sandwiched between the crust and the core. Once it reaches the surface, lava quickly cools down and solidifies completely, creating new land.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-lava-and-magma>What is the difference between lava and magma?</h2>
<p>Both Magma and Lava refer to the molten rock which forms igneous rocks on the surface. The only difference is the molten rock on the surface of the earth is called lava, and the molten rock found below the surface of the earth is called magma. What is the origin of the words Magma and Lava?</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-magma-when-it-rises-to-the-surface>What happens to magma when it rises to the surface?</h2>
<p>Rising magma tends to remain fluid, even if it’s cooling because it continues to decompress. There is no guarantee that a magma will reach the surface, though.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-lava-and-molten-rock>What’s the difference between lava and molten rock?</h2>
<p>The only difference is the molten rock on the surface of the earth is called lava, and the molten rock found below the surface of the earth is called magma. What is the origin of the words Magma and Lava? Magma comes from Italian, which means thick, pasty substance. This is the characteristic of magma inside the earth surface.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-igneous-rocks-formed-in-a-volcano>How are igneous rocks formed in a volcano?</h2>
<p>The igneous rocks are formed when the magma comes out from the interior of the planet and forms a molten rock called lava. The volcanic eruptions originate from magma chambers. Magma contains suspended crystals and gas bubbles.</p>
