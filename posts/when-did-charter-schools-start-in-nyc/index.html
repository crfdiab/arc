<h2 id=when-did-charter-schools-start-in-nyc>When did charter schools start in NYC?</h2>
<p>1998<br>
When did this happen? Charter schools became part of NY State’s public education offerings with the passing of the NY State Charter Schools Act of 1998 . Charter schools in New York are authorized by three groups: New York City Department of Education (DOE)</p>
<h2 id=are-charter-schools-free-in-ny>Are charter schools free in NY?</h2>
<p>Charter schools are free, public schools that operate independently from traditional school districts. New York’s two charter school authorizers— the New York Board of Regents and SUNY Charter Schools Institute— manage and approve the “charters” under which these schools operate.</p>
<h2 id=are-charter-schools-better-than-public-schools-in-nyc>Are charter schools better than public schools in NYC?</h2>
<p>Looking at the data, New York City charter schools are putting up better numbers than public schools. Per NYCCharterSchools.org, charter schools in the city provided much higher proficiency numbers last year. ELA proficiency rates for students grades 3-8 were at 57.3% while math proficiency rates were at 63.87%.</p>
<h2 id=do-nyc-charter-schools-charge-tuition>Do NYC charter schools charge tuition?</h2>
<p>Do charter schools charge tuition? No. They are free public schools.</p>
<h2 id=who-funds-charter-schools-in-nyc>Who funds charter schools in NYC?</h2>
<p>school boards<br>
In New York, charter schools receive their funding from the local school boards of the districts where they reside. School boards must send a “proportional share” of their per-pupil funding to those charter schools. In the 2016-2017 school year, this amount will be equal to 100 percent of the funding formula.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-public-school-and-charter-school>What is the difference between public school and charter school?</h2>
<p>The difference between charter schools and public schools in terms of flexibility is, charter schools are run by a private board and public schools are run by the state board of education. Public schools are to follow rules governed by the school districts that establish the state law.</p>
<h2 id=when-to-apply-to-new-york-city-charter-schools>When to apply to New York City Charter Schools?</h2>
<p>Use the Common Online Charter School Application to apply to multiple NYC charter schools for the 2021-22 school year. Registration is open for the Collaborative’s annual capstone event on June 9 & 10!</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-authorizers-of-charter-schools-in-new-york>Who are the authorizers of charter schools in New York?</h2>
<p>Authorizers. A charter school may be authorized by the State University of New York (through its Charter Schools Institute), New York State’s Education Department’s Board of Regents, or the New York City Department of Education (through the Chancellor’s office and the Deputy Executive Director).</p>
<h2 id=when-do-school-holidays-start-in-new-york>When do school holidays start in New York?</h2>
<p>Please choose your school district in New York from the list below to view a calendar of your 2020-2021 school holidays. 2021-2022 calendars are being added as they become available.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-charter-schools-were-authorized-in-2020>How many charter schools were authorized in 2020?</h2>
<p>By the May 15th deadline, the Charter School Office received 7 full applications to establish new charter schools authorized by the Board of Regents. In response to the 2020 Request for Proposals issued in January, the Charter School Office received 13 “letters of intent” to apply to establish new charter schools authorized by the Board of Regents.</p>
