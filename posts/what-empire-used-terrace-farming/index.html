<h2 id=what-empire-used-terrace-farming>What empire used terrace farming?</h2>
<p>the Incas<br>
Because the Incas lived in the mountains, they had no flat land for farming. They had to build wide step-like areas called terraces for farming. Through terrace farming, the Incas were able to provide for all people in the empire.</p>
<h2 id=who-used-terrace-farming-south-america>Who used terrace farming South America?</h2>
<p>South America In the South American Andes, farmers have used terraces, known as andenes, for over a thousand years to farm potatoes, maize, and other native crops.</p>
<h2 id=what-civilizations-used-terraces>What civilizations used terraces?</h2>
<p>Terracing, which is basically grading steep land, such as hillsides, into a series of level benches,… Terrace cultivation has been practiced in China, Japan, the Philippines, and other areas of Oceania and Southeast Asia; around the Mediterranean; in parts of Africa; and in the Andes of South America for centuries.</p>
<h2 id=which-indigenous-empire-was-known-for-their-terracing-in-south-america>Which indigenous empire was known for their terracing in South America?</h2>
<p>The Incas were masters of their harsh climate, archaeologists are finding—and the ancient civilization has a lot to teach us today.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-they-use-terrace-farming-in-machu-picchu>Why did they use terrace farming in Machu Picchu?</h2>
<p>This expressed itself in the form of stone terraces to keep the important Andean soil from eroding down the mountain side. These terraces also helped to insulate the roots of plants during cold nights and hold in the moisture of the soil, keeping plants growing and producing longer in the high altitudes.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-two-empires-in-central-and-south-america>Who are the two empires in Central and South America?</h2>
<p>None had domesticated animals or the use of the wheel. In the 1500s, when Spanish conquistadors appeared, two vast empires, those of the Aztecs and the Incas, dominated Central and South America. Both possessed divine kings, both were fractured by internal dissent, and both quickly succumbed to the Spanish onslaught.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-incas-use-to-build-their-terraces>What did the Incas use to build their terraces?</h2>
<p>Terraces The Inca empire began in a mountainous region with limited access to flat land. To overcome this issue, they constructed terraces by carving out sections of the mountain into usable flat surfaces.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-location-of-the-spanish-empire>What was the location of the Spanish Empire?</h2>
<p>The Spanish Empire was composed of colonies and territories of the Spanish Monarch distributed throughout the Americas, Asia, Africa, Oceania, the Greater Antilles, South America, and some Pacific Ocean Archipelagos such as the Philippines.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-terrace-farming-take-place-in-the-world>Where does terrace farming take place in the world?</h2>
<p>Definition Of Terrace Farming. Terrace farming is a type of farming that was invented by the Inca people who lived in the South American mountains. This farming method has made cultivation of crops in hilly or mountainous regions possible. It is commonly used in Asia by rice-growing countries such as Vietnam, Philippines, and Indonesia.</p>
