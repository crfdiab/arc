<h2 id=why-do-typhoons-have-names>Why do typhoons have names?</h2>
<p>Typhoons are named after number-based conventions and a list-based convention. The latter convention is more popular in most countries, such as human names for hurricanes, while the former is popular in Japan. Both conventions, however, share the same problem of ambiguity.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-hurricanes-have-boy-and-girl-names>Why do hurricanes have boy and girl names?</h2>
<p>Storms are given short, distinctive names to avoid confusion and streamline communications. In 1953, the United States began using female names for storms and, by 1978, both male and female names were used to identify Northern Pacific storms. This was then adopted in 1979 for storms in the Atlantic basin.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-philippine-typhoons-have-two-names>Why do Philippine typhoons have two names?</h2>
<p>The Philippine Weather Bureau started naming storms within their area of responsibility in 1963, using female Filipino names ending in the former native alphabetical order. This often resulted in a Western Pacific cyclone carrying two names: an international name and a local name used within the Philippines.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-they-change-the-names-of-typhoons>Why do they change the names of typhoons?</h2>
<p>The names of storms that cause widespread damage and death are usually retired. These names are replaced with new ones. In the Pacific Ocean regions, each country contributes names for storms. Those from Hong Kong appear pretty lame, and haven’t exactly struck fear into those who hear them.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-hurricanes-and-cyclones-have-female-names>Why do hurricanes and cyclones have female names?</h2>
<p>And in 2004 a by the name of Hurricane Charley hit Central Florida along with three other two female names the last one had males name. If the storm was real bad that name will be retired. So you never a Hurricane in Atlantic with name Florence. What does Google know about me?</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-first-tropical-storm-have-a-male-name>Why did the first tropical storm have a male name?</h2>
<p>Despite the differences in opinion, the year 1978 saw introduction of male names to the list due to extreme pressure from people and groups like National Organization for Women. The first tropical Atlantic storm with a male name was Bob that struck the Gulf of Mexico in July 1979.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-hurricane-and-a-typhoon>What’s the difference between a hurricane and a typhoon?</h2>
<p>The latter convention is more popular in most countries, such as human names for hurricanes, while the former is popular in Japan. Both conventions, however, share the same problem of ambiguity. We have the following types of naming conventions of the typhoon, the hurricane, and the tropical cyclone (hereafter we call all of them as the typhoon).</p>
