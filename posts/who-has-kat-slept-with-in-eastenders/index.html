<p>EastEnders legends Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) had sex in tonight’s episode (February 15) of the BBC One soap. Yes, that actually happened.

<p>Viewers know Gray is the one who killed Kush, pushing him into the tracks in front of an oncoming tube train in a fit of jealous rage over Whitney. But after “grassing up” the Mitchells shortly before his death, it makes sense for Whitney to believe Phil and/or Ben were involved.</p>

<h2 id=did-janine-butcher-kill-michael-moon>Did Janine Butcher kill Michael Moon?</h2>
<p>He finally loosened his grip when a desperate and distraught Alice stabbed him.

Michael Moon finally lost the battle when a fatal stab ended his action packed life. Killed by: Janine Butcher.</p>
