<h2 id=who-challenged-the-puritan-leaders>Who challenged the Puritan leaders?</h2>
<p>Anne Hutchinson (née Marbury; July 1591 – August 1643) was a Puritan spiritual advisor, religious reformer, and an important participant in the Antinomian Controversy which shook the infant Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1636 to 1638….</p>

<h2 id=who-challenged-the-power-of-ministers-in-puritan-society>Who challenged the power of ministers in Puritan society?</h2>
<p>When dissenters, including Puritan minister Roger Williams and midwife Anne Hutchinson, challenged Governor Winthrop in Massachusetts Bay in the 1630s, they both were banished from the colony.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-authority-governed-the-puritans>What kind of authority governed the Puritans?</h2>
<p>Their society was a theocracy that governed every aspect of their lives. Freedom of religion and freedom of speech or of the press were as foreign to the Puritans as to the Church of England. When other colonists arrived with differing beliefs, they were driven out by the Puritans.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-in-charge-of-the-government-in-the-puritan-settlements>Who was in charge of the government in the Puritan settlements?</h2>
<p>Massachusetts Bay Colony, one of the original English settlements in present-day Massachusetts, settled in 1630 by a group of about 1,000 Puritan refugees from England under Gov. John Winthrop and Deputy Gov. Thomas Dudley.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-puritans-call-themselves-the-precisionists>Why did the Puritans call themselves the Precisionists?</h2>
<p>The name “Puritans” (they were sometimes called “precisionists”) was a term of contempt assigned to the movement by its enemies. Although the epithet first emerged in the 1560s, the movement began in the 1530s, when King Henry VIII repudiated papal authority and transformed the Church of Rome into a state Church of England.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-puritans-view-the-relationship-between-master-and-servant>How did the Puritans view the relationship between master and servant?</h2>
<p>Puritans also viewed the relationship between a master and a servant as to that of a parent and son. Some Puritans disapproved of Christmas celebrations and secular entertainment on moral grounds. Puritans formed a religious and political movement at a time when religion and the state were intertwined.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-puritans-influence-the-church-of-england>How did the Puritans influence the Church of England?</h2>
<p>Influence of the Puritans. Puritans formed a religious and political movement at a time when religion and the state were intertwined. The movement which was created on the need to get rid of Catholic-like practices in the Church of England went international through migrations of the clergies that felt oppressed by the state.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-england-during-the-puritan-movement>Who was the King of England during the Puritan movement?</h2>
<p>The Church of England. Through the reigns of the Protestant King Edward VI (1547-1553), who introduced the first vernacular prayer book, and the Catholic (1553-1558), who sent some dissenting clergymen to their deaths and others into exile, the Puritan movement–whether tolerated or suppressed–continued to grow.</p>
