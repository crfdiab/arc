<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-we-had-no-moon>What would happen if we had no moon?</h2>
<p>The moon affects the angle of the Earth’s tilt. The moon influences life as we know it on Earth. It influences our oceans, weather, and the hours in our days. Without the moon, tides would fall, nights would be darker, seasons would change, and the length of our days would alter.</p>
<h2 id=will-the-moon-crash-into-earth>Will the moon crash into Earth?</h2>
<p>The moon does not fall to Earth because it is in an orbit. One of the most difficult things to learn about physics is the concept of force. Just because there is a force on something does not mean it will be moving in the direction of the force.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-would-we-last-if-the-sun-went-out>How long would we last if the sun went out?</h2>
<p>Likewise, if the sun simply “turned off” (which is actually physically impossible), the Earth would stay warm-at least compared with the space surrounding it-for a few million years. But we surface dwellers would feel the chill much sooner than that.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-moon-rotation-take>How long does Moon rotation take?</h2>
<p>27.3 days<br>
The Moon takes about one month to orbit Earth (27.3 days to complete a revolution, but 29.5 days to change from New Moon to New Moon). As the Moon completes each 27.3-day orbit around Earth, both Earth and the Moon are moving around the Sun.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-interesting-fact-about-the-moon>What is the most interesting fact about the moon?</h2>
<p>1. The Moon is Earth’s only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-life-on-earth-if-there-is-no-moon>What happens to life on Earth if there is no moon?</h2>
<p>Without the moon helping to keep the earth on a steady tilt, scientists have even imagined that life on earth may not have evolved the way we know it. So the next time you look up at the night sky, realize that the moon is making life here on earth shine bright. What If There Were No Moon? Authorized news sources may reproduce our content.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-would-the-earth-be-without-the-moon>How big would the Earth be without the Moon?</h2>
<p>However, without the presence of the Moon, the impact rate could be much higher, making the Earth a fairly hostile place. The Moon is almost 3,500 kilometers (2,175 mi) in diameter—about 27 percent of the Earth’s diameter. Thanks to its large size, the Moon has served as a protection for Earth in times of cosmic adversity.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-earth-stable-without-the-moon>How is the Earth stable without the Moon?</h2>
<p>Click on image to enlarge. The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon also stabilised the tilt of Earth’s axis, and it is today’s constant tilt of 23.5° that gives Earth its predictable, fairly constant climate and its seasons ( figure 2 ). Without the Moon, however, the axis would have continued to wobble.</p>
<h2 id=what-if-the-moon-never-formed>What if the Moon never formed?</h2>
<p>And if the Moon had never formed, Earth would be a very, very different place. An Earth day would be only 8-10 h long, with no moon to slow it down. The faster rotation would cause winds of 160-200 km to sweep Earth’s surface.</p>
