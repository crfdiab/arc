<h2 id=what-is-the-old-name-of-beirut>What is the old name of Beirut?</h2>
<p>The city’s story began more than 5,000 years ago, although its name came later when the Canaanites dubbed it Be’erot. An outpost of the ancient Phoenician world, Beirut later became part of the Roman Empire shortly after the first century began.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-the-city-of-beirut>How old is the city of Beirut?</h2>
<p>5,000 years ago<br>
It is one of the oldest cities in the world, inhabited more than 5,000 years ago. The first historical mention of Beirut is found in the ancient Egyptian Tell el Amarna letters dating from the 15th century BC.</p>

<h2 id=how-old-is-lebanon>How old is Lebanon?</h2>
<p>With nearly 5,000 years of history, Lebanon is one of the world’s oldest countries.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-old-city-of-beirut-located>Where was the old city of Beirut located?</h2>
<p>The downtown area of central Beirut (the old city) was destroyed during the civil war, becoming a belt of squatter-occupied ruins between East and West Beirut.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-civil-war-end-in-beirut>When did the Civil War end in Beirut?</h2>
<p>When the war ended in 1990, strong divisions arose between official and popular opinion over plans for reconstructing the old city. Standing property rights, which were largely in the hands of Sunni Muslim and Christian landowners, clashed with the then de facto situation that most of the resident squatters in the area were Shiʿi Muslims.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-entry-point-into-beirut>What was the main entry point into Beirut?</h2>
<p>The government-owned Port of Beirut serves as the main maritime entry point into Lebanon and a vital piece of infrastructure for the importation of scarce goods. The Beirut Naval Base is a part of the port.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-beirut-explosion-in-2020>What was the cause of the Beirut explosion in 2020?</h2>
<p>For the 1983 explosions, see 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. On 4 August 2020, a large amount of ammonium nitrate stored at the port of the city of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, exploded, causing at least 207 deaths, 7,500 injuries, and US$ 15 billion in property damage, and leaving an estimated 300,000 people homeless.</p>
