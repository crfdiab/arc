<h2 id=how-old-was-three-rivers-stadium>How old was Three Rivers Stadium?</h2>
<p>51c. 1970<br>
Three Rivers Stadium/Age</p>
<h2 id=what-river-is-by-heinz-stadium>What river is by Heinz stadium?</h2>
<p>Ohio River<br>
Heinz Company, which purchased the naming rights in 2001. Funded in conjunction with PNC Park and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, the $281 million (equivalent to $410.7 million in 2020) stadium stands along the Ohio River, on the Northside of Pittsburgh in the North Shore neighborhood.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-3-rivers-stadium>Why is it called 3 Rivers stadium?</h2>
<p>The stadium was named in February 1969 for its location at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which forms the Ohio River. It would sometimes be called The House That Clemente Built after Pirates’ right-fielder Roberto Clemente.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-three-rivers-stadium-located-in-ohio>Where are the Three Rivers Stadium located in Ohio?</h2>
<p>TV viewers everywhere were treated to overhead views of the Stadium and the surrounding area – the Golden Triangle, the inclines of Mt. Washington, the steel mills and, of course, the three rivers, the Allegheny and Monongahela which meet to form the Ohio.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-three-rivers-stadium-built-in-pittsburgh>When was Three Rivers Stadium built in Pittsburgh?</h2>
<p>In 1958 a site in the Northside region of Pittsburgh, where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers join to form the Ohio River was chosen to build a new stadium. Originally scheduled to open in the 1960s construction was delayed multiple times due to construction and financial issues. Construction of Three Rivers Stadium began on April 25, 1968.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-best-feature-of-three-rivers-stadium>What was the best feature of Three Rivers Stadium?</h2>
<p>One of the stadium’s most luxurious features was the Allegheny Club, a restaurant that accommodated 300 people for a view of the field and 400 people in the main dining area. Statues of greats Roberto Clemente and Honus Wagner sat outside the stadium.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-three-rivers-in-pittsburgh>What are the names of the Three Rivers in Pittsburgh?</h2>
<p>In Pittsburgh, we owe the existence of our own city to its three rivers: The Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio. But what was here before the skyscrapers of glass and steel? Before the last Ice Age, the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers flowed north, emptying into Lake Erie.</p>
