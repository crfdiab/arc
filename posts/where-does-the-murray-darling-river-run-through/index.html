<h2 id=where-does-the-murray-darling-river-run-through>Where does the Murray Darling river run through?</h2>
<p>The Murray–Darling Basin is in the south east of Australia and covers 14% of Australia’s land area. As the map below shows, it covers large areas of New South Wales and Victoria, all of the Australian Capital Territory, and some of Queensland and South Australia.</p>
<h2 id=what-towns-does-the-darling-river-go-through>What towns does the Darling River go through?</h2>
<p>Major settlements along the river include Brewarrina, Bourke, Louth, Tilpa, Wilcannia, Menindee, Pooncarie and Wentworth.</p>
<h2 id=what-states-does-the-murray-darling-basin-run-through>What states does the Murray Darling Basin run through?</h2>
<p>It flows into the Murray at the border of New South Wales and Victoria, and the Murray eventually reaches the sea just to the south-east of Adelaide. The Basin includes most of New South Wales, some of southern Queensland, the east of South Australia, northern Victoria and all of the Australian Capital Territory.</p>

<p>Severn<br>
The main source of the Darling is usually considered to be the Severn, which becomes successively the Dumaresq, Macintyre, Barwon, and, finally, the Darling. Discharge of the lower tributaries (Culgoa, Warrego, Paroo, Gwydir, Namoi, Macquarie, and Bogan) of the main stream fluctuates as a result of droughts and floods.</p>

<p>The Darling River Run joins the Murray River at Wentworth. Experience the Discover Murray River Trail and enjoy a combined great outback river’s experience!</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-darling-river-run-start-and-end>Where does the Darling River run start and end?</h2>
<p>The Darling River Run is an Australian driving adventure from Walgett (or Lightning Ridge) in Outback New South Wales, along the Darling River with the river’s confluence with the Murray River at Wentworth on the NSW/Vic border covering 750 km of outback experiences. What is the Darling River?</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-people-that-live-in-the-murray-darling-basin>Who are the people that live in the Murray Darling basin?</h2>
<p>The Murray-Darling Basin drainage system has remained in virtually the same place for millions of years. From millennia Aboriginal people have relied on the river’s abundance. The many various groups included Ingalta, Moorundie, Goodwarra, Parrian-kaperre, Tongwillum, and Yoorlooarra.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fish-are-in-the-murray-darling-river>What kind of fish are in the Murray Darling River?</h2>
<p>Also plentiful are fish such as the Murray Cod, Bream, Perch, and Redfin. The plant found most often along the river is the willow, which protects the banks of the river from erosion but also tends to spread out in the soil and take over the surrounding area, choking the growth of other plants.</p>
