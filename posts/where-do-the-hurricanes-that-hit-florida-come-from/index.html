<h2 id=where-do-the-hurricanes-that-hit-florida-come-from>Where do the hurricanes that hit Florida come from?</h2>
<p>The Most Hurricane-Prone Areas in Florida That’s partly due to the Gulf of Mexico, which is known for its warm shallow waters, and partly due to its location in the U.S.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-hurricanes-hit-florida>Why do hurricanes hit Florida?</h2>
<p>Ocean waters are not a uniform temperature from the surface to the ocean floor, and the world’s currents are not simple circles going round and round, but from a simplistic standpoint the surface water off the U.S. East Coast is a lot warmer than the West Coast, which is the primary reasons hurricanes hit Florida and …</p>
<h2 id=why-do-hurricanes-form-where-they-do>Why do hurricanes form where they do?</h2>
<p>A: Hurricanes form near places like Florida because hurricanes need some critical components to develop. They need a lot of water, and they also form near the tropics because they need a lot of sunlight. The sun heats the water, and that water starts evaporating and cools into clouds.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-tropical-storm-turn-into-a-hurricane>What makes a tropical storm turn into a hurricane?</h2>
<p>That provides two of the three ingredients required for tropical storms to turn into full-blown hurricanes: moist air; Earth’s rotation; and warm ocean temperatures. When the swirling winds reach speeds of 74 mph (119 km/h), the storm is classified as a Category 1 hurricane.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hurricanes-have-hit-the-state-of-florida>How many hurricanes have hit the state of Florida?</h2>
<p>More storms hit Florida than any other U.S. state, and since 1851 only eighteen hurricane seasons passed without a known storm impacting the state. Collectively, cyclones that hit the region have resulted in over 10,000 deaths, most of which occurring prior to the start of Hurricane Hunters flights in 1943.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-hurricanes-start-to-form-in-the-atlantic>When do hurricanes start to form in the Atlantic?</h2>
<p>In the movie you can see the storm starting to form in the Atlantic on August 24 and becoming more and more organized as it moves over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Click to view movie.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-hurricane-season-start-and-end-in-florida>When does hurricane season start and end in Florida?</h2>
<p>The threat of hurricanes is very real for Florida during the six-month long Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 until November 30. The peak of hurricane season occurs between mid-August and late October, when the waters in the equatorial Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico have warmed enough to help support the development of tropical waves.</p>
