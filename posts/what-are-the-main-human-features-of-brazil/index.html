<p>What Are the Physical Features of Brazil? Brazil’s physical features are characterized by its highlands, plateaus and river basins. The region is not mountainous, but it is very diverse and typically has a humid tropical or subtropical climate.</p>

<p>Not only does the archipelego form one of the Brazil’s most striking natural wonders, the wildlife is also a sight to behold. The island is home to one of the biggest sea-bird breeding colonies in the Southern Atlantic, and you can also find manta rays, moray eels, sea turtles and dolphins gliding in its waters.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-most-of-the-water-in-brazil-come-from>Where does most of the water in Brazil come from?</h2>
<p>From the Amazon basin in the north and west to the Brazilian Highlands in the southeast, Brazil’s topography is quite diverse. The Amazon River system carries more water to the ocean than any other river system in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-economy-does-brazil-have-in-the-world>What kind of economy does Brazil have in the world?</h2>
<p>While only about 5% of the land is cultivated, Brazil leads the world in coffee production (about a third of the global total). Brazil also produces a quarter of the world’s citrus, has more than one-tenth of the cattle supply, and produces one-fifth of the iron ore.</p>
