<h2 id=why-is-dr-joseph-lister-remembered>Why is Dr Joseph Lister remembered?</h2>
<p>Joseph Lister, Baron Lister of Lyme Regis OM, PC, PRS, FRCSE, FFPS (5 April 1827 – 10 February 1912), was a British surgeon, experimental pathologist and a pioneer of antiseptic surgery. Lister successfully introduced carbolic acid (now known as phenol) to sterilise surgical instruments and to clean wounds.</p>

<p>[Joseph Lister, the “father” of antiseptic surgery]</p>
<h2 id=what-is-joseph-lister-famous-for>What is Joseph Lister famous for?</h2>
<p>Joseph Lister, in full Joseph Lister, Baron Lister of Lyme Regis, also called (1883–97) Sir Joseph Lister, Baronet, (born April 5, 1827, Upton, Essex, England—died February 10, 1912, Walmer, Kent), British surgeon and medical scientist who was the founder of antiseptic medicine and a pioneer in preventive medicine.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-joseph-lister-discover-and-develop>What did Joseph Lister discover and develop?</h2>
<p>Joseph Lister found a way to prevent infection in wounds during and after surgery. He was the first to apply the science of Germ Theory to surgery. Lister’s Antisepsis System is the basis of modern infection control. His principles made surgery safe and continue to save countless lives.</p>

<p>Acknowledged as the “Father of Antiseptic Surgery”, Joseph Lister’s contributions paved the way to safer medical procedures. His introduction of the antiseptic process dramatically decreased deaths from childbirth and surgery and changed the way the medical industry looked at sanitation and proper hygiene.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-joseph-lister-when-he-died>How old was Joseph Lister when he died?</h2>
<p>84 years (1827–1912)<br>
Joseph Lister/Age at death<br>
In 1883, Queen Victoria elevated him to the peerage and in 1897 he was given the title Lord Lister of Lyme Regis [3]. In 1902, he was awarded the Order of Merit, and made a Privy Councillor. He died at his country home in Walmer, Kent in February 1912 at the age of 84.</p>
<h2 id=who-invented-sterilization>Who invented sterilization?</h2>
<p>The world-wide first steam sterilizer for surgical laundry was designed and produced by Mathias Lautenschläger in 1887 – a milestone in hospital hygiene. One year later, in 1888, Mathias Lautenschläger founded F.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-antiseptic>What was the first antiseptic?</h2>
<p>This began to change in 1867, when Joseph Lister discovered that carbolic spray was very effective in stopping wounds from getting gangrene. He developed antiseptic surgery by spraying medical instruments, catgut and bandages with a 1-in-20 solution of carbolic acid.</p>

<h2 id=is-joseph-lister-related-to-anne-lister>Is Joseph Lister related to Anne Lister?</h2>
<p>Anne Lister, born into the scientifically-minded family that produced Joseph Lister and eventually lent its name to Listerine mouthwash, was also one of the great English diarists.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-surgery-become-sterile>When did surgery become sterile?</h2>
<p>The history of sterilization was not linked from the first with surgery. Surgery came first, fully 600 years before the principles of asepsis and anesthesia were even introduced in the middle of the 1800s. Also in the 1800s, the beginnings of thermal sterilization were being developed in the food industry.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-sterilize-surgical-instruments>Why do we sterilize surgical instruments?</h2>
<p>Sterilization Procedures Surgical instruments and other material or equipment that will contact the surgical site must be sterile prior to use. The process of sterilization kills all forms of life, including bacterial spores and viruses.</p>
