<h2 id=who-came-first-mayans-or-olmecs>Who came first Mayans or Olmecs?</h2>
<p>In short, the Maya came first, and settled in modern-day Mexico. Next came the Olmecs, who also settled Mexico. They didn’t build any major cities, but they were widespread and prosperous. They were followed by the Inca in modern-day Peru, and finally the Aztecs, also in modern-day Mexico.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-first-civilization-in-central-america>What was the first civilization in Central America?</h2>
