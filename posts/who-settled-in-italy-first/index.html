<h2 id=who-settled-in-italy-first>Who settled in Italy first?</h2>
<p>During the early formation of Rome, Italy was settled by many different peoples. These included the Latin peoples (the first to settle Rome), the Greeks (who settled along the coast of Italy), the Sabines, and the Etruscans. The Etruscans were a powerful people who lived nearby Rome.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-etruscans-settle-in-italy>Where did the Etruscans settle in Italy?</h2>
<p>The Etruscans occupied the region to the north of Rome, between the Arno and Tiber Rivers to the west of the Apennine Mountains. The Romans were first a subject people of the Etruscans and later their conquerors.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-ancient-people-of-italy-start>When did the ancient people of Italy start?</h2>
<p>In regard to the specific names of particular ancient Italian tribes and peoples, the time-window in which historians know the historical ascribed names of ancient Italian peoples mostly falls into the range of about 750 BC (at the legendary foundation of Rome) to about 200 BC (in the middle Roman Republic), the time range in which most of the …</p>

<h2 id=when-did-the-etruscans-move-to-northern-italy>When did the Etruscans move to northern Italy?</h2>
<p>The Etruscans, having reached a peak of power in around 500 BCE, were pushed out of the Po valley, in northern Italy, by Celtic tribes coming in from Gaul. There they settled, and their raiding parties penetrated deep into the peninsula, sacking Rome in around 390 BCE.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-state-of-italy-in-500-bce>What was the state of Italy in 500 BCE?</h2>
<p>By 500 BCE, other Italian peoples are living in city-states, and that distinctively Greek political form, the republic, is taking root in the peninsula. In central Italy, the small city of Rome is even now winning its independence from Etruscan domination and becoming one of these new-fangled city-republics.</p>
