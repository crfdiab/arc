<h2 id=does-mexico-have-shanty-towns>Does Mexico have shanty towns?</h2>
<p>Approximately eight million people around the world live in slums, and in Mexico, most of those people are concentrated on the outskirts of the Mexican capital. Many rural residents travel to Mexico City in search of a better life only to wind up in shanty towns bordering the capital.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-slums-in-mexico-called>What are slums in Mexico called?</h2>
<p>About 10 per cent of all housing in Mexico City is in vecindades. Ciudades perdidas: this is a broad concept referring to small-scale pockets of shanty housing on vacant land or undesirable urban locations. These are no longer quantitatively important as a form of slum.</p>
<h2 id=does-mexico-city-have-any-slums>Does Mexico City have any slums?</h2>
<p>Tlalzipatli is one Mexico City’s estimated 835 slums; the national government estimates that there are 300 in the delegación of Xochimilco alone (though activists suggest the true number is closer to 500).</p>

<h2 id=why-do-people-go-to-mexico-to-live-in-shanty-towns>Why do people go to Mexico to live in shanty towns?</h2>
<p>Many rural residents travel to Mexico City in search of a better life only to wind up in shanty towns bordering the capital. However, many residents still believe that they and their families stand a better chance at finding a more dignified lifestyle in Mexico City than elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-shanty-towns-located-in-the-world>Where are shanty towns located in the world?</h2>
<p>Shanty towns are mostly found in developing nations, but also in some parts of developed nations. Such settlements are usually found on the periphery of cities, in public parks, or near railroad tracks, rivers, lagoons or city trash dump sites.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-people-live-in-mexico-city-slums>Where do people live in Mexico City slums?</h2>
<p>However, unlike in most areas, some of Mexico City’s slum dwellers also live in vecindades, former mansions abandoned by wealthy families that have been converted into low-income rental apartments. About 10 percent of all the residents of the Mexican capital live in these buildings.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-shanty-towns-in-portugal-located>Where are the shanty towns in Portugal located?</h2>
<p>In Portugal, shanty towns known as “barracas” or “bairros de lata” are made up of immigrants from former Portuguese African colonies and Roma from Eastern Europe. Most of them are located in Lisbon metropolitan area. In the United States, some cities such as Newark and Oakland have witnessed the creation of tent cities.</p>
