<h2 id=when-a-river-is-carrying-small-particles-of-clay-and-silt>When a river is carrying small particles of clay and silt?</h2>
<p>Rocks as small as tiny clay particles and larger that are moved by the water are called sediment. Fast-moving water can pick up, suspend, and move larger particles more easily than slow-moving waters.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-the-deposition-of-silt-and-clay>What do you call the deposition of silt and clay?</h2>
<p>Alluvial deposit, Material deposited by rivers. It consists of silt, sand, clay, and gravel, as well as much organic matter.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-rivers-silt-up>Why do rivers silt up?</h2>
<p>When a river “bursts its banks” after heavy rain, flood water spreads out across the floodplain and, because this water hardly moves, finer silt and clay are deposited – often making good farmland! When a river reaches a lake or the sea, it quickly deposits much of its sediment.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-rocks-carried-by-a-river-are-called>When do rocks carried by a river are called?</h2>
<p>When rocks that are carried by the river scrape away the bed and banks it is called: Which process involves small pebbles and stones being bounced along the river bed? Which process involves large boulders and rocks being rolled along the river bed?</p>
<h2 id=which-is-part-of-a-river-is-deposited-by-running-water>Which is part of a river is deposited by running water?</h2>
<p>Alluvial means deposited by running water. Banks are the sides of a river or stream between which the water normally flows. The bed (also called the river bed) is the bottom of the river (or other body of water). Beackish water is water that is saltier than river water but less salty than sea water.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-particles-can-be-transported-in-a-river>What kind of particles can be transported in a river?</h2>
<p>When energy levels are very high, large rocks and boulders can be transported. Energy levels are usually higher near a river’s source, when its course is steep and its valley narrow. Energy levels rise even higher in times of flood. When energy levels are low, only small particles can be transported (if any).</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-correct-glossary-of-river-terms>Which is the correct glossary of River terms?</h2>
<p>Glossary of River Terms. Alluvial means deposited by running water. Banks are the sides of a river or stream between which the water normally flows. The bed (also called the river bed) is the bottom of the river (or other body of water).</p>
