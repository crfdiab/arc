<h2 id=what-charge-is-the-south-pole-of-a-magnet>What charge is the South Pole of a magnet?</h2>
<p>A magnet has a North and a South Pole. A magnetic field flows from the North to the South Pole in the same way that electric fields flow from positive to negative charges. However, once cannot isolate magnetic poles as one can isolate electric charges.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-south-side-of-a-magnet-negative>Is the south side of a magnet negative?</h2>
<p>Magnets have their own poles that point toward the Earth‚Äôs poles. The end of the magnet pointing north is the negative side of the magnet. The end of the magnet pointing south is the positive side of the magnet.</p>
<h2 id=do-magnetic-poles-have-charges>Do magnetic poles have charges?</h2>
<p>Magnetic fields are associated with two magnetic poles, north and south, although they are also produced by charges (but moving charges). Like poles repel; unlike poles attract. Electric field points in the direction of the force experienced by a positive charge.</p>
<h2 id=are-magnets-positively-or-negatively-charged>Are magnets positively or negatively charged?</h2>
<p>All magnets have two poles ‚Äì positive and negative. In order to make a negative charge magnet, you will have to make a simple magnet. A simple magnet is created by running an electrical current through a metallic object.</p>
<h2 id=is-north-pole-negative-or-positive>Is North Pole negative or positive?</h2>
<p>On Earth, the north (positive) pole of the Earth‚Äôs magnet is in fact at its South geographic pole. A compass needle sure enough indicates North, but if you put a compass needle near a bar magnet, it points AWAY from the north (positive) pole of the bar magnet.</p>
<h2 id=do-negative-and-negative-magnets-attract>Do negative and negative magnets attract?</h2>
<p>Electric charges and magnetism similar Just as the positive (+) and negative (‚àí) electrical charges attract each other, the N and S poles of a magnet attract each other. In electricity like charges repel, and in magnetism like poles repel.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-negative-magnetic-field>Is there a negative magnetic field?</h2>
<p>With magnetism, there are north and south poles. Similar to charges, like magnetic poles repel each other, while unlike poles attract. An important difference between electricity and magnetism is that in electricity it is possible to have individual positive and negative charges.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-south-pole-of-a-magnet-positive-or-negative>Is the South Pole of a magnet positive or negative?</h2>
<p>Assigning negative or positive signs is just for the ease of recognition of polarization. Neither south pole nor the north pole are negative. To understand it let us consider an image. Here in the solenoid current is entering from the right end wire.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-north-pole-positive-or-negative-charged>Is the North Pole positive or negative charged?</h2>
<p>For the Earth the north pole has a negative polarity and the south pole a positive polarity. The Sun has this also, but with the Sun there is a magnetic reverse every 11 years in the solar maximum where the north and south poles get the opposite polarity. This will normally be in the next coming months or so. It‚Äôs all about magnetism üòâ</p>
<h2 id=are-there-positive-and-negative-charges-in-magnetic-fields>Are there positive and negative charges in magnetic fields?</h2>
<p>Positive and negative Unlike electricity, magnetic fields do not have charge. Therefore, the terms positive and negative do not carry the same meaning for magnetic fields as they do for electrical fields. Gauss‚Äôs law for magnetism states that there are no ‚Äúmagnetic charges‚Äù comparable to electric charges.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-magnets-attracted-to-the-north-pole>How are magnets attracted to the North Pole?</h2>
<p>Your magnet‚Äôs north pole is attracted to the Earth‚Äôs north pole. Technically, the Earth is labeled backwards ‚Äî the magnetic pole near the geographic north pole is actually like the magnetic south pole of a magnet. If you hang a small stack of magnets on a long thread, the magnets will freely rotate.</p>
