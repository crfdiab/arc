<h2 id=how-did-malthusian-thinking-make-the-irish-potato-famine-worse>How did Malthusian thinking make the Irish Potato Famine worse?</h2>
<p>“According to Malthusian doctrine, any increase in the Irish population would be due to their carnal and vicious nature. Such laws resulted in food being exported from Ireland to England while Irish peasants were literally starving to death.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-irish-potato-famine-impact-the-world>How did the Irish Potato Famine impact the world?</h2>
<p>Its immediate impact was devastating. It was the last incidence of mass hunger in the western world. It is estimated that the Famine caused about 1 million deaths between 1845 and 1851 either from starvation or hunger-related disease. A further 1 million Irish people emigrated.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-ireland-like-during-the-potato-famine>What was Ireland like during the potato Famine?</h2>
<p>With many tenant farmers unable to produce sufficient food for their own consumption, and the costs of other supplies rising, thousands died from starvation, and hundreds of thousands more from disease caused by malnutrition.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-two-effects-of-the-irish-potato-famine-on-ireland>What were two effects of the Irish Potato Famine on Ireland?</h2>
<p>What were the effects of the Great Famine? As a direct consequence of the famine, Ireland’s population fell from almost 8.4 million in 1844 to 6.6 million by 1851. About 1 million people died and perhaps 2 million more eventually emigrated from the country. Many who survived suffered from malnutrition.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-monoculture-contribute-to-the-irish-potato-famine>How did monoculture contribute to the Irish Potato Famine?</h2>
<p>Monoculture and the Irish Potato Famine: cases of missing genetic variation Lack of genetic variation in Irish potatoes contributed to the severity of the Irish potato famine, which devastated Ireland’s population and economy. Today, evolutionary theory tells us that relying on crops with low genetic variation can lead to disaster.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-potato-the-only-viable-business-for-the-irish>Why was the potato the only viable business for the Irish?</h2>
<p>In this regard, potato crop was the only viable business for Irish people because they had no access to large tracts of land. Ross also notes that most of the land used by Irish people for farming was owned and poorly managed by British landlords (9). Furthermore, the Irish population had substantially increased prior to the famine.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-ireland-export-food-during-the-great-famine>Why did Ireland export food during the Great Famine?</h2>
<p>Records show that Irish lands exported food even during the worst years of the Famine. When Ireland had experienced a famine in 1782–83, ports were closed to keep Irish-grown food in Ireland to feed the Irish.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-irish-plant-lumper-potatoes-in-the-1800s>Why did the Irish plant lumper potatoes in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>Heeding the warnings of scientists and history may help us prevent wide-scale crop devastation due to changing environmental conditions. In the 1800s, the Irish solved their problem of feeding a growing population by planting potatoes. Specifically, they planted the “lumper” potato variety.</p>
