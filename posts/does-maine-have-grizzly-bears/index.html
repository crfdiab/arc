<h2 id=does-maine-have-grizzly-bears>Does Maine have grizzly bears?</h2>
<p>Grizzlies don’t live in Maine, though, so its identification was simple. “It’s a brown phase that we rarely see on the East Coast. Occasionally we see it in Maine. I would call it ‘chocolate’ color phase,” said Cross, who said he thought just 1 in 5,000 Maine bears would have similar coloration.</p>
<h2 id=do-hedgehogs-live-in-maine>Do hedgehogs live in Maine?</h2>
<p>AUGUSTA, Maine (NEWS CENTER) — You can now legally have a hedgehog in the state of Maine without any special licenses or permits. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife have added hedgehogs to the unrestricted animal list.</p>
<h2 id=are-wolverines-in-maine>Are Wolverines in Maine?</h2>
<p>Its range once included Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North and South Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.</p>
<h2 id=what-big-animals-live-in-maine>What big animals live in Maine?</h2>
<p>Maine is well known for its wildlife. Our state has one of the biggest moose and black bear populations in the “Lower 48”. Bear and moose, along with white-tailed deer are arguably the most sought after mammals for viewing and hunting. However, smaller mammals such as beaver are also very popular with tourists.</p>
<h2 id=does-maine-have-poisonous-snakes>Does Maine have poisonous snakes?</h2>
<p>Not all snakes have fangs; only the poisonous ones do (and no poisonous snakes live in Maine!).</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-rattlesnakes-in-maine>Are there any rattlesnakes in Maine?</h2>
<p>In New England, timber rattlesnakes are listed as extirpated in Maine and Rhode Island, and endangered in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire. In New Hampshire, the timber rattlesnake is likely the most endangered of any wildlife species, as there is only one known extant population.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-animals-that-live-in-maine>Are there any animals that live in Maine?</h2>
<p>While Maine has an abundance of wildlife, several species of mammals have either gone extinct or have been extirpated from the state. These include the sea mink, caribou, eastern cougar, and wolf.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-bears-in-the-state-of-maine>Are there any Bears in the state of Maine?</h2>
<p>Seems like the bears here are pretty chill; not surprising, since there’s plenty for them to eat, and endless forest to roam. Another reason for our stellar safety record could be that Maine only has black bears- the smallest (between 200-600 lbs, which is small for a bear), most docile of all the bears.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-most-mammals-found-in-new-england>Where are most mammals found in New England?</h2>
<p>Most mammals in this region exhibit specializations for dealing with the sometimes harsh winter conditions. A comprehensive listing of all species found in the region follows. Distribution: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.</p>
