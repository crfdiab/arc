<h2 id=what-lives-in-the-california-desert>What lives in the California desert?</h2>
<p>Common animals of the California deserts include the desert bighorn sheep, desert kit fox, coyote, spotted skunk, spotted bat, black-tailed jackrabbit, ground squirrels, kangaroo rat, white-footed mouse, and desert tortoise.</p>
<h2 id=what-living-things-live-in-the-desert>What living things live in the desert?</h2>
<p>Most of the animals who live in the desert are insects, scorpions, reptiles and spiders. Most of the mammals who live in the desert are very small, but large mamals like camels, gazelles and donkeys have adapted to deal with the very dry conditions and can survive for long periods of time without water.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-animals-live-in-the-desert>Where do animals live in the desert?</h2>
<p>Animals survive in deserts by living underground or resting in burrows during the heat of the day. Some creatures get the moisture they need from their food, so they don’t need to drink much water, if any. Others live along the edges of deserts, where there are more plants and shelter.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-living-things-in-a-desert>What are two living things in a desert?</h2>
<p>Foxes, spiders, antelopes, elephants and lions are common desert species. Now for the cool animals; the Addax antelope found in the Sahara Desert is one of the most beautiful antelopes in the world.</p>
<h2 id=is-joshua-tree-safe-to-live>Is Joshua Tree safe to live?</h2>
<p>Joshua Tree is in the 19th percentile for safety, meaning 81% of cities are safer and 19% of cities are more dangerous. The rate of crime in Joshua Tree is 45.84 per 1,000 residents during a standard year. People who live in Joshua Tree generally consider the central part of the city to be the safest.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-healthy-to-live-in-the-desert>Is it healthy to live in the desert?</h2>
<p>All thanks to vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin found in natural sunlight, those gorgeous desert days can offer health advantages like the following: A stronger immune system. One reason more people get sick during the winter months could be a lack of the vitamin D found in sunlight.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-life-in-a-desert>What is life in a desert?</h2>
<p>A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-sun-a-living-thing>Is the sun a living thing?</h2>
<p>For young students things are ‘living’ if they move or grow; for example, the sun, wind, clouds and lightning are considered living because they change and move. Others think plants and certain animals are non-living.</p>
<h2 id=is-joshua-tree-dangerous-at-night>Is Joshua Tree dangerous at night?</h2>
<p>Yes, Joshua Tree and Joshua Tree National Park are safe at night. The roads are marked, and the park is patrolled. Of course, in order to ensure that your desert experience is completely free from safety concerns or emergencies, it’s important to practice caution and understand the space around you.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-such-a-thing-as-a-desert>Is there such a thing as a desert?</h2>
<p>Yes. A desert is defined as an area receiving less than 10″ of rain a year. In the map below those are the red and orange areas. The big horizontal line across the state is the traditional border between Northern and Southern California Counties.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-really-a-desert-in-southern-california>Is there really a desert in Southern California?</h2>
<p>The majority of southern California is actually a desert. Many of those who travel to California vacation along the coast so they can lounge by the beach and enjoy the pristine ocean views. While California beach cities are rightfully popular, there is much more to do and see. The California desert has numerous nature spots to check out.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-slab-city-in-the-california-desert>Where is Slab City in the California desert?</h2>
<p>It’s a hot and dusty summer night in the desert of California. We are in Slab City. Today I want to take you with us on our one night adventure in this weird and magical place.* Ever since I saw the movie Into the Wild, I was fascinated by Slab City.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-mojave-desert-located-in-california>Where is the Mojave Desert located in California?</h2>
<p>The Mojave Desert is the high desert and is located in eastern side of Southern California into the southern tip of Nevada and a bit of western Arizona. Then the furthest south is the low desert, the Sonoran Desert which runs from the southeastern tip of California, the southwest corner of Arizona, and south into Mexico.</p>
