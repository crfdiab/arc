<h2 id=did-ford-have-an-inauguration>Did Ford have an inauguration?</h2>
<p>East Room, White House, Washington, D.C. The inauguration of Gerald Ford as the 38th president of the United States was held on Friday, August 9, 1974, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., after Richard Nixon, the 37th President, resigned due to the Watergate scandal.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-jfk-inaugural-address>What is the purpose of JFK inaugural address?</h2>
<p>Assuming office in the midst of the Cold War, JFK understood that his inaugural address would have to instill confidence at home and respect abroad. He believed that democracy thrives only when citizens contribute their talents to the common good, and that it is up to leaders to inspire citizens to acts of sacrifice.</p>
<h2 id=who-gave-the-longest-inauguration-day-speech>Who gave the longest inauguration day speech?</h2>
<p>Harrison delivered the longest inaugural address to date, running 8,445 words. He wrote the entire speech himself, though it was edited by soon-to-be Secretary of State, Daniel Webster.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-give-an-inaugural-address>Do you have to give an inaugural address?</h2>
<p>When we consider the history of what most presidents have said when inaugurated, it is worth remembering this is an invented tradition; there is no Constitutional requirement for a new president to give an inaugural address. The actual requirement is only for the new president to be sworn in and take an oath per Article II, Section 1.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-inaugurations-have-there-been-in-the-united-states>How many inaugurations have there been in the United States?</h2>
<p>Since 1789 there have been 58 inaugural ceremonies to mark the commencement of a new four-year term of a president of the United States, and an additional nine marking the start of a partial presidential term following the intra-term death or resignation of an incumbent president.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-three-presidents-who-refused-to-go-to-the-inauguration>Who are the three presidents who refused to go to the inauguration?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, the president-elect arrives at the White House and proceeds to the inaugural grounds at the United States Capitol with the incumbent president. Only three incumbent presidents have refused to accompany the president-elect: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Johnson.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-longest-inaugural-address-ever-given>What was the longest inaugural address ever given?</h2>
<p>While many of the early Presidents read their addresses before taking the oath, current custom dictates that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court administer the oath first, followed by the President’s speech. William Henry Harrison delivered the longest Inaugural address, at 8,445 words, on March 4, 1841—a bitterly cold, wet day.</p>
