<h2 id=what-are-the-restrictions-to-become-president>What are the restrictions to become President?</h2>
<p>According to Article II of the U.S. Constitution, the president must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a resident of the United States for 14 years.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-constitutional-requirements-to-run-for-president>What are the 3 constitutional requirements to run for President?</h2>
<p>A Presidential candidate must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A natural born citizen (U.S. citizen from birth)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 35 years old and.</p>
</li>

<h2 id=a-us-resident-permanently-lives-in-the-us-for-at-least-14-years-can-you-run-for-president-with-criminal-record>A U.S. resident (permanently lives in the U.S.) for at least 14 years. Can you run for President with criminal record?</h2>
<p>be at least 40 years old when declaring candidacy; not have been convicted of crimes against humanity, a criminal act or deprived of civil rights by court; not have previously served more than two terms as president.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-citizen-of-the-united-states-run-for-president>Can a citizen of the United States run for President?</h2>
<p>Any eligible citizen can run for the office, though winning the position requires a lot of time, money, and dedication. You must also have lived 14 years in America to run for President.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-former-candidate-for-president-run-for-president-again>Can a former candidate for president run for president again?</h2>
<p>Yes, not only can a former candidate run for president again, but it is very common. Ronald Reagan lost the nomination in 1976 and became president in 1980, and Richard Nixon lost the general election in 1960 and became president in 1968.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-eligible-for-the-office-of-president-of-the-united-states>Who is eligible for the Office of President of the United States?</h2>
<p>No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-convicted-felon-run-for-president-in-the-united-states>Can a convicted felon run for president in the United States?</h2>
<p>Being convicted of a felony in the US does not bar one from holding an office. Someone convicted of multiple felonies whether he served his sentences or not is eligible to run for office, be elected, and serve his term. He can even serve from prison. We have had two convicts running for president from prison.</p>
