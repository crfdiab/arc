<p>The Dust Bowl exodus was the largest migration in American history. By 1940, 2.5 million people had moved out of the Plains states; of those, 200,000 moved to California.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-dust-bowl-affect-people-in-oklahoma>How did the Dust Bowl affect people in Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>Roughly 2.5 million people left the Dust Bowl states—Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma—during the 1930s. It was one of the largest migrations in American history. Oklahoma alone lost 440,000 people to migration. Many of them, poverty-stricken, traveled west looking for work.</p>

<p>7,000 people<br>
In the Dust Bowl, about 7,000 people, men, women and especially small children lost their lives to “dust pneumonia.” At least 250,000 people fled the Plains.</p>

<p>Agricultural conditions grew only bleaker through the 1930s. During the Dust Bowl the drought in the Oklahoma Panhandle and northwest section of Oklahoma reached its peak at mid-decade. Blowing dust turned day into night throughout the state. Rural population declined, and urban population grew as some farm families moved to town in search of work.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-the-great-depression-affect-people-in-oklahoma>How did the Great Depression affect people in Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>The Great Depression, combined with the Dust Bowl, destroyed many farms and left hundreds of thousands of Oklahomans unemployed. Droughts and high winds were treacherous at times, and due to the conditions in Oklahoma, more than 15% of Oklahomans moved to California. Some of the hardest hit areas were in rural Oklahoma.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-soil-was-removed-in-the-dust-bowl>How much soil was removed in the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>It was estimated that 300 million tons of soil were removed from the region in May 1934 and spread over large portions of the eastern United States. By 1935 an additional 850 million tons of topsoil was blowing in 101 counties of various states.</p>
