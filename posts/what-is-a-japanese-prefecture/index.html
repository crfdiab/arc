<h2 id=what-is-a-japanese-prefecture>What is a Japanese prefecture?</h2>
<p>They include 43 prefectures proper (県, ken) two urban prefectures (府, fu: Osaka and Kyoto), one “circuit” or “territory” (道, dō: Hokkaido) and one metropolis (都, to: Tokyo)….Prefectures of Japan.</p>
<table><tr><th>Prefecture 都道府県 Todōfuken</th></tr><tr><td>Category</td><td>First level administrative division of a unitary state</td></tr><tr><td>Location</td><td>Japan</td></tr><tr><td>Number</td><td>47 Prefectures</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=is-a-japanese-prefecture-the-same-as-a-state>Is a Japanese prefecture the same as a state?</h2>
<p>Yes, Japan is a prefecture like a US state, and it is divided into 23 wards. Some remote islands and cities like Musashino City, Fuchu City and Mitaka City are the part of this Tokyo prefecture. Japan has 47 prefectures instead of states or provinces and Tokyo is considered one of them.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-japanese-district>What is a Japanese district?</h2>
<p>In Japan, a district (郡, gun) is composed of one or more rural municipalities (towns or villages) within a prefecture. Districts have no governing function, and are only used for geographic or statistical purposes such as mailing addresses. Cities are not part of districts.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-prefecture-and-a-city>What is the difference between a prefecture and a city?</h2>
<p>A prefecture is bigger than a city. In Japan there are 47 prefectures.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-japan-use-prefectures>Why does Japan use prefectures?</h2>
<p>Japan’s prefectures were created in the early Meiji Period to replace the old feudal domains (han), which had been ruled by feudal lords known as daimyo. Often the previous castle town of the old han became the new capital of the prefecture. See a numbered map of all 47 prefectures in Japan.</p>

<p>What is another word for prefecture?</p>

<h2 id=which-is-the-smallest-state-in-japan>Which is the smallest state in Japan?</h2>
<p>Kagawa<br>
Kagawa is currently the smallest prefecture, by area, in Japan. Kagawa is a relatively narrow prefecture located between the mountains of Shikoku and the sea.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-prefectures-and-districts-are-there-in-japan>How many prefectures and districts are there in Japan?</h2>
<p>The prefectures of Japan and all Japanese cities exceeding 150,000 inhabitants. The population of the prefectures, districts and cities of Japan. COVID-19 cases by Japanese prefectures.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-japan-use-the-word--prefecture->Why does Japan use the word ” prefecture “?</h2>
<p>Anyhoo, I get this question a lot from friends: why does Japan use the word “prefecture?” Why does Japan have Prefectures? Well, Japan doesn’t use the word “prefecture” in Japanese. Rather, they have a set of four words used to describe these administrative districts that lie just below the level of nationhood.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-tokyo-and-other-prefectures>What’s the difference between Tokyo and other prefectures?</h2>
<p>But the only functional difference between Tōkyō-to and other prefectures is that Tokyo administers wards as well as cities. Today, since the special wards have almost the same degree of independence as Japanese cities, the difference in administration between Tokyo and other prefectures is fairly minor.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-official-administrative-subdivision-of-japan>Which is the official administrative subdivision of Japan?</h2>
<p>Prefectures are the official subdivisions of Japan. Each prefecture is its own administrative jurisdiction and led by a directly-elected governor. A separate assembly decides separate budgets and ordinances for each prefecture, such as organizing the local police force and the supervision of local schools and hospitals.</p>
