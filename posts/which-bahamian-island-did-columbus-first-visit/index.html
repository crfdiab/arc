<p>San Salvador Island<br>
San Salvador Island (known as Watling’s Island from the 1680s until 1925) is an island and district of the Bahamas. It is widely believed that during Christopher Columbus’s first expedition to the New World, this island was the first land he sighted and visited on 12 October 1492.</p>

<p>6, Columbus reached an island the natives called Bahio, but Columbus named it La Isla Espanola, or Spanish Island. This island today contains Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The name Columbus gave it didn’t last long. The Spanish began to call it simply Espanola and the English named it Hispaniola.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-island-christopher-columbus-landed-on>What was the first island Christopher Columbus landed on?</h2>
<p>The island where Columbus first landed was known as Guanahani. This was thought to be the island later named San Salvador, while recent research suggests his first landing was Samana Cay island. Both these are in the Bahamas. He found the islands very beautiful, but did not find gold.</p>

<p>For the first two weeks of August 1498, Columbus and his small fleet explored the Gulf of Paria, which separates Trinidad from mainland South America. In the process of this exploration, they discovered the Island of Margarita as well as several smaller islands.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-christopher-columbus-live-in-the-caribbean>Where did Christopher Columbus live in the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>Haiti was a French colony at the time of the French revolution. The Bahamas form an archipelago consisting of about 700 islands and islets, though only 40 of these are occupied. A branch of the Taino, the Lucayan, lived in the region when Columbus reached here, mainly in the 19 largest islands of the archipelago.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-voyages-did-columbus-make-across-the-atlantic-ocean>How many voyages did Columbus make across the Atlantic Ocean?</h2>
