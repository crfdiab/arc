<h2 id=why-is-ny-harbor-important>Why is NY harbor important?</h2>
<p>Flowing into the Atlantic Ocean, the New York Harbor is a body of water that surrounds Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten Island and some parts of New Jersey. For centuries, this harbour has played a crucial role in the regional economy and transportation network.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-do-the-bodies-of-water-have-on-life-in-new-york-state>What impact do the bodies of water have on life in New York State?</h2>
<p>These inland water bodies serve as the drinking water supplies, provide flood control to protect life and property, and support recreation, tourism, agriculture, fishing, power generation, and manufacturing. These water bodies also provide habitat for aquatic plant and animal life.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-fresh-water-in-the-world>Why do we need fresh water in the world?</h2>
<p>Clean, fresh water is a limited resource. With all the severe droughts happening in the world, the limited supply of fresh water is becoming one of our most precious resources. Every person on earth needs water to survive. Without it, many of us would get sick and even result in death.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-people-affected-by-the-loss-of-freshwater>How are people affected by the loss of freshwater?</h2>
<p>People are also affected by the loss of freshwater; more than 1 billion people lack access to clean drinking water and 2 billion lack adequate sanitation .This lack of fresh water is one of the most urgent environmental and development issues of the 21st century.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-everyone-need-access-to-clean-water>Why does everyone need access to clean water?</h2>
<p>Here are five reasons why everyone needs access to clean drinking water and safely managed sanitation, right at home. 1. Provides Nourishment Water is life. The sooner those in power understand this, the sooner this law of water being available to everyone can be implemented. Water is the number one source of nutrition.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-to-conserve-our-water-supply>Why do we need to conserve our water supply?</h2>
<p>Conserving water means using our water supply wisely and be responsible. As every individual depends on water for livelihood, we must learn how to keep our limited supply of water pure and away from pollution. Keeping our water supply safe and pure will protect the water for the generations to come. Many believe that our water supply infinite.</p>
