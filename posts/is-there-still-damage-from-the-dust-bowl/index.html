<h2 id=is-there-still-damage-from-the-dust-bowl>Is there still damage from the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>“The high plains never fully recovered from the Dust Bowl. The land came through the 1930s deeply scarred and forever changed, but in places, it healed… After more than 65 years, some of the land is still sterile and drifting.</p>
<h2 id=what-effect-did-the-dust-bowl-have-on-the-economy>What effect did the Dust Bowl have on the economy?</h2>
<p>Prices paid for crops dropped sharply and farmers fell into debt. In 1929 the average annual income for an American family was $750, but for farm families if was only $273. The problems in the agricultural sector had a large impact since 30% of Americans still lived on farms [7].</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-humans-have-on-the-creation-of-the-dust-bowl>What impact did humans have on the creation of the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>Human Causes People also had a hand in creating the Dust Bowl. Farmers and ranchers destroyed the grasses that held the soil in place. Farmers plowed up more and more land, while ranchers overstocked the land with cattle. As the grasses disappeared, the land became more vulnerable to wind erosion.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-dust-bowl-impact-individuals-not-living-in-the-region>How did the Dust Bowl impact individuals not living in the region?</h2>
<p>More than 500,000 Americans were left homeless. More than 350 houses had to be torn down after one storm alone. The severe drought and dust storms had left many homeless; others had their mortgages foreclosed by banks, or felt they had no choice but to abandon their farms in search of work.</p>
<h2 id=which-region-experienced-the-most-severe-effects-of-the-dust-bowl>Which region experienced the most severe effects of the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>As a result, dust storms raged nearly everywhere, but the most severely affected areas were in the Oklahoma (Cimarron, Texas, and Beaver counties) and Texas panhandles, western Kansas, and eastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-dust-bowl-affect-the-people>How did the Dust Bowl affect the people?</h2>
<p>The Dust Bowl killed off livestock, leading to further food shortages. Dust inhalation was probably the most dangerous aspect. The dust was so fine that it was almost impossible not to inhale. Many people, especially children, died from dust pneumonia, a lung condition resulting from inhaling excessive dust.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-rain-stop-falling-in-the-dust-bowl>When did Rain Stop Falling in the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1931, rain stopped falling and a drought that would last for most of the decade descended on the region. And how did the Dust Bowl affect farmers?</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-weather-in-2008-compared-to-the-dust-bowl>How is the weather in 2008 compared to the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>Although the year 2008 began extremely dry, with less than 2.5 inches of rain falling in the first half of the year in some places, the overall dryness has been much less intense and much less widespread than the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-dust-bowl-in-acres>How big was the Dust Bowl in acres?</h2>
<p>At its worst, the Dust Bowl covered about 100 million acres in the Southern Plains, an area roughly the size of Pennsylvania. Dust storms also swept across the northern prairies of the United States and Canada, but the damage there couldn’t compare to the devastation farther south.</p>
