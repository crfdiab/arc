<h2 id=who-built-grand-central-station-in-new-york-city>Who built Grand Central Station in New York City?</h2>
<p>Cornelius Vanderbilt<br>
The first was Grand Central Depot, built by railroad tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt and opened in 1871, which served as a hub for a number of railroad lines entering Manhattan.</p>
<h2 id=do-the-vanderbilts-still-own-grand-central-station>Do the Vanderbilts still own Grand Central Station?</h2>
<p>When the family held a reunion in the 1970s, there wasn’t a millionaire among the 120 members attending. The sole Vanderbilt building that still stands in New York City today is Grand Central Terminal.</p>
<h2 id=was-grand-central-station-torn-down>Was Grand Central Station torn down?</h2>
<p>The building’s construction started in 1903 and it was opened on February 2, 1913. The terminal continued to grow until after World War II, when train traffic started to decline. In the 1950s and 1970s, there were two separate proposals to demolish Grand Central, though both were unsuccessful.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-grand-central-station-in-new-york>Where is the Grand Central Station in New York?</h2>
<p>Grand Central Terminal, occupies a land area of 37,000 square meters located at 42nd Street and Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, United States. It is located next to the Grand Hyatt New York and Chrysler Building.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-did-it-cost-to-renovate-grand-central>How much did it cost to renovate Grand Central?</h2>
<p>GCT renovation plans were announced in 1988. Work began in 1996 and was completed in October 1998. The estimated cost of the project was $425m, excluding the $160m invested in amenities and services within the station.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-they-build-the-grand-central-terminal>Why did they build the Grand Central Terminal?</h2>
<p>Grand Central Terminal arose from a need to build a central station for the Hudson River Railroad, the New York and Harlem Railroad, and the New York and New Haven Railroad in what is now Midtown Manhattan. The Harlem Railroad was the first of these railroads to operate, having been incorporated in 1831.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-architect-of-grand-central-station>Who was the architect of Grand Central Station?</h2>
<p>By 1869, Vanderbilt had commissioned John B. Snook to design his new station, dubbed Grand Central Depot, on the site of the 42nd Street depot. The site was far outside the limits of the developed city at the time, and even Vanderbilt’s backers warned against building the terminal in such an undeveloped area.</p>
