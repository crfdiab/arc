<h2 id=why-did-attila-refrain-from-attacking-rome>Why did Attila refrain from attacking Rome?</h2>
<p>Final Years and Legacy. Dubbed “Flagellum Dei,” Attila invaded northern Italy in 452 but spared the city of Rome due to the diplomacy of Pope Leo I and the rough shape of his own troops.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-attila-the-hun-known-as-the-scourge-of-europe>Why was Attila the Hun known as the scourge of Europe?</h2>
<p>Attila the Hun was the leader of the Hunnic Empire from 434 to 453 A.D. Also called Flagellum Dei, or the “scourge of God,” Attila was known to Romans for his brutality and a penchant for sacking and pillaging Roman cities.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-attila-the-hun-and-why-was-he-so-feared>Who was Attila the Hun and why was he so feared?</h2>
<p>Attila was known by the nickname “The Scourge of God”, referring to his reputation for creating a trail of devastation wherever he went. Attila the Hun and his brother, Bleda, were named co-rulers of the Huns in 434 and the two brothers focused on consolidating the Hun Empire.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-huns-invade-the-roman-empire>When did the Huns invade the Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>Initially, Attila had intended to launch an attack on the Eastern Roman Empire. The emperor changed his mind, however, and decided to invade the Western Roman Empire once more in 452 AD. The Huns crossed the Alps and caught the Western Romans off guard.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-huns-leave-italy-in-453>Why did the Huns leave Italy in 453?</h2>
<p>But the famine and pestilence raging in Italy in that year compelled the Huns to leave without crossing the Apennines. In 453 Attila was intending to attack the Eastern Empire, where the new emperor Marcian had refused to pay the subsidies agreed upon by his predecessor, Theodosius II.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-leader-of-the-huns-die>How did the leader of the Huns die?</h2>
<p>( Public Domain ) Legends say that the Huns leader, Attila, died after a night of feasting – however the exact cause of his death has been debated. Regardless of the circumstances of Attila’s death, the Hunnic Empire soon fell apart. The empire was divided between Attila’s three sons, Ellac, Dengizich, and Ernakh.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-huns-lose-the-battle-of-catalaunian-plains>When did the Huns lose the Battle of Catalaunian Plains?</h2>
<p>In 451 AD, the Huns suffered a defeat at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains. This forced Attila and his men to retreat back to the heart of the Huns’ Empire in Central Europe. There, the Huns regrouped for another invasion.</p>
