<p>continent of Antarctica<br>
The continent of Antarctica can boast that it’s the coldest, driest, and windiest continent on Earth. It also happens to have the highest average elevation of any continent. Located almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, Antarctica is Earth’s southernmost continent.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-always-cold-in-antarctica>Is it always cold in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>The Antarctic is land surrounded by ocean. The ocean under the Arctic ice is cold, but still warmer than the ice!…Really cold, or really, really cold?</p>
<table><tr><th>Time of year</th><th>Average (mean) temperature</th></tr><tr><td>North Pole</td><td>South Pole</td></tr><tr><td>Summer</td><td>32° F (0° C)</td><td>−18° F (−28.2° C)</td></tr><tr><td>Winter</td><td>−40° F (−40° C)</td><td>−76° F (−60° C)</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=which-is-the-coldest-place-on-the-earth>Which is the coldest place on the Earth?</h2>
<p>Technically, Antarctica has the lowest recorded temperatures on earth. The temperatures once dropped to −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F). However, the region is inhabited. Other habited regions on earth that are cold include Yellowknife in Canada with the lowest temperature being -60 °F in 1947, Winnipeg with lowest temperature being -54 °F in 1879.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-canada-the-coldest-country-in-the-world>Why is Canada the coldest country in the world?</h2>
<p>However, during the winters, almost all of Canada receives snowfall and the temperature can drop to 40 degrees below zero making it one of the coldest countries in the world. The air is moist in this country making the extreme cold more bearable. Like other northern countries, Canada to witnesses periods of extreme darkness and extreme sunlight.</p>

<h2 id=where-was-the-lowest-temperature-recorded-in-the-world>Where was the lowest temperature recorded in the world?</h2>
<p>On 21st July, 1983, the lowest temperature of -89.2° Celsius was recorded in the Vostok Station, Antarctica. The Russian-controlled Vostok Station. Many of the places that experience record low temperatures lie at high latitudes. Vostock, Amundsen-Scott, and Dome Argus lie in Antarctica.</p>
