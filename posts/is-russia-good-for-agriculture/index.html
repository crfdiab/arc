<h2 id=is-russia-good-for-agriculture>Is Russia good for agriculture?</h2>
<p>Apart from agricultural enterprises, Russia does offer a good platform for individual farmers. The country’s inexpensive and fertile land attracts not only Russian but also foreign farmers. As such some 9,200 loans were granted to small- and mid-sized agricultural businesses in 2016, accounting for RUB 191.5 billion.</p>
<h2 id=can-foreigners-buy-agricultural-land-in-russia>Can foreigners buy agricultural land in Russia?</h2>
<p>According to the Russian law, registration of an agricultural plot by foreign citizens is impossible. Buy the current agricultural business in Russia with the land (you can buy a company that has nothing but agricultural land); Rent land from the state for 49 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-of-russia-is-agriculture>How much of Russia is agriculture?</h2>
<p>13 %<br>
Agricultural lands occupy 13 % of the territory of Russia (25). Wheat, sugar beet, potatoes and cereals (maize, barley, oats and rye) are Russia’s most important crops (20).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-crops-do-they-grow-in-russia>What kind of crops do they grow in Russia?</h2>
<p>Primary Russian crops include grains, barley and legumes. Nearly half of Russia’s crop exports derive from wheat and winter wheat, classified as grains. Products in Russia derive from different parts of the country; winter wheat derives from the southwestern portions of Russia, while barley grows in northern locales.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-the-products-of-russia-come-from>Where do the products of Russia come from?</h2>
<p>Products in Russia derive from different parts of the country; winter wheat derives from the southwestern portions of Russia, while barley grows in northern locales. Grains, as a whole, remain an important part of the Russian economy. The types of grains produced, however, vary with changes in demand and environmental conditions.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-agriculture-sector-developing-in-russia>How is the agriculture sector developing in Russia?</h2>
<p>The business infrastructure for the agriculture sector is especially underdeveloped including support services, transportation, distribution networks, and financial services. For agriculture in Russia to go through the transformation to a modern system, the key step will be establishing and enforcing farmers’ rights to use land.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-export-sector-of-the-russian-economy-work>How does the export sector of the Russian economy work?</h2>
<p>The export sector has played a significant role in the economy of Russia. Russia’s immense wealth of oil and mineral resources allow the country to export large quantities of petroleum, natural gas, and several mined minerals.</p>
