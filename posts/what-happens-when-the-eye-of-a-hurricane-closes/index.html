<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-eye-of-a-hurricane-closes>What happens when the eye of a hurricane closes?</h2>
<p>A feature of significant hurricanes is the eyewall replacement cycle. Basically what occurs is that a new eye begins to develop around the old eye. The new eye gradually decreases in diameter and replaces the old eye. As the outer eyewall contracts and gains organization then the storm will often increase in intensity.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-eye-of-a-hurricane-move>Does the eye of a hurricane move?</h2>
<p>The eye at a hurricane’s center is a relatively calm, clear area approximately 20-40 miles across. Do not focus on the eye or the track-hurricanes are immense systems that can move in complex patterns that are difficult to predict. Be prepared for changes in size, intensity, speed and direction.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-if-the-eye-of-a-hurricane-is-shrinking>What does it mean if the eye of a hurricane is shrinking?</h2>
<p>An eye will usually develop when the maximum sustained wind speeds exceed 78 mph. It can range in size from 5 miles to 60 miles in diameter, but the average size is 20 miles. When the eye begins to shrink in size, the storm is usually intensifying.</p>
<h2 id=how-fast-does-a-hurricane-eye-move>How fast does a hurricane eye move?</h2>
<p>around 15-20 mph<br>
Typically, a hurricane’s forward speed averages around 15-20 mph.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-in-the-eye-of-a-hurricane>What happens in the eye of a hurricane?</h2>
<p>Inside the eye of a hurricane: Wind gusts increased by the hour accompanied by heavy flooding rain. It’s the most severe weather within a hurricane, and all this wrath happens within the eyewall. It’s by far the most feared region within the storm system, known as the eyewall. It surrounds the tranquil eye with a vertical wall of clouds.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-wind-field-of-a-hurricane>What happens to the wind field of a hurricane?</h2>
<p>Once a hurricane reaches further north and enters the mid-latitudes, the environmental wind field usually becomes southwesterly or westerly, often around the western side of a high pressure system and east of a trough of low pressure, causing the hurricane to recurve to the right and accelerate towards the north, northeast, or east.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-hurricane-move-out-of-the-tropics>How does a hurricane move out of the tropics?</h2>
<p>As a hurricane propagates northward out of the tropics, the environmental wind field often becomes weak, causing the hurricane to slow down, stall, or move erratically, especially if the hurricane is away from the influence of strong high or low pressure systems.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-a-hurricane-to-speed-up-or-slow-down>What causes a hurricane to speed up or slow down?</h2>
<p>Air moving northward on the east side of a hurricane acquires clockwise spin; air moving southward west of the storm acquires counterclockwise spin. As a hurricane propagates northward out of the tropics, the environmental wind field often becomes weak, causing the hurricane to slow down, stall, or move erratically.</p>
