<h2 id=why-was-the-supreme-court-building-built>Why was the Supreme Court building built?</h2>
<p>The building was designed on a scale in keeping with the importance and dignity of the Court and the Judiciary as a coequal, independent branch of the United States Government, and as a symbol of “the national ideal of justice in the highest sphere of activity.”</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-the-supreme-court>What is the purpose of the Supreme Court?</h2>
<p>As the final arbiter of the law, the Court is charged with ensuring the American people the promise of equal justice under law and, thereby, also functions as guardian and interpreter of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is “distinctly American in concept and function,” as Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes observed.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-singapore-gain-independence-from-the-uk>How did Singapore gain independence from the UK?</h2>
<p>Singapore gained independence from the United Kingdom through merger with Malaysia in 1963.
