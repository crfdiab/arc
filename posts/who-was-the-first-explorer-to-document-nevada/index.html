<h2 id=who-was-the-first-explorer-to-document-nevada>Who was the first explorer to document Nevada?</h2>
<p>Although several European-descended explorers would eventually travel to the Nevada territory, the first and most famous to map and document the Great Basin and Sierra Nevada regions was John C. Fremont.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-nevada>Who discovered Nevada?</h2>
<p>The first European to arrive in the area was Spanish friar Francisco Garcés in the 1700s. Few more Europeans ventured into the region until the 1800s. In 1827, fur trapper and explorer Jedediah Smith passed through the Las Vegas Valley on his way to California. He mapped out much of the area for future travelers.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-native-american-tribes-are-there-in-nevada>How many Native American tribes are there in Nevada?</h2>
<p>Thirty-two Indian Reservations and Colonies stretch across Nevada. These tribes are all unique, with traditions that span many generations. But like the intricate strands that form a beautiful basket, these tribes are one, and their culture is strong and tightly woven together.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-explore-the-sierra-nevada>Who was the first person to explore the Sierra Nevada?</h2>
<p>By 1830 the Old Spanish Trail was bringing traders to the area from Santa Fe and Los Angeles, and in 1843 and 1845 John C. Frémont ’s explorations with Kit Carson publicized the Great Basin and the Sierra Nevada region.</p>

<p>The final phase of exploration in Nevada, Emigration (1844-1859), is typified by emigrants crossing the state to reach the temperate climate and gold fields of California, with many of these returning to the western Great Basin region with the discovery of the Comstock Lode in 1859.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-some-famous-people-that-lived-in-nevada>Who are some famous people that lived in Nevada?</h2>
<p>1827 – Explorer and fur trader Jedediah Smith passes through Nevada on his way to California. 1828 – Peter Ogden travels along the Humboldt River. 1842 – American explorer John Fremont finds Lake Tahoe. 1846 – The Donner party wagon train is trapped by snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. 1848 – Nevada becomes part…</p>
