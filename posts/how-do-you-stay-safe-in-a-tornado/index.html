<p>The best way to stay safe during a tornado is to be prepared with: fresh batteries and a battery-operated TV, radio, or internet-enabled device to listen to the latest emergency weather information; a tornado emergency plan including access to a “safe shelter” for yourself and for people with special needs;</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-safety-precautions-for-a-tornado>What are the safety precautions for a tornado?</h2>
<p>Flying debris is the number one killer when a tornado strikes. This is why the first safety precaution is to get inside a sturdy building, away from windows. A storm shelter is always preferable, but if one is not available, a person should go into an interior room on the lowest level of the building.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-safety-rules-for-a-tornado>What are the safety rules for a tornado?</h2>

</ol>
<h2 id=what-happens-just-before-a-tornado>What happens just before a tornado?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseBefore a tornado strikes, the wind may die down and the air may become very still. A loud roar similar to a freight train may be heard. An approaching cloud of debris, even if a funnel is not visible.</p>
