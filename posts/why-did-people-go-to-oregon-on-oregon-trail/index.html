<h2 id=why-did-people-go-to-oregon-on-oregon-trail>Why did people go to Oregon on Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>Determined to spread Christianity to American Indians on the frontier, doctor and Protestant missionary Marcus Whitman set out on horseback from the Northeast in 1835 to prove that the westward trail to Oregon could be traversed safely and further than ever before.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-oregon-settlers-move-west>Why did the Oregon settlers move west?</h2>
<p>Pioneer settlers were sometimes pulled west because they wanted to make a better living. Others received letters from friends or family members who had moved west. These letters often told about a good life on the frontier. The biggest factor that pulled pioneers west was the opportunity to buy land.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-pioneers-travel-west>Why did the pioneers travel west?</h2>
<p>They headed west, hoping to get rich quick. Few did, but many went back east and told their friends about the unsettled country they’d seen. Some pioneers sought fortunes in timber, fur, or precious metals. Others hoped for better health in the mild Pacific Coast climate.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-the-trails-to-the-west-so-important>Why were the trails to the west so important?</h2>
<p>The trail became mainly a route for traders and merchants using mule-laden pack trains. It was considered the most difficult of all the trade routes ever established in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-want-to-go-on-the-oregon-trail>Why did people want to go on the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>Free land in Oregon and the possibility of finding gold in California lured them westward. At the same time, eastern churches wanted to teach American Indians of the Oregon Country their European ideas of “civilization.” Many simply hoped for a chance to start a new life.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-walk-the-oregon-trail>Who was the first person to walk the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>While Lewis and Clark had made their way west from 1804 to 1806, merchants, traders and trappers were also among the first people to forge a path across the Continental Divide. But it was missionaries who really blazed the Oregon Trail.</p>

<h2 id=where-was-the-first-wagon-train-on-the-oregon-trail>Where was the first wagon train on the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>By 1843, when the first large wagon train was organized, a route existed across the continent from Independence, Missouri to the Pacific Ocean. It was an actual trail, mostly connected, created by Indians and trappers.</p>
