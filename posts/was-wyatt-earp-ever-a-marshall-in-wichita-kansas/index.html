<h2 id=was-wyatt-earp-ever-a-marshall-in-wichita-kansas>Was Wyatt Earp ever a marshall in Wichita Kansas?</h2>
<p>Earp immediately left Wichita, following his brother James to Dodge City, Kansas, where he became an assistant city marshal.</p>
<h2 id=what-town-did-wyatt-earp-clean-up>What town did Wyatt Earp clean up?</h2>
<p>Tombstone, Arizona<br>
In 1879, Earp and his longtime companion, the former prostitute Mattie Blaylock, left Dodge City for Tombstone, Arizona. The town was booming after a silver rush, and most of the Earp family had gathered there. Virgil was working as the town marshal, and Wyatt began working alongside him.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-wyatt-earp-kill-in-kansas>Who did Wyatt Earp kill in Kansas?</h2>
<p>The shootout, thought to have lasted less than a minute, left three people dead: Frank and Tom McLaury and Billy Clanton.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-wyatt-earp-live-before-he-came-to-kansas>Where did Wyatt Earp live before he came to Kansas?</h2>
<p>Wyatt Earp served more than one Kansas cowtown during his career. Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp was born March 19, 1848, in Monmouth, Illinois. Earp lived in Iowa before coming to Kansas.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-shootout-with-wyatt-earp-still-remembered>Is the shootout with Wyatt Earp still remembered?</h2>
<p>The shootout and the events surrounding it are still remembered to this day; an egregiously oversimplified remembrance of good versus evil, right versus wrong, and a grim reminder that Kevin Costner had a really difficult time making a good movie there for a while.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-wyatt-earp-move-to-dodge-city>When did Wyatt Earp move to Dodge City?</h2>
<p>He was employed as a policeman in Wichita in 1875–1876 before moving on to Dodge City. An experienced gunman, Earp served as assistant marshal from 1876-1877 and 1878-1879. The Ford County Globe, commenting on his performance, stated: “Wyatt Earp [was] one of the most efficient officers Dodge ever had. . .”</p>
<h2 id=what-did-wyatt-earp-do-in-the-battle-of-the-o-k-corral>What did Wyatt Earp do in the Battle of the O K Corral?</h2>
<p>The Ford County Globe, commenting on his performance, stated: “Wyatt Earp [was] one of the most efficient officers Dodge ever had. . .” A gambler, gunman, speculator, and saloon owner, Earp may best be remembered for his role in the battle of the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona.</p>
