<p>They came with money and resources and divinely ordained arrogance. Just 10 years later, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was a Puritan stronghold of 20,000, while humble Plymouth was home to just 2,600 Pilgrims. Plymouth was fully swallowed up by Mass Bay just a few decades later.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-differences-between-the-settlement-in-jamestown-and-massachusetts-bay>What were the differences between the settlement in Jamestown and Massachusetts Bay?</h2>

<h2 id=what-was-the-location-of-the-plymouth-colony>What was the location of the Plymouth Colony?</h2>
<p>When the Plymouth Colony was founded in 1621 and it was located on the coast of Massachusetts.

<h2 id=why-was-massachusetts-bay-better-than-plymouth-colony>Why was Massachusetts Bay better than Plymouth Colony?</h2>
<p>Massachusetts thought they could rid England of Romanist’s influences and bring greater spiritual vitality to the nation. So you see, Massachusetts bay was much more advanced compared to Plymouth Colony. The people of Plymouth had nothing and didn’t have any help until they met the Indians.</p>
