<h2 id=what-were-the-effects-of-improvements-in-agriculture>What were the effects of improvements in agriculture?</h2>
<p>The increase in agricultural production and technological advancements during the Agricultural Revolution contributed to unprecedented population growth and new agricultural practices, triggering such phenomena as rural-to-urban migration, development of a coherent and loosely regulated agricultural market, and …</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-development-of-agriculture-lead-to-cities>How did the development of agriculture lead to cities?</h2>
<p>Agriculture yielded more food, which made denser human populations possible, thereby supporting city development. Farming led to dense, settled populations, and food surpluses that required storage and could facilitate trade. By reducing these transaction costs, cities contributed to worker productivity.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-agriculture-lead-to-villages-and-cities>How did agriculture lead to villages and cities?</h2>
<p>When early humans began farming, they were able to produce enough food that they no longer had to migrate to their food source. This meant they could build permanent structures, and develop villages, towns, and eventually even cities. Closely connected to the rise of settled societies was an increase in population.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-immediate-and-long-term-effects-of-the-agricultural-revolution>What were the immediate and long term effects of the agricultural revolution?</h2>
<p>How did an agricultural revolution contribute to population growth? Immediate effects: Increased crop fields, more efficient farming, decreased demand for farm lands. Long term effects: population growth, migration of workers to cities. How do you think population growth contributed to the Industrial Revolution?</p>
<h2 id=how-did-agriculture-change-the-life-of-early-humans-class-6>How did agriculture change the life of early humans Class 6?</h2>
<p>The early humans were hunter-gatherers. They moved from one place from another in search of food, water and shelter. The cultivation of crops was a shift as they no longer had to live a nomadic life. These were required to sustain their agricultural way of life.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-agricultural-revolution-affect-european-cities>How did the Agricultural Revolution affect European cities?</h2>
<p>The European agriculture was producing more and feeding more. The advancements were so potent that it made the neighboring nations seem as if they were going backwards in comparison. How did this affect cities? -With the new farmers growing new food and breeding new animals, old farmers migrated to cities to look for jobs</p>
<h2 id=how-did-technology-change-farming-in-medieval-europe>How did technology change farming in medieval Europe?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important technological change that revolutionized farming in medieval Europe was the heavy plow. When the Romans had spread out across the European continent, they brought those aspects of life that were familiar to them with them: baths, gladiator shows, writing, cities, and their farming technology, as well.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-european-union-a-good-agricultural-country>Why is the European Union a good agricultural country?</h2>
<p>Thanks to its varied climate, fertile soil, the technical skills of its farmers and the quality of its products, the EU is one of the world’s leading producers and exporters of agricultural products.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-development-of-agriculture-change-the-world>How did the development of Agriculture change the world?</h2>
<p>Out of agriculture, cities and civilizations grew, and because crops and animals could now be farmed to meet demand, the global population rocketed — from some five million people 10,000 years ago, to more than seven billion today.</p>
