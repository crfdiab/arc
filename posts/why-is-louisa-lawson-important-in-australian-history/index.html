<p>It stemmed from her life experiences. Louisa Lawson was a significant contributor to social and political transformation in late 19 th Century Australia, using what she called the “most powerful agency of the press” to effect change.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-louisa-lawson-when-she-died>How old was Louisa Lawson when she died?</h2>
<p>She was described as “the Mother of New South Wales Suffrage”. Retiring in 1905, but continuing to write for Sydney magazines, Louisa (Albury) Lawson died in Gladesville Mental Hospital on Thursday, 12 Aug 1920 aged 72, after a long and painful illness.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-louisa-lawson-start-the-dawn-newspaper>When did Louisa Lawson start the Dawn newspaper?</h2>
<p>On 16 May 1888, she launched The Dawn, the first journal that looked beyond the domestic sphere to Australian women’s growing public and political aspirations. “There has hitherto been no trumpet through which the concentrated voice of womankind could publish their grievances and their opinions,” she wrote in that first issue.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-louisa-lawsons-son>What was the name of Louisa Lawson’s son?</h2>
<p>When Louisa Lawson died in 1920, most newspapers described her as Henry Lawson’s mother. But it would have been far more accurate to say that Henry was Louisa’s son.</p>
