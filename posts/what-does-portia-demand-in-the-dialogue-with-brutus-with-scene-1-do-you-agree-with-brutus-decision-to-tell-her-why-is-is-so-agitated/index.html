<p>3) Portia demanded to know what is going on. She wanted to know the secrets that Brutus is keeping that involves Caesar. She wanted to know the real reason why Brutus seem agitated and unsettled.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-portia-persuade-brutus>How does Portia persuade Brutus?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-portias-purpose-in-her-conversation-with-brutus-in-act-ii-scene-i>What is Portia’s purpose in her conversation with Brutus in Act II Scene I?</h2>
<p>Portia is worried about why Brutus has been in such a nasty mood. She wants to know what is bothering him. Brutus initially tries to get Portia to leave him alone. Portia convinces Brutus that he should reveal to her the matter because she is his wife and they must trust each other.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-portia-do-to-get-brutus-to-confide-in-her>What does Portia do to get Brutus to confide in her?</h2>
<p>Portia knows he is lying and is upset that Brutus won’t confide in her. She calls on her position as his wife to convince him to confide in her. She insists that marriage is more that just sharing meals and a bed. It is about sharing confidences.</p>
<h2 id=what-has-portia-done-to-show-brutus-that-she-is-worthy-of-knowing-his-secrets>What has Portia done to show Brutus that she is worthy of knowing his secrets?</h2>
<p>What has Portia done to show Brutus that she is worthy of knowing his secrets? She wounded herself. What strange and horrible things does Calpurnia report to Caesar that have been seen that night?</p>
<h2 id=how-does-decius-brutus-persuade-caesar-to-attend-the-senate>How does Decius Brutus persuade Caesar to attend the Senate?</h2>

<h2 id=how-does-portia-know-that-brutus-is-not-really-sick>How does Portia know that Brutus is not really sick?</h2>
<p>He says that we have to think about what other people would think before we go killing people. He also said that we need to be purgers not murderers. How does Portia know that Brutus is not physically sick? Because she is Brutus’s wife.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-portia-and-brutus>What is the relationship between Portia and Brutus?</h2>
<p>Brutus follows the rules of stoicism. Portia as is wife follows Brutus’s lead; therefore, she keeps inside all the deep feeling, tenderness, and anxiety that are aroused in her by her husband’s problems. She even sends their servant boy to the senate to watch and bring her news of the occurrences at the senate.</p>
<h2 id=who-does-portia-want-to-check-on-brutus-for-her>Who does Portia want to check on Brutus for her?</h2>
<p>Lucius<br>
Vulgar. Portia wanted Lucius to tell Brutus that she was well and also check if Brutus was all right. Rude, offensive. 4.</p>
