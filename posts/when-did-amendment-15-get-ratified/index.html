<h2 id=when-did-amendment-15-get-ratified>When did Amendment 15 get ratified?</h2>
<p>February 3, 1870<br>
Passed by Congress February 26, 1869, and ratified February 3, 1870, the 15th amendment granted African American men the right to vote.</p>
<h2 id=did-democrats-vote-15th-amendment>Did Democrats vote 15th Amendment?</h2>
<p>The House of Representatives passed the amendment, with 143 Republicans and one Conservative Republican voting “Yea” and 39 Democrats, three Republicans, one Independent Republican and one Conservative voting “No”; 26 Republicans, eight Democrats, and one Independent Republican did not vote.</p>
<h2 id=when-were-the-13th-14th-and-15th-amendments-signed>When were the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments signed?</h2>
<p>The 13th (1865), 14th (1868), and 15th Amendments (1870) were the first amendments made to the U.S. constitution in 60 years. Known collectively as the Civil War Amendments, they were designed to ensure the equality for recently emancipated slaves.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-15th-amendment-important-to-ulysses-sgrant>Why was the 15th Amendment important to Ulysses s.grant?</h2>
<p>By 1868 it became clear to Grant that African Americans were the most loyal Southerners to the Union and in need of additional protection. By vesting black men with voting rights, it provided stability to the country moving forward.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-ulysses-sgrant-start-and-end-his-presidency>When did Ulysses s.grant start and end his presidency?</h2>
<p>e The presidency of Ulysses S. Grant began on March 4, 1869, when Grant was inaugurated as the 18th President of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1877. Reconstruction took precedence during Grant’s two terms of office. The Ku Klux Klan caused widespread violence throughout the South against African Americans.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-when-the-15th-amendment-was-passed>Who was president when the 15th Amendment was passed?</h2>
<p>As President Ulysses S. Grant took office and argued in support of the 15th Amendment in 1869, the message of universal suffrage within the American Equal Rights Association began to crumble.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-ulysses-sgrant-sign-the-amnesty-act>When did Ulysses s.grant sign the amnesty act?</h2>
<p>By the middle of 1870, all of the former Confederate states had made the required concessions and been readmitted to the Union. In 1872, Grant signed the Amnesty Act, which restored the voting rights and right to hold office of all but a few hundred former Confederates.</p>
