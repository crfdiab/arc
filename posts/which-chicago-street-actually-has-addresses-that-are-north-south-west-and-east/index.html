<h2 id=which-chicago-street-actually-has-addresses-that-are-north-south-west-and-east>Which Chicago street actually has addresses that are north south west and east?</h2>
<p>Madison Street<br>
Addresses in Chicago and some suburbs are numbered outward from baselines at State Street, which runs north and south, and Madison Street, which runs east and west.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-chicago-grid-system>What is the Chicago grid system?</h2>
<p>The Grid is Chicago’s circulatory system: the residential and commercial streets, secondary arterials, grand boulevards, and teeming expressways, the gangways and alleys. It is the system of street naming and numbering that makes Chicago comprehensible and easily navigated.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-zero-streets-in-chicago>What are the zero streets in Chicago?</h2>
<p>A standard block has 100 address numbers, meaning there are 800 numbers per mile. Chicago address numbering begins downtown at State Street and Madison Street, State Street is 0 east and west, and Madison Street is 0 north and south.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-i-80-called-in-chicago>What is I 80 called in Chicago?</h2>
<p>The following is a cross-reference between expressway names and interstate numbers in the Chicago area: Kingery Expressway: I-80, I-94. Bishop Ford Memorial Freeway: I-94. Chicago Skyway: I-90.</p>
<h2 id=what-street-is-2400-north-in-chicago>What street is 2400 North in Chicago?</h2>
<p>Fullerton Avenue<br>
The primary east-west streets can therefore be found at 800 North (Chicago Avenue), 1600 North (North Avenue), 2400 North (Fullerton Avenue), 3200 North (Belmont Avenue), 4000 North (Irving Park Road), and so on, all the way up to the northernmost street in the city, Juneway Terrace (7800 North).</p>
<h2 id=what-street-is-2400-north-in-chicago-1>What street is 2400 north in Chicago?</h2>
<h2 id=is-chicago-built-on-a-grid>Is Chicago built on a grid?</h2>
<p>By virtue of its grid system, Chicago frequently has two versions of each address, one on each side of either Madison (for north-south streets) or State (for east-west streets).</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-names-of-the-streets-in-chicago>Where are the names of the streets in Chicago?</h2>
<p>As in Chicago, there are avenues in Rogers Park and on the West and North Sides, and there is a terrace on the West Side, between Harding and Crawford avenues. The bulk of the streets named after men who are identified with the history of Chicago.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-double-decked-streets-in-chicago>Where are the double decked streets in Chicago?</h2>
<p>360 North Michigan, Mather Tower and 35 East Wacker stand on East Wacker Drive just west of Michigan Avenue and the Michigan Avenue Bridge. Downtown Chicago, Illinois has some double-decked and a few triple-decked streets immediately north and south of the Main Branch and immediately east of the South Branch of the Chicago River.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-diagonal-roads-in-chicago>What are the names of the diagonal roads in Chicago?</h2>
<p>Diagonal roads 1 N. Rogers Avenue 2 N. Ridge Avenue/Boulevard 3 N. Broadway 4 N. Clark Street 5 N. Rush Street 6 N. Lincoln Avenue 7 N. Sheridan Road 8 N. Caldwell Avenue 9 N. Lehigh Avenue 10 N. Clybourn Avenue</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-multilevel-streets-in-chicago>Why are there so many multilevel streets in Chicago?</h2>
<p>The resulting bi-level street has an upper-level riverfront boulevard, a lower-level roadway for commercial and through traffic, and a recreational walkway at water level. The Michigan Avenue Bridge crossing the Chicago River. The multilevel configuration arose from geography and traffic patterns in the Loop.</p>
