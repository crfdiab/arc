<p>5 years<br>
Does OSHA 10/30 expire in NYC? Whether your training is required by law or not, all OSHA 10 or 30 cards in NYC expire 5 years after their issue date. For your OSHA 30 card to count towards your SST requirements, it must have been completed within the last 5 years. SST cards will have the same renewal schedule.</p>
<h2 id=does-30-hour-osha-card-expire>Does 30 hour OSHA card expire?</h2>
<p>Does the OSHA 30 hour certification expire? Similar to the last question, the card issued by DOL doesn’t expire (besides the maritime card) per OSHA rules, but most companies have workers take the course at least every 3-5 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-a-osha-30-card-good-for>How long is a OSHA 30 card good for?</h2>
<p>How Long is OSHA 30 Good For? The small print on the back of the OSHA 30 card that is issued to students who clear the course explains that the OSHA 30 hour certification doesn’t expire. That’s because according to OSHA, the courses are purely voluntary.</p>
<h2 id=do-osha-cards-expire>Do OSHA cards expire?</h2>
<p>While the completion card does not expire, it is recommended to take OSHA outreach safety training every 4 to 5 years to stay updated with the latest safety regulations and industry practices.</p>
