<p>ASL is a fully developed, natural language, one of the world’s many signed languages. It is not a derivative of English; ASL contains structures and processes that English does not (Klima & Bellugi, 1979). ASL is not a “simplified” language, but rather a complete language with its own unique grammar (Fromkin, 1988).</p>

It is not a “simplified” language — it contains structures and processes which English lacks (such as ASL’s rich verbal aspect and classifier systems).</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-ohio-state-american-sign-language-program-do>What does the Ohio State American Sign Language Program do?</h2>
