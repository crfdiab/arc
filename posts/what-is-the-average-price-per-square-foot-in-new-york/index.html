<h2 id=what-is-the-average-price-per-square-foot-in-new-york>What is the average price per square foot in New York?</h2>
<p>In 1997, the average price per square foot was $328. 2017 set the new price record at $1,775 per sqft, then decreased to $1,657 in 2019.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-350-square-foot-apartment-in-nyc>How much is a 350 square foot apartment in NYC?</h2>
<p>A renovated apartment in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood is on the market for $645,000 — for a space of 350 square feet, which makes the cost $1,843 per square foot. For comparison, the typical American home is 2,687 square feet and costs $244,054, according to a 2016 report from the Census Bureau and data from Zillow.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-sf-nnn-mean>What does SF NNN mean?</h2>
<p>Lease Rate: $20.00 /SF NNN (Estimated NNN = $3.25/SF), meaning the base rental rate is $20.00 per square foot per year and the property expenses, which include property taxes and insurance, are estimated to be $3.25 per square foot per year, though they can fluctuate from year to year.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-an-apartment-cost-in-new-york>How much does an apartment cost in New York?</h2>
<p>According to the Corcoran Group, the real estate brokerage, the median price of all apartments in Manhattan is now $916,000. The median price of a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan is $710,000.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-1900-sf-yr-mean>What does $19.00 SF yr mean?</h2>
<p>In the commercial leasing industry, $/SF/year or $/SF/yr means the rent per square foot per year. This would be calculated as $20 x 1000 square feet = $20,000 total (this is the cost for the total year). Now, to get your monthly cost, divide by 12.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-rent-retail-space-in-new-york>How much does it cost to rent retail space in New York?</h2>
<p>The greatest disparity was in retail. While store tenants are asked to shell out more than $4,400 per square foot along Upper Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, they can lease space for as little as $10 per foot in St. George, Staten Island.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-rent-in-new-york-city>What’s the average rent in New York City?</h2>
<p>By contrast, average office rents have the tightest range citywide — from a high of about $82 per square foot in Midtown to a low of roughly $22 in Staten Island and the Bronx. There’s also a remarkably stable ratio between the price of buying a home and renting one in these select neighborhoods. (Click to enlarge)</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-most-expensive-rents-in-new-york-city>Where are the most expensive rents in New York City?</h2>
<p>The most expensive retail rents in the city are found in the Plaza District along Fifth Avenue, which runs from 49th Street to 59th Street and boasts retail storefronts from Tiffany to Gucci to Cartier.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-open-a-retail-store>How much does it cost to open a retail store?</h2>
<p>For 1,000 square feet of retail space, that comes out to $57,333 per month. Costs are generally much lower outside of major cities. Another option is to open a pop-up shop in a temporary location to test your market before you commit to a long-term lease.</p>
