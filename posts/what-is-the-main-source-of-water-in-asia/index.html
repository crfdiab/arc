<h2 id=what-is-the-main-source-of-water-in-asia>What is the main source of water in Asia?</h2>
<p>A study conducted in 2019 found that 79 percent of people in Southeast Asia use groundwater as their primary source of water. This amounts to a total of 346 million people who rely on that water to be fresh and clean. Only 30 percent of the population of Mongolia has access to clean piped water.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-water-forms-in-southeast-asia>What are the water forms in Southeast Asia?</h2>
<p>The Southeast Asian Waters consist of the China Sea, the Java Sea, the Sulu Sea, the Philippine Waters, the Celebes Sea, the Banda Sea, the Flores Sea, the Arafura Sea, the Timor Sea, and the Andaman Sea. The whole region comprises an area of 8.94 million square kilometres, which is 2.5 per cent.</p>
<h2 id=is-asia-water-rich>Is Asia water rich?</h2>
<p>The Asia-Pacific is home to 60% of the world’s population but it has only 36% of its water resources. Per capita water availability is the lowest in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-physical-features-of-asia>What are the major physical features of Asia?</h2>
<p>Asia has a variety of physical features, including mountain ranges, plateaus and deserts. The continent also has fresh and saltwater environments. Steppes are another geographical feature of Asia. Asia is home to three major mountain ranges: the Himalayas, the Tien Shen mountains and the Ural mountains.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-water-problems-in-the-future-in-asia>Are there any water problems in the future in Asia?</h2>
<p>Having run a large number of simulations of future scenarios, the researchers find that the median amounts of projected growth and climate change in the next 35 years in Asia would lead to about 1 billion more people becoming “water-stressed” compared to today.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-in-south-asia-do-not-have-drinking-water>How many people in South Asia do not have drinking water?</h2>
<p>In South Asia, access to improved water increased from 73 percent to 93 percent since 1990. However, over 134 million people still do not have access to improved drinking water. It is currently estimated that in South Asia between 68 to 84 percent of water sources are contaminated.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-water-resources-in-western-asia>Are there any water resources in Western Asia?</h2>
<p>Even less is known about groundwater resources hidden deep underground. The Western Asia region has no clearly agreed-upon boundaries and various international institutions and agencies define the region differently.</p>
