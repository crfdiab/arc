<h2 id=how-often-does-syzygy-happen>How often does Syzygy happen?</h2>
<p>Syzygy occurs when the Moon and Sun are aligned, an event that happens twice monthly. The effect on Earth is that the gravitational pull of these two space bodies is strengthened, increasing the elevation of high tides and decreasing low tides.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-conjunction-and-opposition>What is conjunction and opposition?</h2>
<p>Opposition is when things are on opposite sides of the Earth; Conjunction is when they’re together. The synodic period of two orbiting bodies – in our case, the Earth and an outer planet – can be defined as the time between oppositions (or conjunctions).</p>
<h2 id=how-do-conjunctions-happen>How do conjunctions happen?</h2>
<p>A conjunction is an apparent phenomenon caused by the observer’s perspective: the two objects involved are not actually close to one another in space. Conjunctions between two bright objects close to the ecliptic, such as two bright planets, can be seen with the naked eye.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-two-planets-are-in-opposition>What does it mean when two planets are in opposition?</h2>
<p>The opposition is when planets are across the Zodiac wheel from each other. It’s a challenging or “hard” aspect because the energies are at odds. This means they’re 180 degrees apart, and the pairing is known as a polarity. An aspect is the angle formed between two planets or points in any chart.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-moon-conjunct-mean>What does Moon conjunct mean?</h2>
<p>Moon conjunct Jupiter natal makes you happy, popular and generous. You are the type of person who never has a bad word to say about anyone else and always looks on the bright side of life. Your good nature, charm, charisma, and countless other good qualities bring social success and public popularity.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-planets-are-conjunct>What does it mean when planets are conjunct?</h2>
<p>“A conjunction is when two different planets link up together in the same sign,” Stardust says. This hyper-focused aspect, which occurs when two planets are zero degrees apart, blends the qualities of the two (or more) planets and makes their combined energy in the particular sign they’re sharing extra intense.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-planet-that-transits-the-sun>Which is the planet that transits the Sun?</h2>
<p>Earth, the Moon and Venus are all in our solar system, and they all transit our Sun. But there are lots of other stars, and many of them have their own planets. Planets outside our solar system are called exoplanets. If the orbit of a planet is lined up just right, the planet will pass in front of—or transit—the star that it orbits.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-planets-that-orbit-around-other-stars>What do you call planets that orbit around other stars?</h2>
<p>What Is an Exoplanet? All of the planets in our solar system orbit around the Sun. Planets that orbit around other stars are called exoplanets . All of the planets in our solar system orbit around the Sun. Planets that orbit around other stars are called exoplanets. Exoplanets are very hard to see directly with telescopes.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-one-body-pass-in-front-of-another-in-the-solar-system>How does one body pass in front of another in the Solar System?</h2>
<p>The general term for when one body passes in front of another in a solar system is transit. This term accurately describes how, depending on your vantage point, stellar bodies pass in front of each other on a regular basis, thus causing the reflected light from that body to be temporarily obscured.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-venus-pass-in-front-of-the-sun-it-is-called-a-transit>When does Venus pass in front of the Sun it is called a transit?</h2>
<p>If the visible disk of the nearer object is considerably smaller than that of the farther object, the event is called a transit. When Mercury passes in front of the Sun, it is a transit of Mercury, and when Venus passes in front of the Sun, it is a transit of Venus.</p>
