<h2 id=why-is-parque-de-bombas-important>Why is Parque de Bombas important?</h2>
<p>Cultural significance Since 1885, Parque de Bombas has been, and it is, an important cultural institution in Ponce. It is for this reason that the Ponce Firefighters Corps remains symbolically on this Plaza, in the heart of the city of Ponce.” In 1943, the Firemen Services of Puerto Rico was created by legislation.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-city-of-ponce-known-for>What is the city of Ponce known for?</h2>
<p>Known as the “Pearl of the South,” the Ciudad Señorial of Ponce is located on Puerto Rico’s south coast, and is distinguished by its historical and cultural attractions. It is the second-largest city on the Island (after San Juan) and it’s also known as the “Museum City” due to its abundance of museums.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-el-parque-de-bombas-before-becoming-a-museum>What was El parque de bombas before becoming a museum?</h2>
<p>The Parque de Bombas de Ponce (Old Ponce Fire Station) was built as the main exhibit pavilion for the 1882 Exhibition Trade Fair.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-ponce-or-the-pearl-of-the-south-known>How is Ponce or the Pearl of the South known?</h2>
<p>Located on the island’s sere south coast, overlooking the Caribbean Sea, Ponce is known as the Pearl of the South and is considered the most indigenous of Puerto Rican cities, a place that despite its two hundred thousand inhabitants retains the pace and intimacy of a small town.</p>
<h2 id=what-city-is-nicknamed-the-pearl-of-the-south>What city is nicknamed the Pearl of the South?</h2>
<h2 id=is-san-juan-or-ponce-better>Is San Juan or Ponce better?</h2>
<p>If this is your time, I would strongly recommend staying in San Juan. Ponce is a charming town but it’s more for quick trips, and/or business trips. There’s really nothing to do other than visiting the popular sites, which you can do in just one day. This is exactly why hotels are cheaper in Ponce.</p>
<h2 id=does-ponce-have-nice-beaches>Does Ponce have nice beaches?</h2>
<p>If you came to Puerto Rico for the beaches, then Ponce is an excellent choice. There are 28 beaches to visit in Ponce proper, and 12 more to explore if you take the ferry to Caja de Muertos.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-parque-de-bombas-in-puerto-rico>Where is the Parque de Bombas in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>Location of Ponce and the Parque de Bombas in Puerto Rico. The Parque de Bombas (English: firehouse) is a historic former fire station in Ponce, Puerto Rico. It is one of Puerto Rico’s most notable buildings, with some considering it “by far the most easily recognized landmark in the Island.”.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-fire-station-at-parque-de-bombas-built>When was the fire station at Parque de Bombas built?</h2>
<p>On 12 May 1960, a new fire station was built nearby at the junction of Calle Mayor and Calle Cristina. This new structure became the main fire station for the city, reducing Parque de Bombas to a secondary role. Since 1885, Parque de Bombas has been, and it is, an important cultural institution in Ponce.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-name-of-the-band-that-plays-at-parque-de-bombas>What’s the name of the band that plays at Parque de Bombas?</h2>
<p>The Banda Municipal de Ponce (formerly, the Fireman’s Band), originally played weekly concerts from an open second floor stage attached to Parque de Bombas, now continues its plays every Sunday evening. Called “Retretas”, they are part of a cultural program and tradition of the city of Ponce.</p>
