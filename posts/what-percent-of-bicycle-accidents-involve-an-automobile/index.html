<h2 id=what-percent-of-bicycle-accidents-involve-an-automobile>What percent of bicycle accidents involve an automobile?</h2>
<p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 30 percent of all bicycle accident injuries occur when a bicyclist is struck by a car.</p>
<h2 id=how-common-are-bicycle-accidents>How common are bicycle accidents?</h2>
<p>Bicycle accident fatalities account for 2 percent of all traffic-related deaths, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). However, hospital data shows only a fraction of bicycle accidents that result in injury are recorded by police.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-bicycle-accidents-are-there-a-year>How many bicycle accidents are there a year?</h2>
<p>Traffic accidents killed 455 cyclists in California from 2016 through 2018, according to new data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-bicycles-are-hit-by-cars-each-year>How many bicycles are hit by cars each year?</h2>
<p>A total of 843 bicyclists were killed in crashes with motor vehicles in 2019. This represents a 3 percent decrease from the 868 bicyclist deaths that occurred in 2018. Although bicyclist deaths have decreased 16 percent since 1975, they have increased 36 percent since reaching their lowest point in 2010.</p>
<h2 id=how-likely-are-you-to-die-on-a-bicycle>How likely are you to die on a bicycle?</h2>
<p>How are you likely to die? Here are the odds of dying…</p>
<table><tr><th>Cause of death</th><th>Annual # of deaths</th><th>Lifetime odds</th></tr><tr><td>Pedestrian accident</td><td>5,958</td><td>1 in 649</td></tr><tr><td>Motorcycle accident</td><td>5,024</td><td>1 in 770</td></tr><tr><td>Bicycle accident</td><td>820</td><td>1 in 4,717</td></tr><tr><td>Airplane accident</td><td>550</td><td>1 in 7,032</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-common-bicycle-injury>What is the most common bicycle injury?</h2>
<p>Although superficial soft tissue injuries and musculoskeletal trauma are the most common injuries, head injuries are responsible for most fatalities and long-term disabilities. Overuse injuries may contribute to a variety of musculoskeletal complaints, compression neuropathies, perineal and genital complaints.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-die-a-year-on-street-bikes>How many people die a year on street bikes?</h2>
<p>Sport and super sport riders were also likely to be younger among those involved in a fatal accident, with an average age of 27 (for the year 2005). The number of fatalities of those under 30 has gone from 80% percent in 1975 to 30% in 2014….Motorcycle fatality rate in U.S. by year.</p>
<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Deaths</th><th>Injuries</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>4,295</td><td>92,000</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>4,976</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>5,286</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>5,172</td><td>89,000</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-state-has-the-most-bicycle-fatalities>What state has the most bicycle fatalities?</h2>
<p>By this definition, Delaware is the most dangerous state, followed by South Carolina and Florida, which has the most fatalities per capita. On the other side of the list, Massachusetts, New York and Illinois were among the safest states for cyclists.</p>
<h2 id=is-riding-a-bike-safer-than-driving>Is riding a bike safer than driving?</h2>
<p>But risk-wise dying in a car accident is actually relatively unlikely, though your risk of injury is higher. These figures indicate travelling by car is approximately seven times safer than riding a bike. Both driving a car and riding a motorcycle have little going for them in terms of improving health.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-injured-in-bike-accidents-each-year>How many people are injured in bike accidents each year?</h2>
<p>According to the NHTSA, each year, around 55,000 cyclists are injured in the U.S. where the injuries are serious enough to file a report. Some estimates that these number only represent 10% of all cyclist injuries. Of these, the vast majority are by male cyclists. 39,000 male cyclists were injured. 10,000 female cyclists injured.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-cyclists-die-in-a-year-in-california>How many cyclists die in a year in California?</h2>
<p>California is often first in the nation for cyclists’ deaths in a given year. Bicycle deaths in California make up 4% of all auto accident deaths in the state which is double the national average of 2%. The age of the cyclist is a significant factor in fatal bike accidents.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-injured-in-road-accidents-each-year>How many people are injured in road accidents each year?</h2>
<p>Latest available data is for the 12 months period ended June 2018. In 2017-18, there were 39,404 people admitted to hospital with road crash injuries. The annual rate of admission per 100,000 population was 156.5.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-cyclist-be-killed-in-a-road-accident>Can a cyclist be killed in a road accident?</h2>
<p>These figures only include cyclists killed or injured in road accidents that were reported to the police. Many cyclist casualties are not reported to the police, even when the cyclist is inured badly enough to be taken to hospital.</p>
