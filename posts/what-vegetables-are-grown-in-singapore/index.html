<h2 id=what-vegetables-are-grown-in-singapore>What vegetables are grown in Singapore?</h2>
<p>On top of not requiring mad skills from us first-timers, these seven fruits and vegetables can be easily grown even amidst Singapore’s sweltering heat….</p>

<h2 id=does-singapore-grow-its-own-food>Does Singapore grow its own food?</h2>
<p>Currently only seven percent of Singapore’s food is grown locally. The country imports most of its fresh vegetables and fruits daily from neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, as well as from more distant trading partners like Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Chile.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-we-grow-food-in-singapore>Where can we grow food in Singapore?</h2>

<p>Singapore is a small country with only around 720 square kilometres of land….Number of licensed local farms in 2019.</p>
<table><tr><th>Number of licensed local farms in 2019</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Sea-based</td><td>Fish</td><td>109</td></tr><tr><td>Land-based</td><td>Fish (including 1 indoor farm)</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Leafy vegetables (including 25 indoor and 2 rooftop farms</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Beansprouts</td><td>6</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-export-of-singapore>What is the main export of Singapore?</h2>
<p>Singapore derives most of its revenues from foreign trade. The biggest export product, with 43 percent share, is machinery and equipment. The country also exports petroleum (19 percent); chemical products (13 percent); miscellaneous manufactured articles (8 percent) and oil bunkers (7 percent).</p>
<h2 id=what-fruit-grows-in-singapore>What fruit grows in Singapore?</h2>
<p>Fruits produced in Singapore include durians, rambutans, and mangosteens, while edible fungus produced in the country include mushrooms. There are also farms in the country responsible for the production of eggs, vegetables, poultry, and pork.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-does-not-have-farm>Which country does not have farm?</h2>
<p>According to a recent World Bank report, the countries with the smallest percentages of land used for agriculture today include Suriname, Greenland, Singapore, the Bahamas, the Seychelles, and Norway.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-agriculture-is-used-in-singapore>What kind of Agriculture is used in Singapore?</h2>
<p>It aims to do this through high-tech vegetable farms (i.e. multi-storey hydroponics farms), and through aquaculture farms. By using multi-storey hydroponics farms, land productivity can be increased and energy and water resource use can be maximised. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerabilities to Singapore’s food supply.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-most-of-the-farms-in-singapore-located>Where are most of the farms in Singapore located?</h2>
<p>Most of the farms in Singapore are situated in the countryside region. Farmers in Singapore grow a wide array of fruit crops such as durians and mushrooms. The country is forced to import most of the food consumed in the country. The biggest challenge facing Singapore’s agricultural industry is the limited size of agricultural land.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fruits-are-produced-in-singapore>What kind of fruits are produced in Singapore?</h2>
<p>Fruits produced in Singapore include durians, rambutans, and mangosteens, while edible fungus produced in the country include mushrooms.</p>
<h2 id=what-foods-can-you-grow-at-home-in-singapore>What foods can you grow at home in Singapore?</h2>
<p>For instance, reuse an egg tray to grow seedlings for large plants such as tomatoes and winter melon. This wastes fewer seeds and makes transplanting them into pots easier. Vegetables and herbs such as Brazilian spinach, Indian borage, mint, lemongrass, shallots and basil can be grown at home with leftover stems.</p>
