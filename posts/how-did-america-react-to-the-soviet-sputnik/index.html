<h2 id=how-did-america-react-to-the-soviet-sputnik>How did America react to the Soviet Sputnik?</h2>
<p>Politically, Sputnik created a perception of American weakness, complacency, and a “missile gap,” which led to bitter accusations, resignations of key military figures, and contributed to the election of John F. Kennedy, who emphasized the space gap and the role of the Eisenhower-Nixon administration in creating it.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-respond-to-the-launch-of-sputnik-1>How did the US respond to the launch of Sputnik 1?</h2>
<p>The US government’s reaction to Sputnik’s launch was subdued. Its spy planes had been monitoring Soviet developments, and it’s likely they knew a launch was imminent. “So far as the satellite itself is concerned, that does not raise my apprehensions—not one iota,” declared Dwight Eisenhower, US president at the time.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-relationship-between-the-us-and-the-soviet-union-become-strained-immediately-after-wwii>Why did the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union become strained immediately after WWII?</h2>
<p>Immediately after WWII the relationship between the US and the USSR became strained because? Each country believed that the other one was a threat to its security. Stop the spread of Soviet influence around the world.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-soviets-put-the-first-man-in-space>When did the Soviets put the first man in space?</h2>
<p>After putting the first man in space in 1961, the Soviets went on to send the first woman, the first Asian man, and the first black man into orbit — all years before the Americans would follow suit. In fact, the director of Soviet cosmonaut training wrote in his diary as early as 1961: “ We cannot allow the first woman in space to be American.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-soviet-union-like-during-the-space-race>What was the Soviet Union like during the Space Race?</h2>
<p>The Soviet Union was a famously restrictive place when it came to news and ideological spin, and obviously their attitude toward the United States was less than supportive and warm. The Space Race saw a lot of competitiveness between the two countries, but when the United States landed a man on the moon, the language they used was very universal.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-manned-space-flight-take-place>When did the first manned space flight take place?</h2>
<p>The first cooperative human space flight project between the United States and the Soviet Union took place in 1975. The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project was designed to test the compatibility of rendezvous and docking systems for American and Soviet spacecraft and to open the way for future joint manned flights. Since 1993, the U.S.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-rumored-to-be-the-first-man-in-space>Who was rumored to be the first man in space?</h2>
<p>Test pilot Vladimir Ilyushin has been rumored to be the first man in space. (Image credit: Alamy) “The space vessel reportedly was recovered where expected, but Ilyushin was mentally unbalanced and is unconscious in a Moscow hospital,” said a report in The Spokesman Review about the journalist’s claims on April 12, 1961.</p>
