<h2 id=how-did-colonizers-treat-indigenous-peoples>How did colonizers treat indigenous peoples?</h2>
<p>Colonizers impose their own cultural values, religions, and laws, make policies that do not favour the Indigenous Peoples. They seize land and control the access to resources and trade. As a result, the Indigenous people become dependent on colonizers.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-indigenous-to-the-new-world>What was indigenous to the New World?</h2>
<p>The New World refers to the western hemisphere, especially the Americas, which was almost entirely unknown to Europeans before the “age of discovery” beginning in the early 16th century. Indigenous peoples of the United States are commonly known as Native Americans or American Indians, and Alaskan Natives.</p>
<h2 id=does-canada-effectively-protect-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples>Does Canada effectively protect the rights of indigenous peoples?</h2>
<p>There is no simple definition of Indigenous rights in Canada because of the diversity among Indigenous peoples. In addition to treaties, which are supposed to enshrine certain rights to land, resources and more, federal law also protects Indigenous rights, namely the Constitution Act, 1982 (see Constitution of Canada).</p>
<h2 id=what-were-indigenous-people-forced-to-do>What were indigenous people forced to do?</h2>
<p>Indeed, from the 1830s onward, the indigenous groups were encouraged—at times forced—to give up their old migratory habits, settle on reserves, learn farming and trading, and receive religious instruction.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-treatment-of-indigenous-people-in-canada>What was the treatment of indigenous people in Canada?</h2>
<p>Canada’s Treatment of Indigenous Peoples Was Cruel. But Calling It an Ongoing ‘Genocide’ Is Wrong – Quillette Canada’s Treatment of Indigenous Peoples Was Cruel. But Calling It an Ongoing ‘Genocide’ Is Wrong</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-spanish-treat-the-natives-so-badly>Why did the Spanish treat the natives so badly?</h2>
<p>It should be kept in mind that their insatiable greed and ambition, the greatest ever seen in the world, is the cause of their villainies. And also, those lands are so rich and felicitous, the native peoples so meek and patient, so easy to subject, that our Spaniards have no more consideration for them than beasts.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-australian-government-treat-the-aboriginal-people>How did the Australian government treat the Aboriginal people?</h2>
<p>“In the 1940s and 1950s the Australian Government policy on Aboriginal people changed to one of assimilation.This meant that the Indigenous people were told to live as the non-Indigenous population lived. This did not work because Aboriginal people did not want to lose their traditional culture.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-amnesty-international-work-with-indigenous-people>How does Amnesty International work with indigenous people?</h2>
<p>Amnesty works with Indigenous peoples to develop urgently needed laws to protect their lands, cultures and livelihoods. At the international level, Indigenous peoples have made their voices heard and effectively lobbied governments.</p>
