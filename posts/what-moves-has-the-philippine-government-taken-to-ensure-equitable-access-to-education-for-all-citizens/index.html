<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-private-sector-in-promoting-education>What is the role of private sector in promoting education?</h2>
<p>Increased private involvement can improve pedagogic, technical and management skills across all levels of education. Additionally, its greater management flexibility means that private schools can more easily introduce curricular and programme innovations and improved assessment techniques.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-government-in-education-in-the-philippines>What is the role of government in education in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>The National Government is authorized by the Constitution to contribute to the financial support of educational programs. DepEd is likewise asked to formulate measures to broaden access to education through financial assistance and other incentives to schools, teachers, and students.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-say-about-education-in-the-philippines>What can you say about education in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Education in the Philippines is offered through formal and non-formal systems. Formal education typically spans 14 years and is structured in a 6+4+4 system: 6 years of primary school education, 4 years of secondary school education, and 4 years of higher education, leading to a bachelor’s degree.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-philippine-educational-system-improving>Is the Philippine educational system improving?</h2>
<p>The Philippines has worked to make sure a greater number of children are attending school to positive effect. Between 2008 and 2015, the net enrolment rate rose from 88% to 95% in primary school, from 60% to 66% in secondary education and from 29% to 36% in tertiary education.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-examples-of-private-sector>What are examples of private sector?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sole proprietorships: Plumbers, technicians, contractors, developers and designers.</li>
<li>Partnerships: Legal, accounting, tax and dentistry.</li>
<li>Privately owned corporations: Hospitality, leisure, retail and food.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=is-there-a-need-for-private-sector-to-participate-in-education>Is there a need for private sector to participate in education?</h2>
<p>Education is very important as it makes an individual empowering. Most of our premier institutions of education have been funded by the government (State or Central) and they are all run as not-for-profit enterprises. …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-ra9155>What is ra9155?</h2>
<p>R.A. 9155 is an act instituting a frame work of governance for basic education, establishing authority and accountability, renaming the Department of Education, Culture and Sports as the Department of Education and for other purposes.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-shared-responsibility-between-public-and-private-schools>Is there a shared responsibility between public and private schools?</h2>
<p>Accessible education is a shared responsibility among the parents, government, and the private sector. But even as the State recognizes the complementary roles of the public and the private schools, this principle has yet to be operationalized. We need to legislate complementarity.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-eligible-for-government-assistance-in-the-philippines>Who are eligible for government assistance in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>The programs of assistance under this Act shall be extended only to students who are citizens of the Philippines. Sec. 4. Forms of Assistance. — Assistance to private education shall consist of: College Faculty Development Fund. Sec. 5.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-government-policy-in-the-philippines>What is the government policy in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>— It is declared policy of the State in conformity with the mandate of the Constitution, to promote and make quality education accessible to all Filipino citizens.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-legal-challenges-to-private-schools-in-the-philippines>Are there legal challenges to private schools in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Complaints against private schools are brought into the legal system. The Department of Education (DepEd) and the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) are forced to adjudicate on rights of students and schools like courts of law.</p>
