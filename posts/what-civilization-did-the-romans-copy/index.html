<h2 id=what-civilization-did-the-romans-copy>What civilization did the Romans copy?</h2>
<p>From the Greeks, the Romans borrowed or copied ideas on art, literature, religion and architecture. A prime example is in the pantheon of gods worshiped by Romans. With the exception of their names, the Greek gods and goddesses were the models used for the Roman pantheon of deities.</p>
<h2 id=which-civilization-in-italy-influenced-the-romans>Which civilization in Italy influenced the Romans?</h2>
<p>The Etruscans<br>
The Etruscans formed the most powerful nation in pre-Roman Italy. They created the first great civilization on the peninsula, whose influence on the Romans as well as on present-day culture is increasingly recognized.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-civilization-that-was-in-italy-before-the-romans>What is the civilization that was in Italy before the Romans?</h2>
<p>The Etruscans were perhaps the most important and influential people of pre- Roman Italy and may have emerged from the Villanovan people. They dominated Italy politically prior to the rise of Rome, and Rome itself was ruled by Etruscan kings early in its history.</p>
<h2 id=what-replaced-ancient-rome>What replaced ancient Rome?</h2>
<p>Rome is replaced by Constantinople as the capital of the Empire. Definitive separation of Western and Eastern Roman Empire. The Goths of Alaric sack Rome.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-original-romans>Who were the original Romans?</h2>
<p>The Romans are the people who originated from the city of Rome in modern day Italy. Rome was the centre of the Roman Empire – the lands controlled by the Romans, which included parts of Europe (including Gaul (France), Greece and Spain), parts of North Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-greeks-copy-from-the-romans>What did the Greeks copy from the Romans?</h2>
<p>Another example of the Greek influence on Rome is the pantheon of gods, renamed by the Romans but, in terms of myths and imagery, completely interchangeable with the Greek gods. Zeus was Jupiter and Aries was Mars, while soothsayers and oracles both also appeared in Greek culture.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-civilization-of-italy-before-the-romans>What was the civilization of Italy before the Romans?</h2>
<p>The Nuragic Civilization Before the Romans, Italy was civilized for more than a millennium. The Nuragic civilization appears to have been centered upon the island of Sardinia, where more than seven thousand stone structures known as nuraghe have been discovered.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-ancient-italic-people>What was the name of the ancient Italic people?</h2>
<p>Ancient Italic people. Italy attained a unified ethnolinguistic, political, and cultural physiognomy only after the Roman conquest, yet its most ancient peoples remain anchored in the names of the regions of Roman Italy— Latium, Campania, Apulia, Bruttium, Lucania, Samnium, Picenum, Umbria, Etruria, Venetia, and Liguria.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-renaissance-start-and-end-in-rome>When did the Renaissance start and end in Rome?</h2>
<p>The Roman Renaissance occurred in the 15th century, when Rome replaced Florence as the centre of artistic and cultural influence. The Roman Renaissance was cut short abruptly with the devastation of the city in 1527, but the Papacy reasserted itself in the Counter-Reformation, and the city continued to flourish during the early modern period.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-rome-become-part-of-the-roman-empire>When did Rome become part of the Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>Map of the centre of Rome during the time of the Roman Empire. According to tradition, Rome became a republic in 509 BC. However, it took a few centuries for Rome to become the great city of popular imagination. By the 3rd century BC, Rome had become the pre-eminent city of the Italian peninsula.</p>
