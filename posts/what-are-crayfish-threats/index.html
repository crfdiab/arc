<p>The analysis also showed that the dominant threats to crayfish varied by continent, with the main threats in North America being pollution, urban development, damming/water management, and logging. In contrast, disease and climate change were more important on other continents.</p>
<h2 id=what-states-do-crayfish-live-in>What states do crayfish live in?</h2>
<p>acutus) from northern Louisiana. Approximately 90 percent of the U.S. farmed and wild crawfish production comes from Louisiana, where crawfish are trapped in the wild and farmed as a rotating crop with rice. Crawfish are also farmed and harvested wild in other southern states and in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-crayfish-evolve>How did crayfish evolve?</h2>
<p>Frank Lyko and colleagues sequenced the genome of 11 individual marbled crayfish originating from both the wild and the pet trade, as well as individuals of P. fallax and another related species.</p>
<h2 id=are-crayfish-amphibians>Are crayfish amphibians?</h2>
<p>Crayfish are freshwater crustaceans resembling small lobsters (to which they are related)….Crayfish.</p>

<h2 id=will-crayfish-go-extinct>Will crayfish go extinct?</h2>
<p>The United States is home to almost 400 species of crayfish, about half of which are considered endangered, threatened, or vulnerable to extinction.</p>
<h2 id=does-crawfish-taste-like-lobster>Does crawfish taste like lobster?</h2>
<p>The taste of crawfish is indescribable. There is no other food that tastes like it in the world. Many people think that crawfish meat should taste like a lobster or crab because it is a crustacean, but crawfish is actually classified as a type of fish. However, it tastes nothing like what a fish tastes like.</p>
<h2 id=can-crayfish-have-babies-without-mating>Can crayfish have babies without mating?</h2>
<p>To answer your question, yes they can and often do lay eggs without a male. For example if it is a north american species the female stores sperm for months for use when she is ready to lay eggs and they will be fertilized.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-crayfish-bad-for-the-environment>Why are crayfish bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>The size, aggression and large appetites of rusty crayfish make them a threat to native species, as they compete successfully for food and shelter. They may reduce fish and invertebrate populations by eating their eggs, larvae or adult forms.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-rusty-crayfish-live-in-the-united-states>Where does the rusty crayfish live in the United States?</h2>
<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus) is a large, aggressive species of freshwater crayfish which is native to the United States, in the Ohio River Basin in parts of Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. Its range is rapidly expanding across much of eastern North America, displacing native crayfishes in the process.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-hierarchies-does-a-crayfish-have>What kind of hierarchies does a crayfish have?</h2>
<p>Crayfish tend to form dominance hierarchies with the other members of their population in a particular environment. The largest male will generally demonstrate the most dominance over the others by being the most aggressive, and picking fights with the other, smaller crayfish.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-bigger-a-male-or-female-rusty-crayfish>Which is bigger a male or female rusty crayfish?</h2>
<p>That means that female rusty crayfish can rank higher in the dominance hierarchy than male rusty crayfish if they are larger than them.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-does-a-crayfish-eat>What kind of food does a Crayfish eat?</h2>
<p>As omnivores, crayfish will eat almost anything; therefore, they may explore the edibility of aquarium plants in a fish tank. However, most species of dwarf crayfish, such as Cambarellus patzcuarensis, will not destructively dig or eat live aquarium plants.</p>
