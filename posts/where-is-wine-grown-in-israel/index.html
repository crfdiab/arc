<p>Because of wine’s special role in many non-Jewish religions, the kashrut laws specify that wine cannot be considered kosher if it might have been used for idolatry. Wine that is described as “kosher for Passover” must have been kept free from contact with chametz and kitnios.</p>

<h2 id=why-is-kosher-wine-so-bad>Why is kosher wine so bad?</h2>
<p>A major contributor to kosher wine’s bad reputation is boiling, so it can be mevushal (‘cooked’), and thus handled by non-Sabbath-observing Jews while remaining kosher; not surprisingly, boiling wine, as with boiling anything, kills the complex flavors.</p>
