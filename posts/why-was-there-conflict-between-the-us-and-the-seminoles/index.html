<h2 id=why-was-there-conflict-between-the-us-and-the-seminoles>Why was there conflict between the US and the Seminoles?</h2>
<p>The First Seminole War (1817–18) began over attempts by U.S. authorities to recapture runaway black slaves living among Seminole bands. Under General Andrew Jackson, U.S. military forces invaded the area, scattering the villagers, burning their towns, and seizing Spanish-held Pensacola and St. Marks.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-black-seminoles-come-from>Where did the Black Seminoles come from?</h2>
<p>The Seminoles were largely of Creek origin and lived in villages in northern Florida. The area was also home to a number of Africans, free African Americans, and runaway African American slaves, all of whom were known as Black Seminoles.</p>
<h2 id=what-native-american-group-refers-to-themselves-as-unconquered-people>What Native American group refers to themselves as unconquered people?</h2>
<p>The Seminoles of Florida call themselves the “Unconquered People,” descendants of just 300 Indians who managed to elude capture by the U.S. army in the 19th century. Today, more than 2,000 live on six reservations in the state – located in Hollywood, Big Cypress, Brighton, Immokalee, Ft. Pierce, and Tampa.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-seminole-wars>What was the outcome of the Seminole Wars?</h2>
<p>Seminole Wars, (1817–18, 1835–42, 1855–58), three conflicts between the United States and the Seminole Indians of Florida in the period before the American Civil War, that ultimately resulted in the opening of the Seminole’s desirable land for white exploitation and settlement. Seminole Wars events.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-seminole-war>Who was the leader of the Seminole War?</h2>
<p>Whites coveted this land and sought to oust the Seminoles under the Indian Removal Act. Led by their dynamic chief Osceola ( q.v. ), the Seminole warriors hid their families in the Everglades and fought vigorously to defend their homeland, using guerrilla tactics. As many as 2,000 U.S.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-seminole-tribe-suing-the-state-of-florida>Why is the Seminole Tribe suing the state of Florida?</h2>
<p>But now the Seminoles say the state has reneged on the deal. A number of Florida’s smaller, privately owned casinos – known as pari-mutuels after the form of betting allowed there – are operating such games, the tribe says, by exploiting a loophole in state law.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-war-between-the-settlers-and-the-native-american-indians>What was the war between the settlers and the Native American Indians?</h2>
<p>War Between The Settlers and The Native American Indians. When the Europeans first went to America they were welcomed by the Native American people, who taught them how to survive. Most of the settlers felt they were far superior to the Native People and when the natives died from European diseases they were not bothered at all.</p>
