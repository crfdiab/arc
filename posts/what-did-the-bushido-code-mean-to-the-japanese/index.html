<h2 id=what-did-the-bushido-code-mean-to-the-japanese>What did the bushido code mean to the Japanese?</h2>
<p>Bushido is a code of conduct that emerged in Japan from the Samurai, or Japanese warriors, who spread their ideals throughout society. They drew inspiration from Confucianism, which is a relatively conservative philosophy and system of beliefs that places a great deal of importance on loyalty and duty.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-bushido>What was the purpose of bushido?</h2>
<p>Though bushido varied under the influences of Buddhist and Confucian thought, its warrior spirit remained constant, including an emphasis on military skills and fearlessness in the face of an enemy. Bushido also emphasized frugality, kindness, honesty and care for one’s family members, particularly one’s elders.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-the-samurai-work-for>Who did the samurai work for?</h2>
<p>Samurai (侍) were the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century to their abolition in 1876. They were the well-paid retainers of the daimyo (the great feudal landholders).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-japanese-samurai-fight-for-their-lord>Why did Japanese samurai fight for their lord?</h2>
<p>The first duty of a samurai was loyalty to his lord. Japan had a feudal system, in which a lord expected obedience from his vassals, who in turn received economic and military protection from the lord. During a period of peace, their lord was ordered to commit seppuku because of an altercation with another lord.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-7-samurai-code-of-ethics>What are the 7 samurai code of ethics?</h2>
<p>武士道 is the title for “The Code of the Samurai”. The seven commonly-accepted tenets or virtues of Bushido are: Rectitude 義, Courage 勇, Benevolence 仁, Respect 礼(禮), Honour 名誉, Honesty 誠, and Loyalty 忠実.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-bushido-in-world-war-2>What was the role of Bushido in World War 2?</h2>
<p>But I’m not sure that the valor displayed by Japanese soldiers during WWII was the stuff of bushido. To understand this, first we need to take a look at the origin of bushido, which dates back to the early period of the Tokugawa Bakufu, the military government that ruled Japan from 1603 to 1868.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-word-bushido-come-from-in-japanese>Where does the word Bushido come from in Japanese?</h2>
<p>The word “bushido” comes from the Japanese roots “bushi” meaning “warrior,” and “do” meaning “path” or “way.” It translates literally to “way of the warrior.”</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-editor-of-the-britannica-bushido>Who was the editor of the Britannica Bushido?</h2>
<p>Ken Pletcher was Senior Editor, Geography and History for Encyclopædia Britannica. He holds an M.A. in Japanese studies from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As part of his master’s program,… Bushidō, (Japanese: “Way of the Warrior”) the code of conduct of the samurai, or bushi (warrior), class of premodern Japan.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-bushido-influence-the-rise-of-nationalism-in-japan>How did Bushido influence the rise of nationalism in Japan?</h2>
<p>In the mid-19th century, however, the precepts of Bushidō were made the basis of ethical training for the whole society, with the emperor replacing the feudal lord, or daimyo, as the focus of loyalty and sacrifice. As such it contributed to the rise of Japanese nationalism following the Meiji Restoration…</p>
