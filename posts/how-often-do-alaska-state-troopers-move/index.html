<h2 id=how-often-do-alaska-state-troopers-move>How often do Alaska State Troopers move?</h2>
<p>Troopers are expected to move at least one time in their career prior to having five years of service with us. Many choose to move several times throughout their career based upon their wishes, goals for professional and personal growth and desire to see all that this tremendous state has to offer.</p>
<h2 id=can-alaska-state-troopers-have-beards>Can Alaska State Troopers have beards?</h2>
<p>Grooming standards help the agency maintain a “uniform, neat, presentable” public image, said spokeswoman Nora Morse. Beards and goatees aren’t allowed. Normally, mustaches have to be short, neat and regularly trimmed.</p>
<h2 id=is-alaska-state-trooper-a-good-job>Is Alaska State Trooper a good job?</h2>
<p>As an Alaska State Trooper/Alaska Wildlife Trooper, you will have a rewarding career and receive paid, high-caliber training and benefits at no expense to you while attending the academy. The diversity of available assignments and locations helps Troopers engage in a wide variety of career choices.</p>
<h2 id=which-state-has-the-highest-paid-state-troopers>Which state has the highest paid state troopers?</h2>
<p>California<br>
Best-Paying States for Patrol Officers The states and districts that pay Patrol Officers the highest mean salary are California ($105,220), Alaska ($87,870), New Jersey ($86,840), Washington ($80,200), and Hawaii ($78,720).</p>
<h2 id=can-alaska-state-troopers-have-tattoos>Can Alaska State Troopers have tattoos?</h2>
<p>We do not have a tattoo policy.</p>
<h2 id=do-alaska-state-troopers-get-take-home-cars>Do Alaska State Troopers get take home cars?</h2>
<p>All troopers who successfully complete their field training, will be provided a take home patrol vehicle for use during working hours. Troopers who are on SERT, K9 or other designated standby may drive their take home vehicle for personal use.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-a-montana-state-trooper-make>How much does a Montana state trooper make?</h2>
<p>The Montana Highway Patrol offers a competitive salary and an excellent benefit package to troopers: Salary: Recruits are paid $19.45 per hour while they attend the Law Enforcement Officer Basic Course and the MHP Advanced Traffic Enforcement Course. The current salary for a probationary trooper is $24.32 per hour.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-state-troopers-of-the-state-of-alaska>Who are the state troopers of the state of Alaska?</h2>
<p>dps.state.ak.us/ast. The Alaska State Troopers, officially the Division of Alaska State Troopers (AST), is the state police agency of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is a division of the Alaska Department of Public Safety (DPS). The Alaska State Troopers is a full-service law enforcement agency which handles both traffic and criminal law enforcement.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-law-enforcement-officers-are-there-in-alaska>How many law enforcement officers are there in Alaska?</h2>
<p>They have little, if any local backup; within the entire State of Alaska, only about 1,300 full-time sworn law enforcement officers patrol a state 1/5th the size of the entire lower-48 and other than troopers and state park rangers, the local officers remain in their communities except in extreme emergencies.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-alaska-territorial-police-become-the-state-police>When did the Alaska territorial police become the state police?</h2>
<p>The new agency became the Alaska Territorial Police in 1953, and changed its title to Alaska State Troopers in 1967. The Division of Alaska State Troopers personnel are the general police arm of the agency.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-become-a-wildlife-trooper-in-alaska>Can you become a wildlife trooper in Alaska?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can be hired directly to AWT, although most new Alaska Wildlife Troopers will be coming from the AST ranks after they have reached two years of seniority. If hired directly as AWT, you’ll attend the DPS Academy, then complete a full AST Field Training and Evaluation Program as well as the AWT Field Training and Evaluation Program.</p>
