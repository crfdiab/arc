<h2 id=what-were-the-effects-of-colonization-in-angola>What were the effects of colonization in Angola?</h2>
<p>The colonizers took the natural resources from Angola and sold their products there, thus destorying its local economy system. Significance: This prevented the development of economy in Angola and also took away a lot of its wealth. As a result, there is now a big gap between Angola and Portugal, its former colonizer.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-angola-colonized>How was Angola colonized?</h2>
<p>The colonial conquest of Angola by the Portuguese was a process which unfolded in various stages over almost 400 years. It began with the missionaries in the Kingdom of Kongo in the 1490s and the establishment of colony of Luanda in 1575. In the beginning the Portuguese were mostly interested in slave trade.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-angola-affected-by-imperialism>How was Angola affected by imperialism?</h2>
<p>Some effects of Imperialism in Angola include: Colonial government established harsh laws to benefit from Angola as much as they could. People had to work hard and pay heavy taxes. Arrival of new things provoked the Angolans’ curiosity towards the Western world and improved their level of civilization.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-portuguese-treat-angola>How did the Portuguese treat Angola?</h2>
<p>The Portuguese gradually took control of the coastal area by a series of treaties and wars throughout the 16th century, and their interest in Angola quickly turned to the slave trade. Many scholars agree that by the 19th century, Angola was the largest source of slaves for the Americas.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-portugal-profit-from-angola>How did Portugal profit from Angola?</h2>
<p>Initially through slave trade and later through production and exportation of rubber, diamonds, coffee and then oil, the Portuguese developed an economy that used natural resources of the country but did little to include Angolans other than through forced labor even after slavery was abolished in 1878.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-portugal-imperialize-angola>Why did Portugal Imperialize Angola?</h2>
<p>Disputes over control of trade, particularly regarding slaves from Kongo and its neighbours, led the Portuguese to look for new allies, especially the Ndongo kingdom. After undertaking several missions there, the Portuguese established a colony at Luanda in 1575.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-portuguese-want-to-colonize-angola>Why did the Portuguese want to colonize Angola?</h2>
<p>1. Portuguese government had to spent a lot of money pressing down rebellions in Angola, with led to a financial shortage in the country. 2. Government needs more power to control the colonies efficiently, thus causing a dictatorship in the country. 3.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-angola-in-the-15th-century>What was the history of Angola in the 15th century?</h2>
<p>Angola and slaves: 15th-19th century Little is known about the early history of the Angola region, stretching south from the mouth of the Congo. The inhabitants are living a neolithic existence until the arrival of Bantu migrants from the north, bringing iron technology in the first millennium AD.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-trade-did-angola-have-with-brazil>What kind of trade did Angola have with Brazil?</h2>
<p>Trade was mostly with the Portuguese colony of Brazil; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela. By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact like a colony of Brazil, paradoxically another Portuguese colony.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-bantu-people-come-to-angola>When did the Bantu people come to Angola?</h2>
<p>Based on archaeological and linguistic evidence, scholars believe that beginning in the last centuries BCE, people speaking languages of the Western Bantu family entered the country and introduced agriculture and iron working.</p>
