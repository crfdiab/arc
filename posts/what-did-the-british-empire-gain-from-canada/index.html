<h2 id=what-did-the-british-empire-gain-from-canada>What did the British Empire gain from Canada?</h2>
<p>With the addition of Canada to the British Empire, Britain gained control of a strip of territory along the St. Lawrence River with a population of at least 70,000 francophone Roman Catholics, which was expanded and renamed as the Province of Quebec under the Quebec Act.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-canada-fall-under-british-rule>How did Canada fall under British rule?</h2>
<p>By 1759, the British had roundly defeated the French and the French and Indian War (part of the broader conflict called the Seven Years War) ended soon after. In 1763, France ceded Canada to England through theTreaty of Paris.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-canada-important-to-the-british-empire>Why was Canada important to the British Empire?</h2>
<p>Canada is still a member of the British Commonwealth and has Queen Elizabeth II as its Head of State. Was Canada important to the British Empire? Yes Canada was important to Britain because it provided more men for the world wars, also timber, grain and an outlet for British goods.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-canada-change-during-the-british-rule>How did Canada change during the British rule?</h2>
<p>During the acquisition of Canada under the British rule, St. Lawrence and Great Lakes region are considered as the most populous sites in the country. There were several events occurred which affected the British rule in North America. They include the War of 1812, Rebellions of 1837 and American Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-give-quebec-to-the-americans>Why did the British give Quebec to the Americans?</h2>
<p>British statesmen felt that the former had occurred partly because Americans had not been granted the British constitution in its proper forms. From this view, the thing to do was to give both the new province and Quebec the British constitution in its entirety as far as circumstances might permit.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-newfoundland-and-labrador-important-to-the-british-empire>Why was Newfoundland and Labrador important to the British Empire?</h2>
<p>The two fishing islands located off Newfoundland and Labrador were still under the French rule. Even though the Canadiens were under the British, they were able to practice the Catholic faith based on Quebec Act of 1774. Moreover, the religious, property, social culture and political aspects of the people were protected by the British rulers.</p>
