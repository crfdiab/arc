<h2 id=what-document-influenced-the-declaration-of-principles-from-the-seneca-falls-convention>What document influenced the Declaration of Principles from the Seneca Falls Convention?</h2>
<p>Held in Seneca Falls, New York, the convention is now known as the Seneca Falls Convention. The principal author of the Declaration was Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who modeled it upon the United States Declaration of Independence.</p>
<h2 id=what-influenced-the-seneca-falls-convention>What influenced the Seneca Falls Convention?</h2>
<p>She also was inspired by Lucretia Mott, whom she met almost eight years earlier in London at the World Anti-Slavery Convention. There, the two were brought to the women’s only section and were not allowed to sit or speak at the event. This event and the outrage it inspired led to the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848.</p>
<h2 id=what-document-influenced-the-declaration-of-sentiments-at-the-first-womens-rights-convention-in-seneca-falls-and-how>What document influenced the Declaration of Sentiments at the first women’s rights convention in Seneca Falls and how?</h2>
<p>the U.S. Declaration of Independence<br>
The Declaration of Sentiments was modeled after the U.S. Declaration of Independence and borrowed language from the antislavery movement, demanding that women be given full rights of citizenship. Sixty-eight women and 32 men signed the document.</p>
<h2 id=what-document-does-the-declaration-of-sentiments-resemble>What document does the Declaration of Sentiments resemble?</h2>
<p>the Declaration of Independence<br>
Stanton drafted a “Declaration of Rights and Sentiments,” which she modeled after the Declaration of Independence. In the document, she called for moral, economic, and political equality for women. In 1848, she presented the document at the Seneca Falls Convention in New York.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-declaration-of-sentiments>What was the impact of the Declaration of Sentiments?</h2>
<p>The Declaration of Sentiments had great impact on the social, and political structure of the country. After the document was presented, all women started to stand up for themselves, and it brought health reform, education reform and many other important changes to the women’s lives in the 18th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-one-goal-of-the-seneca-falls-convention>What was one goal of the Seneca Falls Convention?</h2>
<p>Its purpose was “to discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of women.” Organized by women for women, many consider the Seneca Falls Convention to be the event that triggered and solidified the women’s rights movement in America.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-arguments-in-the-declaration-of-sentiments>What are the main arguments in the Declaration of Sentiments?</h2>
<p>The Declaration of Sentiments begins by asserting the equality of all men and women and reiterates that both genders are endowed with unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It argues that women are oppressed by the government and the patriarchal society of which they are a part.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-an-immediate-effect-of-the-seneca-falls-convention-of-1848>What was an immediate effect of the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848?</h2>
<p>The Seneca Falls Convention was the first women’s rights convention in the United States. Held in July 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York, the meeting launched the women’s suffrage movement, which more than seven decades later ensured women the right to vote.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Cady Stanton<br>
Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote the Declaration of Sentiments to dramatize the denied citizenship claims of elite women during a period when the early republic’s founding documents privileged white propertied males.</p>
