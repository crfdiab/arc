<h2 id=does-a-foreshock-tell-when-the-main-earthquake-will-happen>Does a foreshock tell when the main earthquake will happen?</h2>
<p>What is the probability that an earthquake is a foreshock to a larger earthquake? At this time, we cannot tell whether or not an earthquake is a foreshock until something larger happens after it… so only in retrospect.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-predicted-earthquake>Where was the first predicted earthquake?</h2>
<p>On February 4, 1975, an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter Scale rocked Haicheng, Liaoning province. Thankfully the death count was low, Chinese authorities having ordered an enforced evacuation of homes in what is widely cited as the first earthquake successfully predicted.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-foreshock-earthquake>What is a foreshock earthquake?</h2>
<p>Foreshocks are earthquakes that precede larger earthquakes in the same location. An earthquake cannot be identified as a foreshock until after a larger earthquake in the same area occurs.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-earthquake-predicted>When was the first earthquake predicted?</h2>
<p>On June 28 (the date most widely taken as the date of the first predicted earthquake), it was reported that: “the population of Lima passed a quiet Sunday”. The headline on one Peruvian newspaper: “NO PASO NADA” (“Nothing happens”).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-successful-earthquake-prediction-ever>What was the most successful earthquake prediction ever?</h2>
<p>The M 7.3 1975 Haicheng earthquake is the most widely cited “success” of earthquake prediction. Study of seismic activity in the region led the Chinese authorities to issue a medium-term prediction in June 1974.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-prophecies-about-the-coming-earthquake>Are there any prophecies about the coming earthquake?</h2>
<p>The truth is that God has been warning us about this coming judgment for a very, very long time, and hopefully this recent shaking will start to wake some more people up. The following are 11 prophecies of the historic earthquake that will someday cause large parts of the state of California to slide into the Pacific Ocean…</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-earthquake-in-1975>What was the name of the earthquake in 1975?</h2>
<p>But this week’s earthquake calls to mind another, in 1975, which authorities did successfully predict – and as a result, remarkably few lives were lost.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-there-was-an-earthquake>When was the last time there was an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Earthquakes that occurred in remote areas prior to the advent of modern instrumentation in the early to mid 1900s were not well-reported, and exact locations and magnitudes of such events are often unknown. Therefore, the apparent increase in large earthquake frequency over the last few centuries is unlikely to be real.</p>
