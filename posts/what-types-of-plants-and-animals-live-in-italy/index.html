<h2 id=what-types-of-plants-and-animals-live-in-italy>What types of plants and animals live in Italy?</h2>
<p>On the peninsula and on the larger islands, Mediterranean vegetation predominates: evergreens, holm oak, cork, juniper, bramble, laurel, myrtle, and dwarf palm. Although larger mammals are scarce, chamois, ibex, and roe deer are found in the Alps, and bears, chamois, and otters inhabit the Apennines.</p>
<h2 id=what-vegetation-grows-in-italy>What vegetation grows in Italy?</h2>
<p>Natural vegetation in Italy consists of numerous conifer species, deciduous forests, sclerophyllous forests and plants such as orchids, juniper, olive, myrtle, bay leaf plants and oleander.</p>

<p>Natural paradise with flaws Three evergreen plant species dominate most of the landscape of Italy: holly, pine and cork oak. Each region features a variety of additional species of plant. However, the Italian peninsula has been inhabited by humans for a long time resulting in many changes throughout the centuries.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-alot-of-trees-in-italy>Are there alot of trees in Italy?</h2>
<p>Italy now has more forest and woodland than it has had in modern times – 35 per cent of the country is covered in trees. There are now 27 million acres – about 42,000 square miles – of forested land, more than double the area at the end of the Second World War, according to the National Inventory of Forests.</p>

<p>First, around the Lombard lakes, the most common trees are the evergreen cork oak, the European olive, the cypress, and the cherry laurel. Slightly higher, on the mountain plain, the beech is ubiquitous, giving place gradually to the deciduous larch and the Norway spruce.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-italys-favorite-fruit>What is Italy’s favorite fruit?</h2>
<p>While these are some of the largest crops in Italy, they are by no means the only ones. Other staple fruits and vegetables in Italy include artichokes, apples, cherries, garlic, kiwis (yes, really!), lettuce, nectarines, onions, peaches, pears and potatoes. Italian food is grounded in fresh, whole ingredients.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-national-fruit-of-italy>What is the national fruit of Italy?</h2>
<p>The strawberry tree began to be considered one of the national symbols of Italy in the 19th century, during the Italian unification, because with its autumn colors it remembers the flag of Italy (green for its leaves, white for its flowers and red for its berries).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-plants-are-used-in-italian-gardens>What kind of plants are used in Italian gardens?</h2>
<p>Therefore the choice of plants for an Italian garden is clearly just as vast as the choice of Italian cuisine, as Italy’s cuisine is also influenced by the local agriculture that any given area sustains. However, the secret to gardening well in Italy is that of gaining a good understanding of the soils on which your Italian garden finds itself.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-species-of-plants-are-there-in-italy>How many species of plants are there in Italy?</h2>
<p>The flora of Italy was traditionally estimated to comprise about 5,500 vascular plant species. However, as of 2019, 7,672 species are recorded in the second edition of the flora of Italy and in its digital archives Digital flora of Italy. In particular, 7031 are autochtonous and 641 are non native species widely…</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-plants-are-found-in-sicily>What kind of plants are found in Sicily?</h2>
<p>The papyrus is quite common in Sicily as a freshwater plant. The extent of animal life in Italy has been much reduced by the long presence of human beings.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-different-types-of-trees-found-in-italy>Where are the different types of trees found in Italy?</h2>
<p>From the heavily settled and cultivated Po Valley, lying in the shadow of its northern Alps, to its sunny wine country and coast, Italy is a land of climatic diversity. Italy’s different trees and plants reflect varied growing conditions throughout the country.</p>
