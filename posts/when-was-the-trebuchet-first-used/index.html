<h2 id=when-was-the-trebuchet-first-used>When was the trebuchet first used?</h2>
<p>The first recorded use of traction trebuchets was in ancient China. They were probably used by the Mohists as early as 4th century BC, descriptions of which can be found in the Mojing (compiled in the 4th century BC).</p>
<h2 id=were-trebuchets-used-to-defend-castles>Were trebuchets used to defend castles?</h2>
<p>The site teaches visitors about medieval siege engines, in particular the trebuchet, a fearful weapon used against castle defenders.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-trebuchets-used-as-castle-siege-machines>Why were trebuchets used as castle siege machines?</h2>
<p>Defending soldiers also used trebuchets and catapults as a defensive advantage. Other tactics included setting fires against castle walls in an effort to decompose the cement that held together the individual stones so they could be readily knocked over.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-trebuchet-used-as-a-weapon-to-attack-castles>How was the trebuchet used as a weapon to attack castles?</h2>
<p>Siege towers were large structures and often took a long time to construct. As a result, they were usually only used after earlier attempts to take a castle by ladders or other attack were defeated. In general, the trebuchet is a siege weapon that launches projectiles such as rocks with the use of a large swinging arm.</p>
<h2 id=who-predominantly-used-the-trebuchet>Who predominantly used the trebuchet?</h2>
<p>Trebuchets may have been used by Germanic tribes attacking the Roman empire, but more reliable evidence comes from an eyewitness to the Avaro-Slavic siege of Thessaloniki in 597 and from Islamic sources of the late seventh century.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-largest-trebuchet-in-the-world>What was the largest trebuchet in the world?</h2>
<p>The Warwolf<br>
The Warwolf, or War Wolf or Ludgar (French: Loup de Guerre), is believed to be the largest trebuchet ever made. It was created in Scotland by order of King Edward I of England, during the siege of Stirling Castle, as part of the Scottish Wars of Independence.</p>
<h2 id=how-accurate-is-a-trebuchet>How accurate is a trebuchet?</h2>
<p>Put simply, a trebuchet could never hit the exact same spot twice no matter how good its operating team was. Admittedly it still was quite accutate and quite an effective weapon during a siege. Some trebuchets teams were so good they could breach a wall or get in under an hour.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-use-of-a-trebuchet>What was the first use of a trebuchet?</h2>
<p>The placing of wheels allowed the machine to move forward and backward with the motion of the arm and swinging action of the counterweight. The first recorded use of a trebuchet is in Europe in the 12th century. It was the machine of choice for the siege of castles, and far eclipsed the range of the simple catapult.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-catapult-and-trebuchet-come-from>Where did the catapult and trebuchet come from?</h2>
<p>Like many other things, trebuchets were invented in China. They were used by the Mohists as early as the 4th century BC. They were used in Europe throughout the Middle Ages and actually saw use in World War I. During the “War to End all Wars,” catapults were used in trench warfare to lob grenades across “no man’s land” to the opposing army.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-weapon-is-the-crouching-tiger-trebuchet>What kind of weapon is the Crouching Tiger Trebuchet?</h2>
<p>Chinese trebuchets Weapon Crew Projectile weight (kg) Range (m) Whirlwind trebuchet 50 1.8 78 Crouching tiger trebuchet 70 7.25 78 Four footed (one arm) trebuchet 40 1.1 78 Four footed (two arm) trebuchet 100 11.3 120</p>
<h2 id=how-big-of-a-rock-can-a-trebuchet-hurl>How big of a rock can a trebuchet hurl?</h2>
<p>A large trebuchet could hurl rocks weighing up to 160kg (350lb). A heavy rock was loaded into the sling at the longer end of the arm. When it flew up, the sling opened to release the rock.</p>
