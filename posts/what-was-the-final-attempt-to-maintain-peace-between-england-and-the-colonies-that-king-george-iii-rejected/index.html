<p>The Olive Branch Petition<br>
The Olive Branch Petition was adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 5, 1775, and signed on July 8 in a final attempt to avoid war between Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies in America.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-final-petition-the-colonists-sent-to-the-king-in-an-effort-to-have-peace>What was the final petition the colonists sent to the king in an effort to have peace?</h2>
<p>Rebecca Beatrice Brooks April 20, 2016 March 7, 2020 9 Comments. The Olive Branch Petition was a final attempt by the colonists to avoid going to war with Britain during the American Revolution. It was a document in which the colonists pledged their loyalty to the crown and asserted their rights as British citizens.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-king-george-react-to-the-colonists-petition-for-peace>How did King George react to the colonists petition for peace?</h2>
<p>While George III did not respond to the Olive Branch Petition, he did react to the petition by declaring his own Proclamation of Rebellion. This document, issued August 23, 1775, declared certain elements of the American colonies in a state of “open and avowed rebellion”.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-sent-to-the-king-by-the-first-continental-congress>What was sent to the king by the First Continental Congress?</h2>
<p>Shortly before the American Revolution, representatives from 12 of the 13 colonies met as the First Continental Congress to send a protest outlining a decade of perceived offenses by King George III and the British Parliament following the French and Indian War.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonists-want-to-leave-the-british-empire>Why did the colonists want to leave the British Empire?</h2>
<p>Many colonists in the Americas, however, developed a different conception of their role within the British Empire. In particular, because the colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, colonists argued that Parliament had no right to levy taxes upon them.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-a-petition-to-the-king-in-1763>Why was there a petition to the king in 1763?</h2>
<p>Following the end of the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years’ War) in 1763, relations between the colonies and Britain had been deteriorating. Because the war had plunged the British government deep into debt, Parliament enacted a series of measures to increase tax revenue from the colonies.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-colonial-response-to-the-stamp-act>What was the colonial response to the Stamp Act?</h2>
<p>Their slogan was ” No taxation without representation .”. Colonial assemblies sent petitions and protests, and the Stamp Act Congress held in New York City was the first significant joint colonial response to any British measure when it petitioned Parliament and the King.</p>
