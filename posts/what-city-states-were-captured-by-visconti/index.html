<h2 id=what-city-states-were-captured-by-visconti>What city states were captured by Visconti?</h2>
<p>Genoa and Venice remained free cities, but despots ruled Milan, Verona, Mantua, Ferrara, Pavia, and Piedmont. Bernabo and Galeazzo Visconti murdered their brother Matteo and absorbed many towns.</p>
<h2 id=what-city-did-the-visconti-family-dominate>What city did the Visconti family dominate?</h2>
<p>Milan<br>
The Visconti gained ascendancy in Milan through Pope Urban IV, who appointed Ottone Visconti (1207–95) archbishop of Milan in 1262 to counterbalance the power of the ruling Della Torre family.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-gian-galeazzo-visconti-do>What did Gian Galeazzo Visconti do?</h2>
<p>The Italian despot Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan (1351-1402), succeeded in conquering most of northern Italy in his ambitious attempt to place the entire Italian peninsula under his control. Gian Galeazzo Visconti was born on Oct. 16, 1351.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-visconti-family-rule>Where did the Visconti family rule?</h2>
<p>The Visconti of Milan are a noble Italian family. They rose to power in Milan during the Middle Ages where they ruled from 1277 to 1447, initially as lords then as dukes, and several collateral branches still exist….Visconti of Milan.</p>
<table><tr><th>Visconti Vicecomes</th></tr><tr><td>Cadet branches</td><td>Visconti di Modrone</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-did-the-italian-city-states-become-rich>How did the Italian city-states become rich?</h2>
<p>Northern and Central Italy became prosperous in the late Middle Ages through the growth of international trade and the rise of the merchant class, who eventually gained almost complete control of the governments of the Italian city-states.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-visconti-serpent>What is the Visconti serpent?</h2>
<p>The Biscione (‘large grass snake’), also known as the Vipera (‘viper’ or in Milanese as the Bissa), is a heraldic charge showing a blue serpent in the act of swallowing a human – usually a child, and sometimes described as a Moor. It has been the emblem of the Italian Visconti family for around a thousand years.</p>
<h2 id=was-milan-part-of-the-holy-roman-empire>Was Milan part of the Holy Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>Milan continued to be a state of the Holy Roman Empire so that, in his position as Duke of Milan, Philip II was, at least formally, a vassal of Emperor Ferdinand.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-ottone-the-visconti-seek-refuge>Where did Ottone the Visconti seek refuge?</h2>
<p>Ottone sought refuge in central Italy near the pope. The Della Torre party under the guidance of Filippo Della Torre, brother of Martino and his successor after 1263, took advantage also of the favour of Charles of Anjou.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-visconti-become-dukes-of-milan>When did the Visconti become Dukes of Milan?</h2>
<p>Lords and Dukes of Milan. The Visconti ruled Milan until the early Renaissance, first as Lords, then, from 1395, with the mighty Gian Galeazzo who endeavored to unify Northern Italy and Tuscany, as Dukes.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-visconti-family-live-in-milan>Where did the Visconti family live in Milan?</h2>
<p>In 1134, Guido Visconti, son of Ottone, received from the abbot of St. Gallen the investiture of the court of Massino, a strategic location on the hills above Lake Maggiore, near Arona, where another family member was present in the second half of the 12th century as a guardian of the local archiepiscopal fortress.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-visconti-castles>What are the names of the Visconti castles?</h2>
<p>The first of such cases were the Visconti di Massino, the Visconti di Invorio, and the Visconti di Oleggio Castello. In these localities, a castle ( Massino ), its remains ( Invorio ), or a later reconstruction of the initial building ( Oleggio Castello) are still visible today.</p>
