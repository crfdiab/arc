<p>Columbus changed the world because he introduced the greedy, land-hungry Europeans to America. He not only ultimately caused the founding of the United States, Mexico and Canada, but also shaped many other Caribbean and South American nations. He set everyone exploring, and reshaped the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-voyage-of-columbus>What was the impact of the voyage of Columbus?</h2>
<p>Columbus’s journeys to the Americas opened the way for European countries to colonize and exploit those lands and their peoples. Trade was soon established between Europe and the Americas. Plants native to the Americas (such as potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco) were imported to Europe.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-christopher-columbus-discovery-change-the-world>How did Christopher Columbus discovery change the world?</h2>
<p>He not only ultimately caused the founding of the United States, Mexico and Canada, but also shaped many other Caribbean and South American nations. He set everyone exploring, and reshaped the world. It has also allowed for the euro-centric view of the world to be propagated upon millions of students.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-christopher-columbus-go-on-his-first-voyage>Where did Christopher Columbus go on his first voyage?</h2>
<p>Christopher Columbus, an Italian working for the Spanish monarchy, made his first journey in 1492. Instead of reaching India, Columbus found the island of San Salvador in what is known today as the Bahamas. He also explored the island of Hispaniola, home of modern-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-discovery-of-the-new-world-change-the-europeans>How did the discovery of the new world change the Europeans?</h2>
<p>Ideas and Beliefs. The discovery of the New World seriously changed the way that the Europeans thought about the world. They realized that the Bible, which they had believed contained all the information of the world, didn’t live up to their expectations.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-world-changed-by-the-age-of-exploration>How was the world changed by the age of exploration?</h2>
<p>How was the world changed by the Age of Exploration? After the New World was discovered by the Europeans, more plants and crops were discovered as well. These crops were in high demand back in the Old World, and thousands and thousands were needed to be brought back from America.</p>
