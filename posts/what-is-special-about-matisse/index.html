<h2 id=did-matisse-make-prints>Did Matisse make prints?</h2>

<h2 id=how-are-pablo-picasso-and-henri-matisse-different>How are Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse different?</h2>
<p>Around April 1906, he met Pablo Picasso, who was 11 years younger than Matisse. The two became lifelong friends as well as rivals and are often compared. One key difference between them is that Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was more inclined to work from imagination.</p>
