<h2 id=what-is-special-about-the-white-house>What is special about the White House?</h2>
<p>For two hundred years, the White House has stood as a symbol of the Presidency, the United States government, and the American people. The White House is, after all, the President’s private home. It is also the only private residence of a head of state that is open to the public, free of charge.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-facts-about-the-white-house>What are 3 facts about the White House?</h2>
<p>White House Facts. There are 132 rooms, 32 bathrooms, and 6 levels to accommodate all the people who live in, work in, and visit the White House. There are also 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces, 7 staircases, and 3 elevators.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-they-call-the-white-house-the-white-house>Why do they call the White House the White House?</h2>
<p>In 1791, the first president George Washington, selected the site, and the design immediately called for a lime-based whitewash. Typically it was referred to as the “President’s House,” the “President’s mansion,” or the “Executive Mansion.” However, there was also the nickname: “The White House.”</p>
<h2 id=was-the-white-house-ever-called-the-peoples-house>Was the White House ever called the people’s house?</h2>
<p>The White House is known as “The People’s House” — and since 2009, the Obama administration has made that nickname truer than ever before for millions of guests by opening the White House to as many Americans as possible.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-president-actually-live-in-white-house>Does the President actually live in White House?</h2>
<p>The White House is the official residence and workplace of the president of the United States. It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., and has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800.</p>
<h2 id=which-president-actually-lived-in-the-white-house>Which president actually lived in the White House?</h2>
<p>The first president to ever live in the White House was John Adams and every president resides with their family in this historical landmark. Every president except George Washington lived in the White House.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-so-special-about-the-white-house>What is so special about the White House?</h2>
<p>The only private residence of a head of state open free of charge to the public, the White House reflects a nation’s history through the accumulated collections of its residing presidents, and serves as a worldwide symbol of the American republic.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-white-house-get-its-name>How did the White House get its name?</h2>
<p>The White House obtained its name because it was repainted white after the British burned it in 1814.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-white-called-the-white-house>Why is the White called the White House?</h2>
<p>That is a large amount of surface area and a correspondingly large amount of paint to paint it. In any event, now you know why the White House is called the White House. Although it is called the White House and is well known by that name, the official name is still the Executive Mansion.</p>
