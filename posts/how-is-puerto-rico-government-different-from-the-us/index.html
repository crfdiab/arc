<h2 id=how-is-puerto-rico-government-different-from-the-us>How is Puerto Rico government different from the US?</h2>
<p>The political status of Puerto Rico is that of an unincorporated territory of the United States. As such, the island of Puerto Rico is neither a sovereign nation nor a U.S. state. On the other hand, in contrast to U.S. states, only some residents of Puerto Rico are subject to federal income taxes.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-puerto-rico-affect-the-us>How did Puerto Rico affect the US?</h2>
<p>In 1917, the U.S. Congress passed the Jones Act, which brought Puerto Rico the first significant political changes under U.S. colonial rule. With this law, Congress established a popularly elected legislative branch (a Senate and a House of Representatives) and extended American citizenship to Puerto Rican citizens.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-territory-become-a-state-in-the-united-states>How does a territory become a state in the United States?</h2>
<p>In most cases, the organized government of a territory made known the sentiment of its population in favor of statehood, usually by referendum. Upon acceptance of that constitution, by the people of the territory and then by Congress, Congress would adopt by simple majority vote a joint resolution granting statehood.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-puerto-rican-latino-or-hispanic>Is a Puerto Rican Latino or Hispanic?</h2>
<p>OMB defines “Hispanic or Latino” as a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-puerto-rico-not-a-us-state>Why is Puerto Rico not a US state?</h2>
<p>Yet despite their citizenship, which enables them to serve in the American Army, Puerto Ricans are limited in the benefits they receive as U.S. citizens. They receive limited federal funding and are unable to vote in U.S. federal elections. It’s long been asked why Puerto Rico shouldn’t become a U.S. state.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-puerto-rico-become-the-51st-state>When did Puerto Rico become the 51st state?</h2>
<p>should puerto rico become the 51st state? Puerto Rico became a U.S. territory in 1898 as a result of the Spanish-American War, and thanks to the Jones Act of 1917, babies born in Puerto Rico are automatically granted U.S. citizenship.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-puerto-rico-being-part-of-the-us>What are the advantages and disadvantages of Puerto Rico being part of the US?</h2>
<p>A lot of the citizens of Puerto Rico are living under the poverty line. When the country becomes part of the US, a lot of job opportunities would present itself for the residents. Even though the island nation is a territory of the United States, it enjoys limited benefits. Even the country’s representative in Congress is a nonvoting delegate.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-options-for-statehood-in-puerto-rico>What are the options for statehood in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>The previous plebiscites provided voters with three options: statehood, free association, and independence. The Puerto Rican status referendum of 2017 originally offered only two options: Statehood and Independence/Free Association, however a “current territorial status” was added before the referendum took place.</p>
