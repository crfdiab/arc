<h2 id=what-are-some-physical-features-of-arctic-lowlands>What are some physical features of Arctic Lowlands?</h2>
<p>The Arctic Lowlands, which form part of the Arctic Archipelago, lie between the Canadian Shield and the Innuitian Region. This region contains lowland plains with glacial moraines in the west and uplands with plateaus and rocky hills in the east.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-arctic-lowlands-made-of>What are the Arctic lowlands made of?</h2>
<p>This region is a tundra and has poorly drained soil, cold plains, no trees and minimum vegetation. It was formed with eroded material from the shield that gradually formed into rock over the years. They formed when the glacier sunk the Canadian shield. In the Arctic Lowlands you can find lignite, oil and natural gas.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-physical-features-of-arctic-lands>What are the physical features of Arctic lands?</h2>
<p>Conditions typical of Arctic lands are extreme fluctuations between summer and winter temperatures; permanent snow and ice in the high country and grasses, sedges, and low shrubs in the lowlands; and permanently frozen ground (permafrost), the surface layer of which is subject to summer thawing.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-arctic-landform>What is the Arctic landform?</h2>
<p>The Arctic includes the peaks of the Brooks mountain range in western North America, the enormous Greenland ice sheet, the isolated islands of the Svalbard archipelago, the fjords of northern Scandinavia, and the grassland plateaus and rich river valleys of northern Siberia.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-arctic-lowlands-known-for>What is Arctic lowlands known for?</h2>
<p>Physical Characteristics (Arctic Lowlands) The Arctic Lowlands have long, cold winters and short cool summers. This polar environment has extremely long nights in winter that last up to 3-4 months, and the same for daylight in the summer.</p>
<h2 id=who-lives-in-the-arctic-lowlands>Who lives in the Arctic lowlands?</h2>
<p>The common animals that can be found in Canadian Arctic region are arctic fox, caribou, musk-ox, polar bear, seal and whales. The extremely cold temperature has limited the activities of these arctic mammals; especially the species live on land, such as polar bear and arctic fox.</p>

<h2 id=what-are-the-physical-characteristics-of-the-arctic-lowlands>What are the physical characteristics of the Arctic Lowlands?</h2>

<h2 id=how-are-the-hudson-bay-and-arctic-lowlands-alike>How are the Hudson Bay and Arctic lowlands alike?</h2>
<p>Physical Landscape The Hudson Bay lowlands consists of swampy plains and lots of small lakes and ponds, while the Arctic lowlands are made of islands with gently rolling hills. Both are made of mainly sedimentary rocks, along with igneous and metamorphic rocks.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-live-in-the-arctic-lowlands>What kind of animals live in the Arctic Lowlands?</h2>
<p>Limestone is very abundant as well. The Arctic Lowlands have a small human population. The terrain is mostly ice, snow, rock, and it is full of marshes, especially in the winter. Animals that live in the area include polar bears, char, Arctic hares and Arctic foxes. This region is being affected by global warming.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-arctic-lowlands-located-in-canada>Where are the Arctic Lowlands located in Canada?</h2>
<p>The Arctic Lowlands are plains located in Canada. Plains are extensive areas of level or gently rolling land. In North America there is a large, flat interior Plain. They are also part of an area that is commonly referred to as the Arctic Archipelago, which occupies much of the central Canadian Arctic.</p>
