<h2 id=does-the-national-anthem-of-spain-have-words>Does the national anthem of Spain have words?</h2>
<p>The Spanish national anthem, known as the “Royal March,” is one of the few in the world that does not contain any lyrics and Spaniards often hum or just stand silent when it is played.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-spain-national-song>What is Spain national song?</h2>
<p>Marcha Real<br>
Spain’s national anthem, the ‘Marcha Real’, is one of the few patriotic songs with no lyrics at all. The Royal March is in the no-text club with just three other countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and San Marino.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-flag-of-spain-called>What is the flag of Spain called?</h2>
<p>Rojigualda<br>
Flag of Spain</p>

<h2 id=what-language-is-the-swiss-national-anthem>What language is the Swiss national anthem?</h2>
<p>CALLED the Swiss Palm, the national anthem was composed in 1841 but wasn’t adopted until 1961. Originally written in German, it has been translated into Italian, French and Romansh. It is sung in whatever language you speak and the Swiss government have plans to change it.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-national-anthem-has-no-lyrics>Which country national anthem has no lyrics?</h2>
<p>And even having a national anthem without words can cause problems: Spain’s Marcha Real (Royal March) is one of only four anthems to have no official lyrics, the others being those of San Marino, Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzogovina.</p>
<h2 id=which-national-anthem-is-the-best>Which national anthem is the best?</h2>
<p>The best national anthems</p>
<ul>
<li>Russia.</li>
<li>Switzerland.</li>
<li>Japan.</li>
<li>USA.</li>
<li>Germany.</li>
<li>France. A classic tune – with all the force of a Zinadine Zidane head-butt.</li>
<li>Italy. “You could imagine Rossini writing that,” says David of the Italian national anthem.</li>
<li>Wales. Land of my Fathers, David says, “is the kind of tune that makes me wish I was Welsh.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=which-country-started-national-anthem-first>Which country started national anthem first?</h2>
<p>The oldest national anthem is Great Britain’s “God Save the Queen,” which was described as a national anthem in 1825, although it had been popular as a patriotic song and used on occasions of royal ceremonial since the mid-18th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-national-anthem-of-spain>What is the name of the national anthem of Spain?</h2>
<p>La marcha real (“The Royal March”) is the national anthem of Spain. It is one of the few national anthems in the world to have no official lyrics.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-marcha-granadera-the-national-anthem-of-spain>Why is the Marcha Granadera the national anthem of Spain?</h2>
<p>Because it was always played at public events attended by the royal family, Spaniards soon came to regard the Marcha Granadera as their national anthem and called it the Marcha Real, or “Royal March”. Under the Second Spanish Republic (19311939), El Himno de Riego replaced La Marcha Real as the national anthem of Spain.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-countries-that-do-not-have-the-national-anthem>Are there any countries that do not have the national anthem?</h2>
<p>There are several countries that do not have official lyrics to their national anthems. One of these is the “Marcha Real”, the national anthem of Spain. Although it originally had lyrics those lyrics were discontinued after governmental changes in the early 1980s after Francisco Franco’s dictatorship ended.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spanish-national-anthem-change-during-the-civil-war>How did the Spanish national anthem change during the Civil War?</h2>
<p>Therefore, it was not invented during the Civil War; as is often claimed. However, that Spanish anthem underwent changes in its lyrics, such as: “raise your forehead” for “raise your arms”, “the anvils and wheels” for “the yokes and arrows”, adapting to the rebel side and the future political regime born after the war.</p>
