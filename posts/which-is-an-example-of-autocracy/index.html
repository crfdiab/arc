<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-autocracy>Which is an example of autocracy?</h2>
<p>An autocracy is a system of government in which one person—an autocrat—holds all political, economic, social, and military power. Today, most autocracies exist in the form of absolute monarchies, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Morocco, and dictatorships, such as North Korea, Cuba, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-autocracy-and-why-was-this-important>What is autocracy and why was this important?</h2>
<p>As we learned in this lesson, an autocracy is a form of leadership where all power is concentrated in the hands of a single leader or ruling group. In some situations, such as on the battlefield or during a disaster, autocracy is beneficial because it allows for quick decisions and a clear chain of command.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-an-autocracy-work>How does an autocracy work?</h2>
<p>Definition: Autocratic leadership is a management style wherein one person controls all the decisions and takes very little inputs from other group members. Autocratic leaders make choices or decisions based on their own beliefs and do not involve others for their suggestion or advice.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-definition-of-the-word-autocracy>Which is the best definition of the word autocracy?</h2>
<p>noun, plural au·toc·ra·cies. government in which one person has uncontrolled or unlimited authority over others; the government or power of an absolute monarch. a nation, state, or community ruled by an autocrat. unlimited authority, power, or influence of one person in any group. Think you remember last week’s words?</p>
<h2 id=who-is-held-in-power-in-an-autocracy>Who is held in power in an autocracy?</h2>
<p>In an autocracy, political power is held by a person who can control most or all aspects of people’s lives. Autocrats can be called dictators or emperors. In the past, Egyptian pharaohs were a kind of autocrat for that society. Other people can play an important role in helping to maintain the power of an autocrat.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-autocracy-democracy-and-oligarchy>What’s the difference between autocracy, democracy and oligarchy?</h2>
<p>Autocracy, democracy and oligarchy are terms used to define different systems of government. The systems defined by these terms range from a government in which one person makes all decisions to a government in which decisions are made by all people. Autocracy is “rule by one.”</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-autocracy>What are the advantages and disadvantages of autocracy?</h2>
<p>Autocracy. The advantages of an autocratic government are that decisions can be made and implemented quickly. However, individual rights are usually ignored and power is often maintained by force. Some autocracies are theocratic governments, in which the ruler claims to have been put in power by a deity.</p>
