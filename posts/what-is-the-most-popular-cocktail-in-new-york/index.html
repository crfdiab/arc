<p>The Abrupt Halt of To-Go Cocktails Leaves New York Bars Reeling. A financial lifeline for many restaurants during the pandemic, to-go cocktails are no more as of Friday, after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo abruptly ended New York’s coronavirus emergency order, and the state’s liquor authority shut down off-premises rights.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-tri-boroughs-in-new-york>What are the Tri boroughs in New York?</h2>
<p>Triborough Bridge, a complex of three bridges connecting the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Bronx, and Queens. “Tri-Borough” (CSI: NY), an episode of CSI: NY.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-walk-around-with-alcohol-in-new-york>Can you walk around with alcohol in New York?</h2>
<p>Is outdoor drinking legal in New York right now? Technically, no—it never was, according to Cuomo. As things stand right now, if you want to order to-go cocktails, you’ll have to get food with them.</p>
<h2 id=is-alcohol-delivery-allowed-in-new-york>Is alcohol delivery allowed in New York?</h2>
<p>Following the announcement, the New York State Liquor Authority tweeted that “…with the ending of our state of emergency and the return to pre-pandemic guidelines, the temporary pandemic-related privileges for to-go and delivery of alcoholic beverages will end after June 24.” A spokesperson for the SLA confirmed to …</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-cocktails-named-after-new-york-city-boroughs>Are there any cocktails named after New York City boroughs?</h2>
<p>New York City has a whole line up of cocktails named after the boroughs. The Manhattan is probably the most famous of those — borough-wise and cocktail-wise. It’s a mix of rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters and then garnished with a cherry. The northernmost borough in New York City borrows a lot from the perfect martini.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-whiskey-is-in-a-brooklyn-cocktail>What kind of whiskey is in a Brooklyn cocktail?</h2>
<p>And like its namesake borough, the Brooklyn cocktail serves up a bold punch of flavor with a bit of eclectic flair, combining two spirits that don’t often (intentionally) go together: rye and vermouth. Directions: Mix 1 oz. rye whiskey with 1/2 oz. dry vermouth, 1/4 oz. cherry-flavored liquor and a dash of Angostura bitters.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn It only makes sense for one of New York City’s most famous boroughs to have its own famous New-York-themed cocktail. And like its namesake borough, the Brooklyn cocktail serves up a bold punch of flavor with a bit of eclectic flair, combining two spirits that don’t often (intentionally) go together: rye and vermouth.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-whiskey-is-in-a-manhattan>What kind of whiskey is in a Manhattan?</h2>
<p>Frustratingly the recipes in the early bar books above simply state ‘whiskey’ but the Manhattan was probably originally made with rye whiskey, rather than bourbon, as New York was a rye-drinking city. Today it is common to use bourbon, although purists tend to favour bonded rye whiskey. Some folks even prefer Tennessee or Canadian whiskey.</p>
