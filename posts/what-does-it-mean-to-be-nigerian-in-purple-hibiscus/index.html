<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-be-nigerian-in-purple-hibiscus>What does it mean to be Nigerian in Purple Hibiscus?</h2>
<p>In Purple Hibiscus, Papa-Nnukwu represents indigenous culture, specifically that of Igboland. Papa-Nnukwu is the father of Eugene and Ifeoma. It is this culture, combined with the colonizing culture, that has created the sibling futures of Nigeria that Eugene and Ifeoma represent: autocracy and democracy.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-title-purple-hibiscus-relate-to-the-story>How does the title Purple Hibiscus relate to the story?</h2>
<p>The purple hibiscus, the symbol that gives the novel its title, is a flower growing in Aunty Ifeoma’s garden. Because of its role in Jaja and Kambili’s mental awakening, the purple hibiscus comes to represent freedom and individuality—things they lack under Papa’s rule, but find in Nsukka with Aunty Ifeoma.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-theme-in-purple-hibiscus>What is the theme in Purple Hibiscus?</h2>
<p>The forces of tyranny, oppression, and silence all use violence as their tool throughout Purple Hibiscus. As with many of Adichie’s themes, the cycle of violence starts at the top and works its way down.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-point-of-view-of-purple-hibiscus>What is the point of view of Purple Hibiscus?</h2>
<p>Purple Hibiscus is written in first person point-of-view of a 15-year-old girl, Kambili. Because it is written in first person point-of-view, it is easier for readers to listen to what the narrator is thinking and experience what the narrator is going through.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-purple-hibiscus-rare>Is a purple hibiscus rare?</h2>
<p>Read and annotate the excerpt from “A Critical Examination of the Role of Nature and Culture in Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus” by Isabella Akinseye (on reverse side of page) Page 2 “The purple hibiscus flower is an uncommon and experimental hybrid species of the hibiscus plant which was discovered by …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-theme-of-adichie-purple-hibiscus-and-what-does-it-symbolize>What is the main theme of Adichie purple hibiscus and what does it symbolize?</h2>
<p>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus tells the story of a young Nigerian girl, Kambili, and her family. Throughout the novel, the author wrestles with themes of identity, freedom, oppression, love, and tradition as she explores the tensions within Kambili’s family and within the country of Nigeria itself.</p>
<h2 id=which-character-transformed-the-most-in-purple-hibiscus>Which character transformed the most in purple hibiscus?</h2>
<p>Of those people, there were three individuals who helped Kambili the most in her transformation. Those three characters are Amaka, Papa Nnukwu, and Father Amadi.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-mama-kill-papa-in-purple-hibiscus>Why did mama kill Papa in purple hibiscus?</h2>
<p>The main reason Mama put poison in his tea was to set them free from his hold as Papa never let them make their own opinions and made Kambili in a way dependent on him. At this point of the book Jaja and Kambili have grown as people and Mama can see this.</p>
<h2 id=is-purple-hibiscus-a-true-story>Is Purple Hibiscus a true story?</h2>
<p>Purple Hibiscus draws on certain aspects of her background – her home town and her Catholicism, for example – but it is very far from autobiographical. It is an evocative and moving portrayal of a childhood in a fanatically religious household, one ruled by a charismatic and violent Catholic patriarch.</p>
<h2 id=is-purple-hibiscus-a-feminist-novel>Is Purple Hibiscus a feminist novel?</h2>
<p>Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus is a feminist work that challenges the tendency of men to dehumanise women, and this is evident in the character of Mama (Beatrice Achike), who exposes the African concept of an ideal woman; one who stays silent in the face of humiliation, victimization, and brutality, so as to be perceived as …</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-purple-hibiscus-mean-in-nigeria>What does the Purple Hibiscus mean in Nigeria?</h2>
<p>Adichie briefly introduces the purple hibiscus as a symbol of freedom and independence, while also referencing the theme of silence and speech and bringing up Nigerian politics.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-track-the-themes-in-purple-hibiscus>How to track the themes in Purple Hibiscus?</h2>
<p>LitCharts assigns a color and icon to each theme in Purple Hibiscus, which you can use to track the themes throughout the work.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-silence-in-purple-hibiscus>What is the meaning of silence in Purple Hibiscus?</h2>
<p>Silence is associated with the fear of Papa that Mama, Kambili, and Jaja experience at all times. Kambili, especially, rarely speaks, because… The forces of tyranny, oppression, and silence all use violence as their tool throughout Purple Hibiscus. As with many of Adichie’s themes, the cycle of violence starts at the top and works its way down.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-purple-hibiscus-important-to-kambili>Why was the Purple Hibiscus important to Kambili?</h2>
<p>This was a different kind of freedom from the one Kambili had heard angry crowds chanting for—this was “a freedom to be, to do.” Adichie briefly introduces the purple hibiscus as a symbol of freedom and independence, while also referencing the theme of silence and speech and bringing up Nigerian politics.</p>
