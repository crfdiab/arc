<h2 id=what-is-ctesiphon-called-today>What is Ctesiphon called today?</h2>
<p>Ctesiphon, also spelled Tusbun, or Taysafun, ancient city located on the left (northeast) bank of the Tigris River about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of modern Baghdad, in east-central Iraq.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-ctesiphon-important>Why is Ctesiphon important?</h2>
<p>The city became an important center for trade along the Silk Road. Ctesiphon thus became known as the terminus for one of the many branches of the Silk Road. It was conquered by the Romans three times and was the site of the Battle of Ctesiphon between Ardashir I and Alexander Severus of Rome (r. 222-235 CE) in 233 CE.</p>
<h2 id=who-destroyed-ctesiphon>Who destroyed Ctesiphon?</h2>
<p>Ctesiphon became the Parthian capital most likely in the first century B.C., and served as the Arsacid rulers’ winter residence until the fall of the dynasty in 224 A.D. Key events during the Parthian period include three major Roman invasions: the emperor Trajan conquered Ctesiphon in 116 A.D., the Roman general …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-ctesiphon>What is the meaning of Ctesiphon?</h2>
<p>noun. a ruined city in Iraq, on the Tigris, near Baghdad: an ancient capital of Parthia.</p>
<h2 id=does-ctesiphon-still-exist>Does Ctesiphon still exist?</h2>
<p>During the Roman–Parthian Wars, Ctesiphon fell three times to the Romans, and later fell twice during Sasanian rule. It was also the site of the Battle of Ctesiphon in 363 AD. The most conspicuous structure remaining today is the Taq Kasra, sometimes called the Archway of Ctesiphon.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-ctesiphon-destroyed>How was Ctesiphon destroyed?</h2>
<p>The infantry was probably also sent on the eastern shore of the Tigris with boats moored on the shore. The Sassanian forces were too inferior to offer effective resistance to Muslims, and so Ctesiphon fell. Led by Asim ibn ‘Amr, Muslim forces entered the Sassanian capital.</p>

<h2 id=is-baghdad-a-ctesiphon>Is Baghdad a Ctesiphon?</h2>
<p>Ctesiphon is located approximately at Al-Mada’in, 32 km (20 mi) southeast of the modern city of Baghdad, Iraq, along the river Tigris. Ctesiphon measured 30 square kilometers, more than twice the surface of 13.7-square-kilometer fourth-century imperial Rome.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-ancient-city-of-ctesiphon-located>Where was the ancient city of Ctesiphon located?</h2>
<p>The ruins of Ctesiphon are presently in a state of slow deterioration in the village of Salman Pak, Iraq, a suburb of Baghdad. The city was known as Tisfun to the Persians, Ktesiphon to the Greeks, and is best known by its Latin designation, Ctesiphon; the meaning of the name is unknown.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-parthian-empire-in-ctesiphon>Who was the leader of the Parthian Empire in Ctesiphon?</h2>
<p>Ctesiphon was more or less deserted afterwards and, as the Parthian Empire was crumbling, no effort was made to rebuild or repopulate the city. Ardashir I had been a general in the Parthian army who led the revolt which toppled the empire.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-ctesiphon-an-important-center-of-nestorianism>Why was Ctesiphon an important center of Nestorianism?</h2>
<p>In the fifth century, Ctesiphon became a very important center of Nestorianism, a Christian church that disagrees with the western churches about the nature of Christ. Missionaries from Ctesiphon christianized many people along the Silk Road, e.g., at Rhagae and Maracanda, and in Margiana and Aria.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-romans-want-to-capture-ctesiphon>Why did the Romans want to capture Ctesiphon?</h2>
<p>Ctesiphon measured 30 square kilometers (cf. the 13.7 square kilometers of imperial Rome). In the second century CE, the large city became the natural target for Roman aggression, because the Romans thought that the capture of the Parthian capital would inevitably result in the fall of the rival empire.</p>
