<h2 id=what-did-lewis-and-clark-study>What did Lewis and Clark study?</h2>
<p>Lewis knew that exploring the Louisiana Territory would be no small task and began preparations immediately. He studied medicine, botany, astronomy and zoology and scrutinized existing maps and journals of the region. He also asked his friend Clark to co-command the expedition.</p>
<h2 id=what-area-was-explored-by-lewis-and-clark>What area was explored by Lewis and Clark?</h2>
<p>Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–06) was a U.S. military expedition, led by Captain Meriwether Lewis and Lieutenant William Clark, to explore the Louisiana Purchase and the Pacific Northwest. The expedition was a major chapter in the history of American exploration.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-lewis-go-for-scientific-training-before-the-expedition>Where did Lewis go for scientific training before the expedition?</h2>
<p>In the spring of 1803, Lewis traveled to Philadelphia to study with the leading scientists of the day. Andrew Ellicott taught Lewis map making and surveying. Benjamin Smith Barton tutored Lewis in botany, Robert Patterson in mathematics, Caspar Wistar in anatomy and fossils, and Benjamin Rush in medicine.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-lewis-and-clark-recruit-for-their-expedition>Where did Lewis and Clark recruit for their expedition?</h2>
<p>The Expedition Begins. Lewis entrusted Clark to recruit men for their “Corps of Volunteers for Northwest Discovery.” Throughout the winter of 1803-1804, Clark recruited and trained men at Camp DuBois north of St. Louis, Missouri. He chose unmarried, healthy men who were good hunters and knew survival skills.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-students-do-for-lewis-and-clark-study>What should students do for Lewis and Clark study?</h2>
<p>Have students properly identify the specimen by name (Latin and common) and have them measure the plants. Lead a discussion on what students think were the major contributions of the Lewis & Clark Expedition. Have students create a newspaper on their experiences as members of the Expedition. Don’t forget to include artwork.</p>

<h2 id=what-did-lewis-and-clark-learn-from-robert-patterson>What did Lewis and Clark learn from Robert Patterson?</h2>
<p>From Benjamin Smith Barton, Lewis learned how to describe and preserve plant and animal specimens, from Robert Patterson refinements in computing latitude and longitude, while Caspar Wistar covered fossils, and the search for possible living remnants.</p>
