<h2 id=can-i-grow-butternut-squash-from-the-seeds-inside>Can I grow butternut squash from the seeds inside?</h2>
<p>Sowing butternut squash seed Butternut squash is easy to grow from seed. Start indoors in early April by sowing two seeds per pot. Thin to one seedling and harden off outdoors after the last frosts before planting out in late May into well prepared beds.</p>
<h2 id=where-should-you-not-plant-squash>Where should you not plant squash?</h2>
<p>Squash should also no be planted near potatoes. Potatoes can have an growth inhibiting affect on other crops and it is a very heavy feeder which would compete for soil nutrients. Potatoes, Onions and other root crops can also disturb the shallow roots of squash plants, which can make them less strong and healthy.</p>
<h2 id=what-month-do-you-plant-squash>What month do you plant squash?</h2>
<p>Plant squash in spring when temperatures are regularly in the 70s. For a head start and faster harvest, use young plants from Bonnie Plants®.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-i-plant-next-to-butternut-squash>What can I plant next to butternut squash?</h2>
<p>There are several other plants that can be used as companion plants for squash; radishes, cucumbers, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and cabbage. Each other these will either benefit from growing near squash or benefit the squash.</p>
<h2 id=should-squash-seeds-be-soaked-before-planting>Should squash seeds be soaked before planting?</h2>
<p>Squash seeds, like all seeds, need moisture to soften and break the seed coat so the seedling can emerge. Many gardeners soak squash seeds for an hour or two before planting. Soils must stay evenly moist, but not soggy, until the seedlings break through the soil surface.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-plant-next-to-squash>What do you plant next to squash?</h2>
<p>“Good neighbors” plants for squash include radishes, corn, peas, beans, pumpkin, marigolds, and nasturtiums. Corn, squash and cucumbers, and peas or beans planted together is a tradition established by Native Americans, who planted these three crops together in a raised mound.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-not-plant-next-to-winter-squash>What can you not plant next to winter squash?</h2>
<p>Avoid planting root crops, such as beets, onions, and potatoes, near squash, which may disturb sensitive squash roots when harvested.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-not-plant-near-butternut-squash>What can you not plant near Butternut squash?</h2>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-grow-squash-indoors-in-a-pot>Is it possible to grow squash indoors in a pot?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can, and it’s relatively easy as long as you provide the proper growing conditions, primarily a large pot and plenty of sunlight. Sound like fun? Let’s learn about growing squash indoors. Although vining squash needs a large growing space, smaller bush-type squash plants are suitable for growing indoors.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-a-squash-plant-to-grow>How long does it take for a squash plant to grow?</h2>
<p>They may be smaller, but indoor squash plants can produce a hefty harvest beginning about sixty days after planting. Some popular available in compact bush varieties include: Bush squash doesn’t require a huge growing space like standard vining squash, but it’s still a relatively large plant.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-squash-plant-grow-both-male-and-female>Can a squash plant grow both male and female?</h2>
<p>Squash is self-fertile ( male and female blooms are found on the same plant). However, unless you have bees or other pollinators indoors, you may need to help out with pollination. One easy way to accomplish this is to pick an open male flower (one with a longer stem and no swelling at the base of the bloom).</p>
<h2 id=is-it-better-to-grow-vegetables-indoors-or-outside>Is it better to grow vegetables indoors or outside?</h2>
<p>Growing vegetables indoors is ideal for people who live in the city or those who don’t have a decent gardening spot in the yard. You will find that growing vegetables in pots is more straightforward than you thought.</p>
