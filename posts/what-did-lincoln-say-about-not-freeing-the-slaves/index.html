<h2 id=what-did-lincoln-say-about-not-freeing-the-slaves>What did Lincoln say about not freeing the slaves?</h2>
<p>In August 1862, Lincoln stated: “If I could save the union without freeing any slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that.” In fact, by that time, immense pressure was building to end slavery …</p>
<h2 id=why-could-lincoln-only-free-the-slaves-in-the-states-that-were-in-rebellion-and-not-all-of-the-slaves-throughout-the-country>Why could Lincoln only free the slaves in the states that were in rebellion and not all of the slaves throughout the country?</h2>
<p>Why could Lincoln only free the slaves in the states that were in rebellion and not all of the slaves throughout the country? The president did not have the power to end slavery within the United States; this would have been a matter of changing the Constitution, which cannot be done by the president alone.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-lincoln-delay-freeing-the-slaves>Why did Lincoln delay freeing the slaves?</h2>
<p>On July 22, 1862, Lincoln presented a proclamation to his Cabinet, calling for the gradual abolition of slavery. In the midst of a summer of Union battle losses, Lincoln decided to postpone issuing this document until he could speak from a position of strength following a significant military victory.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-lincolns-decision-about-freeing-the-slaves-in-the-border-states>What was Lincoln’s decision about freeing the slaves in the border states?</h2>
<p>President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, as the nation approached its third year of bloody civil war. The proclamation declared “that all persons held as slaves” within the rebellious states “are, and henceforward shall be free.”</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-slaves-in-these-states>What happens to the slaves in these states?</h2>
<p>In the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln does not mention Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri. These states had slaves but were not part of the Confederacy (they were not fighting against the Union). What happens to the slaves in these states? The Union would gain people and the Confederacy would lose people.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-another-name-for-juneteenth>What is another name for Juneteenth?</h2>
<p>Emancipation Day<br>
Juneteenth, official name of federal holiday Juneteenth National Independence Day, also called Emancipation Day, Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, Black Independence Day, and Juneteenth Independence Day, holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States, observed annually on June 19.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-president-lincoln-say-about-freeing-slaves>What did President Lincoln say about freeing slaves?</h2>
<p>It read in part: “That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; . . .</p>
<h2 id=what-did-lincoln-do-with-the-emancipation-proclamation>What did Lincoln do with the Emancipation Proclamation?</h2>
<p>5. The Emancipation Proclamation didn’t actually free all of the slaves. Since Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation as a military measure, it didn’t apply to border slave states like Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, all of which were loyal to the Union.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-difference-between-lincolns-proclamation-and-confiscation-acts>What was the difference between Lincoln’s Proclamation and Confiscation Acts?</h2>
<p>Whereas the Confiscation Acts freed the slaves of individual owners who demonstrated disloyalty, Lincoln’s proclamation freed slaves of all owners residing in geographic areas engaged in rebellion as “a fit and necessary military measure.” The reaction of Lincoln’s cabinet members was mixed.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-declaration-of-independence-say-about-slavery>What did the declaration of Independence say about slavery?</h2>
<p>“Order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States, and parts of States, are, and henceforward shall be free; and that the Executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authorities thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons.”</p>
