<h2 id=how-long-did-germany-occupy-warsaw>How long did Germany occupy Warsaw?</h2>
<p>On October 1 the Wehrmacht entered Warsaw, which started a period of German occupation that lasted until the devastating Warsaw Uprising and later until January 17, 1945, when the Wehrmacht troops abandoned the city due to the advance of Soviet forces. Around 18,000 civilians of Warsaw perished during the siege.</p>

<p>German and Soviet soldiers stroll around Sambir after the German-Soviet invasion of Poland. By the end of the invasion the Soviet Union had taken over 51.6% of the territory of Poland (about 201,000 square kilometres (78,000 sq mi)), with over 13,200,000 people.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-occupation-of-poland-in-world-war-2>What was the occupation of Poland in World War 2?</h2>
<p>Occupation of Poland (1939–1945) The occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II (1939–1945) began with the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, and it was formally concluded with the defeat of Germany by the Allies in May 1945.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-germany-lose-in-the-war-with-poland>What did Germany lose in the war with Poland?</h2>
<p>Germany lost land to Poland and France. The French received Alsace-Lorraine, lost decades before during the Franco-Prussian War of 1871. The “Polish Corridor,” a strip of land given to Poland granting it access to the Baltic Sea, meant East Prussia was now physically separate from the rest of the country.</p>
