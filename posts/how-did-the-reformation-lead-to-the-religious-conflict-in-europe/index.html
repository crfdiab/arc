<h2 id=how-did-the-reformation-lead-to-the-religious-conflict-in-europe>How did the Reformation lead to the religious conflict in Europe?</h2>
<p>How did the Reformation lead to religious conflict in Europe? Reject Martin Luther’s demand. It was a lot of wars between the Catholic’s and Protestant forces. Europe’s religious and economic conflicts were not settled by the defeat of the Armada.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-reformation-lead-to-religious-wars>Why did the Reformation lead to religious wars?</h2>
<p>They argued for a religious and political redistribution of power into the hands of Bible- and pamphlet-reading pastors and princes. The disruption triggered wars, persecutions and the so-called Counter-Reformation, the Catholic Church’s delayed but forceful response to the Protestants.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-consequences-of-the-reformation-in-europe>What were the consequences of the Reformation in Europe?</h2>
<p>The literature on the consequences of the Reformation shows a variety of short- and long-run effects, including Protestant-Catholic differences in human capital, economic development, competition in media markets, political economy, and anti-Semitism, among others.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-and-effects-of-the-reformation>What are the causes and effects of the Reformation?</h2>
<p>The corruption in the church with the political and economic power of the church and brought resentment with all classes especially the noble class. People made impressions that church leaders had cared more about gaining wealth than ministering the followers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-reformation-affect-the-economy>How did the Reformation affect the economy?</h2>
<p>While Protestant reformers aimed to elevate the role of religion, we find that the Reformation produced rapid economic secularization. This transfer of resources shifted the demand for labor between religious and secular sectors: graduates from Protestant universities increasingly entered secular occupations.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-protestant-faith>What was the first protestant faith?</h2>
<p>lutheranism was the first protestant faith. lutheranism taught salvation through faith alone, not good works.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-protestant-reformation>What was the impact of the Protestant Reformation?</h2>
<p>The Protestant Reformation was the 16th-century religious, political, intellectual and cultural upheaval that splintered Catholic Europe, setting in place the structures and beliefs that would define the continent in the modern era.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-protestant-reformation>Who was the leader of the Protestant Reformation?</h2>
<p>In northern and central Europe, reformers like Martin Luther, John Calvin and Henry VIII challenged papal authority and questioned the Catholic Church’s ability to define Christian practice. They argued for a religious and political redistribution of power into the hands of Bible- and pamphlet-reading pastors and princes.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-confessional-cause-the-protestant-reformation>Why did the confessional cause the Protestant Reformation?</h2>
<p>The confessional explanation is particularly true of the Holy Roman Empire throughout the period. The multiplicity of small, weak states abiding by the newly established principle of “Cuius regio, eius religio” (by his Rule, by his Religion) led to many Religious borders and boundaries forming.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-protestants-revolt-against-the-catholic-church>Why did Protestants revolt against the Catholic Church?</h2>
<p>In this conflict, German Protestants rebelled against the very catholic Holy Roman Empire in order to gain political and economic freedom. As the name implies, a majority of them were from the lower classes of society. Sadly, for the rebels, the revolt ended in failure, leaving thousands of peasants dead.</p>
