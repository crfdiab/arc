<h2 id=what-was-the-reason-for-the-death-of-marie-antoinette>What was the reason for the death of Marie Antoinette?</h2>
<p>The Death Of Marie Antoinette In January 1793, King Louis XVI was sentenced to death for conspiring against the state. He was allowed to spend a few short hours with his family until his execution before a crowd of 20,000. Marie Antoinette, meanwhile, was still in limbo.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-that-marie-antoinette-married>Who was the king that Marie Antoinette married?</h2>
<p>Nine months after the execution of her husband, the former King Louis XVI of France, Marie-Antoinette follows him to the guillotine. The daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Francis I, she married Louis in 1770 to strengthen the French-Austrian alliance.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-marie-antoinette-when-she-was-put-on-trial>Where was Marie Antoinette when she was put on trial?</h2>
<p>Marie Antoinette, meanwhile, was still in limbo. In early August she was transferred from the Temple to the Conciergerie, known as “the antechamber to the guillotine,” and two months later she was put on trial. Wikimedia Commons The final palace of Marie Antoinette was the Conciergerie prison in Paris.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-marie-antoinettes-hair-go-white-overnight>Why did Marie Antoinette’s hair go white overnight?</h2>
<p>The days preceding Marie Antoinette’s execution were excruciating. She was imprisoned, endured allegations of incest, and her hair went white overnight from shock. Marie Antoinette: the very name of the doomed queen of France, the last of the Ancien Régime, evokes power and fascination.</p>

<h2 id=where-are-louis-xvi-and-marie-antoinette-buried>Where are Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette buried?</h2>
<p>Viewed 2k times. 6. I have read that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were both buried in unmarked graves after their executions during the French Revolution. On January 18, 1815, during the Bourbon Restoration, their bodies were exhumed and moved to their current location in the necropolis of French kings at the Basilica of St. Denis.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-house-did-marie-antoinette-live-in>What kind of House did Marie Antoinette live in?</h2>
<p>When Louis officially became king, he gave Marie Antoinette Petit Trianon, a three-story “pleasure house” tucked away in the vast grounds of Versailles. The house had been under construction from 1762-68 — it was intended for Madame de Pompadour, a mistress of Louis XV.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-marie-antoinettes-best-friend>What was the name of Marie Antoinette’s best friend?</h2>
<p>One of Marie Antoinette’s best friends, the Princesse de Lamballe, was dismembered in the street, and revolutionaries paraded her head and body parts through Paris. In December, Louis XVI was put on trial for treason; in January, he was executed.</p>
