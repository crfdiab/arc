<h2 id=what-is-the-advantage-of-a-space-telescope-over-a-ground-based-telescope>What is the advantage of a space telescope over a ground-based telescope?</h2>
<p>Space-based telescopes like Hubble get a much clearer view of the universe than most of their ground-based counterparts. They’re also able to detect frequencies and wavelengths across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-of-an-orbiting-telescope-over-an-earth-based-one>What are the advantages of an orbiting telescope over an earth based one?</h2>
<p>Space telescopes have the advantage of being above the blurring effects of the Earth’s atmosphere. In addition, there are many wavelengths from the electromagnetic spectrum that do not reach Earth because they are absorbed or reflected by the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=why-being-in-space-gives-hubble-an-advantage-over-telescopes-based-on-earth>Why being in space gives Hubble an advantage over telescopes based on Earth?</h2>
<p>Earth’s atmosphere changes and blocks some of the light that comes from space. Hubble flies around, or orbits, high above Earth and its atmosphere. So, Hubble can see space better than telescopes on Earth can.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-a-ground-based-telescope>What are the disadvantages of a ground-based telescope?</h2>
<p>Despite the convenience of ground telescopes, they do feature a few drawbacks that space telescopes don’t have.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower Cost. Ground-based telescopes cost about 10 to 20 times less than a comparable space telescope.</li>
<li>Maintenance Issues.</li>
<li>Site Requirements.</li>
<li>Image Quality.</li>
<li>Deficient Data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-far-can-a-ground-telescope-see>How far can a ground telescope see?</h2>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope can see out to a distance of several billions of light-years. A light-year is the distance that light travels in 1 year.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-hubble-space-telescope-so-important>Why is the Hubble Space Telescope so important?</h2>
<p>Hubble’s orbit outside the distortion of Earth’s atmosphere allows it to take extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-space-based-telescopes-better-than-ground-based-telescopes>Why are space based telescopes better than ground based telescopes?</h2>
<p>They’re also able to detect frequencies and wavelengths across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Ground-based telescopes can’t do the same, because the Earth’s atmosphere absorbs a lot of the infrared and ultraviolet light that passes through it. Nevertheless, space-based telescopes are expensive to build and difficult to maintain.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-using-a-space-telescope>What are the disadvantages of using a Space Telescope?</h2>
<p>In space, however, telescopes are able to get a clearer shot of everything from exploding stars to other galaxies. Another disadvantage for ground-based telescopes is that the Earth’s atmosphere absorbs much of the infrared and ultraviolet light that passes through it. Space telescopes can detect these waves.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-first-telescope-to-be-repaired-by-astronauts>Which is the first telescope to be repaired by astronauts?</h2>
<p>NASA’s Hubble, with infrared eyes built by the University of Arizona, is the first space telescope designed to be repaired by astronauts in space. Other space telescopes cannot be serviced this way. But as technology advances, both telescopes on the ground and in space are continuing to improve.</p>
