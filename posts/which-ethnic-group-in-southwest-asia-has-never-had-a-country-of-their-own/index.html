<h2 id=which-ethnic-group-in-southwest-asia-has-never-had-a-country-of-their-own>Which ethnic group in southwest Asia has never had a country of their own?</h2>
<p>Between 25 and 35 million Kurds inhabit a mountainous region straddling the borders of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia. They make up the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East, but they have never obtained a permanent nation state.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-region-that-includes-land-from-the-persian-gulf-through-the-tigris>What is the name of the region that includes land from the Persian Gulf through the Tigris?</h2>
<p>The Fertile Crescent is bounded on the west by the Mediterranean Sea and on the East by the Persian Gulf. The Tigris and Euphrates rivers flow through the heart of the Fertile Crescent. The region historically contained unusually fertile soil and productive freshwater and brackish wetlands.</p>
<h2 id=who-developed-what-became-known-as-the-golden-age-of-persian-culture>Who developed what became known as the Golden Age of Persian culture?</h2>
<p>Cyrus the Great—the leader of one such tribe—began to defeat nearby kingdoms, including Media, Lydia and Babylon, joining them under one rule. He founded the first Persian Empire, also known as the Achaemenid Empire, in 550 B.C.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-great-game-quizlet>What was the great game quizlet?</h2>
<p>For much of the 19th century, Great Britain and Russia engaged in yet another geopolitical struggle, this time over Muslim lands in Central Asia. Known as the “Great Game,” the war was waged over India, one of Britain’s most profitable colonies. Russia sought to extend its empire and gain access to India’s riches.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-great-game-quizlet>What was the cause of the Great Game quizlet?</h2>
<p>What was the cause of the Great Game? in the 19th century both Great Britain and The Russian were struggling for control of their region. The Russian troops had moved southward and british leaders wanted to stop the advance before the troops could threaten Britain’s possesions in india.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-great-game->What was the cause of the Great Game *?</h2>
<p>The Great Game is said to have begun on 12 January 1830 when Lord Ellenborough, the president of the Board of Control for India tasked Lord William Bentinck, the Governor-General of India, to establish a new trade route to Bukhara.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-afghanistan-become-part-of-persian-empire>When did Afghanistan become part of Persian Empire?</h2>
<p>We first get a clear glimpse into Afghanistan’s history around 500 BCE, when it formed the eastern part of the Achaemenid Persian empire. Parts of Afghanistan were previously part of the ancient Indian kingdom of Gandhara, a region in what is now northwest Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-mughal-empire-try-to-control-afghanistan>How did the Mughal Empire try to control Afghanistan?</h2>
<p>The closest most historical empires have come to controlling Afghanistan was by adopting a light-handed approach, as the Mughals did. They managed to loosely control the area by paying off various tribes, or granting them autonomy. Attempts at anything resembling centralized control, even by native Afghan governments, have largely failed.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-first-anglo-afghan-war>Who was involved in the First Anglo-Afghan War?</h2>
<p>First Anglo-Afghan War. The First Anglo-Afghan War (also known as Disaster in Afghanistan) was fought between the British East India Company and the Emirate of Afghanistan from 1839 to 1842. The war is notorious for the loss of 4,500 British and Indian soldiers, plus 12,000 of their camp followers to Afghan tribal fighters.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-ruler-of-afghanistan-after-the-kushans>Who was the ruler of Afghanistan after the Kushans?</h2>
<p>After the Kushan Empire’s rule was ended by Sassanids, much of modern-day Afghanistan was part of the Persian Sasanian Empire, since Shapur I extended his authority eastwards into Afghanistan and the previously autonomous Kushans were obliged to accept his suzerainty.</p>
