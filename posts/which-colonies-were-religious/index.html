<h2 id=which-colonies-were-religious>Which colonies were religious?</h2>
<p>The New England colonies, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland were conceived and established “as plantations of religion.” Some settlers who arrived in these areas came for secular motives–“to catch fish” as one New Englander put it–but the great majority left Europe to worship God in the way they believed to be …</p>
<h2 id=what-dominated-life-in-the-new-england-colonies>What dominated life in the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>the Puritans<br>
The New England colonies were dominated by the Puritans, reformers seeking to “purify” Christianity, who came over from England to practice religion without persecution. Puritans followed strict rules and were intolerant of other religions, eventually absorbing the separatist Pilgrims in Massachusetts by 1629.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-of-the-american-colonies>What was the religion of the American colonies?</h2>
<p>This is very ironic as most of the colonies in America were creating laws and restrictions that enforced people to only practice certain religions. The main religion that quickly took control in the colonies was Christianity. In the colonies, the practice of religion was also different from previous ideas.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-religious-toleration-start-in-the-colonies>When did religious toleration start in the colonies?</h2>
<p>Mid-Atlantic and Southern Colonies. The Catholic leadership passed a law of religious toleration in 1649, only to see it repealed it when Puritans took over the colony’s assembly. Clergy and buildings belonging to both the Catholic and Puritan religions were subsidized by a general tax. Quakers founded Pennsylvania.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-religion-influence-slavery-in-colonial-america>How did religion influence slavery in colonial America?</h2>
<p>Slavery—which was also firmly established and institutionalized between the 1680s and the 1780s—was also shaped by religion.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-people-go-to-church-in-colonial-america>Where did people go to church in colonial America?</h2>
<p>The meetinghouse, which served secular functions as well as religious, was a small wood building located in the center of town. People sat on hard wooden benches for most of the day, which was how long the church services usually lasted.</p>
