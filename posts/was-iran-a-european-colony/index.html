<h2 id=was-iran-a-european-colony>Was Iran a European colony?</h2>
<p>Iran was never colonized by European powers, but this did not protect it from the colonial reach of the United Kingdom. In the late nineteenth century, the British-India Company had established a monopoly over tobacco trade in Iran, at the expense of the local merchant class.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-british-colonize-iran>Did the British colonize Iran?</h2>
<p>While the UK never colonized Iran, they did shape the modern Iranian state during the so-called “Great Game” between the British Empire and the Russian Empire in the Middle East. In the 19th Century the pair fought a war over control of Herat, now in Afghanistan. The British army won.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-iran-colonize>Who did Iran colonize?</h2>
<p>Iran has been colonized by the Greeks (Alexander and Seleucid), by Arabs (Umayyad and early Abbasid caliphate), by the Turks (Seljuks and onward), by the Mongols (Genghis all the way up to Timur), by the Russians in the 18th century and the British in the 19th/20th century.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-eu-currently-have-sanctions-on-iran>Does the EU currently have sanctions on Iran?</h2>
<p>Non-UN-mandated sanctions against Iran. The European Union has imposed restrictions on cooperation with Iran in foreign trade, financial services, energy sectors and technologies, and banned the provision of insurance and reinsurance by insurers in member states to Iran and Iranian-owned companies.</p>
<h2 id=what-side-was-iran-on-in-world-war-2>What side was Iran on in World War 2?</h2>
<p>Reza Shah declared Iran neutral at the start of World War II.</p>
<h2 id=which-countries-still-trade-with-iran>Which countries still trade with Iran?</h2>
<p>The most common import partners for Iran are China ($9.61B), United Arab Emirates ($7.08B), India ($3.86B), Turkey ($2.6B), and Brazil ($2.19B).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-oldest-country-of-all-time>What is the oldest country of all time?</h2>
<p>Japan is the oldest country in the world. The Japanese Emperor who ascended the throne in 660 BCE was apparently the descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu. Which country has the longest history in the world? China has the longest history in the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-united-states-interested-in-iran>Why is the United States interested in Iran?</h2>
<p>While the United States remains connected to world markets, the country is far less dependent on foreign sources of oil than in the past. For natural gas U.S. marketed production now exceeds U.S. consumption. The United States has become an exporter of natural gas.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-europeans-want-to-come-to-africa>Why did the Europeans want to come to Africa?</h2>
<p>Europeans were interested in Africa because of the abundance of raw materials for industries, minerals, cheap labor and to expand their territories. Some of the countries that were especially interested in Africa include Britain, France and Portugal.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-relationship-does-russia-have-with-iran>What kind of relationship does Russia have with Iran?</h2>
<p>Iran and Russia are strategic allies and form an axis in the Caucasus alongside Armenia. Iran and Russia are also military allies in the conflicts in Syria and Iraq and partners in Afghanistan and post- Soviet Central Asia. Due to Western economic sanctions on Iran, Russia has become a key trading partner, especially in regard to …</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-us-interested-in-the-iran-pipeline>Why is the US interested in the Iran pipeline?</h2>
<p>The pipeline was originally planned to bring natural gas to India as well before that country pulled out of the project. The U.S. government clearly wants to prevent Iran from using its energy exports to give it leverage with other countries.</p>
