<h2 id=can-a-convicted-felon-own-a-crossbow-in-washington-state>Can a convicted felon own a crossbow in Washington state?</h2>
<p>Due to the strict laws on felons and firearm ownership, one might assume that a convicted felon would also be prohibited from owning a crossbow. However, since crossbows don’t fall under the firearm umbrella, they are federally legal for felons to possess after leaving prison.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-felon-own-a-air-rifle-in-washington-state>Can a felon own a air rifle in Washington state?</h2>
<p>A. Both Washington state and federal law prohibit felons from possessing firearms.</p>
<h2 id=what-weapon-can-a-felon-own>What weapon can a felon own?</h2>
<p>Convicted felons may possess daggers, dirks or stillettos in his or her residence, but may not carry them in cars or in public. The other weapons cannot be owned. Additionally, in a separate charge, felons are not permitted to own body armor if their felonies were related to an act of violence.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-felon-own-a-gun-after-10-years-in-washington-state>Can a felon own a gun after 10 years in Washington State?</h2>
<p>In Washington State, anyone who has been convicted of a felony or any crime of domestic violence is ineligible to possess a firearm. This ban will last a lifetime, unless the right is restored by a court of record (typically the Superior Court where the individual resides).</p>
<h2 id=can-a-felon-buy-a-80-lower>Can a felon buy a 80 lower?</h2>
<p>Convicted felons are not restricted from purchasing and owning 80% frames as they are not firearms, however, it is prohibited by Federal law that a felon ever build or own a firearm. Therefore felons completing Polymer80 frames into firearms is illegal.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-a-felon-gets-caught-with-a-gun-in-washington-state>What happens if a felon gets caught with a gun in Washington state?</h2>
<p>Any individual who has been convicted of a felony and caught with a firearm in their possession can be arrested and charged with unlawful firearm possession. A felony is a criminal offense that results in a prison term of one year or more.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-convicted-felon-hunt-with-a-bow>Can a convicted felon hunt with a bow?</h2>
<p>However, just because it is not a firearm and a felon will not be convicted for breaking the 1968 Gun Control Act, it is important for those considering this to check state laws and regulations before purchasing one specifically for hunting.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-felon-own-a-crossbow-in-washington-state>Can a felon own a crossbow in Washington State?</h2>
<p>Some states ban crossbow hunting regardless of a person’s criminal background, such as Oregon. On the other hand, Texas has certain restrictions in certain counties, so you not only have to know the state law but also the local county laws. Meanwhile, Washington State actually holds “lotteries” for hunting privileges for felons.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-felon-own-a-gun-after-a-felony>Can a felon own a gun after a felony?</h2>
<p>After doing time, most felons return to their hobbies. For some, hunting – bow hunting, specifically. However, the law restrains felons from owning firearms after a felony conviction. This applies to all felons – whether they committed a firearm-related crime or not.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-hunt-with-a-bow-in-wisconsin>Is it legal to hunt with a bow in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>In Wisconsin, it is legal to hunt with a bow as long as you have not had your hunting privileges revoked and the individual has an appropriate permit for archery season. It is also possible to hunt during the gun (deer) season with a crossbow, but it is strongly advised that you consult legal aid before actioning this advice.</p>
