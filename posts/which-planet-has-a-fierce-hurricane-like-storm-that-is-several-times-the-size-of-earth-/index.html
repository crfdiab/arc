<h2 id=which-planet-has-a-fierce-hurricane-like-storm-that-is-several-times-the-size-of-earth->Which planet has a fierce hurricane like storm that is several times the size of Earth *?</h2>
<p>The planet with a hurricane-like storm several times the size of Earth is Jupiter.</p>
<h2 id=which-planet-has-more-storm>Which planet has more storm?</h2>
<p>Saturn’s lightning: 10,000 times more powerful than Earth’s Saturn occasionally develops massive storms that extend more than 190,000 miles (300,000 kilometers), encircling almost the entire planet, while the gas giant’s north pole plays host to a weird, permanent hexagon of clouds that extends deep into the planet.</p>
<h2 id=what-position-is-earth-in-the-solar-system>What position is Earth in the solar system?</h2>
<p>Earth is the third planet from the sun and orbits at an average distance of 93 million miles, meaning that it takes sunlight about eight minutes to arrive. As you move outward from the sun, the planets are spaced increasingly farther apart.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-strongest-hurricane-in-the-western-hemisphere>Which is the strongest hurricane in the Western Hemisphere?</h2>
<p>If you’ve been anywhere near a computer, tv, or newspaper in the last week, you’ve likely heard it mentioned that the East Pacific ‘s Hurricane Patricia is now the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere. But if Patricia is that fierce of a storm,…</p>
<h2 id=how-are-hurricanes-known-in-other-parts-of-the-world>How are hurricanes known in other parts of the world?</h2>
<p>In other parts of the world, hurricanes are known by different names. In the western Pacific and China Sea area, hurricanes are known as typhoons, from the Cantonese tai-fung, meaning great wind. In Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, and Australia, they are known as cyclones, and finally, in the Philippines, they are known as bagyo.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-famous-storm-in-the-solar-system>Which is the most famous storm in the Solar System?</h2>
<p>“Juno data indicate that the solar system’s most famous storm is almost one-and-a-half Earths wide, and has roots that penetrate about 200 miles (300 kilometers) into the planet’s atmosphere,” said Scott Bolton, Juno’s principal investigator.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-most-devastating-hurricane>What was the name of the most devastating hurricane?</h2>
<p>Hurricane Andrew (1992), the most devastating hurricane of this century, was a relatively small hurricane. Do not focus on the location and track of the center, because the hurricane’s destructive winds and rains cover a wide swath.</p>
