<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-there-is-no-rainfall>What is it called when there is no rainfall?</h2>
<p>A drought is a period of drier-than-normal conditions that results in water-related problems. Precipitation (rain or snow) falls in uneven patterns across the country. When little or no rain falls, soils can dry out and plants can die.</p>
<h2 id=why-there-is-no-rainfall-in-qatar-and-saudi-arabia>Why there is no rainfall in Qatar and Saudi Arabia?</h2>
<p>Why there is no rainfall in Qatar and Saudi Arabia? The descending air suppresses rainfall, ensuring that even if there is hot, humid air near the surface, which would normally be perfect for the formation of showers, the descending dry air high in the atmosphere inhibits any from forming.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-there-was-no-rain-in-the-world>What happens if there was no rain in the world?</h2>
<p>If There Were No Rain Water is essential for man’s survival. One can do without food for a few weeks but cannot do without water for more than four days. If it suddenly happens to come that it stops raining, there would be ominous casualties.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-rain-not-fall-when-there-is-a-drought>Why does rain not fall when there is a drought?</h2>

<h2 id=why-does-it-never-rain-in-the-state-of-california>Why does it never rain in the state of California?</h2>
<p>Namely, most of the state does have a Mediterranean climate, which is characterized by hot and dry summers. There is the desert area which also makes us think that rain is not that common in California. Did you know that Death Valley, the place with the highest recorded temperatures in the world, is located in California?</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-less-rain-in-the-summer>Why is there less rain in the summer?</h2>
<p>When there is little wind, spray from waves is not prevalent and so less evaporation of spray occurs, which can cause lower rainfall. Rob Hooft, Manager, Scientist, Programmer. You’re out of the water cycle. Water comes into the atmosphere through evaporation. If the air cools down (e.g.</p>
