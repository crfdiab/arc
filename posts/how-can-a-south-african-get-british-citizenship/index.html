<h2 id=how-can-a-south-african-get-british-citizenship>How can a South African get British citizenship?</h2>
<p>You could be eligible for British citizenship if you were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Born to a parent (a father or mother) who was born in the UK before 1983.</li>
<li>Born after 1948 to a parent born in Southern Rhodesia before 12.09.</li>
<li>Born in Northern Rhodesia before independence with a UK-born grandparent.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-do-you-get-uk-citizenship>How do you get UK Citizenship?</h2>

<ol>
<li>are 18 or over.</li>
<li>are married to, or in a civil partnership with, someone who is a British citizen.</li>

</ol>
<h2 id=when-did-uk-stop-citizenship-by-birth>When did UK stop Citizenship by birth?</h2>
<p>1 January 1983<br>
Children born before 1983 You are automatically a British citizen if you were born in the UK before 1 January 1983, unless your father was a diplomat working for a non-UK country or if you were born in the Channel Islands during World War 2.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-need-a-visa-from-south-africa-to-uk>Do I need a visa from South Africa to UK?</h2>
<p>And yes, if you’re travelling on a South African passport you’ll need a visa to enter the UK. Once in, there are no border controls between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Island, which makes it a joy to travel around the UK, as only a single UK visa is required. The UK comprises 3 full-on countries.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-uk-citizenship>How long does it take to get a UK citizenship?</h2>
<p>How long does it take to get British Citizenship? Applications for Naturalisation as a British Citizen can take up to 6 months to be determined. However, we typically receive UK Citizenship decisions from the Home Office within about 3 months.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-child-born-before-1983-become-a-british-citizen>Can a child born before 1983 become a British citizen?</h2>
<p>Children born before 1983 are automatically UK citizens if the father is British or a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, other than married to their mother. You can register for citizenship by descent either online or submitting a paper application on Form MN1. The application can be made from both within the UK or abroad.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-be-born-in-south-africa-to-get-citizenship>Do you have to be born in South Africa to get citizenship?</h2>
<p>you are born in South Africa and at least one of your parents is a South African citizen or a SA permanent residency permit holder if you are adopted by a South African citizen. You can apply for South African citizenship by descent or naturalisation. You can also apply to retain your citizenship before you obtain…</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-be-born-in-the-uk-to-get-british-citizenship>Do you have to be born in the UK to get British citizenship?</h2>
<p>You do not automatically get British citizenship if you were born in the UK. It depends on when you were born and your parents’ circumstances. You may be eligible to apply for citizenship if you were born in the UK and are not a British citizen. You may be able to apply for citizenship by ‘naturalisation’, depending on your situation.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-only-way-to-become-a-british-citizen-before-1970>What was the only way to become a British citizen before 1970?</h2>
<p>From 1970 they tend only to include the full name of the applicant, their date and place of birth. Before 1844 the only way to naturalise was through a private Act of Parliament. Often a single act, usually appearing on parchment rolls, covered multiple individuals and contained nothing more than their names and professions.</p>
