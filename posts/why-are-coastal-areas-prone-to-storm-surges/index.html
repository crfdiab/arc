<h2 id=why-are-coastal-areas-prone-to-storm-surges>Why are coastal areas prone to storm surges?</h2>
<p>As the tropical cyclone approaches the coast, strong winds push the ocean water over the low-lying coastal areas, which can lead to flooding. This makes storm surges very dangerous. Storm surge becomes more dangerous when it arrives on top of a high tide.</p>
<h2 id=which-coastal-areas-are-most-vulnerable-to-storm-surge>Which coastal areas are most vulnerable to storm surge?</h2>
<p>The shape of the coastline makes a difference. Places with bays are especially vulnerable because the mound of water can get funneled into a small area. Storm surge risk is higher in Tampa Bay, Florida, than along the coast to the west on the Gulf of Mexico because storm surge water gets funneled into the bay.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-storms-in-gulf-of-mexico>What causes storms in Gulf of Mexico?</h2>
<p>During the winter, the Gulf of Mexico will provide warmth and moisture to Coastal Mississippi. The warm moist air coming up from the south over the land will collide with the cool dry air from the polar jet stream that still pushes south from the north causing the development of thunderstorms and squall lines.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-a-massive-danger-of-storm-surges-along-the-atlantic-and-gulf-coast-coastlines-of-the-united-states>Why is there a massive danger of storm surges along the Atlantic and Gulf Coast coastlines of the United States?</h2>
<p>The storms produce strong winds that push the water into shore, which can lead to flooding. This makes storm surges very dangerous for coastal regions.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-gulf-of-mexico-affect-the-weather>How does the Gulf of Mexico affect the weather?</h2>
<p>How does the Gulf Stream impact weather and climate? This strong current of warm water influences the climate of the east coast of Florida, keeping temperatures there warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer than the other southeastern states.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-areas-most-vulnerable-to-storm-surge>Where are areas most vulnerable to storm surge?</h2>
<p>Locations along the Gulf of Mexico are extremely vulnerable to storm surge, in terms of both height and inland extent due to a wide and flat continental shelf over the majority of the region and low-lying land elevations extending well inland. Puerto Rico, USVI, Hawaii, and Hispaniola are also vulnerable to storm surge and wave impacts.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-gulf-coast-uniquely-vulnerable-to-disasters>Why is the Gulf Coast uniquely vulnerable to disasters?</h2>
<p>The Gulf Coast is an extreme example of this, a laboratory for what happens when you combine lax planning policies, aging flood-control mechanisms, and a geography that channels storms from the warm (and warming) waters of the Gulf into the cities that line it.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-storms-in-the-gulf-of-mexico>Why are there so many storms in the Gulf of Mexico?</h2>
<p>It should be clear that’s not the main cause of the storm. Climate change is not solely responsible for the storm. These kinds of storms have happened. What climate change might have influenced and very much did influence is the strength of the storm. We know that the Gulf of Mexico serves as the brewing pot, if you will.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-the-storm-surge-in-a-hurricane>What causes the storm surge in a hurricane?</h2>
<p>According to NOAA’s National Weather Service, storm surge occurs when strong hurricane winds blow along the ocean surface and cause water to pile up as it approaches the shoreline. Low pressure at the storm’s center causes water to bulge upward.</p>
