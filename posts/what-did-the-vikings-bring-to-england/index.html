<h2 id=what-did-the-vikings-bring-to-england>What did the Vikings bring to England?</h2>
<p>Some came to fight, but others came to Britain to live peacefully. Their longships brought families who settled in villages. There were farmers, who kept animals and grew crops, and skilful craft workers, who made beautiful metalwork and wooden carvings. Everyone lived together in a large home called a longhouse.</p>
<h2 id=what-2-skills-were-the-vikings-famous-for>What 2 skills were the Vikings famous for?</h2>
<p>The Vikings were highly skilled craftspeople. They built seagoing ships and made their own weapons and armour. These skills increased their success in trade and, later, in the search for and conquest of new lands. The Vikings were expert shipbuilders with easy access to the timber of Scandinavia’s forests.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-vikings-influence-england>Did the Vikings influence England?</h2>
<p>Vikings immigrated to England Because of the lack of land in Scandinavia during the 9th and 10th-century, tens of thousands of people from Norway and Denmark crossed the sea and sailed to the British Isles to settle in England.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-vikings-bring-to-britain-ks2>What did the Vikings bring to Britain ks2?</h2>
<p>They were farmers, and kept animals and grew crops. They were skilful at crafting, and made beautiful metalwork and wooden carvings. Vikings sailed the seas trading goods to buy silver, silks, spices, wine, jewellery, glass and pottery to bring back to their homes.</p>
<h2 id=what-marked-the-end-of-the-vikings-in-england>What marked the end of the Vikings in England?</h2>
<p>1066<br>
The events of 1066 in England effectively marked the end of the Viking Age. By that time, all of the Scandinavian kingdoms were Christian, and what remained of Viking “culture” was being absorbed into the culture of Christian Europe.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-the-vikings-so-brutal>Why were the Vikings so brutal?</h2>
<p>Vikings would target monasteries along the coast, raid the towns for their booty, and destroy what was left. This caused mass fear amongst such monks, as they felt that it was punishment from God. From their point of view, the Vikings were violent and evil heathens.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-vikings-invent-english>Did the Vikings invent English?</h2>
<p>And one of the largest influences on the development of modern-day English comes from the Vikings. They came from Denmark, Sweden and Norway, partly to rob, partly to invade and settle, and the legacy of language they left behind remains indelibly marked in English dictionaries to this day.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-most-feared-viking-warrior>Who was the most feared Viking warrior?</h2>
<p>Top 10 Toughest Viking Warriors</p>
<ul>
<li>Sweyn Forkbeard.</li>
<li>Harald Hardrada.</li>
<li>Bjorn Ironside.</li>
<li>Gunnar Hamundarson.</li>
<li>Erik the Red.</li>
<li>Ragnar Lodbrok.</li>
<li>Ivar the Boneless.</li>
<li>Egil Skallagrimsson. The warrior-poet Egil started at an early age; he wrote his first poem when he was three and killed another boy with an axe when he was seven.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-did-the-vikings-do-for-the-world>What did the Vikings do for the world?</h2>
<p>Take a look at just a few things we can thank the Vikings for: 1. Language The Vikings first attacked England in A.D. 793 and while they never successfully conquered the entire land, they did continue to attempt for several centuries and even formed several settlements on English soil.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-vikings-change-the-english-language>How did the Vikings change the English language?</h2>
<p>Vikings changed the English language Because of the immigration from Scandinavia, the language the newcomers spoke had a big influence on the English language. It is difficult to say if it was the Danes or Norwegians who affected the English language the most because the two languages are so similar.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-vikings-first-come-to-england>Where did the Vikings first come to England?</h2>
<p>Initially, these were the Norwegians, who in 793 pillaged Lindisfarne, and soon founded colonies in Ireland, on the Orkney and Shetland Islands. In the first half of the 9th century, Danish raids began. The disintegration of the English state in the middle of the 9th century allowed the Vikings to proceed to the systematic conquest of England.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-technology-did-the-vikings-have>What kind of Technology did the Vikings have?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most striking of Viking achievements was their state-of-the-art shipbuilding technology, which allowed them to travel greater distances than anyone before them.</p>
