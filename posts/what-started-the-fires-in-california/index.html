<h2 id=what-started-the-fires-in-california>What started the fires in California?</h2>
<p>After a very meticulous and thorough investigation, CAL FIRE has determined that the Camp Fire was caused by electrical transmission lines owned and operated by Pacific Gas and Electricity (PG&E) located in the Pulga area. The fire started in the early morning hours near the community of Pulga in Butte County.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-california-wildfires-start-2020>Why did the California wildfires start 2020?</h2>
<p>This summer saw the hottest August in state history, record-breaking temperatures, drought, and 14,000 dry lightning strikes in three days, resulting in a round of fires that quickly grew, stretching firefighting resources thin.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-california-burning-so-much>Why is California burning so much?</h2>
<p>California, like much of the West, gets most of its moisture in the fall and winter. Its vegetation then spends much of the summer slowly drying out because of a lack of rainfall and warmer temperatures. That vegetation then serves as kindling for fires.</p>

2020 California wildfires/Location</p>
<h2 id=how-many-have-died-in-the-california-wildfires-2020>How many have died in the California wildfires 2020?</h2>
<p>31 fatalities<br>
This section focuses on the significant fires in California. As of Dec. 3, 2020, there had been 9,279 fire incidents in California with 4,197,628 total acres burned. There were 10,488 structures damaged or destroyed and at least 31 fatalities.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-wildfire-in-california>What is the biggest wildfire in California?</h2>
<p>Dixie Fire<br>
The Dixie Fire is the largest single fire in California history and the largest currently burning in the U.S. It is about half the size of the August Complex, a series of lightning-caused 2020 fires across seven counties that were fought together and that state officials consider California’s largest wildfire overall.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-dixie-fire-the-largest-fire-in-california-history>Is the Dixie Fire the largest fire in California history?</h2>
<p>The Dixie Fire, which has incinerated over 500,000 acres, is the second-largest recorded wildfire in state history. It’s the largest wildfire in California, having destroyed more than 500 homes and most of historic downtown Greenville. The Dixie Fire spared the tiny town of Chester in Northern California.</p>
<h2 id=is-climate-change-causing-fires-in-california>Is climate change causing fires in California?</h2>
<p>The science is clear. Climate change plays an undeniable role in the unprecedented wildfires of recent years. More than half of the acres burned each year in the western United States can be attributed to climate change. For wildfires, fuel treatments like prescribed burns have become a salient example.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-wildfires-in-california-get-started>How did the wildfires in California get started?</h2>
<p>According to the National Weather Service (NWS), most fires start from lightning, especially where the ground is dry and easily ignited. “The majority of these lightning-caused wildfires occur in the absence [of], or very little rain,” the NWS website says. “When this occurs, the lightning is commonly referred to as “dry lightning”.”</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-last-fire-start-in-california>When did the last fire start in California?</h2>
<p>About this data This map shows the perimeters of wildfires that have burned in California from 1878 to 2018 using data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protectionand the U.S. Geological Survey. The wildfires are categorized by the year in which they started.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-thomas-fire-start-in-california>When did the Thomas Fire start in California?</h2>
<p>The wildfires are categorized by the year in which they started. Perimeter information from fires that started between 1878 and 2017 comes from Cal Fire, while information on the Thomas Fire and fires that started in 2018 comes from the USGS.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-are-the-wildfires-in-california-right-now>How big are the wildfires in California right now?</h2>
<p>That left the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection with less than half the number of inmate fire crews it typically has in August, peak wildfire season. In recent days, Cal Fire announced it reached full containment on two of the largest lightning complexes that began in the dry August heat: the LNU Complex and SCU Complex.</p>
