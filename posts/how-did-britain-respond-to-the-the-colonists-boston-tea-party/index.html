<p>The news of the Boston Tea Party reached London, England on January 20, 1774, and as a result the British shut down Boston Harbor until all of the 340 chests of British East India Company tea were paid for. This was implemented under the 1774 Intolerable Acts and known as the Boston Port Act.</p>

<p>The Intolerable Acts were a set of punitive acts that were enforced in America as a retaliation against the Boston Tea Party.</p>

<p>The Intolerable Acts<br>
The Intolerable Acts (passed/Royal assent March 31 – 22 June 1774) were punitive laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774 after the Boston Tea Party. The laws were meant to punish the Massachusetts colonists for their defiance in the Tea Party protest in reaction to changes in taxation by the British Government.</p>

<p>Furthermore, under the Intolerable Acts, criminal trials of royal officials could be moved to Britain, rather than held in the colonies. Finally, the Quartering Act allowed Britain to house its troops in private homes. The intention of these laws was to punish Massachusetts in response to the Boston Tea Party.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonists-dump-tea-in-the-harbor>Why did the colonists dump tea in the harbor?</h2>
<p>When the colonists dumped the tea in the harbor at Boston, the British East India Company lost a significant amount of money. To punish the colonies, especially those in Massachusetts, for this action, the British passed the Intolerable Acts. These were harsh laws designed to punish the colonists.</p>
