<h2 id=how-many-hurricanes-strike-each-year>How many hurricanes strike each year?</h2>
<p>A typical year has 12 named storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. Since all 21 of the letters of the alphabet that meteorologists use were exhausted, they began using the Greek alphabet to name storms. A record-breaking eleven named storms or hurricanes made landfall in the continental United States.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hurricanes-do-we-average-a-year>How many hurricanes do we average a year?</h2>
<p>The number of hurricanes in categories 3-5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale has increased from on average of around 1.6 per year in the 1970s and 1980s to an average of 3.1-3.8 per year in the 2000s and 2010s. Climate change has been identified as a reason why stronger hurricanes occur.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-hurricanes-hit-the-same-place>How often do hurricanes hit the same place?</h2>
<p>As if the 2020 hurricane season needed another reason to be remembered, meteorologists are now predicting two hurricanes may hit near the same location at about the same time.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-hurricanes-occur-in-one-year>How often do hurricanes occur in one year?</h2>
<p>A different amount of hurricanes occurs each year. The most hurricanes that have ever happened in a single year in the Atlantic Basin are 12, and the least is two. The Eastern Pacific has had anywhere from four to 14 in one year. Hurricane is a Caribbean Indian word that means “evil spirit and big wind.”.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-hurricanes-and-tropical-storms-ranked-in-the-world>How are hurricanes and tropical storms ranked in the world?</h2>
<p>The cities and islands listed below are ranked 1 through 50 with the amount of years between a Storm or Hurricane (inc post tropical) coming within or near the core of that city or island. This ranking method is based on tracking charts dating back to 1871 from every Hurricane Season in the atlantic basin.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-hurricanes-strike-in-the-united-states>When do hurricanes strike in the United States?</h2>
<p>There was one strike in both June and November, while July has seen eight strikes and October has recorded 11 strikes. Hurricanes predominately strike from the southeast in the first four months of the season, and then from the southwest in October and November.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-have-died-in-tropical-storms>How many people have died in tropical storms?</h2>
<p>Over the course of human history, hundreds of tropical storms have affected countries throughout the world, leading to billions of dollars’ worth of damages, alongside tens of thousands of deaths, as pointed out by hurricane statistics.</p>
