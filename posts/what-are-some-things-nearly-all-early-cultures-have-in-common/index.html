<p>In the early civilizations, there were many things in common, and they can fall into five facets including agriculture, socialization, and hierarchy, industry, architecture and religion.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-our-civilization-depend-on>What does our civilization depend on?</h2>
<p>Answer: The advent of civilization depended on the ability of some agricultural settlements to consistently produce surplus food, which allowed some people to specialize in non-agricultural work, which in turn allowed for increased production, trade, population, and social stratification.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-some-of-the-process-that-influenced-the-formation-of-early-civilization>What were some of the process that influenced the formation of early civilization?</h2>
<p>The earliest civilizations developed between 4000 and 3000 BCE, when the rise of agriculture and trade allowed people to have surplus food and economic stability. Many people no longer had to practice farming, allowing a diverse array of professions and interests to flourish in a relatively confined area.</p>
<h2 id=what-made-a-civilization>What made a civilization?</h2>
<p>A civilization is a complex human society, usually made up of different cities, with certain characteristics of cultural and technological development. In many parts of the world, early civilizations formed when people began coming together in urban settlements.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-most-cultures-have-in-common>What do most cultures have in common?</h2>
<p>All cultures have characteristics such as initiations, traditions, history, values and principles, purpose, symbols, and boundaries.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-importance-of-early-civilizations>What are the importance of early civilizations?</h2>
<p>An ancient civilization is a topic that helps students have a better understanding of the world. For example, when relating ancient civilizations to humanities and social sciences it helps students understand the economic and political commonalities and differences among cultures, people, and the environment.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-ancient-china-and-india-similar-and-different>How are ancient China and India similar and different?</h2>
<p>Ancient China and ancient India are both important and interesting ancient civilizations. They are alike and unlike in many ways. Some significant ways in which ancient India and China are similar and different are religion, art, economics, politics, and social structure. Ancient China and ancient India both consider religion to be very important.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-urban-civilization-in-india>Where was the first urban civilization in India?</h2>
<p>Timeline of the history of ancient India: The detail of the Alexander Mosaic showing Alexander the Great. Urban civilization first appeared in ancient India with the Indus Valley civilization in the early third millennium BCE, in what is today Pakistan and north-west India.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-indus-valley-civilization-start-in-india>When did the Indus Valley Civilization start in India?</h2>
<p>232 BCE: Asoka dies; shortly after, the decline of the Mauryan empire sets in Urban civilization first appeared in ancient India with the Indus Valley civilization in the early third millennium BCE, in what is today Pakistan and north-west India.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-top-characteristics-of-ancient-civilizations>What are the top characteristics of ancient civilizations?</h2>
<p>K. Kris Hirst Updated August 29, 2019 The phrase “top characteristics of civilization” refers both to the features of societies that rose to greatness in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, China’s Yellow River, Mesoamerica, the Andes Mountains in South America and others, as well as to the reasons or explanations for the rise of those cultures.</p>
