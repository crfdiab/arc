<h2 id=who-did-elizabeth-claim-she-married-to>Who did Elizabeth claim she married to?</h2>
<p>Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, his second wife, who was executed when Elizabeth was 21⁄2 years old. Anne’s marriage to Henry VIII was annulled, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate….</p>
<table><tr><th>Elizabeth I</th></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Anne Boleyn</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Church of England</td></tr><tr><td>Signature</td><td></td></tr></table>
<h2 id=who-supported-queen-elizabeth-1>Who supported Queen Elizabeth 1?</h2>
<p>Mary Tudor and their cousin, Lady Jane Grey, both were in line for the crown. Edward had appointed Grey to be his successor. Her reign proved to be very short: Mary gained the support of the English people and unseated Grey after only nine days on the throne.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-queen-elizabeth-refuse-to-marry>Who did Queen Elizabeth refuse to marry?</h2>
<p>Consequently, the Scots revolted and Mary was forced to abdicate and ‘yield the throne to her thirteen-month-old son, now James VI. ‘ This dramatic series of events within Scotland shows in itself Elizabeth’s wisdom in not marrying Robert Dudley in 1560.</p>

<h2 id=why-was-elizabeth-better-off-with-mary-queen-of-scots>Why was Elizabeth better off with Mary Queen of Scots?</h2>
<p>Mary was a problem. She’d been deposed from her own throne of Scotland and fled to her cousin Elizabeth for help. Elizabeth was actually better off with Mary’s son, James, on the throne. James was Protestant, like Elizabeth, and unlike Mary, he wasn’t making claims on Elizabeth’s throne.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-and-queen-of-england>Who was the king and Queen of England?</h2>
<p>Robert Dudley – Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, was an ambitious, good looking courtier. Elizabeth spent a lot of time… King Philip of Spain – In the 1560s, King Philip proposed to Elizabeth. He was a Catholic who had been married to Mary,… Archduke Charles – In 1567 Elizabeth considered …</p>
