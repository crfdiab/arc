<h2 id=what-was-the-first-capital-city-of-new-zealand>What was the first capital city of New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Okiato<br>
The story of NZ’s three capitals New Zealand has had three capital cities – first Okiato (Old Russell) in the Bay of Islands from 1840, then a year later, Auckland, and finally Wellington. Today marks 155 years since a session of parliament officially met in Wellington for the first time on 26 July 1865.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-māori-live-in-new-zealand>How many Māori live in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>New Zealand’s estimated Māori ethnic population was 850,500 (or 16.7 percent of national population). There were 423,700 Māori males and 426,800 Māori females.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-city-in-new-zealand>Which is the largest city in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Today, the capital of New Zealand continues to be in Wellington. This city is the most populated in the country, with 405,000 residents. It is located at the most southwestern point of North Island, and the entire metro area covers approximately 536 square miles.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-second-capital-of-new-zealand>What was the second capital of New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Auckland was the second capital from 1841 until 1865, when Parliament was permanently moved to Wellington after an argument that persisted for a decade. As the members of parliament could not agree on the location of a more central capital, Wellington was decided on by three Australian commissioners.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-new-zealand-move-its-capital-from-auckland-to-wellington>When did New Zealand move its capital from Auckland to Wellington?</h2>
<p>The move of the capital from Auckland to Wellington was undertaken in 1865, and Wellington has been New Zealand’s capital since. The fifth session of the 3rd Parliament was opened on 26 July 1865 in Wellington, and this date is regarded as the move of the capital function to Wellington. 150th anniversary</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-capital-of-new-zealand-before-hobson>Where was the capital of New Zealand before Hobson?</h2>
<p>Mathew drew up ambitious plans for a town, but only one of the intended roads was ever built – leading directly from the town hall to the town jail. A year later Hobson moved the capital to Auckland and most of the Russell (i.e. Okiato) residents moved there too.</p>
