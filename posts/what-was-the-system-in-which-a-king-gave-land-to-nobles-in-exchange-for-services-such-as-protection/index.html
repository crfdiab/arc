<h2 id=what-was-the-system-in-which-a-king-gave-land-to-nobles-in-exchange-for-services-such-as-protection>What was the system in which a king gave land to nobles in exchange for services such as protection?</h2>
<p>Feudalism was a set of legal and military customs in medieval Europe that flourished between the 9th and 15th centuries. It can be broadly defined as a system for structuring society around relationships derived from the holding of land, known as a fiefdom or fief, in exchange for service or labour.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-kings-give-to-nobles-in-exchange-for-loyalty>What did Kings give to nobles in exchange for loyalty?</h2>
<p>To supply knights to the monarch, the noble would often divide his fief of land among several men in exchange for their pledge of loyalty to the noble. In exchange for working the noble’s land, they were given small plots of land, some of the food they produced on their plots, and shelter.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-kings-give-to-nobles-in-feudalism>What did Kings give to nobles in feudalism?</h2>
<p>The king granted fiefs (portions of land) to nobles (lords or barons) in return for loyalty, protection and service. The king could also grant fiefs to vassals (knights) in exchange for military service.</p>
<h2 id=what-system-was-brought-in-order-and-protection-to-western-europe>What system was brought in order and protection to Western Europe?</h2>
<p>feudalism, also called feudal system or feudality, French féodalité, historiographic construct designating the social, economic, and political conditions in western Europe during the early Middle Ages, the long stretch of time between the 5th and 12th centuries.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-vassal-king>What is a vassal king?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-the-best-description-of-the-manor>What is the best description of the manor?</h2>
<p>A manor was usually comprised of tracts of agricultural land, a village whose inhabitants worked that land, and a manor house where the lord who owned or controlled the estate lived. Manors might also have had woods, orchards, gardens, and lakes or ponds where fish could be found.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-system-was-a-manor-system-quizlet>What type of system was a manor system quizlet?</h2>
<p>An economic system in the Middle Ages that was built around large estates called manors. It includes a village and the land surrounding it. They were self-sufficient. Most things they needed for daily life were produced there.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-vassal-give-the-lord>What did the vassal give the lord?</h2>
<p>Under the feudal contract, the lord had the duty to provide the fief for his vassal, to protect him, and to do him justice in his court. The vassal owed fealty to his lord.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-nobles-own-most-of-the-land-in-europe>Where did nobles own most of the land in Europe?</h2>
<p>With the nobility, they owned more than three-quarters of the land: in contrast, in France by 1789 the nobility owned barely a third. In northern and eastern Europe, where the social structure was generally simpler than in the west, nobles— dvoriane in Russia, szlachta in Poland and Hungary—were numerous.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-nobles-and-knights-do-for-peasants>What did nobles and knights do for peasants?</h2>
<p>In return for working on their land, nobles, kings, and knights protected peasants from invasions when they occurred. A freeman is a peasant who pays money or food for their land, but a villein has to work part-time for their lord to earn the land.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-nobles-in-the-feudal-system>Who are the nobles in the feudal system?</h2>

<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-nobles-in-the-18th-century>What was the role of nobles in the 18th century?</h2>
<p>Nobles played a decorative role in the most ceremonious court in 18th-century Europe. Charles VI (1711–40) had provided 40,000 posts for noble clients. Maria Theresa, concerned about expense, reduced the number of chamberlains to 1,500. It was left to her son Joseph II to attack noble privileges at every point,…</p>
