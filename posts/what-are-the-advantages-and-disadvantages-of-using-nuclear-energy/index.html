<p>Advantages and disadvantages of nuclear power stations</p>
<table><tr><th>Advantages</th><th>Disadvantages</th></tr><tr><td>Produces no polluting gases.</td><td>Waste is radioactive and safe disposal is very difficult and expensive.</td></tr><tr><td>Does not contribute to global warming.</td><td>Local thermal pollution from wastewater affects marine life.</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-an-advantage-of-nuclear-energy-quizlet>What is an advantage of nuclear energy quizlet?</h2>
<p>Nuclear energy has some advantages over traditional methods of producing electricity. It has little impact on air quality and is more efficient than traditional methods of producing electricity. It does, however, use a nonrenewable resource, uranium.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-better-to-use-nuclear-energy>Why is it better to use nuclear energy?</h2>
<p>Nuclear power releases less radiation into the environment than any other major energy source. Second, nuclear power plants operate at much higher capacity factors than renewable energy sources or fossil fuels. Nuclear is a clear winner on reliability.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-nuclear-energy-quizlet>What are advantages and disadvantages of nuclear energy quizlet?</h2>
<p>Terms in this set (16)</p>
<ul>
<li>– Some low level is allowed to be discharged into the enviroment becuae the activity is very low.</li>
<li>The amount of fuel needed is much less than for a fossil fuel.</li>
<li>No carbon dioxide is produced by a nuclear power station when it is generating power.</li>
<li>The risk of an accident happening is very low.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-are-disadvantages-of-nuclear-power>Which of the following are disadvantages of nuclear power?</h2>
<p>Here are some of the main cons of nuclear energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Expensive to Build. Despite being relatively inexpensive to operate, nuclear power plants are incredibly expensive to build—and the cost keeps rising.</li>
<li>Accidents.</li>
<li>Produces Radioactive Waste.</li>
<li>Impact on the Environment.</li>
<li>Security Threat.</li>
<li>Limited Fuel Supply.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-advantages-of-nuclear-power>What are some of the advantages of nuclear power?</h2>
<p>The most advantages of nuclear enery are found during the power generation. The generation of electricity through nuclear energy reduces the amount of energy generated from fossil fuels (carbon and petroleum).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-nuclear-power-an-environmentally-friendly-energy-source>Why is nuclear power an environmentally friendly energy source?</h2>
<p>Compared with other types of energy, nuclear power stands out as an environmentally friendly energy source. Nuclear power generates clean energy by bombarding uranium with neutrons as opposed to burning fossil fuels.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-nuclear-power-plants-better-than-fossil-fuels>How are nuclear power plants better than fossil fuels?</h2>
<p>A nuclear power plant also uses comparatively less fuel than other power plants. The energy released by nuclear fission, for instance, is approximately ten million times greater than the amount of energy released by the atom in fossil fuels.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-nuclear-power-in-uk>Why do we need nuclear power in UK?</h2>
<p>There’s a huge and ongoing demand for electricity in the UK – think about your everyday routine and how much of that relies on energy. We have a responsibility to keep powering our homes, workplaces and cities – but we also have a responsibility to the planet. So we need to make sure we are low-carbon and environmentally friendly.</p>
