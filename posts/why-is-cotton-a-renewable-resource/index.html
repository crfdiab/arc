<h2 id=why-is-cotton-a-renewable-resource>Why is cotton a renewable resource?</h2>
<p>Farmers harvest and replant cotton annually, making it an extremely renewable resource. With its high tolerance to heat and drought, cotton thrives under adverse conditions and can therefore be grown in areas that support few other useful crops.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-wood-a-renewable-resource>Why is wood a renewable resource?</h2>
<p>Wood is an example, obtained from the harvesting of trees. It is renewable because trees can be planted and regrown within our life time. Once non-renewable resources are used, they cannot be replenished within our life time.</p>
<h2 id=is-cotton-a-renewable-natural-resource>Is cotton a renewable natural resource?</h2>
<p>Cotton is sustainable, renewable, and biodegradable, making it an excellent choice as an environmentally-friendly fiber throughout its entire product life cycle. Most chemical fibers are petroleum based, which means they come from nonrenewable resources. The average acre in the U.S. produces about 800 pounds of cotton.</p>
<h2 id=is-wood-a-renewable-natural-resource>Is wood a renewable natural resource?</h2>
<p>Wood gets its energy from the sun and nutrients in the soil and is a type of biomass fuel (see Facts about Biomass Fuels). Wood is a renewable resource, which means that additional resources can be grown to replace any wood that is cut down.</p>
<h2 id=is-cotton-renewable-or-finite>Is cotton renewable or finite?</h2>
<p>Non-finite resources are found naturally and can be replaced. Examples include wood, cotton and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-examples-of-renewable-natural-resources>What are some examples of renewable natural resources?</h2>
<p>Renewable resources include biomass energy (such as ethanol), hydropower, geothermal power, wind energy, and solar energy. Biomass refers to organic material from plants or animals. This includes wood, sewage, and ethanol (which comes from corn or other plants).</p>
<h2 id=is-cotton-and-leather-renewable-resources>Is cotton and leather renewable resources?</h2>
<p>Background: Earth’s resources can be used for the energy they contain. Our clothing comes from plants (cotton, rayon), animals (leather, wool, down, silk) and petroleum (polyesters, acrylics). Some natural resources we use are renewable (plants, animals, air, water).</p>
<h2 id=is-water-renewable-or-finite>Is water renewable or finite?</h2>
<p>Water is a finite resource: there are some 1 400 million cubic kilometres on earth and circulating through the hydrological cycle. Nearly all of this is salt water and most of the rest is frozen or under ground. Only one-hundredth of 1 percent of the world’s water is readily available for human use.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-that-cotton-is-a-renewable-resource>Is it true that cotton is a renewable resource?</h2>
<p>Yes, cotton is a renewable resource because it can be planted and harvested year after year. Cotton also tends to be biodegradable, so it can replace… See full answer below. Our experts can answer your tough homework and study questions. Today, cotton is used in a variety of everyday work, products, and processes.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-wood-used-as-a-renewable-resource>How is wood used as a renewable resource?</h2>
<p>Wood is a renewable natural resource. Wood is produced sustainably. The use of wood can be considerably increased. Wood as a carbon sink. Carbon is bound in wood structures for a long time. Wood product production produces more energy than it consumes. Timber construction as an enabler of low-carbon property development.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-useful-renewable-natural-resource>Which is the most useful renewable natural resource?</h2>
<p>Trees are one of the most useful renewable natural resources. We use trees to produce almost 8,000 different things, like this cardboard box. Wood is used to make most of these products.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-timber-considered-to-be-a-sustainable-resource>Why is timber considered to be a sustainable resource?</h2>
<p>Timber, a sustainable and Renewable Resource Teacher Overview Timber, a Sustainable and Renewable Resource. The aim of this unit is for students to investigate how and why wood is considered to be a sustainable and renewable resource.</p>
