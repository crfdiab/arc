<h2 id=on-what-date-does-christmas-begin-in-sweden>On what date does Christmas begin in Sweden?</h2>
<p>Start of the Christmas Season In Sweden, Christmas begins with Saint Lucia Day on December 13. The date commemorates Saint Lucy (or Lucia in Scandinavian countries).</p>
<h2 id=does-it-snow-in-sweden-at-christmas>Does it snow in Sweden at Christmas?</h2>
<p>Weather In Sweden In December During December, Sweden is said to be completely drenched in snow. It is the best month among snow lovers and the ultimate place for fun winter activities. The average temperature in De cember ranges between -1.0°C and 3.0°C.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-christmas-on-the-24th-in-europe>Why is Christmas on the 24th in Europe?</h2>
<p>The Europeans celebrate Christmas on the 24th instead of the 25th of December is because they are celebrating the night that Sinterklaas aka Santa Claus is flying over the earth. They hold that with just as much importance as the Christians do when they celebrate Christ on the 25th.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-people-get-their-christmas-presents-in-sweden>When do people get their Christmas presents in Sweden?</h2>
<p>This is probably the main reasons so many Swedes drive a Volvo kombi (station wagon) with a lots of trunk space. When will I get my Christmas presents in Sweden? On Christmas eve, the 24th of December and not on the morning of the 25th. Good for kids with little patience. Until afternoon of the 24th most shops and supermarkets are still open.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-christmas-and-midsummers-day-celebrated-in-sweden>When is Christmas and Midsummer’s Day celebrated in Sweden?</h2>
<p>In Sweden many holiday celebrations are not on the day of the holiday, but on the eve of the holiday. For example the main celebration for Christmas is on Christmas Eve and the main celebration Midsummer’s Day will be held on Midsummer’s Eve.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-holidays-do-they-have-in-sweden>What kind of holidays do they have in Sweden?</h2>
<p>For example the main celebration for Christmas is on Christmas Eve and the main celebration Midsummer’s Day will be held on Midsummer’s Eve. Easter in Sweden is celebrated by children dressing up as witches and going door-to-door- in their neighborhood asking for treats.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-they-buy-christmas-trees-in-sweden>Where do they buy Christmas trees in Sweden?</h2>
<p>Almost all Swedish living rooms are decorated with a christmas tree. This tree is usually bought on the parking lot outside a supermarket – or illegally taken from the nearby woods. This is probably the main reasons so many Swedes drive a Volvo kombi (station wagon) with a lots of trunk space. When will I get my Christmas presents in Sweden?</p>
