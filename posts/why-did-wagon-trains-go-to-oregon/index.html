<h2 id=why-did-wagon-trains-go-to-oregon>Why did wagon trains go to Oregon?</h2>
<p>In what was dubbed “The Great Migration of 1843” or the “Wagon Train of 1843”, an estimated 700 to 1,000 emigrants left for Oregon. He believed the wagon trains were large enough that they could build whatever road improvements they needed to make the trip with their wagons.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-it-like-to-travel-in-a-covered-wagon>What was it like to travel in a covered wagon?</h2>
<p>Dreary times, wet and muddy, and crowded in the tent, cold and wet and uncomfortable in the wagon no place for the poor children…” Sometimes Amelia Stewart Knight and her family had to sleep “in wet beds, with their wet clothes on, without supper.” Sick or well, Amelia had chores to do; and they were endless.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-reason-pioneers-traveled-in-wagon-trains>What is the main reason pioneers traveled in wagon trains?</h2>
<p>Pioneers traveling west across hundreds and thousands of miles needed supplies, guides and protection to help them make the often treacherous journey. Wagon Trains were formed to allow groups to reduce the dangers associated with the long journey west.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-a-wagon-train-to-travel>How long does it take for a wagon train to travel?</h2>
<p>The front wheels were usually smaller than those at the back. The wagon train would travel at around two miles an hour. This enabled the emigrants to average ten miles a day. With good weather the 2,000 mile journey from Missouri to California and Oregon would take about five months. However, heavy rains would increase this by several weeks.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-wagon-train-arrive-in-oregon>When did the first wagon train arrive in Oregon?</h2>
<p>It was not until 1843 that the celebrated “cow column” Oregon emigrant party of about one thousand persons brought most of its 120 wagons over the trail to arrive near the Columbia River on 10 October, the first wagon train to reach Oregon Country.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-wheels-did-the-wagon-train-have>What kind of wheels did the wagon train have?</h2>
<p>The four wheels of the wagon were made of wood (strengthened with iron). The front wheels were usually smaller than those at the back. The wagon train would travel at around two miles an hour.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-wagon-train-not-very-comfortable>Why was the wagon train not very comfortable?</h2>
<p>A few fortunate few had horses but normally those were the wealthy and the hired guide and scouts. Wagon trains were also not very comfortable because of the amount of noise. Imagine the continual drone of clomping feet and the hollow sound of the wagons bouncing through the ruts.</p>
