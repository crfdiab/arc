<h2 id=what-is-the-theory-of-david-ricardo-all-about>What is the theory of David Ricardo all about?</h2>
<p>Comparative advantage, economic theory, first developed by 19th-century British economist David Ricardo, that attributed the cause and benefits of international trade to the differences in the relative opportunity costs (costs in terms of other goods given up) of producing the same commodities among countries.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-david-ricardo-and-what-is-he-famous-for>Who is David Ricardo and what is he famous for?</h2>
<p>David Ricardo, (born April 18/19, 1772, London, England—died September 11, 1823, Gatcombe Park, Gloucestershire), English economist who gave systematized, classical form to the rising science of economics in the 19th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-ricardian-theory-of-value>What is Ricardian theory of value?</h2>
<p>Ricardo states, ▪ “If men employed no machinery in production but labour only, and were all the same length of time before they brought their commodities into the market, the exchangeable value of their goods would be precisely in proportion to the quantity of labour employed.”</p>
<h2 id=in-what-year-did-ricardo-formulate-the-theory>In what year did Ricardo formulate the theory?</h2>
<p>1815<br>
(more astoundingly, all of them published their tracts within three weeks in February, 1815!) In his 1815 Essay, Ricardo formulated his theory of distribution in a one-commodity (“corn”) economy.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-adam-smith-believe-in>What did Adam Smith believe in?</h2>
<p>Smith wanted people to practice thrift, hard work, and enlightened self-interest. He thought the practice of enlightened self-interest was natural for the majority of people. In his famous example, a butcher does not supply meat based on good-hearted intentions, but because he profits by selling meat.</p>
<h2 id=did-david-ricardo-believe-in-capitalism>Did David Ricardo believe in capitalism?</h2>
<p>Thus, profits would be directed toward landlords and away from the emerging industrial capitalists. Ricardo believed landlords tended to squander their wealth on luxuries, rather than invest. He believed the Corn Laws were leading to the stagnation of the British economy.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-marxs-theory-of-value>What is Marx’s theory of value?</h2>
<p>Like the other classical economists, Karl Marx believed in the labor theory of value to explain relative differences in market prices. This theory stated that the value of a produced economic good can be measured objectively by the average number of labor hours required to produce it.</p>
<h2 id=did-adam-smith-believe-in-free-market>Did Adam Smith believe in free market?</h2>
<p>Adam Smith described free markets as “an obvious and simple system of natural liberty.” He did not favor the landowner, the factory owner, or the worker, but rather all of society. He saw, however, self-defeating forces at work, preventing the full operation of the free market and undermining the wealth of all nations.</p>
<h2 id=did-adam-smith-believe-in-socialism>Did Adam Smith believe in socialism?</h2>
<p>Adam Smith was no socialist. In fact, he has often been described as “the father of capitalism.” Yet, despite this, if one were to read Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations these days without being told who wrote it, one might be inclined to believe it was an economic text written by a communist.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-labor-theory-of-value-is-right>Why the labor theory of value is right?</h2>
<p>The labor theory of value (LTV) was an early attempt by economists to explain why goods were exchanged for certain relative prices on the market. It suggested that the value of a commodity was determined by and could be measured objectively by the average number of labor hours necessary to produce it.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-ricardo-contribute-to-the-field-of-economics>What did Ricardo contribute to the field of Economics?</h2>
<p>Labor Theory of Value. Another of Ricardo’s best-known contributions to economics was the labor theory of value. The labor theory of value states that the value of a good could be measured by the labor that it took to produce it.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-conflict-between-ricardo-and-the-landlord>What was the conflict between Ricardo and the landlord?</h2>
<p>In his works, Ricardo expounded the conflict between the landlord’s interests and the capitalist’s interests. As a stockbroker who turned to an economist, Ricardo was fixated on methodologies and theories of value.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-john-ricardo-when-he-became-a-member-of-parliament>How old was John Ricardo when he became a Member of Parliament?</h2>
<p>After retiring at age 42, Ricardo purchased a seat in Parliament for £4,000, and he served as a member of Parliament. Influenced by Adam Smith, Ricardo held company with other leading thinkers such as James Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and Thomas Malthus.</p>
