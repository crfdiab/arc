<h2 id=when-did-captain-cook-return-to-england-from-australia>When did Captain Cook return to England from Australia?</h2>
<p>Cook reached the southern coast of New South Wales in 1770 and sailed north, charting Australia’s eastern coastline and claiming the land for Great Britain on 22nd August 1770.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-captain-cook-come-back-from-australia>When did Captain Cook come back from Australia?</h2>
<p>James Cook and some of his crew landed at Kamay Botany Bay on 29 April 1770. They spent the following months charting the continent’s eastern coastline, encountering Australian flora and fauna and interacting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from different nations.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-captain-cook-go-after-australia>Where did Captain Cook go after Australia?</h2>
<p>After the astronomical observations were completed, Cook sailed south to 40°S, but failed to find any land. He then headed for New Zealand, which he circumnavigated, establishing that there were two principal islands. From New Zealand he sailed to New Holland, which he first sighted in April 1770.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-one-of-britains-first-purpose-for-the-australian-colonies>What was one of Britain’s first purpose for the Australian colonies?</h2>
<p>By colonising Australia Britain gained an important base for its ships in the Pacific Ocean. It also gained an important resource in terms of being somewhere to send convicts. Until the American Revolution Britain could send convicts to the Thirteen Colonies.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-captain-james-cook-die-in-australia>How did Captain James Cook die in Australia?</h2>
<p>A statue of Captain James Cook vandalised in St Kilda, Melbourne, ahead of Australia Day 2018. Cook died on a Hawaii beach in 1779, stabbed in the neck by an islander. Mr Kelly feels strongly that Cook showed a lack of respect for Indigenous people and his ancestors in that first interaction.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-captain-cook-important-to-british-history>Why was Captain Cook important to British history?</h2>
<p>Captain Cook is considered one of the greatest navigators and explorers of all time and, even before his death, was celebrated as a British national hero and icon. Cook mapped the east coast of Australia – this paved the way for British settlement 18 years later. He also proved some theories to be wrong.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-captain-cook-chart-the-east-coast-of-australia>Where did Captain Cook chart the east coast of Australia?</h2>
<p>Once Cook completed his work on the Transit of Venus, he then proceeded to New Zealand where he mapped the coast and then continued to Australia, which was already known as New Holland. Cook and his crewmembers were the first known Europeans to see and chart the east coast of Australia in 1770.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-james-cook-do-in-new-zealand>What did James Cook do in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>James Cook was a naval captain, navigator and explorer who, in 1770, charted New Zealand and the Great Barrier Reef of Australia on his ship HMB Endeavour. He later disproved the existence of Terra…</p>
