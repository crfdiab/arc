<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-us-invasion-of-iraq-in-2003>What was the name of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003?</h2>
<p>American attack on Iraq 2003. The 2003 invasion of Iraq was the start of conflict known as Iraq war, or operation Iraqi freedom, in which a combined force of groups from united state, the United Kingdom, Austria and Poland invaded Iraq and toppled the regime of Saddam Husain in 21 days of major combat operation.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-us-air-strikes-in-iraq-and-syria>Are there US air strikes in Iraq and Syria?</h2>
<p>The US has conducted air strikes in Iraq and Syria against an Iran-backed Iraqi militia blamed for an attack that killed a US civilian contractor. Weapons caches and command and control centres at five sites associated with Kataib Hezbollah were hit on Sunday, the defence department said.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-iran-say-about-the-us-attack-on-iraq>What did Iran say about the US attack on Iraq?</h2>
<p>Iraq’s prime minister denounced the “violation of Iraqi sovereignty”, while Iran’s foreign ministry said the US strikes were a “clear example of terrorism”. The US contractor died when more than 30 rockets hit an Iraqi military base in the northern city of Kirkuk on Friday.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-americans-died-in-the-invasion-of-iraq>How many Americans died in the invasion of Iraq?</h2>
<p>From left to right: Marines of the U.S. 1st Marine Regiment escort Iraqi prisoners of war; a convoy of U.S. military vehicles in a sandstorm; U.S. soldiers watch an enemy building in Samawah burn; Iraqi civilians cheer as a statue of Saddam Hussein is toppled.

<h2 id=what-was-the-percentage-of-support-for-the-invasion-of-iraq>What was the percentage of support for the invasion of Iraq?</h2>
<p>In a March 2003 Gallup poll, the day after the invasion, 76% of Americans supported the military action against Iraq. In a March 2003 YouGov poll, 54% of Britons had approved of military action against Iraq.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-us-go-to-war-with-iraq>Why did the US go to war with Iraq?</h2>
<p>War is always caused by governments, not people, at least I believe so. The US invaded Iraq in 2003 because Iraq posed a threat to the peace of the West. The decision was controversial at the time, but the reason was clear.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-iraq-invade-kuwait-in-august-1990>When did Iraq invade Kuwait in August 1990?</h2>
<p>On august 2, 1990 Iraqi armed forces invaded Kuwait and occupied it swiftly just in the span of 6 hours.</p>
