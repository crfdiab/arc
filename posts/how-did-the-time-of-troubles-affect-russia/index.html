<h2 id=how-did-the-time-of-troubles-affect-russia>How did the Time of Troubles affect Russia?</h2>
<p>Russia experienced the famine of 1601–03, which killed a third of the population, within three years of Fyodor’s death. The Time of Troubles ended with the election of Michael Romanov as tsar by the Zemsky Sobor in 1613, establishing the Romanov dynasty which ruled Russia until the February Revolution in 1917.</p>
<h2 id=what-problems-were-encountered-by-the-russian-czars>What problems were encountered by the Russian czars?</h2>
<p>The Russian people faced severe hardship and poverty; they desired democratic participation, better worker’s rights, and land. The Tsar, although suitably informed of the problems by his court, was ultimately blind to the issues that plagued his subjects.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-beginning-of-the-17th-century-in-russia-called-the-time-of-troubles>Why is the beginning of the 17th century in Russia called the Time of Troubles?</h2>
<p>The beginning of the 17th century is known as the Time of Troubles which lasted from the death of Tsar Feodor – the last Ryurikid tsar – until the ascension of Tsar Michael – the first Romanov tsar. During this period various pretenders claimed the throne and the very existence of Russia was at threat.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-the-1780s-considered-a-time-of-troubles>Why were the 1780s considered a Time of Troubles?</h2>
<p>The economic problems faced by the Congress deeply touched the lives of most Americans in the 1780s. The war had disrupted much of the American economy. On the high seas the British navy had great superiority and destroyed most American ships, crippling the flow of trade.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-died-during-the-time-of-troubles>How many people died during the Time of Troubles?</h2>
<p>Violence in the Troubles. The conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century is known as the Troubles. Over 3,600 people were killed and thousands more injured. During a period of 30 years, many acts of violence were carried out by paramilitaries and the security forces.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-happening-in-russia-in-1914>What was happening in Russia in 1914?</h2>
<p>At Tannenberg and the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes, in 1914, Russia lost two entire armies (over 250,000 men).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-russia-like-in-the-17th-century>What was Russia like in the 17th century?</h2>
<p>The 17th century began with a period of political chaos. The ruling Muscovite dynasty came to an end in 1598. Before Michael Romanov was at last proclaimed tsar in 1613, Russia was convulsed by struggles for power, peasant rebellions, and foreign invasions.</p>
<h2 id=what-battle-was-the-turning-point-of-the-revolutionary-war-and-why>What battle was the turning point of the Revolutionary War and why?</h2>
<p>The Battle of Saratoga, comprising two significant battles during September and October of 1777, was a crucial victory for the Patriots during the American Revolution and is considered the turning point of the Revolutionary War.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-was-the-time-of-troubles-forgotten-realms>How long was the Time of Troubles Forgotten Realms?</h2>
<p>could be wrong, but that’ll probably be your closest resource. According to the Forgotten Realms Atlas (2E), The Time of Troubles began with the arrival of the gods in the Realms on 15-Kythorn (June), 1358 DR; and ran through 15-Marpenoth (October), 1358 DR.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-russia-have-a-conflict-with-kievan-rus>Why did Russia have a conflict with Kievan Rus?</h2>
<p>Its Orthodox religion allowed it to claim the heritage of Kievan Rus. Its autocracy gave it a fairly effective army. Russia also had a conflict between serfdom and frontier liberty, but its political consequences turned out to be less important.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-so-much-confusion-about-little-women>Why is there so much confusion about Little Women?</h2>
<p>Thanks to the confusing history of this plotline, as Greta Gerwig’s new movie hits theaters, it is high time some of the confusion and plot points surrounding Beth’s death are cleared up. For example, we get scarlet fever mentioned in hushed tones, and while Beth seems to initially get better, years later she seems to succumb to the disease.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-expansion-of-russia-so-successful>Why was the expansion of Russia so successful?</h2>
<p>Its plains, which are nestled between the Baltic and Black seas, offer a wealth of natural resources and room for expansion, especially with easy access to river routes. This explains the consistent settlement of this region. On the other hand, the location, did not offer natural barriers, making the settlements easy prey for invaders.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-england-go-to-war-with-russia>Why did England go to war with Russia?</h2>
<p>England formerly destroyed Spain through many wars. For the same reason it waged its wars against Holland. With the help of all of Europe it later fought France. Napoleon had actually made peace with Tsar Alexander I of Russia.</p>
