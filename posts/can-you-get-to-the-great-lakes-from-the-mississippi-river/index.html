<h2 id=can-you-get-to-the-great-lakes-from-the-mississippi-river>Can you get to the Great Lakes from the Mississippi River?</h2>
<p>From the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, and from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Ocean, you can get on a boat and travel eastern North America by contiguous waterways. The Great Loop offers over 6,000 miles of scenic cruising that can be taken in all at once or in portions.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-boat-from-lake-michigan-to-florida>Can you boat from Lake Michigan to Florida?</h2>
<p>In order to sail to the Great Lakes from Florida without demasting, requires traveling the St. Lawrence Seaway, but the inland canals are much shorter (and faster) so many boaters choose to demast and motor through the Erie, NY and/or Mississippi canal systems.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-boat-from-great-lakes-to-florida>Can you boat from Great Lakes to Florida?</h2>
<p>This nautical journey charts a 6,000-mile course from the Great Lakes to the Florida Keys (and back). The Great Loop takes boaters up the Atlantic seaboard, through historic canals, across the Great Lakes, down the inland rivers to the Gulf of Mexico, and around Florida.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-take-a-boat-from-the-great-lakes-to-the-gulf-of-mexico>Can you take a boat from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico?</h2>
<p>Ships sail a 1,530-mile inland waterway from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico via canals and tributaries that connect Lake Michigan to the Illinois River, which flows into the Mississippi.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-get-from-great-lakes-to-ocean>Can you get from Great Lakes to ocean?</h2>
<p>The Great Lakes are connected to the Atlantic Ocean through the St. Lawrence Seaway. Annually, approximately 4,000 ships pass through the St. Lawrence Seaway, carrying about $7 billion worth of commodities.</p>
<h2 id=when-should-i-start-the-great-loop>When should I start the Great Loop?</h2>
<p>Late June/Early July – A summer arrival in far upstate New York brings the ideal time to explore the Thousand Islands, Rideau Canal Loop to Ottawa, etc. Mid-July to Mid-August – Great time for the North Channel segment. Plenty of time to go as slow as you like here, it is the pinnacle of most Looper experiences.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-water-from-the-mississippi-river-go>Where does the water from the Mississippi River go?</h2>
<p>In the Mississippi River scenario, 675,000 acre-feet of water would be diverted from the nation’s largest river downstream of where it meets up with the Ohio River. From there, the water would be conveyed via tunnel, canal and a monstrous pipe 775 miles long and 144 inches in diameter to dump into the Navajo River in southwestern Colorado.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-boat-down-the-mississippi-river>Is it possible to boat down the Mississippi River?</h2>
<p>Can You Boat Down the Mississippi River? The short answer is: yes, you absolutely can boat down the Mississippi river. You cannot, however take more than a kayak or rowboat on the upper 482 miles of the Mississippi river. The navigable section of the river begins at Coon Rapids Dam in Minneapolis.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-float-down-the-mississippi-river>How long does it take to float down the Mississippi River?</h2>
<p>According to the National Park Service, it takes water 90 days to flow from Lake Itasca to the Gulf of Mexico. Source That timeframe doesn’t take any stops into account however so if you are a normal person attempting to float down the entire river it would take you approximately twice that long (6 months) to float down the Mississippi.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-only-navigable-waterway-in-florida>Which is the only navigable waterway in Florida?</h2>
<p>This peaceful waterway goes through miles of untouched Florida Everglades and thousands of acres of Old Florida scrub and ranchland. It is the only navigable cross Florida canal. Landlubbers can also enjoy the waterway at the various locks and parks along the route. It’s fun to watch the boats pass through the locks along the route.</p>
