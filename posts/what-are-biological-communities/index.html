<h2 id=what-are-biological-communities>What are biological communities?</h2>
<p>Community, also called biological community, in biology, an interacting group of various species in a common location. For example, a forest of trees and undergrowth plants, inhabited by animals and rooted in soil containing bacteria and fungi, constitutes a biological community.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-population-and-community-in-terms-of-biology>What are population and community in terms of biology?</h2>
<p>Individuals make up a population; populations make up a species; multiple species and their interactions make up a community; and multiple species and their interactions make up ecosystems when you include the abiotic factors.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-biological-population>What is biological population?</h2>
<p>In biology, a population is a number of all the organisms of the same group or species who live in a particular geographical area and are capable of interbreeding.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a-biological-community-consist-of>What does a biological community consist of?</h2>
<p>A biological community consist of All of the different population of species in one geographic area.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-biological-example>What is a biological example?</h2>
<p>The definition of biological is something that relates to life or living. An example of biological is water helping the kidneys flush waste and toxins from the body. An example of biological is a mother and her son to whom she gave birth.</p>

<p>Biological community. The members of a species living in a given area at the same time constitute a population. All the populations living and interacting within a particular geographic area make up a biological (or biotic) community. The living organisms in a community together with their nonliving or abiotic environment make up an ecosystem .</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-population-community>What is the difference between a population, community?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-individual-and-species-in-a-community>What is individual and species in a community?</h2>
<p>What is individual and species, community and population. What is a biological community?</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-up-a-population-in-an-ecosystem>What makes up a population in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>The members of a species living in a given area at the same time constitute a population. All the populations living and interacting within a particular geographic area make up a biological (or biotic) community. The living organisms in a community together with their nonliving or abiotic environment make up an ecosystem.</p>
