<h2 id=how-many-wombats-live-in-a-burrow>How many wombats live in a burrow?</h2>
<p>Each burrow will have up to 7 entrances, with most having 2 to 3. The group of burrows is usually occupied by 4 to 5 wombats, with 10 being the maximum. For Northern hairy nosed wombats, it’s estimated that an average of 8 animals live in each warren.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-wombats-live-together>How many wombats live together?</h2>
<p>Some wombats are social, while others are loners. For example, the common wombat spends most of its time alone, while the hairy-nosed wombat can live with up to 12 other wombats in its burrow. A group of wombats is called a mob or colony, according toNational Geographic.</p>
<h2 id=do-wombats-live-in-groups>Do wombats live in groups?</h2>
<p>Burrow life Common wombats are solitary and inhabit their own burrows, while other species may be more social and live together in larger burrow groups called colonies.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-a-wombats-territory>How big is a wombats territory?</h2>
<p>Wombats defend home territories centred on their burrows, and they react aggressively to intruders. The common wombat occupies a range of up to 23 ha (57 acres), while the hairy-nosed species have much smaller ranges, of no more than 4 ha (10 acres).</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-wombats-live-for>How long do wombats live for?</h2>
<p>The baby wombat leaves the pouch at about five months old, and can care for itself at seven months. Wombats can live up to 26 years in the wild.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-of-an-area-does-a-wombat-live-in>How big of an area does a wombat live in?</h2>
<p>Wombats will often build more than 1 burrow within their home range of 5 to 25 hectares. Wombats are mostly solitary animals, but overlapping home ranges can occasionally result in a number of wombats using the same burrow.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-a-wombat-to-dig-a-hole>How long does it take a wombat to dig a hole?</h2>
<p>These burrows may be later expanded to full-sized burrows with multiple sleeping chambers, side tunnels, and additional entrances. In one study it was found that a wombat would dig with a single front paw for about 5 minutes, and then switch to the other paw. A wombat will use its incisors to cut through underground obstructions such as roots.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-bare-nosed-wombats-live-in-tasmania>Where do bare nosed wombats live in Tasmania?</h2>
<p>In a study of Bare-nosed wombats in Tasmania, a colony with 17 burrow entrances was discovered. Bare-nosed wombat burrows are most often located on the slopes or banks above streams and ravines in well-drained soil. They can also be located on the sides of hills. The burrow’s entrance is usually near a tree or a large rock.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-does-a-northern-hairy-nosed-wombat-burrow-get>How big does a northern hairy nosed wombat burrow get?</h2>
<p>Northern Hairy-nosed wombat burrows are often close to trees. The trees provide shade, and the roots help to support the burrow in the soft sandy soil. The burrows occur in groups of up to 20 over an area of a few hectares (about 5 acres). Each burrow will have up to 7 entrances, with most having 2 to 3.</p>
