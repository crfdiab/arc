<h2 id=when-did-europeans-settle-in-vermont>When did Europeans settle in Vermont?</h2>
<p>In 1609, French explorer Samuel de Champlain was the first European to set foot in Vermont.</p>
<h2 id=who-settled-vermont>Who settled Vermont?</h2>
<p>Vermont was initially settled in the early 18th century by both the British and French,and conflicts between the two nations continued until the French defeat in the French and Indian War, after which the land was ceded to England.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-french-and-british-settle-in-vermont>Did the French and British settle in Vermont?</h2>
<p>France claimed Vermont as part of New France, and erected Fort Sainte Anne on Isle La Motte in 1666 as part of their fortification of Lake Champlain. This was the first European settlement in Vermont and the site of the first Roman Catholic mass.</p>
<h2 id=what-historical-events-happened-in-vermont>What historical events happened in Vermont?</h2>
<p>Important Dates, Events, and Milestones in Vermont History</p>
<ul>
<li>1535 – French explorer Jacques Cartier is first European to see what is now Vermont.</li>
<li>1609 – Samuel de Champlain discovers Lake Champlain.</li>
<li>1666 – Fort Ste.</li>
<li>1690 – Small British fort built at Chimney Point.</li>
<li>1724 – British build Fort Dummer at Dummerston.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-indian-tribes-lived-in-vermont>What Indian tribes lived in Vermont?</h2>
<p>The most prominent early indigenous tribes in Vermont were the Abénaki and Mahican. The western Abénaki were composed of subdivisions including Sokoki, Missisquoi, and Cowasuck. Most of the indigenous tribes have disappeared from Vermont through warfare, disease, or migration.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-abenaki-tribe-now>Where is the Abenaki tribe now?</h2>
<p>After European colonists arrived, many Abenakis fled to Canada or moved in with neighboring tribes. Today, Abenaki people live on two reservations in Quebec and scattered around New England.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-indian-reservations-in-vermont>Are there Indian reservations in Vermont?</h2>
<p>There are no federally recognized Indian tribes in Vermont today. Most tribes that once were native to Vermont ended up on reservations in Canada.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-european-settlement-in-vermont>What was the first European settlement in Vermont?</h2>
<h2 id=why-did-people-come-to-vermont-from-new-england>Why did people come to Vermont from New England?</h2>
<p>Vermont history is truly one of migration. Its history shows it ballooning with people eager to start a new life beyond the regimented ways in old New England. As soon as the balloon was filled, it was deflated with its people pushing further into the new frontier. They came to Vermont for many reasons, and they left her for the very same ones!</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-first-people-to-live-in-vermont>Who are the first people to live in Vermont?</h2>
<p>Traveling south from Canada, French colonists were the earliest European immigrants to the land. Their role in the area’s early development is reflected in many of Vermont’s place names, such as Montpelier, Calais, and Lake Champlain. Native Americans, primarily from the Abenaki tribe, have lived in Vermont for 10,000 years.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-french-canadians-move-to-vermont>When did the French Canadians move to Vermont?</h2>
<p>The irony here is that the city is no bigger now than it was 200 years ago. The majority of Vermont towns, in fact, peaked in population between 1810 and 1830. French Canadians started moving south from Eastern Townships of Quebec, then called Canada East or Lower Canada. Their numbers swelled between 1808 and 1820.</p>
