<h2 id=who-discovered-tobacco-would-grow-in-virginia>Who discovered tobacco would grow in Virginia?</h2>
<p>John Rolfe<br>
Known among his peers as “an ardent smoker,” John Rolfe introduced the tobacco plant to the Virginia colony. This plant became the cornerstone of the Virginia economy.</p>
<h2 id=who-brought-the-cash-crop-to-virginia-colony>Who brought the cash crop to Virginia Colony?</h2>
<p>In other words, consumers were waiting! It didn’t take the colonists long to realize that economic specialization would be the way to go, and tobacco became the cash crop for the colony. In 1616, John Rolfe visited England with his indigenous wife Rebecca (Pocahontas) where she was introduced to English royalty.</p>
<h2 id=who-helped-develop-tobacco-as-a-cash-crop>Who helped develop tobacco as a cash crop?</h2>
<p>John Rolfe helped develop tobacco as a cash crop.</p>
<h2 id=did-john-smith-introduced-tobacco-as-a-cash-crop>Did John Smith introduced tobacco as a cash crop?</h2>
<p>Who were the men who caused Jamestown to be successful? John Smith saved the colony from starvation. He told colonists that they must work in order to eat. John Rolfe had the colony plant and harvest tobacco, which became a cash crop and was sold to Europe.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-they-call-tobacco-in-virginia>What did they call tobacco in Virginia?</h2>
<p>The tobacco that the first English settlers encountered in Virginia—the Virginia Indians’ Nicotiana rustica—tasted dark and bitter to the English palate; it was John Rolfe who in 1612 obtained Spanish seeds, or Nicotiana tabacum, from the Orinoco River valley—seeds that, when planted in the relatively rich bottomland …</p>
<h2 id=does-virginia-still-grow-tobacco>Does Virginia still grow tobacco?</h2>
<p>Tobacco has been grown in nearly every Virginia county. Today the process of growing tobacco is still labor-intensive, but profits from several acres of tobacco can exceed the profits from many more acres planted in corn or soybeans.</p>
<h2 id=is-tobacco-still-a-cash-crop>Is tobacco still a cash crop?</h2>
<p>Tobacco supply remains a pressing challenge to tobacco control. Tobacco remains a dominant cash crop in many low- and middle-income countries, despite the evidence suggesting that it is not as profitable as industry claims and is harmful to health and the environment.</p>
<h2 id=which-year-was-more-than-100000000-pounds-of-tobacco-shipped-from-virginia>Which year was more than 100000000 pounds of tobacco shipped from Virginia?</h2>
<p>Hogshead. For shipment, dried tobacco leaves were packed in large wooden barrels called hogsheads. In 1775, Virginia and Maryland exported more than 100 million pounds of the plant. Worth some $4,000,000, tobacco made up more than 75 percent of the total value of all exports from these colonies.</p>
<h2 id=which-colony-was-the-most-successful>Which colony was the most successful?</h2>
<p>Jamestown, founded in 1607, was the first successful permanent English settlement in what would become the United States. The settlement thrived for nearly 100 years as the capital of the Virginia colony; it was abandoned after the capital moved to Williamsburg in 1699.</p>
<h2 id=what-year-was-20000000-pounds-of-tobacco-shipped-from-virginia>What year was 20000000 pounds of tobacco shipped from Virginia?</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, Rolfe believed that “no doubt but after a little more tryall and expense in the curing thereof, it will compare with the best in the West Indies.” He was proved correct in 1617, when 20,000 pounds of Virginia tobacco were shipped to England, and in 1618, when that amount doubled.</p>
<h2 id=is-virginia-famous-for-tobacco>Is Virginia famous for tobacco?</h2>
<p>Tobacco has been grown in nearly every Virginia county. Tobacco culture has evolved over the centuries, and has become an essential element of what makes Virginia unique.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-tobacco-become-a-cash-crop-for-the-colonists>How did tobacco become a cash crop for the colonists?</h2>
<p>It didn’t take the colonists long to realize that economic specialization would be the way to go, and tobacco became a cash crop for the colony. In spite of the popularity of “the weed” in London, John Rolfe probably knew better than to smoke a pipe in front of King James I as it was well-known that the king was vehemently opposed to tobacco.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-successful-cash-crop-in-colonial-virginia>What was the most successful cash crop in colonial Virginia?</h2>
<p>Tobacco was colonial Virginia ‘s most successful cash crop.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-grow-tobacco-in-virginia>Who was the first person to grow tobacco in Virginia?</h2>
<p>Tobacco is not native to Virginia, but it was being grown in North America by Native American farmers 4,000 years before Jamestown was settled. 1 John Rolfe is credited with importing the seeds of a different species, Nicotiana tabacum, perhaps via a smuggler who obtained the seeds on a Caribbean island controlled by the Spanish.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-no-tobacco-in-the-virginia-colonies>Why was there no tobacco in the Virginia colonies?</h2>
<p>Because the Virginia and Bermuda colonies’ economies were affected by the high duty, James in 1624 instead created a royal monopoly. No tobacco could be imported except from Virginia, and a royal license that cost 15 pounds per year was required to sell it.</p>
