<p>18 March 1965<br>
On 18 March 1965 Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov became the first person to leave a space capsule and, tethered to it, float freely in orbit – to space-walk.</p>
<h2 id=who-first-walked-in-space>Who first walked in space?</h2>
<p>cosmonaut Aleksei A. Leonov<br>
As a space walker, White had been preceded by Soviet cosmonaut Aleksei A. Leonov, who on March 18, 1965, was the first man ever to walk in space. Implemented at the height of the space race, NASA’s Gemini program was the least famous of the three U.S.-manned space programs conducted during the 1960s.</p>

<p>cosmonaut Alexei Leonov<br>
In March 1965, at the age of 30, Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov made the first spacewalk in history, beating out American rival Ed White on Gemini 4 by almost three months.</p>
<h2 id=what-went-wrong-with-alexei-leonov-free-float-in-space>What went wrong with Alexei Leonov free float in space?</h2>
<p>According to historians Rex Hall and David Shayler, Leonov’s core body temperature jumped 35° in under a half of an hour, pushing his body to the edge of heatstroke. In later interviews, Leonov described his condition inside of the suit as sloshing in sweat.</p>
<h2 id=are-the-astronauts-still-in-space>Are the astronauts still in space?</h2>
<p>There are still seven astronauts on the ISS, including a new crew of four people who arrived on a different SpaceX craft last week on a mission called Crew-2. As the capsule moved off, Mr Hopkins said: “Thanks for your hospitality. We’ll see you back on Earth.”</p>

<p>Kathryn Sullivan<br>
The first American woman in space, Sally Ride, spent seven days aboard the space shuttle Challenger during its STS-7 mission in June 1983. Kathryn Sullivan, who travelled to space the following year, became the first American woman to complete a spacewalk.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-length-of-the-first-space-walk>What was the length of the first space walk?</h2>
<p>The first spacewalk was 10 minutes long. Astronaut Ed White performed the first American spacewalk during the Gemini 4 mission on June 3, 1965. White’s spacewalk lasted 23 minutes. Today, spacewalks are done outside the International Space Station.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-american-spacewalk-take-place>Where did the first American spacewalk take place?</h2>
<p>The spacewalk started at 3:45 p.m. EDT on the third orbit when White opened the hatch and used the hand-held manuevering oxygen-jet gun to push himself out of the capsule. The EVA started over the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii and lasted 23 minutes, ending over the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-do-a-spacewalk>How long does it take to do a spacewalk?</h2>
<p>Today, spacewalks are done outside the International Space Station. Spacewalks usually last between five and eight hours, depending on the job. The world record for the most spacewalks is held by Russian astronaut Anatoly Solovyev, with a total of 16 EVAs and more than 82 hours outside in space.</p>

<p>Sergey S Pozdnyakov, general director of Zvezda, which manufactures the spacesuits for Russia’s cosmonauts, says it would have been difficult to know how Leonov would react next: “The main doubt was the psychological condition of the person who was in outer space.</p>
