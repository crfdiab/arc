<h2 id=is-november-a-good-time-to-go-to-antarctica>Is November a good time to go to Antarctica?</h2>
<p>The best time to travel to Antarctica is during the Antarctic summer from November to March, when you’ll see Antarctica’s wildlife at its busiest and benefit from up to 24 hours of daylight. For the most popular Fly & Cruise trips or those incorporating South Georgia, 18 months ahead isn’t too early.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-weather-like-in-antarctica-in-november>What is the weather like in Antarctica in November?</h2>
<p>Antarctica Weather in November Antarctica in November: 32 degrees Fahrenheit average daytime temperature & 15.5 hours of daylight. South Shetland Islands in November: 26 degrees Fahrenheit average daytime temperature & 18 hours of daylight.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-antarctica-summer-in-november-and-february>Why is Antarctica summer in November and February?</h2>
<p>Because it’s located in the southern hemisphere, Antarctica’s summer is from October to February. During this time, the sun is almost always in the sky. Days rapidly get longer there in summer, until, eventually, the sun doesn’t set at all. This phenomenon is called the Midnight Sun.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-scientists-visit-antarctica-in-december>Why do scientists visit Antarctica in December?</h2>
<p>Answer: December is a popular month for Antarctic travel as the warmer temperatures and increasingly long days breathe life back into the region. Wildlife numbers are increasing and hungry humpback whales start arriving. Look out for the first penguin chicks which start to hatch.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-there-to-do-in-antarctica-in-november>What is there to do in Antarctica in November?</h2>
<p>Beautiful spring wildflowers are in bloom on the subantarctic islands, and albatrosses, petrels and other seabirds can be spotted over the Drake Passage. November also offers the opportunity to travel into the Weddell Sea on an icebreaker and visit remote emperor penguin colonies.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-whales-in-antarctica-in-november>Are there whales in Antarctica in November?</h2>
<p>Right at the start of the season, November is an excellent month for your Antarctic expedition. As the continent emerges from its long dark winter, springtime brings with it a surge of life. Minke, southern right whales and humpbacks return to Antarctic waters to feed.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-temperature-in-antarctica-in-november>What is the average temperature in Antarctica in November?</h2>
<p>Antarctic Travel in November: FAQs Average temperatures: Antarctic Peninsula: 28 degrees F ( -2 degrees C) South Georgia: 41 degrees F ( 5 degrees C) The Falklands: 46 degrees F (8 degrees C)</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-you-work-in-antarctica>How long do you work in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>But then again, there are some positions for 3-6 months going as well as the longer contracts. Scientists and support workers combine to enable Antarctic science, here at the South Pole, a major project drilling deep into the ice to deploy neutrino detectors.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-go-to-antarctica>When is the best time to go to Antarctica?</h2>
<p>When March comes around, it’s the end of the tourist season in Antarctica, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not a good time to travel here. The weather is a lot colder than in the previous summer months, and the days are starting to get shorter too.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-see-in-antarctica-in-the-month-of-february>What to see in Antarctica in the month of February?</h2>
<p>You’ll see enormous Blue Whales, packs of Orcas hunting, Minke Whales cruising through the waters and many more species too. Towards the end of February, the weather begins to get much colder, but for most of the month, it’s a great time to be in Antarctica.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-winter-start-and-end-in-antarctica>When does the winter start and end in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Since Antarctica is situated in the southern hemisphere, winter is from May to October, and summer is from November to April. Antarctica is actually a desert! That might be surprising to a lot of people, because when we think of deserts we think of hot, dry, large sand surfaces.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-travel-to-antarctica-from-new-zealand>Is it possible to travel to Antarctica from New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Even though there are far fewer opportunities for normal passengers to travel to Antarctica from New Zealand or Australia, it is occasionally possible. The most popular departure port in New Zealand is Invercargill, and in Australis it is Hobart. But these trips require much more time to complete.</p>
