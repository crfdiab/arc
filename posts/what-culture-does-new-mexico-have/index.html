<h2 id=what-culture-does-new-mexico-have>What culture does New Mexico have?</h2>
<p>New Mexico has more Native Americans and a higher percentage of Hispanics than any other state. The Pueblo, Spanish and Anglo cultures are the the three major cultural groups of the area.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-culture-in-albuquerque>What is the culture in Albuquerque?</h2>
<p>Albuquerque is home to more than the Native American, Hispanic and Latino cultures for which New Mexico is well known. Our multicultural city includes African American, Asian, Middle Eastern and many other diverse communities, creating a unique and modern Southwestern blend.</p>
<h2 id=what-state-is-hotter-arizona-or-nm>What state is hotter Arizona or nm?</h2>
<p>New Mexico has a higher altitude than Arizona. Temperatures drop about 4 degrees F for every 1000 feet in altitude. Santa Fe is at 7000 feet. Phoenix, AZ is at 1000 feet, that alone accounts for more than a 20 degree difference.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-culture-does-new-mexico-have>What kind of culture does New Mexico have?</h2>
<p>Anglos are actually a minority here, but there is little overt animosity between the ethnic groups as many have intermarried over the years. New Mexico is certainly one of America’s most rugged and most underdeveloped states, but its nature beauty and fascinating culture make up for any deficiency in modern amenities.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-culture-do-people-in-mexico-have>What kind of culture do people in Mexico have?</h2>
<p>Mexico ’s culture is rich, colourful and vibrant, influenced by its ancient civilisations such as the Aztec and Maya as well as European colonisation. It is unique and probably one of the most fascinating cultures in the world. The traditions and customs of the Mexican people are varied and diverse.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-different-cultures-of-north-america>Where are the different cultures of North America?</h2>
<p>Most scholars break North America—excluding present-day Mexico—into 10 separate culture areas: the Arctic, the Subarctic, the Northeast, the Southeast, the Plains, the Southwest, the Great Basin, California, the Northwest Coast and the Plateau.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-native-american-culture-still-alive-in-new-mexico>Is the Native American culture still alive in New Mexico?</h2>
<p>Evidence of their settlement is the state’s top cultural attractions like Bandelier National Monument and the Gila Cliff Dwellings. In fact, the Native American culture is still alive and well with 11 active pueblos scattered around the state.</p>
