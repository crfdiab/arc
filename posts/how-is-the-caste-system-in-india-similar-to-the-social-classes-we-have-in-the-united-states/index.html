<h2 id=how-is-the-caste-system-in-india-similar-to-the-social-classes-we-have-in-the-united-states>How is the caste system in India similar to the social classes we have in the United States?</h2>
<p>What are the similarities and differences between the caste system in India and the class system of the contemporary United States? The caste system in India and the class system in the United States are both based on wealth levels and are set up to favor those of higher class, or those with greater wealth.</p>
<h2 id=what-a-caste-system-is-and-how-it-is-similar-or-different-from-americas-social-class-structure>What a caste system is and how it is similar or different from America’s social class structure?</h2>
<p>While castes are perceived as hereditary groups with a fixed ritual status, social classes are defined in terms of the relations of production. A social class is a category of people who have a similar socio-economic status in relation to other classes in the society.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-caste-system-differ-from-a-class-system>How does a caste system differ from a class system?</h2>
<p>In a class system, a person can work hard and have little education and still be in middle or upper class, whereas in a caste system that would not be possible. In a class system, low status consistency correlates with having more choices and opportunities.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-caste-system-in-india-different-from-other-societies>How is caste system in India different from other societies?</h2>
<p>In India the caste system is different from other societies as in India hereditary occupational division was sanctioned by rituals. Caste system was based on exclusion of and discrimination against the ‘outcaste’ groups.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-primary-difference-between-a-caste-system-and-slavery>What is the primary difference between a caste system and slavery?</h2>
<p>Class systems contain a certain degree of social mobility, unlike in caste systems, where one’s place in society is fixed. Finally, with slavery, people are reduced to the status of property, entirely beholden to the will of another.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-class-system-open-or-closed>Is the class system open or closed?</h2>
<p>Unlike caste systems, class systems are open. People are free to gain a different level of education or employment than their parents. They can also socialize with and marry members of other classes, which allows people to move from one class to another. In a class system, occupation is not fixed at birth.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-caste-system-in-india-different-from-the-one-in-america>How is the caste system in India different from the one in America?</h2>
<p>My experience suggests perceptions of the caste system among Indians and of racism among Americans have two key differences, one of degree and the other of kind. The one of degree is longevity. Thousands of years older, India’s caste system has had that much more time to get thoroughly marinated in people’s psyche.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-oldest-caste-system-in-the-world>Which is the oldest caste system in the world?</h2>
<p>India’s caste system is among the world’s oldest forms of social stratification surviving to this day The system bestowed many privileges on the upper castes while sanctioning repression of the lower castes by privileged groups.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-some-famous-people-from-indias-caste-system>Who are some famous people from India’s caste system?</h2>
<p>As a result, some Dalits have made it to leading positions, such as BR Ambedkar, who wrote the Indian constitution, and KR Narayanan, who was elected president in 1997. Inequalties under the system still exist in modern India despite these measures, which have even served to reinforce the divisions to some extent.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-four-main-castes-in-hinduism>What are the four main castes in Hinduism?</h2>
<p>The caste system divides Hindus into four main categories – Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and the Shudras.</p>
