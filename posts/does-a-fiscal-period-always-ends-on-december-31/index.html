<p>A panel set up by the NITI Aayog in July 2016, recommended starting the next fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December after the end of the current five-year plan. On 4 May 2017, Madhya Pradesh announced that it would move to a January–December financial year, becoming the first Indian state to do so.</p>

<p>This means that the financial year stretches over two successive years. However, there is one fundamental difference. The fiscal year for the Centre begins on April 1 in ‘T’ (first year) and ends on March 31 in ‘T+1’ (second year). The fiscal year for the RBI, however, starts on July 1 in the first year and finishes on June 30 in the next year.</p>
