<h2 id=how-can-i-become-a-trucker-at-18>How can I become a trucker at 18?</h2>
<p>To begin pursuing your California Commercial Driver’s License (CDL), you will need to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Possess a high school diploma or GED.</li>
<li>Preserve a good driving record.</li>
<li>Have a Class D license for at least 1 year and in good standing.</li>
<li>Be at least 18 years old to drive in-state, 21 to drive state-to-state.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=can-you-drive-semi-trucks-at-18>Can you drive semi trucks at 18?</h2>
<p>For starters, 18 is the minimum age to receive a commercial driver’s license. You can drive a semi, deliver freight and earn a great living, but there are things you can’t do until you’re 21. Interstate trucking is completely off limits. The FMCSA set a minimum age of 21 for hazmat endorsements.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-drive-a-18-wheeler-in-texas>How old do you have to be to drive a 18 wheeler in Texas?</h2>
<p>21-years-old<br>
Texas Laws Semi-truck drivers must pass a drug test before they are hired. They are also randomly drug tested as preventative measure. Semi-truck drivers must be 21-years-old to operate the truck or receive a commercial license.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-become-a-truck-driver-in-texas>How long does it take to become a truck driver in Texas?</h2>
<p>Roadmaster’s Class A CDL Training Program at the Dallas and San Antonio facilities takes approximately 4 weeks and includes hands-on training driving a truck and classroom instruction. Individuals with zero experience should complete a minimum of 160 hours of training.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-drive-trucks-at-19>Can you drive trucks at 19?</h2>
<p>The federal government currently requires commercial truck drivers to be at least 21 to drive a large truck across state lines. But a Department of Transportation pilot program will soon allow some drivers as young as 18 to drive cross-country for private trucking companies.</p>
<h2 id=what-age-do-truck-drivers-retire>What age do truck drivers retire?</h2>
<p>Another major contributor to the driver shortage is an aging workforce. The average age of a driver is 55. With an average retirement age of 62, that means today’s truckers are leaving the workforce in droves, and it’s only expected to get worse.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-do-truckers-make-in-texas>How much do truckers make in Texas?</h2>
<p>The average salary for a truck driver in Texas is around $45,260 per year.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-the-oldest-truck-driver>How old is the oldest truck driver?</h2>
<p>Karl Schabhüser, nicknamed “Shabbi” by his family and friends, obtained his driving licence for a passenger car, motorcycle and truck in 1951. He travelled a total of 7.3 million kilometres by truck over the years of his career as a driver. Today, Karl is 93 years old and has just renewed his truck driving licence.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-drive-a-truck-in-texas>How old do you have to be to drive a truck in Texas?</h2>
<p>Texas: In Texas, you must be 18 years old to drive intrastate, and 21 years old to drive across state lines. You must provide proof of state residency, your current driver’s license, social security, and proof of insurance.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-drive-a-semi-truck>How old do you have to be to drive a semi truck?</h2>
<p>While there are some potential laws that would allow 18 year olds to drive semis, the current law stands that you must be 21 years old. Currently, 18 year olds can drive in most states so long as they do not cross state borders, but the minimum hiring age for the majority of trucking companies is 21 or older.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-be-an-armored-truck-driver>How old do you have to be to be an armored truck driver?</h2>
<p>According to securityguardlicense.org, armored truck drivers are usually at least 21 years old; however, states may set lower minimum age requirements. Prior security or driving experience varied from entry-level to three years.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-drive-a-truck-in-delaware>How old do you have to be to drive a truck in Delaware?</h2>
<p>Delaware: To drive intrastate in Delaware, you have to be at least 18 years old and have held a driver’s license for a minimum of two years. If you are 21 or older, you are permitted to drive interstate, or across state lines.</p>
