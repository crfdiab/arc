<h2 id=can-humans-live-in-greenland>Can humans live in Greenland?</h2>
<p>How many people live in Greenland? You will find one of the world’s smallest populations in Greenland. Only about 56,500 people live here and most residents were born in Greenland. About 11% of the population comes from Denmark and other countries.</p>
<h2 id=is-greenland-habitable>Is Greenland habitable?</h2>
<p>With a population of 56,081 (2020), it is the least densely populated region in the world. Greenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by Arctic peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada.</p>
<h2 id=how-people-in-greenland-survive-despite-of-its-extreme-cold-temperature>How people in Greenland survive despite of it’s extreme cold temperature?</h2>
<p>Despite harsh living conditions, the people of Greenland have adapted their lives to the local conditions and are used to temperatures as low as -30°C in winter. As far as transport is concerned, the inhabitants move around according to the season: by boat during, or during the winter by plane or helicopter.</p>
<h2 id=whats-it-like-to-live-in-greenland>What’s it like to live in Greenland?</h2>
<p>It’s harsh and isolated, but we Greenlanders love living in this magnificent nature and we want to keep it as pure as possible. Summer is the season where everything comes to life; plants, bushes, flowers and animals are everywhere. People go sailing, hiking, or camping.</p>
<h2 id=is-greenland-colder-than-canada>Is Greenland colder than Canada?</h2>
<p>The rest of the world’s coldest places are at the north end of the planet. The second coldest place in the world also sits at the top of a massive ice cap, this time in Greenland. For the coldest places located on exposed dirt, northern Canada and eastern Siberia top the list.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-warmest-it-gets-in-greenland>What’s the warmest it gets in Greenland?</h2>
<p>Greenland soars to its highest temperature ever recorded, almost 80 degrees F.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-it-like-to-live-in-greenland>What is it like to live in Greenland?</h2>
<p>Today, I actually appreciate the experience of Greenland, not so much P-mountain, but the train trip and life on the ice cap. In a way, the experience at Site 2 could be someday a way of life for humans on another planet. Originally Answered: What is it like to live in Greenland ? Greenland is a large island with a small population.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-weather-affect-life-in-greenland>How does the weather affect life in Greenland?</h2>
<p>We do naturally use time in Greenland, it’s just not the most important factor in planning your days and weeks – the Arctic weather is. In Greenland, we have no roads between the towns and settlements; all traffic is by small planes, helicopters or boats, and it’s not unusual to be stranded for days or weeks because of bad weather.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-people-live-in-antarctica-and-greenland>How do people live in Antarctica and Greenland?</h2>
<p>Every human down there has to be supplied externally: ships and planes fly all supplies, fuel, and food and other things necessary for survival. A number of people who study Antarctic fish eat a few of their catch. Water is melted from snow and ice using heat from fuel.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-population-of-greenland-in-the-world>What’s the population of Greenland in the world?</h2>
<p>You will find one of the world’s smallest populations in Greenland. Only about 56,500 people live here and most residents were born in Greenland. About 11% of the population comes from Denmark and other countries. The population growth is stagnant.</p>
