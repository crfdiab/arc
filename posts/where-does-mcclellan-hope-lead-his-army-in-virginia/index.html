<p>On January 12, 1862, McClellan revealed his intentions to transport the Army of the Potomac by ship to Urbanna, Virginia, on the Rappahannock River, outflanking the Confederate forces near Washington, and proceeding 50 miles (80 km) overland to capture Richmond.</p>

<p>The Peninsula (or Peninsular) Campaign was a major Union offensive against the Confederate capital of Richmond led by Major General George B. McClellan in the spring and summer of 1862, during the American Civil War.</p>

<p>Virginia Peninsula<br>
Peninsula Campaign Lincoln preferred an overland campaign toward Richmond, but McClellan proposed an amphibious maneuver in which the Union Army would land on the Virginia Peninsula, effectively circumventing the rebels under General Joseph E. Johnston.</p>
<h2 id=who-leads-the-army-of-northern-virginia>Who leads the Army of Northern Virginia?</h2>
<p>Robert E. Lee<br>
The Army of Northern Virginia was the most successful Confederate army during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With Robert E. Lee at its head, Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson commanding one of its corps, and J. E. B.</p>
<h2 id=who-led-the-army-of-northern-virginia-for-most-of-the-civil-war>Who led the Army of Northern Virginia for most of the Civil War?</h2>
<p>Gen. William N. Pendleton for most of the war. During the Seven Days Battles, Lee had eleven separate divisions under his command.</p>
<h2 id=what-battle-had-the-bloodiest-day-of-the-war>What battle had the bloodiest day of the war?</h2>
<p>Battle Of Antietam<br>
Battle Of Antietam Summary: The Battle of Antietam, a.k.a. Battle of Sharpsburg, resulted in not only the bloodiest day of the American Civil War, but the bloodiest single day in all of American history.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-general-mcclellans-first-campaign-in-the-civil-war>What was General McClellan’s first campaign in the Civil War?</h2>
<p>McClellan’s first major campaign was an attempt to take Richmond, Virginia. It called for the Army of the Potomac to travel by sea to the Virginia Peninsula, then advance against Richmond from the east. McClellan viewed Richmond as a key strategic target.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-mcclellan-do-in-the-peninsula-campaign>What did McClellan do in the Peninsula Campaign?</h2>
<p>McClellan organized and led the Union army in the Peninsula Campaign in southeastern Virginia from March through July 1862. It was the first large-scale offensive in the Eastern Theater.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-most-famous-general-of-the-civil-war>Who was the most famous general of the Civil War?</h2>
<p>However, another general, George B. McClellan, arguably had just as much influence on the course of the war as did Grant and Lee, and yet few know who McClellan was or what he did. George McClellan built the most famous Union army of the war, the Army of the Potomac, and led the army to victory at the Battle of Antietam.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-general-mcclellan-when-he-became-general>How old was General McClellan when he became general?</h2>
<p>After the dismal Union defeat at First Manassas on July 21, 1861, McClellan was called to Washington to take over Union forces in the East. On November 1, his meteoric rise continued when, at the age of 34, he was made General-in-Chief of all Union forces. Upon taking this position, he was heard to proclaim, ‘I can do it all’.</p>
