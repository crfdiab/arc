<h2 id=what-are-the-main-crops-grown-in-scotland>What are the main crops grown in Scotland?</h2>
<p>Crops grown in Scotland include:</p>
<ul>
<li>spring barley – the main crop.</li>
<li>winter wheat and winter barley.</li>
<li>oilseed rape, potatoes and other root crops – to a lesser extent.</li>
<li>soft fruit such as strawberries, raspberries and blackcurrants – grown mainly in Tayside and Fife.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-much-of-scotland-is-farmland>How much of Scotland is farmland?</h2>
<p>This has been caused by the lower profitability of livestock farms, together with an over-supply. But why is there such a demand for arable land? A very small proportion of Scotland’s total land mass is classified as arable – circa 10% based on Scottish Government figures.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-farms-are-there-in-scotland>How many farms are there in Scotland?</h2>
<p>Chart 1: Agricultural land use, 2017 There were 51,356 agricultural holdings, with the total area equating to 74 per cent of Scotland’s total land area. There was also a further 584,062 hectares of common grazing not included in these census results.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-most-farms-in-scotland>Where are the most farms in Scotland?</h2>
<p>Larger cereal farms are concentrated in the east. Beef farming takes place throughout Scotland, but is particularly common in the south west. This area also has the bulk of the dairy industry.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-does-the-scottish-farming-industry-make>How much money does the Scottish farming industry make?</h2>
<p>Scottish Farming Some 80% of Scotland’s land mass is under agricultural production, making the industry the single biggest determinant of the landscape we see around us. Scotland’s farmers, crofters and growers produce output worth around £2.9 billion a year, and are responsible for much of Scotland’s £5 billion food and drink exports.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-agriculture-start-to-take-place-in-scotland>When did agriculture start to take place in Scotland?</h2>
<p>Agriculture in Scotland. Agriculture in Scotland includes all land use for arable, horticultural or pastoral activity in Scotland, or around its coasts. The first permanent settlements and farming date from the Neolithic period, from around 6,000 years ago.</p>
