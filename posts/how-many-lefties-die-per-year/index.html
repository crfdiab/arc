<h2 id=how-many-lefties-die-per-year>How many lefties die per year?</h2>
<p>More than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year around the world from using equipment meant for right-handed people.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-being-left-handed-become-bad>When did being left-handed become bad?</h2>
<p>Left-handedness has been discouraged as recently as the mid-20th century. At times, physical restraints have been used, such as tying a child’s left hand behind their back.</p>
<h2 id=do-left-handers-crash-more>Do left handers crash more?</h2>
<p>Left-handed people appear to be more accident-prone than right-handers and are nearly twice as likely to suffer accident-related injuries, a new study showed last week.</p>
<h2 id=do-lefties-have-a-higher-iq>Do lefties have a higher IQ?</h2>
<p>While there are curious differences between lefties and righties, a higher intelligence level probably isn’t one of them. Many studies show mixed results when examining this complicated link, leading researchers to conclude that left-handed people are no smarter than their right-handed counterparts.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-lefties-good-at>What are lefties good at?</h2>
<p>Left-handed people are said to be good at complex reasoning, resulting in a high number of lefty Noble Prize winners, writers, artists, musicians, architects and mathematicians. According to research published in the American Journal of Psychology, lefties appear to be better at divergent thinking.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-more-likely-to-die-left-handed-or-right-handed>Who is more likely to die left handed or right handed?</h2>
<p>Left-handed people, on average, die younger than right-handed people.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-left-handed-people-start-to-die>When did left handed people start to die?</h2>
<p>This means that taking at a single cohort of individuals who died in the year 1990 would be biased by the fact that people who identified as left handers were, statistically speaking, a younger group of people.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-some-famous-lefties-in-the-world>Who are some famous lefties in the world?</h2>
<p>Scientists have found that a lefty is more likely to suffer from stuttering disabilities and dyslexia. Tom Cruise, President Barrack Obama, Paul McCartney, Ross Kemp and Spike Lee are well-known lefties. With that in mind, did you know that lefties are twice as likely to be a man.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-right-handed-people-live-on-average>How long do right handed people live on average?</h2>
<p>There’s an often-quoted statistic that right-handed people live on average nine years longer than left-handed people. As the daughter of two left-handed parents, and the sister of a left-handed…</p>
