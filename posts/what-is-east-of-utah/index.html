<h2 id=what-is-east-of-utah>What is east of Utah?</h2>
<p>The state lies in the heart of the West and is bounded by Idaho to the north, Wyoming to the northeast, Colorado to the east, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. At Four Corners, in the southeast, Utah meets Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona at right angles, the only such meeting of states in the country.</p>
<h2 id=is-utah-on-the-east-coast>Is Utah on the East Coast?</h2>
<p>The West Coast or Pacific Coast is the coastline along which the continental Western United States meets the North Pacific Ocean. The other states are : Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico & Utah. Utah covers an area of 84,899 sq mi (219,890 km2).</p>
<h2 id=what-part-of-utah-was-underwater>What part of Utah was underwater?</h2>
<p>One-third of Utah was underwater until relatively recently. Around 15,000 years ago, Lake Bonneville, of which the Great Salt Lake is a remnant, was as big as Lake Michigan and covered a third of present-day Utah.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-utah-have-bad-air-quality>Why does Utah have bad air quality?</h2>
<p>Poor air quality in Utah is due to the mountainous topography which can cause pollutants to build up near the surface (especially during inversions) combined with the prevalence of emissions from gasoline and diesel powered vehicles, especially older models. Utah has had mixed responses to poor air quality.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-utah-located-in-the-united-states>Where is Utah located in the United States?</h2>
<h2 id=where-are-the-lakes-in-the-state-of-utah>Where are the lakes in the state of Utah?</h2>
<p>Utah Lake is a 100,000-acre natural freshwater lake located in the Mountainland Region of north-central Utah. Cities of Provo and Orem are located on the lake’s eastern shore. Snuggled between the Lake Mountains to the west and the Wasatch Mountains to the east, Utah Lake is incredibly scenic and a popular destination for year-round recreation.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-great-salt-lake-in-utah>Where is the Great Salt Lake in Utah?</h2>
<p>The Utah Climate Center provides prediction of the Great Salt Lake’s annual lake level. This forecast uses central tropical Pacific Ocean temperature, watershed precipitation, tree-ring data of 750+ years, and the lake level itself. A railroad line – the Lucin Cutoff – runs across the lake, crossing the southern end of Promontory Peninsula.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-eastern-part-of-utah-covered-in>What was the eastern part of Utah covered in?</h2>
<p>The eastern portion of the state was covered by an inland sea that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic. The costal plain between these two areas advanced and retreated as sediment filled the sea and the basin sank. Coal swamps formed behind barrier islands while dinosaurs continued to rule.</p>
