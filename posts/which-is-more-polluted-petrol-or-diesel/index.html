<h2 id=which-is-more-polluted-petrol-or-diesel>Which is more polluted petrol or diesel?</h2>
<p>On average, diesel vehicles are bigger, heavier and more efficient than petrol vehicles. As a result, according to data from the NGO Transport and Environment, diesel engines in circulation are, on average, polluting more than petrol engines in terms of CO2 emitted over their life cycle.</p>
<h2 id=is-diesel-worse-than-petrol-for-the-environment>Is diesel worse than petrol for the environment?</h2>
<p>While diesel engines are meant to be more efficient than petrol engines, diesel cars have received a tremendous amount of bad press. Volkswagen’s marketing stated that diesel engines emit less carbon dioxide than petrol engines. They painted their vehicles to be environmentally friendly.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-polluted-fuel>What is the most polluted fuel?</h2>
<p>Coal produces more pollution than any other energy source. While coal produces just 44% of U.S. electricity, it accounts for 80% of power plant carbon emissions. Burning coal leads to soot, smog, acid rain, global warming, and carbon emissions.</p>
<h2 id=is-diesel-less-toxic-than-petrol>Is diesel less toxic than petrol?</h2>
<p>Because diesels are more efficient, they do in fact emit less carbon dioxide than gasoline engines. Unlike older diesel engines, the newer ones are equipped with diesel particle filters that trap most of that obnoxious particulate matter. However, the amount of nitrogen oxide emitted from diesels remains a problem.</p>
<h2 id=do-diesels-last-longer-than-petrol>Do diesels last longer than petrol?</h2>
<p>In the past, diesel cars have held on to their value for longer than petrol cars, as diesel engines usually last longer. This means that if you think you might want to sell your car a few years down the line, it’s possible you’ll get a much better resale price for a diesel than a petrol model.</p>
<h2 id=are-diesels-better-than-petrol>Are diesels better than petrol?</h2>
<p>Diesels deliver more power at lower engine revs than their petrol equivalent. This makes diesels feel more suited to longer motorway trips because they’re not working as hard as petrol engines to produce the same performance. This also helps to make diesel cars better suited for towing.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-life-of-a-diesel-engine>What is the average life of a diesel engine?</h2>
<p>What makes diesel engines work so well and last so long? It’s normal for your car’s gasoline engine to run for around 200,000 miles before it needs a serious overhaul, or you need a new vehicle. But diesel engines can continuously run for an impressive 1,000,000-1,500,000 miles before needing any major work.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-more-harmful-a-petrol-engine-or-a-diesel-engine>Which is more harmful a petrol engine or a diesel engine?</h2>
<p>Diesel fuelled engines produce more CO2 per gallon of fuel combustion with additional release of harmful emissions such as NOx and PM. One diesel vehicle causes pollution equivalent to 24 petrol vehicles or 40 CNG vehicles.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-diesel-cars-less-polluting-than-gas-cars>Why are diesel cars less polluting than gas cars?</h2>
<p>Contrary to gas vehicles, diesel vehicles convey lesser CO2 in the surroundings. This is because diesel cars burn up less fuel than the other category. On the other hand, gas engines are small chain compounds.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-dirtier-a-diesel-or-a-petrol-car>Which is dirtier a diesel or a petrol car?</h2>
<p>One diesel vehicle causes pollution equivalent to 24 petrol vehicles or 40 CNG vehicles. Diesel being the dirtier fuel, has more emissions as is depicted by the emission standards currently followed by BS-4 compliant cars.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-petrol-or-diesel-in-india>Which is better petrol or diesel in India?</h2>
<p>A study by TERI and ARAI found that vehicular emissions may contribute as much as 30% of the total air pollution in some cities. With countless vehicles being bought in india every year, facing the choice of petrol car vs. diesel car is inevitable. Pick petrol or electric car instead of diesel.</p>
