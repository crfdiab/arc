<h2 id=what-vegetables-are-native-to-new-zealand>What vegetables are native to New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Indigenous vegetables Examples are pūhā (sowthistle) and an acidic form of spinach (Tetragonia tetragonioides). Māori traditionally consumed parts of native plants such as fern roots and cabbage tree hearts as vegetables, and introduced the kūmara (sweet potato), yam, gourd and taro.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-considered-native-vegetation>What is considered native vegetation?</h2>
<p>Native vegetation includes all trees, shrubs, scrub, understorey plants, groundcover and plants in a wetland that are native to NSW. In some circumstances the definition of native vegetation extends to dead plants.</p>
<h2 id=what-food-is-native-to-new-zealand>What food is native to New Zealand?</h2>
<p>While you’re in New Zealand, seek out a few of the following quintessential Kiwi foods and drinks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crayfish and seafood.</li>
<li>New Zealand lamb.</li>
<li>Hāngī – food cooked under the ground.</li>
<li>Fish and chips.</li>
<li>New Zealand wine, beer and other drinks.</li>
<li>Kiwi summer BBQ.</li>
<li>New Zealand pavlova and fruit salad.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-does-clearing-vegetation-mean>What does clearing vegetation mean?</h2>
<p>Clearing means what it sounds like, removing all vegetation. Grubbing refers to the removal of the roots that remain in the soil after clearing. Stumps are then ground or removed with a root rake or similar machine.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-clear-native-vegetation>Can I clear native vegetation?</h2>
<p>In general native vegetation must not be cleared if it is in a native vegetation area. Clearing without approval in NSW may result in a fine of up to $375,000 for an individual and $1,875,000 for a corporation and in certain cases up to 7 years imprisonment.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-plants-are-found-in-new-zealand>What kind of plants are found in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>80% of our trees, ferns and flowering plants are endemic (found only in New Zealand). About 10–15% of the total land area of New Zealand is covered with native flora, from tall kauri and kohekohe forests to rainforest dominated by rimu, beech, tawa, matai and rata; ferns and flax; dunelands with their spinifex and pingao;</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-native-forests-in-new-zealand>Where are the native forests in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>New Zealand’s forest ecosystems support a diverse array of flora and fauna. Today, indigenous forest is found mainly at higher altitudes; much of what remains in coastal and lowland areas is in small and isolated fragments . Logging and land clearance have completely destroyed much of the country’s native forest and its associated biodiversity.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-are-native-to-new-zealand>How many trees are native to New Zealand?</h2>
<p>80% of our trees, ferns and flowering plants are endemic (found only in New Zealand).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-threats-to-forests-in-new-zealand>What are the threats to forests in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>The greatest threats to native forests come from damage caused by invasive species, the fragmentation of forest habitats, and the lack of intact forest buffers. In pre-human times, New Zealand’s land mass was blanketed by forests.</p>
