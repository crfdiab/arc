<h2 id=is-8-cgpa-good-in-engineering>Is 8 CGPA good in engineering?</h2>
<p>What is a good CGPA in Engineering? Usually, CGPA or CPI of 8 or above is considered good. If the student is planning to study abroad then scoring a little higher will help them with the admission process. CPI to percentage conversion is also possible for those colleges which have cutoffs in percentage.</p>
<h2 id=is-75-a-good-cgpa>Is 7.5 A good CGPA?</h2>
<p>It is hard for US Universities to pick the best students from each college across the world, so above 8.5 CGPA is good enough for getting into Top Ivy League colleges. The point is, 7.5 CGPA by itself means nothing.</p>

<p>The tables below show the basic percentage equivalency for the two scales.</p>
<table><tr><th>Letter Grade</th><th>%</th><th>GPA Number</th></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>70-74</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>B-</td><td>65-69</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>C+</td><td>60-64</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>55-59</td><td>3</td></tr></table>
