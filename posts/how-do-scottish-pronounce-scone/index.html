<h2 id=how-do-scottish-pronounce-scone>How do Scottish pronounce scone?</h2>
<p>A fun survey has revealed that more than three-quarters of Scots agree that ‘scone’ should rhyme with ‘gone’. What makes up the perfect afternoon tea was at the heart of a recent surveying of the UK’s aficionados.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-pronounced-scon-or-scone>Is it pronounced SCON or scone?</h2>
<p>Following etiquette, the correct pronunciation of scone is ‘skon’, to rhyme with ‘gone’, rather than ‘skone’ to rhyme with ‘bone’. The ‘posh’ pronunciation of scone really isn’t so posh after all.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-the-british-pronounce-scone>How do the British pronounce scone?</h2>
<p>In Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England, it’s pronounced to rhyme with ‘gone’. Whereas, in the Midlands and the Republic of Ireland, it rhymes with ‘bone’ – while the rest of the UK seems to mix the two different vocalisations.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-a-scone-called-a-scone>Why is a scone called a scone?</h2>
<p>The name ‘scone’ is thought to have come from the Scottish name for the Stone of Destiny, where Scottish kings were (supposedly) once crowned. Similarly, the scones were cooked in rounds that were then cut into wedges, rather than being shaped into wedges before baking as they are today.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-l-in-almond-pronounced>Is the L in almond pronounced?</h2>
<p>Is it or is it not pronounced? A: The “l” in “almond” was silent until very recently. More recent standard dictionaries say we can now properly pronounce “almond” either with or without the “l” sound.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-queen-eat-scones>Does the queen eat scones?</h2>
<p>The Queen’s former chef has revealed that Her Majesty enjoys her scones with a dollop of cream on top of the jam, reports CornwallLive. According to The Independent, in his book ‘Eating Royally: Recipes and Remembrances from a Palace Kitchen’, Mr McGrady clarifies Her Majesty’s position on the jam or cream first issue.</p>
<h2 id=should-you-cut-or-break-a-scone>Should you cut or break a scone?</h2>
<p>Scoop out clotted cream and jams onto your plate, enough for one scone. Break apart a small bite-sized portion of scone with your hands or if using a knife, cut the scone horizontally. Use a knife to slather on cream and jam onto the broken-off piece of scone. The bite-sized piece of scone should be eaten in 1-2 bites.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-scones-called-in-america>What are scones called in America?</h2>
<p>Scones and biscuits are different things in the USA. We call scones “scones”, just like the British do. Most Americans know the difference between the two. A biscuit (in the USA) is a savory quick bread that is usually round and is served buttered with a meal, or sometimes with gravy.</p>
<h2 id=are-scones-irish-or-scottish>Are scones Irish or Scottish?</h2>
<p>Scones are traditionally connected with Scotland, Ireland and England, but exactly who deserves the honor of invention, no one knows for sure. Scones may well have originated in Scotland. The first known print reference, in 1513, is from a Scottish poet.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-bostonians-say-scallops>How do Bostonians say scallops?</h2>
<p>Re: How do you pronounce “scallop”? Wallop is the way Bostonians say it.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-correct-pronunciation-of-the-word-scone>Which is the correct pronunciation of the word scone?</h2>
<p>There are two possible pronunciations of the word scone: the first rhymes with gone and the second rhymes with tone. In US English the pronunciation rhyming with tone is more common.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-you-rhyme-gone-with-scone-in-england>Where do you Rhyme Gone with Scone in England?</h2>
<p>Those who rhyme it with gone predominate in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England. Those who rhyme with cone dominate in southern Ireland and the Midlands. The rest of the country is a mixture of the two pronunciations.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-more-common-gone-or-scone>Which is more common, gone or scone?</h2>
<p>“It is more a matter of where you grew up. By and large, the pronunciation that rhymes with gone is more common, however.” “Our language continually reshapes itself,” she says. “New words appear. In addition, pronunciations of existing words alter.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-they-say-scone-in-afternoon-tea>Where do they say Scone in afternoon tea?</h2>
<p>According to the survey, afternoon teas in Scotland and Ulster would include scones as in “gone” while folks further south in England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland would be ordering scones in “bone”.</p>
