<h2 id=are-wasps-native-to-new-zealand>Are wasps native to New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Arrival in New Zealand There are no native social wasps in New Zealand – a very unusual situation compared with other parts of the world. However, there are four introduced species of social wasps established: two introduced species of paper wasps (Polistes) and two Vespula species.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-wasps-come-to-new-zealand>How did wasps come to New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Jonathan Carson reports as part of the Wasp Wipeout project. The German invaders arrived in New Zealand at the end of World War II. They were stowaways on a ship carrying aircraft parts from Europe. The first reported sighting of the intruders was at a Hamilton airforce base in 1945.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-wasps-come-from>Where did the wasps come from?</h2>
<p>Wasps first appeared in the fossil record in the Jurassic, and diversified into many surviving superfamilies by the Cretaceous. They are a successful and diverse group of insects with tens of thousands of described species; wasps have spread to all parts of the world except for the polar regions.</p>
<h2 id=are-all-wasps-bad-nz>Are all wasps Bad NZ?</h2>
<p>But in New Zealand that is not all that is bad about wasps; they are non-native introduced species that have detrimental effects on our native wildlife. The combination of nuisance, pain and environmental damage makes wasps many people’s least favourite creatures.</p>
<h2 id=when-should-you-kill-paper-wasps>When should you kill paper wasps?</h2>
<p>Larger nests, or those found later in the season, should be handled cautiously. Never attempt to remove an active wasp nest during the day, when the insects are actively flying in and out of the nest. Wait until evening, when the paper wasps have settled in for the night, to treat or remove any nest.</p>
<h2 id=do-paper-wasps-have-a-queen>Do paper wasps have a queen?</h2>
<p>Spring Queen-ing Paper wasp queens spend winter hibernating in sheltered places and crevices, indoors or out. The queens of this species are the first to emerge in springtime (before hornets and yellowjackets), usually when daytime temperatures reach 50 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-german-wasp-first-found-in-new-zealand>Where was the German wasp first found in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>The German wasp ( Vespula germanica) is native to Europe and northern Africa. It was first found at an air force base near Hamilton, in 1945, and it has been suggested that hibernating queens arrived in New Zealand in crates of aircraft parts from Europe after the Second World War.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-largest-wasp-nest-in-new-zealand>How big is the largest wasp nest in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>German wasp nests are grey. Common wasp nests are brown. The world’s largest recorded wasp nest was discovered at Waimauku (near Auckland). It was 3.75 metres tall and 1.7 metres wide. Although not as much of a problem as German and common wasps, paper wasps have also been introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-species-of-wasps-are-there-in-the-world>How many species of wasps are there in the world?</h2>
<p>But five social species of wasps have been accidentally introduced since the 1940s and are classed as pests (German and common wasps, and three species of paper wasp). How to identify wasps. Introduced wasps are a significant pest which harm our native birds and insects, and are a threat to human health and recreation.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-insects-do-wasps-eat-in-new-zealand>What kind of insects do wasps eat in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Wasps eat a wide range of invertebrates including spiders, caterpillars, ants, bees, and flies. It has also been suggested that wasps may prey on nestling birds. Wasps also collect honeydew.</p>
