<h2 id=why-do-we-need-to-maintain-a-constant-internal-environment>Why do we need to maintain a constant internal environment?</h2>
<p>Maintaining a constant internal environment by providing the cells with what they need to survive (oxygen, nutrients, and removal of waste) is necessary for the well-being of both individual cells and the entire body.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-for-living-things-to-keep-things-constant>Why is it important for living things to keep things constant?</h2>
<p>Maintaining a constant internal environment by providing the cells with what they need to survive (oxygen, nutrients, and removal of waste) is necessary for the well- being of individual cells and of the entire body.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-we-call-the-maintenance-of-the-internal-environment-of-the-body>What do we call the maintenance of the internal environment of the body?</h2>
<p>Homeostasis is the maintenance of a stable internal environment. Homeostasis is a term coined to describe the physical and chemical parameters that an organism must maintain to allow proper functioning of its component cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.</p>
<h2 id=is-maintaining-stable-conditions-inside-the-body>Is maintaining stable conditions inside the body?</h2>
<p>What is maintaining stable conditions inside the body? Homeostasis.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-you-think-it-is-important-to-have-both-negative-and-positive-feedback-loops-in-the-body>Why do you think it is important to have both negative and positive feedback loops in the body?</h2>
<p>A feedback loop is a biological occurrence wherein the output of a system amplifies the system (positive feedback) or inhibits the system (negative feedback). Feedback loops are important because they allow living organisms to maintain homeostasis.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-homeostasis-affect-the-human-body>How does homeostasis affect the human body?</h2>
<p>Homeostasis plays a major role in the proper functioning of the body. These systems maintain the stability of the body by releasing the stimulus when the hormone levels increases or decreases. The stimulus is generated; the cells act accordingly to maintain the proper functioning of the cell.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-medical-term-for-maintenance-of-a-stable-internal-physical-state-of-the-body>What is the medical term for maintenance of a stable internal physical state of the body?</h2>
<p>homeostasis. the maintenance of a constant internal state in a changing environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-blood-flow-in-your-body-when-your-internal-temperature-increases>What happens to blood flow in your body when your internal temperature increases?</h2>
<p>Vasoconstriction: The blood vessels under your skin become narrower. This decreases blood flow to your skin, retaining heat near the warm inner body.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-example-of-a-positive-feedback-loop-in-the-human-body>What is an example of a positive feedback loop in the human body?</h2>
<p>A good example of positive feedback involves the amplification of labor contractions. The contractions are initiated as the baby moves into position, stretching the cervix beyond its normal position. The feedback increases the strength and frequency of the contractions until the baby is born.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-positive-feedback-examples>What are two positive feedback examples?</h2>
<p>Some examples of positive feedback are contractions in child birth and the ripening of fruit; negative feedback examples include the regulation of blood glucose levels and osmoregulation.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-homeostasis-cannot-be-restored>What happens when homeostasis Cannot be restored?</h2>
<p>Many diseases are a result of homeostatic imbalance, an inability of the body to restore a functional, stable internal environment. Aging is a source of homeostatic imbalance as the control mechanisms of the feedback loops lose their efficiency, which can cause heart failure.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-ph-important-to-living-organisms>Why is the pH important to living organisms?</h2>
<p>Living organisms depend on a proper balance of hydrogen and hydroxide ions in order to maintain essential physiological processes. Scientists use pH to express the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. Many organisms have tightly regulated systems to maintain the pH within the required range.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-a-constant-body-temperature>Why do we need a constant body temperature?</h2>
<p>Body temperature must be controlled within a very narrow range so that the body can function properly. In particular, enzymes in a body’s cells must have the correct temperature to be able to catalyse chemical reactions. Temperature control is the process of keeping the body at a constant core body temperature close to 37°C.</p>
<p>Why do we need to maintain a constant internal environment? – OCR 21C. Organisms can only function if their internal conditions are kept within a specific range. This is called homeostasis. The endocrine system secretes hormones for homeostasis to occur.</p>
