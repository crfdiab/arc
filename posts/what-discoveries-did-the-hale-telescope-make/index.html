<h2 id=what-discoveries-did-the-hale-telescope-make>What discoveries did the Hale Telescope make?</h2>
<p>Big vision, big telescopes The vision for the Palomar Observatory is credited to George Ellery Hale, a 19th- and 20th-century astronomer who is known not only for his scientific discoveries — he found out that magnetic fields and sunspots are linked, for example — but also for his business sense.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-hale-telescope-used-for>What is the Hale Telescope used for?</h2>
<p>Dedicated in 1948 and the largest effective telescope in the world until 1993, the 200-inch Hale Telescope is a workhorse of modern astronomy and contributes to a wide range of astronomical research including Solar System studies, the search for extrasolar planets, stellar population and evolution analysis, and the …</p>
<h2 id=what-did-hale-use-instead-in-his-telescope>What did Hale use instead in his telescope?</h2>
<p>Originally, the Hale Telescope was going to use a primary mirror of fused quartz manufactured by General Electric, but instead the primary mirror was cast in 1934 at Corning Glass Works in New York State using Corning’s then new material called Pyrex (borosilicate glass).</p>
<h2 id=why-does-mulder-use-the-name-george-hale>Why does Mulder use the name George Hale?</h2>
<p>Trivia (13) George Hale was the visionary behind the Palomar Observatory in California. Mulder explained this to Scully in the past episode The X-Files: Little Green Men (1994), where he also used it as an alias for his flight to Puerto Rico.</p>
<h2 id=which-telescope-is-being-advertised-as-the-worlds-biggest-eye-on-the-sky>Which telescope is being advertised as the world’s biggest eye on the sky?</h2>
<p>E-ELT<br>
ESO is currently planning a 40-metre-class European Extremely Large optical/near-infrared Telescope, the E-ELT, which will become “the world’s biggest eye on the sky”.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-palomar-telescope-special>Why is the Palomar telescope special?</h2>
<p>It was the largest telescope in the world for 45 years. A 60-inch (1.5m) reflecting telescope is located in the Oscar Mayer Building, and operates fully robotically. The telescope became operational in 1970, and was built to increase sky access for Palomar astronomers.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-george-hale-maine>How old is George Hale Maine?</h2>
<p>At 89, George can’t see himself doing anything else. With more than 60 years of entertaining Maine radio listeners and television audiences, George is a broadcasting legend with a loyal following.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-george-hale-famous-for>What was George Hale famous for?</h2>
<p>The most effective entrepreneur in 20th-century American astronomy, Hale built four observatories and helped create the new discipline of astrophysics. He is known also for his research in solar physics, particularly his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-individual-telescopes-make-up-the-vla>How many individual telescopes make up the VLA?</h2>
<p>The VLA comprises twenty-eight 25-meter radio telescopes (27 of which are operational while one is always rotating through maintenance) deployed in a Y-shaped array and all the equipment, instrumentation, and computing power to function as an interferometer.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-george-ellery-hale-do-for-a-living>What did George Ellery Hale do for a living?</h2>
<p>George Ellery Hale (June 29, 1868 – February 21, 1938) was an American solar astronomer, best known for his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots, and as the leader or key figure in the planning or construction of several world-leading telescopes; namely, the 40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory,…</p>
<h2 id=how-did-george-ellery-hale-get-his-telescope-built>How did George Ellery Hale get his telescope built?</h2>
<p>As he had with Yerkes, Hale pursued a local philanthropist, hardware magnate John D. Hooker, for support. Delayed by the imposing challenge of producing the mirror and then by World War I, the 100-inch reflector finally became operational at Mount Wilson in 1918. Hale had for a third time built the largest telescope in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-tools-did-george-ellery-hale-use>What kind of tools did George Ellery Hale use?</h2>
<p>His tools were those he had used in boyhood—the telescope, the spectroscope, the photographic plate; his working place was the observatory combined with laboratory and shop where astrophysical problems might be solved to discover the physical nature of the universe. In 1886 Hale entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-george-ellery-hale-interested-in-sunspots>Why was George Ellery Hale interested in sunspots?</h2>
<p>Fascinated with the structure of sunspots, Hale was able to show by 1908 that they were magnetically active storms of swirling gas in the solar photosphere.</p>
