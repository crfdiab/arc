<p>Andrew Jackson issued the Specie Circular at the end of his presidency to end reckless land speculation. The Specie Circular demanded that payments for the purchase of public lands were made exclusively in gold or silver. It also dried up credit, leading to the Panic of 1837.</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson’s<br>
Van Buren was elected president in 1836, but he saw financial problems beginning even before he entered the White House. He inherited Andrew Jackson’s financial policies, which contributed to what came to be known as the Panic of 1837.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-causes-and-effects-of-the-panic-of-1837>What were the causes and effects of the Panic of 1837?</h2>
<p>The Panic was followed by a five-year depression, with the failure of banks and record high unemployment levels. Causes of the Panic of 1837 include the economic policies of President Andrew Jackson who ordered the Specie Circular, which required the payments for government lands to be paid in gold or silver.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-most-responsible-for-causing-the-panic-of-1873>What was most responsible for causing the Panic of 1873?</h2>
<p>Railroads were the nation’s largest non-agricultural employer. Banks and other industries were putting their money in railroads. So when the banking firm of Jay Cooke and Company, a firm heavily invested in railroad construction, closed its doors on September 18, 1873, a major economic panic swept the nation.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-panic-of-1837-is-so-important-in-us-history>Why the Panic of 1837 is so important in US history?</h2>
<p>The Panic of 1837 was a financial crisis that had damaging effects on the Ohio and national economies. Following the War of 1812, the United States government recognized the need for a national bank to regulate the printing of currency and the issuance of government bonds.</p>

<p>Lesson Summary. A perfect storm of events contributed to the financial panic of 1837, as well as the resulting depression of 1837 in the United States. President Van Buren faced a depression in England, falling prices in cotton, a poor wheat crop, and inflation that spiraled out of control.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-panic-of-1837-affect-people-in-ohio>How did the Panic of 1837 affect people in Ohio?</h2>
<p>In Ohio, many people lost their entire life savings as banks closed. Stores refused to accept currency in payment of debts, as numerous banks printed unsecured (backed by neither gold nor silver) money. Some Ohioans printed their own money, hoping business owners would accept it.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-panic-of-1819>What was the cause of the Panic of 1819?</h2>
<p>The earlier Panic of 1819 was caused by the bad management of the Second Bank of the United States and had resulted in serious hardship for the people in the two year depression that followed. Andrew Jackson, the ‘man of the people’, had also suffered financially during the Panic of 1819.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-van-buren-respond-to-the-panic-of-1837>How did Van Buren respond to the Panic of 1837?</h2>
<p>Van Buren’s refusal to use government intervention to address the crisis (such as emergency relief and increasing spending on public infrastructure projects to reduce unemployment) according to his opponents, contributed further to the hardship and duration of the depression that followed the panic.</p>
