<h2 id=is-connection-time-the-same-as-layover>Is connection time the same as layover?</h2>
<p>When you only have a very limited time to make your connecting flight, this is called a short layover (or a tight connection). A layover is different from a stopover, which is normally over 24 hours and may allow you enough time to explore the place you’re stopping.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-layover-and-connecting-flight>What is the difference between a layover and connecting flight?</h2>
<p>A layover flight is also called a connecting flight. If you book a layover flight, it means the plane will make a stop en route, with passengers disembarking the flight and changing services. Connecting flights have more than one flight number.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-connecting-and-a-layover>What’s the difference between a connecting and a layover?</h2>
<p>A connecting flight is simply when you get off your flight and head to your next flight to reach the final destination. A layover is the time that you have between one flight and another flight, generally more than an hour. This means you have extra time after any security/customs. As an example, lets say my final destination is NYC (jfk).</p>
<h2 id=how-long-should-i-have-a-layover-between-flights>How long should I have a layover between flights?</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, it’s good to give yourself a buffer of at least one hour for domestic flights and at least two hours between international flights. It’s not always something you can control, however.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-non-stop-flight-and-a-layover>What’s the difference between a non stop flight and a layover?</h2>
<p>While non-stop flights go straight from Point A to Point B, when your flight stops somewhere else en route to your final destination, it’s called a layover. Hi, I’m Scott, founder of Scott’s Cheap Flights.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-call-a-layover-a-stopover>When do you call a layover a stopover?</h2>
<p>Simply put, a layover happens any time you switch planes during your journey. Most people use connection and layover interchangeably. Generally, if your layover is more than four hours, it is considered a stopover. If you’re flying on an international itinerary, a layover lasting more than 24 hours counts as a stopover.</p>
