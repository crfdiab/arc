<h2 id=how-many-hours-do-you-have-to-work-to-get-unemployment-in-kentucky>How many hours do you have to work to get unemployment in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Kentucky requires you to have worked during a minimum of two quarters of the base period in order to qualify for unemployment insurance. Your total base period earnings must be at least 1.5 times your HQW.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-file-unemployment-for-one-day>Can you file unemployment for one day?</h2>
<p>If your hours or pay have been cut, you may still be eligible for partial unemployment compensation; however, most of what you earn will be subtracted from your benefit amount. Unemployment benefits are available to employees who are out of work temporarily, through no fault of their own.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-get-unemployment-for-temporary-jobs>Can you get unemployment for temporary jobs?</h2>
<p>Temporary and seasonal employees may qualify for unemployment benefits at the conclusion of an assignment. State unemployment insurance laws generally do not disqualify an individual based on his or her classification as a temporary or seasonal worker.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-draw-unemployment-in-ky-if-you-work-part-time>Can you draw unemployment in Ky If you work part-time?</h2>
<p>Part-time Work and Unemployment Benefits You may work part-time and still collect unemployment. You may also file a claim when your employer has significantly reduced your wages (through no fault of your own). The state will deduct 80% of your gross pay during the week you earned wages.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hours-can-you-work-and-still-get-partial-unemployment>How many hours can you work and still get partial unemployment?</h2>
<p>Under the new rules, claimants can work up to 7 days per week without losing full unemployment benefits for that week, if they work 30 hours or fewer and earn $504 or less in gross pay excluding earnings from self-employment.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-cycle-of-unemployment>What is a cycle of unemployment?</h2>
<p>What Is Cyclical Unemployment? Cyclical unemployment is the component of overall unemployment that results directly from cycles of economic upturn and downturn. Unemployment typically rises during recessions and declines during economic expansions.</p>
<h2 id=should-i-take-a-temporary-job>Should I take a temporary job?</h2>
<p>A temporary job gives you the ability to grow your network, secure professional references and earn money all at once. Even if the position isn’t something you want to do long term, you can make the most of the opportunity by forging professional relationships that will benefit your career in the long run.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-can-i-make-and-still-get-unemployment-in-ky>How much can I make and still get unemployment in KY?</h2>
<p>If you are eligible to receive unemployment, your weekly benefit rate in Kentucky will be 1.1923% of your total wages during the base period. You will receive a maximum of $415 each week; the minimum amount is $39. You may receive benefits for a maximum of 26 weeks.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-unemployment-in-kentucky>How long does it take to get unemployment in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>The Kentucky Governor’s executive order waives the usual one-week unpaid waiting period, so you can collect unemployment benefits for the first week you are out of work. If you are found to be eligible, the unemployment office processes and issues payments within a few weeks of receiving your claim.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-get-unemployment-if-you-quit-your-job-in-kentucky>Can you get unemployment if you quit your job in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>While every case is different, your Kentucky unemployment benefits eligibility is not likely if you were fired or quit your job. In these cases, you are welcome to apply for Kentucky unemployment benefits, but the claim is likely to be denied.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-eligible-for-unemployment-benefits-in-kentucky>Who is eligible for unemployment benefits in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Kentucky workers who have recently lost their jobs may be eligible for unemployment benefits: payments available to employees who are out of work temporarily, through no fault of their own.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-get-unemployment-if-you-work-less-than-full-time>Can you get unemployment if you work less than full time?</h2>
<p>If you work less than full-time during a calendar week, you can collect partial unemployment benefits for that week as long as your gross earnings are not more than 1.5 times your weekly unemployment rate and all other requirements to receive benefits (you are able to work, available for work and seeking full time employment) are met.</p>
