<h2 id=where-does-the-uk-get-most-of-its-fish-from>Where does the UK get most of its fish from?</h2>
<p>The north Atlantic, and in particular the waters referred to as the EU’s Northern External Waters, has a plentiful stock of cod and haddock supplying the UK’s fish & chip shops….UK cod catches in distant waters (2017)</p>
<table><tr><th>Country</th><th>Tonnes</th></tr><tr><td>Greenland</td><td>1,756</td></tr><tr><td>North Norway</td><td>6,950</td></tr><tr><td>Svalbard</td><td>9,637</td></tr><tr><td>NAFO (Northwest Atlantic)</td><td>1,144</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=where-does-british-haddock-come-from>Where does British haddock come from?</h2>
<p>Haddock in Europe are found in the colder waters of the North Sea, Baltic Sea and the Barents Sea, and off the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-uk-get-its-tuna-from>Where does the UK get its tuna from?</h2>
<p>The Seychelles was the number one supplier of tuna into the UK, exporting 18 thousand metric tons in 2017. In the year prior, Ghana provided a larger share of UK imports than the Seychelles, with approximately 23 thousand tons of tuna.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-fish-we-eat-in-the-uk-come-from>Where does the fish we eat in the UK come from?</h2>
<p>We eat these fish more than any other nation. This is the fish served most often in our fish & chip shops. Most of this comes from the Icelandic, Norwegian and Barents Seas, where around one twelfth of the total is caught by the British trawler Kirkella.</p>
<h2 id=which-countries-buy-uk-fish>Which countries buy UK fish?</h2>
<p>The EU nations that would be most affected by the end of access to UK waters in the analysis were Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, whose fishing fleets catch 35-45% of their fish in UK. Ireland also imports a lot of fish from the UK.</p>
<h2 id=does-uk-import-fish>Does UK import fish?</h2>
<p>In 2018, the United Kingdom (UK) imported around 53.9 thousand metric tons of salmon from the EU28 countries. This quantity was far greater than the total volume of shellfish imported from the EU. With the EU as a trade partner, the UK exported more fish and fish preparations than it imported them with the EU.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-keep-tuna-caught-in-uk>Can you keep tuna caught in UK?</h2>
<p>The reasons for their return to British waters are not clear, but may be driven by conservation efforts and warming waters due to climate change. Tuna fishing is banned in all UK waters. If fisherman catch an Atlantic bluefin tuna by accident, they must release it immediately back into the water.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-eaten-fish-in-uk>What is the most eaten fish in UK?</h2>
<p>Mackerel was the leading fish type landed by UK vessels with over 152 thousand tonnes.</p>
<p>Most of this comes from the Icelandic, Norwegian and Barents Seas, where around one twelfth of the total is caught by the British trawler Kirkella. • 83% said fish & chips has the best claim to be the UK’s national dish (but a quarter of Welsh MPs, named chicken tikka masala!)</p>
<h2 id=how-many-fish-and-chip-shops-are-there-in-the-uk>How many fish and chip shops are there in the UK?</h2>
<p>There are now around 8,500 fish and chip shops * across the UK – that’s eight for every one McDonald’s outlet, making British Fish and Chips the nation’s favourite take-away. British food from the Romans to Sunday roast dinners, fish and chips and the great British curry!</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-fish-stocks-in-the-uk>Are there any fish stocks in the UK?</h2>
<p>Although UK waters are extensive, as the map below shows, the fish stocks which live in our waters are by no means confined to them. Some, like mackerel, make extensive migrations and only pass through our waters for a short period.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-more-british-fish-and-chips-or-mushy-peas>Which is more British fish and chips or mushy peas?</h2>
<p>Fish, chips and mushy peas! There is nothing more British than fish and chips. Freshly cooked, piping hot fish and chips, smothered in salt and soused with vinegar, wrapped in newspaper and eaten out-of-doors on a cold and wintry day – it simply cannot be beaten!</p>
