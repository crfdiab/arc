<h2 id=what-are-some-characteristics-of-african-sculpture>What are some characteristics of African sculpture?</h2>
<p>Traditional or tribal African sculpture typically may be religious or spiritual in nature, be carved from wood, dealing primarily with the human form (and sometimes animal or mythical) and shows a creative spirit and skill that exhibits good balance, craftsmanship, attention to detail and finish and an essence of …</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-characteristics-of-art>What are the characteristics of art?</h2>
<p>The principles of art include: movement, unity, harmony, variety, balance, contrast , proportion and pattern. The elements of art include: texture , form , space , shape, color, value and line . How best to define the term art is a subject of constant contention.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-function-of-african-art>What is the function of African art?</h2>
<p>Traditional African art served a purpose (and does still in some cultures) as an agent of religion, social stability, and social control. Art that has a purpose is not unique to African or other non-Western cultures but occurs in Western ones as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-characteristics-of-a-beautiful-art>What are the characteristics of a beautiful art?</h2>
<p>Common characteristics of good art are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the right amount of details.</li>
<li>the skillful use of light and shadow.</li>
<li>interesting color choices.</li>
<li>a believable and appropriate perspective.</li>
<li>an artistically pleasing composition.</li>
<li>a (high) degree of realism.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-art-is-typical-of-africa>What kind of art is typical of Africa?</h2>
<p>Strong lines, strong colours and strong pattern. African art basically portrays the African society, hence you will see things typical to Africa like its culture and people.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-human-figures-important-in-african-art>Why are human figures important in African art?</h2>
<p>However, by assigning human characteristics to the figure, the artist ensures that his or her subjects are able to identify and thus relate to the subject and the art piece as a whole. Human figures are used to symbolise living and dead and can also be used to convey the idea of a spiritual being.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-characteristics-of-african-architecture>What are the main characteristics of African architecture?</h2>
<p>The architecture of Africa is treated in a separate article; see African architecture. It is difficult to give a useful summary of the main characteristics of the art of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-characteristics-of-pan-african-art>What are the characteristics of Pan-African art?</h2>
<p>Similarly, there are full-time and part-time artists; there are artists who figure in the political establishment and those who are ostracized and despised; and some art forms can be made by anyone, while others demand the devotion of an expert. Claims of an underlying pan-African aesthetic must be viewed as highly contentious.</p>
