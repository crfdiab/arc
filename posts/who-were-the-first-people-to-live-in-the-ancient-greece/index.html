<h2 id=who-were-the-first-people-to-live-in-the-ancient-greece>Who were the first people to live in the Ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>The first people to live in Ancient Greece are Minoans.</p>
<h2 id=who-settled-ancient-greece>Who settled Ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>First People – The Pelasgians. Before the Indo-Europeans settled in Greece, a group known as the Pelasgians lived in Ancient Greece. Very little is known about this group but one thing that people do agree on is that they didn’t leave Greece peacefully.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-citizens-in-ancient-greece>Who were citizens in Ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>The Athenian definition of “citizens” was also different from modern-day citizens: only free men were considered citizens in Athens. Women, children, and slaves were not considered citizens and therefore could not vote.</p>
<h2 id=who-invented-citizenship>Who invented citizenship?</h2>
<p>ancient Greece<br>
The concept of citizenship first arose in towns and city-states of ancient Greece, where it generally applied to property owners but not to women, slaves, or the poorer members of the community.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-it-like-to-live-in-an-ancient-greek-family>What was it like to live in an ancient Greek family?</h2>
<p>What was it like to live in an ancient Greek family? Ancient Greece had a warm, dry climate, as Greece does today. Most people lived by farming, fishing and trade.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-settlers-of-greece-live>Where did the first settlers of Greece live?</h2>
<p>The earliest settlers mostly lived a simple hunter-gatherer or farming lifestyle. The Minoans were the first great Greek civilisation. They didn’t live on mainland Greece but on the nearby island of Crete, between 2200BC and 1450BC. They were known as the Minoans after their legendary king, Minos.</p>

<p>The Minoans were the first great Greek civilisation. They didn’t live on mainland Greece but on the nearby island of Crete, between 2200BC and 1450BC. They were known as the Minoans after their legendary king, Minos. After the Minoans came the Mycenaean civilisation, from mainland Greece.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-people-on-earth-come-from>Where did the first people on Earth come from?</h2>
<p>The first people, or human beings, appeared on Earth some 200,000 years ago on the plains of Sub-Saharan Africa. All modern humans belong to the species known as Homo sapiens that evolved from earlier species of hominids. The term “people” can also be extended to all forms of humans, including earlier hominids from which modern humans derive.</p>
