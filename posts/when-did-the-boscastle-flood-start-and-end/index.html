<h2 id=when-did-the-boscastle-flood-start-and-end>When did the Boscastle flood start and end?</h2>
<p>The last time Boscastle had suffered notable flooding was in 1996 as a result of Hurricane Lili, but floods are recorded in 1847, 1957, on 3 June 1958 (one man drowned) and on 6 February during the Winter of 1962–63 in the United Kingdom…</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-boscastle-flood-2004-happen>Why did the Boscastle flood 2004 happen?</h2>
<p>A lack of flood protection and old, small drainage systems which were insufficient to cope with the flow. Trees and vehicles blocked the river channel, particularly under a bridge in the centre of Boscastle, see Figure 6, which led to the river bursting its banks and further flooding in nearby properties.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-died-in-the-2004-boscastle-floods>How many people died in the 2004 Boscastle floods?</h2>
<p>The Boscastle flood came 52 years to the day after floods in Lynmouth, Devon, swept 34 people to their deaths.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-boscastle-flood-happen-in-2004>When did the Boscastle flood happen in 2004?</h2>
<p>Boscastle Floods. On 16 August 2004, a devastating flood swept through the small Cornish village of Boscastle. Very heavy rain fell in storms close to the village, causing two rivers to burst their banks.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-boscastle-bridge-reopen-after-the-flood>When did the Boscastle bridge reopen after the flood?</h2>
<p>On 1 May 2005, the official reopening of the village, wooden fences were used on the bridge to temporarily replace the stone walls. The bridge used to have a concrete plaque on it saying “This bridge is the private property of the lord of the manor, August 1887”. This was lost during the flood, but then recovered from the harbour in good condition.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-boscastle-flooding-a-case-study>How is Boscastle flooding a case study?</h2>
