<h2 id=what-type-of-slavery-did-the-new-england-colonies-have>What type of slavery did the New England colonies have?</h2>
<p>As a carryover from English practice, indentured servants were the original standard for forced labor in New England and middle colonies like Pennsylvania and Delaware. These indentured servants were people voluntarily working off debts, usually signing a contract to perform slave-level labor for four to seven years.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-point-of-slave-codes>What was the point of Slave Codes?</h2>
<p>The point of slave codes was: Masters wanted laws that would reinforce their power over slaves.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-colonies-have-slave-codes>Why did colonies have slave codes?</h2>
<p>As African Americans in the colonies grew greater and greater in number, there was a justifiable paranoia on the part of the white settlers that a violent rebellion could occur in one’s own neighborhood. It was this fear of rebellion that led each colony to pass a series of laws restricting slaves’ behaviors.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-slave-codes-made-slavery-a-permanent-condition>How did the slave codes made slavery a permanent condition?</h2>
<p>All slave codes made slavery a permanent condition, inherited through the mother, and defined slaves as property. Since the status of the offspring followed that of the mother, the child of a free father and a slave mother was a slave. Slaves, being property, could not own property or be a party to a contract.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-slave-code-in-the-french-colonies>What was the slave code in the French colonies?</h2>
<p>Slave codes left a great deal unsaid, with much of the actual practice of slavery being a matter of traditions rather than formal law. The primary colonial powers all had slightly different slave codes. French colonies, after 1685, had the Code Noir specifically for this purpose.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-slavery-end-in-the-northern-colonies>When did slavery end in the northern colonies?</h2>
<p>The northern colonies developed their own slave codes at later dates, the strictest being in New York, which passed a comprehensive slave code in 1702 and expanded that code in 1712 and 1730. Slavery was restricted throughout the British Empire by the Slave Trade Act of 1807, which prevented trading slaves, but did not actually end slavery.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-slave-codes>What are the different types of slave codes?</h2>
<p>Specific slave codes 1 Barbados slave codes 2 Code Noir; French black code 3 New York slave codes 4 South Carolina slave codes 5 Virginia slave codes of 1705 More …</p>
<h2 id=where-did-slavery-originate-in-the-new-england-colonies>Where did slavery originate in the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>Yet the roots of slavery in the New World go much deeper than that—back to the original British colonies, including the northernmost in New England. New England would later become known for its abolitionist leaders and its role in helping formerly enslaved Southern blacks and those escaping slavery.</p>
