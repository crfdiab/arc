<h2 id=what-was-yamamotos-plan-for-the-battle-of-midway>What was Yamamoto’s plan for the Battle of Midway?</h2>
<p>Yamamoto’s plan called for a feint attack at the Aleutian Islands. The diversion would allow a Japanese battle fleet to neutralize Midway via a surprise aerial bombardment from a fleet carrier force. Then an amphibious landing force would take control of the island.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-japanese-strategy-in-the-pacific>What was the Japanese strategy in the Pacific?</h2>
