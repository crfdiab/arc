<h2 id=can-i-retire-to-alaska>Can I retire to Alaska?</h2>
<p>Alaska could be a much better place to retire than you think. The nation’s largest state has no personal income tax, capital gains tax, estate tax, or state sales tax. Eligible residents of the state can also receive a regular payment for just living in Alaska.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-legally-opt-out-of-social-security>Can you legally opt out of Social Security?</h2>
<p>There is no legal way to stop paying Social Security taxes without applying and receiving approval or becoming a member of a group that is already exempt.</p>

<h2 id=are-replacement-social-security-cards-free>Are replacement Social Security cards free?</h2>
<p>How do I apply for a new or replacement Social Security number card? You can get an original Social Security card or a replacement card if yours is lost or stolen. There is no charge for a Social Security card. This service is free.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-get-a-free-social-security-card>How can I get a free Social Security card?</h2>
<p>If your Social Security card is lost or stolen, you can replace it for free through the Social Security Administration (SSA) website, by visiting a local SSA office or through the mail.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-get-social-security-survivor-benefits>How old do you have to be to get Social Security survivor benefits?</h2>
<p>You can apply for survivor benefits on the record of a deceased spouse or ex-spouse at 60; 50 if you are disabled; or any age if you are caring for the deceased’s under-16 or disabled child. There is no minimum age requirement for Social Security Disability Insurance.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-you-apply-for-social-security-as-a-spouse>What happens when you apply for Social Security as a spouse?</h2>
<p>If you do have enough credits to qualify for your own Social Security benefits and you apply for your own retirement benefits and for benefits as a spouse, we always pay your own benefits first. If your benefits as a spouse are higher than your own retirement benefits, you will get a combination of benefits equaling the higher spouse benefit.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-work-and-collect-social-security-at-the-same-time>Can you work and collect Social Security at the same time?</h2>
<p>You can get Social Security retirement benefits and work at the same time. However, if you are younger than full retirement age and make more than the yearly earnings limit, we will reduce your benefit. Starting with the month you reach full retirement age, we will not reduce your benefits no matter how much you earn.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-limit-to-how-much-you-can-earn-before-you-get-social-security>Is there a limit to how much you can earn before you get Social Security?</h2>
<p>For 2019 that limit is $17,640. In the year you reach full retirement age, we deduct $1 in benefits for every $3 you earn above a different limit, but we only count earnings before the month you reach your full retirement age.</p>
