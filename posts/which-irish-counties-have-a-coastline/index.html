<h2 id=which-irish-counties-have-a-coastline>Which Irish counties have a coastline?</h2>
<p>Ireland has approximately 4,235km of coastline. Munster has the longest provincial coastline, and Donegal has the longest county coastline. The River Shannon is the longest river in Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=does-county-limerick-have-a-coastline>Does county Limerick have a coastline?</h2>
<p>Limerick is an ideal, central, convenient and multi-faceted base from which you can explore the very best of the Wild Atlantic Way. Wild dramatic coastline, unforgettable cliff walks and rolling hills – peppered with historical ruins, picturesque villages, bustling market towns and breathtaking views.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-counties-in-ireland-has-a-coastline>How many counties in Ireland has a coastline?</h2>
<p>Seventeen counties have an ocean/sea coastline: nine with a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean, seven with an Irish sea coastline and three with a coastline on the Celtic Sea.</p>
<h2 id=what-counties-are-landlocked-in-ireland>What counties are landlocked in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Laois is located in the heart of the Irish Midlands. It is bordered by the counties of Offaly, Tipperary, Kilkenny, Carlow and Kildare. All of these counties are landlocked, making Laois the most landlocked county in Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-only-county-in-ireland-with-no-coastline>Which is the only county in Ireland with no coastline?</h2>
<p>Fermanagh, Armagh and Tyrone are the counties of Northern Ireland with no coastline. What counties in Northern Ireland have no coastline? Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh What is the most landlocked county in Ireland? Laois. It is the only county in Ireland that does not touch a county with a coastline, so it is landlocked by landlocked counties.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-land-border-between-northern-ireland-and-republic-of-ireland>Is there a land border between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland?</h2>
<p>Northern Ireland being part of the United Kingdom, there’s a land border between the UK and another country, the Republic of Ireland. In the past, the need for customs and security checks meant that the border was a physical as well as legal and political reality. Nowadays, it isn’t a barrier in any practical sense.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-a-crime-to-cross-the-irish-border>Is it a crime to cross the Irish border?</h2>
<p>Ireland is a country divided in two: in the south and west, the nation of Ireland (often referred to as the Republic of Ireland to avoid confusion), and in the northeast the province of Northern Ireland which is part of the United Kingdom. Both have plenty to do and see, and it would be a crime to make a trip to Ireland and not cross the border.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-border-between-ireland-and-the-uk-invisible>Why is the border between Ireland and the UK Invisible?</h2>
<p>As part of a hard-won peace deal between Ireland and the UK, both governments agreed that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland should be practically invisible – no cameras, no border posts. This was easy when both Ireland and the UK were part of the EU, and people and goods could move between the two countries unhindered.</p>
