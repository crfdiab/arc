<h2 id=which-written-language-did-the-phoenicians-use-first>Which written language did the Phoenicians use first?</h2>
<p>Phoenician/Canaanite Before then the Phoenicians wrote with a cuneiform script. The earliest known inscriptions in the Phoenician alphabet come from Byblos and date back to 1000 BC.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-phoenicians-start-writing>When did the Phoenicians start writing?</h2>
<p>1050 BC<br>
The conventional date of 1050 BC for the emergence of the Phoenician script was chosen because there is a gap in the epigraphic record; there are not actually any Phoenician inscriptions securely dated to the 11th century. The oldest inscriptions are dated to the 10th century.</p>
<h2 id=is-phoenician-the-first-language>Is Phoenician the first language?</h2>
<p>In modern times, the language was first decoded by Jean-Jacques Barthélemy in 1758, who noted that the name “Phoenician” was first given to the language by Samuel Bochart….Phoenician language.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-oldest-known-alphabet>What is the oldest known alphabet?</h2>
<p>The oldest recorded alphabet may be Hebrew. According to a controversial new study by archaeologist and ancient inscription specialist Douglas Petrovich, Israelites in Egypt took 22 ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and turned them into the Hebrew alphabet over 3,800 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=what-language-did-phoenicians-speak>What language did Phoenicians speak?</h2>
<p>Phoenician language, a Semitic language of the Northern Central (often called Northwestern) group, spoken in ancient times on the coast of Syria and Palestine in Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, and neighbouring towns and in other areas of the Mediterranean colonized by Phoenicians.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-phoenicians-writing-system-called>What was the Phoenicians writing system called?</h2>
<p>Phoenician alphabet<br>
Phoenician alphabet, writing system that developed out of the North Semitic alphabet and was spread over the Mediterranean area by Phoenician traders. It is the probable ancestor of the Greek alphabet and, hence, of all Western alphabets.</p>
<h2 id=is-phoenician-a-semitic>Is Phoenician a Semitic?</h2>
<h2 id=who-invented-abcd>Who invented ABCD?</h2>
<p>This set was developed by Semitic-speaking people in the Middle East around 1700 B.C., and was refined and spread to other civilizations by the Phoenicians. This is the foundation of our modern alphabet. We call each of symbol a letter. Each letter of the alphabet represents one sound in our language.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-the-letter-j>How old is the letter J?</h2>
<p>Both I and J were used interchangeably by scribes to express the sound of both the vowel and the consonant. It wasn’t until 1524 when Gian Giorgio Trissino, an Italian Renaissance grammarian known as the father of the letter J, made a clear distinction between the two sounds.</p>
<h2 id=is-phoenician-related-to-hebrew>Is Phoenician related to Hebrew?</h2>
<p>Phoenician is a Canaanite language closely related to Hebrew. Very little is known about the Canaanite language, except what can be gathered from the El-Amarna letters written by Canaanite kings to Pharaohs Amenhopis III (1402 – 1364 BCE) and Akhenaton (1364 – 1347 BCE).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-writing-system-did-the-phoenicians-use>What kind of writing system did the Phoenicians use?</h2>
<p>Writing system. Phoenician was written with the Phoenician script, an abjad (consonantary) originating from the Proto-Canaanite alphabet that also became the basis for the Greek alphabet and, via an Etruscan adaptation, the Latin alphabet.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-phoenician-alphabet-first-attested-to>When was the Phoenician alphabet first attested to?</h2>
<p>It has become conventional to refer to the script as “Proto-Canaanite” until the mid-11th century BC, when it is first attested on inscribed bronze arrowheads, and as “Phoenician” only after 1050 BC. The Phoenician phonetic alphabet is generally believed to be at least the partial ancestor of almost all modern alphabets.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-phoenician-language-most-commonly-spoken>Where was the Phoenician language most commonly spoken?</h2>
<p>Phoenician language. The area where Phoenician was spoken includes modern-day Lebanon, coastal Syria, coastal northern Palestine, parts of Cyprus and, at least as a prestige language, some adjacent areas of Anatolia. It was also spoken in the area of Phoenician colonization along the coasts of the southwestern Mediterranean Sea,…</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-vowels-in-the-phoenician-language>Are there any vowels in the Phoenician language?</h2>
<p>During most of its existence, Phoenician writing showed no vowels at all, and even as vowel notation systems did eventually arise late in its history, they never came to be applied consistently to native vocabulary. It is thought that Phoenician had the short vowels /a/, /i/, /u/ and the long vowels /aː/, /iː/, /uː/, /eː/, /oː/.</p>
