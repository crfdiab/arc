<h2 id=what-are-the-five-key-adaptations-plants-made-to-survive-on-land>What are the five key adaptations plants made to survive on land?</h2>
<p>Terms in this set (5)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>obtaining water and nutrients. from the soil through their roots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>retaining water and prevents water loss. through cuticle and transpiration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support. must be able to support its body and hold up leaves for photosynthesis (using cell walls and vascular tissue)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transporting materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id=reproduction-what-are-two-examples-of-plants-adaptations-in-land>reproduction. What are two examples of plants adaptations in land?</h2>
<p>Like sunken stomata or stomata that opens only late in the evenings and at night which are controlled by guard cells, thick cuticle on leaves, storing water in thick fleshy stems, development of elaborate tap or fibrous root system in search of water are few examples.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-three-adaptations-that-helped-plants-survive-on-land>What are three adaptations that helped plants survive on land?</h2>
<p>Answer: Three adaptations that helped plants survive on land were thin leaves, vascular systems, and stomata.</p>
<h2 id=what-obstacles-did-plants-overcome-to-live-on-land>What obstacles did plants overcome to live on land?</h2>
<p>The life on land presents significant challenges for plants, including the potential for desiccation, mutagenic radiation from the sun, and a lack of buoyancy from the water.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-four-major-challenges-to-plants-living-on-land>What are the four major challenges to plants living on land?</h2>
<p>There are four major challenges to plants living on land: obtaining resources, staying upright, maintaining moisture, and reproducing. Obtaining Resources From Two Places at Once Algae and other aquatic organisms acquire the resources they need from the surrounding water.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-adaptations-explain-with-example>What are adaptations explain with example?</h2>
<p>Adaptation is the evolutionary process where an organism becomes better suited to its habitat. An example is the adaptation of horses’ teeth to grinding grass. Grass is their usual food; it wears the teeth down, but horses’ teeth continue to grow during life.</p>
<h2 id=which-adaptation-is-most-important-for-plants>Which adaptation is most important for plants?</h2>
<p>The stomata of many cacti lie deep in the plants’ tissues. This adaptation helps cacti reduce water loss by keeping the hot, dry wind from blowing directly across the stomata. The leaves and stems of many desert plants have a thick, waxy covering.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-plant-adaptations>What are the 3 plant adaptations?</h2>
<p>Plant adaptations</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Drip tips – plants have leaves with pointy tips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buttress roots – large roots have ridges which create a large surface area that help to support large trees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id=epiphytes--these-are-plants-which-live-on-the-branches-of-trees-high-up-in-the-canopy-what-challenges-did-plants-need-to-overcome-in-order-to-live-on-land>Epiphytes – these are plants which live on the branches of trees high up in the canopy. What challenges did plants need to overcome in order to live on land?</h2>
<h2 id=what-are-the-types-of-adaptations>What are the types of adaptations?</h2>
<p>There are three different types of adaptations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Behavioural – responses made by an organism that help it to survive/reproduce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physiological – a body process that helps an organism to survive/reproduce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id=structural--a-feature-of-an-organisms-body-that-helps-it-to-survivereproduce-how-do-plants-protect-themselves>Structural – a feature of an organism’s body that helps it to survive/reproduce. How do plants protect themselves?</h2>
<p>The first line of defense in plants is an intact and impenetrable barrier composed of bark and a waxy cuticle. Both protect plants against herbivores. Other adaptations against herbivores include hard shells, thorns (modified branches), and spines (modified leaves).</p>
<h2 id=how-are-plants-adapted-to-life-on-land>How are plants adapted to life on land?</h2>
<p>Plants have evolved several adaptations to life on land, including embryo retention, a cuticle, stomata, and vascular tissue. We all struggle to learn the complex concept in the class and spend elongated hours searching for methods to help […]</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-example-of-an-adaptation>Which is the best example of an adaptation?</h2>
<p>An adaptation is just a mutation that worked out well for a plant or animal. Plants adapt in many ways to be able to survive or thrive in their surroundings. Discover several plant adaptation examples specific to different environments. Living in a desert environment poses unique challenges for plant life.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-photosynthetic-organisms-adapt-to-life-on-land>How did photosynthetic organisms adapt to life on land?</h2>
<p>The first photosynthetic organisms were bacteria that lived in the water. There are four main ways that plants adapted to life on land and, as a result, became different from algae: 1.In plants, the embryo develops inside of the female plant after fertilization. Algae do not keep the embryo inside of themselves but release it into water.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-plants-adapted-to-survive-in-the-tropical-rainforest>How are plants adapted to survive in the tropical rainforest?</h2>
<p>The sizable surface area of their leaves allows them to catch as much light as possible, which helps them survive. Many tropical rainforest plants are poisonous, an adaptation to the presence of many herbivorous animals in the tropical rainforest.</p>
