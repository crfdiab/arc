<h2 id=why-was-he-sent-to-camp-green-lake>Why was he sent to Camp Green Lake?</h2>
<p>In the story, Stanley Yelnats IV, a teenager, is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention camp, for stealing a pair of sneakers. Green Lake was a dried-up lakebed in Texas where the camp detainees were forced by the evil warden (played by Sigourney Weaver) to dig holes looking for a buried treasure.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-stanley-do-to-go-to-camp-green-lake>What did Stanley do to go to Camp Green Lake?</h2>
<p>While Stanley was walking, a pair of shoes had fallen from a freeway overpass, and hit him on the head. Stanley was convicted of stealing the shoes and sent to Camp Green Lake.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-dangerous-thing-at-camp-green-lake>What is the most dangerous thing at Camp Green Lake?</h2>
<p>The yellow-spotted lizard is the most dangerous creature at Camp Green Lake. It’s poison is lethal and will kill you if you get bitten.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-dangerous-animal-in-holes>What was the dangerous animal in holes?</h2>
<p>The Yellow Spotted Lizard is a venomous creature that inhabits the arid wasteland of Green Lake. Each lizard has yellow eyes, black teeth, red-rimmed eyelids, a milky white tongue, greenish skin, and exactly 11 spots.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-theodore-called-armpit-at-camp-green-lake>Why was Theodore called armpit at Camp Green Lake?</h2>
<p>Theodore arrived at Camp Green Lake, was assigned to D-Tent and received his nickname, Armpit, due to his body odor. Anyone who called Armpit by his real name, Theodore, would get shoved to the ground by him when Mr. Pendanski wasn’t present.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-stanley-go-to-camp-green-lake>Why did Stanley go to Camp Green Lake?</h2>
<p>But there he was caught, arrested and then he had to go to Camp Green Lake. Also Stanley had to go to Camp Green Lake because of a pair of shoes – the ones from Clyde! They must be fallen down when the car, where Zero put the shoes on top, started to drive. Then Stanley caught the shoes and the rest of the story is (anyway i think so) clear.</p>

<h2 id=what-happens-at-the-end-of-camp-green-lake>What happens at the end of Camp Green Lake?</h2>
<p>When Zero and Stanley are released from the camp, it rains again for the first time in 100 years and the Warden, Pendanski and Sir are all arrested, which leads to Camp Green Lake being shut down and turned into a Girl-Scout Camp. It hasn’t rained for one hundred years on Camp Green Lake.</p>
