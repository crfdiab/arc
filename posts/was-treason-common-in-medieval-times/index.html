<h2 id=was-treason-common-in-medieval-times>Was treason common in medieval times?</h2>
<p>Treason was a very common crime that was administered by the king himself. The Middle Ages was a turbulent time that was marked by social change, wars, revolutions, rebellions, religious changes, and other unrest.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-people-start-stealing>When did people start stealing?</h2>
<p>The first documented shoplifting started to take place in 16th century London. By the early 19th century, shoplifting was believed to be primarily a female activity. In the 1960s, shoplifting began to be redefined again, this time as a political act.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-most-feared-criminals-during-the-medieval-period>Who were the most feared criminals during the medieval period?</h2>
<p>These crimes which were regarded as serious included treason, revolt, sheltering criminals, blasphemy and heresy. The most notorious heretics were the Lollards, the followers of John Wycliffe, who challenged the teachings of the Catholic Church in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.</p>
<h2 id=was-medieval-times-bad>Was Medieval Times Bad?</h2>
<p>Not for nothing is the Medieval period often referred to as the â€˜Dark Ages’. Not only was it incredibly gloomy, it was also quite a miserable time to be alive. Sure, some kings and nobles lived in relative splendor, but for most people, everyday life was dirty, boring and treacherous.</p>
<h2 id=why-you-should-not-steal>Why you should not steal?</h2>
<p>Stealing causes a big problem for a family when the thief is caught. Store owners have to spend more money to protect their things, which makes prices go up for paying customers. Kids sometimes don’t trust each other with their belongings. People don’t feel as safe when they’re worried about someone stealing.</p>
<h2 id=is-stealing-a-sin>Is stealing a sin?</h2>
<p>Now through theft a man inflicts harm on a neighbor in his possessions, and if men were to steal from one another indiscriminately, human society would perish. Hence, theft, as contrary to charity, is a mortal sin.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-do-for-fun-in-medieval-times>What did people do for fun in medieval times?</h2>
<p>Performers known as troubadours and minstrels were popular in this era. In conclusion, entertainment in the medieval era was done in simplicity at times and over the top at other times.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-punishment-for-full-thievery-in-medieval-times>What was the punishment for full thievery in medieval times?</h2>
<p>“Full thievery” meant stealing something worth 1/2 mark or more, and was punished by hanging from a tree or a gallows, or by banishment from the city and its environs. If the goods were worth between three öre and 1/2 mark, it would cost the thief skin (through flogging) and one or both ears.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-do-on-may-day-in-medieval-times>What did people do on May Day in medieval times?</h2>
<p>There was also the May Day festival when people danced around a pole and played games with children. The wealthy in the medieval era entertained themselves in various ways. Banquets were well-known feasts among the rich and these feasts lasted for most of the night until the early morning hours.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-joke-about-in-medieval-times>What did people joke about in medieval times?</h2>
<p>From stand-up comics to television sitcoms, modern culture is awash with humour. But what did people joke about in the medieval period? Historian Jamie Kreiner investigates…</p>
