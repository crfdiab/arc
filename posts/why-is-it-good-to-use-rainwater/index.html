<h2 id=why-is-it-good-to-use-rainwater>Why is it good to use rainwater?</h2>
<p>Rainwater is relatively pure stuff. Besides being natural, rainwater is usually soft, which makes it a good option for watering your flowers and plants. Actually, the absence of those very chemicals that make tap water safe for drinking makes rainwater a better choice for your outdoor watering needs.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-ways-we-can-reuse-rainwater>What are the ways we can reuse rainwater?</h2>
<p>Ways to recycle and use rainwater at home !</p>
<ul>
<li>LETS GET LOST IN A WORLD MADE OF BOOKS, COFFEE AND RAINY DAYS.</li>
<li>Watering the garden.</li>
<li>Washing your cycles/cars.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id=where-do-we-use-rainwater>Where do we use rainwater?</h2>
<p>Rainwater can be used for a wide range of purposes in and around your home. Using rainwater for toilet flushing, clothes washing, bathing and showering make the biggest contribution to saving water, as they use a high volume of water all year round.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-rainwater-be-beneficial-to-us>How can rainwater be beneficial to us?</h2>
<p>What are the benefits of rainwater harvesting? It will reduce water bills, provide an alternative supply during water restrictions and help maintain a green, healthy garden. In fact, depending upon tank size and climate, rainwater harvesting can reduce mains water use by 100%.</p>
<h2 id=can-we-drink-rain-water-directly>Can we drink rain water directly?</h2>
<p>It is possible, therefore, for us to drink untreated rainwater. This is because rainwater is pure, distilled water evaporated from the sun – nothing else. However, when rainwater falls from the sky, substances from the air and land melt into the rainwater. This water (groundwater) is relatively safe for drinking.</p>
<h2 id=where-we-can-store-rainwater>Where we can store rainwater?</h2>
<p>A rainwater tank (sometimes called a rain barrel in North America in reference to smaller tanks, or a water butt in the UK) is a water tank used to collect and store rain water runoff, typically from rooftops via pipes. Rainwater tanks are devices for collecting and maintaining harvested rain.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-save-rainwater-for-long-time>How can we save rainwater for long time?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Keep the terrace clean.</li>
<li>Clean the filter medium twice a year, before and after rainy season.</li>
<li>Replace the filter medium once in two years.</li>
<li>Large-scale tarring or asbestos material should not be kept on the terrace.</li>
<li>Avoid heavy use of pesticides or fertilisers on the terrace.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-are-the-sources-of-rainwater>What are the sources of rainwater?</h2>
<p>Rain and snow, collectively known as precipitation, fall from the clouds. Some water that falls on the ground forms run-off which collects into streams and rivers and some percolates through the soil to become groundwater, which is held in layers of rock called aquifers.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-collecting-rainwater-bad>Why is collecting rainwater bad?</h2>
<p>Rain can wash different types of contaminants into the water you collect (for example, bird poop on your roof could end up in your water barrel or tank). Rainwater can carry bacteria, parasites, viruses, and chemicals that could make you sick, and it has been linked to disease outbreaks.</p>
<h2 id=is-rainwater-good-to-drink>Is rainwater good to drink?</h2>
<p>Thus, it’s not advisable to start collecting and drinking rainwater unless you’re 100% certain it’s clean and safe for human consumption. Although clean rainwater is safe to drink, it can easily become contaminated as it falls, which could pose a significant health hazard.</p>
<h2 id=is-rain-water-good-for-hair>Is rain water good for hair?</h2>
<p>Rain water for hair: When you get drenched in the rain, the water tends to make your hair sticky and dull. The water only damages the cuticles and makes your hair rough and dry. Also, if the water has high pH level, it could give you burns and your hair might end up getting brittle.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-do-with-the-rain-water>What can you do with the rain water?</h2>
<p>Rainwater is also typically safe for pets or livestock to drink or wash in, especially if you have a method to collect clean rainwater directly. 7. Outdoor ponds and water features Rainwater can be filtered for use in fountains or other water features with pumps that could get clogged.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-collect-rain-water-from-my-roof>How can I collect rain water from my roof?</h2>
<p>Place your rain barrels right under the down spouts on your gutters. This assures that the water run-off from the roof gets into your rain barrel. What’s great about rain barrels is that they have a spout at the bottom of them so that the rain water can flow out. Simply fill up smaller containers or hook up your hose to the spout.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-use-rain-water-inside-your-home>Is it safe to use rain water inside your home?</h2>
<p>Rainwater itself is generally clean, but it can pick up microorganisms, pollutants and debris when it hits your roof. This is why systems for rainwater use inside your home often include filtration or other treatments for safety. Outdoor rainwater collection systems don’t need as much treatment because the water is typically used outside.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-use-to-purify-rainwater-for-drinking>What to use to purify rainwater for drinking?</h2>
<p>There are a variety of home-scale and portable water treatment methods available at sporting-goods or outdoor retailers. From tablets to carbon filters to uv light, find a method or two that fit your style and budget, and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with being prepared.</p>
