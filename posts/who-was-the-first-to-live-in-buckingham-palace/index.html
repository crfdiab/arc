<h2 id=who-was-the-first-to-live-in-buckingham-palace>Who was the first to live in Buckingham Palace?</h2>
<p>Queen Victoria<br>
Queen Victoria was the first sovereign to take up residence in July 1837 and in June 1838 she was the first British sovereign to leave from Buckingham Palace for a Coronation. Her marriage to Prince Albert in 1840 soon showed up the Palace’s shortcomings.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-buckingham-palace-before>What was Buckingham Palace before?</h2>
<p>The Queen’s House Buckingham House remained the property of the Dukes of Buckingham until 1762, when George III acquired the whole site as a private family residence for his wife, Queen Charlotte, and their children. It was known as ‘The Queen’s House’. St James’ Palace remained the official seat of the court.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-buckingham-palace-built-and-how-long-did-it-take>When was Buckingham Palace built and how long did it take?</h2>
<p>Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today’s palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years.</p>
<h2 id=does-buckingham-palace-have-ac>Does Buckingham Palace have AC?</h2>
<p>There are 1,514 doors and 760 windows in Buckingham Palace. With that many holes on your wall, air conditioning can get a little tricky. There is a royally robust air conditioning equipment on the roof of the south-west wing of the palace.</p>
<h2 id=does-queen-elizabeth-own-buckingham-palace>Does Queen Elizabeth own Buckingham Palace?</h2>
<p>Occupied Royal Palaces, such as Buckingham Palace, are not the private property of The Queen. They are occupied by the Sovereign and held in trust by Crown Estates for future generations. The Queen privately owns two properties, Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House, which are not publicly funded.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-duke-of-buckingham-build-buckingham-palace>When did the Duke of Buckingham build Buckingham Palace?</h2>
<p>It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning. Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today’s palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-triumphal-arch-at-buckingham-palace-built>When was the triumphal arch at Buckingham Palace built?</h2>
<p>So, in 1845, the architect Edward Blore was retained to enclose Nash’s forecourt on the eastern side, for the construction of staterooms and ballrooms. Buckingham Palace’s triumphal arch was moved to nearby Hyde Park. Construction was completed in 1853, and Queen Victoria reigned until her death in 1901.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-monarch-to-live-in-buckingham-palace>Who was the first monarch to live in Buckingham Palace?</h2>
<p>George III’s successor, his son George IV, was the first monarch to see palace potential in Buckingham House. With the help of his architect, John Nash, he converted it into a full-scale residential and ceremonial palace.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-buckingham-palace-like-the-white-house>How is Buckingham Palace like the White House?</h2>
<p>Buckingham Palace presents an inscrutable facade. It possesses a composite aura of authority, much as the White House does in America. The edifice has come to embody the voice of royalty; statements issued to the world from behind these walls begin with the words ‘Buckingham Palace announced today. . . .’</p>
