<h2 id=why-do-we-lose-weight-on-the-moon>Why do we lose weight on the Moon?</h2>
<p>Why is your weight on the Moon so much less than your weight on the Earth? It’s because of the lower gravity on the Moon. Objects on the surface of the Moon experience only 16.5% of the gravity they would experience on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-lose-weight-in-space>Why do we lose weight in space?</h2>
<p>The weight loss is one of a number of rapid body changes observed during the flight. The crew consumed 70% less fluid and food on the first flight day, Leach said. That probably was partly because most of them were stricken with space motion sickness, she said.</p>
<h2 id=does-going-to-the-moon-make-you-lose-weight>Does going to the Moon make you lose weight?</h2>
<p>Ultimately you may lose weight by moon eating, but that’s merely a welcome side effect; the primary goal of mindful consumption is truer connection to our planet and thus a heightened sense of well being—both emotionally and physically. It’s a lifestyle.</p>
<h2 id=can-u-lose-weight-in-space>Can u lose weight in space?</h2>
<p>Astronauts lose weight in space, and it might be because their food is literally floating around inside them. Stomachs weren’t built for space.</p>
<h2 id=do-astronauts-eat-less>Do astronauts eat less?</h2>
<p>There are numerous challenges to eating in space and low gravity conditions – not only the primary issue of getting the food from the package into astronaut’s mouth. There are many health considerations. Over long periods in space, muscle mass and bone density can decrease by up to twenty per cent.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-eat-on-a-new-moon>What do you eat on a new moon?</h2>
<p>Drink about eight glasses of water each day, and eat only solids like salads, fruits etc). – The next phase is the new moon, which is similar to the full moon. Consume fluids and no solids at this time. – The last phase, the waxing moon, is the hardest because your food cravings will increase.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-our-weight-on-the-moon-less-than-on-earth>Why is our weight on the Moon less than on Earth?</h2>
<p>Our weight on moon is less than it would be on Earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon’s gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-astronauts-lose-so-much-weight-in-space>Why do astronauts lose so much weight in space?</h2>
<p>Weight maintenance while in space has been a challenge for astronauts for decades, and in fact used to be considered an unavoidable side-effect. “If I go back about five years ago, many people would say that everybody loses weight in flight, and that’s just something we have to get used to.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-moon-compare-to-the-earth>How does the Moon compare to the Earth?</h2>
<p>This means you weigh six times less on the Moon than you do on Earth. So an object or person on the moon would weigh 16.5% its weight on earth. Therefore, a person would be much lighter on the moon. Conversely, a person is 83.5% heavier on earth than on the moon.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-gravitation-force-of-the-moon-determined>How is the gravitation force of the moon determined?</h2>
<p>The moon’s gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon. Since the moon has significantly less mass than the Earth, it will not pull objects toward itself at the strength that Earth will. This means that if you went to the moon you would weigh less, even though your mass stays the same! Posted on June 15, 2016 at 6:12 pm</p>
