<h2 id=how-land-pollution-and-water-pollution-are-linked>How land pollution and water pollution are linked?</h2>
<p>Water- and soil-polluting substances are often due to man-made wastes such as household garbage, manufacturing and agricultural wastes, fertilizers used by farmers, oil spills, and radioactive materials [1,2,3]. Water pollution can contribute to soil pollution and vice versa [7, 8].</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-similarities-between-air-pollution-and-water-pollution>What are the similarities between air pollution and water pollution?</h2>
<p>Explanation: Air pollution is either by particulate matter or gaseous compounds. Water pollution is usually by either solid or liquid compounds that are not a normal part of the water system, or at levels greatly exceeding the normal levels of those compounds in a water system.</p>
<h2 id=which-two-types-of-pollution-are-closely-related>Which two types of pollution are closely related?</h2>
<p>There are different types of pollution: water pollution, air pollution, solid waste pollution and noise pollution. All of these can be found in urban areas. The main sources of pollution are household activities, factories, agriculture and transport.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-land-and-water-pollution>What is the difference between land and water pollution?</h2>
<p>Water pollution is usually by either solid or liquid compounds that are not a normal part of the water system, or at levels greatly exceeding the normal levels of those compounds in a water system. Soil pollution is caused also by presence of various chemicals or alteration.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-air-and-water-pollution-affect-the-environment>How does air and water pollution affect the environment?</h2>
<p>Air pollution can also have a direct effect on water pollution. When particles like sulfur dioxide get high into the air they can combine with rain to produce acid rain. Acid rain can turn lakes acidic, killing fishes and other animals. Water pollution can have disastrous effects on the environment.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-air-pollution-water-pollution-and-land-pollution-related>How are air pollution, water pollution and land pollution related?</h2>
<p>Pollution can be formally defined as the undesirable and unintended contamination of the environment by human activities such as manufacturing, waste disposal, burning fossil fuels etc. The effect of pollution can be experienced in different ways. The most common ways of pollution are: Air pollution. Water pollution. Land pollution.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-land-pollution-affect-the-upper-layer>How does land pollution affect the upper layer?</h2>
<p>Land Pollution Causes Soil pollution is a form of land pollution in which the soil’s upper layer is harmed. Overuse of chemical fertilizers, soil degradation caused by running water, and other pest control measures contribute to the loss of agricultural land, forest cover, and grazing pastures, among other things.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-land-pollution-on-animals>What are the effects of land pollution on animals?</h2>
<p>But with land pollution, it can be harder because the effects happen underneath the ground and in the chemical balance of the ecosystems. Nevertheless, it is a growing problem that needs to be aware of. Soil pollution includes any contaminants or chemicals that harm the animals or plant species.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-pollution-is-bad-for-the-environment>What kind of pollution is bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>Pollution is making the environment unsafe and unsuitable. Pollution, is the addition of any substance or any form of energy to the environment at a rate faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some harmless form. Some major types of pollution are air pollution, water pollution and land pollution.</p>
