<h2 id=did-henry-hudson-discover-any-land>Did Henry Hudson discover any land?</h2>
<p>Hudson’s discoveries laid the groundwork for Dutch colonization of the Hudson River region, as well as English land claims in Canada.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-did-henry-hudson-find>What countries did Henry Hudson find?</h2>
<p>Henry Hudson was an English navigator and explorer who set out to find either a northeast passage “by the North Pole to Japan and China” or a similar northwest passage. Though neither passage was found, his attempts contributed significantly to the navigational geography of North America.</p>
<h2 id=what-new-land-did-henry-hudson-discover>What new land did Henry Hudson discover?</h2>
<p>He found what is now called the Hudson River. Hudson is credited with discovering the location which is now New York City (although da Verrazzano had previously sailed by the area in 1524). Hudson sailed into New York’s harbor on September 3, 1609 and noted what an excellent harbor it was.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-henry-hudson-discover-in-north-america>What did Henry Hudson discover in North America?</h2>
<p>Henry Hudson discovered three waterways in North America that were later named after him: the Hudson Strait, the Hudson Bay and the Hudson River. Henry Hudson, who was a sea captain and an explorer, lived between 1565 and 1611. During his lifetime, Henry made four voyages to find out a northern route to connect Europe and Asia.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-henry-hudson-land-in-new-york>Where did Henry Hudson land in New York?</h2>
<p>Hudson landed along the coast of Maine and then continued south to Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. After deciding that these were not the passageways he was looking for, Hudson turned north, discovering and exploring the Hudson River along the way.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-henry-hudson-go-on-his-first-voyage>When did Henry Hudson go on his first voyage?</h2>
<p>Henry Hudson. Henry Hudson made his first voyage west from England in 1607, when he was hired to find a shorter route to Asia from Europe through the Arctic Ocean. After twice being turned back by ice, Hudson embarked on a third voyage–this time on behalf of the Dutch East India Company–in 1609.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-henry-hudson-contribute-to-the-colonization-of-canada>How did Henry Hudson contribute to the colonization of Canada?</h2>
<p>Hudson’s discoveries laid the groundwork for Dutch colonization of the Hudson River region, as well as English land claims in Canada. Though little is known about Hudson’s early life, it seems he studied navigation and earned widespread renown for his skills, as well as his knowledge of Arctic geography.</p>
