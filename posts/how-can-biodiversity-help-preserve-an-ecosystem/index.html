<h2 id=how-can-biodiversity-help-preserve-an-ecosystem>How can biodiversity help preserve an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Biodiversity boosts ecosystem productivity where each species, no matter how small, all have an important role to play. For example, A larger number of plant species means a greater variety of crops. Greater species diversity ensures natural sustainability for all life forms.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-biodiversity-and-how-does-it-help-ecosystems-be-sustainable>What is biodiversity and how does it help ecosystems be sustainable?</h2>
<p>The higher biodiversity in an ecosystem means that there is a greater variety of genes and species in that ecosystem. A great variety of genes and species means that the ecosystem is better able to carry out natural processes in the face of external stress. Thus, the ecosystem is more sustainable.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-hotspots-in-conserving-biodiversity>What is the importance of hotspots in conserving biodiversity?</h2>
<p>These areas that are particularly important for biodiversity conservation are called biodiversity hotspots. Two things are crucial when determining that a place is a biodiversity hotspot: (i) the number of different species there; and (ii) whether species in that area are endangered or currently being destroyed.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-scientific-factors-of-sustainability>What are the 3 scientific factors of sustainability?</h2>
<p>Sustainability is most often defined as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. It has three main pillars: economic, environmental, and social. These three pillars are informally referred to as people, planet and profits.</p>

<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-protect-hotspots>Why is it important to protect hotspots?</h2>
<p>Biodiversity underpins all life on Earth. Without species, there would be no air to breathe, no food to eat, no water to drink. There would be no human society at all. And as the places on Earth where the most biodiversity is under the most threat, hotspots are critical to human survival.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-prevent-loss-of-biodiversity>How can we prevent loss of biodiversity?</h2>
<p>Leave critical wildlife habitat undisturbed, especially nesting and denning sites. Promote wildlife use by setting up bird and bat houses. Eradicate and control introduced weeds on your property. Keep vehicles on main roads to reduce the spread of weeds and disturbance to wildlife.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-and-effects-of-loss-of-biodiversity>What are the causes and effects of loss of biodiversity?</h2>
<p>Biodiversity loss is caused by five primary drivers: habitat loss, invasive species, overexploitation (extreme hunting and fishing pressure), pollution, climate change associated with global warming. In each case, human beings and their activities play direct roles.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-best-preserve-biological-diversity-and-protect-endangered-ecosystems>How can we best preserve biological diversity and protect endangered ecosystems?</h2>
<p>Widespread concerns about the rate and impact of biodiversity and ecosystem loss has generated important international programs of research such as the DIVERSITAS initiative supported by governments in Asia, the Americas, and Europe. Suggested Citation: “2 How Can We Best Preserve Biological Diversity and Protect Endangered Ecosystems?.”</p>
<h2 id=how-are-communities-helping-to-protect-natural-resources>How are communities helping to protect natural resources?</h2>
<p>Communities can promote healthy wildlife by supporting integrative approaches for managing, protecting, and enhancing wildlife populations and habitats appropriate to their area. Some examples are given here.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-biodiversity-important-for-a-healthy-ecosystem>Why is biodiversity important for a healthy ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Biodiversity. Biodiversity is particularly important for creating sustainability because of the specialized roles each species plays in maintaining ecological balance. Communities can promote healthy wildlife by supporting integrative approaches for managing, protecting, and enhancing wildlife populations and habitats appropriate to their area.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-ex-situ-biodiversity>Which is an example of ex situ biodiversity?</h2>
<p>Ex situ biodiversity conservation is the maintenance of endangered species at areas outside their natural ranges or habitats. Examples include the preservation of an animal species population in a zoo or wild animal conservation areas or the preservation of a plant species population in a botanical garden.</p>
