<p>Harpy Eagle<br>
The Harpy Eagle (Harpia harpyja) is the largest raptor in the Amazon rainforest and one of the biggest eagles in the world. Although there are healthy populations of this majestic bird in the Peruvian rainforests of Tambopata, they are very difficult to see.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-birds-found-in-the-rainforest>Where are birds found in the rainforest?</h2>
<p>Most birds live in the dense undercover of the forest, looking for insects from the rainforest floor to the canopy. Others prefer flying insects, or fruit and flowers while some, such as the harpy eagle, capture other mammals and reptiles and birds.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-the-birds-live>Where do the birds live?</h2>
<p>Birds live in diverse habitats: deserts, mountains, forests, tundras, near the bodies of water, etc. A lot of birds never leave their living places, the others migrate to warmer countries when the weather changes.</p>

<h2 id=why-are-birds-important-to-the-rain-forest>Why are birds important to the rain forest?</h2>
<p>Rainforests are also old and stable ecosystems. What we see there today is the result of millions of years of evolution. Birds not only thrive in these ecosystems — they play crucial roles in maintaining them. As seed dispersers and pollinators, fruit-eating birds ensure the continued reproduction of the plants they depend on for food.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-insects-live-in-the-rainforest>What kind of insects live in the rainforest?</h2>
<p>Insects are numerous and can grow to incredible sizes in the rainforest. Queen Alexandra’s birdwing grows to nearly a foot in width, making it the world’s largest butterfly. The Goliath bird eater is a large ground dwelling spider large enough to eat birds and rodents. The Glyptapanteles wasp is parasitic and lays its larvae inside caterpillars.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-animals-in-the-rainforest>Why are there so many animals in the rainforest?</h2>
<p>The reason the rainforest is home to so many plants and creatures is because there’s constant access to energy, water, food and carbon. Examples of Rainforest Bird Scarlet Macaw, Toco Toucan, and Xenops</p>
