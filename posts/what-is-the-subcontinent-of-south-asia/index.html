<p>Indian subcontinent<br>
The Indian subcontinent, or simply the subcontinent, is a physiographical region in South Asia. It is situated on the Indian Plate and projecting southwards into the Indian Ocean from the Himalayas.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-largest-country-on-the-subcontinent-of-south-asia>What is the largest country on the subcontinent of South Asia?</h2>
<p>Afghanistan<br>
Afghanistan. A landlocked country located within South Asia and Central Asia with land area of 652,000 km2, Afghanistan is the 41st largest country in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-dominates-biggest-most-important-controls-the-subcontinent-of-south-asia>What country dominates biggest most important controls the subcontinent of South Asia?</h2>
<p>In fact, it is often referred to as the Indian subcontinent because India dominates the region. Although South Asia is about half the size of the continental United States, it has more than one billion inhabitants—one-fifth of the world’s population.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-indian-subcontinent-the-same-as-south-asia>Is the Indian subcontinent the same as South Asia?</h2>
<p>The appellations South Asia and the Indian subcontinent are synonymous. The area was usually referred to as Britain’s Indian Empire or Raj prior to 1947. Most geographers, such as Sir Dudley Stamp, called it the Indian subcontinent because of its separation from the rest of the Asian landmass by a continuous barrier of mountains in the north.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-constituent-countries-of-south-asia>What are the constituent countries of South Asia?</h2>
<p>South Asia: Constituent Countries And Their Populations And Economies. Southern Asia is bordered to the south by the Indian Ocean, to the west by West Asia, and the South by Southern Asia. The countries that make up South Asia include Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Bhutan, and Maldives.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-part-of-south-asia-is-above-sea-level>Which is part of South Asia is above sea level?</h2>
<p>Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian Plate, which rises above sea level as Nepal and northern parts of India situated south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land (clockwise, from west) by West Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia .</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-eurasian-and-indian-subcontinent-meet>Where does the Eurasian and Indian subcontinent meet?</h2>
<p>Geology. This geological region largely includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The zone where the Eurasian and Indian subcontinent plates meet remains one of the geologically active areas, prone to major earthquakes.</p>
