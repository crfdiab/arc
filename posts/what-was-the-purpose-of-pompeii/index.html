<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-pompeii>What was the purpose of Pompeii?</h2>
<p>Locally, however, Pompeii was an important inland port, a place of trade, industry and business, famed for its fermented fish sauce. Its people were a mix of wealthy elite, professionals and slaves. Inscriptions attest to bakers and bath-attendants, grape-pickers and prostitutes.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-pompeii-live-near-a-volcano>Why did Pompeii live near a volcano?</h2>
<p>In real life, Pompeii was an ancient Roman resort town built at the base of the volcano Mt. Vesuvius. Its citizens were killed instantly in 79 AD by a blast of superheated gas from an eruption, and their city was perfectly preserved by the thick rain of ash that followed.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-pompeii-abandoned>Why was Pompeii abandoned?</h2>
<p>Sixteen years after that telltale earthquake, in either August or October 79 A.D. (more recent evidence suggests the eruption took place in October), Mount Vesuvius erupted again. By the time the Vesuvius eruption sputtered to an end the next day, Pompeii was buried under millions of tons of volcanic ash.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-pompeii-get-built>When did Pompeii get built?</h2>
<p>Pompeii, unlike the other towns in Campania founded for the most part by Greek colonists, was built by the Oscans, probably around the 9-8th century B.C., even if the evidence now available does not go back beyond the 6th century. The town developed on lava terracing formed many centuries earlier.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-the-city-of-pompeii>What was the history of the city of Pompeii?</h2>
<p>Pompeii history. FROM THE ORIGINS TO THE ERUPTION OF 79 A. D. Pompei was founded in the VII century B.C. by the Oscans who settled on the slopes of Vesuvius and in an area not far from the river Sarno. The first settlements are dating back to the Iron Age (IX-VII centuries B.C.). In that period Pompei was an important trade centre…</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-buildings-did-the-romans-build-in-pompeii>What kind of buildings did the Romans build in Pompeii?</h2>
<p>Under the Romans, Pompeii underwent a vast process of urban development especially in the Augustan period. Public buildings include the forum, the amphitheatre with palaestra or gymnasium with a central natatorium (cella natatoria) or swimming pool, two theatres and at least four public baths.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-builder-of-the-amphitheater-in-pompeii>Who was the builder of the amphitheater in Pompeii?</h2>
<p>According to inscriptions, the amphitheater in Pompeii was constructed at private expense by two of Lucius Cornelius Sulla’s commanders – Marcius Porcius and Quinctius Valgus. Instead of being referred to as an amphitheatrum, the term spectacula was initially used to describe the iconic structure.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-pompeii-important-to-the-vesuvius-eruption>Why was Pompeii important to the Vesuvius eruption?</h2>
<p>The slopes of Vesuvius were known for its fertile soils and wine from Pompeii was an important export – at least one wine jar made it all the way to England. But people were less aware of the volcano’s dark side. The city had been badly damaged by severe earthquakes 15 years before the eruption. Yet none of this was connected to volcanism.</p>
