<p>20,000 workers<br>
The building of Central Park was one of nineteenth-century New York’s most massive public works projects. Some 20,000 workers–Yankee engineers, Irish laborers, German gardeners, and native-born stonecutters–reshaped the site’s topography to create the pastoral landscape.</p>

<p>Central Park is a National Historic Landscape (1963) and a Scenic Landscape of the City of New York (1974). Located in what is now the center of Manhattan, the site was far from the built-up areas of the City when planning for the Park began in the 1850s.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-central-park-in-new-york>What was the history of Central Park in New York?</h2>
<p>To understand Central Park’s history, one must learn the reasons for its creation, the process of its making, and the outcomes in its earliest years. During the early to mid-19 th century, New York City was becoming only an island of buildings. The city streets were crowded with buildings and little amounts of green land.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-did-it-cost-to-build-central-park>How much did it cost to build Central Park?</h2>
<p>Originally conceived in the salons of wealthy New Yorkers in the early 1850’s, the park project spanned more than a decade and cost the city ten million dollars.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-visit-central-park-each-year>How many people visit Central Park each year?</h2>
<p>Over 150 years later, the Park still provides this essential purpose, and welcomes all visitors, while accommodating newer forms of recreational activities. With 42 million visits a year, Central Park is one of the most visited urban parks in the country and one of the most popular destinations in New York City.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-first-park-in-new-york>How big was the first park in New York?</h2>
<p>In 1853, the New York State legislature passed the law to set aside 750 acres in Manhattan for America’s first major public landscaped park. Although it’s true that some rich New Yorkers simply wanted a beautiful park similar to those in London, thus making New York a world-class destination, “I’m a little more cynical,” says Kamil.</p>
