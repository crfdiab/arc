<h2 id=what-was-the-basis-of-mercantilism>What was the basis of mercantilism?</h2>
<p>First popularized in Europe during the 1500s, mercantilism was based on the idea that a nation’s wealth and power were best served by increasing exports, in an effort to collect precious metals like gold and silver. Mercantilism replaced the feudal economic system in Western Europe.</p>
<h2 id=was-mercantilism-the-basis-for-european-settlement-in-north-america>Was mercantilism the basis for European settlement in North America?</h2>
<p>In the context of the European colonization of North America, mercantilism refers to the idea that colonies existed for the benefit of the Mother Country. In other words, the British saw the American colonists as tenants who ‘paid rent’ by providing materials for Britain to use.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-theory-of-mercantilism-lead-to-european-exploration-and-colonization>How did the theory of mercantilism lead to European exploration and colonization?</h2>
<p>Mercantilism became popular in Europe in the 1500s and was the primary reason behind Europe’s desire to colonize new lands. The theory of mercantilism states that there is a certain amount of wealth in the world and that it is in a nation’s best interest to accumulate it. Through wealth, a nation can achieve power.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-concept-of-european-mercantilism-during-the-age-of-exploration>What was the concept of European mercantilism during the Age of Exploration?</h2>
<p>During the European Age of Exploration, the nations of Europe adopted a new economic policy called mercantilism. The theory of mercantilism (shown above) held that a country’s power depended mainly on its wealth. Wealth, after all, allowed nations to build strong navies and purchase vital goods.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-a-major-result-of-mercantilism>What was a major result of mercantilism?</h2>
<p>What were the effects of mercantilism? Mercantilism led to the creation of monopolistic trading companies, such as the East India Company and the French East India Company. Restrictions on where finished goods could be purchased led in many cases to burdensome high prices for those goods.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-mercantilism-on-the-economy>What was the impact of mercantilism on the economy?</h2>
<p>Because you get more money coming in than you have coming out! Mercantilism is no longer embraced in economics. But its effects on history have been enormous. European countries used the theory to justify their colonization of the new world. Mercantilism established the idea that the government should actively regulate the economy.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-mercantilism-considered-a-precursor-to-capitalism>Why is mercantilism considered a precursor to capitalism?</h2>
<p>Mercantilism is considered by some scholars to be a precursor to capitalism since it rationalized economic activity such as profits and losses.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-four-basic-principles-of-mercantilism>What are the four basic principles of mercantilism?</h2>
<p>While there are several different versions enacted, there are four basic economic principles or rules of mercantilism. A country becomes rich and powerful by collecting as much gold and silver as possible. A country becomes rich and powerful by increasing the number of colonies it has.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-mercantilists-measure-the-health-of-a-nation>How did mercantilists measure the health of a nation?</h2>
<p>Mercantilists also believed that a nation’s economic health could be assessed by its levels of ownership of precious metals, like gold or silver, which tended to rise with increased new home construction, increased agricultural output, and a strong merchant fleet to provide additional markets with goods and raw materials.</p>
