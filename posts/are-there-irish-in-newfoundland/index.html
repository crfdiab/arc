<h2 id=are-there-irish-in-newfoundland>Are there Irish in Newfoundland?</h2>
<p>There are a number of places in the province where Irish connections run deep. Located on the southeastern part of the Avalon Peninsula, the Irish Loop is the heart of Irish culture and heritage in Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-irish-move-to-newfoundland>Why did the Irish move to Newfoundland?</h2>
<p>Seasonal and Temporary Migrations. Newfoundland and Labrador’s cod fishery was the strongest pull factor attracting Irish immigrants from the late-17th through early-19th centuries because it provided a readily available source of employment for unskilled workers.</p>
<h2 id=is-ireland-further-north-than-newfoundland>Is Ireland further north than Newfoundland?</h2>
<p>And England and Ireland are farther north than even Newfoundland. Much of the southern United States, starting with North Carolina, is on the same latitude as Africa. You could follow lines of latitude east around the globe, or you could follow them west.</p>
<h2 id=is-st-johns-newfoundland-irish>Is St John’s Newfoundland Irish?</h2>
<p>The first Irish immigrants who settled on the Eastern shore centuries ago continue to play an influential role in Newfoundland’s culture. St. John’s has even been chosen to be a twinned city with Waterford, Ireland. But that’s not the only twinning that connects us, we also have a matched national park.</p>
<h2 id=what-nationality-are-newfoundlanders>What nationality are Newfoundlanders?</h2>
<p>English and Irish Immigrants A large majority of the present-day inhabitants of Newfoundland and Labrador are the descendants of people who migrated here from relatively small areas of southwestern England and southeastern Ireland between the mid-17th century and the mid-19th century.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-irish-in-newfoundland>Why are there so many Irish in Newfoundland?</h2>
<p>There were probably more Catholic Irish concentrated in this relatively restricted stretch of shore than in any comparable Canadian space. It was the outcome of a long and complicated process. When the Irish came to Newfoundland many settled in St. John’s and its near hinterland.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-population-of-newfoundland-and-labrador>How big is the population of Newfoundland and Labrador?</h2>
<p>Starting from about 20 000 settlers in 1760, the population grew by natural expansion to ∼200 000 in 1890 (Newfoundland Studies Archives). The present population of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador is 512 930, with 98% of English or Irish descent (Statistics Canada, 2001 and Newfoundland Study Archives).</p>
<h2 id=is-it-easy-to-get-to-newfoundland-from-canada>Is it easy to get to Newfoundland from Canada?</h2>
<p>Located on the easternmost tip of North America, Newfoundland isn’t the easiest destination to reach in Canada but one of the most rewarding. While planning your Newfoundland itinerary, it’s important to remember that Newfoundland and Labrador is a BIG province.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-newfoundland-and-labrador-become-a-colony>When did Newfoundland and Labrador become a colony?</h2>
<p>But life in the outports was to change forever in 1949. That was the year Newfoundland and Labrador, Great Britain’s first permanent colony, voted to join Canada. Following confederation, the government began to take a keen interest in these hundreds of isolated communities.</p>
