<h2 id=how-big-are-families-in-new-zealand>How big are families in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Household size varying across the country The average number of people per New Zealand household is 2.7 people, which has remained unchanged since 2006.</p>
<h2 id=who-owns-the-most-property-in-nz>Who owns the most property in NZ?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-family-life-like-in-new-zealand>What is family life like in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>The average New Zealand family is a nuclear family with their extended family living separately. However, today the archetypical family (husband, wife and children) can no longer be an exact social expectation. Due to widespread divorce and remarriage, many families include step-parents and step-siblings.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-family-called-in-new-zealand>What is family called in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Whānau<br>
Whānau is often translated as ‘family’, but its meaning is more complex. It includes physical, emotional and spiritual dimensions and is based on whakapapa. Whānau can be multi-layered, flexible and dynamic. Whānau is based on a Māori and a tribal world view.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-say-hello-family-in-nz>How do you say hello family in NZ?</h2>
<p>Kia ora (Māori: [kia ɔɾa], approximated in English as /ˌkiːə ˈɔːrə/ KEE-ə OR-ə) is a Māori-language greeting which has entered New Zealand English.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-richest-people-in-new-zealand>Who are the richest people in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Michael Spencer (35,942 hectares): Part of the wider Spencer family, one of New Zealand’s wealthiest families. Spencer’s properties include Lochinver Station, which he bought after a highly-publicised bid from a Chinese company, Shanghai Pengxin, was rejected by the government.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-families-different-in-new-zealand-today>How are families different in New Zealand today?</h2>
<p>The article first considers New Zealand families today and includes projections looking forward. The different experiences of family over the last 60 years will then be presented through the lens of three generations of New Zealand families. The story that emerges is one of increasing diversity and change.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-famous-people-in-new-zealand>Who are the famous people in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>In keeping with their role as one of New Zealand’s largest industrialist families, the Henry’s became philanthropists. Their focus on charity and giving reflected their Presbyterian faith. This continues in different guises. The most well known member of the family is Sir David Henry KBE.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-we-define-family-in-immigration-new-zealand>How do we define family in Immigration New Zealand?</h2>
<p>How we define family. Immigration New Zealand defines family in a specific way, which may be different from how you define family in your country. A partner is a person you are legally married to, or in a civil union or de facto relationship with, and who you live with in a genuine and stable partnership.</p>
