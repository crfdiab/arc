<h2 id=when-should-you-start-planning-for-retirement>When should you start planning for retirement?</h2>
<p>The answer is simple: as soon as you can. Ideally, you’d start saving in your 20s, when you first leave school and begin earning paychecks. That’s because the sooner you begin saving, the more time your money has to grow.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-better-to-retire-at-the-end-of-the-year-or-the-beginning-of-the-year>Is it better to retire at the end of the year or the beginning of the year?</h2>
<p>By retiring at the beginning of a year you will receive your leave payout in a year of potentially less income, thus minimizing the taxation of the payout. If you retire super-close to the last day of a year (December 31st) you will not receive your annual leave payout until the following year.</p>
<h2 id=when-should-you-start-planning-your-financial-future-and-retirement>When should you start planning your financial future and retirement?</h2>
<p>While starting early is always important – even $25 a month in your 20s is helpful – it’s OK to set money aside for more immediate needs first and then start tackling retirement in your late 30s and early 40s.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-will-800k-last-in-retirement>How long will 800k last in retirement?</h2>
<p>How long will savings of $800,000 last? When will $800k run out? Your savings will last for 12 years and 8 months.</p>
<h2 id=what-retirees-do-all-day>What retirees do all day?</h2>
<p>What Retirees Do All Day</p>
<ul>

<li>Watch TV. Americans watch an average of two hours and 45 minutes of TV per day.</li>
<li>Sleep.</li>
<li>Household chores.</li>
<li>Eat and drink.</li>
<li>Work.</li>
<li>Shop.</li>
<li>Volunteer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=how-long-does-retirement-process-take>How long does retirement process take?</h2>
<p>How long will it take to process my federal retirement application? It takes around 60 days (2 months) to process applications for common cases.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-of-year-to-retire>When is the best time of year to retire?</h2>
<p>Some people without access to ample cash reserves might plan to pull money from retirement accounts soon after stopping work, however. For such workers, the best time to retire might be at the very beginning or very end of the year.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-better-to-start-saving-for-retirement-sooner-or-later>Is it better to start saving for retirement sooner or later?</h2>
<p>Starting earlier means more time for your savings to benefit from the effects of compounding returns. Conversely, the longer you wait, the less time you have for your money to grow and the harder you’ll have to work to reach your retirement goals.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-start-planning-for-retirement-early>Why is it important to start planning for retirement early?</h2>
<p>Planning ahead allows you to better enjoy your retirement. Starting early gives you more time to reap the benefits of compounding interest. Inflation has a big effect on cost of living in the future.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-normal-age-to-retire-in-the-united-states>What’s the normal age to retire in the United States?</h2>
<p>Normal Retirement: Ages 66 to 70. For many, the upper 60s is the golden mean of retirement timing—you’re old enough to have built up a nice financial reserve and young enough to enjoy your job-free years.</p>
