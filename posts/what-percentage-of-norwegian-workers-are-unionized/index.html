<h2 id=what-percentage-of-norwegian-workers-are-unionized>What percentage of Norwegian workers are unionized?</h2>
<p>Trade unions in Norway</p>
<table><tr><td>National organization(s)</td><td>LO-Norway, Unio, YS, Akademikerne</td></tr><tr><td>Total union membership</td><td>1.9 million (2019)</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>49.2% (2018)</td></tr><tr><td>CBA coverage</td><td>72.5% (2014)</td></tr><tr><th>Global Rights Index</th></tr></table>
<h2 id=does-norway-have-labor-unions>Does Norway have labor unions?</h2>
<p>In Norway, trade unions have a greater influence on employment than in most other countries. A huge proportion of employees become members, and the trade unions enter into collective bargaining agreements with employers, which are then binding for all employees.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-national-trade-union-organization-lo-formed>When was the national trade union organization LO formed?</h2>
<p>Fagforbundet was established in June, 2003 by a merger of two trade unions: The Norwegian Union of Municipal Employees (Norsk Kommuneforbund) of 1920 and The Norwegian Association of Health and Care Personnel (Norsk Helse og Sosialforbund) of 1965.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-unions-work-in-norway>How do unions work in Norway?</h2>
<p>On behalf of their members, unions in Norway can negotiate everything from higher salaries, across legal employment disputes, to better working conditions. Unions can act on local and/or national levels. Most smaller unions in Norway are affiliated with larger union confederations.</p>

<h2 id=which-country-has-the-highest-level-of-union-membership>Which country has the highest level of union membership?</h2>
<p>Iceland<br>
Union density varies considerably between countries and Iceland had the highest rate of membership in 2018 at 90.4 percent, according to the most recent international comparison by the OECD. The Icelandic Confederation of Labour alone has 104,500 members, accounting for about half of the country’s employees.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-the-private-workforce-is-unionized>What percentage of the private workforce is unionized?</h2>
<p>6.3 percent<br>
The unionization rate for private-sector workers increased by 0.1 percentage point to 6.3 percent in 2020, reflecting the net effect of declines in both the number of union members in the private sector and the steep drop in private- sector employment.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-high-salary-in-norway>What is a high salary in Norway?</h2>
<p>For a single family generally 30–45,000 NOK per month (pretax) is considered as good salary. Remember the taxation in Norway is way too high, and the country is expensive too. A good salary (gross; namely before tax) would be around one million kroner per year.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-industrialization-of-norway-start-and-end>When did the industrialization of Norway start and end?</h2>
<p>Industrialization started in the 1840s and from the 1860s large-scale emigration to North America took place. In 1884 the king appointed Johan Sverdrup as prime minister, thus establishing parliamentarism. The union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-european-shipbuilding-industry-begin-to-decline>When did the European shipbuilding industry begin to decline?</h2>
<p>The market share of European ship builders began to decline in the 1960s as they lost work to Japan in the same way Japan most recently lost their work to China and South Korea. Over the four years from 2007, the total number of employees in the European shipbuilding industry declined from 150,000 to 115,000.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-norway-become-part-of-the-hanseatic-league>When did Norway become part of the Hanseatic League?</h2>
<p>Bergen became the main trading port, controlled by the Hanseatic League. Norway entered the Kalmar Union with Denmark and Sweden in 1397. After Sweden left the union in 1523, Norway became the junior partner in Denmark–Norway.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-construction-industry-decline-after-the-housing-boom>Why did the construction industry decline after the housing boom?</h2>
<p>Another reason construction firms may have trouble finding skilled workers today is that hiring of young workers in the industry declined after the housing boom. Overall, hires of workers less than 45 years old fell from 73% of construction hires in 2000 to 63% in 2011.</p>
