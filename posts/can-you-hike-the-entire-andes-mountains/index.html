<h2 id=can-you-hike-the-entire-andes-mountains>Can you hike the entire Andes mountains?</h2>
<p>The highest peak of all the climbs in the Andes and the highest in South America,and indeed the highest mountain in the world outside the Himalayas is Mount Aconcagua in Argentina. We offer guided climbs on both major routes of this peak, and the main season is from December to the end of February.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-hike-the-andes-mountains>How long does it take to hike the Andes Mountains?</h2>
<p>The trail itself is breathtaking, but the end of the trail is a spectacular sight as you reach the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu at sunrise. The classic Inca trail runs 26 miles (42 km) long, is usually hiked over 4 days and 3 nights and is tucked away in the beautiful Andes mountains in Peru.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-hike-like-to-machu-picchu>What is the hike like to Machu Picchu?</h2>
<p>The Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu is a longer and more difficult route than the classic Inca Trail but, because it does not require a guide or a permit, it is quickly becoming a popular alternative. Typically completed in four days, the 38-mile route can be modified in distance with car and train assistance.</p>
<h2 id=when-can-you-hike-huayhuash>When can you hike huayhuash?</h2>
<p>The best months to hike the Cordillera Huayhuash are May through September when the weather is dry but cold (during the wet season there can be snow which blocks the mountain passes).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-highest-peak-in-the-andes-mountains>What is the highest peak in the Andes mountains?</h2>
<p>Aconcagua<br>
Andes/Highest point</p>
<p>Aconcagua is the highest peak in the Western Hemisphere. It is more than 6,706 meters (22,000 feet) high, though the exact height of its highest peak has been the subject of some debate. Aconcagua is part of the Andes Mountains chain.</p>

<h2 id=capilla-de-piedra-de-juan-felix-sanchez-what-natural-resources-can-be-extracted-from-the-andes>Capilla de Piedra de Juan Felix Sanchez. What natural resources can be extracted from the Andes?</h2>
<p>The Andes are rich in natural resources, such as gold, silver, iron ore, gas, coal, tin, copper and nitrates. This is Yanacocha, the largest gold mine in the Andes and in the world.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-best-places-to-hike-in-the-andes>Where are the best places to hike in the Andes?</h2>
<p>Home to the legendary Machu Picchu in Peru, the Ulyuni Salt Flats in Bolivia, and an abundance of hiking trails with views that take your breath away, the Andes should be at the top of your bucket list. “This was overall a good introduction to the Patagonia area.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-wear-when-trekking-in-the-andes>What to wear when trekking in the Andes?</h2>
<p>Get good quality trekking boots and socks. Break them in before you go so that they are comfortable, as you don’t want to suffer blisters in remote areas and with the only exit available on foot. Wearing one thick pair of socks and a thin inner pair can help reduce risk of blisters too.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-acclimate-to-altitude-in-the-andes>How to acclimate to altitude in the Andes?</h2>
<p>Fitness does not equal acclimatised. Being at altitude, especially in the tropics, is usually a pleasure as it isn’t so hot, there are few insects and the air is clear. Rest for a few hours on arrival at altitude and take it easy for the first couple of days.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-good-trek-in-south-america>What makes a good trek in South America?</h2>
<p>Many of South America’s best treks involve being at altitude for extended periods of time. Acclimatising properly before the trek is as important as being fit for the trek. Fitness does not equal acclimatised. Being at altitude, especially in the tropics, is usually a pleasure as it isn’t so hot, there are few insects and the air is clear.</p>
