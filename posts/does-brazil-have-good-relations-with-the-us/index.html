<h2 id=does-brazil-have-good-relations-with-the-us>Does Brazil have good relations with the US?</h2>
<p>U.S.-BRAZIL RELATIONS The United States and Brazil enjoy robust political and economic relations. The United States was the first country to recognize Brazil’s independence in 1822.</p>
<h2 id=does-brazil-have-a-high-quality-of-life>Does Brazil have a high quality of life?</h2>
<p>Brazil ranks above the average in civic engagement and social connections, but below average in education and skills, personal security, income and wealth, jobs and earnings, housing, environmental quality, subjective well-being work-life balance and health status.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-i-prefer-living-in-brazil-vs-the-us>Why do I prefer living in Brazil vs the US?</h2>
<p>While Brazil might not have the same material abundance that the US has, at the end of the day what matters most in life is people. What good does it do you to have 40 different options for lunch if you’re going to be seated at a table with people who are more focused on the devices in their hands than the people around them?</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-brazil-different-from-other-countries-in-the-world>What makes Brazil different from other countries in the world?</h2>
<p>It’s a key part of the Brazilian personality: a willingness to laugh at themselves, their predicaments and political absurdities and to welcome others in on the joke. A few years back, Brazilians voted a clown into Congress. What was unusual was that he was a real clown by profession.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-a-lot-of-nice-people-in-brazil>Are there a lot of Nice People in Brazil?</h2>
<p>And yes, Brazil is on our hit-list, pursuant their participation in BRICS. So no, there isn’t “nice people everywhere” because being nice entails more than just saying hi or getting a blow job. You don’t have a fucking clue about what goes on in the US, where over 95% of the income goes to the top 1% of the earners.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-food-in-brazil-compared-to-the-us>How big is the food in Brazil compared to the US?</h2>
<p>Brazilian portions can be gigantic, often larger than even the standard American plateful. It’s not a miscommunication when your waiter brings you enough food for twice your number. A light breakfast is advised, since you’ll consume a lot more than you thought for lunch.</p>
