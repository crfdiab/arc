<h2 id=how-did-castles-come-to-england>How did castles come to England?</h2>
<p>The presence of castles in Britain and Ireland dates primarily from the Norman invasion of 1066. Before the arrival of the Normans the Anglo-Saxons had built burhs, fortified structures with their origins in 9th-century Wessex.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-castles-did-william-built-in-england>How many castles did William built in England?</h2>
<p>William ordered many more built as the Norman conquerors moved to suppress and control more and more areas of the country. In fact, there were at least 84 Norman castles in England by the time of the Conqueror’s death in 1087.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-king-william-bring-to-england>What did King William bring to England?</h2>
<p>The laws introduced by William the Conqueror after his victory at Hastings in 1066, had an impact on everybody in England. These laws were introduced by William to control the English. Along with the building of castles and the Domesday Book, these laws were part of William’s way of controlling the English population.</p>
<h2 id=how-william-used-castles-to-control-england>How William used castles to control England?</h2>
<p>The first castles were called motte and bailey castles. The barons and their soldiers used the castle as a base to control the local area, trade and collect taxes. Wooden motte and bailey castles helped William to quickly control the English BUT they burned easily and they rotted. Later castles were built from stone.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-normans-invade-england>Why did the Normans invade England?</h2>
<p>The Normans invaded England in 1066 because they wanted to have Norman king in England after the Anglo-Saxon king died. While the Normans planned their invasion, the Vikings were also interested in taking over England – they were led by Viking King Harald Hardrada.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-william-the-conqueror-when-he-invaded-england>How old was William the Conqueror when he invaded England?</h2>
<p>At the age of eight, William the Conqueror became duke of Normandy and later King of England. Violence plagued his early reign, but with the help of King Henry I of France, William managed to survive the early years. After the Battle of Hastings, in 1066, he was crowned king of England.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-windsor-castle-uk>How old is Windsor Castle UK?</h2>
<p>951c. 1070<br>
Windsor Castle/Age</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-normans-build-castles-in-england>Why did the Normans build castles in England?</h2>
<p>The new Norman landowners built castles to defend themselves against the Saxons they had conquered. This gave them great power, and enabled some of them to rebel against William in the late 1070s. William reorganised the church in England.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-build-a-castle>Who was the first person to build a castle?</h2>
<p>Originally, it was a wooden motte-and-bailey-type castle built by William I as the first in a series of nine castles. Later it was renovated with stones and was given a few additions by way of some outer walls and a round tower by a generous Henry II.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-castles-on-a-british-itinerary>Are there any castles on a British Itinerary?</h2>
<p>Most visitor itineraries include a castle or two – Britain is crawling with them. But did you know the most British of castles in England, Scotland and Wales were really French inventions?</p>
<h2 id=how-did-william-come-to-power-in-england>How did William come to power in England?</h2>
<p>How did William come to power in England? At the Battle of Hastings on October 14, 1066, William, duke of Normandy, defeated the forces of Harold II, king of England, and then was himself crowned king as William I, leading to profound political, administrative, and social changes in the British Isles as result of the Norman Conquest.</p>
