<h2 id=how-did-they-refrigerate-food-in-the-old-days>How did they refrigerate food in the old days?</h2>
<p>People did preserve their foods via pickling or salting, yet the most practical (if it could be afforded) was the ice box in areas that could sustain it. Before that was available, people had cool cellars and some had ice houses where ice could be stored (under sawdust, often) and kept cool for much of the year.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-ice-made-before-refrigeration-in-australia>How was ice made before refrigeration in Australia?</h2>
<p>Sydney-made ice was available as early as 1848. ‘Robinson’s celebrated freezing machine’, patented by Thomas Masters in 1843, used the heat absorption of a chemical mixture to create ice, but required new chemicals each time ice was made.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-keep-food-cold-in-the-past>How did people keep food cold in the past?</h2>
<p>How did people keep food and drinks cool? Natural sources such as streams and caves were a great cooling option. At various points in time ice houses were built often underground or as insulated buildings – these were used to store ice and snow sourced during winter, to keep foods cold during the warmer months.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-british-change-australias-eating-habits>How did the British change Australia’s eating habits?</h2>
<p>British and Irish food habits heavily influenced early Australian cuisine until the 1950s, and for most Australians it reminded them of ‘home’. Our meat-and-three-vegetable dinner regime, hearty puddings and fondness for tea and beer came from our Anglo-Celtic forebears.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-they-keep-food-cold-in-the-1500s>How did they keep food cold in the 1500s?</h2>
<p>Freezing and Cooling In castles and large homes with cellars, an underground room could be used to keep foods packed in winter ice through the cooler spring months and into the summer. More common was the use of underground rooms to keep foods cool, the all-important last step of most of the above preservation methods.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-they-keep-meat-before-refrigeration>How did they keep meat before refrigeration?</h2>
<p>Meat could be stored in the brine and packed tightly in covered jars or casks in a cool environment for months. The Washingtons had cellars in their house ideal for this purpose and the archaeological record at Ferry Farm is full of fragments of stoneware and earthenware jars – the Tupperware of their day.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-they-keep-food-cold-in-the-1900s>How did they keep food cold in the 1900s?</h2>
<p>By the end of the 1800s, many American households stored their perishable food in an insulated “icebox” that was usually made of wood and lined with tin or zinc. A large block of ice was stored inside to keep these early refrigerators chilly.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-they-keep-ice-from-melting-in-the-old-days>How did they keep ice from melting in the old days?</h2>
<p>As Allen Jones points out, ice was harvested from frozen lakes and stored in well-insulated “ice houses.” Blocks would be separated by a layer of sawdust to prevent the blocks from fusing. The ice houses could keep the ice frozen until the following Winter.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-medieval-people-dry-meat>How did medieval people dry meat?</h2>
<p>The meat during the Middle Ages was preserved in salt. Dry-salting where the meat or fish was buried in salt and brine-curing where meat was soaked in salt water. Each year households prepared tubs of a thick saline bath and undertook to preserve fresh meats for the coming winter.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-they-keep-water-cold>How did they keep water cold?</h2>
<p>Ice was cut from lakes and streams in winter and stored, usually underground. In summer, it was delivered to “ice boxes” to provide cooler temperatures to help keep food from spoiling too quickly. If you were rich enough, you could use that ice to cool water for drinking.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-food-kept-cool-in-the-early-1900s>How was food kept cool in the early 1900s?</h2>
<p>In houses on our working class housing estate in the early 1900s, non-perishable food was kept in a dresser in the kitchen. Perishable foods though were a different matter, as there were no fridges when I was a child. So my mother always had to take steps in the summer to keep perishable food in good condition.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-do-to-preserve-food-before-refrigerators>What did people do to preserve food before refrigerators?</h2>
<p>Today, people dry fruits and vegetables and smoke-cure meats to create jerky. Early methods of cooling food to preserve it included freezing food in lakes during winter, keeping food in cool caves or cellars and submerging it in cold streams.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-keep-food-cool-in-caves>How did people keep food cool in caves?</h2>
<p>Those who had caves on their property would use them for food storage. But even people who didn’t have a cave would take advantage of things being cooler underground, if they had a well. Pitchers of milk, cheese, sides of meat and other foods could be kept cool, helping them to last longer.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-they-store-food-to-keep-it-cool>Where did they store food to keep it cool?</h2>
<p>And the history of storing food by keeping it chilled goes hand in hand with the evolution of what and how Americans eat—a concept we’ll explore in the Patrick F. Taylor Foundation Object Project, opening in July. Early cold storage systems in America were located not in kitchens, but underground.</p>
