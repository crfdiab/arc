<h2 id=how-did-great-britain-respond-to-the-continental-system>How did Great Britain respond to the continental system?</h2>
<p>England responded to the Continental System with Orders in Council that subjected France and all countries in alliance with Napoleon to a counterblockade. These orders were one of the main causes of the Anglo-American War of 1812.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-napoleons-decision-to-block-british-trade-from-the-rest-of-europe-cause-conflict-on-the-european-front>How did Napoleon’s decision to block British trade from the rest of Europe cause conflict on the European front?</h2>
<p>As a response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government in 1806, Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree, which brought into effect a large-scale embargo against British trade that banned trade between Britain and states occupied by or allied with France.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-blockade-of-britain-the-peninsular-war-and-the-invasion-of-russia-lead-to-for-napoleon>What did the blockade of Britain the Peninsular War and the invasion of Russia lead to for Napoleon?</h2>
<p>The blockade caused little economic damage to the UK, although British exports to the continent (as a proportion of the UK’s total trade) dropped from 55% to 25% between 1802 and 1806. As Napoleon realized that extensive trade was going through Spain and Russia, he invaded those two countries.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-napoleon-implement-the-continental-system>Why did Napoleon implement the continental system?</h2>
<p>Napoleon wanted to hobble the British economy and give France a chance to build up its own manufacturing and industry. The Continental System began in 1806 with Napoleon’s Berlin Decree, which banned British ships from entering European ports.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-napoleons-mistakes-and-what-were-their-outcomes>What were Napoleon’s mistakes and what were their outcomes?</h2>

<h2 id=how-did-great-britain-combat-napoleons-naval-blockade>How did Great Britain combat Napoleon’s naval blockade?</h2>

<h2 id=how-did-the-british-respond-to-the-blockade>How did the British respond to the blockade?</h2>
<p>The British Attack on Denmark. One of the first British responses to the blockade was an attack on Denmark in 1807. At Copenhagen, the British bombarded the city and seized the Danish fleet, depriving Napoleon of the opportunity to add it to his own naval power. It was an appalling attack in which thousands of civilians died.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-refuse-to-negotiate-with-napoleon>Why did the British refuse to negotiate with Napoleon?</h2>
<p>The British were determined to uphold their position of global dominance, and would not negotiate with Napoleon. British governments under Portland and Pitt refused to come to the table, digging in their heels to fight against an infringement upon British liberties.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-napoleons-blockade-called-the-continental-system>Why was Napoleon’s blockade called the Continental System?</h2>
