<h2 id=what-did-europe-trade-in-the-1500s>What did Europe trade in the 1500s?</h2>
<p>As well as spices and tea, they included silks, cottons, porcelains and other luxury goods. Since few European products could be successfully sold in bulk in Asian markets, these imports were paid for with silver. The resulting currency drain encouraged Europeans to imitate the goods they so admired.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-economic-strategy-for-european-countries-in-the-17th-century-what-impact-did-that-have>What was the main economic strategy for European countries in the 17th century what impact did that have?</h2>
<p>In 17th-century Europe, early capitalism allowed the lower classes to better themselves through education and hard work. The Protestant Reformation helped bring about the emergence of capitalism by emphasizing the value of hard work and the blessing of material wealth.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-economic-policies-in-the-16th-century-europe>What were the economic policies in the 16th century Europe?</h2>
<p>Mercantilism was an economic system of trade that spanned from the 16th century to the 18th century. Mercantilism was based on the idea that a nation’s wealth and power were best served by increasing exports and so involved increasing trade.</p>
<h2 id=what-changes-occurred-in-trade-during-the-eighteenth-century>What changes occurred in trade during the eighteenth century?</h2>
<p>THE TRIANGULAR TRADE​ Monarchs increased domestic trade by improving roads and building new ones. They also built canals to connect river systems and modernised ports. International trade grew due to increased exchanges of goods between Europe and the American colonies.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-european-merchants-want-to-get-rid-of-the-middle-man>Why did the European merchants want to get rid of the middle man?</h2>
<p>Europeans outside Italy wanted their own direct access to Asia’s trade goods. They wanted to cut out the middle man and obtain spices directly from the source. He also hoped to find a way to reach Asia by sailing along the coast of Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-economy-depend-on-during-the-dark-ages-in-the-west>What did the economy depend on during the Dark Ages in the West?</h2>
<p>The foundation of the economy of the city at the time was agricultural. Besides standard crops, Rome’s agricultural products also included cloth and raw materials (like olives for oil and vineyards for wine).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-netherlands-become-rich>How did Netherlands become rich?</h2>
<p>A technological revolution in shipbuilding and trade knowledge and capital, due to Protestant traders of Flanders who fled to the Netherlands, helped the young Republic become the dominant trade power by the mid-17th century. Still the Netherlands kept a high level of prosperity, due to trade and agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-modern-age-begin-in-europe>Why did the modern age begin in Europe?</h2>
<p>Some of the more notable trends and events of the early modern period included the Reformation and the religious conflicts it provoked (including the French Wars of Religion and the Thirty Years’ War), the rise of capitalism and modern nation states, widespread witch hunts and European colonization of the Americas.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-world-like-in-the-1500s>What was the world like in the 1500s?</h2>
<p>In the 1500s and 1600s almost 90% of Europeans lived on farms or small rural communities. Crop failure and disease was a constant threat to life. Wheat bread was the favorite staple, but most peasants lived on Rye and Barley in the form of bread and beer. These grains were cheaper and higher yield, though less tasty.</p>
<h2 id=which-two-powers-dominated-global-trade-in-the-eighteenth-century>Which two powers dominated global trade in the eighteenth century?</h2>
<p>Most of the states that set up a balance of trade administration throughout the eighteenth century were motivated by mercantilist objectives. This is self evident in the cases of England and France, the two great economic powers of the time; but Portugal, Prussia, Spain, Sweden and others also emulated these examples.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-europes-economy-change>How did Europe’s economy change?</h2>
<p>During the Renaissance, the European economy grew dramatically, particularly in the area of trade. Developments such as population growth, improvements in banking, expanding trade routes, and new manufacturing systems led to an overall increase in commercial activity.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-trade-take-place-between-africa-and-eurasia>Where did trade take place between Africa and Eurasia?</h2>
<p>By 1450, these trade routes went through West Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Indian Ocean. One factor that stayed the same during this time period was that the northern coast of Africa was always involved in the trade between Africa and the rest of Eurasia.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-trade-between-europe-and-asia-change>How did trade between Europe and Asia change?</h2>
<p>However, the only parts of the trade that were affected were the northern parts between Europe and Asia, because the Mongols concentrated on mostly China, Russia, and some parts of Eastern Europe. By the 1450s, the gold-salt trade started to decline, and soon, the center of trade started to shift away from the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-afro-eurasia-divided-into-europe-and-asia>How is Afro Eurasia divided into Europe and Asia?</h2>
<p>Normally Afro-Eurasia is divided at the Suez Canal into Africa and Eurasia, the latter of which can be subdivided into Europe and Asia. It has also been divided into Eurasia–North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa for cultural and historical reasons.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-people-migrate-from-africa-to-other-parts-of-the-world>When did people migrate from Africa to other parts of the world?</h2>
<p>Humans begin to migrate from Africa to other parts of the world 8500 BC – 6500 BC In the Sahara Desert region, the people develop the use of pottery and use it for tools and dishes. 6000 BC</p>
