<h2 id=does-germany-have-a-stable-economy>Does Germany have a stable economy?</h2>
<p>Along with its relative economic stability, Germany is the largest domestic market within Europe, creating a large and stable customer base for investors. Germany’s integration into the world economy also allows companies to gain and share knowledge, products and employees within a global network.</p>

<h2 id=does-germany-have-stable-growth>Does Germany have stable growth?</h2>
<p>Germany’s economy is expected to produce $4.2 trillion1 in 2019 as measured by nominal gross domestic product. Some say that Germany has been flourishing over the past 12 years, as Chancellor Angela Merkel has led the country to robust economic growth and record low unemployment rates.</p>
<h2 id=does-germany-have-the-strongest-economy-in-europe>Does Germany have the strongest economy in Europe?</h2>
<p>Germany’s economy has consistently had the largest economy in Europe since 1980, even before the reunification of West and East Germany. The Spanish economy was continually the fifth-largest in Europe in this 38-year period, and from 2004 onwards has been worth more than one trillion Euros.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-germany-have-more-stability-than-other-countries>Why does Germany have more stability than other countries?</h2>
<p>Geopolitically, the EU risks being squeezed between an unpredictable US and a rising China. But Germany’s government keeps bickering about small beer. Stability is better than chaos and strife. But if it becomes complacency and stagnation, it holds a country back.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-germany-have-so-little-political-instability>Why did Germany have so little political instability?</h2>
<p>“Because of Hitler, the palette of contemporary German political rhetoric is deliberately narrow, cautious and boring,” thinks Timothy Garton Ash, a British historian who’s been watching Germany for decades.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-political-system-does-germany-have>What kind of political system does Germany have?</h2>
<p>Germany is a Federal democracy, with strong political parties, an independent judiciary, and powerful regional and local governments. As such, things can get a little confusing – even for native citizens. The “Federal” part refers to the way that power is divided nationally.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-be-a-german-citizen-to-understand-german-politics>Do you have to be a German citizen to understand German politics?</h2>
<p>When you move to Germany, getting to grips with how politics works is absolutely essential, especially for those who choose to become German citizens, but even foreign students need a little grounding in how power operates.</p>
