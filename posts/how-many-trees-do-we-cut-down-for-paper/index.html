<h2 id=how-many-trees-do-we-cut-down-for-paper>How many trees do we cut down for paper?</h2>
<p>Upwards of 15 billion trees are cut down each year in the world, and much of the paper created from these trees are going towards books and textbooks. Stats: On average, one textbook contains around 700 pages. One tree can produce about 8,333 sheets of paper.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-are-used-to-make-paper-each-year-worldwide>How many trees are used to make paper each year worldwide?</h2>
<p>Cutting down paper waste along with all other waste is a major issue. Out of the 17 billion cubic feet of trees deforested each year, over 60% are used to make paper. This deforestation is responsible for nearly a fifth of the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-do-they-cut-down-each-day>How many trees do they cut down each day?</h2>
<p>Throughout the world, about 900 million trees are cut down annually. This equates to about 2.47 million trees cut down every day.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-are-cut-to-make-paper>How many trees are cut to make paper?</h2>
<p>This means that over two million trees are felled every day for global paper consumption, meaning four billion trees are cut every year to serve our paper needs. When you consider this, it makes you question whether that document is really worth printing.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-are-cut-down-every-year>How many trees are cut down every year?</h2>
<p>That means every year we cut down about 1 tree for every person alive on the planet. That makes the number in the 20–30 million per day range. How many trees are cut down every year?</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-does-it-take-to-make-one-ton-of-newsprint>How many trees does it take to make one ton of newsprint?</h2>
<p>According to Conserveatree.org, it takes between 8 and 15 trees to make one ton of newsprint or magazine paper. In addition, The American Forest and Paper Association shares The World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers’ report that 2.5 billion people read newsprint at least once a week.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-are-saved-by-paper-towels>How many trees are saved by paper towels?</h2>
<p>So not only are trees being saved—and paper waste reduced—but the problem of plastic pollution is also being addressed. I call that a win-win-win! To make one ton of paper towels 17 trees and 20,000 gallons of water are polluted. Globally, discarded paper towels result in 254 million tons of trash every year.</p>
