<h2 id=what-drives-the-vietnam-economy>What drives the Vietnam economy?</h2>
<p>In the current period, Vietnam’s economy relies largely on foreign direct investment to attract the capital from overseas to support its continual economic rigor. Foreign investment on the luxury hotel and sector and resorts will rise to support high-end tourist industry.</p>
<h2 id=was-the-economy-good-during-the-vietnam-war>Was the economy good during the Vietnam War?</h2>
<p>U.S. gross domestic product by year reveals that the war boosted the economy out of a recession caused by the end of the Korean War in 1953. Spending on the Vietnam War played a small part in causing the Great Inflation that began in 1965. That boosted economic growth enough to reduce the level of deficit spending.</p>
<h2 id=which-sector-contributes-the-most-to-vietnam-economy>Which sector contributes the most to Vietnam economy?</h2>
<p>service sector<br>
In 2020, Vietnam’s service sector contributed the largest percentage to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), at 41.63 percent. The service sector consists of the production of intangible goods to businesses and final consumers. Approximately 35 percent of the Vietnamese population works in the service sector.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-dot-moi-reforms-improve-the-economy-of-vietnam>How did the dot moi reforms improve the economy of Vietnam?</h2>
<p>With the reforms, the number of private enterprises increased; and by 1996, there were 190 joint stock companies and 8,900 limited liability companies registered. The private sectors played an important role in the service industry, as the share in the retail trade activity increased from 41% to 76% in 1996.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-vietnam-benefit-from-globalization>How does Vietnam benefit from globalization?</h2>
<p>Globalization has helped developing countries such as Vietnam increase international trade growth and accelerate financial flows. It raised economic growth (Nguyen & Tran, 2018) and industrial development substantially (Nguyen, 2019), leading to a drastic shift of production activities to the country.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-public-support-for-the-vietnam-war>What was the public support for the Vietnam War?</h2>
<p>When the United States first sent their troops to Vietnam on March 8, 1965, many Americans supported that military effort. 61 percent of Americans said no when asked if the U.S. military intervention in Vietnam was a mistake. However, as the war dragged on, the public support began to drop while the number of skepticism started to rise.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-economy-like-in-vietnam-during-the-vietnam-war>What was the economy like in Vietnam during the Vietnam War?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the economy still dominated by small-scale production, low labor productivity and lacked of modern technology. Vietnam’s economy at that time faced an unexpected situation of stagnation and hyperinflation.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-challenge-of-economic-restructuring-in-vietnam>What was the main challenge of economic restructuring in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Successful economic restructuring has, however, also contributed to Vietnam’s primary economic challenge today, namely how to address its ‘missing middle’ — the lack of a productive domestic private sector.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-utility-fatigue-shirt-worn-in-vietnam>Why was the utility fatigue shirt worn in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>It provided good protection against the sun, insects, and other tropical hazards. The loosely fitted garments provide ventilation and moisture dissipation. The coat is worn outside of the trousers and the trousers are bloused into the boots. Jacket sleeves are rolled up or cut off. Utility Fatigue Shirt</p>
