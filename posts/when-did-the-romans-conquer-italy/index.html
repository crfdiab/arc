<p>200 BC<br>
In 500 BC, Rome was a minor city-state on the Italian peninsula. By 200 BC, the Roman Republic had conquered Italy, and over the following two centuries it conquered Greece and Spain, the North African coast, much of the Middle East, modern-day France, and even the remote island of Britain.</p>

<p>Rome’s first period of expansion included more than 200 years of almost constant warfare. During this time, Rome gradually took control of the entire Italian peninsula. After the last Etruscan king was overthrown in 509 B.C.E., the Romans began to expand their territory and influence.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-romans-take-over-southern-italy>When did the Romans take over southern Italy?</h2>
<p>753 – According to legend, Romulus founds the city of Rome. 700s – The Greeks settle much of southern Italy and Sicily. 509 – The Roman Republic is established. 334 – The Romans begin to colonize and take over much of Italy. 218 – Italy is invaded when Hannibal, leader of Carthage, crosses the Alps during the Second Punic War.</p>

<p>About the same time in the 8th century BCE, a small agricultural community was forming on the west coast of Italy. It founded the city of Rome which would grow to become one of the world’s great civilizations, Ancient Rome. For more on Ancient Rome see Ancient Rome for Kids. Rome would first form the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>In 390 BC, Celts from the north of Italy sacked Rome. In the second half of the 4th century BC Rome clashed repeatedly with the Samnites, a powerful tribal coalition of the Apennine region. By the end of these wars Rome had become the most powerful state in central Italy and began to expand to the north and to the south.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-kingdom-of-italy-capture-rome>When did the Kingdom of Italy capture Rome?</h2>
<p>The nascent Kingdom of Italy invaded and occupied Romagna (the eastern portion of the Papal States) in 1860, leaving only Latium in the Pope’s domains. Latium, including Rome itself, was annexed during the capture of Rome.</p>
