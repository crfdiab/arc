<p>Mandarin Chinese<br>
Mandarin Chinese alone is the most widely spoken native language in the world: nearly a billion within China alone and 1.2 billion worldwide—a few hundred million people more than the next most widespread languages, Spanish and English.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-chinas-secondary-language>What is China’s secondary language?</h2>
<p>As of 2008, China had helped 60,000 teachers promote its language internationally, and an estimated 40 million people were studying Chinese as a second language around the world. Other than Standard Mandarin, Cantonese is also widely taught as a foreign language.</p>
<h2 id=is-english-chinas-second-language>Is English China’s second language?</h2>
<p>In China, English is used as a lingua franca in several fields, especially for business settings, and in schools to teach Standard Mandarin to people who are not Chinese citizens. English is also one of the official languages in Hong Kong.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-second-most-widely-spoken-language-in-the-world>Which is the second most widely spoken language in the world?</h2>
<p>Chinese, which is the official language in China, Taiwan and Singapore, is second on the list, with a total of 1.1 billion speakers. Hindi completes the top three, with 650 million speakers. Both Chinese and Hindi surpass English in terms of native speakers, with native speakers accounting for only 25% of the total number of English speakers.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-widely-spoken-language-in-china>Which is the most widely spoken language in China?</h2>
<p>Korean is the 17th most widely spoken language in the world. Of course, most of those speakers are based in one of the Koreas themselves. However, a small number of Korean speakers still exist in China, primarily in the northeast, namely Jilin province, which borders North Korea.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-other-languages-besides-mandarin-in-china>Are there any other languages besides Mandarin in China?</h2>
<p>Hakka Chinese. Although Hakka is in the same language group as Mandarin, it contains more similarities to the Gan language, spoken primarily in Jiangxi province, than to Mandarin. It is spoken by the people group of the same name and is based throughout southern China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-english-the-official-language-of-china>Why is English the official language of China?</h2>
