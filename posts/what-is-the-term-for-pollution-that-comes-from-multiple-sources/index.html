<p>NPS pollution, unlike pollution from industrial and sewage treatment plants, comes from many diffuse sources. NPS pollution is caused by rainfall or snowmelt moving over and through the ground.</p>
<h2 id=are-cars-nonpoint-sources-of-pollution>Are cars nonpoint sources of pollution?</h2>
<p>Nonpoint source air pollution affects air quality, from sources such as smokestacks or car tailpipes. This runoff is often classified as a type of NPS pollution.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-water-pollution>What are the different types of water pollution?</h2>
<p>Water pollution is categorized into a point source, non-point source, and groundwater. Point source water pollution occurs when the contaminants enter a water body from a single identifiable source while non-point source occurs as a result of the cumulative effects of different amounts of contaminants.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-naturally-occurring-pollutant>Which is an example of a naturally occurring pollutant?</h2>
<p>Pollutants, the elements of pollution, can be foreign substances or energies, or naturally occurring; when naturally occurring, they are considered contaminants when they exceed natural levels. Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-description-of-point-source-pollution>Which is the best description of point source pollution?</h2>
<p>Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution. POINT SOURCE POLLUTION. A point source of pollution is a single identifiable localized source of air, water, thermal, noise or light pollution. A point source has negligible extent, distinguishing it from other pollution source geometries.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-majority-of-air-pollution-come-from>Where does the majority of air pollution come from?</h2>
<p>Types of Sources. Stationary sources, like power plants, emit large amounts of pollution from a single location, these are also known as point sources of pollution. Area sources are made up of lots of smaller pollution sources that aren’t a big deal by themselves but when considered as a group can be.</p>
