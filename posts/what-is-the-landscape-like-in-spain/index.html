<h2 id=what-is-the-landscape-like-in-spain>What is the landscape like in Spain?</h2>
<p>Most of the topography of Spain consists of flat plains that are surrounded by rugged, undeveloped hills. The northern part of the country, however, is dominated by the Pyrenees Mountains. The highest point in Spain is located in the Canary Islands on Pico de Teide at 12,198 feet (3,718 meters) above sea level.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-physical-features-of-spain>What are the physical features of Spain?</h2>
<p>Major Landforms: Spain is part of the Iberian Peninsula. Major landforms include the Andalusian Plain, Cantabrian Mountains, the Pyrenees, Maseta Central Plateau, Sistema Central Mountains, the Sierra de Guadalupe Mountains, and the Canary Islands.</p>

<p>Islantilla on the Costa De La luz has a long prom also accessible beach. 3. Re: Flat Resorts in Spain Are very good, I hope to be able to help those in need.Wish to have a pleasant journey. 4. Re: Flat Resorts in Spain Quite a lot of Spanish resorts have accessible promenades, but there are too many to name.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-average-person-in-madrid-spain>How tall is the average person in Madrid Spain?</h2>
<p>Most of, if not all, the city of Madrid is >600m and, while it certainly is not flat, I don’t think anybody would consider it mountainous. I actually live at ~720m, and IIRC the average height is ~640m. – Darkhogg Jan 19 ’16 at 8:18 You must log in to answer this question. Not the answer you’re looking for?</p>

<p>Quite a lot of Spanish resorts have accessible promenades, but there are too many to name. Perhaps you could be more specific as to where you want to go. Greenhithe, United… 5. Re: Flat Resorts in Spain I have same problem. My husband needs a mobility scooter to travel round any resort, but only needs a drop kerb to access the hotel.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-flat-resorts-in-majorca-spain>Are there any flat resorts in Majorca Spain?</h2>
<p>We have been to S’illot in Majorca which is very flat and that leads on by way of a long promenade to Ca coma, which is lovely. We want to try somewhere different, but resorts such as Benedorm are our worst nightmare. A nice flat promenade, and small town with plenty of low key cafes and bars would be great.</p>
