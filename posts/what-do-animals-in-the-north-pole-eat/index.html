<p>Many arctic herbivores have adapted to be able to eat lichen, a moss which grows on plants in the tundra. Carnivores, however, have a much wider diet, ranging from rodents such as lemmings, birds, and even caribou. When food sources are more scarce, carnivorous animals will also eat berries and eggs.</p>

<p>We all associate the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) with the Arctic region. The range of this large, white, carnivore lies largely within the boundaries of the Arctic region. The presence of seals around the region where the bear was sighted could explain how it managed to survive 550 miles away from the nearest land.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-reindeer-eat-at-the-north-pole>What do reindeer eat at the North Pole?</h2>
<p>The arctic circle is very close to the north pole, and as such, very little vegetation survives during its long, cold winters. Therefore, what do reindeers eat, depends on the season and time of year they feed. In the summer, reindeer thrive by eating grasses, plants, herbs, leaves, and forms of fungi.</p>

<p>A lone polar bear, tracks of an Arctic fox, unidentified sea creatures, and several birds have been observed at the North Pole over the years. The arctic north pole near Svalbard. The point on the Earth where the Earth’s rotational axis meets its surface is known as the Geographic North Pole.</p>

<p>1. Polar Bears Polar bears are the dominant land animal on the Arctic ice. They are also the largest of the bear family. Polar bears are gradually seeking out more and more humans, especially the Inuit who live in the area, because the bears’ hunting season is progressively shortening due to the melting polar ice.</p>
