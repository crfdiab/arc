<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-that-st-patrick-drove-the-snakes-out-of-ireland>What does it mean that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland?</h2>
<p>Serpents are a symbol of the devil in the Christian Bible, so Saint Patrick cleansed the Emerald Isle of “evil” by shooing every legless reptile he could find into the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-snakes-represent-in-the-story-of-st-patrick>What do the snakes represent in the story of St. Patrick?</h2>
<p>Patrick been so heavily hailed as the hero that banished snakes from Ireland? Well, some believe that the snake was a symbol of paganism and it is St. Paddy that can be accredited for ridding Ireland of paganism and bringing Christianity to the green isle.</p>
<h2 id=what-animal-was-driven-out-of-ireland>What animal was driven out of Ireland?</h2>
<p>snakes<br>
Patrick, the Christian missionary who supposedly rid Ireland of snakes during the fifth century A.D. According to legend, the patron saint of Ireland chased the slithering reptiles into the sea after they began attacking him during a 40-day fast he undertook on top of a hill.</p>
<h2 id=did-st-patrick-banished-snakes-from-ireland>Did St. Patrick banished snakes from Ireland?</h2>
<p>Among the legends associated with St. Patrick is that he stood atop an Irish hillside and banished snakes from Ireland—prompting all serpents to slither away into the sea. In fact, research suggests snakes never occupied the Emerald Isle in the first place. There are no signs of snakes in the country’s fossil record.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-no-snakes-in-ireland>Are there no snakes in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Ireland is one of many countries where there are no snakes Ireland is not the only place in the world without snakes – there are no native species of snakes to be found in Iceland, Greenland, Hawaii, New Zealand, parts of Canada, northern Russia, or, not surprisingly, Antarctica . . .</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-name-of-the-irish-serpent-come-from>Where did the name of the Irish serpent come from?</h2>
<p>The name is a variation of Naddred, meaning “wise serpent,” and is probably also akin to Naga which can be rendered Nasha, hence “nation.” The word naga denotes the serpent-kings of India. Nuada’s Babylonian counterpart is Nata, who, like the Irish Nada, was a survivor of the great prehistoric flood.)</p>
<h2 id=why-do-so-many-people-fail-the-driving-test-in-ireland>Why do so many people fail the driving test in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Inexperienced or new drivers commonly get marked down for vehicle control, and this is one of the reasons so many people fail the driving test in Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-st-patrick-drive-snakes-out-of-ireland>When did St Patrick Drive snakes out of Ireland?</h2>
<p>Did St. Patrick Really Drive Snakes Out of Ireland? It’s the stuff of legend: The reptiles never existed on the Emerald Isle. St. Patrick’s Day, which is celebrated worldwide on March 17, honors St. Patrick, the Christian missionary who supposedly rid Ireland of snakes during the fifth century A.D.</p>
