<h2 id=what-is-being-done-to-help-water-scarcity-in-egypt>What is being done to help water scarcity in Egypt?</h2>
<p>It is imperative on the Egyptian government and the entire population of to act swiftly and decisively to mitigate water scarcity, implement water conservation techniques and control water pollution develop plans that would install more efficient irrigation techniques.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-help-water-scarcity>How can we help water scarcity?</h2>
<p>What is your top solution for the water crisis?</p>
<ol>
<li>Education/Awareness.</li>
<li>New Conservation Technologies.</li>
<li>Recycle Wastewater.</li>
<li>Improve Irrigation and Agriculture Water Use.</li>
<li>Water Pricing.</li>
<li>Energy Efficient Desal Plants.</li>
<li>Rain Water Harvesting.</li>
<li>Community Governance and Partnerships.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=is-water-shortage-a-problem>Is water shortage a problem?</h2>
<p>As a result, some 1.1 billion people worldwide lack access to water, and a total of 2.7 billion find water scarce for at least one month of the year. Inadequate sanitation is also a problem for 2.4 billion people—they are exposed to diseases, such as cholera and typhoid fever, and other water-borne illnesses.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-factors-are-responsible-for-scarcity>What two factors are responsible for scarcity?</h2>
<p>Limited natural resources and concentration of resources in a few hands are two main factors that define scarcity.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-problems-of-water-scarcity>What are the problems of water scarcity?</h2>
<p>Disastrous Effects of Water Scarcity</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of Access to Drinking Water. The biggest problem that happens when you have water scarcity is that people are not able to get fresh, clean drinking water.</li>
<li>Hunger.</li>
<li>Lack of Education.</li>
<li>Diseases.</li>
<li>Sanitation Issues.</li>
<li>Poverty.</li>
<li>Migration.</li>
<li>Destruction of Habitats.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-to-do-about-the-water-crisis-in-egypt>What to do about the water crisis in Egypt?</h2>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-deprived-of-access-to-sanitation-in-egypt>How many people are deprived of access to sanitation in Egypt?</h2>
<p>In urban slum areas, only around 77 percent of households have piped water coming into their homes and in many cases the connection is illegal. In Egypt, 8.4 million people are deprived of access to improved sanitation, mostly in rural areas.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-of-the-population-in-egypt-has-access-to-water>How much of the population in Egypt has access to water?</h2>
<p>In 2014, around 91 percent of the Egyptian population received water directly into their residence. [1] However, while access to water is almost universal and reliable in urban areas, a significant number of households are still not connected with the water system in rural areas and in urban slums.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-egypt-worried-about-the-nile-river>Why is Egypt worried about the Nile River?</h2>
<p>This creates major concern for Egypt, who is worried that this damn would decrease the amount of water it receives (55.5 billion cubic meters) from the Nile River. Egypt is concerned that during dry months, not enough water will be released from the GERD thus decreasing the water received downstream.</p>
