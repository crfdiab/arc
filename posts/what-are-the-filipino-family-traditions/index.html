<h2 id=what-are-the-filipino-family-traditions>What are the Filipino family traditions?</h2>
<p>Filipinos are known for having strong and close family ties. They place high regard and put importance on their family before anything else. They work all day and do all they can to feed and provide for their family. In other countries, when a person turned 18, he/she can live away from his/her family.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-filipinos-express-grief>How do Filipinos express grief?</h2>
<p>People send flowers either for the dead or to the family and friends of the departed to give their sympathy and grief. One will notice that despite the smallness of a room, flowers can be seen all over the place because that’s how Filipinos express their full sympathy to the life of their family member or friend.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-customs-and-traditions-of-the-philippines>What are the customs and traditions of the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Our culture is a big reflection of our great and complex history. It is influenced by most of the people we have interacted with. A blend of the Malayo-Polynesian and Hispanic culture with the influence from Chinese, Indians Arabs, and other Asian cultures really contribute to the customs and traditions of the Filipinos.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-oldest-tradition-in-the-philippines>Which is the oldest tradition in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Practiced as a sign of respect to elders, pagmamano is one of the oldest and most notable Filipino tradition there is. Mano means hand in Spanish, fittingly so as pagmamano is done by gently tapping the hand of the elder to a younger person’s forehead. The elder in return says “God bless you” hence why the act is also often referred to as “bless”.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-traditions-of-a-filipino-wedding>What are the traditions of a Filipino wedding?</h2>
<p>Filipino weddings are not just for the bride and groom, but also for the whole family and community. Whether you’re going to have a traditional Filipino wedding, or you’re simply attending one, here are some traditions and practices you should definitely know about.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-do-filipinos-eat-with-their-hands>What kind of food do Filipinos eat with their hands?</h2>
<p>In addition to the use of the fork and spoon, eating with your hands or kamayan is another common Filipino tradition. For many Filipinos, kamayan gives full taste to the food instead of using utensils. Gather a small portion of meat or fish and a bite-sized portion of rice on your plate.</p>
