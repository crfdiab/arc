<h2 id=what-were-the-four-large-groups-of-saint-domingue>What were the four large groups of Saint-Domingue?</h2>
<p>When the French Revolution broke out in 1789, there were four distinct sets of interest groups in Saint-Domingue, with distinct sets of interests and even some important distinctions within these many categories: The whites. The free people of color. The black slaves.</p>
<h2 id=what-social-class-began-the-rebellion-in-haiti>What social class began the rebellion in Haiti?</h2>
<p>The Haitian Revolution was the result of a long struggle on the part of the slaves in the French colony of St. Domingue, but was also propelled by the free Mulattoes who had long faced the trials of being denoted as semi-citizens.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-ruler-of-saint-domingue-during-the-french-revolution>Who was the ruler of Saint Domingue during the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>Léger-Félicité Sonthonax from September 1792 to 1795 was the de facto ruler of Saint-Domingue. He was a French Girondist and abolitionist during the French Revolution who controlled 7,000 French troops in Saint-Domingue during part of the Haitian Revolution. His official title was Civil Commissioner.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-government-like-in-haiti-after-the-revolution>What was the government like in Haiti after the Revolution?</h2>
<p>Haiti after the Revolution. An independent government was created in Haiti, but the country’s society remained deeply affected by patterns established under French colonial rule. As in other French colonial societies, a class of free people of color had developed after centuries of French rule here.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-haitian-revolution-a-stepchild-of-the-french-revolution>Why was the Haitian Revolution a stepchild of the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>Historian Franklin Knight calls the Haitian Revolution the “inadvertent stepchild of the French Revolution.” In 1789, the French colony of Saint-Domingue was the most successful plantation colony in the Americas: it supplied France with 66% of its tropical produce and accounted for 33% of French foreign trade.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-slave-rebellion-in-saint-domingue-start>When did the slave rebellion in Saint Domingue start?</h2>
<p>In 1791, enslaved Africans and some free people of color of Saint-Domingue began waging a rebellion against French authority.</p>
