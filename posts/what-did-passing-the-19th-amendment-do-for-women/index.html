<h2 id=what-did-passing-the-19th-amendment-do-for-women>What did passing the 19th amendment do for women?</h2>
<p>On August 18th, 1920, the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified. It granted all American women the right to vote. The article read, “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.”</p>
<h2 id=what-right-was-given-in-the-19th-amendment>What right was given in the 19th Amendment?</h2>
<p>Women’s Right to Vote<br>
Women’s Right to Vote. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-womens-rights-movement-affect-society>How did women’s rights movement affect society?</h2>
<p>Voting ensures women’s reproductive and economic progress. The 19th Amendment helped millions of women move closer to equality in all aspects of American life. Women advocated for job opportunities, fairer wages, education, sex education, and birth control.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-19th-amendment-do-for-women>What did the 19th Amendment do for women?</h2>
<p>The 19th Amendment did not grant the right to vote for millions of Black, Native American, and Asian American women. To celebrate the centennial as a liberation for all women would be a disservice to the women of color who were often shunned and discounted by the leaders of the women’s suffrage movement.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-reaction-to-the-19th-amendment>What was the reaction to the 19th Amendment?</h2>
<p>Indeed, just two months after the 19th amendment was ratified, the prominent African American suffragist and activist Mary Church Terrell wrote a letter to NAACP president Moorfield Storey that was filled with foreboding: The colored women of the South will be shamefully treated, and will not be alowed [sic] to vote, I am sure.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-carrie-chapman-catt-say-about-the-19th-amendment>What did Carrie Chapman Catt say about the 19th Amendment?</h2>
<p>In 1918, leading suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt framed the argument this way in a letter to North Carolina Congressman Edwin Webb, trying to persuade him to vote yes on the 19th amendment: [The] present condition in the South makes sovereigns of some negro men, while all white women are their subjects.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-federal-suffrage-amendment-affect-women>How did the federal suffrage amendment affect women?</h2>
<p>The federal suffrage amendment prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex, but it did not address other kinds of discrimination that many American women faced: women from marginalized communities were excluded on the basis of gender and race.</p>
