<h2 id=why-did-so-many-jamaicans-move-to-england>Why did so many Jamaicans move to England?</h2>
<p>A lot of these later arrivals came from Jamaica’s capital and largest city, Kingston where the divide between rich and poor is much more evident than other places on the island. Most first generation immigrants moved to Britain in order to seek and improved standard of living, escape violence or to find employment.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-caribbeans-come-to-england>Why did the Caribbeans come to England?</h2>
<p>As a result of the losses during the war, the British government began to encourage mass immigration from the former countries of the British Empire and Commonwealth to fill shortages in the labour market.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-afro-caribbeans-bring-to-britain>What did the Afro Caribbeans bring to Britain?</h2>
<p>On 22 June the UK marks Windrush Day, celebrating the arrival of the Empire Windrush in Britain. In 1948, hundreds of people from the Caribbean boarded the ship and travelled to Tilbury Docks in Essex. With them they brought an explosion of dance, art, writing and music which would transform British culture.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-afro-caribbeans-come-to-the-uk>When did Afro Caribbeans come to the UK?</h2>
<p>Up the mid-1950’s, due to shortages in the UK labour force, Afro-Caribbean migration to Britain increased. It is estimated the about a quarter of a million Afro Caribbean people arrived to settle permanently in Britain between 1955 and 1962.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-caribbean-immigrants-come-to-the-uk>Why did Caribbean immigrants come to the UK?</h2>
<p>During the post world war two era the presence of Caribbean immigrants was requested to help reconstruct the British economy. Industries such as British Rail, the NHS and London transport recruited almost exclusively from Jamaica and Barbados. Up the mid-1950’s, due to shortages in the UK labour force, Afro-Caribbean migration to Britain increased.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-black-caribbean-people-live-in-england>How many black Caribbean people live in England?</h2>
<p>18.1% of Black Caribbean people lived in the most deprived 10% of neighbourhoods in England compared with 8.6% of White British people. (England, 2012/13) The Black Caribbean ethnic group had a younger age profile than the White British group at the time of the 2011 Census of England and Wales.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-come-to-britain-from-africa>Why did people come to Britain from Africa?</h2>
<p>For traders of 17th- and 18th-century Britain, the African was literally a unit of currency. Those who came to Britain were often brought in by planters, government officials, and military and naval officers returning to the United Kingdom.</p>
