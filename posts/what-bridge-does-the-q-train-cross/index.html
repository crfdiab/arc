<h2 id=what-bridge-does-the-q-train-cross>What bridge does the Q train cross?</h2>
<p>The Manhattan bridge<br>
The Manhattan bridge can be crossed by foot car or train. You can walk over the top. The B, D, N and Q Trains cross over the bottom sides of the bridge.</p>
<h2 id=do-trains-go-over-williamsburg-bridge>Do trains go over Williamsburg Bridge?</h2>
<p>Rail tracks The Williamsburg and Manhattan bridges are the only suspension bridges in New York City that still carry both automobile and rail traffic.</p>
<h2 id=do-trains-go-over-brooklyn-bridge>Do trains go over Brooklyn Bridge?</h2>
<p>No. Subway trains travel on the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges but not the Brooklyn Bridge. Also, some trains cross between Manhattan and Brooklyn through tunnels under the East River. Train service over the Brooklyn bridge ended in 1944.</p>
<h2 id=which-train-goes-over-the-williamsburg-bridge>Which train goes over the Williamsburg Bridge?</h2>
<p>Connecting the Lower East Side of Manhattan with Brooklyn, the Williamsburg Bridge stretches over the East River and carries the J, M and Z subway lines, a bike path and a walkway, in addition to its eight lanes of vehicle capacity. Opened in 1903, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time.</p>
<h2 id=do-nyc-trains-go-underwater>Do NYC trains go underwater?</h2>
<p>Originally Answered: Does NYC subway go underwater? Yes. There’s a four track tube under the Harlem River between Manhattan and the Bronx and two more pairs of tunnels under the lower East River.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-bridge-in-new-york-city>What is the name of the bridge in New York City?</h2>
<p>The Queensboro Bridge. The Queensboro is also known as the 59th Street Bridge and, since March 2011, the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge. This double-decked cantilever beauty spans the East River, connecting Long Island City with Midtown East by way of Roosevelt Island.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-train-from-staten-island-to-new-york-city>Is there a train from Staten Island to New York City?</h2>
<p>The Staten Island Railway is a separate train system that runs on Staten Island only. Even though it is often depicted on the New York subway map, there does not exist a physical connection between the two systems. You have to take the (free) Staten Island Ferry or cross the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on a car to get to Staten Island.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-new-york-central-railroad-run>Where does the New York Central Railroad run?</h2>
<p>Train passing underneath Manhattan’s Bell Laboratories Building in 1936. One exception was a New York Central Railroad line on the east bank of the Hudson that extended into Manhattan for freight service. This West Side Line, brought freight cars to docks, warehouses and industries along Manhattan’s west shore.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-subway-lines-in-new-york-city>Where are the subway lines in New York City?</h2>
<p>Manhattan is not that wide and Staten Island isn’t really that small. The map is intentionally distorted to highlight the subway lines, stations, and the connections between them. Stations might actually be farther apart or closer together than they appear on this map. The thick, solid colored lines are obviously the subway lines.</p>
