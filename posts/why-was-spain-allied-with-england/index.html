<h2 id=why-was-spain-allied-with-england>Why was Spain allied with England?</h2>
<p>Spain, a rapidly fading military power, was unable to depend upon its longtime ally France, which was torn by internal revolution. The dispute was settled by negotiations in 1792–94, which became friendly when Spain switched sides in 1792 and became an ally of Britain against France.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-brits-go-to-spain>Why do Brits go to Spain?</h2>
<p>It is clear the the British people love Spain for its weather, accessibility, affordability but more so the culture that it offers people and the chance to relax amongst some of the most spectacular scenery in Europe.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-spain-take-over-england-in-1588>Why did Spain take over England in 1588?</h2>
<p>The aim was to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I and her establishment of Protestantism in England, to stop English interference in the Spanish Netherlands, and to stop the harm caused by English and Dutch privateering ships that disrupted Spanish interests in the Americas.</p>
<h2 id=did-spain-help-the-british>Did Spain Help the British?</h2>
<p>Spain declared war on Britain as an ally of France, itself an ally of the American colonies. Most notably, Spanish forces attacked British positions in the south and captured West Florida from Britain in the siege of Pensacola. Spain also provided money, supplies, and munitions to the American forces.</p>
<h2 id=what-will-happen-to-brits-in-spain-after-brexit>What will happen to Brits in Spain after Brexit?</h2>
<p>It has recently been announced that UK citizens registering as residents in Spain will now be issued with a TIE residence card. Britons who were living in Spain before the end of the transition period will have an easier route to residency than those residents of other third party countries, for example.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-spanish-want-to-invade-england>Why did the Spanish want to invade England?</h2>
<p>Spain was the richest and the most powerful Empire in Europe, and Phillip decided to invade England. He believed that it would help him secure many of Europe’s strategic objectives if he were successful. The Spanish presented the Armada as a Catholic crusade, and the Papacy partially funded it.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-elizabeth-i-help-the-dutch-against-spain>Why did Elizabeth I help the Dutch against Spain?</h2>
<p>Protestants in the Netherlands began a revolt against Spanish rule in 1572. Elizabeth secretly supported the Dutch rebels because she knew the Dutch revolt would keep the Spanish too busy to threaten England. In 1585, Elizabeth sent an army to help the Dutch rebels fight Spain. For the first time English and Spanish armies were fighting each other.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-spanish-armada-important-to-england>Why was the Spanish Armada important to England?</h2>
<p>It had grown extremely wealthy due to its conquests in the New World (Central America), an area that was known as the Spanish Main. It was also strongly Catholic, and although England and Wales enjoyed good relations with Spain at the start of Elizabeth’s reign, there were many reasons why they worsened, eventually resulting in war.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-european-powers-help-spain-during-the-civil-war>Why did the European powers help Spain during the Civil War?</h2>
<p>The aid came even after all the European powers had signed a Non-Intervention Agreement in 1936. Although individual sympathy for the plight of the Spanish Republic was widespread in the liberal democracies, pacifism and the fear of a second world war prevented them from selling or giving arms.</p>
