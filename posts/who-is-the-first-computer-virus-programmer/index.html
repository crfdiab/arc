<h2 id=who-is-the-first-computer-virus-programmer>Who is the first computer virus programmer?</h2>
<p>The Brain Boot Sector Virus Brain, the first PC virus, began infecting 5.2″ floppy disks in 1986. As Securelist reports, it was the work of two brothers, Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi, who ran a computer store in Pakistan.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-first-filipino-made-computer-virus>What is the first Filipino made computer virus?</h2>
<p>The malware was created by Onel de Guzman, a then-24-year-old resident of Manila, Philippines….ILOVEYOU.</p>
<table><tr><th>Common name</th><th>ILOVEYOU</th></tr><tr><td>Aliases</td><td>Love Bug, Love Letter</td></tr><tr><td>Type</td><td>Computer worm</td></tr><tr><td>Point of origin</td><td>Manila, Philippines</td></tr><tr><td>Author(s)</td><td>Onel de Guzman</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=who-invented-love-bug-virus>Who invented Love Bug virus?</h2>
<p>Onel de Guzman<br>
For two decades, Onel de Guzman has been suspected of unleashing the groundbreaking virus. But he’s never confessed to anything—until now. This story is adapted from Crime Dot Com: From Viruses to Vote Rigging, How Hacking Went Global, by Geoff White.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-worst-computer-virus>What’s the worst computer virus?</h2>
<p>Part macro virus and part worm. Melissa, a MS Word-based macro that replicates itself through e-mail. Mydoom was the world’s fastest spreading computer worm to date, surpassing Sobig, and the ILOVEYOU computer worms, yet it was used to DDoS servers.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-strongest-virus-in-computer>What is the strongest virus in computer?</h2>
<p>The biggest computer virus ever is the Mydoom virus, which did an estimated $38 billion in damages in 2004. Other notables are the Sobig worm at $30 billion and the Klez worm at $19.8 billion.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-legendary-hacker>Who is the legendary hacker?</h2>
<p>Once one of the FBI’s Most Wanted because he went on an ‘electronic joyride’ during which he hacked into more than 40 major corporations just for the challenge and not for monetary gain, Kevin Mitnick was once the most elusive computer break-in artist in history.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-virus-is-iloveyou-virus>What kind of virus is ILOVEYOU virus?</h2>
<p>Although ILOVEYOU, also known as the Love Bug at the time, is commonly referred to as a computer virus, more specifically it’s a worm.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-creator-of-the-first-computer-virus>Who was the creator of the first computer virus?</h2>
<p>The creator of the world’s first global computer virus has admitted to his guilt – 20 years after his software infected tens of millions of machines worldwide. Filipino Onel de Guzman, now 44, says he unleashed the “Love Bug” computer worm to steal passwords so he could access the internet without paying.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-responsible-for-the-iloveyou-computer-virus>Who was responsible for the ILOVEYOU computer virus?</h2>
<p>20 years ago, a young Filipino programmer, Onel de Guzman, was about to become the prime suspect in a criminal investigation. Why? He appeared to have set lose the so called ILOVEYOU computer virus, a worm that infected tens of millions of Windows computers around the world in May 2000.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-iloveyou-virus-illegal-in-the-philippines>Is the ILOVEYOU virus illegal in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>In the margins of Onel de Guzman’s proposal, his professor wrote: “This is illegal !” and “We don’t produce burglars!” The argument about the illegality later proved to be incorrect. At the time, the Philippines had no laws covering computer hacking.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-creator-of-the-love-bug-virus>Who was the creator of the Love Bug virus?</h2>
<p>De Guzman insisted Buen had nothing to do with the Love Bug and that he was its sole creator. After a period of lying low, de Guzman returned to computer work, but did not go back to college. He now runs the small phone repair booth with another member of staff. He says he regrets writing the virus, and the infamy it has brought.</p>
