<h2 id=what-was-southern-colonies-religion>What was Southern colonies religion?</h2>

<h2 id=did-the-southern-colony-have-religious-freedom>Did the southern colony have religious freedom?</h2>

<h2 id=who-founded-the-southern-colonies-and-why>Who founded the southern colonies and why?</h2>
<p>The Southern Colonies in North America were established by the British during the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-common-religion-in-the-south>What is the most common religion in the South?</h2>
<p>Religion in South America has been a major influence on art, culture, philosophy and law. Christianity is the main religion, with Roman Catholics having the most adherents. Sizeable minorities of non-religious people and adherents of other religions are also present.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-christianity-come-to-america>How did Christianity come to America?</h2>
<p>Christianity was introduced to North America as it was colonized by Europeans beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries. Today most Christians in the United States are Mainline Protestant, Evangelical, or Roman Catholic.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-of-the-original-13-colonies>What was the religion of the original 13 colonies?</h2>
<p>The New England colonists were largely Puritans, who led very strict lives. The Middle colonists were a mixture of religions, including Quakers (led by William Penn), Catholics, Lutherans, Jews, and others. The Southern colonists had a mixture of religions as well, including Baptists and Anglicans.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-of-the-southern-colonies>What was the religion of the southern colonies?</h2>
<p>The southern colonies had many different religions, but were primarily Anglicans or Baptists. The middle colonies also had many different religions, which included Catholics, Jews and Quakers.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-official-religion-of-the-carolinas>What was the official religion of the Carolinas?</h2>
<p>Anglican was the official religion of both colonies, but the area was too sparsely settled to organize the church. In an attempt to increase the population, the Carolinas’ English proprietors promised religious freedom to anyone who agreed to settle there.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-anglican-church-important-to-the-southern-colonies>Why was the Anglican Church important to the southern colonies?</h2>
<p>Maryland was chartered as a religious refuge for Roman Catholics. The Anglican Church initially was the official church of Virginia and the Carolinas. However, the need for additional settlers to populate the colonies and protect them from intruders soon outweighed the desire for religious exclusivism.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-religious-pluralism-important-in-the-southern-colonies>Why was religious pluralism important in the southern colonies?</h2>
<p>Because populating Georgia was a necessity, religious pluralism was encouraged in the colony from its founding in 1732. Its Royal Charter did not recognize the Church of England as the colony’s official church and granted religious liberty to all except Roman Catholics.</p>
