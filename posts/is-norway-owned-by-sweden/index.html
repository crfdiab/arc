<h2 id=is-norway-owned-by-sweden>Is Norway owned by Sweden?</h2>
<p>In 1814, after being on the losing side of the Napoleonic Wars with Denmark, Norway was ceded to the king of Sweden by the Treaty of Kiel. Norway declared its independence and adopted a constitution. The union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905.</p>
<h2 id=are-norway-and-sweden-close-to-each-other>Are Norway and Sweden close to each other?</h2>
<p>Norway is located on the western part of the Scandinavian Peninsula in North West Europe. Sweden is located on the east side of the Scandinavian Peninsula in North Europe. It is bound by Finland, the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea to the east, Kattegat to the southwest and Norway to the west and northwest….</p>
<h2 id=how-do-norwegians-feel-about-swedes>How do Norwegians feel about Swedes?</h2>
<p>Overall, Norwegians tend to use Swedes as the butt of many, many jokes. They are also sometimes mocked for being (relatively) poorer than Norwegians. It’s a mixed feeling, but not a hard one.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-norway-not-join-the-eu>Why did Norway not join the EU?</h2>
<p>Norway has high GNP per capita, and would have to pay a high membership fee. The country has a limited amount of agriculture, and few underdeveloped areas, which means that Norway would receive little economic support from the EU.</p>
<h2 id=is-norway-ruled-by-a-king>Is Norway ruled by a king?</h2>
<p>Harald V of NorwaySince 1991<br>
Norway/King</p>
<h2 id=when-did-sweden-establish-diplomatic-relations-with-norway>When did Sweden establish diplomatic relations with Norway?</h2>
<p>The countries established diplomatic relations in 1905, after the dissolution of the union between them in 1905. Sweden has an embassy in Oslo and 14 consulates, in Ålesund, Arendal, Bergen, Bodø, Hamar, Hammerfest, Kirkenes, Mandal, Moss, Narvik, Porsgrunn, Stavanger, Tromsø and Trondheim.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-border-between-sweden-and-norway>Is there a border between Sweden and Norway?</h2>
<p>Crossing the border between Sweden and Norway is relatively simple. No passport is required due to the Nordic Passport Union and there are no physical border obstructions. However, since Norway is not part of the European Union customs controls can be made if travelling by car to prohibit smuggling.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-live-in-sweden-and-norway>How many people live in Sweden and Norway?</h2>
<p>There are around 44,773 Swedes living in Norway and around 18,000 Norwegians living in Sweden. Crossing the border between Sweden and Norway is relatively simple. No passport is required due to the Nordic Passport Union and there are no physical border obstructions.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-rivals-of-norway-and-sweden>Who are the rivals of Norway and Sweden?</h2>
<p>But the rivalry between brothers had to end, the true rival of Sweden was Russia, the true rival of Denmark was Germany, and the true rival of Norway was England. Pushed from all sides, the only alternative since the Napoleonic Wars has been to cooperate.</p>
