<h2 id=what-do-archaeologists-know-about-stonehenge>What do archaeologists know about Stonehenge?</h2>

<h2 id=what-do-historians-know-about-the-stonehenge>What do historians know about the Stonehenge?</h2>
<p>Stonehenge is perhaps the world’s most famous prehistoric monument. It was built in several stages: the first monument was an early henge monument, built about 5,000 years ago, and the unique stone circle was erected in the late Neolithic period about 2500 BC.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-stonehenge-answer>What is the Stonehenge answer?</h2>
<p>“Stonehenge is the most architecturally sophisticated and only surviving lintelled prehistoric stone circle in the world. It is a unique prehistoric monument that forms part of an extraordinary ancient landscape so rich and varied that it was designated a World Heritage Site in 1986.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-stonehenge-built>Why was Stonehenge built?</h2>
<p>Stonehenge was built as a burial site Analysis of the bones suggests they were buried during this 500-year period. Carbon dating of the remains suggests they were cremated off-site, transported to Stonehenge and buried there around 4,400-5,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-stones-are-in-stonehenge>How many stones are in Stonehenge?</h2>
<p>There are 93 rocks or lumps of stone visible at Stonehenge now – not counting the buried and missing ones. All the stones are numbered on standard plans, see below. Note, if a numbered stone is broken and two separate bits or fragments of it are visible then it counts as two stones etc.</p>
<h2 id=does-stonehenge-have-healing-powers>Does Stonehenge have healing powers?</h2>
<p>LONDON — The first excavation of Stonehenge in more than 40 years has uncovered evidence that the stone circle drew ailing pilgrims from around Europe for what they believed to be its healing properties, archeologists said Monday.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-stonehenge-important>Why is the Stonehenge important?</h2>
<p>A World Heritage Site Stonehenge is the most architecturally sophisticated prehistoric stone circle in the world, while Avebury is the largest in the world. Together with inter-related monuments and their associated landscapes, they help us to understand Neolithic and Bronze Age ceremonial and mortuary practices.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-we-know-about-the-stonehenge-mystery>What do we know about the Stonehenge mystery?</h2>
<p>Although archaeologists have greatly expanded our knowledge of Stonehenge–through such means as radiocarbon dating, examination of bone fragments and attempts at re-creating stone hauling—many Stonehenge mysteries still remain.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-the-skeleton-found-at-stonehenge>How old was the skeleton found at Stonehenge?</h2>
<p>In the ditch surrounding Stonehenge, archaeologists uncovered the skeleton of an adult male dating from around 2000 BC. He was tall, approximately twenty-seven years old and shot with arrows in his back and sternum. The skeleton was moved to an exhibit at the Salisbury Museum south of Stonehenge. Was this killing evidence of a ritual execution?</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-stonehenge-druids-and-what-do-they-do>Who are the Stonehenge Druids and what do they do?</h2>
<p>In answer to this question we though it better to go to the people themselves and asked Aes Dana Grove or, as they are better known, the ‘Amesbury Stonehenge Druids’ if they could shed some light on their practices and tell us about their faith and traditions.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-carvings-older-than-stonehenge>Where can I find carvings older than Stonehenge?</h2>
<p>Elaborate carvings on the stones of spirals, lozenges and other geometric shapes are found at other Neolithic sites, many much older than Stonehenge. The spirals of Ireland’s Newgrange may be the best known, but Loughcrew in Ireland also boasts mysterious carvings.</p>
