<p>Your cookouts probably don’t look like this one. Back in the 1940s, young people donned their retro swimsuits and cooked beachside in Los Angeles. As the United States was in throes of World War II, there was trouble in Los Angeles too.</p>

<p>From the founding of the Griffith Observatory to the history-making O.J. Simpson chase to the recent California wildfires, we’re looking at (almost) everything that’s transpired in L.A. since the early 1900s. So hop in our time machine and cruise down the freeways of past, present, and future.</p>

<p>In October 1945, film workers conducted a strike against Warner Bros. Studio, picketing and fighting with the Burbank police. This was just one of many labor strikes in the entertainment industry.
