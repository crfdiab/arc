<p>1528<br>
Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca Núñez was treasurer to the Spanish expedition under Pánfilo de Narváez that reached what is now Tampa Bay, Florida, in 1528. By September all but his party of 60 had perished; it reached the shore near present-day Galveston, Texas.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-cabeza-de-vaca-explore-texas>When did Cabeza de Vaca explore Texas?</h2>
<p>Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca first set foot on land that would become Texas in 1528, when his crude raft ran aground near Galveston Island. The raft held survivors of an ill-fated Spanish expedition to settle Florida.</p>
<h2 id=when-cabeza-de-vaca-landed-on-the-texas-coast-which-tribe-would-he-have-encountered>When Cabeza de Vaca landed on the Texas coast which tribe would he have encountered?</h2>
<p>Their journey went well until the two men confronted Matagorda Bay. There they encountered an Indian tribe, which Cabeza de Vaca called the Quevenes, who threatened to kill them by placing arrows over their hearts.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-cabeza-de-vaca-land-in-texas>How did Cabeza de Vaca land in Texas?</h2>
<p>Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca lands in Texas The Spanish conquistador Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca is shipwrecked on a low sandy island off the coast of Texas. Starving, dehydrated, and desperate, he is the first European to set foot on the soil of the future Lone Star state.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-cabeza-de-vaca-crash-on-galveston-island>Where did Cabeza de Vaca crash on Galveston Island?</h2>
<p>With his exploration party reduced to only 80 or 90 men, Cabeza de Vaca’s motley flotilla finally wrecked on what was probably Galveston Island just off the coast of Texas.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-alvar-nunez-cabeza-de-vaca-travel>Where did Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca travel?</h2>
<p>Traveling mostly with this small group, Cabeza de Vaca explored what is now the U.S. state of Texas, as well as the northeastern Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila, and possibly smaller portions of New Mexico and Arizona. He traveled on foot through the then-colonized territories of Texas and the coast.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-relation-of-cabeza-de-vaca-published>When was the relation of Cabeza de Vaca published?</h2>
<p>These narratives were collected and published in 1542 in Spain. They are now known as The Relation of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca. The narrative of Cabeza de Vaca is the “first European book devoted completely to North America.” His detailed account describes the lives of numerous tribes of American Indians of the time.</p>
