<h2 id=what-are-some-examples-of-cultural-conflicts>What are some examples of cultural conflicts?</h2>
<p>An example of cultural conflict is the debate over abortion. Ethnic cleansing is another extreme example of cultural conflict. Wars can also be a result of a cultural conflict; for example the differing views on slavery were one of the reasons for the American civil war.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-major-cause-of-cultural-conflict-today>What is a major cause of cultural conflict today?</h2>
<p>Including axio-normative conditions, cultural conflicts are often provoked by the socioeconomic situation in given communities. Furthermore, stereotypes, prejudice, and culture shock are important factors which may lead to conflict (Hottola 2004).</p>
<h2 id=how-does-culture-lead-to-conflict>How does culture lead to conflict?</h2>
<p>Cultures are embedded in every conflict because conflicts arise in human relationships. Cultures affect the ways we name, frame, blame, and attempt to tame conflicts. Culture is always a factor in conflict, whether it plays a central role or influences it subtly and gently.</p>
<h2 id=is-canada-in-any-wars-right-now>Is Canada in any wars right now?</h2>
<p>Since the Second World War, however, Canada has been committed to multilateralism and has gone to war only within large multinational coalitions such as in the Korean War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, and the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-conflict-in-canada>What is a conflict in Canada?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-cultural-conflict>What is meant by cultural conflict?</h2>
<p>: the conflict of behavior patterns and values that results when different cultures are incompletely assimilated especially : the conflict that may find expression in high rates of criminality and delinquency.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-overcome-cultural-conflict>How do you overcome cultural conflict?</h2>
<p>The best way to resolve or handle cultural conflict is by learning about other cultures. Organizations work in diverse environments. This gives people the opportunity to interact regardless of culture (Wang, 2018).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-stages-of-conflict>What are the stages of conflict?</h2>

<h2 id=post-conflict-peacebuilding-and-reconciliation-how-do-you-deal-with-cultural-conflict>Post-Conflict Peacebuilding and Reconciliation. How do you deal with cultural conflict?</h2>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-cultural-conflicts-in-canada>Why are there so many cultural conflicts in Canada?</h2>
<p>Individuals are unable to break free of their own cultural barriers, and adapt to Canadian cultural barriers that are frankly different and built upon social norms. What one would consider normal in his birthplace may be deemed a crime in Canadian society which is why the cultural conflicts continue to create more crime within Canada.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-crime-issues-in-canada>Why are there so many crime issues in Canada?</h2>
<p>Conflict culture, subcultures and differential association theory all underlie the reasons why there is a constant issue with crime in the multicultural metro poles. Individuals are unable to break free of their own cultural barriers, and adapt to Canadian cultural barriers that are frankly different and built upon social norms.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-canadian-society-a-reflection-of-multiculturalism>How is Canadian Society a reflection of multiculturalism?</h2>
<p>However, many Canadians consider the presence of many ethno-cultural groups in society as proof of multiculturalism. Some would count heads or utilize the variety of ethnic presence in a work setting as a measure of multiculturalism. The reality is that a society can be diverse in composition without becoming multicultural.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-culture-conflict-relate-to-multiculturalism>How does culture conflict relate to multiculturalism?</h2>
<p>This concept of culture relating to multiculturalism can relate to culture of conflict theory, the subculture theory and the differential association theory. It is not only within ethnic groups that cultural conflicts exist, but also within subcultural groups that are within a larger context of society.</p>
