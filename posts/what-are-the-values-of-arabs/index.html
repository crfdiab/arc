<h2 id=what-are-the-values-of-arabs>What are the values of Arabs?</h2>
<p>Some of the most important values for Arabs are honor and loyalty. Margaret Nydell, in her book Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times’ says that Arabs can be defined as, humanitarian, loyal and polite.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-middle-eastern-values>What are Middle Eastern values?</h2>
<p>A common thread that runs through many lives is the importance of family and the values that derive from having a strong extended family: respect, honor, and loyalty. The Middle East is the birthplace of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, all monotheistic religions that grew from the same tradition.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-four-major-ethnic-groups-in-the-middle-east>What are the four major ethnic groups in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Explanation: There are over a thousand ethnic groups in the Middle East, but the four major ones that the the area is known for are the Arabs, Azerbaijanis, Kurds, Persians. The Turks also make the fifth major ethnic group.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-values-of-the-arab-culture>What are the values of the Arab culture?</h2>
<p>Family is an integral aspect of Arab culture. Families maintain tribal and clan connections in many countries and loyalties are strong, hence the expression, “I and my brothers against my cousins; I and my cousins against the stranger.”. People know and speak proudly of their genealogy.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-beliefs-of-women-in-the-arab-world>What are the beliefs of women in the Arab world?</h2>
<p>According to the Quran, refraining from extramarital sex is the religious responsibility of all Muslims. In Arabic culture, women have the right to earn money by working outside the home. They also have the right to keep all of their earnings.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-such-a-thing-as-one-arab-culture>Is there such a thing as one Arab culture?</h2>
<p>It is intended for informal squad or small group instruction. The goal is to provide soldiers with a basic overview of Arab culture. It must be emphasized that there is no “one” Arab culture or society. The Arab world is full of rich and diverse communities, groups and cultures.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-characteristics-of-an-arab-person>What are the characteristics of an Arab person?</h2>
<p>People who are relaxed and personable enough to establish relationships tend to be more successful. Arabs are more likely to have subjective perceptions. To protect loss of face, an Arab will rarely admit to a mistake. Fatalism based on religious beliefs is common. Honor is more important than facts. Arabs believe in persons, not in institutions.</p>
