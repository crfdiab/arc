<h2 id=what-is-the-presiding-officer-senate-called>What is the presiding officer Senate called?</h2>
<p>The vice president of the United States serves as president of the Senate and therefore its presiding officer.</p>
<h2 id=who-has-the-job-of-standing-in-for-the-president-of-the-senate-in-their-absence>Who has the job of standing in for the president of the Senate in their absence?</h2>
<p>The president pro tempore designates other senators to preside in his absence, generally new members of the majority party. The Constitution provides for two officers to preside over the Senate. The vice president of the United States is designated as the president of the Senate.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-job-of-the-pro-tempore>What is the job of the pro tempore?</h2>
<p>The Constitution instructs the Senate to choose a president pro tempore to preside over the Senate in the absence of the vice president. Pro tempore is a Latin term meaning “for the time being,” signaling that the position was originally conceived as a temporary replacement.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-in-charge-of-the-senate-when-the-vice-president-is-not>Who is in charge of the Senate when the vice president is not?</h2>
<p>This means that if the vice president is unable to do his/her task, the Senate president will take over The Senate president will be placed in position by the other senators. In the US, the vice president is also the Senate president. This will make the president pro tempore the best person to take over the needed duties.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-presiding-officer-of-the-senate>Who was the presiding officer of the Senate?</h2>
<p>From John Adams in 1789 to Richard Nixon in the 1950s, presiding over the Senate was the chief function of vice presidents, who had an office in the Capitol, received their staff support and office expenses through the legislative appropriations, and rarely were invited to participate in cabinet meetings or other executive activities.</p>
<h2 id=when-to-address-the-vice-president-as-mrpresident>When to address the vice president as Mr.President?</h2>
<p>It was the custom for earlier presidents up to George H. W. Bush to refer to the vice president as “Mr. President” while addressing a joint session of Congress, in deference to their role as President of the Senate. Every president since Bill Clinton have since addressed the vice president acting as Senate President as “Mr./Madam Vice President”.</p>
