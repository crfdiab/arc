<h2 id=why-did-the-trail-to-oregon-follow-rivers>Why did the trail to Oregon Follow Rivers?</h2>
<p>It was used during the 19th century by Great Plains pioneers who were seeking fertile land in the West and North. As the trail developed it became marked by numerous cutoffs and shortcuts from Missouri to Oregon. The basic route follows river valleys as grass and water were absolutely necessary.</p>
<h2 id=what-river-did-the-oregon-trail-follow>What river did the Oregon Trail follow?</h2>
<p>Willamette River valley<br>
Oregon Trail, also called Oregon-California Trail, in U.S. history, an overland trail between Independence, Missouri, and Oregon City, near present-day Portland, Oregon, in the Willamette River valley.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-rivers-dangerous-on-the-oregon-trail>Why were rivers dangerous on the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>Crossing rivers was one of the most dangerous things that pioneers were required to do. Swollen rivers could tip over a wagon and drown both people and oxen and valuable supplies, goods, and equipment could be lost. Sometimes this was caused by animals panicking when wading through deep, swift water.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-effect-of-the-oregon-trail>What was the effect of the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>The Oregon Trail helped to change how the United States grew. It helped to move the population westward from the overpopulated East. If it was not for the Oregon Trail, many of the western states would not be or even look like they do today. The trail also helped spread culture and religious beliefs.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-route-of-the-oregon-trail>What was the route of the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>It was one of the two main emigrant routes to the American West in the 19th century, the other being the southerly Santa Fe Trail from Independence to Santa Fe (now in New Mexico ).</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-california-trail-diverge-from-the-oregon-trail>Where did the California trail diverge from the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>Near the junction of the Raft River and the Snake River, the California Trail diverged from the Oregon Trail at another Parting of the Ways junction. Travellers left the Snake River and followed Raft River about 65 miles (105 km) southwest past present day Almo, Idaho.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-jumping-off-point-for-the-oregon-trail>Where was the jumping off point for the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>Initially, the main “jumping off point” was the common head of the Santa Fe Trail and Oregon Trail—Independence, Missouri/Kansas City, Kansas. Travelers starting in Independence had to ferry across the Missouri River.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-oregon-trail-considered-too-demanding>Why was the Oregon Trail considered too demanding?</h2>
<p>Frontier explorers and fur trappers blazed the rough outlines of the Oregon Trail in the early 19th century, but the route was initially considered too demanding for women, children or covered wagons to navigate.</p>
