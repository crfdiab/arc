<p>Impact. The Pentagon Papers revealed that the United States had expanded its war with the bombing of Cambodia and Laos, coastal raids on North Vietnam, and Marine Corps attacks, none of which had been reported by the American media.</p>

<p>As the Vietnam War dragged on, military analyst Daniel Ellsberg—who had worked on the study—came to oppose the war, and decided that the information contained in the Pentagon Papers should be available to the American public. Nixon argued that publishing the Pentagon Papers was harmful to U.S. national security.</p>
