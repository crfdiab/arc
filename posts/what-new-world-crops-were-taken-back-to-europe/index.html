<p>Food historian Lois Ellen Frank calls potatoes, tomatoes, corn, beans, squash, chili, cacao, and vanilla the “magic eight” ingredients that were found and used only in the Americas before 1492 and were taken via the Columbian Exchange back to the Old World, dramatically transforming the cuisine there.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-new-world-bring-to-europe>What did the new world bring to Europe?</h2>
<p>Christopher Columbus introduced horses, sugar plants, and disease to the New World, while facilitating the introduction of New World commodities like sugar, tobacco, chocolate, and potatoes to the Old World. The process by which commodities, people, and diseases crossed the Atlantic is known as the Columbian Exchange.</p>

<p>The Columbian Exchange was more evenhanded when it came to crops. The Americas’ farmers’ gifts to other continents included staples such as corn (maize), potatoes, cassava, and sweet potatoes, together with secondary food crops such as tomatoes, peanuts, pumpkins, squashes, pineapples, and chili peppers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-plants-spread-from-europe-to-the-new-world>How did plants spread from Europe to the New World?</h2>
<p>In the late 1500s, European explorers discovered potatoes in South America and transported them to Spain, where the plants spread throughout Europe. Within about 50 years, Europeans transported the spuds back across the ocean to North America. Other plants moved from Europe to the New World.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-europeans-bring-from-the-old-world>What did the Europeans bring from the Old World?</h2>
<p>In addition to discovering New World plants, many plants were brought from the Old World to become hugely successful in the Americas. Among these plant, the most prevalent was sugarcane. The potato is an amazing example of a New World crop which became essential to European diet.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-europeans-exchange-plants-and-animals>How did the Europeans exchange plants and animals?</h2>
<p>The Exchange of Plant and Animal Species Between the New World and Old World. Overview. When Europeans reached North America’s shorelines in the late 1400s and began to explore the continent’s interior in the 1500s, they saw the vast land as a source of new plants, animals, and minerals for them to use and to transport back to Europe.</p>
