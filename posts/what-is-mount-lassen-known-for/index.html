<h2 id=what-is-mount-lassen-known-for>What is Mount Lassen known for?</h2>
<p>Lassen Peak is the largest plug dome volcano in the world and the southernmost volcano in the Cascade Range. Established in 1916, Lassen Volcanic National Park is home to meadows freckled with wildflowers, clear mountain lakes and numerous volcanoes.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-mount-lassen-get-its-name>How did Mount Lassen get its name?</h2>
<p>The park and Lassen Peak take their name from Peter Lassen, one of the first white settlers in the northern Sacramento Valley, who discovered of a route through the mountains called the Lassen Trail.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-are-rocks-at-mt-lassen>How old are rocks at Mt Lassen?</h2>
<p>3.5 million years<br>
The Lassen region, which comprises much of the Lake Almanor and Burney 1:100,000 topographic maps, is underlain by volcanic rocks ranging in age from 3.5 million years (Ma) to 100 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-times-has-mount-lassen-erupted>How many times has Mount Lassen erupted?</h2>
<p>The Lassen region of the southernmost Cascade Range is an active volcanic area. At least 70 eruptions have occurred in the past 100,000 years, including 3 in the past 1,000 years, most recently in 1915.</p>

<h2 id=is-mt-lassen-an-active-volcano>Is Mt Lassen an active volcano?</h2>
<p>However, Lassen Peak is considered active because it last erupted about 100 years ago (read more). Geologically recent volcanic activity in an area is the best guide to forecasting future eruptions.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-dacite-formed>How is dacite formed?</h2>
<p>Dacite ( /ˈdeɪˌsaɪt/) is a volcanic rock formed by rapid solidification of lava that is high in silica and low in alkali metal oxides. It has a fine-grained (aphanitic) to porphyritic texture and is intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-peak-of-mount-lassen>How tall is the peak of Mount Lassen?</h2>
<p>Lassen Peak is generally known as Mount Lassen. It is a volcanic peak in northern California, United States. It is the southernmost active volcano in the Cascade Range. It is a part of Lassen Volcanic National Park which is a group of more than 30 volcanic domes. The peak rises above the surrounding area to an elevation of 10,457 feet.</p>

<p>Lassen Peak is generally known as Mount Lassen. It is a volcanic peak in northern California, United States. It is the southernmost active volcano in the Cascade Range. It is a part of Lassen Volcanic National Park which is a group of more than 30 volcanic domes.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-mount-lassen-become-a-national-park>When did Mount Lassen become a National Park?</h2>
<p>Mount Lassen was intermittently active until 1921. The first real settlers to the Lassen area came with the California Gold Rush. This national park has four shield volcanoes including Raker Peak, Red Mountain, Mount Harkness and Prospect Peak. A round trip on the hiking trail takes between 3 to 5 hours depending on level of fitness.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-see-in-lassen-volcanic-national-park>What to see in Lassen volcanic National Park?</h2>
<p>The park’s largest and best-known hydrothermal area, Bumpass Hell is one of the top places to see in Lassen Volcanic National Park. A colorful area of bubbling mudpots and boiling pools, hissing steam vents and fumaroles, it’s an amazing sight.</p>
