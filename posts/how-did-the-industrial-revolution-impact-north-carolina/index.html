<p>North Carolina’s main industries turned the state’s agricultural products into finished goods. By the early twentieth century, the state’s economy was dominated by three industries. You can think of them as the three T’s: tobacco, textiles, and timber (or furniture).</p>

<p>Economy of North Carolina North Carolina’s economy was based mainly on the growing of tobacco in the 1700s and 1800s and on the manufacture of tobacco products and textiles in the early 1900s. While these activities remain important segments of the state’s economy, they have largely been overshadowed by other industries and services.</p>

<p>After a job loss or cut back in income, families may find it challenging to afford their children’s college education. Children may feel the impact of financial struggles at school when families are not able to provide adequate health care, summer activities or stability with residence.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-globalization-of-trade-affect-north-carolina>How does globalization of trade affect North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Globalization of trade has impacted North Carolina. The state has lost much of its textile and apparel industries. It is seeing a replacement of these with service and high technology industries. One immediate result of this shift is the replacement of better-paying blue collar jobs by low-wage service jobs.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-economic-impact-of-the-racial-wealth-gap>What is the economic impact of The racial wealth gap?</h2>
<p>It is estimated that its dampening effect on consumption and investment will cost the US economy between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion between 2019 and 2028—4 to 6 percent of the projected GDP in 2028 (Exhibit 2; see also sidebar “Quantifying the economic impact of closing the racial wealth gap”).</p>
