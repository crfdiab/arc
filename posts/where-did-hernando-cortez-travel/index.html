<h2 id=where-did-hernando-cortez-travel>Where did Hernando Cortez Travel?</h2>
<p>Mexico<br>
In 1519, Cortés was set to command his own expedition to Mexico when Velázquez cancelled it. Cortés ignored the order and traveled to Mexico anyway, setting his sights on overthrowing ruler Montezuma II in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-hernan-cortes-leave-behind>What did Hernan Cortes leave behind?</h2>
<p>Cortés led his army out of Tenochtitlan to meet them, leaving behind a garrison of 80 Spaniards and a few hundred Tlaxcaltecs to govern the city. In May 1521, Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan, and after a three-month siege the city fell. This victory marked the fall of the Aztec empire.</p>

<p>Hernan Cortes 1 Hernán Cortés and Diego Velázquez. Cortés was born in 1485 to Martín Cortés de Monroy and Doña Catalina Pizarro Altamarino, minor nobles in Medellín, Spain. 2 Cortés ‘Discovers’ Mexico.

<p>Upon his arrival in 1504 in Santo Domingo, the capital of Hispaniola, the 18-year-old Cortés registered as a citizen; this entitled him to a building plot and land to farm.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-hernan-cortes-appointed-captain-of-the-expedition>Why was Hernan Cortes appointed captain of the expedition?</h2>
<p>Cortés was appointed Captain-General of this new expedition in October 1518, but was advised to move fast before Velázquez changed his mind. With Cortés’ experience as an administrator, knowledge gained from many failed expeditions, and his impeccable rhetoric he was able to gather six ships and 300 men, within a month.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-cortes-go-after-he-defeated-the-spanish>Where did Cortes go after he defeated the Spanish?</h2>
<p>Cortés landed in Veracruz next, where his men elected him chief justice. According to some accounts, he sunk all but one of his ships before sending the intact one back to Spain. There would be no retreat for his men, only conquest.</p>
