<p>Benjamin H. Day<br>
ABOUT THE FOUNDER • The Penny Press is generally considered to have started in 1833, when Benjamin H. Day founded The Sun, a New York City newspaper. The Sun was the first popular penny paper.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-penny-newspapers-sell-for-one-cent-a-piece>Why did the penny newspapers sell for one cent a piece?</h2>
<p>The penny papers represented the crudest form of journalism because of the sensational gossip that was reported. The penny press was most noted for its price – only one cent per paper – while other contemporary newspapers were priced around six cents per issue.</p>
<h2 id=what-contributed-to-the-decline-of-newspaper-readership-in-the-1960s-and-1970s>What contributed to the decline of newspaper readership in the 1960s and 1970s?</h2>
<p>What contributed to the decline of newspaper readership in the 1960s and 1970s? They are doing better financially than many large papers because of less debt, less competition, and a loyal base of readers.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-penny-press-known-for>What is the penny press known for?</h2>
<p>THE Penny Press was most famous for its low price, a paper per penny. It was invented by Benjamin H. Day; the founder of New York’s The Sun. The Sun was the first popular penny paper and it became popular with the American public because while other papers were priced around six cents, it was only priced for a penny.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-penny-press-considered-an-original-product>Why is the penny press considered an original product?</h2>
<p>The penny press, Schudson argues, was a product of this new spirit of individualism in business enterprise and independence in politics. These penny papers were the first commercial papers, the first popular papers, the first politically independent papers, and the first ‘news’ papers.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-names-of-the-two-most-popular-penny-papers>What were the names of the two most popular penny papers?</h2>
<p>As many as 35 penny papers were founded in New York during the 1830s, but only two–Benjamin Day’s New York Sun and James Gordon Bennett’s New York Herald–managed to survive the decade.</p>
<h2 id=are-newspapers-becoming-obsolete>Are newspapers becoming obsolete?</h2>
<p>Newspapers are in terminal decline So each year, a few million newspaper readers die and are not replaced by new readers. In the 1990s, many cities had only one major newspaper, and that newspaper was often the best way for local businesses to reach customers. So newspapers could charge premium rates for ads.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-newspaper-or-internet>Which is better newspaper or Internet?</h2>
<p>New report: Internet is more important than newspapers, but still not trustworthy. However, newspapers are affected more than magazines, books and other printed issues, because the main purpose of a newspaper is to inform the people about worldwide and local events.</p>
<h2 id=who-founded-the-new-york-herald-in-1835-with-only-500>Who founded the New York Herald in 1835 with only $500?</h2>
<p>That tradition dates to 1835, when a Scottish immigrant named James Gordon Bennett founded the New York Herald. He had $500 in capital, an office in a dank cellar, and only himself as staff. With a dozen other papers in the city, no one thought the Herald would amount to much.</p>
