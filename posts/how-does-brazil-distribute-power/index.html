<h2 id=how-is-electricity-produced-and-delivered-in-brazil>How is electricity produced and delivered in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Hydroelectricity makes up the bulk of Brazil’s generating capacity (87 GW), with the remainder provided by fossil fuel sources (30 GW), biomass (12 GW), and small amounts of wind and nuclear. Fossil fuels are Brazil’s second largest source of electricity.</p>
<h2 id=is-brazil-federal-or-unitary>Is Brazil federal or unitary?</h2>
<p>History. Brazil won its independence from Portugal in 1822 and initially became a monarchy with a unitary form of government. Slavery was abolished in 1888, and a republican alliance deposed the king in 1889, proclaiming Brazil a federal country.</p>
<h2 id=is-electricity-expensive-in-brazil>Is electricity expensive in Brazil?</h2>

<h2 id=does-brazil-have-access-to-electricity>Does Brazil have access to electricity?</h2>

<h2 id=how-much-electricity-does-brazil-use-per-capita>How much electricity does Brazil use per capita?</h2>
<p>Brazil is the largest electricity market in Latin America and the 7th largest in electricity generation capacity in the world, with 173.2 GW. Brazil generates and distributes electricity to over 85 million residential, commercial, and industrial consumers, more than all the combined power produced by other South American nations.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-government-do-they-have-in-brazil>What kind of government do they have in Brazil?</h2>
<p>The political and administrative organization of Brazil comprises the federal government, the 26 states and a federal district, and the municipalities.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-electricity-system-in-brazil-deregulated>How is the electricity system in Brazil deregulated?</h2>
<p>The Brazilian electricity model is fully deregulated, which allows generators to sell all of their “assured energy” via freely negotiated contracts with consumers above 3 MW or via energy auctions administered by CCEE (See energy auctions below). . Under this model, distributors are required to contract 100% of their expected demand. Currently]</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-executive-power-exercised-in-brazil>How is the executive power exercised in Brazil?</h2>
<p>The executive power is exercised by a governor elected to a four-year term. The judiciary is exercised by courts of first and second instance addressing the common justice. Each State has a unicameral legislature with deputies who vote on state laws. The Constitution of Brazil knows also two elements of direct democracy, stated in Article 14.</p>
