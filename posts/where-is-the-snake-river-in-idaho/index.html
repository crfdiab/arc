<h2 id=where-is-the-snake-river-in-idaho>Where is the Snake River in Idaho?</h2>
<p>The Snake River originates in Wyoming and arcs across southern Idaho before turning north along the Idaho-Oregon border. The river then enters Washington and flows west to the Columbia River. It is the Columbia’s largest tributary, an important source of irrigation water for potatoes, sugar beets, and other crops.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-the-pacific-ocean-get-its-name>How did the Pacific Ocean get its name?</h2>
<p>How did the Pacific Ocean get its name? How did the Pacific Ocean get its name? Explorer Ferdinand Magellan named the Pacific Ocean in the 16th Century. Covering approximately 59 million square miles and containing more than half of the free water on Earth, the Pacific is by far the largest of the world’s ocean basins.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-deepest-body-of-water-in-idaho>Which is the deepest body of water in Idaho?</h2>
<p>Lake Pend Oreille is Idaho’s largest, deepest, and quietest body of water, making it perfect for top-secret underwater missions. Pend Oreille’s depth (which is deeper than Loch Ness at close to 1150 feet), calm, crystal-clear waters, and chilly temperature mimics the open ocean without all of the hazards that come from military testing off shore.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-idaho-become-part-of-the-united-states>When did Idaho become part of the United States?</h2>
<p>The Territory of Idaho was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 3, 1863, until July 3, 1890, when the final extent of the territory was admitted to the Union as Idaho .

<h2 id=where-does-the-snake-river-drain-into-the-pacific-ocean>Where does the Snake River drain into the Pacific Ocean?</h2>
<p>The Snake River watershed is bounded by several other major North American watersheds, which drain both to the Atlantic or the Pacific, or into endorheic basins. On the southwest side a divide separates the Snake watershed from Oregon’s Harney Basin, which is endorheic.</p>
