<h2 id=when-did-the-british-outlaw-gaelic>When did the British outlaw Gaelic?</h2>
<p>1616<br>
Gaelic was introduced to Scotland from Ireland in the 5th century and remained the main language in most rural areas until the early 17th century. It was outlawed by the crown in 1616, and suppressed further after the Jacobite rebellion of 1745.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-irish-speaking-illegal>How long is Irish speaking illegal?</h2>
<p>It is believed that Irish remained the majority tongue as late as 1800 but became a minority language during the 19th century.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-english-language-take-over-ireland>When did English language take over Ireland?</h2>
<p>12th century<br>
English was brought to Ireland as a result of the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland of the late 12th century.</p>
<h2 id=is-gaelic-older-than-english>Is Gaelic older than English?</h2>
<p>The Irish language is almost a millennium older than English.</p>
<h2 id=is-gaelic-scottish-or-irish>Is Gaelic Scottish or Irish?</h2>
<p>The term “Gaelic”, as a language, applies only to the language of Scotland. If you’re not in Ireland, it is permissible to refer to the language as Irish Gaelic to differentiate it from Scottish Gaelic, but when you’re in the Emerald Isle, simply refer to the language as either Irish or its native name, Gaeilge.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-welsh-language-banned-in-court>When was the Welsh language banned in court?</h2>
<p>It was only in the 16th century that the Welsh language was banned from use in court. By Pádraig Óg Ó Ruairc. Constitutionally both Wales and Northern Ireland are considered part of the integral and sovereign territory of the United Kingdom governed by the same legal system.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-irish-language-banned-in-ireland>When was the Irish language banned in Ireland?</h2>
<p>The Statute of Kilkenny banned traditional Irish dress as well as use of the Irish language in 1367.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-speak-irish-in-wales>Is it illegal to speak Irish in Wales?</h2>
<p>Yet the use of Welsh, the indigenous language of Wales, is legal in Welsh Courts whilst the use of Irish, the indigenous language of Ireland, is illegal in the courts of Northern Ireland and is a crime punishable by a monetary fine or contempt of court ruling.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-irish-language-act-of-1737>What was the Irish Language Act of 1737?</h2>
<p>The Administration of Justice (Language) Act (Ireland) of 1737 forbids the speaking of Irish within the courtroom, and the completion of legal documentation in Irish and imposes a financial penalty of £20 each time Irish is spoken in court</p>
