<p>It was headed for Virginia, where the colonists, comprising religious dissenters and entrepreneurs, planned to settle. However, bad weather and navigational errors blew the Mayflower more than 500 miles off course.</p>
<h2 id=what-land-was-settled-by-the-pilgrims-and-puritans>What land was settled by the Pilgrims and Puritans?</h2>
<p>Plymouth Colony<br>
At its height, Plymouth Colony occupied most of the southeastern portion of Massachusetts. Plymouth Colony was founded by a group of Puritan Separatists initially known as the Brownist Emigration, who came to be known as the Pilgrims.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-mayflower-get-off-course>How did the Mayflower get off course?</h2>
<p>The explanation passed down by the Pilgrims was that a serious storm had blown the Mayflower off course, and that they had arrived in America too late in the year to correct themselves. Many people on the Mayflower were bonded out to the London Company for seven year terms of indentured servitude.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-pilgrims-and-puritans-come-from>Where did the pilgrims and Puritans come from?</h2>
<p>The Pilgrims or Pilgrim Fathers were the English settlers who established the Plymouth Colony in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Their leadership came from the religious congregations of Brownists, or Separatist Puritans, who had fled religious persecution in England for the tolerance of 17th-century Holland in…</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-pilgrims-intend-to-land-on-the-mayflower>Where did the pilgrims intend to land on the Mayflower?</h2>
<p>The Pilgrims intended to land in Northern Virginia and the Hudson River (today New York) was their intended destination. They had received good reports on this region while in the Netherlands. The Mayflower was almost right on target, missing the Hudson River by just a few degrees.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-pilgrims-land-in-new-england>When did the pilgrims land in New England?</h2>
<p>Did the Pilgrims intend to land at Plymouth? After more than two months at sea, the Pilgrims aboard the storm-tossed Mayflower finally spied the New England coastline as dawn broke on November 9, 1620.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-pilgrims-land-in-plymouth-rock>Where did the pilgrims land in Plymouth Rock?</h2>
<p>The Mayflower landed on Plymouth Rock in late 1620. They’d actually landed on Cape Cod in November and tried to sail south to their originally intended destination—The Virginia Colony, a fairly monstrous 220 miles south—eventually ending up in Plymouth Rock (despite the name, more of a stone than a rock).</p>
