<p>Mission Indians are the indigenous peoples of California who lived in Southern California and were forcibly relocated from their traditional dwellings, villages, and homelands to live and work at 15 Franciscan missions in Southern California and the Asistencias and Estancias established between 1796 and 1823 in the Las …</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-site-chosen-for-mission-san-luis-rey>Why was the site chosen for Mission San Luis Rey?</h2>
<p>Father Lasuen chose the San Luis Rey Mission site because there were lots of friendly Indians living in the area, but he also picked a place with good soil. Under the guidance of Father Antonio Peyri, who stayed here for more than thirty years, it soon became the most productive of all the California missions.</p>
<h2 id=what-native-people-lived-in-san-diego>What native people lived in San Diego?</h2>
<p>Five distinguishable American Indian groups are present in San Diego County at the time of Spanish contact: Luiseno, Cahuilla, Cupeno, Kumeyaay, and Northern Diegueño.

<p>The mission was named after Louis IX, a king of France during the 1200s. The size, population, and abundant crop production earned San Luis Rey Mission the nickname “King of the Missions.”</p>

<p>The type of indians living on the coastal region and in San Luis Rey De Francia were Luiseno indians. They adapted to the mission by living there and getting used to mission life. After long times, they would get sick and die.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-san-luis-rey-de-francia-get-its-name>How did San Luis Rey de Francia get its name?</h2>
<p>The community was named for Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, established in 1798, which is located near the geographic center of the neighborhood. This Mission at one point covered 950,000 acres and was tended by the Luiseno Indians, who were forcibly moved onto the Mission to work under the Spanish.</p>
