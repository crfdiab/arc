<h2 id=what-was-so-special-about-the-ohio-river-valley>What was so special about the Ohio River valley?</h2>
<p>During the 1800s, the Ohio River became an important commercial route for residents in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois. Farmers and manufacturers sent their crops and finished products on flatboats and barges downstream to the Mississippi River and eventually on to New Orleans.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-ohio-valley-become-the-area-of-conflict-between-the-french-and-british-in-america>Why did the Ohio valley become the area of conflict between the French and British in America?</h2>
<p>The French and Indian War, which took place between 1754-1763, began due to a conflict between England and France over control of the Ohio River Valley. Both sides wanted the valley so they could expand their settlements into the area.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-ohio-valley-important-to-the-french>Why was the Ohio Valley important to the French?</h2>
<p>The French recognized the strategic importance of the valley as a link in their far-flung empire, which stretched from New France, in Canada, to Louisiana, along the Mississippi River. On the other hand, English colonists from Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania hoped to settle the Ohio Valley area.”</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-french-trade-with-the-ohioans>How did the French trade with the Ohioans?</h2>
<p>Starting in this decade, British traders began to cross the Appalachian Mountains to trade with the Ohio Country’s Native Americans. From 1744 until 1748, Great Britain and France were engaged in King George’s War. During the conflict, Great Britain managed to blockade France’s colonies in North America.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-french-commander-in-the-ohio-river-valley>Who was the French commander in the Ohio River valley?</h2>
<p>Side A: In 1749, the French in North America perceived a threat by British expansion west of the Allegheny Mountains to the Ohio River Valley and beyond. The French commander, Pierre Joseph Celeron, sieur de Blainville, with 250 men, left Montreal, New France, to establish French claims.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-french-claim-the-ohio-country>How did the French claim the Ohio Country?</h2>
<p>On these plates were pronouncements that laid claim to the Ohio Country for France. At the places where major rivers joined the Ohio River, the party stopped and buried one of the tablets. On a nearby tree, a metal plaque was placed, asserting the claims of France and stating that the tablet lay nearby.</p>
