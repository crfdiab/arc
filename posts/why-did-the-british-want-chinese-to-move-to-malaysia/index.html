<h2 id=why-did-the-british-want-chinese-to-move-to-malaysia>Why did the British want Chinese to move to Malaysia?</h2>
<p>Malaysia had large deposits of tin and became the world’s leading rubber exporter. In need of workers, Britain encouraged Chinese to move to Malaysia. China had a lack of jobs, and most people became pour. When they heard about Malaysia needing farmers and miners, they immigrated immediately.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-chinese-move-to-malaysia>Why did Chinese move to Malaysia?</h2>
<p>Their main reasons for emigrating are better economic and career prospects abroad and a sense of social injustice within Malaysia. The large number of migrants, many of whom are young and highly educated, constitutes a significant brain drain from the country, especially towards Singapore.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-factors-that-made-chinese-to-migrate-to-malaya>What are the factors that made Chinese to migrate to Malaya?</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of large numbers of Chinese coolies flocking to Malaya after mid-19th century basically satisfies both the pull and push factors in Malaya and China respectively. Among China’s push factors were abject poverty and lack of arable lands for the local farmers resulting in very tough life for most people.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-malaysia-become-rich>How did Malaysia become rich?</h2>
<p>At one time, it was the largest producer of tin, rubber and palm oil in the world. Manufacturing has a large influence in the country’s economy, accounting for over 40% of the GDP. Malaysia is also the world’s largest Islamic banking and financial centre. Since the 1980s the industrial sector has led Malaysia’s growth.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-want-to-keep-malaysia-under-british-rule>Why did the British want to keep Malaysia under British rule?</h2>
<p>British officials believed that the rural Malay farmers needed to be protected from economic and cultural change and that traditional class divisions should be maintained. Hence, most economic development was left to Chinese and Indian immigrants, as long as it served long-term colonial interests.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-migrate-from-china-to-malaysia>Why did people migrate from China to Malaysia?</h2>
<p>Among China’s push factors were abject poverty and lack of arable lands for the local farmers resulting in very tough life for most people. After the Opium War, the Qing dynasty government began to loosen its grips on the long-standing coast control policy, giving coastal farmers extended freedom to exploit the opportunities beyond.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-great-britain-want-to-trade-with-china>Why did Great Britain want to trade with China?</h2>
<p>Goods such as porcelain, silk and tea drove Britain to trade with China. However, the Chinese had no interest in British manufactured goods and insisted on payment in silver. Because Britain had to buy silver from Europe and Mexico to finance its purchases of Chinese goods, the trade deficit became vast.</p>
