<h2 id=why-is-britain-so-cold>Why is Britain so cold?</h2>
<p>Temperature. The British Isles undergo very small temperature variations. This is due to its proximity to the Atlantic, which acts as a temperature buffer, warming the Isles in winter and cooling them in summer. Coastal areas tend to be more temperate than inland areas, as the influence of the ocean is less acute.</p>
