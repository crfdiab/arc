<h2 id=what-tools-did-the-huron-wendat-use>What tools did the Huron-Wendat use?</h2>
<p>3 Tools and Weapons Households required many basic tools. Huron wove baskets from hemp and long grasses and carved spoons and other utensils from wood or bark.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-iroquois-wipe-out-the-huron>Did the Iroquois wipe out the Huron?</h2>
<p>​The Iroquois eventually wiped out the Huron and the Petun who were a close ally of the Huron. Some other tribes the Iroquois wiped out were the Erie, Susquehannock. Remaining Erie, Huron, and other decimated tribes were absorbed by the Iroquois Confederacy.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-huron-wendat-hunt>What did the Huron-Wendat hunt?</h2>
<p>The Huron-Wendat were agricultural and therefore less. nomadic than the First Nations who relied on hunting for food. They grew corn, beans, squash and pumpkin. The corn was dried and pounded and sometimes made into a corn soup called sagamite.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-did-the-jumano-indians-eat>What kind of food did the Jumano Indians eat?</h2>
<p>Foods that Jumano Indians ate included corn, beans and dried squash. They also supplied their foods to other villages in exchange for meat, cactus fruits, pine nuts and pelts. The Jumano people were both farmers and buffalo hunters who were known to wear tattoos. Farming was their main source of food.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-did-the-sumerians-eat>What kind of food did the Sumerians eat?</h2>
<p>Lamb, goat, pork and fish were favorites with city-dwelling Sumerians, but rural farming communities did not eat meat often and lived on a mostly vegetarian diet. Sumerians mostly lived on barley products and vegetables. These items were often made into soups or enriched bread.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-did-the-huron-indians-eat>What kind of food did the Huron Indians eat?</h2>
<p>Waters were rich with sturgeon, pike, trout and whitefish. Though food was plentiful, the Huron processed and stored much of it in preparation for the long, cold winter months. They lived in rectangular barracks-style structures called longhouses, which doubled as food processing and storage facilities.</p>
<h2 id=what-foods-did-the-mayans-eat-in-ancient-times>What foods did the Mayans eat in ancient times?</h2>
<p>Fresh handmade tortillas are still in high demand in modern times because they are a delectable part of foods such as enchiladas and tacos, and are even sometimes enjoyed with nothing but fresh salsa.</p>
