<h2 id=does-an-anticyclone-have-high-air-pressure>Does an anticyclone have high air pressure?</h2>
<p>Areas of sinking air which result in high pressure are called anticyclones (the opposite to an anticyclone is the cyclone or depression, which is covered next). As the air sinks, it warms up, leading to warm and dry weather. …</p>
<h2 id=is-an-anticyclone-high-or-low-pressure>Is an anticyclone high or low pressure?</h2>
<p>As air masses move around the globe, so air pressure changes. Areas of high pressure are called anticyclones, whilst low pressure areas are known as cyclones or depressions.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-winds-flow-around-an-anticyclone>How do winds flow around an anticyclone?</h2>
<p>Winds Around Anticyclones: flow clockwise around the center in the northern hemisphere. Winds flow clockwise around a high pressure center in the northern hemisphere, while in the southern hemisphere, winds flow counterclockwise around a high.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-weather-does-low-air-pressure-bring>What type of weather does low air pressure bring?</h2>
<p>A low pressure system is a whirling mass of warm, moist air that generally brings stormy weather with strong winds. When viewed from above, winds spiral into a low-pressure center in a counterclockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-weather-does-an-anticyclone-bring>What type of weather does an anticyclone bring?</h2>
<p>Anticyclones can bring us very cold, crisp bright winter days and warm, sunny summer weather. In winter, the clear, settled conditions and light winds associated with anticyclones can lead to frost and fog. Sometimes in late winter or spring, the air near the ground cools so much that low cloud, or fog, can form.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-anticyclones-important-in-the-high-pressure-system>Why are anticyclones important in the high pressure system?</h2>
<p>Anticyclones often block the path of depressions, either slowing down the bad weather, or forcing it round the outside of the high pressure system. They are then called ‘ Blocking Highs ‘. As air descends, air pressure increases. When air hits the ground, it has to go somewhere.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-opposite-of-an-anticyclone>Which is the opposite of an anticyclone?</h2>
<p>Weather: anticyclones and depressions / 2.1 Anticyclones Areas of sinking air which result in high pressure are called anticyclones (the opposite to an anticyclone is the cyclone or depression, which is covered next). High pressure systems have small pressure gradients (ie the air pressure doesn’t change rapidly).</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-a-cyclone-in-the-northern-hemisphere>What do you call a cyclone in the northern hemisphere?</h2>
<p>In summary, for the Northern Hemisphere: Low pressure is called a cyclone and has anticlockwise winds blowing around it. High pressure is called an anticyclone and has clockwise winds blowing around it. The wind tends to blow along the pressure contours.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-anticyclones-different-from-depressions-and-depressions>How are anticyclones different from depressions and depressions?</h2>
<p>Anticyclones are much larger than depressions and produce periods of settled and calm weather lasting many days or weeks. Anticyclones often block the path of depressions, either slowing down the bad weather, or forcing it round the outside of the high pressure system. They are then called ‘ Blocking Highs ‘.</p>
