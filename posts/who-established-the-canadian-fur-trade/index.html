<h2 id=who-established-the-canadian-fur-trade>Who established the Canadian fur trade?</h2>
<p>The Métis are a recognized Indigenous people in Canada. Britain became the master of the fur trade in North America after it took control of New France in the 1760s. The most important fur trading companies were the Hudson’s Bay Company and the North West Company (NWC). The NWC was founded in 1779.</p>
<h2 id=who-established-a-fur-trade-with-natives>WHO established a fur trade with natives?</h2>
<p>The first Europeans to purchase furs from Indians were French and English fishermen who, during the 1500s, fished off the coast of northeastern Canada and occasionally traded with the Indians. In exchange, the Indians received European-manufactured goods such as guns, metal cooking utensils, and cloth.</p>
<h2 id=who-established-the-fur-trading-company>Who established the fur trading company?</h2>
<p>The American Fur Company (AFC) was founded in 1808, by John Jacob Astor, a German immigrant to the United States. During the 18th century, furs had become a major commodity in Europe, and North America became a major supplier.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-the-first-nations-trade-with-in-the-fur-trade>Who did the first nations trade with in the fur trade?</h2>
<p>The fur trade was based on good relationships between the First Nations peoples and the European traders. First Nations people gathered furs and brought them to posts to trade for textiles, tools, guns, and other goods. This exchange of goods for other items is called the barter system.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-largest-fur-trading-company>What was the largest fur trading company?</h2>
<p>Astor’s American Fur Company<br>
The largest of the companies in the United States was John Jacob Astor’s American Fur Company, which also came into conflict with the North West Company, notably in 1812–13 at the Pacific coast establishment of Astoria.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-fur-trade-negatively-impact-the-first-nations>How did the fur trade negatively impact the First Nations?</h2>
<p>The fur trade resulted in many long term effects that negatively impacted Native people throughout North America, such as starvation due to severely depleted food resources, dependence on European and Anglo-American goods, and negative impacts from the introduction of alcohol-which was often exchanged for furs.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-fur-trade-so-important-to-canada>Why was the fur trade so important to Canada?</h2>
<p>The intensely competitive trade opened the continent to exploration and settlement. It financed missionary work, established social, economic and colonial relationships between Europeans and Indigenous people, and played a formative role in the creation and development of Canada.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-fur-trade-start-in-canada>Where did the fur trade start in Canada?</h2>
<p>The Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) was a British mercantile company established in 1670. The HBC was granted exclusive trading rights to the area known as Rupertsland (modern day western Canada) by the British Crown. The Northwest Company (NWC) was a fur trade company based in Montreal.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-fur-trade-company>What was the name of the fur trade company?</h2>
<p>The Northwest Company (NWC) was a fur trade company based in Montreal. The NWC was established in 1779 and rivaled the London based HBC in the Canadian fur trade, however, in 1821 the NWC merged with the HBC under the name and direction of the latter.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-fur-trade-help-indigenous-people>How did the fur trade help indigenous people?</h2>
<p>In the interior, however, the traders quickly formed alliances with Indigenous women, whose economic skills helped the French adapt to wilderness life. Women made clothing and moccasins and helped to supply the fur trade posts. Most importantly, they fostered kinship ties between Europeans and Indigenous peoples,…</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-the-hbc-in-the-fur-trade>What was the role of the HBC in the fur trade?</h2>
<p>The charter granted the company a monopoly of trade in the Bay and ownership of all lands drained by rivers flowing into the Bay. The HBC established an English presence in the Northwest and a competitive route to the fur trade centred on Montréal. Charles Bayly founded Moose Fort, which would later become Moose Factory.</p>
