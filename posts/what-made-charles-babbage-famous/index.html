<p>Charles Babbage, (born December 26, 1791, London, England—died October 18, 1871, London), English mathematician and inventor who is credited with having conceived the first automatic digital computer. The idea of mechanically calculating mathematical tables first came to Babbage in 1812 or 1813.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-charles-babbage-invent-computer>When did Charles Babbage invent computer?</h2>
<p>In 1821 Babbage invented the Difference Engine to compile mathematical tables. On completing it in 1832, he conceived the idea of a better machine that could perform not just one mathematical task but any kind of calculation.</p>

<p>Charles Babbage (1791-1871), computer pioneer, designed the first automatic computing engines. He invented computers but failed to build them. The first complete Babbage Engine was completed in London in 2002, 153 years after it was designed.</p>

<p>English mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage is credited with having conceived the first automatic digital computer. During the mid-1830s Babbage developed plans for the Analytical Engine.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-charles-babbage-stop-building-his-machines>When did Charles Babbage stop building his machines?</h2>
<p>The government decided to stop funding the projects in 1842. Between 1846 and 1849 Babbage designed a new improved difference engine (Difference Engine No. 2) His machines were considered as one of the very first mechanical computers ever to be invented.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-charles-babbage-invent-the-analytical-engine>When did Charles Babbage invent the Analytical Engine?</h2>
<p>During the mid-1830s Babbage developed plans for the Analytical Engine, the forerunner of the modern digital computer. In that device he envisioned the capability of performing any arithmetical operation on the basis of instructions from punched cards, a memory unit in which to store numbers,…</p>
