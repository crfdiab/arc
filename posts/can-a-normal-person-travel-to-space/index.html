<p>Spaceflight still isn’t an endeavor the average person could be expected to handle without rigorous training. It’s not like taking a flight across the globe. There are intense physical rigors involved in riding a rocket into orbit and living in microgravity for more than a few days.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-benefits-of-space-tourism>What are the benefits of space tourism?</h2>
<p>Why Space Tourism?</p>
<ul>
<li>Space Tourism is Price-Elastic with Regard to Launch Costs.</li>
<li>Space Tourism Connects People to Space in a Personal Way.</li>
<li>Space Tourism is a Great Way for Billionaires to Spend Their Money.</li>
<li>Suborbital Tourism Will Benefit Orbital Space Tourism.</li>
<li>Space Tourism Will Not Be a Pollution Disaster.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-space-travel>What are the pros and cons of space travel?</h2>
<p>Top 10 Space Exploration Pros & Cons – Summary List</p>
<table><tr><th>Space Exploration Pros</th><th>Space Exploration Cons</th></tr><tr><td>Humans are curious creatures</td><td>Space travel can be dangerous</td></tr><tr><td>Space travel provides endless opportunities</td><td>Implies significant air pollution</td></tr><tr><td>Humans can learn humility from space travel</td><td>Space travel implies waste production</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-much-money-do-you-need-to-go-to-space>How much money do you need to go to space?</h2>
<p>On the day that billionaire Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos goes to space it’s worth knowing that a ticket to reach space can cost as much as $55 million for a “proper” orbital flight and a visit to the International Space Station (ISS)—and as little as nothing at all.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-space-tourism-exists-today>What kind of space tourism exists today?</h2>
<p>Space tourism is human space travel for recreational purposes. There are several different types of space tourism, including orbital, suborbital and lunar space tourism. Work also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-common-for-people-to-go-to-space>Is it common for people to go to space?</h2>
<p>Ever since humans set foot on the moon, the goal has been to travel further into the giant void of space. Over 50 years later, and we are not quite there yet. But Hollywood blockbusters portray space travel as a common thing, often featuring people with their own private shuttles.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-plans-to-send-civilians-to-space>Are there any plans to send civilians to space?</h2>
<p>But Hollywood blockbusters portray space travel as a common thing, often featuring people with their own private shuttles. There are plans to send astronauts to Mars, though, which will make it the furthest that professional space travelers have ever gone. For civilians, we just have to live vicariously through NASA.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-any-commercial-use-for-space-travel>Is there any commercial use for space travel?</h2>
<p>Space is no longer just for governments. In just a few decades, it has gone from a tool of the Cold War to a field where private companies are blossoming and new applications are developed with fierce pace.</p>
<p>Space travelers are likely to get exposed to harmful radiations from the sun. Lack of proper regulation and inadequate safety protocols can make space travel extremely dangerous. Companies engaged in this form of travel may fail to stick to safety measures in a spree to gather more customers.</p>
