<p>The Snake River begins its journey from the western side of the state of Wyoming and flows across the Snake River Plain in the southern part of Idaho.

<p>I would not recommend swimming in the Snake River because it is a deep, big, powerful river and may look calm but there are a lot of undercurrents. People drown each year in Idaho because of swimming in the Snake and getting sucked under. Your best bet is to be in a boat on the Snake.</p>

<h2 id=where-does-the-energy-from-the-snake-river-come-from>Where does the energy from the Snake River come from?</h2>
<p>The Columbia-Snake river system, a 365-mile federal waterway from Lewiston, Idaho to Portland, Oregon, enables inland farmers to sell their crops to feed the world. Hydropower delivers carbon-free energy to more than 60% of people in the Pacific Northwest. Most of it comes from dams on the Snake and Columbia rivers.</p>
