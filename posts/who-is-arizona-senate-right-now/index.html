<h2 id=how-many-senate-seats-does-each-state-get>How many Senate seats does each state get?</h2>

<h2 id=how-often-are-senators-up-for-reelection>How often are senators up for reelection?</h2>

<h2 id=how-many-members-of-the-us-senate-are-there>How many members of the US Senate are there?</h2>
<p>There are a total of 535 Members of Congress. 100 serve in the U.S. Senate, and 435 serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. Each state sends two Senators to represent their state in the U.S. Senate.</p>
<h2 id=when-are-the-us-senate-seats-up-for-reelection>When are the US Senate seats up for reelection?</h2>
<p>The winners of those seats will serve a six-year term from January 3, 2023, until January 3, 2029. Elections to the Senate are staggered over even years so that only about 1/3 of the Senate is up for reelection during any election. To contact your Senator click here.</p>

<p>But even Joni Ernst, the state’s junior GOP senator, who was in a top-targeted seat last year, won reelection by more than 6 points. Similarly, Missouri looks to have become more solidly red since GOP Sen. Roy Blunt defeated Democrat Jason Kander by less than 3 points in 2016, which was a presidential year.</p>
