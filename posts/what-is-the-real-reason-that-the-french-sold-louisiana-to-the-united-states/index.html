<h2 id=what-is-the-real-reason-that-the-french-sold-louisiana-to-the-united-states>What is the real reason that the French sold Louisiana to the United States?</h2>
<p>The Louisiana Purchase Was Driven by a Slave Rebellion. Napoleon was eager to sell—but the purchase would end up expanding slavery in the U.S. Slaves revolting against French power in Haiti.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-they-sell-louisiana-to-the-united-states>Why did they sell Louisiana to the United States?</h2>
<p>The Kingdom of France had controlled the Louisiana territory from 1699 until it was ceded to Spain in 1762. However, France’s failure to put down a revolt in Saint-Domingue, coupled with the prospect of renewed warfare with the United Kingdom, prompted Napoleon to consider selling Louisiana to the United States.</p>

<p>Why did Napoleon sell the Louisiana Purchase to the United States? He needed money for military supplies as his country was at war with Great Britain, and he hoped that a larger U.S would challenge British power. The United States roughly doubled in size.</p>

<p>By selling Louisiana to the U.S. in 1803, Napoleon obviated the need to defend it against the British, and he may have hoped that the need of the U.S. to defend the territory (against the British) might have brought America back to its alliance with France. Napoleon had pinned his hopes on victory in Europe.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-of-an-increase-was-the-louisiana-territory-to-the-united-states>How much of an increase was the Louisiana Territory to the United States?</h2>
<p>The acquisition of approximately 827,000 square miles would double the size of the United States. Though rumors of the purchase preceded notification from Monroe and Livingston, their message reached Washington in time for an official announcement on July 4, 1803.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-us-and-france-conclude-the-louisiana-purchase>When did the US and France conclude the Louisiana Purchase?</h2>
<p>United States and France conclude the Louisiana Purchase On April 30, 1803, representatives of the United States and Napoleonic France conclude negotiations for the Louisiana Purchase, a massive land sale that doubles the size of the young American republic.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-purchase-of-louisiana-by-jefferson>How big was the purchase of Louisiana by Jefferson?</h2>
<h2 id=who-was-frances-foreign-minister-during-the-louisiana-purchase>Who was France’s foreign minister during the Louisiana Purchase?</h2>
<p>Napoleon agreed. On April 11, Foreign Minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand told Livingston that France was willing to sell all of Louisiana. Livingston informed Monroe upon his arrival the next day.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-louisiana-purchase-affect-the-slave-trade>How did the Louisiana Purchase affect the slave trade?</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Louisiana, which also became a state after the purchase, remained a slave state, and New Orleans remained a critical hub of the slave trade. So while a slave rebellion helped drive the Louisiana Purchase, the new territory was destined to become a place of suffering and exploitation for the thousands of slaves forced to work there.</p>
