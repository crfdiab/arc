<p>Lake Baikal<br>
Situated in south-east Siberia, the 3.15-million-ha Lake Baikal is the oldest (25 million years) and deepest (1,700 m) lake in the world. It contains 20% of the world’s total unfrozen freshwater reserve.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-largest-freshwater-lake-in-the-world>Where is the largest freshwater lake in the world?</h2>
<p>Lake Baikal, Russia | WWF. So large that it is often mistaken for a sea, Russia’s Lake Baikal is the deepest and oldest lake in the world, and the largest freshwater lake by volume.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-deepest-freshwater-lake-in-the-world>Which is the deepest freshwater lake in the world?</h2>
<p>Deepest Freshwater Lake in the World. To be precise it is 1,642 metres (5,387 feet) at its deepest point, which is deep enough to stand five Eiffel Towers (each 324 metres/1,063 feet) on top of one another and for the top-most tower to still not break the surface.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-lake-in-the-world-by-volume>Which is the largest lake in the world by volume?</h2>
<p>Lake Baikal in Russia is the largest lake on Earth when measured by volume. Plunging over 1,632 meters deep, it is both the deepest and the oldest lake in the world, with many arguing that it should be deemed a sea.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-purest-lake-in-the-world>Which is the purest lake in the world?</h2>
<p>Today Lake Baikal contains an astonishing 20 per cent of the world’s unfrozen fresh water, which is still very pure despite pollution from a coastal paper mill and where the Selenga River feeds into the lake.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-freshwater-lake-in-africa>Which is the largest freshwater lake in Africa?</h2>
<p>One of the African Great Lakes, Lake Victoria is the largest freshwater lake in Africa, spreading across Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya. It is also the largest tropical lake on Earth and the second largest freshwater lake by surface area – beaten only by Lake Superior.</p>
