<h2 id=what-caused-disputes-between-the-states>What caused disputes between the states?</h2>
<p>What caused disputes between the thirteen American states during and after the Revolutionary War? Land claims made by certain states on the western territories Congress’s decision to raise high taxes The Southern states’ proposal to form a separate nation.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-united-states-have-serious-money-issues-under-the-articles-of-confederation>Why did the United States have serious money issues under the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems was that the national government had no power to impose taxes. To avoid any perception of “taxation without representation,” the Articles of Confederation allowed only state governments to levy taxes. To pay for its expenses, the national government had to request money from the states.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-articles-of-confederation-resolve-disputes>How did the Articles of Confederation resolve disputes?</h2>
<p>There was no effective way to resolve disputes between states, such as competing claims to the same territory. Passing laws required the approval of nine states, and amending the Articles required the approval of all thirteen states. It was difficult to get enough consensus to make laws and nearly impossible to fix the Articles themselves.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-weakness-of-the-articles-of-confederation>What was the weakness of the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>A high-level overview of the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, which led states to call for a convention to revise or replace them. The Articles of Confederation formed the first governing system of the United States of America, which linked the states during the turbulent years of the American Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-rebellion-of-debt-ridden-farmers-led-by>Who was the rebellion of debt ridden farmers led by?</h2>
<p>A rebellion of debt-ridden farmers was led by: Daniel Shays Under the articles of Confederation, Congress had no power to Collect taxes Under the articles of confederation The states were superior to the national government What led to a serious dispute between the large and small states under the articles of confederation</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-articles-of-confederation-balance-power>How did the Articles of Confederation balance power?</h2>
<p>Balancing state and national power: The Articles of Confederation created a national governing system that placed most power in the hands of the states. The Founders feared giving too much power to a central government, which might become tyrannical.</p>
