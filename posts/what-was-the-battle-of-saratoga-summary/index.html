<p>The Battle of Saratoga occurred in September and October, 1777, during the second year of the American Revolution. It included two crucial battles, fought eighteen days apart, and was a decisive victory for the Continental Army and a crucial turning point in the Revolutionary War.</p>

It also increased Gates’s popularity—so much so that he was being considered to replace George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army.</p>

<p>The Patriot victory at Saratoga is often seen as the turning point in the war. Not only did it renew the morale of the American public, but it convinced potential foreign partners, such as France, that American could win the war, and that it might be in their best interests to send aid. France declared war on England.</p>

<p>The Battle of Saratoga was a turning point in the Revolutionary War. The American defeat of the superior British army lifted patriot morale, furthered the hope for independence, and helped to secure the foreign support needed to win the war.</p>

<p>The Americans under General Gates pursued the British army. Within days, they had them surrounded. The British surrendered on October 17, 1777. The Battles of Saratoga and the surrender of the British army under General Burgoyne was one of the major turning points of the Revolutionary War.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-underdog-that-won-the-battle-of-saratoga>Who was the underdog that won the Battle of Saratoga?</h2>

<p>American general Benedict Arnold was hailed as a hero for his bravery on the battlefield, a reputation lost with his later betrayal and defection to the Royalists. In 1777, British strategy called for a three-pronged attack on New York, with three separate armies converging near Albany.</p>
