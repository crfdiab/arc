<h2 id=what-were-medieval-fairs-called>What were medieval fairs called?</h2>
<p>These spellings originate from the Middle English feire (variant spellings include feyre, faire, and fayre), which comes from the Anglo-French word feire. They can also be referred to as “Elizabethan”, “Medieval”, or “Tudor” fairs or festivals. “Ren Fair” and “Ren Fest” are popular colloquialisms.</p>
<h2 id=when-were-medieval-fairs-held>When were medieval fairs held?</h2>
<p>Many charter fairs date back to the Middle Ages, with their heyday occurring during the 13th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-champagne-fairs>What was the purpose of the Champagne fairs?</h2>
<p>The Champagne fairs, sited on ancient land routes and largely self-regulated through the development of the Lex mercatoria (“merchant law”), became an important engine in the reviving economic history of medieval Europe, “veritable nerve centers” serving as a premier market for textiles, leather, fur, and spices.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-purpose-of-a-medieval-festival>What is the main purpose of a medieval festival?</h2>
<p>The medieval festivals emerged in the Middle Age. They were the place where people from all walks of life gathered in order to exchange products and goods. Their main purpose was trade and they existed since the commerce started as an activity between people.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-wear-to-renn-faire>What do you wear to Renn Faire?</h2>
<p>Most men choose to wear full-length breeches or half-length breeches with socks tucked into simple leather boots. For summer Ren Faires, tights would be uncomfortably warm anyway. DON’T dress as a pirate!, Trekkie, mermaid, elf, unless its’ that kind of Renaissance Faire.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-a-knight-in-the-middle-ages>What was life like for a knight in the Middle Ages?</h2>
<p>The Daily life of a Knight during the Middle ages centred around castles or Manors or fighting for his lord and the King during times of war. Much of his time was spent on honing his weapons skills and keeping his levels of fitness high.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-would-trading-take-at-a-middle-ages-fair>How long would Trading take at a Middle Ages fair?</h2>
<p>Trade Fairs: Fairs lasted for up to two weeks at a time. Traders had to get permission, either a grant from the king or fief owner. There was often a tax that the traders had to pay to the land owner to be able to sell. Sellers were basically renting the space to use.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-in-a-typical-medieval-village>What was in a typical medieval village?</h2>
<p>Most medieval villages would have a village green, a well for the drinking water, stables for horses, a stream in which to fish, a blacksmith, carpenters house, beehives and the all-important medieval inn were a medieval people could drink away all their problems with a jug of ale.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-point-of-jousting>What is the point of jousting?</h2>
<p>The primary aim was to replicate a clash of heavy cavalry, with each participant trying hard to strike the opponent while riding towards him at high speed, breaking the lance on the opponent’s shield or jousting armour if possible, or unhorsing him.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-peasants-celebrate>What did peasants celebrate?</h2>
<p>During the holiday season about 30 peasants would gather to celebrate the holiday (Duby 167). Most of the holidays were religious based; the most popular of them were Christmas, May Day, and Easter (Diehl 6).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-this-the-dark-ages>What is this, the Dark Ages?</h2>
<p>Answer: The “Dark Ages” are commonly considered to be the early part of the period known as the Middle Ages. Often the term Dark Ages refers to the initial five hundred years following the fall of Rome in 476.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-important-event-in-the-dark-ages>What was the most important event in the Dark Ages?</h2>
<p>There were many events that shaped the Dark Ages in Europe. Those events include: The First Crusade: (This drawing portrays the final battle for Jerusalem) The first crusade was ignited by a speech given by Pope Urban II in France in 1095.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-famine-in-the-dark-ages>Why was there famine in the Dark Ages?</h2>
<p>The overwhelming cold, the cold that stole up on Europe on little kitten feet stole food right out of the mouths of sleeping children. The trouble with famine is that it’s really, really hard to think about scientific discovery and art and mathematics and culture when it’s all you can do to survive. People started to drop like flies.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-dark-ages-a-time-of-religious-conflict>Why was the Dark Ages a time of religious conflict?</h2>
<p>Religious conflicts arose; Muslims conquered lands. Scarcity of sound literature and cultural achievements marked these years; barbarous practices prevailed. Despite the religious conflicts, the period of the Dark Ages was seen as an age of faith.</p>
