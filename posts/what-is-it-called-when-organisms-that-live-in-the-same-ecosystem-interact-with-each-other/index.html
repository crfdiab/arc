<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-organisms-that-live-in-the-same-ecosystem-interact-with-each-other>What is it called when organisms that live in the same ecosystem interact with each other?</h2>
<p>Species interactions within ecological webs include four main types of two-way interactions: mutualism, commensalism, competition, and predation (which includes herbivory and parasitism). Because of the many linkages among species within a food web, changes to one species can have far-reaching effects.</p>

<h2 id=amensalism-when-two-or-more-organisms-try-and-use-the-same-limited-resource>Amensalism. When two or more organisms try and use the same limited resource?</h2>
<p>When two or more individuals or populations try to use the same limited resources such as food, water, shelter, space, or sunlight, it is called competition.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-lowest-trophic-level-in-an-ecosystem>What is the lowest trophic level in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>primary producers<br>
Plants and algae comprise the lowest level of the trophic system. Called primary producers or autotrophs, plants and other organisms create their own food using photosynthesis. By using energy gleaned from the sun and nutrients gathered from the soil or water, plants and algae can manufacture food.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-two-organisms-rely-on-the-same-limited-resource>What happens if two organisms rely on the same limited resource?</h2>
<p>Competition is a relationship between organisms that strive for the same limited resources. Interspecific competition often leads to extinction of one species. However, it may lead to greater specialization of the species, allowing them to co-exist without competing.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-biotic-and-nonliving-parts-of-an-ecosystem>What are the biotic and nonliving parts of an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Ecosystems contain biotic or living, parts, as well as abiotic factors, or nonliving parts. Biotic factors include plants, animals, and other organisms. Abiotic factors include rocks, temperature, and humidity. Every factor in an ecosystem depends on every other factor, either directly or indirectly.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-living-organisms-dependent-on-one-another>How are living organisms dependent on one another?</h2>
<p>If there is only one thing you learn about ecosystems, it should be that all of the living residents of an ecosystem are dependent upon one another for their survival. But what does that dependence look like? Each organism living in an ecosystem plays an important role in the flow of energ y within the food web.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-every-living-creature-play-a-role-in-an-ecosystem>How does every living creature play a role in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Every living creature in an ecosystem has a role to play. Without producers, consumers and decomposers would not survive because they would have no food to eat. Without consumers, the populations of producers and decomposers would grow out of control. And without decomposers, producers and consumers would soon become buried in their own waste.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-an-organism-that-cannot-make-its-own-food>Which is an example of an organism that cannot make its own food?</h2>
<p>An organism that can not make it’s own food and must eat another organism. Examples of consumers People and animals Heterotroph an organism that needs to get its own food by eating another organism.</p>
