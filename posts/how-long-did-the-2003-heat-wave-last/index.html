<p>The severe heat wave began in Europe in June 2003 and continued through July until mid-August, raising summer temperatures 20 to 30% higher than the seasonal average in Celsius degrees over a large portion of the continent, extend- ing from northern Spain to the Czech Republic and from Germany to Italy (see map below).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-hottest-day-in-2003>What was the hottest day in 2003?</h2>

<p>15,000 deaths<br>
When the heat wave that hit France in 2003 led to more than 15,000 deaths due to the record temperature of 111.4 degrees Fahrenheit, authorities knew they needed to be prepared should extreme weather happen again. This past summer, it did: Temperatures reached a national record of 114.8 F.</p>

<p>Heatwaves are among the most dangerous of natural hazards, but rarely receive adequate attention because their death tolls and destruction are not always immediately obvious. From 1998-2017, more than 166 000 people died due to heatwaves, including more than 70 000 who died during the 2003 heatwave in Europe.</p>

<p>heat wave<br>
In the summer of 2003, when temperatures soared above 100 degrees throughout western Europe, the heat wave killed more than 14,800 in France alone and 35,000 people across the continent. It was the most intense heat Europe had seen in more than 500 years.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-hottest-summer-in-europe-in-2003>What was the hottest summer in Europe in 2003?</h2>
<p>2003 European heat wave. The 2003 European heat wave led to the hottest summer on record in Europe since at least 1540.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-worst-hit-by-the-2003-heat-wave>Where was the worst hit by the 2003 heat wave?</h2>
<p>Portugal was the worst hit with 390 146 ha burned, destroying around 5.6 % of its forest area. Spain came second with 127 525 ha burned. The agricultural area burned reached 44(1)123 ha plus 8,973 ha of unoccupied land, and 1 700 ha of inhabited areas. This was by far the worst forest fire season that Portugal had faced in the last 23 years.</p>

<p>Initially, 141 deaths were attributed to the heat wave in Spain. A further research of INE estimated a 12,963 excess of deaths during summer of 2003. Temperature records were broken in various cities, with the heat wave being more felt in typically cooler northern Spain.</p>
