<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-hurricanes-on-the-environment>What are the effects of hurricanes on the environment?</h2>
<p>Hurricanes’ environmental effects go beyond fish kills. Strong winds and flooding can uproot plants and kill land animals, devastating natural areas. Hurricanes may also destroy energy and chemical production facilities, gas stations, and other businesses, causing the release of toxic chemicals and pollutants into the environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-rainforest-after-a-hurricane>What happens to the rainforest after a hurricane?</h2>
<p>Flying over a rainforest after a hurricane often reveals that the canopy layer is completely gone, which impacts the lives of birds and animals that had formerly used the area directly beneath that canopy as their habitat. Wooded areas, such as swamps and marshes, undergo significant destruction as winds uproot and demolish trees.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-animals-effected-by-a-hurricane>How are animals effected by a hurricane?</h2>
<p>Animals can be killed by hurricanes or effected directly by habitat change and/or lack of food availability. Endangered species can be greatly affected, the population can be cut in half and possibly wiped out by a single hurricane.The powerful winds of a hurricane may cause salty ocean water to pile up and surge onshore.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-effect-of-hurricane-andrew-on-the-environment>What was the effect of Hurricane Andrew on the environment?</h2>
<p>However, the environmental effects are less well-known. In south Florida, Hurricane Andrew completely stripped vegetation from the northernmost Florida Keys. In the case of mangrove trees, defoliation and wood damage killed large old stands along the shoreline.</p>

<p>Image credit: USFWS. In addition to impacting individuals, homes, and communities, hurricanes also have a profound effect on the environment, especially estuarine and coastal habitats. Hurricanes generate strong winds that can completely defoliate forest canopies and cause dramatic structural changes in wooded ecosystems.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-people-when-a-hurricane-hits>What happens to people when a hurricane hits?</h2>
<p>With hurricanes also comes heavy rainfall which causes areas to flood, washing away anything in sight. studies show that the crime rate raises after hurricanes due to peoples desperation to survive. If you are lucky enough to survive a hurricane you are very likely to develop pneumonia.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-hurricanes-to-happen-in-the-world>What causes Hurricanes to happen in the world?</h2>
<p>Here’s a look at what causes hurricanes and how to address the threat of a wetter, windier world. What Causes a Hurricane? Pounding rain, raging winds, and devastating storm surge. When hurricanes make landfall, they bring a trifecta of threats capable of leveling communities and destroying lives and livelihoods.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-low-income-people-more-susceptible-to-hurricanes>Why are low income people more susceptible to hurricanes?</h2>
<p>First, lower income Americans are more likely to live in neighborhoods or buildings more susceptible to storm shocks. Substandard infrastructure in affordable housing units and low-income communities place residents at greater risk to the effects of a severe storm.</p>
