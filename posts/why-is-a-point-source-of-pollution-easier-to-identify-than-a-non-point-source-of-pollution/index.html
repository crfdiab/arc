<h2 id=why-is-a-point-source-of-pollution-easier-to-identify-than-a-non-point-source-of-pollution>Why is a point source of pollution easier to identify than a non point source of pollution?</h2>
<p>Point-source pollution is easy to identify. As the name suggests, it comes from a single place. Nonpoint-source pollution is harder to identify and harder to address. It is pollution that comes from many places, all at once.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-point-source-and-a-nonpoint-source-of-water-pollution>What is the difference between a point source and a nonpoint source of water pollution?</h2>
<p>Explanation: Point sources are for example, water discharging from an industrial plant of some kind or a waste water treatment plant. Non-point sources include run-off from agricultural lands that may wash fertilizer or other chemicals into lakes or rivers – this may occur over thousands of square kilometres.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-point-and-non-point-sources-of-water-pollution>What are point and non point sources of water pollution?</h2>
<p>It is in contrast to point source pollution which results from a single source. Nonpoint source pollution generally results from land runoff, precipitation, atmospheric deposition, drainage, seepage, or hydrological modification (rainfall and snowmelt) where tracing pollution back to a single source is difficult.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-example-of-non-point-pollution>What is an example of non point pollution?</h2>
<p>Nonpoint source pollution can include: Excess fertilizers, herbicides and insecticides from agricultural lands and residential areas. Oil, grease and toxic chemicals from urban runoff and energy production. Sediment from improperly managed construction sites, crop and forest lands, and eroding streambanks.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-is-the-best-example-of-non-point-source-pollution>Which of the following is the best example of non-point source pollution?</h2>
<p>Sewage water outlet is the best example of non-point pollution.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-harder-to-identify-point-source-or-nonpoint-source>Which is harder to identify, point source or nonpoint source?</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, it comes from a single place. Nonpoint-source pollution is harder to identify and harder to address. It is pollution that comes from many places, all at once.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-point-source-and-nonpoint-source-pollution>What’s the difference between point source and nonpoint source pollution?</h2>
<h2 id=which-is-the-opposite-of-a-point-source>Which is the opposite of a point source?</h2>
<p>Nutrients can cause a rampant growth of algae in water. Nonpoint-source pollution is the opposite of point-source pollution, with pollutants released in a wide area. As an example, picture a city street during a thunderstorm.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-point-source>What does it mean to be a point source?</h2>
<p>Under the NPDES program, factories, sewage treatment plants, and other point sources must obtain a permit from the state and EPA before they can discharge their waste or effluents into any body of water. Prior to discharge, the point source must use the latest technologies available to treat its effluents and reduce the level of pollutants.</p>
