<h2 id=what-were-the-positive-effects-of-british-rule-in-india>What were the positive effects of British rule in India?</h2>
<p>The British, by building a national infrastructure of rails and telegraphs and by ruling the country as a single unit, did bring relative peace and unity to India. They also increased India’s presence on the stage of global trade, which benefited some upper-class Indians.</p>
<h2 id=what-benefits-did-the-british-bring-to-india>What benefits did the British bring to India?</h2>
<p>In the Cause of Humanity: Abolition of suttee and infanticide. Destruction of Dacoits, Thugs, Pindarees, and other such pests of Indian society. Allowing remarriage of Hindu widows, and charitable aid in time of famine.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-positive-effects-of-british-rule-in-india>What are two positive effects of British rule in India?</h2>
<p>The British improved the Indian economy and helped Indians get out of poverty. The British helped empower women by banning certain unfair practices. hon invoduced parliamentary democracy and railways in India.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-british-rule-benefit-india>Did the British rule benefit India?</h2>
<p>Some recent research suggests that British rule did little for India in economic terms. Britain gained hugely from ruling India, but most of the wealth created was not invested back into the country. For example, from 1860 to about 1920, economic growth in India was very slow – much slower than in Britain or America.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-british-in-india>What was the impact of the British in India?</h2>
<p>The British presence in India was one of the most controversial of all of their colonizations. Many believe it was positive for the country, others believe it was not. However, the positives far outweigh the negatives: Better infrastructure, Western education, and the British bringing political peace and order.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-positive-effects-of-the-british-empire>What are the positive effects of the British Empire?</h2>
<p>Answer Among what may be viewed as the positive effects of the British empire are the same phenomena which comprise the benefits of globalisation in the contemporary world, which British imperial rule helped to create and accelerate.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-industrial-revolution-affect-british-imperialism>How did the Industrial Revolution affect British imperialism?</h2>
<p>In fact, the factories in England that emerged during the Industrial Revolution came to play an important role in British imperialism in India . This is because India served two important functions for Industrial England. First, Britain viewed India as a source of raw materials that could be used to fuel the factories in England.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-colonization-of-india>What was the result of the colonization of India?</h2>
<p>Many positive things happened during, and as a result of, the British colonization of India. When the East India Company took control of India in 1612, they began modernizing, westernizing, and industrializing India.</p>
