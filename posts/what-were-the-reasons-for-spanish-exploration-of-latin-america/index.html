<h2 id=what-were-the-reasons-for-spanish-exploration-of-latin-america>What were the reasons for Spanish exploration of Latin America?</h2>
<p>The Spanish Empire The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the Christian faith through indigenous conversions. The Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de Leon was an early invader of the Americas, traveling to the New World on Columbus’ second voyage.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-spanish-exploration-affect-latin-america>How did Spanish exploration affect Latin America?</h2>
<p>This involved an exchange of plants, goods, ideas, and diseases from Europe to the Americas. This exchange benefitted Europeans more than Native Americans because Europeans spread smallpox , a deadly disease, to Native Americans when they came into contact with them.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-spanish-explorer-to-explore-america>Who was the first Spanish explorer to explore America?</h2>
<p>In 1509, he started a colony at Caparra, later abandoned in favor of San Juan. He was one of the first of the adelantados — men who “advanced” the Spanish Empire by conquest, subjugation of the Indians, and the establishment of quasi-military government.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-spanish-call-the-land-they-explored>What did the Spanish call the land they explored?</h2>
<p>Captain Alonso Alvarez de Pineda circled west and south around the coast from Florida to Vera Cruz. He named the land off his starboard bow “Amichel”; he called what was probably the Mississippi River “Rio del Espíritu Santo”; and he recommended a settlement at the mouth of the “Rio de las Palmas” — possibly the Rio Grande.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-pineda-expedition-important-to-the-spanish>Why was the Pineda expedition important to the Spanish?</h2>
<p>The Pineda expedition was the inspiration of Francisco de Garay, Governor of Jamaica. He placed four vessels under the command of Pineda and ordered him to find a water passage around or through the landmass whose existence had been indicated by a series of Spanish explorations during the period 1515-18.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-spanish-discover-the-pacific-ocean>Where did the Spanish discover the Pacific Ocean?</h2>
<p>In 1510, the Spaniards occupied Jamaica and, the following year, Cuba. In 1513, Vasco Nunez de Balboa, who dominated a struggling colony in present Colombia, hacked a trail across the Isthmus of Panama and discovered the Pacific Ocean.</p>
