<h2 id=is-there-still-a-planetarium-in-london>Is there still a planetarium in London?</h2>
<p>The building known as the London Planetarium is in Marylebone Road, London. It is adjacent to Madame Tussauds and is owned by the same company. The only planetarium in London is now the Peter Harrison Planetarium in Greenwich, south east London.</p>

<h2 id=what-can-you-see-in-a-planetarium>What can you see in a planetarium?</h2>
<p>A planetarium is a place where you can go to see what the night sky looks like. Planetariums have a large room with a dome-shaped ceiling and many seats. A special projector in this room can shine images on the domed ceiling and show you the stars and other objects in the night sky.</p>
<h2 id=is-greenwich-market-open-during-lockdown>Is Greenwich market open during lockdown?</h2>
<p>Greenwich Market will remain open 7 days a week and so will most of the surrounding cafes and bakeries. After the government enforced restrictions’ announcement to control the spread of Covid-19, we would like to update you what we are doing to ensure your safety whilst visiting the market.</p>
<h2 id=is-greenwich-worth-visiting>Is Greenwich worth visiting?</h2>
<p>Whether you want to experience Regency history or you’re more in the mood to admire the artwork, Greenwich is home to several stunning museums and art collections, all worth a look at. Highlights of free places to visit in London include the Inigo Jones’ designed Queen’s House and the National Maritime Museum.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-the-prime-meridian-for-free>Can you see the prime meridian for free?</h2>
<p>It is a simple golden line on the floor actually and it is made fancier by putting a silver sphere monument on top. Luckily, just outside the fences of the observatory, surrounding the line and the globe monument, the golden meridian line goes on. …</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-see-in-an-observatory>What do you see in an observatory?</h2>
<p>So what can you see at an observatory that you can’t at home? Observatories (and the large telescopes they house) allow us to look at some of the faintest objects in the night sky, and see the brighter objects even clearer. These fainter objects — galaxies and nebulae — are the best reasons to visit an observatory.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-go-round-the-cutty-sark>How long does it take to go round the Cutty Sark?</h2>
<p>I don’t know about the Maritime Museum as I haven’t been but the Observatory and Cutty Sark are both about 2 hours each maximum for a gentle walk round and an entertaining visit.</p>
<h2 id=is-cutty-sark-a-good-whiskey>Is Cutty Sark a good whiskey?</h2>
<p>Cutty Sark is a great value. It’s better than some NAS single malts, it’s better than some pricier blends and can be picked up for 1/2 – 1/3 the price of an average single malt.</p>

<h2 id=is-the-peter-harrison-planetarium-in-greeenwich-free>Is the Peter Harrison Planetarium in greeenwich free?</h2>
<p>Entry is free for members of the Royal Museums Greeenwich who also receive 10% discount in the cafe and shop but the planetarium talks get very busy so tickets need to be booked in advance. The planetarium itself is very comfortable with good sound.</p>
