<h2 id=why-does-loch-ness-freeze-in-the-winter>Why does Loch Ness freeze in the winter?</h2>
<p>Scotland has some brutally cold winters but don’t expect Loch Ness to freeze. Thanks to the thermocline effect, the water is consistently replaced by warmer temperatures of water from the deeper levels of the lake. Oddly enough, if you do a tour of the Highlands in the winter, you may even see steam coming off Loch Ness.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-loch-ness-monster-get-its-name>How did the Loch Ness Monster get its name?</h2>
<p>1) The Loch Ness Monster is known by the nickname “Nessie”. 2) She was first spotted in 565AD by St Columba as he took a swim in Loch Ness. 3) She lives in the Loch Ness lake in the Scottish highlands. 4) Loch Ness is the largest body of fresh water in Britain.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-go-to-loch-ness-every-year>How many people go to Loch Ness every year?</h2>
<p>Since having a long history throughout Scotland, there are a bunch of tours that tourists can take when in the area. From hicking the Highlands to taking a boat down Loch Ness, Scotland sees over one million people every year who only come to see this Loch Ness.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-board-game-called-the-loch-ness-hunt>Is there a board game called the Loch Ness hunt?</h2>
<p>52) There is a board game called The Nessie Hunt. 53) The Loch Ness Monster isn’t the only creature said to inhabit Scottish waters. 54) Scientist Adrian Shine has been looking for Nessie for more than 25 years. 55) Around 1 million people visit Loch Ness each year and create about £25million in the economy.</p>
