<h2 id=does-brazil-follow-common-law>Does Brazil follow common law?</h2>
<p>Brazil adopts a civil law system, based on the Roman-Germanic tradition.</p>
<h2 id=does-brazil-have-strict-laws>Does Brazil have strict laws?</h2>
<p>There are many codified statutes in force in Brazil. The current Federal Constitution, created on October 5, 1988, is the supreme law of the country. The Constitution organizes the country as a Federative Republic formed by the indissoluble union of the states and municipalities and of the Federal District.</p>
<h2 id=is-brazil-civil-law-or-common-law>Is Brazil civil law or common law?</h2>
<p>Brazil’s judiciary system is based on civil law, or statutory law. Unlike common law, the basis of the Brazilian System is codified legislation; however, precedents can influence a decision in court depending on the situation.</p>
<h2 id=is-owning-a-gun-legal-in-brazil>Is owning a gun legal in Brazil?</h2>
<p>In Brazil, all firearms are required to be registered with the minimum age for gun ownership being 25. For citizens to legally own a gun, they must have a gun license, which costs R$88,00 and pay a fee every ten years to renew the gun register. The registration can be done online or in person with the Federal Police.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-carry-a-gun-in-brazil>Can I carry a gun in Brazil?</h2>
<p>It is now much easier to buy and carry firearms in Brazil. Civilians are allowed to keep up to four guns at home or in the workplace. They have access to high-caliber guns that used to be restricted to the military or the police. They can now purchase much more ammunition, too.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-traffic-laws-that-apply-in-brazil>Are there any traffic laws that apply in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Although traffic norms may vary depending on what city or region you are in, you should not expect Brazilian drivers to have the same regard for traffic laws or traffic etiquette as they do in most of the U.S and Europe.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-parents-permission-to-travel-to-brazil>Do you need parent’s permission to travel to Brazil?</h2>
<p>Brazilian law requires any minor who is a Brazilian citizen (even dual nationals who are both U.S. and Brazilian citizens) to have permission from each parent to travel within Brazil or exit the country. When a minor travels with both parents, no written authorization is needed.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-subject-to-new-data-protection-law-in-brazil>Who is subject to new data protection law in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Any foreign company that has at least a branch in Brazil, or offers services to the Brazilian market and collects and treats personal data of data subjects located in the country, regardless of the nationality, will be subject to the new law.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-for-us-citizens-to-travel-to-brazil>Is it safe for US citizens to travel to Brazil?</h2>
<p>Gang activity and organized crime is widespread. Assaults are common. U.S. government personnel are discouraged from using public, municipal buses in all parts of Brazil due to an elevated risk of robbery and assault at any time of day, and especially at night. Read the Safety and Security section on the country information page.</p>
