<h2 id=what-are-the-parts-of-ireland-called>What are the parts of Ireland called?</h2>
<p>Since the early 17th century, there have been four Provinces of Ireland: Connacht, Leinster, Munster, and Ulster. The Irish word for this territorial division, cúige, meaning “fifth part”, indicates that there were once five; however, in the medieval period there were more.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-eire-and-eireann>What’s the difference between Eire and Eireann?</h2>
<p>Difference between Éire and Erin While Éire is simply the name for the island of Ireland in the Irish language, and sometimes used in English, Erin is a common poetic name for Ireland, as in Erin go bragh.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-southern-part-of-ireland-called>What is the southern part of Ireland called?</h2>
<p>As well as “Ireland”, “Éire” or “the Republic of Ireland”, the state is also referred to as “the Republic”, “Southern Ireland” or “the South”. In an Irish republican context it is often referred to as “the Free State” or “the 26 Counties”.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-official-name-of-the-irish-state>Which is the official name of the Irish state?</h2>
<p>Hence, the Irish state has two official names, Éire (in Irish) and Ireland (in English ). For official purposes, including in international treaties and other legal documents, and where the language of the documents is English, the Irish government uses the name Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-most-common-names-in-ireland>What are the most common names in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Surnames today: There are many different origins for Irish names today but the vast majority can be broken down into either of three categories: Gaelic Irish, Cambro-Norman, and finally Anglo-Irish. The Table shown here gives a listing of the 100 most commonly names found in Ireland and their meanings.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-names-of-irish-children-come-from>Where did the names of Irish children come from?</h2>
<p>This is how the Irish (both in Ireland and the first and second generation Irish immigrants to America) named their children for two centuries: 1. The eldest son was named after the child’s paternal grandfather. 2. The second son was named after that child’s maternal grandfather. 3.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-island-to-the-east-of-ireland>Which is the island to the east of Ireland?</h2>
<p>To its east is the island of Great Britain, from which it is separated by the Irish Sea and North Channel. The Irish constitution proclaims that the state´s name is Éire (in the Irish Gaelic language), while the world knows it as Ireland.</p>
