<h2 id=when-and-how-did-andreas-vesalius-die>When and how did Andreas Vesalius die?</h2>
<p>[5]. We also know that he stepped off the ship on the Venetian island of Zante (now Zakynthos in Greece) on October 15, 1564, sick, weak and frail, that he slowly walked towards the gates of the city where he collapsed and fell dead.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-vesalius>What happened to Vesalius?</h2>
<p>Conflicting reports obscure the final days of Vesalius’s life. Apparently he became ill aboard ship while returning to Europe from his pilgrimage. He was put ashore on the Greek island of Zacynthus, where he died.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-andreas-vesalius-dissect-human-bodies>Why did Andreas Vesalius dissect human bodies?</h2>
<p>Clearly he had an eye for comparative anatomy. He observed anatomical variants and studied foetal anatomy. Occasionally, he would dissect a body to study physiological processes, while the post-mortems on the bodies brought in by the families of the deceased gave him an insight into human pathology.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-andreas-vesalius-important>Why was Andreas Vesalius important?</h2>
<p>Andreas Vesalius was a Belgian born anatomist and physician, born in 1514 into a family of physicians. He is considered the father of modern anatomy and his work the beginning of modern medicine.</p>
<h2 id=who-proved-galen-wrong>Who proved Galen wrong?</h2>
<p>Vesalius had proved that some of Galen’s ideas on anatomy were wrong, eg Galen claimed that the lower jaw was made up of two bones, not one. He encouraged others to investigate for themselves and not just accept traditional teachings.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-andreas-vesalius-impact-today>How did Andreas Vesalius impact today?</h2>
<p>Vesalius, considered as the founder of modern anatomy, had profoundly changed not only human anatomy, but also the intellectual structure of medicine. The impact of his scientific revolution can be recognized even today.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-mistakes-did-vesalius-find-in-galens-work>How many mistakes did Vesalius find in Galen’s work?</h2>
<p>Andreas Vesalius was an expert in anatomy: He was the first person to perform human dissections and produce detailed, accurate drawings of the human body. He published his book, On the Fabric of the Human Body, in 1543. He proved Galen wrong in over 200 different ways.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-andreas-vesalius-die-and-where-was-he-buried>When did Andreas Vesalius die and where was he buried?</h2>
<p>Vesalius died on a trip to the Holy Land in 1564. Even today , it’s not known how he died or where he’s buried, which has led to much speculation. Andreas Vesalius was a Flemish doctor who is notable for his contribution to the science of anatomy of the human body.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-andreas-vesalius-so-important-to-medicine>Why was Andreas Vesalius so important to medicine?</h2>
<p>There was debate about where in the body the blood should be taken from. Vesalius’ pamphlet was supported by his knowledge of the blood system and he showed clearly how anatomical dissection could be used to test speculation, and underlined the importance of understanding the structure of the body in medicine.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-andreas-vesalius-do-with-his-woodblocks>What did Andreas Vesalius do with his woodblocks?</h2>
<p>The following year, Vesalius used his woodblocks to illustrate his book De humani corporis fabrica libri septem (“On the fabric of the human body in seven books”). Published in 1543, the textbook contained detailed depictions of the human anatomy and over 270 illustrations.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-andreas-vesalius-leave-paris-for-spain>When did Andreas Vesalius leave Paris for Spain?</h2>
<p>According to Saunders, Vesalius studied the bones until he was able to identify them blindfolded by touch. In 1536, war broke out between France and Spain, and Vesalius left Paris before he could graduate.</p>
