<h2 id=what-is-an-environmental-issue-in-virginia>What is an environmental issue in Virginia?</h2>
<p>The pollution of groundwater, streams and waterways from industries and agriculture continue to be a threat. Salt runoffs from roads, acidic runoff from burning fossil fuels, contaminants washed from petroleum products are some of the nonpoint source pollution issues in Virginia.</p>
<h2 id=in-what-location-in-virginia-has-this-environmental-topic-been-an-issue-problem>In what location in Virginia has this environmental topic been an issue problem?</h2>
<p>— The Chesapeake Bay located in the states of Maryland and Virginia is home to 3,600 species of animal and plant life. The largest estuary in the United States has a very complex ecosystem and unfortunately a variety of environmental issues. Issues ranging from agriculture to climate change to bay grasses dying off.</p>
<h2 id=does-virginia-have-good-land>Does Virginia have good land?</h2>
<p>The fertile soils of Virginia are legendary. Many farmers or agronomists have come to Virginia to enjoy the variety, quality and the quantity of the Virginian soil.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-pollution-problem-in-virginia>What is the biggest pollution problem in Virginia?</h2>
<p>One particularly troublesome threat to Virginia’s lands and waters comes from the nonpoint source pollution of surface waterways and groundwater — that is, the diffuse but pervasive degradation that doesn’t come from the end of a pipe.</p>
<h2 id=how-polluted-is-virginia>How polluted is Virginia?</h2>
<p>Particulate Pollution The current average annual PM2. 5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) is 12 micrograms per cubic meter. Average exposure in Virginia for 2015 was 8.3 micrograms of fine particles per cubic meter — lower than the United States average (9.5) and ranking 20th in the nation.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-trees-dying-in-virginia>Why are trees dying in Virginia?</h2>
<p>Advanced tree age and prolonged periods of drought are also common predisposing factors in Virginia. These factors reduce the tree’s ability to fight off insect and disease pests and make them more susceptible to future disturbances. Inciting factors such as frost, drought, or defoliating insects are more short-term.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-killing-trees-in-virginia>What is killing trees in Virginia?</h2>
<p>Emerald Ash Borer: An exotic invasive insect that kills ash trees, and has been identified in Northern Virginia. Virginia is now under federal quarantine, and it is illegal to move ash logs, ash firewood, or ash nursery stock out of Virginia.</p>
<h2 id=what-virginia-is-known-for>What Virginia is known for?</h2>
<p>Since Virginia was the site of the first permanent English settlement, the state is known as “the birthplace of a nation.” As well as the “Mother of Presidents” Eight Virginia born gentlemen succeeded to the highest office in the land, including four of the first five presidents.</p>
<h2 id=is-virginia-water-polluted>Is Virginia water polluted?</h2>
<p>Industrial facilities dumped over 18 million pounds of toxic chemicals into Virginia’s waterways, the second-most in the nation, according to a new report released today by Environment Virginia. The New River saw the most toxic pollution in the state, with over 12 million pounds dumped into its waters.</p>
<h2 id=is-virginia-water-polluted-1>Is Virginia Water polluted?</h2>
<h2 id=what-are-the-threats-to-land-and-water-in-virginia>What are the threats to land and water in Virginia?</h2>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-important-land-use-in-virginia>Which is the most important land use in Virginia?</h2>
<p>Forests cover 62 percent of the state’s land area making forestry the single most important land use in Virginia. Forests tend to be found on land that is unsuitable for other uses, particularly agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonists-want-to-own-land-in-virginia>Why did the colonists want to own land in Virginia?</h2>
<p>Owning a massive block of land in Virginia generated no profit for the investors unless there were farmers growing tobacco on that land. The Virginia Company needed to increase immigration to Virginia, and to decrease emigration of servants who had completed their time of required service. The company adapted.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-environmental-problems-of-abandoned-farmland>What are the environmental problems of abandoned farmland?</h2>
<p>The derelict conditions of abandoned farmland results in various environmental problems. Neglected agricultural lands are prone to extensive wind erosion, with land literally drying up and blowing away. Air pollution worsens and contributes to respiratory illnesses in humans and livestock.</p>
