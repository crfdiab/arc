<h2 id=did-prisons-exist-in-medieval-times>Did prisons exist in medieval times?</h2>
<p>These medieval prisons were ‘constituents of the urban landscape and proud symbols of a hard-won independence’. They contributed to the achievement of municipal security, legal efficiency, and commercial expediency.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-game-of-d-and-d-called>What is a game of D and D called?</h2>
<p>Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-play-dampd-with-2-players>Can you play D&D with 2 players?</h2>
<p>In addition to a bunch of handy pack-ins and a meaty campaign that takes new players up through sixth level, it also includes rules for two-player games. Now all you need to play D&D is a Dungeon Master, a single player character, and a trusty sidekick.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-medieval-gaols-used-for>What were medieval gaols used for?</h2>
<p>Conditions in these prisons, or gaols, were poor. Houses of correction were used in Tudor times and were sometimes called bridewells. Their aim was to reform persistent beggars, and provide ‘correction’ for unmarried mothers. There were also debtors’ prisons where those in debt remained until their debts were repaid.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-dungeon-like-in-a-medieval-castle>What was the dungeon like in a medieval castle?</h2>
<p>As castles became more luxurious, their dungeons became associated with prison cells and often they were located underground. Technically speaking when people talk about a dungeon what they often mean is an Oubliette. This comes from the French for “to forget”. Basically a prisoner was put in here, forgotten about and left to die.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-a-prisoner-of-war-in-medieval-england>What happens to a prisoner of war in medieval England?</h2>
<p>It could be a costly business – a king who lost good men and spent his wealth fighting would want compensation. The son of the Constable of Richmond Castle had to pay 200 marks after his father’s castle was seized in 1216. Prisoners usually remained in captivity until their relatives could gather the ransom.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-most-terrifying-dungeon-in-england>Where was the most terrifying dungeon in England?</h2>
<p>The most terrifying castle dungeons in the whole of England were undoubtedly those of Pontefract Castle, in Yorkshire. Pontefract Castle was a vast and fearsome fortress with a blood-curdling reputation – it was so notorious that it was depicted in Shakespeare’s play, Richard III.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-dungeon-of-pontefract-castle-used-for>What was the dungeon of Pontefract Castle used for?</h2>
<p>During the English Civil War, the dungeons of the Pontefract Castle began to be used as stores for ammunition and weaponry for use during the conflict. Today, it’s possible to tour the old armour stores, and you’re still able to see the graffiti that the old prisoners scratched into the walls of their prison.</p>
