<p>three years<br>
The basic school system in Japan is composed of elementary school (lasting six years), middle school (three years), high school (three years), and university (four years). Education is compulsory only for the nine years of elementary and middle school, but 98.8% of students go on to high school.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-kids-stay-in-school-in-japan>How long do kids stay in school in Japan?</h2>
<p>School year starts in April and ends in March. For Japanese nationals, six years at elementary school and three years at junior high school (total nine years) are compulsory. Although foreign nationals are not subject to Japanese compulsory education, they may enter local elementary/junior high schools if they wish.</p>

<p>Yōchien (幼稚園, Nursery school) from 3 to 6 years old. Shōgakkō (小学, Elementary school) from 6 to 12. Chūgakkō (中学, Middle School) from 12 to 15. Kōkō (高校, High school) from 15 to 18.</p>

<p>Compulsory education in Japan lasts nine years – up through middle school – but most kids attend high school as well. For the most part English is taught from middle school and on, and many college students take classes in the subject, too.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-middle-school-and-high-school-in-japan>What’s the difference between Middle School and high school in Japan?</h2>
<p>The chuugakkou 中学校 in Japan has no real equivalent in the United States school system. This is because it starts at the same time as “middle school,” however, in the US “middle school” is sometimes called “junior high school” instead. Most notably, the last year of chuugakkou is equivalent to the freshman year (first year) of high school in the US.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-interesting-facts-about-the-japanese-school-system>What are some interesting facts about the Japanese school system?</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting a fact about the Japanese school system is that there is no practice requiring children to repeat a year. Furthermore, it is impossible to fail an exam. It is also worth to note, that compulsory education in Japan is free. Still, the country provides the ability to choose between public and private schools.</p>

<p>Junior High School Grade 6 to 8 (5-3-4) Grade 7 to 8 (6-2-4)</p>
