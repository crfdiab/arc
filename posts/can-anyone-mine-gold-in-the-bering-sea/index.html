<p>There is still gold to be found in the sands along the beach, extending for several miles along the Bering Sea. Miners can also find gold out in the ocean, offshore from Nome. Most operators use huge suction dredges and vacuum up gravels off the floor of the ocean in search of gold.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-are-the-kellys-worth-on-bering-sea-gold>How much are the Kelly’s worth on Bering Sea Gold?</h2>
<p>Both Andy and Kris Kelly have a Net Worth of at least $100,000.00 each.</p>

<p>His ability to stay underwater for hours has gained him recognition, and now ‘Bering Sea Gold’ has become a significant source of income for George. The talented athlete and diver apparently earns about $100,000 from the show every season.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-pan-for-gold-at-the-beach>Can you pan for gold at the beach?</h2>
<p>It simply been diluted by the huge amount of water that makes up an ocean. You can find gold in the ocean, but you’re going to work awfully hard for a very small amount, unless of course you are traveling with extensive, underwater mining equipment.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-do-the-deadliest-catch-cast-get-paid>How much do the Deadliest Catch cast get paid?</h2>
<p>However, crab fishers don’t really get paid a salary, they get paid based on their catch. And since crab fishing is seasonal (three months), it’s not the most steady money. “For crab seasons, deckhands can typically make anywhere from $15,000 to $50,000 for a couple months of work,” Kenny said.</p>

<p>Wiki/Bio Facts</p>
<table><tr><th>Full name</th><th>Shawn Pomrenke</th></tr><tr><td>Place of Birth</td><td>Minnesota, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Gold miner, Reality Television Personality</td></tr><tr><td>Net worth</td><td>$3M</td></tr><tr><td>Wife</td><td>Jeanette Koelsch(ex), Jenny Schield (ex)</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-was-gold-found-in-the-bering-sea>Why was gold found in the Bering Sea?</h2>
<p>Speaking of which, gold dredgers tend to stick close to the coastline because that is where the gold tend to be found. This is because geological processes resulted in gold being deposited inland, which have since been carried out to the sea through the rivers and streams.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-ken-kerr-from-bering-sea-gold-come-from>Where did Ken Kerr from Bering Sea Gold come from?</h2>
<p>Ken Kerr hails from New Mexico and first appeared on ‘Bering Sea Gold’ in the show’s tenth season premiere titled ‘Enter a Titan.’ The episode introduces the strong-headed miner and lifelong treasure hunter along with his massive 120 feet, 600-ton dredge, Myrtle Irene. He is relentless in his pursuit of gold and stops at nothing.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-the-captain-of-the-bering-sea-gold-worth>How much is the captain of the Bering Sea gold worth?</h2>
<p>Steve Pomrenke himself has an estimated net worth of $5 million , the vast majority of which comes from the actual mining work– he’d be doing just fine with or without the show, honestly. Son Shawn, on the other hand, is only worth $2 million. Co-owners or not, there’s no mistaking who the captain is.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-be-found-at-bottom-of-bering-sea>What can be found at bottom of Bering Sea?</h2>
<p>In particular, it is interesting to note that dredges see common use in fishing for both crabs and some species of shellfish that are found at the bottom of the sea. People have been known to emulate what they see on the TV screen, with Bering Sea Gold being no exception to this rule.</p>
