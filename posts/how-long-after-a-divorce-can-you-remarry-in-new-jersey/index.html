<h2 id=how-long-after-a-divorce-can-you-remarry-in-new-jersey>How long after a divorce can you remarry in New Jersey?</h2>
<p>In New Jersey, you are free to remarry at any point after your divorce is final. However, you must be certain your divorce is actually official and final. It is not final until the judgment of divorce is signed by the Judge.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-you-have-to-wait-to-be-remarried>How long do you have to wait to be remarried?</h2>
<p>You must wait 30 days from the date of divorce before you can marry someone else. This 30 day waiting period can be waived by the judge if there is a good reason to do so.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-be-ordained-to-marry-someone-in-north-carolina>Do you have to be ordained to marry someone in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>The state of North Carolina actually says that marriages may be performed by “an ordained minister of any religious denomination, a minister authorized by a church, or a magistrate.” (NCGS 51-1). In other words, ministers must have been ordained by a “brick-and-mortar” church (IRS Publication 1828).</p>
<h2 id=when-to-file-for-divorce-in-north-carolina>When to file for divorce in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>You must live in North Carolina for six months prior to filing for divorce in the state. But more importantly, you and your spouse must have lived separately for at least one year prior to the divorce. It is important to note that these 12 months must be consecutive.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-get-married-after-a-waiting-period>What happens if you get married after a waiting period?</h2>
<p>If you marry during that time period, the marriage is voidable. “Voidable” means that as long as no one contests the new marriage, it will become valid once the waiting period has run. “Void” means the subsequent marriage is invalid because the previous marriage had not yet legally ended.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-bible-say-about-remarriage-after-the-death-of-your-spouse>What does the Bible say about remarriage after the death of your spouse?</h2>
<p>The Apostle Paul allowed widows to remarry in 1 Corinthians 7:8-9 and encouraged younger widows to remarry in 1 Timothy 5:14. Remarriage after the death of a spouse is absolutely allowed by God. What does the Bible say about remarriage after the death of your spouse?</p>
<h2 id=when-is-a-marriage-void-in-rhode-island>When is a marriage void in Rhode Island?</h2>
<p>“Void” means the subsequent marriage is invalid because the previous marriage had not yet legally ended. In Rhode Island, a marriage entered into within three months after a divorce is void.</p>
