<h2 id=what-key-document-revised-the-articles-of-confederation>What key document revised the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>The present United States Constitution<br>
The present United States Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation on March 4, 1789.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-first-to-call-for-a-revision-of-the-articles-of-confederation>Who was first to call for a revision of the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>Attempts to Revise the Articles of Confederation. In Congress, Charles Pinckney proposed a revision of the Articles of Confederation.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-they-revise-articles-of-confederation>Why did they revise Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>After the war Congress and the state governments continued to produce money contributing to what Madison referred to as the “mortal diseases” of the government under the Articles of Confederation and resulting in calls for a new federal constitution to strengthen the national government.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-event-that-led-to-the-revision-of-the-articles-of-confederation>What was the event that led to the revision of the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>The problems caused by a weak national government eventually led to the dismantling of the Articles of Confederation. A citizens’ rebellion in Massachusetts known as Shays’s Rebellion soon led to a Constitutional Convention.</p>
<h2 id=who-revised-the-articles-of-confederation>Who revised the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>In May 1786, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Congress responded by appointing a committee to draft amendments to the Articles. On August 7, 1786, the committee produced these amendments, written chiefly by committee chairman Pinckney.</p>
<h2 id=what-problems-were-created-by-the-articles-of-confederation>What problems were created by the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>With the passage of time, weaknesses in the Articles of Confederation became apparent; Congress commanded little respect and no support from state governments anxious to maintain their power. Congress could not raise funds, regulate trade, or conduct foreign policy without the voluntary agreement of the states.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-congress-revise-the-articles-of-confederation>When did Congress revise the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>Congress came to revise the Articles of Confederation but then change it to a new government, the Constituition. Convention called in 1787 to discuss problems with the current government document, the Articles of Confederation.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-author-of-the-articles-of-confederation>Who was the author of the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>In effect, this document created the structure for the confederation of these newly minted 13 states. After many attempts by several delegates to the Continental Congress, a draft by John Dickinson of Pennsylvania was the basis for the final document, which was adopted in 1777.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-articles-of-confederation-solve-problems>How did the Articles of Confederation solve problems?</h2>
<p>Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress was incredibly powerful and could settle disputes between states and solve territorial issues by passing legislation like the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Even with those strengths though, the federal government wasn’t strong enough to solve the problems of the new nation.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-guiding-principle-of-the-articles-of-confederation>What was the guiding principle of the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states. The weak central government established by the Articles received only those powers which the former colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament.</p>
