<h2 id=is-shinty-irish-or-scottish>Is shinty Irish or Scottish?</h2>
<p>Shinty, which is a Scottish game very similar to hurling, has had long links with its Irish counterpart. The GAA and the Camanachd Association (shinty’s ruling body in Scotland) have had contact going back to 1897. Meaningful compromise shinty/hurling rules games between Ireland and Scotland started in 1972.</p>

<p>Origins. Hurling, an Irish pastime for at least 2,000 years similar to shinty, is derived from the historic game common to both peoples. Shinty/Hurling appears prominently in the legend of Cúchulainn, the Celtic mythology hero. A similar game is played on the Isle of Man known as cammag, a name cognate with camanachd.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-scottish-invent-field-hockey>Did the Scottish invent field hockey?</h2>
<p>Hockey is similar to an ancient game played in Scotland called shinty. Hockey is often played at schools in the UK but its origins are unclear. Later came ice hockey, which developed in Canada.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-shinty-called-in-ireland>What is shinty called in Ireland?</h2>
<p>shinny<br>
Shinty, also called shinny, or shinney, Gaelic camanachd, game played outdoors with sticks and a small, hard ball in which two opposing teams attempt to hit the ball through their opponents’ goal (hail); it is similar to the Irish game of hurling and to field hockey.</p>
<h2 id=how-dangerous-is-shinty>How dangerous is shinty?</h2>
<p>Shinty does have a reputation for being a dangerous/violent sport; however, more serious long-term injuries occur while playing football and rugby.</p>

<p>three seasons<br>

<h2 id=why-was-hurling-banned>Why was hurling banned?</h2>
<p>It was also a punishable crime under the Brehon Laws to deliberately strike another with a hurley. There are many references to the game of hurling in the centuries before the birth of Christ. There is evidence that hurling was an essential part of life for young men preparing to be warriors.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-oldest-field-game-in-the-world>What is the oldest field game in the world?</h2>
<p>Hurling<br>
Hurling is one of the oldest field games in the world and is popular for at least 3000 years in Ireland with the first literary reference dating back to 1272 BC.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-game-of-shinty-come-from>Where did the game of shinty come from?</h2>
<p>Shinty – or camanachd as it is traditionally known in the Gaelic-speaking West Highlands – is an ancient game.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-term-shinty-on-ice-come-from>Where did the term shinty on ice come from?</h2>
<p>The picture was believed to show a winter scene in December 1796. The book On the Origin of Hockey references happenings in 1803 in Paisley in Scotland. Two teenage boys were playing an early version of it dubbed shinty on ice, and drowned after the ice caved in.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-shinty-become-a-sport-in-scotland>How did shinty become a sport in Scotland?</h2>
<p>Introduced to North-West Scotland along with Christianity and the Gaelic language nearly two thousand years ago by Irish missionaries (St Columba is said to have arrived on these shores as a result of some shenanigans at an Irish hurling match), the game can safely lay claim to being Scotland’s national sport.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-find-shinty-in-the-world>Where can you find shinty in the world?</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that shinty was popular at various stages virtually nation-wide. It is to be found from the wind-swept rocks of St Kilda to the more hospitable and gentler plains of the Borders.</p>
