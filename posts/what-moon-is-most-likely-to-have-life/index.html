<h2 id=what-moon-is-most-likely-to-have-life>What moon is most likely to have life?</h2>
<p>The strongest candidates for natural satellite habitability are currently icy satellites such as those of Jupiter and Saturn—Europa and Enceladus respectively, although if life exists in either place, it would probably be confined to subsurface habitats.</p>
<h2 id=what-life-on-moon-would-be-like>What life on moon would be like?</h2>
<p>The reality of life on the Moon Each person eats roughly 1,095 to 1,825 pounds of food every year, but we would need even more to maintain a healthy diet on the Moon. It’s also near impossible to grow food in the Moon’s atmosphere, though scientists are devising ways around this.</p>
<h2 id=is-life-on-jupiter>Is life on Jupiter?</h2>
<p>While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported.</p>
<h2 id=can-jupiter-ever-support-life>Can Jupiter ever support life?</h2>
<p>Ingredients for Life? Jupiter cannot support life as we know it. But some of Jupiter’s moons have oceans beneath their crusts that might support life.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-find-out-what-my-moon-sign-is>How can I find out what my Moon sign is?</h2>
<p>Look up your Moon sign. If you are unsure of your Moon sign, you can determine it by entering your data in the Moon Sign Calculator below: Every 2 to 2-1/2 days, the Moon changes signs.

<p>The scientist added the source of the organics could be comets or meteorites which have deposited the matter on the Moon’s surface but the recent discovery by another impact probe — the LCROSS mission — of ice in the polar regions of the Moon also “lend credence to the possibility of organic matter there.”</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-living-things-on-the-moon>Are there any living things on the Moon?</h2>
<p>Our technological advancements mean that we may someday be able to colonize the moon, although recent decades have seen our attention shift to the possibility of establishing a colony on Mars. The only life that could survive on the moon (or anywhere else in the vacuum of empty space) is the tardigrade. Also known as the water bear, this …</p>
