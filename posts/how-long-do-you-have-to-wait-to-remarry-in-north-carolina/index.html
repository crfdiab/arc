<h2 id=how-long-after-being-widowed-can-you-remarry-legally>How long after being widowed can you remarry legally?</h2>
<p>The widow or widower needs to be emotionally ready. An emotionally needy person will expect too much from their partner. With this understanding in mind, remarrying should happen when the person is healed and emotionally ready. In my opinion, a widow or widower should wait for a minimum of two years before remarrying.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-date-while-separated-in-nc>Can you date while separated in NC?</h2>
<p>1) You Can Date While Separated After you have legally separated you are free to date as if you are not married. Your spouse does not have a say in whether or who you date.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-waiting-period-for-divorce-in-north-carolina>Is there a waiting period for divorce in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Waiting period refers to the time period between the commencement of the divorce proceedings (or filing of divorce papers in court) and the court decree granting the final divorce. This waiting period in North Carolina divorce is a minimum 30 days for a simple uncontested divorce.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-requirements-for-marriage-in-north-carolina>What are the requirements for marriage in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>The following table highlights the main provisions of North Carolina’s marriage license requirements. See Marriage License Requirements By State, Marriage Laws Overview, Prenuptial Agreements, Tips for Marriage, and Marriage FAQs for more information.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-restrictions-on-remarriage-after-divorce>Are there any restrictions on remarriage after divorce?</h2>
<p>While there are only a few potential legal restrictions regarding your remarriage, they do exist, and your lawyer can help you identify them. Some divorces have decrees that affect remarriage, so if your new fiancé is also divorced, you need to explore those legal issues.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-waiting-period-to-get-married-after-a-divorce>Is there a waiting period to get married after a divorce?</h2>
<p>Most states no longer have a waiting period before you can get married again after a divorce, but not so long ago divorced people would have to wait up to a year in some states before they could remarry. As late as the 60s and 70s, Arizona (1966), California (1965), Delaware (1949) and Iowa (1976) required a one-year waiting period.</p>
