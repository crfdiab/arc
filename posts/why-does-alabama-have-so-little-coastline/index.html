<h2 id=why-does-alabama-have-so-little-coastline>Why does Alabama have so little coastline?</h2>
<p>Alabama and Mississippi were carved out of land that was once a part of the state of Georgia. The land was split evenly to make the territories of Mississippi and Alabama of equal size to Georgia. At this point, both Alabama and Mississippi were landlocked, with no coastal shoreline.</p>

<p>New Hampshire’s<br>
It’s more complicated than you realize. It’s summer, which means you have probably spent some time on New Hampshire’s 18.57 miles of seashore, the shortest ocean coastline of any state.</p>

<p>the state<br>
Common Law and Statutes Land below the mean high tide line, including the wet beach, is owned by the state and held in trust for the public under the public trust doctrine. The right to own property and exclude others from it is a fundamental feature of U.S. law.</p>

<p>The Spanish officer in charge made no attempt to resist, and so this land became U.S. soil. It was divided, giving basically equal parts to Mississippi and Alabama, thus providing approximately 60 miles of coastal land for both.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-states-have-coastlines-along-the-atlantic-ocean>How many states have coastlines along the Atlantic Ocean?</h2>
<p>There are more than 15 states in the United States with coastlines exceeding 1,000 miles. 30 US states have coastlines with 23 having a coastline on the Atlantic, Arctic, and/or Pacific Ocean. 8 states have shoreline along the Great Lakes. New York is unique in having a coastline along the Atlantic and a shoreline on the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>For example, spring break has us thinking about travel, oftentimes to places south, which led us to the topic of the Alabama coastline and Florida Panhandle. Have you ever wondered why Alabama has only 60 miles of coastline, while Florida enjoys this big stretch of beaches, known as the panhandle, as part of its 1,000+ miles of coastline?</p>
