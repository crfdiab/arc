<h2 id=why-didnt-spain-annex-portugal>Why didn’t Spain annex Portugal?</h2>
<p>Cause they are two different countries, with different cultures, different although similar languages, and a very long history of animosity among both lands, mainly due to the fact that Spain had been trying to annex Portugal for hundreds of years and failed every time (except that part where we didn’t have a king, so …</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-ruler-of-portugal-in-the-5th-century>Who was the ruler of Portugal in the 5th century?</h2>
<p>Germanic tribes (that the Romans referred to as Barbarians) controlled the territory between the 5th and 8th centuries. These included the Kingdom of the Suebi centred in Braga and the Visigothic Kingdom in the south. Eventually the Visigoths seized power in the whole of Iberia.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-portuguese-control-the-sea-trade>Where did the Portuguese control the sea trade?</h2>

<h2 id=when-did-philip-ii-of-spain-take-over-portugal>When did Philip II of Spain take over Portugal?</h2>
