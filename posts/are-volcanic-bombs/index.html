<h2 id=are-volcanic-bombs>Are volcanic bombs?</h2>
<p>A volcanic bomb is a mass of molten rock (tephra) larger than 64 mm (2.5 inches) in diameter, formed when a volcano ejects viscous fragments of lava during an eruption. They cool into solid fragments before they reach the ground.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-volcano-has-bombs>What type of volcano has bombs?</h2>
<p>Some of the Earth’s grandest mountains are composite volcanoes–sometimes called stratovolcanoes. They are typically steep-sided, symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-set-off-a-volcano-with-a-bomb>Can you set off a volcano with a bomb?</h2>
<p>If you dropped a nuclear bomb into the crater of an extinct volcano, you would flatten the mountain out a bit but you wouldn’t set the volcano off because there wouldn’t be any pre-existing upwelling of magma.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-lava-bombs-called>What are lava bombs called?</h2>
<p>Volcanic bomb is pyroclastic rock that is a cooling of a mass of lava it flies thorough the air after eruption. If it is to be called a bomb, a specimens must be larger than 2, 5 inch diameter. Smaller specimens are known as Lapilli.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-can-lava-bombs-travel>How far can lava bombs travel?</h2>
<p>Volcanic bombs are heavy and often fly at high speed. It obviously makes them very hazardous to people around the active vents. However, bombs do not travel very far. The most violent Vulcanian-type eruptions have produced ejection velocities 200-400 m/s which have thrown bombs almost 5 km from the vent3.</p>
<h2 id=what-if-we-put-a-nuke-inside-yellowstone-volcano>What if we put a nuke inside Yellowstone volcano?</h2>
<p>In a nuclear attack, the detonation would occur above ground, so the majority of the energy would be released into the air. So in conclusion, nothing would happen and Yellowstone would not erupt if for some reason a nuclear bomb was detonated near the supervolcano.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-does-a-volcano-have-to-be-to-be-a-volcanic-bomb>How big does a volcano have to be to be a volcanic bomb?</h2>
<p>Volcanic Bombs. Some of it comes out as lava, hot ash, gasses, pyroclastic flows, and even chunks of rock that rain down around the volcano. Any chunk of rock spewed out of a volcano that’s larger than 65 mm in diameter (2.5 inches) is considered to be a volcanic bomb, or lava bomb.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-examples-of-bombing-a-volcano>Are there any examples of bombing a volcano?</h2>
<p>I poked around have found only a very few examples of bombing a volcanic eruption and the United States was involved in every one – at least three times in Hawai`i and once in Italy at Etna. The former was bombing with live ordnance – bombs – while the Etna example was “bombing” with concrete blocks.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-have-been-killed-by-volcanic-bombs>How many people have been killed by volcanic bombs?</h2>
<p>Volcanic bomb. Volcanic bombs are a significant volcanic hazard, and can cause severe injuries and death to people in an eruption zone. One such incident occurred at Galeras volcano in Colombia in 1993; six people near the summit were killed and several seriously injured by lava bombs when the volcano erupted unexpectedly.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-want-to-bomb-a-volcano>Why do people want to bomb a volcano?</h2>
<p>There has been some discussion over the years here on Eruptions about what might happen if you were to bomb an eruption volcano. Now, this might be to divert a lava flow, to stop an eruption to prevent an eruption from occurring, but overall, people seem to love the idea that shear human force could prevent a volcanic disaster.</p>
