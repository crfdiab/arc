<h2 id=who-were-the-first-indians-in-new-york>Who were the first Indians in New York?</h2>
<p>When the first French explorers came to the North Eastern forests of North America five hundred years ago they encountered a people who they called the Iroquois. They ruled a vast territory of what is now New York State.</p>
<h2 id=what-native-americans-settled-in-nyc>What Native Americans settled in NYC?</h2>
<p>There are many famous Native American tribes who played a part in the history of the state and whose tribal territories and homelands are located in the present day state of New York. The names of the New York tribes included the Delaware, Erie, Iroquois, Mohawk, Oneida and Seneca.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-native-to-america-first>Who was native to America first?</h2>
<p>For decades archaeologists thought the first Americans were the Clovis people, who were said to have reached the New World some 13,000 years ago from northern Asia. But fresh archaeological finds have established that humans reached the Americas thousands of years before that.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-someone-a-native-new-yorker>What makes someone a native New Yorker?</h2>
<p>Native New Yorker may refer to: A person who was born in or spent their formative years in New York City. Native New Yorker (film)</p>
<h2 id=how-are-native-americans-represented-in-new-york>How are Native Americans represented in New York?</h2>
<p>The artistry of Native People of New York—represented in the Contemporary Native American Art Collection—celebrates living cultures deeply rooted in tradition. Expressions of adaptation, innovation, community, and belief are represented in a rich variety of forms that help tell the story of Native People today.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-people-in-the-americas-come-from>Where did the first people in the Americas come from?</h2>
<p>They probably came on foot from Siberia across the Bering Land Bridge, which existed between Alaska and Eurasia from the end of the last Ice Age until about 10,000 years ago. The area is now submerged by water.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-discover-america>Who was the first person to discover America?</h2>
<p>Many thousands of years before Christopher Columbus’ ships landed in the Bahamas, a different group of people discovered America: the nomadic ancestors of modern Native Americans who hiked over a “land bridge” from Asia to what is now Alaska more than 12,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-first-people-in-the-new-world>Who are the first people in the New World?</h2>
<p>Europeans arriving in the New World met people all the way from the frozen north to the frozen south. All had rich and mature cultures and established languages. The Skraeling were probably a people we now call Thule, who were the ancestors of the Inuit in Greenland and Canada and the Iñupiat in Alaska.</p>
