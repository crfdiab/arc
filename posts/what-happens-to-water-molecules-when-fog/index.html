<h2 id=what-happens-to-water-molecules-when-fog>What happens to water molecules when fog?</h2>
<p>Fog shows up when water vapor, or water in its gaseous form, condenses. During condensation, molecules of water vapor combine to make tiny liquid water droplets that hang in the air. You can see fog because of these tiny water droplets.</p>
<h2 id=do-water-molecules-absorb-or-release-energy>Do water molecules absorb or release energy?</h2>
<p>During the processes of condensation, freezing, and deposition, water releases energy. The energy released allows the water molecules to change their bonding pattern and transform to a lower energy state. In the Earth system, this energy must be absorbed by the surrounding environment.</p>
<h2 id=in-which-process-does-water-absorb-energy>In which process does water absorb energy?</h2>
<p>evaporation<br>
Latent heating of Earth’s atmosphere occurs as energy, primarily from the sun, causes liquid water to transform to another phase. As this occurs, liquid water absorbs energy, causing it to evaporate and form water vapor. The process of evaporation absorbs tremendous amounts of incoming solar energy.</p>
<h2 id=is-energy-absorb-or-release-during-precipitation>Is energy absorb or release during precipitation?</h2>
<h2 id=what-is-the-disadvantage-of-evaporation>What is the disadvantage of evaporation?</h2>
<p>The main disadvantages of evaporation are high capital, energy and maintenance costs; large size of apparatus; enhanced temperatures; corrosion problems; and scaling or foaming.</p>
<h2 id=does-rain-release-energy>Does rain release energy?</h2>
<p>When it comes to dissipating energy in the atmosphere, the humble raindrop punches way above its weight. Researchers in the US have shown that the energy lost as heat by falling liquid water and ice particles is on par with the energy that the wind loses to friction.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-scariest-dog>What is the scariest dog?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rottweiler. The Rottweiler can keep almost any intruder away.</li>
<li>Doberman Pinscher. Dobermans are well known as working dogs and are well known for their scary looks.</li>
<li>American Bully.</li>
<li>Caucasian Ovcharka.</li>
<li>Great Dane.</li>
<li>German Shepherd.</li>
<li>Belgian Malinois.</li>
<li>Newfoundland.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-does-water-absorb-more-energy-than-other-substances>Why does water absorb more energy than other substances?</h2>
<p>The hydrogen bonds in water allow it to absorb and release heat energy more slowly than many other substances. Temperature is a measure of the motion (kinetic energy) of molecules. As the motion increases, energy is higher and thus temperature is higher. Water absorbs a great deal of energy before its temperature rises.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-temperature-affect-the-motion-of-water-molecules>How does temperature affect the motion of water molecules?</h2>
<p>Temperature is a measure of the motion (kinetic energy) of molecules. As the motion increases, energy is higher and thus temperature is higher. Water absorbs a great deal of energy before its temperature rises. Increased energy disrupts the hydrogen bonds between water molecules.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-bonds-between-water-molecules>What happens to the bonds between water molecules?</h2>
<p>Increased energy disrupts the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Because these bonds can be created and disrupted rapidly, water absorbs an increase in energy and temperature changes only minimally. This means that water moderates temperature changes within organisms and in their environments.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-heat-energy-when-water-evaporates>What happens to heat energy when water evaporates?</h2>
<p>Heat energy that is absorbed when water evaporates is released when the hydrogen bonds form once again and the water vapor condenses into liquid. Water vapor condenses when it (or the air containing it) becomes satu-</p>
