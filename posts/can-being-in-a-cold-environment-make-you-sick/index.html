<h2 id=can-being-in-a-cold-environment-make-you-sick>Can being in a cold environment make you sick?</h2>
<p>While the weather is not directly responsible for making people sick, the viruses that cause colds may spread more easily in lower temperatures, and exposure to cold and dry air may adversely impact the body’s immune system.</p>
<h2 id=can-temperature-changes-cause-you-to-get-sick>Can temperature changes cause you to get sick?</h2>
<p>Most people would agree, sudden weather changes can make you feel under the weather. It can’t actually make you sick, you need to be exposed to the actual bacteria or viruses. But it can weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to those germs.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-catch-a-cold-from-going-hot-to-cold>Can you catch a cold from going hot to cold?</h2>
<p>Heating Up Heading in the other direction—from the deep freeze to the steamy outside—doesn’t pose the same cold risk, says Prof. Eccles, since even more blood circulates to the skin, nose and throat. “It’s a lot like when your car radiator goes on when it gets too hot, to cool off,” he says.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-bad-to-go-from-cold-to-hot-water>Is it bad to go from cold to hot water?</h2>
<p>Experts say that a sudden drop in temperature from hot to cold can be harmful to the human body and especially for people who have chronic cold-related problems. This sudden change in temperature can dry your skin, the mucus membrane and eyes.</p>
<h2 id=what-illnesses-are-caused-by-cold-weather>What illnesses are caused by cold weather?</h2>
<p>Types of Cold-related Illnesses</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hypothermia. When exposed to cold temperatures, your body begins to lose heat faster than it can be produced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frostbite. Frostbite is an injury to the body that is caused by freezing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trench Foot.</p>

<h2 id=how-get-rid-cold-fast>How get rid cold fast?</h2>
<p>To help you get better more quickly:</p>
<ol>
<li>rest and sleep.</li>
<li>keep warm.</li>
<li>drink plenty of water (fruit juice or squash mixed with water is OK) to avoid dehydration.</li>
<li>gargle salt water to soothe a sore throat (not suitable for children)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=why-do-i-feel-cold-when-its-75-degrees>Why do I feel cold when it’s 75 degrees?</h2>
<p>Depending on everything from the size and efficiency of the house to the temperature and humidity outside, that air can sometimes be significantly cooler. “In the winter time, it’s kinda like the opposite,” said Mastropieri. So, that same 75 degrees is being maintained by a steady stream of air that is warmer.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-that-cold-weather-makes-you-sick>Is it true that cold weather makes you sick?</h2>
<p>It has also been proposed that cold weather may dry out the inside lining of your nose, making it more susceptible to penetration by a virus. Evidence Against the Health Claim. It is clear that viruses and bacteria, not cold or wet weather, cause infections.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-get-a-cold-from-cold-weather>When do you get a cold from cold weather?</h2>
<p>Being exposed to cold, wet weather, in and of itself, will not cause you to contract infections. But your chance of developing a cold or the flu does increase in the winter months (beginning in September and lasting until March or April in the US).</p>
<h2 id=is-it-bad-to-change-from-hot-to-cold>Is it bad to change from hot to cold?</h2>
<p>Sudden change from hot to cold can harm health Doctors say that a sudden drop in temperature from hot to cold can produce ill effects in the human body.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-cold-weather-bad-for-your-heart>Why is cold weather bad for Your Heart?</h2>
<p>Winter itself is a poor time for heart problems, because cold weather narrows blood vessels and restricts blood flow. (There’s a reason why doctors tend to recommend that heart-vulnerable patients don’t shovel snow or do vigorous activities outside in freezing weather.)</p>
