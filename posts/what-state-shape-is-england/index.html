<h2 id=what-state-shape-is-england>What state shape is England?</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom is a fragmented state due to the fact that N. Ireland is a separate and distinct country unconnected to the main island.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-england-shaped-like>What is England shaped like?</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom, also called the U.K., consists of a group of islands off the northwest coast of Europe. Much of the north and west of the U.K. is covered in high ground, knife-edged mountain ridges separated by deep valleys. This terrain was shaped in the last Ice Age, when thick glaciers covered the land.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-shape-of-the-land-in-england>What is the shape of the land in England?</h2>
<p>England’s terrain is chiefly low hills and plains, especially in central and southern England. However, there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north (for example, the Lake District and Pennines) and in the west (for example, Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills).</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-england-a-country>What makes England a country?</h2>
<p>Just like Wales and Scotland, England is commonly referred to as a country but it is not a sovereign state. It is the largest country within the United Kingdom both by landmass and population, has taken a pivitol role in the creation of the UK, and its capital London also happens to be the capital of the UK.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-country-is-the-united-kingdom>What kind of country is the United Kingdom?</h2>

<h2 id=where-is-england-located-in-relation-to-great-britain>Where is England located in relation to Great Britain?</h2>
<p>England is located in the southern part of the island of Great Britain, which is part of the country of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom includes the administrative regions of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Each region varies in its level of autonomy, but they are all part of the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-united-kingdom-surrounded-by-land-or-sea>Is the United Kingdom surrounded by land or sea?</h2>
<p>Julie Fryer/Bruce Coleman Ltd. Apart from the land border with the Irish republic, the United Kingdom is surrounded by sea. To the south of England and between the United Kingdom and France is the English Channel. The North Sea lies to the east.</p>
