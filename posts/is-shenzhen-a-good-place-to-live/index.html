<h2 id=is-shenzhen-a-good-place-to-live>Is Shenzhen A good place to live?</h2>
<p>Shenzhen is a decent place to live, it’s quite clean, public services are decent, and it’s relatively inexpensive. There is a large community of expats, so you can easily find foreigner friends, but it might be hard to meet locals due to the language barrier.</p>
<h2 id=whats-good-about-shenzhen>What’s good about Shenzhen?</h2>
<p>It is best known for shopping and entertainment, thanks to its large malls and many family-friendly amusement parks. Nearly 50 years ago, Shenzhen was little more than a fishing village, but have evolved into a city of more than 8 million people and is rapidly expanding to become a top retail destination.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-people-moving-to-shenzhen>Why are people moving to Shenzhen?</h2>
<p>The main push factor in Shenzhen would be raising a family. Though Shenzhen has many schools of all kinds, if a family was living in Shenzhen permanently, they might move out to raise their family in a more quiet and less built up place then Shenzhen. Also, most local people in Shenzhen do not speak English.</p>
<h2 id=is-shenzhen-expensive-to-live-in>Is Shenzhen expensive to live in?</h2>
<p>Shenzhen is China’s coolest, cleanest and most livable city. In 2019, Lonely Planet ranked Shenzhen as second in the world in the list of top 10 cities to visit. Shenzhen has a slightly higher cost of living than most cities in China but it is cheaper than 67% of cities in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-good-salary-in-shenzhen>What is a good salary in Shenzhen?</h2>
<p>A person working in Shenzhen typically earns around 29,000 CNY per month. Salaries range from 7,330 CNY (lowest average) to 129,000 CNY (highest average, actual maximum salary is higher). This is the average monthly salary including housing, transport, and other benefits.</p>
<h2 id=does-it-snow-in-shenzhen>Does it snow in Shenzhen?</h2>
<p>Fun fact: there is no real snow in Shenzhen. Like in Hong Kong, Macau, and other places along the Pearl River Delta, winter there is usually mild, short, and ice-free.</p>
<h2 id=is-shenzhen-worth-visiting>Is Shenzhen worth visiting?</h2>
<p>Yes, Shenzhen is worth traveling to as a tourist since it has lots of nice and interesting places like window of the world, minghua seaworld, chinese village, zoo, etc. each of these is humongous in size, and takes 1–2 days just to see! seaworld also has a real nice musical fountain show each evening.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-shenzhen-so-important>Why is Shenzhen so important?</h2>
<p>In 1979 it became one of China’s first Special Economic Zones and began attracting increasing numbers of people in search of employment, leading to overpopulation. Despite the high population, Shenzhen is a garden city. It was the first Chinese city to be awarded the Nations in Bloom title in 2000.</p>
<h2 id=is-shenzhen-modern>Is Shenzhen Modern?</h2>
<p>Even though it’s only existed three decades, modern Shenzhen already has a futuristic, seven-storey industrial museum to catalogue its innovations in everything from the internet to new energy, communications to security systems. “Shenzhen is a city that loves reading,” they say.</p>
<h2 id=do-they-speak-english-in-shenzhen>Do they speak English in Shenzhen?</h2>
<p>Many of the people in the markets will speak enough English to barter and sell. Basically in the city center, you can survive with English. Most signs are in English & Mandarin.</p>
<h2 id=is-shenzhen-safe-at-night>Is Shenzhen safe at night?</h2>
<p>WOMEN TRAVELERS RISK : LOW Even though China is an extremely safe country in terms of female safety, solo women are advised to avoid walking alone at night and remain cautious in crowded places.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-thing-about-living-in-shenzhen>What’s the best thing about living in Shenzhen?</h2>
<p>Everyone uses Wechat in Shenzhen. It probably helps that the Wechat headquarters is also in Shenzhen. WeChat makes life in China very convenient and that can really spoil a person. Number five on my list of things I will miss about my life in Shenzhen China are the babies and the grandparents.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-to-live-in-shenzhen-or-hong-kong>Which is better to live in Shenzhen or Hong Kong?</h2>
<p>Space: Shenzhen has a lot more green space a lot more public space, and is generally, in my opinion, a higher quality of life city. Potentially, opportunities/job market. There are definitely more big, western companies in Hong Kong, however the Hong Kong job market is highly competitive.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-shenzhen-the-fastest-growing-city-in-china>Why is Shenzhen the fastest growing city in China?</h2>
<p>Shenzhen may be a newer city, having only received that status just 40 years ago, in 1979, but it is a large city and one of the fastest growing in the world. Due to a large influx of foreign investment, as well as being named a global tech hub, Shenzhen’s economy has become very vibrant.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-of-living-in-china>What are the advantages of living in China?</h2>
<p>Transportation in China is amazing. It allows you to easily travel from one city to another in record time. The railways have more than one hundred twenty-four kilometers of tracks and twenty-two thousand of those kilometers are for high-speed railways.</p>
