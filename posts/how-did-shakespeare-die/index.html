<p>Fever<br>
William Shakespeare/Cause of death<br>
We don’t know the cause of Shakespeare’s death, but there is a theory that Shakespeare died after contracting a fever following a drinking binge with fellow playwrights Ben Jonson and Michael Drayton.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-william-shakespeare-die-and-how>When did William Shakespeare die and how?</h2>
<p>Tradition holds that Shakespeare died on his 52nd birthday, April 23, 1616, but some scholars believe this is a myth. Church records show he was interred at Trinity Church on April 25, 1616. The exact cause of Shakespeare’s death is unknown, though many believe he died following a brief illness.</p>
<h2 id=what-event-did-shakespeare-die-on>What event did Shakespeare die on?</h2>
<p>On St George’s Day 1616, as Shakespeare lay dying in far-off Warwickshire, King James – seemingly untroubled by prior knowledge of this event – was entertained in London by a poet of a rather different order named William Fennor.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-shakespeare-during-the-lost-years>What happened to Shakespeare during the lost years?</h2>
<p>‘The Lost Years’ refers to the period of Shakespeare’s life between the baptism of his twins, Hamnet and Judith in 1585 and his apparent arrival on the London theatre scene in 1592. By oral tradition, it was reported that Shakespeare poached deer from Sir Thomas Lucy’s estate, the nearby Charlecote Park.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-shakespeare-go-for-7-years>Where did Shakespeare go for 7 years?</h2>
<p>London<br>
Seven years later, he was living in London as resident playwright and part owner of a theater company. Nobody knows just what Shakespeare was doing for all those years in between. In fact, the first attempt at any kind of coherent biography wasn’t until 1709, nearly a century after Shakespeare had died.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-was-shakespeares-lost-years>How long was Shakespeare’s lost years?</h2>
<p>We know very little about Shakespeare’s life during two major spans of time, commonly referred to as the “lost years”: 1578-82 and 1585-92. The first period covers the time after Shakespeare left grammar school, until his marriage to Anne Hathaway in November of 1582.</p>
<h2 id=who-said-thus-with-a-kiss-i-die>WHO SAID Thus with a kiss I die?</h2>
<p>William Shakespeare<br>
Quote by William Shakespeare: “thus with a kiss I die”</p>
<h2 id=did-william-shakespeare-disappear-for-7-years>Did William Shakespeare disappear for 7 years?</h2>
<p>Yet we know very little about Shakespeare as a person. One of the biggest mysteries about William Shakespeare, however, is that he completely disappears for more than seven years. When he was 21 years old, Shakespeare was married with three children and living in the small town of Stratford in England.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-when-william-shakespeare-died>What happened when William Shakespeare died?</h2>
<p>William Shakespeare, often regarded as the greatest playwright of all time, is said to have died on April 23, 1616, which is believed to have been his 52nd birthday. The date of his death isn’t certain; the only known end-of-life documentation is a record of his burial two days later.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-historical-events-that-happened-during-shakespeares-time>What are some historical events that happened during Shakespeare’s time?</h2>
