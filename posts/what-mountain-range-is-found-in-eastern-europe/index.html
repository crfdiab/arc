<p>The Carpathian Mountains or Carpathians (/kɑːrˈpeɪθiənz/) are a range of mountains forming an arc across Central and Eastern Europe. Roughly 1,500 km (932 mi) long, it is the third-longest European mountain range after the Urals at 2,500 km (1,553 mi) and the Scandinavian Mountains at 1,700 km (1,056 mi).</p>

<p>Several of Europe’s mountain ranges are highlighted below. The Pyrenees Mountains are a mountain range in Southwest Europe that form a natural boundary between Spain and France.

<p>The river also separates them from the Balkan Mountains at Orşova in Romania. The valley of the March and Oder separates the Carpathians from the Silesian and Moravian chains, which belong to the middle wing of the great Central Mountain System of Europe.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-highest-mountain-range-in-russia>Which is the highest mountain range in Russia?</h2>
