<h2 id=can-i-make-jell-o-pudding-with-water>Can I make Jell-O pudding with water?</h2>
<p>Yes, pudding can be made with water instead of mil, but you will have to reduce the amount of liquid. The protein and fats in milk help the pudding set and become creamy, while the water provides nothing like that. You need to use less water than milk, because the pudding will become too runny.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-in-jello-gelatin>What is in Jello gelatin?</h2>
<p>The primary ingredient in jello is gelatin. Gelatin is made from animal collagen — a protein that makes up connective tissues, such as skin, tendons, ligaments, and bones. The hooves of these animals are primarily made up of keratin — a protein that can’t be made into gelatin.</p>
