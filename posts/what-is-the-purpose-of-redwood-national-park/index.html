<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-redwood-national-park>What is the purpose of Redwood National Park?</h2>
<p>In addition to the redwood forests, the parks preserve other indigenous flora, fauna, grassland prairie, cultural resources, portions of rivers and other streams, and 37 miles (60 km) of pristine coastline. In 1850, old-growth redwood forest covered more than 2,000,000 acres (8,100 km2) of the California coast.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-redwood-national-park-unique>What makes Redwood National Park unique?</h2>
<p>It is home to the tallest trees in the world, called coast redwoods. Redwood National Park was established in 1968, at a time when redwood population had decreased by 90%. Together the four parks make up Redwood National and State Parks, which was established in 1994 to help combine efforts to save the redwood forests.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-redwood>Who discovered redwood?</h2>
<p>Hale D. Tharp<br>
It was discovered by Hale D. Tharp in 1858. For two years previously he had used the meadows in the Giant Forest region as grazing land for his cattle. Shortly after its discovery, John Muir, the great lover of the out-of-doors, visited the grove with Tharp, explored it, and named it “Giant Forest.”</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-redwood>Why is it called redwood?</h2>
<p>The species of Sequoia which grows along the coast has been variously named. The Spanish Californians called it “palo colorado,” which means “red tree.” After Menzies first saw it in 1792, it became known as Redwood, because of its beautifully colored pink or reddish heart wood.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-redwood-national-park-is-famous-for>What is the Redwood National Park is famous for?</h2>
<p>The Redwood National Park was established in 1968 and is famous for its Sequoia trees. These trees are among the tallest and oldest trees in the world. The forest is what is referred to as an old-growth forest, which has been able to grow for hundreds of years without disturbance.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-redwood-national-park-get-its-name>How did the Redwood National Park get its name?</h2>
<p>How the park got its name: Redwood National and State Parks were named for the coastal redwoods that line this one of a kind area on the California Coast. Sempervirens is the scientific name for coastal redwoods and it means everlasting.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-special-about-the-redwood-national-park>What is special about the Redwood National Park?</h2>
<p>Established in 1968, Redwood National Park is located in northernmost coastal California, and is home to old-growth coast redwoods . These magnificent trees can live to be 2,000 years old and grow to over 300 feet tall. Spruce, hemlock, Douglas-fir, berry bushes, and sword ferns create a multiple-canopied understory.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-redwood-national-and-state-parks-mean>What does Redwood National and state parks mean?</h2>
<p>The Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) are a complex of several state and national parks located in the United States, along the coast of northern California.
