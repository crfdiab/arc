<h2 id=how-many-people-work-as-a-coal-miner>How many people work as a coal miner?</h2>
<p>In 2019, the coal-mining industry in the United States employed 53,714 people. Of that number, almost 31,900 employees worked underground.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-coal-mines-in-west-virginia>Where can I find coal mines in West Virginia?</h2>
<p>Users can use the underground mine search feature to find underground mines by company or seam name. For more detailed information on the status of active coal mines and reclamation areas, you can use the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection’s Mining Data Tools.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-jobs-are-there-in-west-virginia>How many jobs are there in West Virginia?</h2>
<p>In the Appalachian region, where West Virginia is located, there were nearly 30,000 coal mining jobs in 2018, up from nearly 29,600 in 2017. In 2009, coal was extracted from 51 different coal seams in the state, and there are 65 seams located in the region that are considered economically viable.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-the-coalfields-in-west-virginia>What was life like in the coalfields in West Virginia?</h2>
<p>In the West Virginia coalfields—on the edge of which my aunt and uncle live, and where I spent holidays and vacations as a kid—the economic mood ranges from depressed to apocalyptic. At one point, more than 100,000 West Virginians worked in the mines that produced well-paying jobs and gave people money to spend.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-coal-industry-in-west-virginia-declining>Why is the coal industry in West Virginia declining?</h2>
<p>At the same time, declining coal extraction is cutting some counties’ tax revenues in half. All of these factors combine to create a downward spiral that has left the state’s governmental and healthcare finances in rapid decline, even before the arrival of COVID-19.</p>
