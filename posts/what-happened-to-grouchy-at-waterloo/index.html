<h2 id=what-happened-to-grouchy-at-waterloo>What happened to grouchy at Waterloo?</h2>
<p>One of the enduring controversies of the Waterloo campaign is the conduct of Marshal Grouchy. Grouchy, though, was not defeated. He kept his force together and retreated in good order back to France.</p>
<h2 id=who-defended-napoleon-at-the-battle-of-waterloo>Who defended Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo?</h2>
<p>the Duke of Wellington<br>
At Waterloo in Belgium, Napoleon Bonaparte suffers defeat at the hands of the Duke of Wellington, bringing an end to the Napoleonic era of European history.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-reasons-why-napoleon-lost-the-battle-at-waterloo>What are two reasons why Napoleon lost the battle at Waterloo?</h2>
<p>In the first view, historians claim that the French loss at Waterloo was a direct result of Napoleon’s own leadership blunder and inferior methods of warfare. The second argument claims that Napoleon was defeated mainly due to the superior strategy and tactics of his enemies, the Prussians and Anglo-Allies.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-napoleons-mistakes-when-fighting-at-waterloo>What were Napoleon’s mistakes when fighting at Waterloo?</h2>
<p>A combination of weather, disease, desertion, and attacks reduced his army to less than 80,000 troops by the time they left Russia. To summarize the totality of Napoleon’s mistakes during the Russian Campaign: he was unable to adapt his brilliant thinking beyond the localized context of the battlefield.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-marshal-grouchy>Where was Marshal Grouchy?</h2>
<p>Emmanuel de Grouchy, marquis de Grouchy</p>
<table><tr><th>Marshal of the Empire Emmanuel de Grouchy Marquis of Grouchy</th></tr><tr><td>Born</td><td>23 October 1766 Paris, France</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>29 May 1847 (aged 80) Saint-Étienne, France</td></tr><tr><td>Allegiance</td><td>Kingdom of France Kingdom of the French French First Republic First French Empire Bourbon Restoration (1814–1815) July Monarchy</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-does-grouchiness-mean>What does Grouchiness mean?</h2>
<p>/ˈɡraʊ.tʃi.nəs/ the quality of being easily annoyed and quick to complain: Did your boyfriend get annoyed at your grouchiness?</p>
<h2 id=what-was-napoleons-fatal-mistake-in-the-napoleonic-war>What was Napoleon’s fatal mistake in the Napoleonic War?</h2>
<p>Napoleon made three costly mistakes that led to his downfall. The first mistake was The Continental system. The second mistake was The Peninsular War. The third mistake was The Invasion of Russia.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-marshals-did-napoleon-have>How many marshals did Napoleon have?</h2>
<p>26 Marshals<br>
Throughout his reign from 1804 to 1815, Napoleon appointed a total of 26 Marshals, although their number never exceeded 20 at any one moment.</p>
<h2 id=who-won-the-battle-of-wavre>Who won the battle of Wavre?</h2>
<p>While the battle ended in a French victory, with the Prussians in retreat and Grouchy firmly athwart Prussian lines of communication to the east, this victory proved hollow. The Prussians had held their ground long enough to allow Blücher’s transfer of 72,000 troops to Wellington’s aid at Waterloo.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-marquis-de-grouchy-follow-napoleon-to-waterloo>Why did Marquis de Grouchy follow Napoleon to Waterloo?</h2>
<p>On 17 June, Grouchy was unable to close with the Prussians. Despite hearing the cannon sound from the nearby Battle of Waterloo, he decided to follow the Prussians along the route literally specified in his orders, issued by Napoleon via Marshal Soult, while the Prussian and British-Dutch armies united to crush Napoleon.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-emmanuel-de-grouchy-join-the-french-army>When did Emmanuel de Grouchy join the French army?</h2>
<p>In 1815, he joined Napoleon on his return from Elba, and was made Marshal (against the recommendation of Marshal Davout, then Minister for War) and peer of France. In the Waterloo Campaign he commanded the reserve cavalry of the army, and after Battle of Ligny he was appointed to command the right wing to pursue the Prussians.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-grouchy-do-after-the-great-disaster>What did Grouchy do after the Great Disaster?</h2>
<p>So far as resistance was possible after the great disaster, Grouchy made it. He gathered up the wrecks of Napoleon’s army and retired, swiftly and unbroken, to Paris, where, after interposing his reorganized forces between the enemy and the capital, he resigned his command into the hands of Marshal Davout.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-grouchy-win-the-battle-of-wavre>When did Grouchy win the Battle of Wavre?</h2>
<p>He won a smart victory over the III Prussian Corps in the Battle of Wavre, on 18–19 June 1815, but it was then too late, as by the time this battle was over, and Napoleon had already lost at Waterloo. So far as resistance was possible after the great disaster, Grouchy made it.</p>
