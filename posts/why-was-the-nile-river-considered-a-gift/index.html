<p>Crops could be developed in this dark, rich soil. The antiquated Egyptians considered this dirt “The Gift of the Nile”. The Nile gave different blessings to the antiquated Egyptians. Papyrus, utilized for everything, developed uncontrollably along its banks. It gave water for cooking and showering. Fish and waterfowl were ample.</p>

<p>Boats woven from river reeds continue to sail the Nile to this day. Each year around June, snow on the mountains to the south began to melt. Water ran down the mountains, into the lakes, and into the Nile riverbed. In July, floodwaters would begin to reach Lower Egypt.</p>

<p>The Nile is shaped like the lotus flower so often seen in ancient Egyptian art and hieroglyphs. The stalk is a long swaying curve and the flower is the river’s fan shaped delta at the end, where the Nile empties into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is surrounded on four sides by natural barriers.</p>
