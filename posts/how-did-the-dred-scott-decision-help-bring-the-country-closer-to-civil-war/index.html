<p>Southerners approved the Dred Scott decision believing Congress had no right to prohibit slavery in the territories. Overall, the Dred Scott decision had the effect of widening the political and social gap between North and South and took the nation closer to the brink of Civil War.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-reaction-to-the-dred-scott-decision>What was the reaction to the Dred Scott decision?</h2>
<p>Louis Circuit Court found that Scott and his family were free due to their residency in free jurisdictions. Unhappy with the decision, Irene Emerson appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri.</p>

<p>How did the Dred Scott decision contribute to the American Civil War?

<p>It was the culmination of ten years of court battles — Dred Scott’s fight to live and be recognized as a free man.

<h2 id=when-did-dred-scott-go-to-the-supreme-court>When did Dred Scott go to the Supreme Court?</h2>
<p>By 1857, when Dred Scott made it to the Supreme Court, the Northern and Southern states already had a tenuous relationship. In 1846, while living in St. Louis, Scott made his legal claim to freedom.</p>
