<h2 id=why-is-the-iss-weightless>Why is the ISS weightless?</h2>
<p>The astronauts, the ISS itself and other objects in Earth orbit aren’t floating, they are actually falling. So, as they accelerate towards the Earth, the Earth curves away beneath them and they never get any closer. Since the astronauts have the same acceleration as the space station, they feel weightless.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-incorrect-to-say-that-astronauts-are-weightless>Why is it incorrect to say that astronauts are weightless?</h2>
<p>Gravity exists everywhere in the universe. According to the formula, no matter how large the distance between objects, there is still a gravitational force. Astronauts appear weightless while in orbit around Earth because the space shuttle and the astronauts are in free fall around it.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-feel-weightless-on-moon>Do you feel weightless on moon?</h2>
<p>There is no air on the moon, but astronauts don’t float away – even when they jump.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-that-astronauts-are-weightless-in-space>Is it true that astronauts are weightless in space?</h2>
<p>The answer to this is just a bit more complicated, but the basis is that there is some gravity in space, so the weightless condition of the astronauts doesn’t have anything to do with gravity. In reality, the astronauts are actually falling and so is the space station.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-feel-weightlessness-on-the-space-station>Do you feel weightlessness on the Space Station?</h2>
<p>Since the astronauts and the space station are going at the same speed, they have a feeling of weightlessness. There are situations here on earth that you can feel the same thing that the astronauts are experiencing.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-astronauts-in-space-not-falling-to-earth>Why are astronauts in space not falling to Earth?</h2>
<p>They haven’t hit the earth due to the fact that they are falling and going very fast. It’s also speed that is keeping them from falling to earth. The combination of falling with the speed gives the astronauts and the International Space Station, along with the satellites and everything else that is floating out there, the sense of weightlessness.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-weight-of-an-elevator-in-orbit-the-same-as-on-earth>Is the weight of an elevator in orbit the same as on Earth?</h2>
<p>In all four cases, the elevator rider weighs the same amount – 784 N. Yet the rider’s sensation of his weight is fluctuating throughout the elevator ride. Earth-orbiting astronauts are weightless for the same reasons that riders of a free-falling amusement park ride or a free-falling elevator are weightless.</p>
