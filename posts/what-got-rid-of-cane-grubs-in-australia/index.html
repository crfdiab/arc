<h2 id=what-got-rid-of-cane-grubs-in-australia>What got rid of cane grubs in Australia?</h2>
<p>“They’re just doing what they’re good at, which is thriving and multiplying.” (Image credit: Radio Pictures P/L.) Cane toads (Bufo marinus) were a complete failure at killing Australia’s sugar cane-ravaging beetles. Instead of controlling the pests, the toads have become pests themselves.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-introduced-to-kill-cane-toads>What was introduced to kill cane toads?</h2>
<p>One native species, the Torresian crow, has learned how to kill and eat cane toads without ingesting the poison by flipping it onto its back and using its powerful bill to deliver a lethal blow to the throat where the toad’s skin is thinner, giving the crow access to the toad’s non-toxic innards.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-cane-toads-fail-to-do-as-expected>Why did cane toads fail to do as expected?</h2>
<p>Cane Toad Facts, Pictures It was introduced to Australia in 1935 to protect crops against cane beetles. The experiment failed because cane toads don’t eat adult beetles and the larvae — which they would eat — live underground. A large, stocky animal, the cane toad has dry, warty skin and ridges above its eyes.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-inventor-of-the-aussie-farm>Who was the inventor of the Aussie farm?</h2>
<p>It’s a rich heritage which has yielded dozens of technical breakthroughs, but we’ve narrowed them down to a showcase of the inventions that made the most impact on farmers here and overseas. Immortalised in bronze at Henty, Headlie Taylor is recognised as the inventor who revolutionised grain harvesting with his Aussie farm invention.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-farmers-in-australia>What is the role of farmers in Australia?</h2>
<p>Farmers are at the frontline of delivering environmental outcomes on behalf of the Australian community, with 94 percent of Australian farmers actively undertaking natural resource management. The NFF was a founding partner of the Landcare movement, which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-farm-businesses-are-there-in-australia>How many farm businesses are there in Australia?</h2>
<p>There are approximately 85,681 farm businesses in Australia, 99 percent of which are family owned and operated. Each Australian farmer produces enough food each year to feed 600 people, 150 at home and 450 overseas. Australian farms produce around 93 percent of the total volume of food consumed in Australia.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-drought-affecting-farmers-in-australia>How is the drought affecting farmers in Australia?</h2>
<p>The plight of drought-hit farmers in Australia has prompted an outpouring of sympathy across a country that has long mythologised the inhospitable “bush” and its inhabitants. But it has also raised questions about subsidising those eking a living in agriculturally marginal areas, writes Kathy Marks in Sydney.</p>
