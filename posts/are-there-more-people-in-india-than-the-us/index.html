<h2 id=are-there-more-people-in-india-than-the-us>Are there more people in India than the US?</h2>
<p>United States is about 3 times bigger than India. India is approximately 3,287,263 sq km, while United States is approximately 9,833,517 sq km, making United States 199% larger than India. Meanwhile, the population of India is ~1.3 billion people (993.5 million fewer people live in United States).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-population-of-india-in-usa>What is the population of India in USA?</h2>
<p>According to the 2010 United States Census, the Asian Indian population in the United States grew from almost 1,678,765 in 2000 (0.6% of U.S. population) to 2,843,391 in 2010 (0.9% of U.S. population), a growth rate of 69.37%, one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-the-populations-of-the-united-states-and-india-compare-today>How do the populations of the United States and India compare today?</h2>
<p>How do the populations of the United States and India compare today? India has almost four times the population of the United States.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-indians-live-in-the-united-states>How many Indians live in the United States?</h2>
<p>More than 75 percent of current first-generation Indian-Americans have immigrated to the United States since the 1990s. They make up only about 1 percent of the US population ( 3.9 million as of 2017) but have disproportionate numbers of professionals such as physicians, corporate executives, and successful entrepreneurs.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-americans-live-and-work-in-india>How many Americans live and work in India?</h2>
<p>The number of Americans living in India is often estimated at 60,000. That number involves guesswork. Most Americans had not been registering with their embassy, though lately about 60 new names have been listed each day ^ “Fact Sheet: The United States and India — Prosperity Through Partnership”. White House. 26 June 2017.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-so-many-americans-coming-to-india>Why are so many Americans coming to India?</h2>
<p>In a break from the long tradition of older American expatriates coming to India to manage local subsidiaries of American companies, a trend began in the 2000s of younger Americans taking jobs at Indian companies, especially in the information technology sector, often at lower wages than they had previously earned in the U.S.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-americans-live-in-mumbai-india>How many Americans live in Mumbai, India?</h2>
<p>However this conflicted with another figure given by the head of the U.S. consulate in Mumbai, who estimated that there were 9,000 living in Mumbai and its surroundings alone, representing almost 0,1% of its total population. Fictional portrayals include Paul Theroux ‘s The Elephanta Suite.</p>
