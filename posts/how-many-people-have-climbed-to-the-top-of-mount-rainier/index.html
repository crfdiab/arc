<h2 id=how-many-people-have-climbed-to-the-top-of-mount-rainier>How many people have climbed to the top of Mount Rainier?</h2>
<p>A: It is estimated that over 500,000 people have attempted Mt. Rainier with about 200,000 summiting and around100 have died since 1887, mostly from falls or avalanches. The National Park Service states that about 10,000 attempt the summit summit each year and 50% succeed.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-climb-rainier-a-year>How many people climb Rainier a year?</h2>
<p>Each year, about 2 million people visit the park to throw snowballs, hike in the footsteps of John Muir and snap adventurous-looking selfies. People come to climb the mountain, too. More than 10,000 people try for the summit each year, according to the National Park Service.</p>

<p>Although climbing carries inherent risks, it’s not how most deaths in the sprawling Mount Rainier National Park occur. Of the 425 fatalities recorded over more than a century — 1897 to 2017 — about 90 were summit climbers, in addition to 35 or so climbing accidents that were non-summit related, park data shows.</p>
