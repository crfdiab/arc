<h2 id=how-did-alexander-kerensky-affect-the-russian-revolution>How did Alexander Kerensky affect the Russian revolution?</h2>
<p>Kerensky was the leading political figure in the first months after the February Revolution and became the Russian Revolution’s first cult of personality. He was renowned for his stirring and emotional oratory, his commitment to coalition government, and to Russia’s continued engagement in the war.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-russias-decision-to-launch-the-kerensky-offensive-unwise>Why was Russia’s decision to launch the Kerensky Offensive unwise?</h2>
<p>The Russian provisional government was greatly weakened by this military catastrophe, and the possibility of a Bolshevik Revolution became increasingly real. Far from strengthening Russian army morale, this offensive proved that Russian army morale no longer existed.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-downfall-of-the-russian-revolution>What was the downfall of the Russian revolution?</h2>
<p>Civil War broke out in Russia in late 1917 after the Bolshevik Revolution. The warring factions included the Red and White Armies.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-in-the-kerensky-offensive>What happened in the Kerensky Offensive?</h2>
<p>On July 1 (June 18, Old Style), 1917, the Russian army, commanded by General Aleksey A. Brusilov, attacked the Austro-German forces along a broad front in Galicia and pushed toward Lvov. Although the Russian effort was initially successful, the soldiers soon refused to leave their trenches and fight.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-lead-to-the-russian-revolution>What causes lead to the Russian revolution?</h2>
<p>Causes of the Russian Revolution. Economically, widespread inflation and food shortages in Russia contributed to the revolution. Militarily, inadequate supplies, logistics, and weaponry led to heavy losses that the Russians suffered during World War I; this further weakened Russia’s view of Nicholas II.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-june-offensive-fail>Why did the June offensive fail?</h2>
<p>It was ill-timed as after the February Revolution there were calls for peace, especially within army who were exhausted from the war effort. A lack of discipline in the army which was fuelled by the Petrograd Soviet and Bolshevik agitators, created a defeatist attitude.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-march-revolution-important-to-russia>Why was the March Revolution important to Russia?</h2>
<p>The March Revolution | The Russian Revolution of 1917. The Soviet located its headquarters in the same building as the Duma and was soon in conflict with it. The Duma wanted to get its provisional government functioning quickly, to restore public order, and to carry on the war with efficiency for the honor of Russia.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-russian-revolution>Who was the leader of the Russian Revolution?</h2>
<p>Alexander Kerensky. Alexander Kerensky (1881-1970) was a Russian revolutionary and politician of liberal-socialist persuasions. In the eight months between February and October 1917, Kerensky was Russia’s most significant national leader, serving as justice minister, war minister and prime minister in the Provisional Government.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-russian-provisional-government-a-failure>Why was the Russian Provisional Government a failure?</h2>
<p>Many were unhappy because it appeared that the Provisional Government was no different to the Tsar’s Government. The Foreign Minister who sent the note was forced to resign and order was restored by the Soviet. In June 1917 a new Russian offensive failed with heavy casualties.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-russia-angry-at-the-start-of-the-revolution>Why was Russia angry at the start of the Revolution?</h2>
<p>Rasputin was dead and Lenin was out of the country. By the start of 1917, the people of Russia were very angry. Why? The First World War had cost Russia millions of lives. Those not actually fighting had to face serious food shortages. The winter of 1916-17 was very cold and fuel was in very short supply.</p>
