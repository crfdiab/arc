<h2 id=how-long-would-it-take-to-deliver-presents-to-every-house>How long would it take to deliver presents to every house?</h2>
<p>With 500 million households to visit and 42 hours to do it in, that means Santa has a total of just 300 microseconds (0.0003 seconds) to accomplish everything he needs to accomplish per household.</p>
<h2 id=how-fast-would-santa-claus-have-to-travel>How fast would Santa Claus have to travel?</h2>
<p>Using these figures, Santa Claus would have to travel at a speed of 1.56 x 106 m/s. That’s about 0.5% the speed of light. The students also derived the size of the aerofoils Santa would need in order to stay airborne. They found this to be approximately 1.26 x 10-3 m2.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-houses-does-santa-visit>How many houses does Santa visit?</h2>
<p>396 million houses<br>
Santa has to visit nearly 396 million houses.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-place-to-travel-in-asia>Which is the best place to travel in Asia?</h2>
<p>Beyond lie floating villages on the Tonlé Sap lake, adrenaline-fuelled activities like quad biking and ziplining, and such cultured pursuits as cooking classes and birdwatching. Topping many people’s travel bucket list is a two-week-long trek to the base of the world’s highest, and most hyped, mountain.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-visited-country-in-southeast-asia>Which is the most visited country in Southeast Asia?</h2>
<p>Most visitors coming into the region fly into Bangkok and make that their base for doing the circuit as they backpack around Southeast Asia. It’s the most visited country in the region – and with good reason! Thailand speaks for itself. When you hear its name, you already think about beaches, beauty, jungles, and food.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-asia-separated-from-the-rest-of-the-world>How is Asia separated from the rest of the world?</h2>
<p>Asia is separated from North America to the northeast by the Bering Strait and from Australia to the southeast by the seas and straits connecting the Indian and Pacific oceans. The Isthmus of Suez unites Asia with Africa, and it is generally agreed that the Suez Canal forms the border between them.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-most-of-the-people-in-asia-come-from>Where do most of the people in Asia come from?</h2>
<p>More recent migrations have originated in China, with destinations throughout Southeast Asia. The Korean and Japanese peoples and, to a lesser extent, the Chinese have remained ethnically more homogeneous than the populations of other Asian countries. Asia’s population is unevenly distributed, mainly because of climatic factors.</p>
