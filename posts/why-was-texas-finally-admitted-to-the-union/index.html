<h2 id=why-was-texas-finally-admitted-to-the-union>Why was Texas finally admitted to the Union?</h2>
<p>Texas was admitted to the Union as the 28th state on December 29, 1845. His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States.</p>

<p>twenty-eighth<br>
On December 29, 1845, Texas officially became the twenty-eighth state in the Union although the formal transfer of government did not take place until February 19, 1846. A unique provision in its agreement with the United States permitted Texas to retain title to its public lands.</p>

<p>In the end, Texas was admitted to the United States a slave state. The annexation of Texas contributed to the coming of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848).
