<p>Today about one-half of U.S. Pequot live on or near two reservations in Connecticut: the Eastern Paucatuck Pequot Reservation in New London and the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation in Mashantucket. The other half live mainly in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-pequot-tribe-exist-today>Does the Pequot tribe exist today?</h2>
<p>Today, the Mashantucket Pequot population consists of more than 1100 enrolled members. As a federally recognized tribe, the Mashantucket Pequots have the authority to determine their membership criteria.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-homes-did-the-pequot-natives-live-in>What type of homes did the Pequot natives live in?</h2>
<p>The Pequot tribe lived in fortified villages of multi-family residences of longhouses in the winter, that were surrounded by strong palisades (fencing). In the summer when they went on hunting expeditions they built a temporary domed or pyramid shaped shelter called a wigwam or wetu.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-pequot>What happened to the Pequot?</h2>
<p>At the end, about 700 Pequots had been killed or taken into captivity. Hundreds of prisoners were sold into slavery to colonists in Bermuda or the West Indies; other survivors were dispersed as captives to the victorious tribes….Pequot War.</p>

<h2 id=what-did-the-pequots-eat>What did the Pequots eat?</h2>
<p>Pequot women plant ed corn, squash and beans and also gathered nuts and fruit to eat. Pequot men did most of the hunting. They shot deer, turkeys, and small game, and went fishing on the coast. Pequot Indian recipes included soup, cornbread, and stews.</p>
<h2 id=are-pequots-really-pequots>Are Pequots really Pequots?</h2>
<p>In the early ’70s, the Pequots didn’t exist, at least as far as the federal government was concerned. There was just a small reservation given to the remnants of the tribe by the state of Connecticut. He settled for an act of Congress officially recognizing the Pequot as a tribe.</p>

<h2 id=why-did-the-english-get-rid-of-the-pequots>Why did the English get rid of the Pequots?</h2>
<p>Pequot War, war fought in 1636–37 by the Pequot people against a coalition of English settlers from the Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, and Saybrook colonies and their Native American allies (including the Narragansett and Mohegan) that eliminated the Pequot as an impediment to English colonization of southern New …</p>
<h2 id=what-weapons-did-they-use-in-the-pequot-war>What weapons did they use in the Pequot War?</h2>
<p>Shoulder-fired matchlock guns—variously known as arquebuses, hackbuts, calivers, culverins, and eventually muskets—had many drawbacks, most notably their unreliability in wet weather and the fact that the smoldering match could betray the firer’s position to the enemy.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-pequot-indians-live-in-new-england>Where did the Pequot Indians live in New England?</h2>
<p>There are two Pequot Indian bands in Connecticut, which is the original homeland of the Pequot tribe. There are also people of Pequot heritage living among the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes, and vice versa. When Europeans arrived in New England, they brought European diseases with them, and many Native Americans died.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-pequot-indian-tribe-the-same-as-the-us-government>Is the Pequot Indian tribe the same as the US government?</h2>
<p>Though both bands belong to the same cultural group, they live in different locations and each one has its own government. Like other Native Americans in the United States, Pequot Indian tribes have their own reservations. A reservation is land that belongs to an Indian tribe and is under their control.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-members-of-the-mashantucket-pequot-tribe>Who are the members of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe?</h2>
<p>Modern Pequots are members of the federally recognized Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, four other state-recognized groups in Connecticut including the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation, or the Brothertown Indians of Wisconsin.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-pequot-tribe-the-same-as-the-mohegan-tribe>Is the Pequot tribe the same as the Mohegan Tribe?</h2>
<p>The Pequots and Mohegans are two different tribes. They were once the same tribe, but the Mohegans broke away from the Pequots and formed their own tribe. The two tribes still speak the same language and share many cultural traits, but they have different leadership, similar to American and British people today.</p>
