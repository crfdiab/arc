<h2 id=can-a-20-year-old-date-a-16-year-old-in-kentucky>Can a 20 year old date a 16 year old in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>It is legal for a person to have sex with someone who is under the age of consent so long as both parties are at least 14 years old and under 21 years old. However, if the defendant is 21 years old or older and the victim is under the age of 17, then it is second degree statutory rape or statutory sodomy.</p>

<p>18 years old<br>
The age of consent in California is 18 years old. However, the age of consent in Nevada is just 16.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-16-year-old-marry-a-19-year-old-in-kentucky>Can a 16 year old marry a 19 year old in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Under KRS 402.020, no one under the age of 18 may legally marry in Kentucky, except that a 17 year old may petition a district or family court to obtain permission to get married. If the intended spouse is more than 4 years older than the minor, then the petition will be denied.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-has-no-age-of-consent>What country has no age of consent?</h2>
<p>Some nations, however, do not have a specified age of consent as they forbid sexual relations outside of marriage. Nigeria, an African nation, has the lowest age of consent in the world while Bahrain, a country in Asia, has the highest legal age of consent.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-commit-a-sex-crime-in-kentucky>How old do you have to be to commit a sex crime in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>The ages for Kentucky sex crime laws can be complicated. The years 12, 14, 16, 18, and 21 are all significant in the Kentucky Revised Statutes for sex crimes. And sometimes it matters whether the actor is more than 5 years older than the victim.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-age-of-consent-in-tennessee>What is the age of consent in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>TENNESSEE: Age of consent is 18. If a person is between the ages of 13 and 18, but the other person is within four (4) years, it is not a crime. Anyone under 18 who is charged must be tried as a juvenile. Tenn. Code Ann. §39-13-528.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-legal-age-of-consent-in-the-united-states>What’s the legal age of consent in the United States?</h2>
<p>Age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-close-in-age-exemption-in-kentucky>Is there a close in age exemption in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Kentucky does not have a close-in-age exemption. Close in age exemptions, commonly known as “Romeo and Juliet laws”, are put in place to prevent the prosecution of individuals who engage in consensual sexual activity when both participants are significantly close in age to each other, and one or both partners are below the age of consent.</p>
