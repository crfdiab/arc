<h2 id=what-changes-were-made-to-the-tennessee-constitution>What changes were made to the Tennessee constitution?</h2>
<p>The constitution was revised again in 1870 after the Civil War. The biggest change in this version of the constitution was the permanent abolition of slavery in Tennessee. Another purpose of the framers of this constitution was a reaction against the overreaching actions of Governor William G. Brownlow.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-three-significant-changes-to-the-tennessee-constitution-in-1834>What were three significant changes to the Tennessee constitution in 1834?</h2>
<p>Local justices of the peace, county trustees, and county registers were now popularly elected. Predictably, the tax structure of the state was changed. All property was to be taxed according to its value, and the new constitution gave the counties the power to impose taxes for county purposes.</p>
<h2 id=why-didnt-tn-have-any-representation-at-the-constitutional-convention>Why didn’t TN have any representation at the Constitutional Convention?</h2>
<p>The Federalists knew that Tennesseans would more likely vote for Thomas Jefferson, an Anti-Federalist, and they didn’t want give more electoral votes to Jefferson. (As it turned out, even with Tennessee’s votes going to Jefferson, John Adams, a Federalist, won the election in 1796.)</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-importance-of-tennessees-first-constitution>What was the importance of Tennessee’s first constitution?</h2>
<p>Congress required a constitution before it would grant statehood. The state constitution was based on the United States Constitution. Tennessee’s first constitution was called the “least imperfect and most republican” one of its time by Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-new-constitution-change-voting-rights-in-tennessee>How did the new constitution change voting rights in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>In making suffrage changes, the delegates restricted the vote to white men, thereby disfranchising free black males, who had voted under the 1796 Constitution. A variety of other issues were addressed.</p>
<h2 id=what-tax-was-originally-authorized-by-the-tennessee-constitution>What tax was originally authorized by the Tennessee Constitution?</h2>
<p>poll tax<br>
Instead, the convention authorized a poll tax in the Constitution as a tool for controlling who voted. To prevent the evils of Brownlowism from returning to the state, the convention enshrined in the Constitution certain restrictions on the governor’s power, namely, that he: 1. Could not suspend habeas corpus 2.</p>
<h2 id=what-tax-was-originally-authorized-by-the-tennessee-constitution-1>What tax was originally authorized by the Tennessee constitution?</h2>
<h2 id=who-did-the-tennessee-constitution-give-the-right-to-vote-1834>Who did the Tennessee Constitution give the right to vote 1834?</h2>
<p>Every free white man of the age of twenty-one years, being a citizen of the United States, and a citizen of the county wherein he may offer his vote, six months next preceding the day of election, shall be entitled to vote for Members of the general Assembly, and other civil officers, for the county or district in …</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-changes-to-tennessees-constitution-in-1834-affect-free-black-males>How did the changes to Tennessee’s constitution in 1834 affect free black males?</h2>
<p>In making suffrage changes, the delegates restricted the vote to white men, thereby disfranchising free black males, who had voted under the 1796 Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=who-makes-the-laws-in-tennessee>Who makes the laws in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>the General Assembly<br>
The lawmaking power of the state is given to its Legislature, named the General Assembly. The upper house is the Senate and the lower house is the House of Representatives (Section 3).</p>
<h2 id=is-the-tennessee-senate-going-to-remove-slavery>Is the Tennessee Senate going to remove slavery?</h2>
<p>— The Tennessee Senate on Monday advanced a proposal that would remove a clause in the state’s constitution allowing slavery or involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-process-for-amending-the-tennessee-constitution>What’s the process for amending the Tennessee Constitution?</h2>
<p>Amending the state constitution is a lengthy process in Tennessee. Proposed changes must pass by a majority in both chambers during one two-year General Assembly, and then pass by at least two-thirds of the vote in the next. The amendment would then go before the voters in the year of the next gubernatorial election, which is in 2022.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-constitution-say-about-slavery-in-tennessee>What does the constitution say about slavery in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>Currently, the Tennessee Constitution states that “slavery and involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, are forever prohibited in this state.”</p>
<h2 id=when-was-tennessee-ceded-to-the-united-states>When was Tennessee ceded to the United States?</h2>
<p>In 1789 North Carolina ratified the United States Constitution and ceded its Tennessee lands to the Federal government. This area was now designated as the “Territory of the United States, South of the River Ohio,” more commonly known as the “Southwest Territory.”</p>
