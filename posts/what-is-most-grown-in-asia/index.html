<h2 id=what-is-most-grown-in-asia>What is most grown in Asia?</h2>
<p>Rice is the staple food crop for most Asians. Wheat is also the dominant crop in Central Asia (notably Kazakhstan), the Middle East, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Grain crops, chiefly wheat, are cultivated in North China—where soybeans are also grown—and in Japan. Barley is grown in China and India, among other countries.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-they-grow-in-asia>What do they grow in Asia?</h2>
<p>Major crops are wheat and maize, with smaller areas of rice, cotton, soybeans, sweet potato and rape – depending on local temperature and water conditions – as well as citrus and some temperate fruits. Livestock are important, particularly cattle, pigs and poultry.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-common-type-of-farming-in-asia>What is the most common type of farming in Asia?</h2>
<p>Among the traditional systems, intensive subsistence agriculture in which rice cultivation is the most predominant crop prevails largely in Southeast Asia and East Asia.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-important-fossil-fuel-in-asia>Which is the most important fossil fuel in Asia?</h2>
<p>Since 2000, overall energy demand has grown by more than 80% and the lion’s share of this growth has been met by a doubling in fossil fuel use. Oil is the largest element in the regional energy mix and coal – largely for power generation – has been the fastest growing.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-top-10-richest-countries-in-asia>Who are the top 10 richest countries in Asia?</h2>
<p>Here are the 10 richest countries in Asia: 1 China ( $11.22 Tn) 2 Japan ( $4.94 Tn) 3 India ( $2.26 Tn) 4 South Korea ( $1.41 Tn) 5 Indonesia ( $932.26 Bn) 6 Turkey ( $863.71 Bn) 7 Saudi Arabia ( $639.62 Bn) 8 Iran ( $425.40 Bn) 9 Thailand ( $407.03 Bn) 10 United Arab Emirates ( $348.74 Bn)</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-important-cash-crop-in-asia>Which is the most important cash crop in Asia?</h2>
<p>Cash crops. Asia is noted for several plantation cash crops, of which the most important are tea, rubber, palm oil, coconuts, and sugarcane. Jute, a commercial fibre, though it has decreased in significance, remains a major export crop of Bangladesh. Cotton is important to the states of Central Asia and is also a major crop in India and Pakistan.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-wealth-of-a-country-determined-in-asia>How is the wealth of a country determined in Asia?</h2>
<p>Asia is a continent with countries at either extreme, as there are some very poor countries and other countries that are some of the richest in the world. The wealth of a country is decided based on the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, which is a measure of a country’s economy in relation to the population.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-fastest-growing-country-in-asia>Which is the fastest growing country in Asia?</h2>
<p>According to the figures, the most noteworthy high-growth developing Asian countries for 2020 and beyond are… Bangladesh — 8%; growth driven by foreign investment in low-cost textiles, garments and shoes. India — 7.2%; growth powered by manufactured goods and electronics.</p>
