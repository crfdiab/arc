<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-of-wildlife-conservation>What are the advantages of wildlife conservation?</h2>
<p>1) To maintain the stability of food chains. Killing of animals disturbs many food chains. 2) To preserve the gene pool. 3) When we conserve wildlife , many species of wildlife are saved from extinction.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-problems-of-wildlife-conservation>What are the problems of wildlife conservation?</h2>
<p>Climate change is quickly becoming the biggest threat to the long-term survival of America’s wildlife. Habitat loss, climate change, and a lack of biodiversity can all make ecosystems unhealthy, putting wildlife at greater risk for disease.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-wildlife-sanctuaries>What are the disadvantages of wildlife sanctuaries?</h2>
<p>Answer: Disadvantage is that perhaps the current wildlife conservation actions are doing more harm then good. Or that they are favouring certain plant or animal species over that of others (which may be more important for the ecosystem).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-of-conservation-of-forest-and-wildlife>What are the advantages of conservation of forest and wildlife?</h2>
<p>Advantages of conserving wildlife: – It protects the endangered species. – It preserves different kinds of species and thus, maintains the species diversity. – It helps in maintaining the ecological balance that is required for supporting life.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-conserve-forest-and-wildlife>Why is it important to conserve forest and wildlife?</h2>
<p>The primary reason to conserve forests and wildlife is to provide oxygen to breathe. Forests provide shelter to a wide range of animals. If the trees are destroyed, these animals also die as they do not have their natural habitat. This destruction makes many of the endangered species of plants and animals extinct.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-wildlife-conservation>What are the pros and cons of wildlife conservation?</h2>
<p>Zoo advocates argue that the conservation and research of endangered species is necessary to keep them from extinction, they fight for humane treatment of animals around the world and work hard to show the real problem in today’s environment.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-conservation-of-wild-animals-a-good-thing>Is the conservation of wild animals a good thing?</h2>
<p>Wildlife Conservation is often seen as a bad thing, but if you look at it from my perspective, then it is actually a good thing. People think of it as holding wild animals captive, but we are actually protecting them from poachers.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-you-choose-a-career-in-wildlife-conservation>Why did you choose a career in wildlife conservation?</h2>
<p>By choosing a career in conservation you can help protect these endangered species and eco systems and help make a real difference. It is Very Rewarding Work. The main reason people choose a career in wildlife conservation is for the ultimate reward and sense of achievement.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-nature>What are the pros and cons of nature?</h2>
<p>The pros of nature conservation are that you allow animals and plants and biodiversity to thrive. All life up till now has been possible because of the interactions between millions of species and their impact on each other and the environment.</p>
