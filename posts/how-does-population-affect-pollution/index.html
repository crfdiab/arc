<h2 id=how-does-population-affect-pollution>How does population affect pollution?</h2>
<p>Population pressure on cities leads to air, water, noise and other environmental pollution as well as decrease in housing facilities and in green vegetation. Problems resulting from population pressures on industrial development include industrial and environmental pollution and unemployment.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-the-population-increased>What would happen if the population increased?</h2>
<p>The human population is predicted to reach around 10 billion by 2050. As the population increases, the yield of food from farming will also have to increase or malnutrition and starvation will occur.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-increased-population-affect-the-environment>How does increased population affect the environment?</h2>
<p>2﻿ Population is growing rapidly, far outpacing the ability of our planet to support it, given current practices. Overpopulation is associated with negative environmental and economic outcomes ranging from the impacts of over-farming, deforestation, and water pollution to eutrophication and global warming.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-world-becomes-overpopulated>What happens when the world becomes overpopulated?</h2>
<p>Human overpopulation, continued population growth, and overconsumption are the primary drivers of biodiversity loss and the 6th (and ongoing) mass species extinction. Present extinction rates may be as high as 140,000 species lost per year due to human activity.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-pollution-in-the-future>What are the effects of pollution in the future?</h2>
<p>Although environmental health and safety groups work to increase awareness of the danger pollution presents, if pollution continues at its current rate, the future effects could be devastating to human populations and the environment. Pollution has an adverse impact on wildlife and will continue to do so well into the future.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-planet-if-the-population-keeps-growing>What happens to the planet if the population keeps growing?</h2>
<p>25 Things That Would Happen to the Planet If the Population Keeps Growing 1 Increased rates of respiratory disease. The increase in air pollution that a larger population would inevitably cause… 2 More lung and bladder cancer. Air pollution doesn’t just cause asthma. Rather, the International …</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-increase-in-population-affect-the-world>How does the increase in population affect the world?</h2>
<p>Increased density of population. Now multiply this problem a dozen fold and we can see how it’s going to have a global effect. It will put pressure on economies and even halt whatever progress the country has managed to achieve. However, rate of growth should not be the only measurement of overpopulation.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-overpopulation-on-the-environment>What are the effects of overpopulation on the environment?</h2>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the global population will increase to 8 billion by 2025, and as the population increases, the demand for natural resources will increase as well. Although some regions are more populated than others, overpopulation has repercussions for the environment and everyone who shares it.</p>
