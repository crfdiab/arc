<h2 id=how-block-mountain-are-found>How block mountain are found?</h2>
<p>Block Mountains are formed when two tectonic plates move away from each other causing cracks on the surface of the Earth. When parallel cracks or faults occur, the strip of land or the block of land between them may be raised resulting in the formation of block mountains. The upward block is called a horst.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-fault-block-mountain-a-valley>Is a fault-block mountain a valley?</h2>
<p>Fault-block mountains often result from rifting, an indicator of extensional tectonics. These can be small or form extensive rift valley systems, such as the East African Rift zone.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-a-fault-block-mountain-created>How is a fault-block mountain created?</h2>
<p>Fault-block mountains are formed by the movement of large crustal blocks when forces in the Earth’s crust pull it apart. Some parts of the Earth are pushed upward and others collapse down. The surface of the Earth can move along these faults, and displace rock layers on either side.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-tallest-fault-block-mountain>What is the tallest fault block mountain?</h2>
<p>Mauna Kea<br>
Measured from the base, Mauna Kea stands 33,474 feet (10,203 meters) tall, though it only rises 13,796 feet (4,205 meters) above the sea.</p>
<h2 id=what-stress-causes-fault-block-mountains>What stress causes fault block mountains?</h2>
<p>Fault Block Mountains: Tension force pulls rock apart causing normal faults. Two normal faults cut through a block of rock, the hanging wall between each slips downward, the rock between moves upward, forming a fault-block mountain.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-a-fault-block-mountain>What do you call a fault block mountain?</h2>
<p>The mountains formed in this fashion are known as fault block mountains. Geologically, the rise is known as a horst, whereas the corresponding depression is known as a graben.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-fault-blocks-in-the-sierra-nevada-mountains>Are there fault blocks in the Sierra Nevada mountains?</h2>
<p>Some of the most spectacular mountain scenery anywhere are the great rock walls of the Sierra Nevada which are actually the sides of huge tilted fault blocks. The Sierra Nevada are in fact the broken upper edge of a huge plate that tilts down toward the west to nearly five miles below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-types-of-block-mountains>What are the two types of block mountains?</h2>
<p>There are two main types of block mountains; uplifted blocks between two faults and tilted blocks mainly controlled by one fault.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-landforms-are-formed-by-fault-blocks>What kind of landforms are formed by fault blocks?</h2>
<p>However vertical movement of blocks produces much more dramatic results. Landforms (mountains, hills, ridges, lakes, valleys, etc.) are sometimes formed when the faults have a large vertical displacement. Adjacent raised blocks (horsts) and down-dropped blocks (grabens) can form high escarpments.</p>
