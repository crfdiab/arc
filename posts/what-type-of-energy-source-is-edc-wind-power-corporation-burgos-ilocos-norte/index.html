<h2 id=what-type-of-energy-source-is-edc-wind-power-corporation-burgos-ilocos-norte>What type of energy source is EDC wind power Corporation Burgos Ilocos Norte?</h2>
<p>Burgos consists of 50 Vestas V90 wind turbines with a rated capacity of 3MW each. “The 150MW Burgos wind farm in Ilocos Norte is the biggest wind farm in the Philippines.”</p>
<h2 id=do-ilocanos-benefit-from-wind-turbines>Do ilocanos benefit from wind turbines?</h2>
<p>Official sources said the Windmills supply 40 percent of Ilocos Norte’s electricity through its connection to the Luzon Grid, delivering power via Transco Laoag and reaches households as far south as Badoc and Pinili via the Ilocos Norte Electric Cooperative.</p>
<h2 id=what-and-where-does-the-location-of-the-wind-power-plant-that-has-150-mw-capacity-of-generating-electricity>What and where does the location of the wind power plant that has 150 MW capacity of generating electricity?</h2>
<p>The 150 MW Burgos Wind Farm is the largest wind power project in Southeast Asia and is located within a 600-hectare site. The facility consists of 50 wind turbines, each with a capacity of 3 MW, generating electricity to the Luzon Grid.</p>
<h2 id=what-source-of-energy-is-utilized-in-ilocos-norte>What source of energy is utilized in Ilocos Norte?</h2>
<p>With its solar, wind and hydroelectric-energy sources, Ilocos Norte is already generating about 50 percent of its power requirement from clean or renewable energy. With a 264-megawatt installed wind- energy capacity as of 2015, Ilocos Norte is already dubbed the undisputed wind-energy capital of the Philippines.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-disadvantages-of-wind-turbines>What are some disadvantages of wind turbines?</h2>
<p>The two major disadvantages of wind power include initial cost and technology immaturity. Firstly, constructing turbines and wind facilities is extremely expensive. The second disadvantage is technology immaturity.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-not-considered-a-renewable-source-of-energy>Which is not considered a renewable source of energy?</h2>
<p>Nonrenewable energy resources include coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear energy. Once these resources are used up, they cannot be replaced, which is a major problem for humanity as we are currently dependent on them to supply most of our energy needs.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-you-think-philippines-can-be-the-potential-biggest-wind-energy-farm>Why do you think Philippines can be the potential biggest wind energy farm?</h2>
<p>PHILIPPINES-TOP-WIND-ENERGY-PRODUCER-ASEAN-453487 Proximity to a coastline and elevation make the country very rich in wind resources, according to Zubiri. “We have plenty of potential wind farms because we are a mountainous archipelago. Our many islands provide us an extensive coastline with good elevation,” he said.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-ilocos-sur-located-in-the-philippines>Where is Ilocos Sur located in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Ilocos Sur is bordered by Ilocos Norte and Abra to the north, Mountain Province to the east, La Union and Benguet to the south, and the South China Sea to the west. Ilocos Sur is subdivided into 32 municipalities and 2 cities.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-industries-in-ilocos-norte>What are the major industries in Ilocos Norte?</h2>
<p>Major industries include agriculture-based like crop production, mining, manufacturing and cottage industries. Located on the northwestern coast of Luzon island, it includes four (4) provinces: Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union and Pangasinan.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-ilocos-norte-separated-from-the-philippines>When was Ilocos Norte separated from the Philippines?</h2>
<p>A royal decree of February 2, 1818 separated Ilocos Norte from Ilocos Sur, the latter to include the northern part of La Union (as far as Namacpacan, now Luna) and all of what is now the province of Abra. The sub-province of Lepanto and Amburayan in Mt. Province were annexed to Ilocos Sur.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-way-to-travel-to-ilocos-norte>Which is the best way to travel to Ilocos Norte?</h2>
<p>Ilocos remains one of the top tourist destinations in the Philippines. The most common option to get to Ilocos Sur and Ilocos Norte is by bus with 10-12 hours travel time. Van transport is another alternative especially when you’re travelling as a group. Our visit to Ilocos on the other hand is done thru roadtrip.</p>
