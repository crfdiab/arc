<h2 id=how-much-does-it-rain-in-the-andes>How much does it rain in the Andes?</h2>
<p>The rain fall in the summer averages less than 8 in. In the winter it averages less than 4 in. These numbers are from biomes in and around the Andes Mountains. The Andes Mountain climate extends from at latitude 10°North latitude to 50° South and longitude 65° to 80° West.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-most-rainfall-in-the-andes>Where is the most rainfall in the Andes?</h2>
<p>Hotspot regions are identified at low elevations in the Andes foothills (400–700 masl) and in windward conditions, which is the case of Quincemil-San Gabán (Peru) and in Chipiriri-Cristal Mayu (Bolivia), where more than 4000 mm rain fall per year.</p>
<h2 id=does-it-rain-often-in-the-andes-mountains>Does it rain often in the Andes Mountains?</h2>
<p>The precipitation of the Andes Mountain climate changes but not drastically between two places. In Colombia there is a lot of rainfall all year round. In Ecuador there is the desert climate without much rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-plants-grow-in-the-andes-mountains>What kind of plants grow in the Andes Mountains?</h2>
<p>Agriculture in the lowlands is pretty developed in all the Andes, the main crops are: Cotton, Sugar Cane, Soya Beans, Coffee Beans, citric fruits like: Orange, Lime, Lemon, and Mandarin, some kind of tubers like: Walusa and Yucca, Coconut, Bananas, Mango Fruit, Coca Leaves, and much more.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-climate-in-the-andes-mountains>How is the climate in the Andes Mountains?</h2>
<p>64°F, and the southern part has an average of 71°F. In winter the temperatures usually averages about less than 52°F. In the summer it usually averages 68°F. These temperatures are mainly from biomes around and in the Andes Mountains. The precipitation of the Andes Mountain climate changes but not drastically between two places.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-precipitation-different-on-both-sides-of-the-andes>How is precipitation different on both sides of the Andes?</h2>
<p>In the subtropical Andes (25–35°S), annual mean precipitation is similar on both sides, however, it falls from convective and stratiform precipitating clouds in the warm semester on the eastern slopes, and from stratiform precipitating clouds in the cold semester, mostly as frozen particles, on the western slopes.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-it-rain-in-buenos-aires-argentina>How often does it rain in Buenos Aires Argentina?</h2>
<p>Rainfall is well distributed throughout the year: there are 9/10 days with rainfall per month from October to April (when as mentioned, the rains mainly occur in the form of showers or thunderstorms) and 7 days per month from May to September. Here is the average precipitation.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-andes-cordillera-affect-the-climate>How does the Andes cordillera affect the climate?</h2>
<p>The prominent Andes cordillera induces significant differences in climates between its eastern and western slopes. These climatic differences are largely reflected by contrasting vegetation and ice coverages but remain poorly documented.</p>
