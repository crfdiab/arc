<h2 id=why-did-martin-luther-king-go-to-pennsylvania>Why did Martin Luther King go to Pennsylvania?</h2>
<p>Martin Luther King, Jr. had about given up on the power of love in solving social problems. He explains in his autobiography, Stride Toward Freedom, One Sunday afternoon, I traveled to Philadelphia to the Fellowship House, Broad and Girard to hear a sermon by Dr. Mordecai Johnson, president of Howard University.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-martin-luther-king-jr-fall-victim-to-the-cult-of-inevitable-progress>How did Martin Luther King Jr fall victim to the cult of inevitable progress?</h2>
<p>I felt that he had fallen victim to the nineteenth-century “cult of inevitable progress” which led him to a superficial optimism concerning man’s nature. Moreover, he came perilously close to identifying the Kingdom of God with a particular social and economic system–a tendency which should never befall the Church.</p>
