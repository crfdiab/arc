<h2 id=how-do-the-atmosphere-and-hydrosphere-interact-to-produce-hurricanes>How do the atmosphere and hydrosphere interact to produce hurricanes?</h2>
<p>(Hart, Natural Disasters and Earth System Research 2017) Hurricanes mainly interact with the atmosphere and hydrosphere due to their low air pressures and circulation over the oceans. Once making landfall, they can drastically change the geosphere and biosphere of an area.</p>
<h2 id=what-spheres-cause-hurricanes>What spheres cause hurricanes?</h2>
<p>The atmosphere can be classified into major sections based on temperature and composition. The troposphere is the focus here, as all of the weather, including hurricanes, takes place in the troposphere.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-spheres-interact-during-a-hurricane>How do spheres interact during a hurricane?</h2>
<p>A hurricane can cause extreme damage to the biosphere and the geosphere. A hurricane can leave water standing therefore sinking itself into the geosphere. The biosphere can be permanently effected because it can kill, injure, and destroy the biosphere and what the biosphere creates (buildings, parks).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-hurricane-katrina-on-the-environment>What was the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the environment?</h2>
<p>· All the pollution caused by cyclone Katrina (all the debris) was released into nearby water sources. · Flooding caused harmful chemicals to flow into various lakes, while contaminating ground water. · Caused fresh water and salt water to mix.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-hurricane-katrina-called-a-tropical-storm>Why was Hurricane Katrina called a tropical storm?</h2>
<p>Hurricane Katrina 1 Inside the area of low pressure the ocean is warm and heats the air above it. 2 As the warm air rises, more air moves in to replace it. 3 As the clouds join together they start to spin. 4 Tropical storms that form in the Atlantic or Northeast Pacific (near the United States) are called hurricanes</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cost-of-the-hurricane-katrina>What was the cost of the Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>Katrina was one of the deadliest and costliest hurricanes to hit the United States. It killed over 1,500 and caused an estimated $80–$100 billion in damages. The storm’s destruction spread along the U.S. central Gulf Coast, from central Florida to Texas.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-at-the-time-of-hurricane-katrina>Who was president at the time of Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>George W Bush was the 43rd American President who served in office from January 20, 2001 to January 20, 2009. One of the important events during his presidency was the devastating weather phenomena called Hurricane Katrina.</p>
