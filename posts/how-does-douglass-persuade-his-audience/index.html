<h2 id=how-does-douglass-persuade-his-audience>How does Douglass persuade his audience?</h2>
<p>Douglass, who published his account of slavery in 1845, knows that he can appeal to his white Christian audience through their religious beliefs. Therefore, he uses Christianity as common ground to sway his readers against slavery. Douglass uses appeals to the common humanity he shares with his white readers.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-frederick-douglass-how-did-he-try-to-persuade-his-readers-and-listeners-to-fight-against-slavery>Who was Frederick Douglass How did he try to persuade his readers and listeners to fight against slavery?</h2>
<p>Frederick Douglass ‘s intended audience was white people, mainly in the north, as he wanted to convince them of the damaging effects of slavery and to convince them that slavery should be abolished. The two prefatory letters in the book, one written by Wendell Phillips and one written by William…</p>
<h2 id=who-was-frederick-douglass-trying-to-persuade>Who was Frederick Douglass trying to persuade?</h2>
<p>Frederick Douglass–Abolitionist Leader. After Douglass escaped, he wanted to promote freedom for all slaves. He published a newspaper in Rochester, New York, called The North Star. It got its name because slaves escaping at night followed the North Star in the sky to freedom.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-frederick-douglass-trying-to-get-his-audience-to-do>What was Frederick Douglass trying to get his audience to do?</h2>
<p>In “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?” Frederick Douglass sought not only to convince people of the wrongfulness of slavery but also to make abolition more acceptable to Northern whites.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-douglass-say-the-longest-days-were-to-mr-covey>What does Douglass say the longest days were to MR Covey?</h2>
<p>Covey? ” The longest days were too short for him, and the shortest nights too long for him.”</p>
<h2 id=who-was-douglass-audience>Who was Douglass audience?</h2>
<p>In the case of Douglass’ narrative, the intended audience was white, intellectual Northerners, whose inaction was a byproduct of cognitive dissonance and whose own self-value would not be threatened by the rise of a black intellectual class.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-when-douglass-tried-to-tell-phillips-his-real-name>What happened when Douglass tried to tell Phillips his real name?</h2>
<p>Phillips says that, some years before, Frederick Douglass had tried to tell him his real name. At that point, Phillips told him not to tell him this information — not his real name, nor where he was born. The reason, it seems, is that Phillips did not want to run the risk of getting Douglass’s relatives in trouble.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-slaves-call-mr-covey-and-why>What did the slaves call Mr Covey and why?</h2>
<p>The slaves call Covey “the snake,” in part because he sneaks through the grass, but also because this nickname is a reference to Satan’s appearance in the form of a snake in the biblical book of Genesis.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-abolition-of-slavery>Who was involved in the abolition of slavery?</h2>
<p>Frederick Douglass and the Abolition of Slavery There were many influential people who fought for the abolition of slavery in the 1800s. Among these people are Harriet Tubman, William Lloyd Garrison, and our sixteenth president, Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-slavery-so-controversial-in-the-1800s>Why was slavery so controversial in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>Slavery, by itself seems very unnatural and entices mixed feelings various different people especially in our country during the 1800s which had been divided into the north and south due to this controversial issue.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-covey-do-to-make-his-slaves-work>What did Covey do to make his slaves work?</h2>
<p>Covey often uses elaborate ruses to trick the slaves into thinking he has disappeared, only to watch his slaves from a hidden vantage point. This forces the slaves to work constantly, from fear of constant surveillance.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jefferson-say-about-the-slave-trade>What did Jefferson say about the slave trade?</h2>
<p>Jefferson also states that it is the King’s fault for the slave trade going on for seven years, he is the one who started it, he blames him (Randall 212). Short further explains that the British are bringing slaves to America without our consent (88).</p>
