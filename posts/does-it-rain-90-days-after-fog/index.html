<h2 id=does-it-rain-90-days-after-fog>Does it rain 90 days after fog?</h2>
<p>Approximately 90 days from a fog you will get some kind of precipitation.</p>
<h2 id=does-fog-indicate-rain>Does fog indicate rain?</h2>
<p>In the summer, the air can only cool enough if the night sky is clear enough that the heat can be radiated into space. If the night is cloudy, the clouds act as a blanket to keep it in. If you see a fog during the summer, it usually means that the next day will be clear. A winter fog for rain.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-old-wives-tale-about-fog>What is the old wives tale about fog?</h2>
<p>One old wives’ tale says that every foggy day during August equates to a day of snowfall during the following winter. Some also use this tale in more general terms, meaning that if there is a lot of fog throughout the month of August, there will be a lot of snow throughout the upcoming winter.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-old-saying-about-fogs-in-august>What is the old saying about fogs in August?</h2>
<p>According to the old folklore, it really can. The saying is, “For every foggy morning in August, it will snow that many days this winter.” The Mississippi River bottom in August will produce fog, but that does not always extend up the bluff and outside the wide floodplain.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-predict-fog>Can you predict fog?</h2>
<p>Whether driving or flying, fog results in travel delays and in some cases cancellations. Forecasting fog can be difficult, but its proper prediction is extremely important. The proper prediction of fog can have people better prepared to avoid delays and being late for work.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-fog-signify>What does fog signify?</h2>
<p>Fog illustrates obscurity, indistinction; in the Bible, it is an image preceding great revelations. It is the “GRAY zone” between reality and unreality, and uncertainty about the future and beyond. According to Browning it can represent approaching death.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-fog-in-winter-mean>What does fog in winter mean?</h2>
<p>In addition to snow and cold temperatures, fog is another common occurrence during the cool season. To get fog, a sufficient amount of water vapor near the ground and temperatures cool enough to condense that water into droplets are needed.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-foggy-days-in-august-mean>What do foggy days in August mean?</h2>
<p>snowfall<br>
According to folklore, “For every fog in August, there will be a snowfall.” The first full week of August is NOW behind us and snow lovers may want to put some “stock” into this little bit of folklore: “If the first week in August is unusually warm, the coming winter will be snowy and long.”</p>
<h2 id=how-many-fogs-have-we-had-in-august>How many fogs have we had in August?</h2>
<p>Total Cloudy and Foggy Days at US Cities in August</p>
<table><tr><th>City</th><th>Cloud</th><th>Fog</th></tr><tr><td>Jacksonville, Florida</td><td>11</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Kansas City, Missouri</td><td>8</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Las Vegas, Nevada</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Los Angeles, California</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-often-does-it-rain-one-hundred-days-after-fog>How often does it rain one hundred days after fog?</h2>
<p>One hundred days after fog, snow was reported 10 times and rain 20 times. In general, it rained 30 percent of the time on day 90 and 27 percent of the time on day one hundred. Snow is a little harder to come by, only eight percent of the time 90 days out from fog but it increases to 14 percent by day 100.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-90-days-after-a-fog-mean>What does 90 days after a fog mean?</h2>
<p>Back to the 90 day thing…it seems like just about every time we get major precipitation, Bill reminds me that 90 days prior, we had a dense fog. Maybe it is an old wives’ tale.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-predict-when-morning-fog-will-occur>Is it possible to predict when morning fog will occur?</h2>
<p>It goes on to discuss how temperature, atmospheric pressure and moisture are related to weather patterns and how to predict what different land (or water) masses will impact winds and weather in the area. Fog is very pretty to photograph—deadly for VFR. – Stan Mar 21 ’18 at 14:04</p>
<h2 id=is-the-fog-still-there-on-january-19th>Is the fog still there on January 19th?</h2>
<p>Today (January 19th) the fog wasn’t quite as dense, but it still had a definite presence. On both days, when stopping at an intersection, I had to “roll” the car windows down to listen for traffic before proceeding through the intersection.</p>
