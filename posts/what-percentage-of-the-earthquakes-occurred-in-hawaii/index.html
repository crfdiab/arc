<p>Hawaii is the #1 state where you are most likely to experience an earthquake</p>

<h2 id=how-many-earthquakes-happen-in-hawaii-today>How many earthquakes happen in Hawaii today?</h2>
<p>today: 2.2 in Volcano, Hawaii, United States. this week: 3.1 in Pāhala, Hawaii, United States. this month: 3.4 in Volcano, Hawaii, United States. this year: 5.2 in Honoka’a, Hawaii, United States.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-earthquake-on-the-big-island-of-hawaii>When was the last earthquake on the Big Island of Hawaii?</h2>
<p>April 2019<br>
The last time the Big Island had a magnitude 5 earthquake or greater was in April 2019 on the east side of the island, said USGS geophysicist Jefferson Chang.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-alot-of-earthquakes-in-hawaii>Are there alot of earthquakes in Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Thousands of earthquakes occur every year in the State of Hawaii. They are caused by eruptive processes within the active volcanoes or by deep structural adjustments due to the weight of the islands on Earth’s underlying crust. Some are strong enough to be felt on one or more of the islands.</p>
<h2 id=will-kilauea-erupt-again>Will Kilauea erupt again?</h2>
<p>Activity Summary: Kīlauea volcano is not currently erupting. No surface activity has been observed by field crews or in webcam images since May 23, 2021. Low rates of ground deformation and modest rates of seismicity continue across the volcano.</p>
<h2 id=is-moving-to-hawaii-realistic>Is moving to Hawaii realistic?</h2>
<p>Your move is an exciting and fun time, but it should also be one that’s done with caution and realistic expectations, or else you may be one of the hundreds who move back to the mainland each year. Hawaii is paradise for many reasons, but it’s also a difficult place to live for most because of the economy.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-earthquakes-have-there-been-on-oahu>How many earthquakes have there been on Oahu?</h2>
<p>According to the 1986 catalog “Earthquakes felt on Oahu, Hawaii, and their intensities,” by Doak Cox, University of Hawaii Environmental Center, August 1986. The compilation lists 113 felt and reported earthquakes from 1859 to 1986; so there were between one and two reported events a year.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-earthquake-in-hawaii-in-2018>Where was the earthquake in Hawaii in 2018?</h2>
<p>On May 4, 2018, an earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 6.9 struck Hawaii island in the Hawaii archipelago at around 12:33 p.m. local time. The earthquake’s epicenter was near the south flank of Kīlauea, which has been the site of seismic and volcanic activity since late April. According to the United States Geological Survey…</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-earthquake-in-hawaii-in-1868>How big was the earthquake in Hawaii in 1868?</h2>
<p>1868 Hawaii earthquake. The 1868 Hawaii earthquake was the largest recorded in the history of Hawaiʻi island, with an estimated magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter magnitude scale and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). The earthquake occurred at 4 p.m. local time on April 2, 1868 and caused a landslide and tsunami that led to 77 deaths.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-epicenter-of-the-hawaii-earthquake>Where was the epicenter of the Hawaii earthquake?</h2>
<p>The earthquake’s epicenter was near the south flank of Kīlauea, which has been the site of seismic and volcanic activity since late April. According to the United States Geological Survey the quake was related to the new lava outbreaks at the volcano, and it resulted in the Hilina Slump moving about two feet.</p>
