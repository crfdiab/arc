<h2 id=is-there-a-magnetic-south-pole>Is there a magnetic south pole?</h2>
<p>The south magnetic pole is the point on the Earth’s surface where the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field is vertically upwards. The magnetic dip (the angle between the horizontal plane and the Earth’s magnetic field lines) is 90° at the magnetic poles. The south magnetic pole is not fixed.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-magnetic-field-come-out-of-the-north-or-south-pole>Does the magnetic field come out of the north or south pole?</h2>
<p>Magnetic field lines outside of a permanent magnet always run from the north magnetic pole to the south magnetic pole. Therefore, the magnetic field lines of the earth run from the southern geographic hemisphere towards the northern geographic hemisphere.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-magnetic-field-at-the-poles>Is there a magnetic field at the poles?</h2>
<p>The magnetic field lines travel from the north pole of the magnet, looping back around to go back in toward the south pole. At each pole, the magnetic field lines are nearly vertical.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-magnetic-place-on-earth>What is the most magnetic place on Earth?</h2>
<p>south magnetic pole<br>
The south magnetic pole intersects the Earth at 78.3 S latitude and 142 E longitude. This places the south magnetic pole in Antarctica. The magnetic poles are also where the magnetic fields are the strongest.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-near-the-geographic-north-pole-a-magnetic-north>What is near the geographic North Pole, a magnetic north?</h2>
<p>The magnetic field created by the molten core of the earth must have a magnetic South pole near the geographic north pole in order to attract the “N” end of our bar magnet and compass needles. This South magnetic pole near the geographic north pole is sometimes called the magnetic north pole, even though it really isn’t.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-south-pole-called-the-north-pole>Why is the south pole called the North Pole?</h2>
<p>Therefore: The magnetic field created by the molten core of the earth must have a magnetic South pole near the geographic north pole in order to attract the “N” end of our bar magnet and compass needles. This South magnetic pole near the geographic north pole is sometimes called the magnetic north pole, even though it really isn’t.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-magnetic-field-of-a-magnet-pure-dipole>Is the magnetic field of a magnet pure dipole?</h2>
<p>Physically, however, this is not correct, because the magnetic field of a permanent magnet is a pure dipole field. This means there are no magnetic charges (electrons) that could be understood as a single pole, but only magnets with a north and a south pole.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-the-earths-magnetic-pole-move>How often does the earth’s magnetic pole move?</h2>
<p>We already know that the magnetic pole moves. Both poles have wandered ever since the Earth existed. In fact, the poles even flip over, with north becoming south and south becoming north. These magnetic reversals have occurred throughout history, every 450,000 years or so on average.</p>
