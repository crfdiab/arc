<h2 id=how-do-you-say-great-great-uncle>How do you say great great-uncle?</h2>
<p>As you noted, the proper term for your relationship to your brother’s grandchildren is grandaunt, just like grandparent….</p>
<table><tr><th>parent</th><th>aunt/uncle</th></tr><tr><td>great-grandparent</td><td>great-grandaunt/great-granduncle</td></tr><tr><td>great-great-grandparent</td><td>great-great-grandaunt/great-great-granduncle</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-do-japanese-call-uncle>What do Japanese call uncle?</h2>
<p>Oji<br>
Oji – “Uncle”</p>
<h2 id=what-do-japanese-call-their-great-grandparents>What do Japanese call their great grandparents?</h2>
<p>Variant spellings include obaachan, oba-chan, obachan and baachan. One’s own grandmother is called sobo or soba. Some Japanese children call their grandparents by the nicknames Jiji (from ojiisan) and Baba (from obaasan).</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-your-family-members-in-japanese>What do you call your family members in Japanese?</h2>
<p>In Japanese, “family” is called 家族 kazoku (or ご家族 gokazoku to speak about the family of a higher social rank interlocutor).</p>
<h2 id=is-an-uncle-an-ancestor>Is an uncle an ancestor?</h2>
<p>The definition of ancestor is someone from whom you are descended, so that means parents, grandparents, and going up from there. An uncle is not an ancestor, nor is a cousin. (unless they are also a parent or grandparent). They would be relatives.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-great-uncle>What makes a great uncle?</h2>
<p>The qualities of a good uncle include someone who is laid back and brings a sense of fun into a child’s life, showing them what it means to be part of a loving, caring relationship. We know that children benefit from interactions with positive male role models.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-rude-to-call-someone-uncle>Is it rude to call someone uncle?</h2>
<p>Here is the simple answer: If the person is your uncle (i.e., a brother of one of your parents), then it’s not rude to address them an uncle. If the person is your grandpa (i.e., the father of one of your parents), it’s not rude to address them as grandpa.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-call-people-uncle>Why do we call people uncle?</h2>
<p>In Latin, the word is “avunculus”, the diminutive form of “avus” (grandfather). Hence an uncle is a “little grandfather.” I suppose that calling a paternalistic figure or family friend “uncle” is a way to say that the person exhibits characteristics that are recognized as “grandfatherly.”</p>
<h2 id=is-ojisan-rude>Is Ojisan rude?</h2>
<p>Ojisan is used to address older guy so Niisan is a bit more considerate compared to Ojisan. Both pronouns are in the casual side. Calling an older guy Ojisan sounds childish, I have to add. But it’s okay if you are a friendly dude and usually talk very casually.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-your-great-uncle-related-to-you>How is your great uncle related to you?</h2>
<p>Degree of relation: how far you are from that person in your family tree. So, your great uncle is 12.5% related to you and 4 steps removed from you in your family tree.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-someones-japanese-family-member>What do you call someone’s Japanese family member?</h2>
<p>Someone’s Japanese Family Members. The following is the word list for someone’s Japanese family members. Kanji. Hiragana or. Katakana. Romaji. Meaning. 1. ご家族.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-a-younger-brother-in-japanese>What do you call a younger brother in Japanese?</h2>
<p>Younger Brother To say younger brother in Japanese: otouto 弟; The term otoutosan 弟さん is used when talking about the otouto of someone else. Eldest Brother An older brother is just any of your brothers older than you. The eldest brother is specifically called: choukei 長兄 (see eldest child for explanation) Youngest Brother</p>
