<h2 id=what-is-the-policy-that-called-for-resisting-the-spread-of-soviet-power-and-influence>What is the policy that called for resisting the spread of Soviet power and influence?</h2>
<p>Overview. In 1947, President Harry S. Truman pledged that the United States would help any nation resist communism in order to prevent its spread. His policy of containment is known as the Truman Doctrine.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-containment-policy-cold-war>What was the containment policy Cold War?</h2>
<p>Containment was a United States policy using numerous strategies to prevent the spread of communism abroad. A component of the Cold War, this policy was a response to a series of moves by the Soviet Union to enlarge its communist sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, China, Korea, and Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-given-to-the-political-tension-between-the-us-and-the-soviet-union>What was the name given to the political tension between the US and the Soviet Union?</h2>
<p>The Cold War was an ongoing political rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies that developed after World War II. This hostility between the two superpowers was first given its name by George Orwell in an article published in 1945.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-us-response-to-the-soviet-expansion>What was the US response to the Soviet expansion?</h2>
<p>It was clear that Truman was referring to countries resisting an armed communist takeover, but it was not spelt out in such straightforward terms and so gave the US government opportunity for interpretation. America was now committed to a policy of containment, or stopping the spread of communism.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-russia-become-a-great-power-in-the-cold-war>How did Russia become a great power in the Cold War?</h2>
<p>Russia, in the guise of the U.S.S.R., had become a great power and by the 1970s was one of two world superpowers. The advent of the Cold War in the 1940s led to Stalin tightening his grip on his sphere of influence in eastern and southeastern Europe. Russian was imposed as the main foreign language, and Russian economic experience was copied.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-us-policy-in-the-soviet-union-in-1947>What was the US policy in the Soviet Union in 1947?</h2>
<p>Kennan’s influential 1947 “X” article advocated a policy of containment towards the Soviet Union. It described containment as “a policy of calculated and gradual coercion” and called for significant peacetime military spending, in which the U.S. possessed “superior overall power in dependable combination with other like-minded nations.”</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-the-soviet-union-between-1927-and-1953>What was the history of the Soviet Union between 1927 and 1953?</h2>
<p>Gorbachev The history of the Soviet Union between 1927 and 1953 covers the period in Soviet history from the establishment of Stalinism through victory in the Second World War and down to the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953.</p>
