<h2 id=what-was-robert-clive-known-for>What was Robert Clive known for?</h2>
<p>A courageous, resourceful and ruthless military commander, Major-General Robert Clive helped secure an Indian empire for Britain. He eventually became an imperial statesman, but also a greedy speculator who used his political and military influence to amass a fortune.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-robert-clive-in-the-battle-of-plassey>What was the role of Robert Clive in the Battle of Plassey?</h2>
<p>Robert Clive bribed Mir Jafar, the commander-in-chief of the Nawab’s army, and also promised to make him Nawab of Bengal. Clive defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah at Plassey in 1757 and captured Calcutta. The battle was preceded by an attack on British-controlled Calcutta by Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah and the Black Hole massacre.</p>

<p>the British East India Company<br>
Victory for the British East India Company in the Battle of Plassey was the start of nearly two centuries of British rule in India. For an event with such momentous consequences, it was a surprisingly unimpressive military encounter, the defeat of the Nawab of Bengal owing much to betrayal.</p>

<p>Warren Hastings<br>
Warren Hastings, (born December 6, 1732, Churchill, near Daylesford, Oxfordshire, England—died August 22, 1818, Daylesford), the first and most famous of the British governors-general of India, who dominated Indian affairs from 1772 to 1785 and was impeached (though acquitted) on his return to England.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-clive-bad>Why was Clive bad?</h2>
<p>Leading historians view Robert Clive as unworthy of celebration since his reputation falls far short of the values demanded of public office and because his administrative failures led to the catastrophic Bengal famine of 1769–1773. He has been described as the ‘worst corporate figure in British history’.</p>
<h2 id=why-robert-clive-is-known-as-the-lord-of-plassey>Why Robert Clive is known as the Lord of Plassey?</h2>
<p>He had snatched the richest province of India out of the hands of his political superiors and with the authority of the Mughal regime. Returning to England in February 1760, he was given an Irish peerage as Baron Clive of Plassey in 1762 and was knighted in 1764.</p>
