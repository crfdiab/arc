<h2 id=do-flatfish-live-in-the-ocean>Do flatfish live in the ocean?</h2>
<p>What is a flatfish? Flatfish are exactly what they sound like: fish with thin, oval or diamond-shaped bodies that are lie flat on the seafloor. There are 822 known species in 16 families, and they reside in oceans, estuaries, and freshwater environments in nearly every part of the globe.</p>
<h2 id=are-flat-fish-predators>Are flat fish predators?</h2>
<p>Flatfish can hide from predators by burrowing, leaving only their eyes above the surface. In addition the habitat is home to an abundance of prey such as worms and shrimp. With both eyes on the upper side they can use 3D vision to hunt and detect predators.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-flat-fish-in-the-ocean>What is a flat fish in the ocean?</h2>
<p>A flatfish is a member of the ray-finned demersal fish order Pleuronectiformes, also called the Heterosomata, sometimes classified as a suborder of Perciformes. In many species, both eyes lie on one side of the head, one or the other migrating through or around the head during development.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-flounders-predators>What are flounders predators?</h2>
<p>Young flounders are fed upon by crabs, shrimps, and other fish while juvenile and adult flounder fall prey to many predatory fishes including cod, sculpin, striped bass, bluefish, cobia, groupers, moray eels, skates, stingrays, and sharks.</p>
<h2 id=are-fish-actually-smart>Are fish actually smart?</h2>
<p>“Fish are more intelligent than they appear. In many areas, such as memory, their cognitive powers match or exceed those of ‘higher’ vertebrates including non-human primates.” Fish’s long-term memories help them keep track of complex social relationships.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-you-tell-if-a-fish-is-flat>How can you tell if a fish is flat?</h2>
<p>Flat fish are members of the order Pleuronectiformes of ray-finned demersal fish, or ‘Heterosomata’. Many flat fish have both eyes on one side of their head. Some have the left side of their face upwards whilst others have the right, or can face either side.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-flounders-live-for>How long do flounders live for?</h2>
<p>Males seldom exceed 16 inches in length. Southern flounders reach maturity at an age of about two years, though the age at maturity is reported to vary with location along the Gulf coast. Female southern flounders live for about seven years, while almost no males live past three years old.</p>
<h2 id=are-flounders-poisonous>Are flounders poisonous?</h2>
<p>Flounder is healthy. Above all, beware of taking high doses of flounder, just like any other fish like catfish, salmon, crab, and tilapia; flounder contain some mercury, which may harm pregnant women and children at their tender age if they are taken in high dosages.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-a-flatfish-live-in-the-sea>Where does a flatfish live in the sea?</h2>
<p>Most flatfish live on or near the seabed, where they hunt for small water animals and other fish. When a flatfish swims, it glides down to land on the bottom, where it flaps its fins to brush up mud and sand.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-flatfish-have-one-eye-on-the-sea-bottom>Why did flatfish have one eye on the sea bottom?</h2>
<p>…bony fish as a rule have a marked tendency to be flattened in a vertical direction…. It was natural, therefore, that when the ancestors of [flatfish] took to the sea bottom, they should have lain on one side …. But this raised the problem that one eye was always looking down into the sand and was effectively useless.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-species-of-flatfish-are-there-in-the-world>How many species of flatfish are there in the world?</h2>
<p>Many important food fish are in this order, including the flounders, soles, turbot, plaice, and halibut. Some flatfish can camouflage themselves on the ocean floor. Over 800 described species are placed into 16 families.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fish-can-you-eat-in-the-ocean>What kind of fish can you eat in the ocean?</h2>
<p>Sea Bream. Sea bream is the other types of ocean fish to eat. It has another name called as Sparidae and porgies. There are about 155 different species of this fish. If most fish or animal will be a delicacy by using its flesh but this species of fish will mostly being served as delicacy not the flesh but the head especially the cheeks.</p>
