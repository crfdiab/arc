<h2 id=does-the-us-trade-with-south-africa>Does the US trade with South Africa?</h2>
<p>U.S.-South Africa Trade Facts South Africa is currently our 39th largest goods trading partner with $13.2 billion in total (two way) goods trade during 2019. Goods exports totaled $5.4 billion; goods imports totaled $7.8 billion. The U.S. goods trade deficit with South Africa was $2.4 billion in 2019.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-us-support-south-africa>Did the US support South Africa?</h2>
<p>The United States has maintained an official presence in South Africa since 1799, when an American consulate was opened in Cape Town. The U.S. Embassy is located in Pretoria, and Consulates General are in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-us-support-south-african-apartheid>Did the US support South African apartheid?</h2>
<p>The United States began an anti-apartheid movement. However, the United States involvement was not all positive as it brought more political turmoil. So, though they made it seem as though their main goal was to end apartheid, in fact the main concern was their business role in South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-the-united-states-trade-with-south-africa>How much does the United States trade with South Africa?</h2>
<p>South Africa is the largest U.S. trade partner in Africa, with a total two-way goods trade of $14 billion in 2018. Approximately 600 U.S. businesses operate in South Africa, many of which use South Africa as regional headquarters.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-foreign-trade-change-in-south-africa>How did foreign trade change in South Africa?</h2>
<p>Since the end of apartheid foreign trade in South Africa has increased, following the lifting of several sanctions and boycotts which were imposed as a means of ending apartheid.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-a-trade-surplus-in-south-africa>Why is there a trade surplus in South Africa?</h2>
<p>The data shows some of the initial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, mainly driven by shutdowns in some of the major economies and South Africa’s main trading partners which led to a decline in imports and a consequent trade surplus three times the trade surplus for March 2019.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-apartheid-affect-trade-in-south-africa>How did apartheid affect trade in South Africa?</h2>
<p>During apartheid, South Africa’s foreign trade and investment were affected by sanctions and boycotts by other countries ideologically opposed to apartheid.</p>
