<h2 id=what-did-the-british-empire-gain-from-hong-kong>What did the British empire gain from Hong Kong?</h2>
<p>Over the next half-century, the United Kingdom gained control over all three main regions of Hong Kong: After Hong Kong Island came the Kowloon Peninsula, and finally the New Territories, a swath of land that comprises the bulk of Hong Kong today.</p>
<h2 id=what-resources-did-britain-want-from-china>What resources did Britain want from China?</h2>
<p>The primary motive of British imperialism in China in the nineteenth century was economic. There was a high demand for Chinese tea, silk and porcelain in the British market. However, Britain did not possess sufficient silver to trade with the Qing Empire.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-hong-kong-important-to-the-uk>Why is Hong Kong important to the UK?</h2>
<p>Trade and investment Hong Kong remains the springboard to the Greater China market. UK exported more than £5 billion in goods a 20.5% increase on the previous year from 2011, making Hong Kong the UK’s 13th largest export destination and its third biggest in Asia Pacific, after China and India.</p>
<h2 id=what-natural-resources-does-hong-kong-have>What natural resources does Hong Kong have?</h2>
<p>The natural resources of Hong Kong can be divided into three main categories: metalliferous minerals and non-metalliferous industrial minerals in the onshore area, quarried rock and building stone and offshore sand deposits.</p>
<h2 id=can-hong-kongers-move-to-uk>Can Hong Kongers move to UK?</h2>
<p>The national security law cut that time short, prompting the British government to allow nearly three million people from Hong Kong to live and work in Britain through the special visa program. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described it as one of the biggest changes in visa regulations in British history.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-uk-take-hong-kong-from-china>Why did the UK take Hong Kong from China?</h2>
<p>The UK held virtually all of Hong Kong under a treaty that had leased the territory from China to Britain for a period of 99 years.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-natural-resources-does-hong-kong-have>What kind of Natural Resources does Hong Kong have?</h2>
<p>Hong Kong has little land which is considered arable and has comparatively few natural resources and therefore imports most of its food items. Hong Kong imports about 90% of food supplies which includes items like rice and meat.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-british-influence-society-in-hong-kong>How did the British influence society in Hong Kong?</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the language of English and British culture highly impacted the society of Hong Kong and Southern China for over a century. This Research Guide is divided into four main components. The first section is devoted to the definitions and qualifications of imperialism.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-hong-kong-contribute-to-the-chinese-economy>How did Hong Kong contribute to the Chinese economy?</h2>
<p>So, too, would they learn that emigrants who returned to China from Australia, North America, or Southeast Asia almost always came through Hong Kong, as did remittances from overseas Chinese. And that Hong Kong investors were greatly responsible for China’s dramatic economic transformation in the late 1970s.</p>
