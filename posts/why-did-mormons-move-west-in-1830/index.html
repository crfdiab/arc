<h2 id=why-did-mormons-move-west-in-1830>Why did Mormons move west in 1830?</h2>
<p>The Mormons, as they were commonly known, had moved west to escape religious discrimination. After the murder of founder and prophet Joseph Smith, they knew they had to leave their old settlement in Illinois. Many Mormons died in the cold, harsh winter months as they made their way over the Rocky Mountains to Utah.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-mormons-migration-west>What was the purpose of the Mormons migration west?</h2>
<p>The final push and ultimate goal of the Mormon emigrants was the Salt Lake Valley. It signified the end for many of more than a year-long journey across harsh plains. For Mormons it became a protected place where they could live in peace, and build their temple.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-mormons-migrate-from-in-1830>Where did Mormons migrate from in 1830?</h2>
<p>Their leader assassinated and their homes under attack, the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormons) of Nauvoo, Illinois, begin a long westward migration that eventually brings them to the valley of the Great Salt Lake in Utah.</p>
<h2 id=which-mormon-led-the-trek-west>Which Mormon led the trek west?</h2>
<p>Brigham Young<br>
Trek of 1846 The departure from Nauvoo began on February 4, 1846, under the leadership of Brigham Young. This early departure exposed them to the elements in the worst of winter. After crossing the Mississippi River, the journey across Iowa Territory followed primitive territorial roads and Native American trails.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-mormon-trail-end>Where did the Mormon Trail end?</h2>
<p>Great Salt Lake<br>
The Mormon Trail broke south just to the west of the Continental Divide, and it terminated to the southeast of the Great Salt Lake, in what is today Salt Lake City.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-mormons-move-to-the-west>Why did the Mormons move to the west?</h2>
<p>The short answer is that the Mormons kept moving in an attempt to find somewhere they could live in peace. From the very moment that Joseph revealed he had seen God, persecution against the Saints was almost incessant and became, at times, unbearable.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-mormons-live-in-the-1830s>Where did the Mormons live in the 1830s?</h2>
<p>For most of the 1830s, Smith lived with the majority of his church members in Kirtland, Ohio. Growing in numbers, Smith sent followers to Jackson County, Missouri, in an attempt to establish a City of Zion as the biblical New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-tension-between-the-mormons-and-the-early-settlers>Why was there tension between the Mormons and the early settlers?</h2>
<p>Tensions built up between the rapidly growing Mormon community and the earlier settlers for a number of reasons: They believed—after a revelation recorded on June 6, 1831—that if they were righteous they would inherit the land held by others (“which is now the land of your enemies”) in Missouri.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-mormons-get-to-fort-kearny>How did the Mormons get to Fort Kearny?</h2>
<p>While the Platte River was the main Mormon Trail to Fort Kearny, Nebraska, second in importance was their use of the original trail from Independence to Fort Kearny, especially by the thousands of Mormons who emigrated from England, and by boats via New Orleans and St. Louis to Independence, or by rail via New York.</p>
