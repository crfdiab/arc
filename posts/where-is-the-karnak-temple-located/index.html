<p>Thebes<br>
Karnak is an ancient Egyptian temple precinct located on the east bank of the Nile River in Thebes (modern-day Luxor). It covers more than 100 hectares, an area larger than some ancient cities.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-karnak-temple>What was the purpose of the Karnak Temple?</h2>
<p>The Karnak Temple dates back from around 2055 BC to around 100 AD. It was built as a cult temple and was dedicated to the gods Amun, Mut, and khonsu. Being the largest building for religious purposes ever to be constructed, the Karnak Temple was known as “most select of places” by ancient Egyptians.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-there-temples-in-pyramids>Why were there temples in pyramids?</h2>
<p>Egyptian temples were built for the official worship of the gods and in commemoration of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt and regions under Egyptian control. Temples were seen as houses for the gods or kings to whom they were dedicated.</p>

<p>Image Credit: @desiree_resenterra Karnak is the ancient site of a temple built in honour of Amun, Mut and Khonsu, at Thebes (now Luxor), Egypt. The complex consists of three main temples and many smaller temples. The word Karnak, comes from the Arabic “Khurnak”, which means “fortified village”.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-amun-re-temple-in-karnak>How big is the Amun Re temple in Karnak?</h2>
<p>Karnak Temple’s size is so huge. It’s considered the largest religious building ever built, covering 60 feddans (144000 square meters). For instance, it’s not only one temple. Three main temples are existing in this area; that’s why it’s called the complex of Karnak or the temples of Karnak, dedicated to Amun-Ra or Amun-Re, Mut, and Montu.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-only-part-of-karnak-open-to-the-public>Which is the only part of Karnak open to the public?</h2>
<p>The term Karnak often is understood as being the Precinct of Amun-Re only, because this is the only part most visitors see. The three other parts, the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Montu, and the dismantled Temple of Amenhotep IV, are closed to the public.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-hatshepsut-do-for-the-karnak-temple>What did Hatshepsut do for the Karnak Temple?</h2>
<p>One of the most prolific pharaohs during the glory days of Karnak was a woman named Hatshepsut, known for constructing one of the most amazing temples of Ancient Egypt which was named after her. Her main contribution was the restoration of the Precinct of Mut, which was dedicated to the ancient great goddess of Egypt.</p>
