<h2 id=is-a-bronze-star-a-big-deal>Is a bronze star a big deal?</h2>
<p>Today, it is the fourth-highest ranking award a service member can receive for a heroic and meritorious deed performed in an armed conflict. For those who receive the BSM, it is a signal of their sacrifice, bravery and honor while serving their country.</p>
<h2 id=has-anyone-won-2-medal-honors>Has anyone won 2 medal honors?</h2>
<p>To date, the maximum number of Medals of Honor earned by any service member has been two. The last living individual to be awarded two Medals of Honor was John J. Kelly 3 Oct 1918; the last individual to receive two Medals of Honor for two different actions was Smedley Butler, in 1914 and 1915.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-highest-award-in-the-military>Which is the highest award in the military?</h2>
<p>The Congressional Medal of Honor The Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest military honor presented for valor. It is also the only military award that is congressionally approved for presentation by the President.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-highest-military-medal-for-bravery>Which is the highest military medal for bravery?</h2>
<p>The five highest-ranking military medals for bravery in combat include the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), the Navy Cross, the Air Force Cross and the Silver Star Medal. According to The Institute of Heraldry, these awards are also referred to as “decorations”…</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-second-highest-medal-in-the-military>Which is the second highest medal in the military?</h2>
<p>The actions of the awardee must be of such a high degree that they are above all other combat decorations, yet do not merit the awarding of the Congressional Medal of Honor. The Distinguished Service Cross (Army), the Navy Cross (Navy), and the Air Force Cross (Air Force) are ranked as the second highest award for valor.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-medals-awarded-in-the-us-military>How are medals awarded in the US military?</h2>

They are listed in order of their precedence, with the most distinguished awards at the top of the order.
