<p>In Florida, Andrew killed 44 and left a record $25 billion in damage. Prior to making landfall in Louisiana on August 26, Andrew caused extensive damage to oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to $500 million in losses for oil companies….Impact.</p>

<h2 id=how-was-hurricane-andrew-born>How was Hurricane Andrew born?</h2>
<p>Synoptic History. Satellite pictures and upper-air data indicate that Hurricane Andrew formed from a tropical wave that crossed from the west coast of Africa to the tropical North Atlantic Ocean on 14 August 1992. The depression was initially embedded in an environment of easterly vertical wind shear.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hurricane-andrew-come-through>When did Hurricane Andrew come through?</h2>
<p>Aug. 24, 1992<br>
Hurricane Andrew and its ferocious gusts blew through Miami-Dade County just before 5 a.m. Aug. 24, 1992. The storm was one of the most intense to make landfall in the U.S. and, for many years, was the costliest natural disaster.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hurricane-andrew-come>When did Hurricane Andrew come?</h2>
<p>Hurricane Andrew began as a tropical wave that crossed the west coast of Africa into the tropical North Atlantic on August 14, 1992.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hurricane-andrew-hit-dade-county-florida>When did Hurricane Andrew hit Dade County Florida?</h2>
<p>On August 21, 1992, winds causing the vertical shear suddenly moved north, and Andrew quickly grew from a tropical storm to a Category three hurricane in the span of three days. The powerful hurricane hit Dade County, Florida on August 24 as a Category four storm.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-hurricane-andrew-make-landfall-in-louisiana>Where did Hurricane Andrew make landfall in Louisiana?</h2>
<p>At 08:30 UTC on August 26, the cyclone made landfall about 20 mi (30 km) west-southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Andrew weakened rapidly as it turned to the north and northeast, falling to tropical storm intensity within 10 hours.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-hurricane-pressure-during-hurricane-andrew>What was the hurricane pressure during Hurricane Andrew?</h2>
<p>On August 19, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the storm failed to locate a well-defined center, and the next day a flight found that the cyclone had degenerated to the extent that only a diffuse low-level circulation center remained; observations indicated the pressure rose to an unusually high 1015 mbar.</p>
