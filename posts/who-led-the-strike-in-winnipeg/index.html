<h2 id=who-led-the-strike-in-winnipeg>Who led the strike in Winnipeg?</h2>
<p>J.S. Woodsworth, a strike leader who was sentenced to one year in jail, eventually went on to found the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which was the forerunner of the New Democratic Party. Almost three decades passed before Canadian workers secured union recognition and collective bargaining.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-represented-in-the-citizens-committee-of-1000>Who was represented in the Citizens Committee of 1000?</h2>
<p>The Citizens’ Committee of One Thousand, which included Winnipeg’s politicians, manufacturers, and bankers, believed the same thing. In their view, the placards became a symbol of the breakdown of public authority.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-winnipeg-general-strike>What was the result of the Winnipeg General Strike?</h2>
<p>Between 15 May and 25 June 1919, more than 30,000 workers left their jobs (see Work). Factories, shops, transit and city services shut down. The strike resulted in arrests, injuries and the deaths of two protestors. It did not immediately succeed in empowering workers and improving job conditions.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-general-strike-illegal>Is a general strike illegal?</h2>
<p>Under the anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act, “a general strike in support of other workers is illegal,” making general strikes effectively barred. In addition to these possible legal hurdles, organizing a general strike would require collective action that is difficult under current organizing rules.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-outcomes-of-the-winnipeg-general-strike>What were the outcomes of the Winnipeg General Strike?</h2>
<h2 id=who-are-the-leaders-of-the-winnipeg-general-strike>Who are the leaders of the Winnipeg General Strike?</h2>
<p>Arrested strike leaders at the Vaughan Street Jail in Winnipeg, 1920. Back row from left to right: Roger E. Bray, George Armstrong, Alderman John Queen, R.B. Russell, R.J. Johns and Bill Pritchard. Front row from left to right: Reverend William Ivens and Alderman A.A. Heaps.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-general-strike-in-canada-in-1919>Where was the general strike in Canada in 1919?</h2>
<p>Without wanting to diminish the centrality or the drama of the Winnipeg strike, Winnipeg was hardly alone. At least 20 cities in Canada from Victoria to Amherst, Nova Scotia, experienced general or near general strikes in 1919.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-famous-strike-in-canada>What was the most famous strike in Canada?</h2>
<p>The Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 was one of the most famous and influential strikes in Canadian history.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-special-police-in-winnipeg-in-1919>Who was the special police in Winnipeg in 1919?</h2>
<p>The Special Police tended to be returned war veterans who were against the strike. They wore armbands and badges as identification and were armed with clubs. Their appearance on the streets of Winnipeg created a new tension. “Special Police” on the march in downtown Winnipeg, June 10, 1919.</p>
