<h2 id=what-is-the-idea-behind-the-term-the-imperial-presidency>What is the idea behind the term the imperial presidency?</h2>
<p>According to Professor of political science Thomas E. Cronin, author of The State of the Presidency, the Imperial Presidency is a term used to define a danger to the American constitutional system by allowing the Presidency to create and abuse presidential prerogative during national emergencies.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-presidents-power-is-almost-unlimited-why>Which of the president’s power is almost unlimited Why?</h2>
<p>Which of the President’s powers is almost unlimited? His power as commander-in-chief is the most unlimited. What is the difference between a treaty and an executive agreement? A treaty is an agreement that goes through the Senate, and requires two-thirds vote.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-the-president-recognizes-another-country>What does it mean when the president recognizes another country?</h2>
<p>A treaty is an agreement (contract) between countries. The president has the power to “recognize” the government of another country.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-presidents-recognition-power>What is the President’s recognition power?</h2>
<p>The president decides whether to recognize new nations and new governments, and negotiate treaties with other nations, which become binding on the United States when approved by two-thirds of the Senate.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-does-the-us-not-recognize>What country does the US not recognize?</h2>
<p>As of 2019, the US does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, Bhutan, Syria, and Iran. While the US does have relations with Kosovo and the Holy See, they do not recognize Palestine or Western Sahara as countries, and therefore have no relations with either state.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-criticisms-of-the-imperial-presidency>Are there any criticisms of the imperial presidency?</h2>
<p>Ever since Schlesinger published his theory in 1973, criticisms of an Imperial Presidency have arisen. The main arguments are that The Executive Office by comparison with the rest of the Federal Bureaucracy is relatively small</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-president-of-the-imperial-presidency>Who was the first president of the imperial presidency?</h2>
<p>While the “imperial presidency” has been discussed as a danger in our country since its founding, it is a term most associated with Nixon. Presidents such as Andrew Jackson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt showed similar tendencies.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-arthur-schlesinger-write-the-imperial-presidency>When did Arthur Schlesinger write the imperial presidency?</h2>
<p>American historian Arthur Schlesinger wrote a book in 1973 titled the Imperial Presidency based upon two concerns he had with the Office of the President. First, that the Office of the President was out of control and second, that the Office had breeched the limits set by the Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-power-is-concentrated-in-the-hands-of-a-president>What happens when power is concentrated in the hands of a president?</h2>
<p>Once power becomes concentrated in the hands of a president, citizens are left only with the assurance that such unchecked power will be used wisely – a Faustian bargain the framers repeatedly warned us never to accept.</p>
