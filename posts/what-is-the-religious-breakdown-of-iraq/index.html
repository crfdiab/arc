<h2 id=what-is-the-religious-breakdown-of-iraq>What is the religious breakdown of Iraq?</h2>
<p>Religion in Iraq is overwhelmingly Muslim, Iraqi Muslims are split into two distinct sects, Shia and Sunni. According to the CIA World Factbook, 95% to 98% of the population are Muslims. The remainder follow Christianity, Yazidism religious syncretism, Mandaeism, Shabakism, and Yarsanism.</p>
<h2 id=does-iraq-have-a-secular-government>Does Iraq have a secular government?</h2>
<p>Iraq became a secular state in 1932 after its independence. However, Islam was instituted as the state religion of Iraq in 2005 following the adoption of a new Iraqi constitution.</p>
<h2 id=do-people-in-iran-have-freedom-of-religion>Do people in Iran have freedom of religion?</h2>
<p>The constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran recognizes Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism as official religions. Article 13 of the Iranian Constitution, recognizes them as People of the Book and they are granted the right to exercise religious freedom in Iran.</p>
<h2 id=does-syria-allow-religious-freedom>Does Syria allow religious freedom?</h2>
<p>The constitution of the Syrian Arab Republic guarantees freedom of religion. Syria has had two constitutions: one passed in 1973, and one in 2012 through the 2012 Syrian constitutional referendum.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-shiites-in-iraq>Who was the leader of the Shiites in Iraq?</h2>
<p>Shiite (or Shia) – roughly means “followers” or “cohorts” of Imam Ali, the Prophet’s cousin, protégé and son-in-law. Shiites believe that Imam Ali (and his sons) should have succeeded the Prophet in running the affairs of the Muslim nation. Imam Ali, the fourth Caliph (successor) moved the Islamic capital from Medina near Mecca to Kufa in Iraq.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-shiites-and-sunnis-in-iraq>Who are the Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq?</h2>
<p>The contemporary conflict between Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq is based not only on a schism that happened almost 14 centuries ago, but on the politics of the Saddam Hussein era.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-majority-of-shiites-in-the-world>Who are the majority of Shiites in the world?</h2>
<p>“We are the sons of Imam Hussein, and the name of Ali is always on our tongues.” Shiites or Shia—the terms are used interchangeably and both mean “partisans”—form one of the two great branches of Islam. About 150 million Shiites are spread around the world, most of them in Iran, Iraq, India and Pakistan.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-history-of-shia-islam-in-iraq>Is there a history of Shia Islam in Iraq?</h2>
<p>Shia Islam has a long history in Iraq. The 4th caliph of Sunni Islam and the 1st Imam of Shia Islam, Ali ibn Abi Talib, moved the capital of the empire from Medina to Kufa/Najaf only two decades after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. Iraq is the site of the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, pilgrimage sites for millions of Shia Muslims.</p>
