<h2 id=how-is-weather-influenced-by-wind>How is weather influenced by wind?</h2>
<p>Wind carries moisture into an atmosphere, as well as hot or cold air into a climate which affects weather patterns. Therefore, a change in wind results in a change of weather. Wind travels from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. Additionally, heat and pressure cause the wind to shift direction.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-winds-influence>How do winds influence?</h2>
<p>Air Currents Prevailing winds bring air from one type of climate to another. For example, warm winds that travel over water tend to collect moisture as they travel; the water vapor in the air will condense as it moves into colder climates, which is why temperate coastal areas often receive heavy rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-wind>What is the purpose of wind?</h2>
<p>Wind energy (or wind power) describes the process by which wind is used to generate electricity. Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power. A generator can convert mechanical power into electricity. Mechanical power can also be utilized directly for specific tasks such as pumping water.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-4-factors-that-determine-weather>What are the 4 factors that determine weather?</h2>
<p>Although many factors combine to influence weather, the four main ones are solar radiation, the amount of which changes with Earth’s tilt, orbital distance from the sun and latitude, temperature, air pressure and the abundance of water.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-global-winds-related-to-weather-patterns>How are global winds related to weather patterns?</h2>
<p>Global winds Earth’s orbit around the sun and its rotation on a tilted axis causes some parts of Earth to receive more solar radiation than others. This uneven heating produces global circulation patterns. offsite link For example, the abundance of energy reaching the equator produces hot humid air that rises high into the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-prevailing-trade-winds-affect-the-climate>How does prevailing trade winds affect the climate?</h2>
<p>In contrast to the temporary effects of daily wind shifts, prevailing trade winds have a direct effect on a region’s climate. Contrasts in temperature create winds. Hot air rises, allowing cooler air to flow underneath. This movement of air from cooler to warmer areas is wind.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-prevailing-winds-form-at-the-equator>Why do prevailing winds form at the equator?</h2>
<p>Because the sun is more intense at the equator, global wind patterns called prevailing winds form. Hotter air at the equator rises and spreads toward the poles. This hotter air is deflected by the rotation of the Earth in a pattern known as the Coriolis effect.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-wind-affect-temperatures-in-the-northeast>How does the wind affect temperatures in the northeast?</h2>
<p>Let’s investigate each of these directions and its affect on temperatures in the Northeast. While shorter daylight hours in the winter help lead to colder temperatures, northerly winds only enhance the frigid feel.</p>
