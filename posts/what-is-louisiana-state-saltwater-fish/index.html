<h2 id=what-is-louisiana-state-saltwater-fish>What is Louisiana State saltwater fish?</h2>
<p>spotted sea trout<br>
Louisiana designated the spotted sea trout (Cynoscion nebulosus) as the official state saltwater fish in 2001. Also called speckled trout, the spotted sea trout is found in the southern United States along the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic ocean.</p>
<h2 id=does-louisiana-have-a-state-fish>Does Louisiana have a state fish?</h2>
<p>The white perch (pomoxis annularis) was designated the official freshwater fish of Louisiana in 1993. Also called sac-au-lait, white crappie, speckled perch, papermouth, goggleeye, silver bass, and bachelor perch, the white perch is a schooling fish in the sunfish family.</p>
<h2 id=are-crappie-called-white-perch>Are crappie called white perch?</h2>
<p>Now, White Crappie may be “called” White Perch by some, as one of many nicknames, but they’re not even in the same fish family. And White Perch are not even an actual “Perch” they’re a Morone, a fish in the temperate bass family (along with White Bass, Yellow Bass, Striped Bass, & Hybrid Striped Bass).</p>
<h2 id=why-are-crappie-called-sacalait>Why are crappie called Sacalait?</h2>
<p>In Louisiana, it is called sacalait (Cajun French: sac-à-lait, lit. ‘milk bag’), seemingly an allusion to its milky white flesh or silvery skin. The supposed French meaning is, however, folk etymology, because the word is ultimately from Choctaw sakli, meaning “trout”.</p>
<h2 id=what-saltwater-fish-are-in-season-in-louisiana>What saltwater fish are in season in Louisiana?</h2>
<p>Visit NOAA Fisheries’ site for federal seasons and regulations for shark, swordfish, and tuna….Reef Fish.</p>
<table><tr><th>Species</th><th>Season</th></tr><tr><td>Greater amberjack</td><td>Opens January 1 Closed season from March 1 through May 31 Reopens June 1 if quota is still available</td></tr><tr><td>Grouper</td><td>Year-round</td></tr><tr><td>Hogfish</td><td>Year-round</td></tr><tr><td>Lesser amberjack</td><td>Year-round</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=can-you-fish-at-night-in-louisiana>Can you fish at night in Louisiana?</h2>
<p>In Louisiana, night fishing exists in some form throughout the state. Although mostly considered a winter sport, it can be done on any cool night. Most people will say that they prefer this method of fishing because the fish bite better in cooler night waters.</p>
<h2 id=are-white-perch-any-good-to-eat>Are white perch any good to eat?</h2>
<p>White Perch and Yellow Perch are two of the most delicious Panfish you’ll find. Delicious as they are, the two species are often a topic of hot discussion among anglers and foodies alike.</p>
<h2 id=is-crappie-and-perch-the-same-fish>Is crappie and perch the same fish?</h2>
<p>Crappie have a taller, more flattened body shape than yellow perch. A crappie also has large dorsal and anal fins. The dorsal and anal fins on a crappie start with six to eight spines depending on the species and end in a large rounded lobe. Crappie have one dorsal fin, while perch have two.</p>
<h2 id=is-crappie-good-eating>Is crappie good eating?</h2>
<p>In short, yes, crappie are delicious. But you’ll want to make sure you handle them properly to be safe and have the best tasting crappie you can get. If you’re in the U.S. then you’re in luck.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-selling-crappie-illegal>Why is selling crappie illegal?</h2>
<p>Crappie is classified as a wild species, which means you can fish or hunt for them. Being illegal in terms of sales, crappie cannot be served in restaurants when they are harvested. This is because while crappie is considered safe to eat, they may have consumed contaminants that are found in unregulated water.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-state-mammal-of-louisiana>What is the state mammal of Louisiana?</h2>
<p>The Louisiana black bear was designated the official state mammal of Louisiana in 1992. The US Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Louisiana black bear as threatened in 1992. Once common, biologists estimate the current population to be only 3-400 animals.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-official-bird-of-the-state-of-louisiana>Which is the official bird of the state of Louisiana?</h2>
<p>The brown pelican is Louisiana’s official bird. Pelicans are famous for their large bill, the lower portion of which has a pouch that can be greatly extended. The state tree is the bald cypress. Its shape, which varies from columnar to conical (bottle-shaped), depends greatly on the amount and duration of flooding in the area.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-amphibians-are-found-in-louisiana>What kind of amphibians are found in Louisiana?</h2>
<p>The American green tree frog was designated the official state amphibian of Louisiana in 1993. Examples of other amphibians in Louisiana are salamanders such as the eastern tiger salamander, southern red-backed salamander, Gulf Coast waterdog, dwarf salamander and the three-toed amphiuma.</p>
<h2 id=what-foods-are-grown-in-the-state-of-louisiana>What foods are grown in the state of Louisiana?</h2>
<p>Soybeans, cotton, dairy products, strawberries, hay, pecans, and vegetables are also abundant in the state. In addition, Louisiana is well-known for its fishing industry that is dominated by shrimp, menhaden (mostly used to make fishmeal for poultry) and oysters. Tourism is also a large part of Louisiana’s economy.</p>
