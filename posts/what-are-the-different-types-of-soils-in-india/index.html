<p>There are seven soil deposits in India. They are alluvial soil, black soil, red soil, laterite soil, or arid soil, and forest and mountainous soil,marsh soil. These soils are formed by the sediments brought down by the rivers. They are also have varied chemical properties.</p>

<h2 id=loamy-which-is-the-most-common-type-of-soil-in-india>Loamy. Which is the most common type of soil in India?</h2>
<p>Saline-Alkaline soil is found in canal areas. In moderate arid condition, calcification occurs and in extreme arid conditions, salinity occurs. Major areas of Saline and Alkaline soils in India are – Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra etc.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-black-soils-found-in-india>Where are the black soils found in India?</h2>
<p>These soils are commonly found in central, western and southern states of India including Maharashtra, Western parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and some parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Black soils are characterized by a dark grey to black colour, high clay content, and neutral to slightly alkaline in reaction.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-saline-and-alkaline-soils-found-in-india>Where are saline and alkaline soils found in India?</h2>
<p>Saline-Alkaline soil is found in canal areas. In moderate arid condition, calcification occurs and in extreme arid conditions, salinity occurs. Major areas of Saline and Alkaline soils in India are – Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra etc. The soil is best for crops like Seem, Rice, Sugarcane, Fruits, Spices etc. 7.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-crops-are-grown-in-south-india>What kind of crops are grown in South India?</h2>
<p>Plantation of crops like tropical fruits, coffee, tea or spices in states of south India like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are undertaken in this type of soil. In the drier areas or deciduous forest belt, deep soil, brown in colour and rich in humus is found.</p>
