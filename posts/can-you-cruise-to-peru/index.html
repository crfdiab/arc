<h2 id=can-you-cruise-to-peru>Can you cruise to Peru?</h2>
<p>You can visit Peru on a South America cruise that travels between Southern California and Chile or visit two local ports on our Best of Chile & Peru cruise which includes a double overnight in Lima, Peru, with overland access to Machu Picchu and the Amazon River.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-cruise-one-way>Is it possible to cruise one-way?</h2>
<p>The short answer is “yes, but infrequently, and slowly if all you want is travel.” Although round-trip cruises are the norm, you can find quite a few one-way trips: some part of air/cruise packages, others offered alone. And for basic transportation on a few routes, freighter trips or ferries may be the best answer.</p>
<h2 id=are-cruise-ships-sailing-in-the-mediterranean>Are cruise ships sailing in the Mediterranean?</h2>
<p>As the first step to restring cruise operations for the summer of 2021 in the Mediterranean, two large ships returned to service on May 1 sailing from Italy. MSC had resumed service with one cruise ship, the MSC Grandiosa in 2020 and is working to expand operations into the summer of 2021.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-one-way-cruise-called>What is a one-way cruise called?</h2>
<p>repositioning cruise<br>
A repositioning cruise is an exciting journey full of relaxing days at sea and stops in exotic destinations along the way. These one-way itineraries start in one major cruise destination and end in another.</p>
<h2 id=do-repositioning-cruises-have-entertainment>Do repositioning cruises have entertainment?</h2>
<p>Many people falsely believe that since the cruise is being repositioned, there is a lack of entertainment and things to do onboard. It’s actually the opposite. Cruise lines book extra entertainment, added lecturers, and pencil in more scheduled activities to fill those additional days sea days.</p>
<h2 id=are-repositioning-cruises-worth-it>Are repositioning cruises worth it?</h2>
<p>The main reason cruise aficionados love repositioning cruises is because they’re cheap. Fares may be half the cost of a typical cruise because cruise lines just want to offset the cost of moving the ship from port to port. There are less tangible benefits, too.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-month-for-a-mediterranean-cruise>What is the best month for a Mediterranean cruise?</h2>
<p>For optimal weather and adventures aplenty, the best time to cruise the Mediterranean is in the spring, summer or fall season, from early April through late November. During the winter, many locals close up shop, making it difficult for travelers to enjoy the full Mediterranean experience.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-rough-seas-in-the-mediterranean>Are there rough seas in the Mediterranean?</h2>
<p>Rough Waters: Cruise travelers might experience rough seas in several places in Europe. The biggest offender is the Mediterranean, which tends to be roughest in the fall and winter, due to winds and storms. However, avid cruisers have experienced rough seas in the spring and summer, so be prepared for anything.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-stay-on-cruise-ship-at-port>Can I stay on cruise ship at port?</h2>
<p>Nope. The choice is totally yours. You can go ashore on a tour, explore the cruise port on your own or stay onboard and relax by the pool, book a (usually discounted on port days) spa treatment or take advantage of other activities on your ship during the day.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-repositioning-cruises-cheaper>Why are repositioning cruises cheaper?</h2>
<p>1. Book Too Early. A repositioning cruise is usually cheaper than a regular cruise due to the large number of sea days. However, try to avoid booking your cruise too early as last-minute deals are a regular occurrence.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-sail-through-the-mediterranean>How long does it take to sail through the Mediterranean?</h2>
<p>By our reckoning, a direct passage through would take in the region of 30 days, although it’s also feasible to cut maybe a week out of this by going relatively non-stop. Conversely, taking in the sights and taking time to enjoy would add a week or more.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-sail-across-the-pacific-ocean>How long does it take to sail across the Pacific Ocean?</h2>
<p>How long does it take to sail across Pacific? It takes between 30 – 40 days to cross the Pacific, depending on your port of departure and arrival. It’s about 4,000 nautical miles, which is roughly twice as long as the Atlantic crossing. The Pacific crossing is one of the longest ocean crossings possible.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-sail-from-athens-to-greece>How long does it take to sail from Athens to Greece?</h2>
<p>Speeds can be higher, depending on your sailing skills Not sure where to go? For some suggested sailing routes from our Athens base for both one and two week sailing charters have a look at our greek island charter routes for a little inspiration, we look forward to welcoming you to Greece soon!</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-best-places-to-sail-in-the-mediterranean>Where are the best places to sail in the Mediterranean?</h2>
<p>Main sailing areas: 1 Western Mediterranean – this is the area spanning from the Straits of Gibraltar to the heel of Italy 2 Adriatic – separating the Italian coast from the coast of Croatia, Montenegro, and Albania 3 Greece – the Aegean and Ionian Sea 4 Turkey 5 The Levant – the Eastern Med 6 North Africa More …</p>
