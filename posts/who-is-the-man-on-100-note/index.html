<h2 id=how-much-is-a-10000-bill-worth>How much is a $10000 bill worth?</h2>

<h2 id=who-is-on-the-one-hundred-dollar-note>Who is on the one hundred dollar note?</h2>
<p>The new one-hundred-dollar note featured Ernest Rutherford on the front, with the Nobel Prize medal he won in 1908. The Nobel Foundation gave permission for the image of the medal to be used.
