<p>Keller’s local roots stretch back to 1896, when she and her nearly-lifelong teacher, the equally-famous Annie Sullivan, used to spend summers in Wrentham on Red Farm on Route 140 (Franklin Street). It was a time when Wrentham with its lakes was a bustling summer resort.</p>

<p>When she was eight years old in the summer of 1888, Helen Keller visited the ocean for the first time during her vacation at Brewster, on Cape Cod, with a family friend named Mrs. Hopkins. Anne Sullivan, Helen’s teacher, came too, of course. She loved the beach, including the crab that Anne Sullivan showed her.</p>

<p>In 1955, at age 75, Keller embarked on the longest and most grueling trip of her life: a 40,000-mile, five-month trek across Asia. Through her many speeches and appearances, she brought inspiration and encouragement to millions of people.</p>
<h2 id=did-helen-keller-ever-have-a-boyfriend>Did Helen Keller ever have a boyfriend?</h2>
<p>Helen fell in love with a fellow named Peter Fagan – a love that she referred to throughout her life – a love which was denied to her by time, by circumstance and by greed. I will never think of Annie Sullivan in any way but as a person who abused her position and abused her trust.</p>
<h2 id=was-helen-keller-the-youngest-child>Was Helen Keller the youngest child?</h2>
<p>Helen was the first child to Arthur and Kate Keller. Her father, Arthur Keller, was not only a distant cousin to Robert E. Lee, but he served in the Confederate Army. After the war, he was an editor for the North Alabamian.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-helen-keller-learn-to-read-and-write>How did Helen Keller learn to read and write?</h2>
<p>Despite being blind as well as deaf, with the help of her teacher and friend Anne Mansfield Sullivan, she learned to use the hand signals of the deaf-mute, the Braille alphabet and also learned to lip-read by placing her fingers on the lips and throat of the speaker. Keller with Anne Sullivan vacationing on Cape Cod in July, 1888.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-helen-keller-when-she-became-blind>How old was Helen Keller when she became blind?</h2>
<p>In February, 1882, at the age of nineteen months, Helen fell ill with “an acute congestion of the stomach and brain”, which could possibly have been scarlet fever or meningitis. This illness left her deaf and blind. Later on, her spirit was liberated from the “world of silence and darkness” by her teacher, Anne Sullivan.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-helen-kellers-dog>What was the name of Helen Keller’s dog?</h2>
<p>Hachiko in his later years. Keller was so impressed by the Akita dogs that she expressed a desire to have one. The Japanese government immediately contacted a man named Ichiro Ogasawara, who owned Akita dogs and gave her one of his puppies. The dog was named Kamikaze-Go. Unfortunately, Kamikaze-Go died before he was eight months old.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-helen-adams-keller-born-and-raised>Where was Helen Adams Keller born and raised?</h2>
<p>Helen Adams Keller was born on a plantation called Ivy Green in Tuscumbia, Alabama, on June 27, 1880. She was the eldest daughter of Captain Arthur H. Keller, a former officer of the Confederate Army, and Kate Adams. Helen was named after her grandmother, Helen Everett.</p>
