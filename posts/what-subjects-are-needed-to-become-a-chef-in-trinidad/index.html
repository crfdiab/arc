<p>Qualifications and Training Needed to be a Chef While formal education isn’t required to become a chef, the specialised knowledge and skills learned during professional cookery courses can serve aspiring chefs. Getting a qualification at college or an apprenticeship is an important piece of traineeship that gives chefs an outline of cookery.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-education-requirements-for-a-pastry-chef>What are the education requirements for a pastry chef?</h2>
<p>Apprentices are also required to complete 12 formal courses in culinary subjects, such as food safety, nutrition and management. Completion of apprenticeship programs may result in professional credentials or associate’s degrees. While not mandatory, many dessert and pastry chefs demonstrate culinary skills by earning professional certification.</p>
