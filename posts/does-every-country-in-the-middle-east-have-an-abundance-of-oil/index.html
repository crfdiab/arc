<h2 id=does-every-country-in-the-middle-east-have-an-abundance-of-oil>Does every country in the Middle East have an abundance of oil?</h2>
<p>The Middle East’s association with oil production primarily comes from countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait. Each of these has over 100 billions of barrels in proved reserves.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-most-of-the-oil-in-the-middle-east-come-from>Where does most of the oil in the Middle East come from?</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest oil producer and accounts for roughly 15% of global output. Iraq has increased production since the end of the Iraq War and is now the second-largest producer in the Middle East.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-middle-east-have-the-most-oil-reserves>Does the Middle East have the most oil reserves?</h2>
<p>The world’s largest oil reserves can be found in the Middle East region. Saudi Arabia has the second largest world reserves right behind Venezuela….Volume of oil reserves in the Middle East in 2018, by country (in billion barrels)</p>
<table><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Reserves in billion barrels</th></tr><tr><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-oil-reserves-does-the-middle-east-have>What percentage of oil reserves does the Middle East have?</h2>
<p>According to current estimates, 79.4% of the world’s proven oil reserves are located in OPEC Member Countries, with the bulk of OPEC oil reserves in the Middle East, amounting to 64.5% of the OPEC total.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-are-the-oil-reserves-in-the-middle-east>How big are the oil reserves in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>In reviewing the table of Middle East oil reserves, you will notice that no country in the region ranks for the top oil reserves in the world. So which country does rank number one? The answer is Venezuela with an estimated 300 billion barrels available of proved crude oil reserves.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-middle-east-an-oil-rich-country>Is the Middle East an oil rich country?</h2>
<p>The terms “Middle East” and “oil-rich” are often taken as synonyms of each other. Talk of the Middle East and oil has made it seem as if every country in the Middle East were an oil-rich, oil-producing exporter. Yet, the reality is at odds with that assumption. The Greater Middle East adds up to more than 30 countries.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-lot-of-gas-in-the-middle-east>Is there a lot of gas in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>In addition, the Middle East holds 40% of the world’s conventional gas reserves. Despite our best estimates, it is not exactly known how much oil and gas exist in the Middle East and how much of it can be recovered in the future, but there is probably more to Middle East petroleum than what we currently know. Where is the Middle East?</p>
<h2 id=how-many-countries-are-in-the-middle-east>How many countries are in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Yet, the reality is at odds with that assumption. The Greater Middle East adds up to more than 30 countries. Only a few of those have significant oil reserves and produce enough oil to slake their energy needs and export oil as well.</p>
