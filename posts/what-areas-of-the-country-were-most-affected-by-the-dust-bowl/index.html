<h2 id=what-areas-of-the-country-were-most-affected-by-the-dust-bowl>What areas of the country were most affected by the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>Although it technically refers to the western third of Kansas, southeastern Colorado, the Oklahoma Panhandle, the northern two-thirds of the Texas Panhandle, and northeastern New Mexico, the Dust Bowl has come to symbolize the hardships of the entire nation during the 1930s.</p>
<h2 id=which-region-of-the-us-suffered-most-from-the-dust-bowl>Which region of the US suffered most from the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>Between 1930 and 1940, the southwestern Great Plains region of the United States suffered a severe drought.</p>
<h2 id=which-region-of-the-country-was-most-negatively-affected-by-the-dust-bowl>Which region of the country was most negatively affected by the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>As a result, dust storms raged nearly everywhere, but the most severely affected areas were in the Oklahoma (Cimarron, Texas, and Beaver counties) and Texas panhandles, western Kansas, and eastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-interesting-facts-about-the-dust-bowl>What are some interesting facts about the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>Interesting Dust Bowl Facts: The Dust Bowl is also often referred to as the Dirty Thirties. Some of the reasons that the Dust Bowl occurred were over-farming, livestock over-grazing, drought and poor farming practices. There were more than 100 million acres of land affected by the Dust Bowl. There were 14 dust storms in 1932 on the Great Plains.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-affected-by-the-dust-bowl>Who was affected by the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>It didn’t stop there; the Dust Bowl affected all people. Families wore respiratory masks handed out by Red Cross workers, cleaned their homes each morning with shovels and brooms, and draped wet sheets over doors and windows to help filter out the dust. Still, children and adults inhaled sand, coughed up dirt, and died of a new epidemic called “dust pneumonia.”</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-conditions-of-the-dust-bowl>What were the conditions of the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>The Dust Bowl was the name given to the drought-stricken Southern Plains region of the United States, which suffered severe dust storms during a dry period in the 1930s. As high winds and choking dust swept the region from Texas to Nebraska, people and livestock were killed and crops failed across the entire region.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-us-dust-bowl-drought-of-the-1930s>What caused the U.S. Dust Bowl drought of the 1930’s?</h2>
<p>The Dust Bowl disaster was caused by a series of devastating droughts in the 1930s, poor soil conservation techniques and over-farming. The lack of rainfall and moisture in the air dried out the topsoil of the farming regions in the prairie states.</p>
