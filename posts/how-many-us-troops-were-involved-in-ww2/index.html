<p>“The number of Americans who were in uniform peaked during the national mobilizations of World War I and World War II, particularly the latter, when more than 16 million Americans were in the armed forces. As a proportion of the population, 14 times as many Americans served in World War II as did in the wars of the last decade.”.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-jews-served-in-the-us-army-during-world-war-2>How many Jews served in the US Army during World War 2?</h2>
<p>During the course of World War II, 550,000 Jewish men and women served in the armed forces of the United States. (Another 1 million Jews served in other Allied forces – 500,000 in the Soviet Army, 100,000 in Polish Military and 30,000 in British Army.)</p>

<p>5 million Italian-American soldiers served in World War II, accounting for 10% of the armed forces, of whom 14 won Medals of Honor. While Italian-Americans were in general enthusiastic participants in the Allied cause, several Italian-language newspapers were forced to close because of past support of the fascist government of Benito Mussolini.</p>
