<h2 id=why-are-annulments-denied>Why are annulments denied?</h2>
<p>Reasons for Annulment Denial In some cases, grounds may include aspects like bigamy, the fact that your partner was already married, coercion, forced marriage, and fraud if you were tricked into marriage. Your spouse may argue against your case and you may have no other choice but to receive a no-fault divorce.</p>
<h2 id=when-can-a-marriage-be-annulled-in-usa>When can a marriage be annulled in USA?</h2>
<p>The legal grounds for obtaining an annulment vary between states, but typically include reasons like the following: One or both spouses were forced or tricked into the marriage. One or both spouses were not able to make a decision to marry due to a mental disability, drugs, or alcohol.</p>

<p>Annulling a Void Marriage While a divorce terminates a legal marriage, an annulment means that the marriage never legally existed in the first place. Since these marriages were never valid at all, you can usually annul such marriages at any point in time as long as both you and your spouse are living.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-fight-an-annulment>How do you fight an annulment?</h2>
<p>You cannot simply challenge an annulment by telling the court that you wish to remain married. Rather, you are challenging the material representations made by the petitioner. For example, if the grounds for annulment are listed as fraud in the petition, you will need to argue that the fraud never occurred.</p>

<h2 id=can-you-get-an-annulment-if-you-have-children>Can you get an annulment if you have children?</h2>
<p>Some states do not allow annulment if the marriage produced children. In these states, the marriage can only end through divorce. In states that do allow annulment, the status of the children remains the same as they would in the case of divorce. Annulment does not mean that your children automatically become illegitimate under any circumstance.</p>
