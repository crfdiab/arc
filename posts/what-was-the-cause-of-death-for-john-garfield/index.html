<h2 id=what-heart-condition-did-john-garfield>What heart condition did John Garfield?</h2>
<p>Despite a history of heart problems, many close to Garfield attributed his death from coronary thrombosis at age 39 to the stress of his House Committee ordeal.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, Andrew Garfield was only paid $500,000 to star in The Amazing Spider-Man. From the outside looking in, the amount of money that certain stars get paid for a role can be pretty baffling.</p>
<h2 id=is-emma-stone-dating-andrew-garfield>Is Emma Stone Dating Andrew Garfield?</h2>
<p>Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone met while filming 2010’s The Amazing Spider-Man. They started dating the following year after both parties split from their then-significant others.

<p>May 22, 1959 12 AM PT NEW YORK, May 21 (AP) — John Garfield, 39, “tough guy” screen and stage star, died of a heart attack in bed today in the two-room Gramercy Park apartment of Iris Whitney, an actress friend.

<h2 id=is-the-death-of-garfield-really-a-dream>Is the death of Garfield really a dream?</h2>
<p>However, logically it is that strip which is the true reality & the rest of the garfield comics which are the dream. Denial doesn’t make something cease to exist, it merely masks it with an illusion. My present day take on the story is that garfield is not dead (yet), but is alone & slowing starving to death in the empty house.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-president-garfield-die-from-a-bullet-in-the-back>How did President Garfield die from a bullet in the back?</h2>
<p>The shot in the back was not fatal, not hitting any vital organs. The bullet lodged behind the pancreas. “If they had just left him alone he almost certainly would have survived,” Millard said. Within minutes, doctors converged on the fallen president, using their fingers to poke and prod his open wounds.</p>
