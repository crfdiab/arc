<h2 id=what-is-the-most-dangerous-time-to-cross-a-coastal-bar>What is the most dangerous time to cross a coastal bar?</h2>
<p>Cross with an incoming tide – it’s always safer. Avoid crossing with an outgoing (ebb) tide – this is the most dangerous time to cross because dangerous waves are more likely. Once you start crossing, keep going – trying to turn around in the middle of a bar can be risky, including an increased risk of swamping.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-operate-a-boat-in-new-york>How old do you have to be to operate a boat in New York?</h2>
<p>New York Boating Laws and Regulations Age and Operator Restrictions. A person at least 10 years old may operate a recreational boat (other than a PWC) only if only if you meet the requirement to have a Boating Safety Certificate as shown in the table. If you are required to have a Boating Safety Certificate, you must carry it on board the vessel.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-drive-a-pwc-boat>How old do you have to be to drive a PWC boat?</h2>
