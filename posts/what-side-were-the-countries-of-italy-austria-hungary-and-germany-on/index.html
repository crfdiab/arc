<h2 id=which-countries-were-allied-against-germany-and-austria-hungary>Which countries were allied against Germany and Austria-Hungary?</h2>
<p>The Allies described the wartime military alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire as the ‘Central Powers’. The name referred to the geographical location of the two original members of the alliance, Germany and Austria-Hungary, in central Europe.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-austria-hungary-and-germany>What was the relationship between Austria-Hungary and Germany?</h2>

<h2 id=when-did-prussia-enter-into-a-customs-union-with-germany>When did Prussia enter into a customs union with Germany?</h2>

<h2 id=what-did-germany-do-to-austria-after-world-war-2>What did Germany do to Austria after World War 2?</h2>
<p>After losing the war, the Habsburgs of Austria-Hungary were overthrown and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany abdicated in 1918. Both Germany and Austria became republics and were heavily punished in the Treaty of Versailles (1919) and Treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye (1919).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-austria-become-a-member-of-the-european-union>When did Austria become a member of the European Union?</h2>
<p>After Austria’s entry into the European Union in 1995, both countries are member-states of the Schengen Agreement. Whereas Germany is a member nation of NATO, Austria remains a partner to NATO in accordance with its constitution to maintain neutrality.</p>
