<h2 id=why-was-john-tyler-expelled-from-the-whig-party>Why was John Tyler expelled from the Whig Party?</h2>
<p>He believed that the president should set policy rather than Congress, and he sought to bypass the Whig establishment, led by Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky. Most of Tyler’s Cabinet resigned soon into his term, and the Whigs dubbed him His Accidency and expelled him from the party.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-john-tyler-became-president>How did John Tyler became president?</h2>
<p>The presidency of John Tyler began on April 4, 1841, when John Tyler became President of the United States upon the death of President William Henry Harrison, and ended on March 4, 1845. He had been Vice President of the United States for only 31 days when he assumed the presidency.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-john-tyler-stand-for>What did John Tyler stand for?</h2>
<p>John Tyler (1790-1862) served as America’s 10th president from 1841 to 1845. Among his administration’s accomplishments was the 1845 annexation of Texas. Before he died, Tyler voted for Virginia’s secession from the Union and was elected to the Confederate Congress.</p>

<p>March 29, 1790, Charles City County, Virginia, United States<br>

<h2 id=what-is-the-11-president>What is the 11 President?</h2>
<p>James K. Polk<br>
Often referred to as the first “dark horse” President, James K. Polk was the last of the Jacksonians to sit in the White House, and the last strong President until the Civil War. He was born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, in 1795.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-tyler-the-creator-born-and-raised>Where was Tyler the creator born and raised?</h2>
<p>Tyler Gregory Okonma was born on March 6, 1991 in Ladera Heights, California, the son of a Nigerian father of Igbo descent and a mother of mixed African-American and European-Canadian descent.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-number-one-president-of-the-tyler-family>Who was the number one president of the Tyler family?</h2>
<p>But William Tyler, Harrison Tyler’s son and John Tyler’s great-grandson, spoke with U.S. News about the family’s history. ” There was a book that was recently written and it voted John Tyler as the number one president,” says William Tyler, president of the foundation for Sherwood Forest Plantation, President Tyler’s estate.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-president-tyler-when-his-grandchildren-were-born>How old was President Tyler when his grandchildren were born?</h2>
<p>His living grandchildren weren’t born until the 1920s, during the Coolidge administration. President John Tyler had been dead for more than 60 years by the time two of his grandchildren were born. (Courtesy of the National Archives/Newsmakers)</p>
<h2 id=why-did-james-tyler-become-vice-president-of-the-united-states>Why did James Tyler become Vice President of the United States?</h2>
<p>For the first time in American history, the vice president became the president because of death. Tyler disagreed with some of his party’s positions, and Whigs in Congress were frustrated that they could not control Tyler and the presidency. Tyler’s presidency would go down as one of the most ineffective and combative in American history.</p>
