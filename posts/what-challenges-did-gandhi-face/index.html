<h2 id=what-challenges-did-gandhi-face>What challenges did Gandhi face?</h2>
<p>He was so well known for overcoming many challenges such as; Ridiculous discrimination for being an Indian in South Africa, he was humiliated and beaten for what he believed in.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-major-problem-of-indians-according-to-gandhi>What was the major problem of Indians according to Gandhi?</h2>
<p>Indians, he wrote, had lost their spiritual strength because they had lost their healthy respect for religion. They had forgotten that there was divinity in each of them, which would guide them along the true path and the consciousness of which drove away all illusory fears, save the fear of God.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-mahatma-gandhi-struggle-for-freedom-of-india>How did Mahatma Gandhi struggle for freedom of India?</h2>
<p>Champaran Movement (1917): Gandhi’s active participation in the Freedom Struggle started when he led the Champaran rebellion in Bihar. The movement was an approach of civil disobedience to make Britishers agree to the demand of farmers, who were forcefully made to grow Indigo.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-difficulties-faced-by-gandhi-in-his-initial-years-of-practise>What are the difficulties faced by Gandhi in his initial years of Practise?</h2>
<p>Perhaps more basic was Gandhi’s challenge, first of all to himself, to exercise strong self-discipline. He did it in many ways. He dressed very simply, and shaved his head. He didn’t go to concerts or the theatre.</p>
<h2 id=what-lessons-can-we-learn-from-mahatma-gandhi>What lessons can we learn from Mahatma Gandhi?</h2>
<p>10 lines from Mahatma Gandhi</p>
<ul>
<li>Live life to the fullest. It’s the quality of your life that matters, not the speed with which you live.</li>
<li>Always speak the truth.</li>
<li>Let the change begin with you.</li>
<li>Believe in love.</li>
<li>Think before you act.</li>
<li>Live to learn.</li>
<li>Be positive.</li>
<li>Learn to forgive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-were-mahatma-gandhis-main-ideas-and-activities>What were Mahatma Gandhi’s main ideas and activities?</h2>
<p>Satyagraha (firmness in truth) and sarvodaya (welfare of all) are the core concepts of Mahatma Gandhi’s political philosophy. Satyagraha became the alternative nonviolent resistance soul force of the oppressed against injustice—an alternative to guerrilla war, civil war and genocide.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-mahatma-gandhis-system-of-nonviolence-based-on>What was Mahatma Gandhis system of nonviolence based on?</h2>
<p>Gandhi s system of Satyagraha was based on nonviolence, non co-operation, truth and honesty. Gandhi used non violence in India s freedom struggle as main weapon and India became independent from British rule.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-indira-gandhis-rule-in-india>What was the impact of Indira Gandhis rule in India?</h2>
<p>Some 10 million refugees fled across the border from East Pakistan to India in the ensuing eight months of martial rule and sporadic firing by West Pakistan’s army. Soon after the monsoon stopped, India’s army moved up to the Bangladesh border and by early December had advanced virtually unopposed to Dhaka, which was surrendered in mid-December.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-description-of-the-gandhian-strategy>Which is the best description of the Gandhian strategy?</h2>
<p>The Gandhian strategy is the combination of truth, sacrifice, non- violence, selfless service and cooperation.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-indian-independence-struggle>What was the result of the Indian independence struggle?</h2>
<p>The campaign failed to bring independence or even major concessions, but it inspired the Indian people and, as Jawaharlal Nehru put it, widened the outlook of “the village masses,” who for the first time “began to think a little in terms of India as a whole.”</p>
