<p>In another word we can understand as if a animal bites you and you die then the animal is venomous and if you bite the animal and you die then it is poisonous. * Garter snake (Thamnophis) is non venomous which means it is harmless in terms of its bite but poisonous as eating it is toxic (its body surface has toxins).</p>

<p>Most snakes are not venomous if they bite. If you are bitten by a nonvenomous snake, you will recover. The possible complications of a nonvenomous bite include a retained tooth in the puncture wounds or a wound infection (including tetanus). Snakes do not carry or transmit rabies.</p>
<h2 id=are-pigs-immune-to-snake-venom>Are pigs immune to snake venom?</h2>
<p>No animal is immune to snake bites, but pigs have a thicker layer of skin than most animals. According to the findings, pig skin necrotized at the same rate of human skin when snake venom was injected. With that being said, a pig’s reaction to a snake bite largely depends on the pig itself.</p>

<h2 id=what-are-the-3-types-of-snake-venom>What are the 3 types of snake venom?</h2>
<p>The pharmacological effects of snake venoms are classified into three main types, hemotoxic, neurotoxic, and cytotoxic (WHO, 2010).</p>

<p>The snakes are largely arboreal and remain well camouflaged within trees and bushes by virtue of their green color. Green mamba venom is extremely potent, a toxic cocktail of cardiotoxins, neurotoxins, fasciculins, and calcicludine. Deaths within half an hour of receiving a snake bite from the green mamba have been known to occur.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-venomous-snake-in-the-philippines>Which is the most venomous snake in the Philippines?</h2>
