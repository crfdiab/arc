<p>1794<br>
A labor union is an association of workers formed to negotiate collectively with an employer to protect and further workers’ rights and interests. Sustained trade union organizing among American workers began in 1794 with the establishment of the first trade union.</p>
<h2 id=what-benefits-did-labor-unions-help-gain-for-workers>What benefits did labor unions help gain for workers?</h2>
<p>The Union Difference</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Voice on the job. Better workplaces and working conditions without the fear of retaliation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Higher Wages. $191 per week than their nonunion counterparts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better Benefits. More likely to have employer-provided pensions and health insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safer Workplace.</p>

<h2 id=higher-wages-how-did-labor-unions-help-the-american-working-class>Higher Wages. How did labor unions help the American working class?</h2>
<p>Unions raise pay, improve benefits, and strengthen economic conditions. Unions raise wages for all types of workers. The union wage premium is even larger for some demographic groups, including workers of color and those without a college degree.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-labor-unions-help-improve-working-conditions>How did labor unions help improve working conditions?</h2>
<p>Forming groups of workers, they went to their bosses and asked them to raise their wages and improve working conditions. Unions were able to get a minimum wage for all the workers. They were able to shorten the workday to 8 hours, instead of the original 10 or more. Unions also were able to shorten the workweek to 5 days.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-labor-movement-do-for-people>What did the labor movement do for people?</h2>
<p>For those in the industrial sector, organized labor unions fought for better wages, reasonable hours and safer working conditions. The labor movement led efforts to stop child labor, give health benefits and provide aid to workers who were injured or retired.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-unions-do-for-non-union-workers>What do unions do for non union workers?</h2>
<p>Because unions garner generally higher wages for their members – roughly 10 to 25 percenthigher than for non-union members – their erosion has meant that workers who may have once belonged to one miss out on this premium. Strong unions boost the wages of workers who don’t belong to one, too.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-labor-unions>What are the different types of labor unions?</h2>
<p>­ A labor union is an organization of workers dedicated to protecting their interests and improving wages, hours and working conditions. Many different types of workers belong to unions: mechanics, teachers, factory workers, actors, police officers, airline pilots, janitors, doctors, writers and so forth.</p>
