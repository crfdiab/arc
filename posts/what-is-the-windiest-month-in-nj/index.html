<h2 id=what-is-the-deadliest-wind>What is the deadliest wind?</h2>
<p>The most intense storm in the Eastern Pacific Ocean by both sustained winds and central pressure was Hurricane Patricia. Its sustained winds of 345 km/h (215 mph) are also the highest on record globally.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-worst-storm-to-hit-new-jersey>What was the worst storm to hit New Jersey?</h2>
<p>As we wait for Florence’s aftermath to make its way to New Jersey, we took a look back at the five worst storms to hit the Jersey Shore. They struck while too many had their guards down. Damage north of the casino in Asbury Park after the hurricane of 1944. (Photo: Asbury Park Press)</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-storm-hit-in-cape-may-nj>Where did the storm hit in Cape May NJ?</h2>
<p>We don’t really have much information on the devastation it caused to Cape May, since there were only 4,000 citizens in the area at the time. However, records show that people as far as Philadelphia felt the storm winds. In New York City, flooding had also occurred through the streets of Manhattan as a direct result of the storm. Scary! 8.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-highest-snowfall-in-new-jersey>Where was the highest snowfall in New Jersey?</h2>
<p>For reference, the highest snowfall total ever recorded in New Jersey was 34 inches in Cape May, back in 1899. Everyone experienced the storm differently. Wildwood Crest reported just 4.5 inches of snow, along with rain.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-ash-wednesday-storm-hit-the-jersey-shore>When did the Ash Wednesday Storm hit the Jersey Shore?</h2>
<p>Carloads of lumber, fuel tanks and refrigerators floated by. These accounts from survivors of the March 1962 nor’easter, also known as the Ash Wednesday Storm, are found in “Great Storms of the Jersey Shore,” a book by two local writers, Larry Savadove and Margaret Thomas Buchholz.</p>
