This low pressure makes Rita the strongest hurricane every recorded in the Gulf of Mexico, and 4th strongest in the Atlantic Basin.</p>

<h2 id=how-fast-was-hurricane-rita-moving-at-landfall>How fast was Hurricane Rita moving at landfall?</h2>
<p>Hurricane Rita made landfall about 258 km (161 mi) southeast of Sabine Pass at the Texas/Louisiana border, on 24 September as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph).</p>
<h2 id=what-cities-were-affected-by-hurricane-rita>What cities were affected by Hurricane Rita?</h2>

<h2 id=how-does-a-hurricane-gain-strength-and-speed>How does a hurricane gain strength and speed?</h2>
<p>Hurricanes gain strength from warm moist air rising from water in the tropics. These moisture-driven storms begin as low pressure areas that form over warm ocean waters in the summer and early fall, and gain strength and speed as winds within the low pressure zone organize into a rotation. A hurricane begins as…</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-saffir-simpson-hurricane-wind-scale-work>How does the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale work?</h2>
<p>The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a 1 to 5 rating based only on a hurricane’s maximum sustained wind speed. This scale does not take into account other potentially deadly hazards such as storm surge, rainfall flooding, and tornadoes.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-wind-speed-does-a-hurricane-have>What kind of wind speed does a hurricane have?</h2>
<p>Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a 1 to 5 rating based on a hurricane’s sustained wind speed.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-screws-can-you-use-for-hurricane-clips>What kind of screws can you use for hurricane clips?</h2>
<p>The ONLY screws acceptable for use with hurricane clips are the screws specified by the clip manufacturer. They are engineered for use with clips. NO other screw can be used. In spite of anything you’ve seen on Holmes on Homes you can’t just use any screws on your clips.</p>
