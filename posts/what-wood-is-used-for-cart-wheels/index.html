<h2 id=what-wood-is-used-for-cart-wheels>What wood is used for cart wheels?</h2>
<p>Wheelwrighting today The main timbers used in a traditional wooden wheel are Elm for the nave, Oak for the spokes and Ash for the felloes although this can vary in some areas depending on availability of timber, climate and style of production.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-used-for-carriage-wheels-and-spokes>What was used for carriage wheels and spokes?</h2>
<p>The original type of spoked wheel with wooden spokes was used for horse-drawn carriages and wagons. In early motor cars, wooden spoked wheels of the artillery type were normally used.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-wheelwrights-make-wheels>How did wheelwrights make wheels?</h2>
<p>Making Wheels Wheelwrights cut, chiseled, fashioned, and shaped wheels from wood. The spokes and hubs were also made of wood. They used iron rims, often made by local blacksmiths, to fit around the exterior of the wheels. This is how the spokes were fastened in the hub and rim.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-they-make-wagon-wheels>How did they make wagon wheels?</h2>
<p>The first wheels were simply solid discs, carved out of one lump of wood, with solid wheels made from three shaped planks following dating from about 5000 BC. Solid wheels were not only heavy, but also tended to break across the grain of the wood, and so an improved and lighter wheel became desirable.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-wheelwright-called-today>What is a wheelwright called today?</h2>
<p>The charron, or wheelwright, manufactured, repaired, painted and decorated wagons, carts, wheelbarrows or any other vehicle with wheels, for work or leisure. Most wheels were made from wood or iron. In France, a charron could also be called an embatteur de roues, a rodier or a royer.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-does-a-wheelwright-make>How much money does a wheelwright make?</h2>
<p>The salaries of Wheelwrights in the US range from $22,060 to $63,560 , with a median salary of $37,730 . The middle 60% of Wheelwrights makes $37,730, with the top 80% making $63,560.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-would-a-wagon-wheel-last>How long would a wagon wheel last?</h2>
<p>Rubber not only makes less noise on pavement than steel tires, the wheel rolls better which makes it easier to pull. Rubber will last for 2000 -4000 miles before having to be replaced, depending on surface and conditions.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-wagon-wheels-dished>Why are wagon wheels dished?</h2>
<p>Sturt’s main reason for dishing was, however, a structural one. The dished wheel was able to bear lateral thrust, produced by the side-to-side movement of the horse-drawn vehicle, and also by the jolting movement produced by the wheel when it fell into a rut.</p>
<h2 id=what-skills-do-i-need-to-be-a-wheelwright>What skills do I need to be a wheelwright?</h2>
<p>The wheelwright trade required a person to be strong and able to work with wood and metal. It also required the tradesman to be very careful and accurate. Precise measurement skills were important to make sure that all the parts of the wheel would fit together so the wheel would roll smoothly.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-hansen-wheel-and-wagon-shop>Who is the Hansen wheel and wagon shop?</h2>
<p>Hansen Wheel & Wagon Shop has grown to be the premier builder of authentic, horse-drawn vehicles. For thirty-five years, our experienced staff of dedicated craftsmen has fashioned a line of superior quality wagons, wheels, and equipment to suit a wide range of individual budgets and interests.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-wheels-of-the-first-cart-come-from>Where did the wheels of the first CART come from?</h2>
<p>The evidence suggests that small wagons or carts, likely drawn by cattle, were in use in Central Europe by this time in human history. The first carts featured wheels and axles that turned together. Wooden pegs were used to fix the sledge so that when it rested on the rollers it did not move.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-invention-of-the-wheel-do-for-mankind>What did the invention of the wheel do for mankind?</h2>
<p>The wheel alone, without any further innovation, would not have done much for mankind. Rather, it was the combination of the wheel and axle that made early forms of transportation possible, including carts and chariots.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-a-wheelwright-make-a-felloe-wheel>How did a wheelwright Make A felloe wheel?</h2>
<p>The wheelwright trimmed the battered end of the spoke into a square end to match the square hole cut for it in the felloe. After hammering the felloe into place, a wooden or steel wedge driven into a precut notch at the end of the spoke locked it into place.</p>
