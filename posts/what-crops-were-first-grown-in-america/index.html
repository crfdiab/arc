<h2 id=what-crops-were-first-grown-in-america>What crops were first grown in America?</h2>
<p>The first American farmers: 5000 – 2500 BC The cultivation of crops in America begins in the Tehuacan valley, southeast of the present-day Mexico City. Squash and chili are the earliest plants to be grown – soon followed by corn (or maize) and then by beans and gourds.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-first-crops-grown>What were the first crops grown?</h2>
<p>The early humans shifted from hunting-gathering to agriculture. Wheat and barley were the first crops to be cultivated.</p>
<h2 id=what-crops-did-north-america-grow>What crops did North America grow?</h2>
<p>Many tobacco and cotton fields are now alternately planted with rye, corn (maize), soybeans, and winter wheat grown as fodder for cattle or as additional cash crops.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-first-2-crops>What were the first 2 crops?</h2>
<p>The earliest domesticated plants found on Near Eastern sites are einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum), emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum subspecies dicoccum), two-row barley (Hordeum distichum), rye (Secale cereale), lentils (Lens culinaris), peas (Pisum sativum), bitter vetch (Vicia ervilia), chickpea (Cicer arietinum).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-oldest-domesticated-crop>What is the oldest domesticated crop?</h2>
<p>The discovery dates domesticated figs to a period some 5,000 years earlier than previously thought, making the fruit trees the oldest known domesticated crop.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-crops-in-the-americas-come-from>Where did the first crops in the Americas come from?</h2>
<p>The exact origin of cacao (the source of chocolate) is debated, but it may have been domesticated in South America and then introduced to the Maya some 1,500 years ago. Also known as manioc or yuca, cassava was likely domesticated 8,000–10,000 years ago in southern Brazil by ancient Amazonian peoples.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-agriculture-begin-in-the-new-world>When did agriculture begin in the New World?</h2>
<p>The first crops in eastern North America may be almost as old, but substantial evidence for crop use there begins between 5000 and 4000 bp. Corn, the crop that eventually dominated most of the agricultural systems in the New World, appears rather suddenly in Mexico between 6300 and 6000 bp but was clearly domesticated earlier than that.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-crops-did-the-colonists-grow>What kind of crops did the colonists grow?</h2>
<p>Other native crops included pumpkins, squash and beans. European wheat, barley, oats and peas were also grown. In addition to the large-field crops, family gardens in the colonies contained herbs and vegetables, such as lettuce, parsley, carrots, spinach and turnips.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-staple-crop-of-the-early-settlers>What was the staple crop of the early settlers?</h2>
<p>Various types or flavors of raw leaf tobacco were exported for use in chewing tobaccos, pipes and snuff.Corn was a major crop grown by early settlers. Also referred to as maize or Indian corn, it was a dietary staple. Corn was used as an ingredient in porridge, bread, grits and other dishes.</p>
