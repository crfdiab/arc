<h2 id=where-was-napoleon-when-he-died-in-exile>Where was Napoleon when he died in exile?</h2>
<p>Napoleon Bonaparte, the former French ruler who once ruled an empire that stretched across Europe, dies as a British prisoner on the remote island of Saint Helena in the southern Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-napoleons-doctor-at-the-time-of-his-death>Who was Napoleon’s doctor at the time of his death?</h2>
<p>Although Dr. Antommarchi remained as one of Napoleon’s physicians, Dr. Arnott, a British physician of the 20th regiment, was called to attend to Napoleon. As he too was ignorant, Dr. Arnott diagnosed Napoleon as a hypochondriac with a mental illness being “more mental than physical and not serious.”</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-napoleons-death-in-france>What was the cause of Napoleon’s death in France?</h2>
<p>Whether you are a private individual or a company, if you are a tax payer in France, you get tax benefits on donations to the Fondation Napoléon. Find out more. The dispute regarding Napoleon’s cause of death continues after 180 years because the practice of medicine was not scientific at that time.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-napoleon-when-he-attempted-suicide>How old was Napoleon when he attempted suicide?</h2>
<p>In May 1786, as a 16-year-old artillery officer with the La Fère Regiment at Valence, he wrote a short essay entitled “On Suicide.” Always alone in the midst of men, I come back to my rooms to dream with myself, and to surrender myself to all the vivacity of my melancholy.

<h2 id=how-old-was-napoleon-bonaparte-when-he-died>How old was Napoleon Bonaparte when he died?</h2>
<p>There, after a few years of loneliness, he died on May 5, 1821. But Napoleon did not go quickly — or quietly. When he dictated his will in April, he said, “I die before my time, killed by the English oligarchy and its hired assassins.” Officially, Napoleon’s death at age 51 was attributed to stomach cancer.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-napoleon-die-on-the-island-of-st-helena>Where did Napoleon die on the island of St Helena?</h2>
<p>Since his death in British custody on the island of St Helena in 1821, the claims that Napoleon Bonaparte was either murdered or spirited off the island have never completely gone away. Siân Rees examines these theories in detail, exploring the many deaths of Napoleon.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-napoleons-death-in-paris>What was the cause of Napoleons death in Paris?</h2>
<p>Six years later, he died, most likely of stomach cancer, and in 1840 his body was returned to Paris, where it was interred in the Hotel des Invalides.
