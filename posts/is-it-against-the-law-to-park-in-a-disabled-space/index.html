<h2 id=is-it-against-the-law-to-park-in-a-disabled-space>Is it against the law to park in a disabled space?</h2>
<p>To be allowed to park in a disabled bay, the car in question must display a valid disabled parking permit, or ‘Blue Badge. ‘ The ‘Blue Badge’ scheme is run by the government, and allows disabled people – or those who transport them – to avoid certain parking exemptions.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-can-you-be-chased-for-a-parking-fine>How long can you be chased for a parking fine?</h2>
<p>Parking firms can give you a notice on the spot and follow up after 28 days. Alternatively, parking firms can issue a ticket by post alone within 14 days.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-law-on-disabled-parking>What is the law on disabled parking?</h2>
<p>Under the Act, disabled people should be treated equally and protection from discrimination applies in many situations such as education, employment, exercise of public functions, goods, services, facilities and transport. It’s against the law to be treated unfairly at work because of your age.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-ignore-private-parking-ticket>Can I ignore private parking ticket?</h2>
<p>Whether you have to pay a private parking fine will depend on who it was issued by. If the fine was issued by the police or council workers, known as a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN), you can’t ignore it. This is because they’re backed by the law and if you ignore this for too long, you could get summoned to court.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-dont-pay-pcn>What happens if you dont pay PCN?</h2>
<p>You have 28 days to pay the Penalty Notice (PN). Further failure to pay the charge within 21 days can lead to the County Court issuing a warrant to civil enforcement agents (bailiffs). This will mean added charges and civil enforcement agents (bailiffs) taking goods from your home to settle the debt.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-pay-for-private-parking>Do you have to pay for private parking?</h2>
<p>Landowners such as shopping centres and supermarkets often sub- contract their parking facilities to private parking companies, who can charge for parking. If you use a private parking place you need to follow the rules of the car park and if you have broken the rules you should pay the charge.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-landlord-charge-for-a-parking-space>Can a landlord charge for a parking space?</h2>
<p>Where you are granted only ‘rights to use’ parking spaces, it is usual for the landlord to be obliged to repair the spaces (along with the rest of the car park) and to recoup the costs of that from you via the service charge.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-charge-for-parking>What does it mean to charge for parking?</h2>
<p>Under the powers of the Local Authorities (Transport Charges) Regulations, local authorities may charge for actions taken to provide amendments or exemptions to traffic management orders. Table 2 of these Regulations deals with parking operations. The regulations emphasise that the power to charge is for actions taken by the authority</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-parking-charge-notices>What do you need to know about Parking Charge Notices?</h2>
<p>What is a Parking Charge Notice? Parking Charge Notices are the result of a parking infringement on private land or in a car park which is operated by private organisations on behalf of the landowner, and are not enforced by the local highways authority or the police.</p>
