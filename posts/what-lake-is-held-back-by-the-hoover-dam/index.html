<h2 id=what-lake-is-held-back-by-the-hoover-dam>What lake is held back by the Hoover Dam?</h2>
<p>Lake Mead<br>
Hoover Dam impounds Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States by volume (when it is full). The dam is located near Boulder City, Nevada, a municipality originally constructed for workers on the construction project, about 30 mi (48 km) southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<h2 id=did-lake-mead-exist-before-the-hoover-dam>Did Lake Mead exist before the Hoover Dam?</h2>
<p>In 1936, the completion of Hoover Dam on the Colorado River in Nevada and Arizona created Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States. The construction of Hoover Dam and the filling of Lake Mead erased much of that history.</p>
<h2 id=did-anyone-die-during-the-construction-of-hoover-dam>Did anyone die during the construction of Hoover Dam?</h2>
<p>The “official” number of fatalities involved in building Hoover Dam is 96. These were men who died at the dam site (classified as “industrial fatalities”) from such causes as drowning, blasting, falling rocks or slides, falls from the canyon walls, being struck by heavy equipment, truck accidents, etc.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-water-does-the-hoover-dam-hold-back>How much water does the Hoover Dam hold back?</h2>
<p>The top of the dam is more than 1,200 feet long. At the base, it is an amazing 660 feet thick and at the top it is 45 feet thick. The water on the lake side is more than 500 feet deep, and the lake holds a total of 10 trillion or so gallons of water—enough water to cover a state like Connecticut 10 feet deep.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-hoover-dam-curve-against-lake-mead>Why does the Hoover Dam curve against Lake Mead?</h2>
<p>It’s answered briefly this way. Hoover Dam curves against Lake Mead and is fortified against the massive rock walls of Black Canyon. When the water compresses against the curved walls of Hoover Dam, the canyon walls push-back counteracting the awesome power of Lake Mead.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-hoover-dam-in-las-vegas>Where was the Hoover Dam in Las Vegas?</h2>
<p>When it was built in the 1930s, the Hoover Dam didn’t just tame the Colorado River – it also created a massive lake that today hides shipwrecks, train tracks and cement tunnels alike. Beneath the surface of Lake Mead, located 35 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, a world unfolds in shades of teal.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-water-shortage-at-hoover-dam>Why is there water shortage at Hoover Dam?</h2>
<p>Long before the end of the world, climate concerns present a much more real problem for the power plant. The waters of Lake Mead feed the plant, but water levels have fallen in recent years. The waters of Lake Mead have fallen over the area’s 21-year drought. Credit: Ana Filipa Neves. Water shortages are nothing new in the Western US.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-to-build-the-hoover-dam>How long did it take to build the Hoover Dam?</h2>
<p>The amount of concrete used in building it was enough to pave a road stretching from San Francisco to New York City. Although the dam would take only five years to build, its construction was nearly 30 years in the making.</p>
