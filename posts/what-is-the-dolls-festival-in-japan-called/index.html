<p>Hina Matsuri<br>
All About Hina Matsuri: The Epic Japanese Doll Festival (March 3) Every March 3 in Japan is Hinamatsuri, a special holiday set aside to commemorate the growth, happiness, and prosperity of young girls.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-japanese-celebrate-doll-festival>How do Japanese celebrate Doll Festival?</h2>
<p>To celebrate, people follow the tradition of setting up red carpeted materials being used to display ornamental dolls, as well as floating dolls down the river. The plateaus represent the Emperor, Empress, attendants, and musicians in traditional court dress of the Heian period.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-date-of-japans-national-doll-festival>What is the date of Japan’s National Doll Festival?</h2>
<p>March 3rd<br>
Every year on March 3rd, Japan celebrates the Doll Festival (Japanese, Hina Matsuri). Until recently, Girls’ Day was also celebrated on March 3rd. On this day every year, families set up a special step-altar on which to arrange their Emperor and Empress dolls, called “hina” in Japanese.</p>

<p>It’s very human and despite how silly the anime can be, the show contains episodes that are tearjerking. It’s a comedy show and definitely never forgets its intentions. The music also makes certain scenes and montages feel more meaningful. Ah, if only Hinamatsuri had more than 12 episodes.</p>
<h2 id=is-hinamatsuri-romance-anime>Is Hinamatsuri romance anime?</h2>
<p>Every story, every scene, and every episode is predicated on the love amongst people. Unlike a lot of slice of life series, HINAMATSURI doesn’t rely on lazily established romances as ‘love’. The love in this series is a kind of general goodwill that all people can understand.</p>
