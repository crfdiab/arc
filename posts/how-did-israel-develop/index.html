<h2 id=how-did-israel-develop>How did Israel develop?</h2>
<p>Modern Israel has its origins in the Zionism movement, established in the late 19th century by Jews in the Russian Empire who called for the establishment of a territorial Jewish state after enduring persecution.

<p>Israel is a young country and one advantage of being a young country is that it doesn’t have long traditions, especially when it comes to agriculture.
