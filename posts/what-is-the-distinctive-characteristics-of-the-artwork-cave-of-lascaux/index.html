<h2 id=what-is-the-distinctive-characteristics-of-the-artwork-cave-of-lascaux>What is the distinctive characteristics of the artwork cave of Lascaux?</h2>
<p>Lascaux is famous for its Palaeolithic cave paintings, found in a complex of caves in the Dordogne region of southwestern France, because of their exceptional quality, size, sophistication and antiquity. Estimated to be up to 20,000 years old, the paintings consist primarily of large animals, once native to the region.</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-were-painted-in-the-cave-of-lascaux>What animals were painted in the cave of Lascaux?</h2>
<p>Although there is one human image (painted representations of humans are very rare in Paleolithic art; sculpted human forms are more common), most of the paintings depict animals found in the surrounding landscape, such as horses, bison, mammoths, ibex, aurochs, deer, lions, bears, and wolves.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-animals-painted-in-caves>Why were animals painted in caves?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the cave man wanted to decorate the cave and chose animals because they were important to their existence. The second theory could have been that they considered this magic to help the hunters. Prehistoric man could have used the painting of animals on the walls of caves to document their hunting expeditions.</p>

<h2 id=what-can-we-learn-from-cave-paintings>What can we learn from cave paintings?</h2>
<p>By studying paintings from the Cave of Lascaux (France) and the Blombos Cave (South Africa), students discover that pictures are more than pretty colors and representations of things we recognize: they are also a way of communicating beliefs and ideas.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-lascaux-cave-paintings-so-famous>Why are the Lascaux cave paintings so famous?</h2>
<p>Lascaux’s cave paintings are famous because of their exceptional quality, size, sophistication and antiquity. Estimated to be more than 17,000 years old, the paintings consist primarily of large animals, once native to the region. They are among the finest examples of art from the Upper Paleolithic period.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-animals-are-in-the-lascaux-caves>How many animals are in the Lascaux caves?</h2>
<p>The paintings identified as animals are 900 pieces. The 90 paintings are stags. The 364 paintings are equines. The 4 to 5 percent of the paintings are bison and cattle. A human, a rhinoceros, a bear, a bird and seven felines are the other paintings.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-black-aurochs-in-lascaux-cave>How big is the black aurochs in Lascaux cave?</h2>
<p>Many of the animals were painted with stunning accuracy and the use of three dimensional aspects. There are also odd symbols, including dots and connected rectangles. The latter could represent some sort of a trap which was used in hunting these animals. The black aurochs is around 17 feet (5 meters) in size.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-reindeer-in-the-lascaux-caves>Are there any reindeer in the Lascaux caves?</h2>
<p>However, the caves do not feature any reindeer painting. The Hall of the Bulls is considered as the most prominent part of the caves where you can spot stags, equines and bulls.</p>
