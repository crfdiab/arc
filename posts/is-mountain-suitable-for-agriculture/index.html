<h2 id=is-mountain-suitable-for-agriculture>Is Mountain suitable for agriculture?</h2>
<p>Yet, mountains contain more diversity than plain regions: their varied landscapes and the changes in altitude have created a multitude of agro-ecological zones. The genetic variety of agricultural crops and farm animals contained in these zones has the potential to provide diversified and nutritious food for all.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-farming-in-the-mountains-different-from-farming-in-the-plains>How is farming in the mountains different from farming in the plains?</h2>
<p>Explanation: Agriculture in plains are more easy than agriculture in the hilly slopes . In the hilly slopes the essential nutrients of the soil easily gets carried away with the water due to its steep land forms. In the mountains generally terrace farming is done .</p>
<h2 id=what-is-grown-in-the-mountains>What is grown in the mountains?</h2>
<p>Root vegetables: carrots, beets, radishes, turnips, kohlrabi, rutabaga, potatoes, leeks; Other vegetables: peas, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts; Herbs: reliably hardy perennial herbs include French tarragon, horseradish, some mints, and chives.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-farm-on-mountains>Why do people farm on mountains?</h2>
<p>Most of their production is for family consumption, playing a key role in ensuring household food security. In addition, family farms in mountains help shape mountain landscapes, provid- ing ecosystem services that are vital for development far beyond mountain areas.</p>
<h2 id=which-type-of-farming-is-most-suitable-in-the-hills>Which type of farming is most suitable in the hills?</h2>
<p>Terrace farming is suitable in hilly areas.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-farming-kept-alive-in-mountainous-areas>How is farming kept alive in mountainous areas?</h2>
<p>On the contrary, in these areas, agriculture is central. “Mountains are kept alive only through agriculture, it’s integral to country life,” said Hubert Ungerer, who is responsible for an EU-financed project called LaugenRind, set up in response to the milk crisis.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-more-demanding-farming-or-mountain-farming>Which is more demanding farming or mountain farming?</h2>
<p>SPECIAL REPORT / There is one type of agriculture that is more demanding and laboursome than others, but essential from a social point of view, and that is mountain farming. EURACTIV Italy reports. The EU has ranked them among the most “disadvantaged areas” for agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-accessibility-an-issue-in-mountain-farming>How is accessibility an issue in mountain farming?</h2>
<p>Accessibility is a key issue in mountain farming, especially in developing countries. This is not only limited to farm inputs – it includes access to basic infrastructures such as health services, schools, roads, transport, markets and communication with the rest of the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-mountain-farming-deserve-special-attention-in-a-zero-hunger-context>Why does mountain farming deserve special attention in a Zero Hunger context?</h2>
<p>In mountain areas, family farming often remains a last resort occupation while, under the right conditions, it could become the backbone of sustainable development. Why does mountain agriculture deserve special attention in a Zero Hunger context? Firstly, because hunger remains common in many mountainous areas.</p>
