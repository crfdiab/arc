<h2 id=what-does-yin-and-yang-represent>What does yin and yang represent?</h2>
<p>yinyang, Wade-Giles romanization yin-yang, Japanese in-yō, in Eastern thought, the two complementary forces that make up all aspects and phenomena of life. Yin is a symbol of earth, femaleness, darkness, passivity, and absorption. Yang is conceived of as heaven, maleness, light, activity, and penetration.</p>
<h2 id=which-way-is-the-yin-yang-symbol>Which way is the yin-yang symbol?</h2>
<p>However, the two lower T’ai-Chi symbols (labeled upside-down) have yin (dark) at the top and yang (light) at the bottom.</p>
<h2 id=what-taijitu-means>What taijitu means?</h2>
<p>Taijitu. Taijitu is a term which refers to a Chinese symbol for the concept of yin and yang. It is the universal symbol of the religion known as Taoism and is also often used by non-Taoists to represent the concept of opposites existing in harmony. The taijitu consists of a rotated pattern inside a circle.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-yin-yang-called>What is yin-yang called?</h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, the “yin and yang symbol”, itself popularly called taijitu, represents the second of these five parts of the diagram. In some diagrams, there is a smaller empty circle at the center of this, representing Emptiness as the foundation of duality.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-complementary-force>Which is an example of a complementary force?</h2>
<p>These forces include the balance of subjectivity and objectivity, weaknesses and strengths, problems and opportunities, creation and destruction, conflict and cooperation, unity and focus, ground and climate, costs and benefits, decisions and actions, opponents and supporters, facts and opinions, advantages and disadvantages, and many more.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-complementary-opposites-related-to-one-another>How are complementary opposites related to one another?</h2>
<p>Complementary opposites are not simply two separate forces in opposition to one another. They are two halves of a single system, two sides of the same coin. One creates and feeds the other in an endless cycle, like breathing out and breathing in. Each half of the system is necessary and indispensable to the other.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-value-of-complementary-opposites-in-competition>What is the value of complementary opposites in competition?</h2>
<p>The value of complementary opposites is that the concept teaches us to leverage natural forces instead of fighting against them. In seeing the balance of the forces in competition, we avoid the mistake of seeing one half of the system as good and the other opposing half as bad.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-sun-tzu-say-about-complementary-opposites>What does Sun Tzu say about complementary opposites?</h2>
<p>Seemingly opposite forces are actually two necessary sides of the same system. Sun Tzu references thirty-two different such pairs of opposing forces at work in competitive situations. Each provides a point of comparison among alternatives.</p>
