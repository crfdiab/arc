<h2 id=how-many-dogs-can-you-legally-own-in-washington-state>How many dogs can you legally own in Washington state?</h2>
<p>No more than three small animals such as dogs and cats (unless your property is over 20,000 square feet) Up to eight domestic fowl (more for lots over 10,000 square feet) are allowed, but no roosters.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-have-goats-in-spokane>Can you have goats in Spokane?</h2>
<p>Per Spokane city law, residents can raise one small goat, sheep, or pig per 2,500 square feet of land, and one chicken per 1,000 feet. So, if you have a 5,000 square foot total lot you can have five chickens, or two livestock, or a combination like Janice Swagerty.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-have-chickens-in-spokane-city-limits>Can you have chickens in Spokane city limits?</h2>
<p>For chickens and small livestock the ordinance allows for one chicken per 1,000 square feet. For every 2,500 square feet, you can have one small livestock. So, if you have a 5,000 square foot lot you could have five chickens, or two small livestock or one small livestock and two chickens.</p>
<h2 id=can-scraps-take-my-dog>Can scraps take my dog?</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that if you feed your dog a complete, balanced commercial diet, adding anything that isn’t complete and balanced can throw your pet’s diet out of whack. So, in general, you shouldn’t feed your dog table scraps. Dogs love baby carrots, celery, and even bits of vegetables you wouldn’t think they’d like.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-bury-my-dog-in-my-backyard-in-washington-state>Can I bury my dog in my backyard in Washington state?</h2>
<p>Washington State law requires that “a person disposing of a dead animal by burial must place it so that every part is covered by at least three feet of soil; at a location not less than one hundred feet from any well, spring, stream or other surface waters; not in a low-lying area subject to seasonal flooding or within …</p>
<h2 id=can-you-breed-dogs-in-wa>Can you breed dogs in WA?</h2>
<p>Proposed new laws and changes to the Dog Act 1976 Currently the breeding of dogs in Western Australia is unregulated, allowing irresponsible breeders and puppy farmers to breed and supply dogs indiscriminately.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-pets-can-you-have-in-spokane>How many pets can you have in Spokane?</h2>
<p>four dogs<br>
Numbers: Within the City of Spokane, an individual may have no more than a combined total of four dogs and/or cats over the age of six months.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-have-a-pig-in-spokane-valley>Can I have a pig in Spokane Valley?</h2>
<p>Pigs are not permitted, and coops, hutches and other animal buildings must be set back 75 feet from dwellings. In the city of Spokane, one chicken is allowed per 1,000-square-foot lot and one small livestock per 2,500-square-foot lot.</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-can-you-have-in-spokane-city-limits>What animals can you have in Spokane city limits?</h2>
<p>Three large animals (cows or horses) or six medium animals (goats) are allowed per acre, and one small animal, like a rabbit, is permitted per 3,000 square feet of lot. Pigs are not permitted, and coops, hutches and other animal buildings must be set back 75 feet from dwellings.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-dogs-who-eat-table-scraps>What happens to dogs who eat table scraps?</h2>
<p>It Can Cause Digestive Problems A dog’s digestive system is different from a human’s. Typical human food is much too rich and fatty for a dog to properly digest; eating it can lead to vomiting, diarrhea and even more severe conditions like pancreatitis.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-table-scraps-bad-for-dogs>Why are table scraps bad for dogs?</h2>
<p>Toxin Exposure. While it may be well-intentioned, treating pets to tables scraps can lead to them ingest toxic foods. Human foods that contain raisins, grapes, chocolate, xylitol (a sugar substitute seen often in gum and candies) and onions can all be toxic.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-license-to-own-a-dog-in-spokane>Do you need a license to own a dog in Spokane?</h2>
<p>In Spokane County, a private kennel license is required for someone to own 5-10 dogs; a commercial kennel license is required for someone to own 11 or more dogs. Requiring individual dogs to be licensed is a good idea. Those little metal tags reunite lost pets with their owners…</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-animal-laws-in-spokane-county-wa>What are the animal laws in Spokane County WA?</h2>
<p>Spokane County Animal Laws – Spokane County Code, Chapter 5: Animals at Large: Dogs must be kept on their owners’/guardians’ properties and, when on public property, be leashed (on a leash no longer than eight feet in length) at all times.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-restrictions-on-how-many-dogs-you-can-own>Are there any restrictions on how many dogs you can own?</h2>
<p>Some contend that these restrictions affect the legitimate breeding and training of show dogs as well as dog rescue facilities. In 1999 in Rideland , South Carolina , pet owners helped nix a municipal plan to limit pet ownership to only two dogs, after a number of concerned pet owners appeared at the City Council meeting.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-ordinances-that-limit-the-number-of-pets>Are there ordinances that limit the number of pets?</h2>
<p>Ordinances regulating pet ownership usually regulate based on numerical criteria. An ordinance that chooses to limit the number of pets to a certain number (i.e., three dogs per household) will be generally upheld even if it fails to distinguish dogs based on other factors (i.e., size or weight).</p>
