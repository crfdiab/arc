<h2 id=what-was-a-farmers-life-like-in-ancient-egypt>What was a farmers life like in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Farmers lived in houses made of mud bricks. Windows were built high up to give privacy and to help heat escape. Floors were made out of packed dirt. Farmers cooked food in small ovens fueled by burning dried cattle dung.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-farmers-farm-in-ancient-egypt>How did farmers farm in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Most farming that we are familiar with requires the use of ploughs to turn the soil to bring up nutrient rich soil upwards. The Egyptians had little ploughing to do because the flooding of the Nile deposited all of the rich soil directly on top.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-joseph-serve-in-egypt>Who did Joseph serve in Egypt?</h2>
<p>Joseph was one of Jacob’s 12 sons. His father loved him more than any of the others and gave him a coloured cloak. His brothers were jealous of him and sold him into slavery. He was taken to Egypt and eventually became steward to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials.</p>

<h2 id=what-did-your-father-do-in-ancient-egypt>What did your father do in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>In ancient Egypt, for the most part, whatever job your father had, you had. If he was a farmer, mostly probably, when you grew up, you would become a farmer. If he was a soldier, most probably, that was your future as well.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-ancient-egyptians-keep-their-plants-from-drying-up>How did the ancient Egyptians keep their plants from drying up?</h2>
<p>In ancient Egypt almost no rain, to prevent the plants from drying, farmers in ancient Egypt dug small channels that filled with water from the Nile. Until the New Kingdom, they used pitchers, later they invented the Shadoof, an instrument still used today, formed by a crowbar with a container on one side and a counterweight on the other.</p>

<p>Ancient Egypt for Kids Farming & Farmers. If he was a farmer, mostly probably, when you grew up, you would become a farmer. If he was a soldier, most probably, that was your future as well. In ancient Egypt, jobs were inherited. Farmers divided planned their time around 3 seasons – the flooding season, the growing season, and the harvest season.</p>
