<h2 id=what-are-the-3-most-important-components-of-the-canadian-constitution>What are the 3 most important components of the Canadian Constitution?</h2>
<p>The Constitution sets out the basic principles of democratic government in Canada when it defines the powers of the three branches of government: the executive. the legislative. the judiciary.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-purpose-of-the-canadian-constitution>What is the main purpose of the Canadian Constitution?</h2>
<p>The Constitution of Canada (French: Constitution du Canada) is the supreme law in Canada. It outlines Canada’s system of government and the civil and human rights of those who are citizens of Canada and non-citizens in Canada.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-when-the-canadian-constitution-was-repatriated-in-1982>What happened when the Canadian Constitution was repatriated in 1982?</h2>
<p>In 1982, Canada fully broke from its colonial past and “patriated” its Constitution. It transferred the country’s highest law, the British North America Act (which was renamed the Constitution Act, 1867), from the authority of the British Parliament to Canada’s federal and provincial legislatures.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-section-92-of-the-canadian-constitution>What is Section 92 of the Canadian Constitution?</h2>
<p>Section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 sets out the provincial heads of power. Generally, matters affecting a single province fall under provincial jurisdiction; examples include taxation in a province, the establishment and tenure of public officials in a province and the incorporation of companies in a province.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-10-constitutional-rights>What are the 10 constitutional Rights?</h2>
<p>Bill of Rights – The Really Brief Version</p>
<table><tr><th>1</th><th>Freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition.</th></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Right of trial by jury in civil cases.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Freedom from excessive bail, cruel and unusual punishments.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Other rights of the people.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Powers reserved to the states.</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-important-type-of-law-in-canada>What is the most important type of law in Canada?</h2>
<p>The Canadian constitution is the set of rules that define the powers of the government and the rights of the people. The Charter lists Canadians’ most important rights and freedoms. The constitution, which includes the Charter, is the highest law in Canada.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-amendments-11-27>What are Amendments 11 27?</h2>
<p>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-notwithstanding-clause-in-the-canadian-constitution>What was the notwithstanding clause in the Canadian constitution?</h2>
<p>Under the notwithstanding clause, the federal Parliament or the provincial legislatures can exempt any law from certain Charter provisions. The second part guarantees the existing rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, though these are left undefined.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-canada-come-up-with-its-constitution>How did Canada come up with its constitution?</h2>
<p>The federal government’s unilateral move was found, ironically, to be legal but conventionally unconstitutional. This led to a meeting of the first ministers in November 1981, where nine of the provinces and the federal government came to a compromise, with only Quebec rejecting the provisions.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-constitution-act-of-1867-do-for-canada>What did the Constitution Act of 1867 do for Canada?</h2>
<p>This Act, also known as the Constitution Act, 1867, founded Canada as a nation. It made elected governments the highest political and legal institutions in the country. The Constitution distributed power between the federal and provincial governments.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-constitution-act-of-1982-do-for-canada>What did the Constitution Act of 1982 do for Canada?</h2>
<p>Thanks for contributing to The Canadian Encyclopedia. The Constitution Act, 1982 is a landmark document in Canadian history. It achieved full independence for Canada by allowing the country to change its Constitution without approval from Britain.</p>
