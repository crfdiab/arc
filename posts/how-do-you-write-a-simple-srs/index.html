<li>Get Approval for the SRS.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-are-the-contents-of-srs>What are the contents of SRS?</h2>
<p>This includes the purpose, scope, functional and nonfunctional requirements, software and hardware requirements of the project. In addition to this, it also contains the information about environmental conditions required, safety and security requirements, software quality attributes of the project etc.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-srs-which-qualities-are-requires-for-srs>What is SRS which qualities are requires for SRS?</h2>
<p>Following are the characteristics of a good SRS document:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id=what-is-hotel-management-system-project>What is hotel management system project?</h2>
<p>The project, Hotel Management System is a web-based application that allows the hotel manager to handle all hotel activities online. Hotel management project provides room booking, staff management and other necessary hotel management features. The system allows the manager to post available rooms in the system.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-srs-format>What is SRS format?</h2>
<p>Software Requirement Specification (SRS) Format as name suggests, is complete specification and description of requirements of software that needs to be fulfilled for successful development of software system. These requirements can be functional as well as non-requirements depending upon type of requirement.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-srs-document>What is the purpose of SRS document?</h2>
<p>In short, the purpose of this SRS document is to provide a detailed overview of our software product, its parameters and goals. This document describes the project’s target audience and its user interface, hardware and software requirements.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-of-srs-document>What are the advantages of SRS document?</h2>
<p>Advantages of good SRS Document</p>
<ul>
<li>An SRS establishes the basis for agreement between the customer and the supplier on what the software product will perform.</li>
<li>An SRS provides a reference for validation of the final product/software.</li>
<li>A high-quality SRS is a prerequisite to high-quality product/software.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-the-attributes-of-bad-srs-document>What are the attributes of bad SRS document?</h2>
<p>A bad SRS will exhibit the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not defining all failure modes and protection requirements:-</li>
<li>Not defining all operating regimes, start-up, shut-down.</li>
<li>Not defining all environmental conditions.</li>
<li>SRS not maintained (poor revision control)</li>
<li>Conflicting or missing requirements:-</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=which-is-true-for-srs>Which is true for SRS?</h2>
<p>Which is true for SRS? Explanation: SRS is main output of the software product design process and vice versa. Explanation: Developer’s requirements are not necessary and also non technical one.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-hotel-management>What are the disadvantages of hotel management?</h2>
<p>What are the disadvantages of hotel management?</p>
<ul>
<li>If one staff mistypes the information than the guest might get angry.</li>
<li>If there is a power failure, while making a reservation than the staff must redo the whole reservation.</li>
