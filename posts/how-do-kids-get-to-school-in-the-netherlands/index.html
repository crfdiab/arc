<h2 id=how-do-kids-get-to-school-in-the-netherlands>How do kids get to school in the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>Since there are almost no private schools in the Netherlands, almost all Dutch kids go to a public or semi-public school. Therefore, most children can walk or bike to school. Furthermore, sending your kids to a Dutch school means that they will learn the language very quickly and integrate into Dutch society easily.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-year-10-in-the-netherlands>What is Year 10 in The Netherlands?</h2>
<p>In The Netherlands, the 10th grade (based on the level of compulsory secondary education) is the last (VMBO), second to last (HAVO), or fourth out of six (VWO) grades of high school.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-school-cost-in-netherlands>How much does school cost in Netherlands?</h2>
<p>The tuition fee in the Netherlands for the European Union (EU) students is about 1800-4000 Euros each year while Netherlands university fees for international students is about 6000-20000 Euros each year.</p>
<h2 id=is-7-a-good-grade-in-the-netherlands>Is 7 a good grade in the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>7 = More than satisfactory It’s a good and solid result, and it is the most commonly awarded grade in the Netherlands. It can be officially translated into meaning ‘more than satisfactory’, but most students will agree that a 7 is actually ‘more than enough’.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-go-to-school-in-the-netherlands>How long does it take to go to school in the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>Primary education is eight years long and divided into eight levels (groups 1–8). In the Netherlands, it is mandatory for children to attend school from five years of age, but many children start at four. If you want your child to start school at five, they will be admitted into group 2. In some schools, groups 1 and 2 are merged.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-teach-english-in-the-netherlands>How old do you have to be to teach English in the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>By law, Dutch schools have to start teaching English as a subject by group 7 (about age 10) at the latest. More and more schools have decided to start earlier, sometimes from group 1. Such schools are VVTO schools, which refers to Early Foreign Language Education. Seventeen schools in the Netherlands are official bilingual pilot schools.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-kids-go-to-preschool-in-the-netherlands>When do kids go to preschool in the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>In most cities, preschool ( voorschool) starts at age 2, and is offered for an average of 15 hours per week, spread out over three days. Usually preschool is more structured than daycare and they prepare the preschool children for primary school in a playful way, according to a designated program.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-dutch-schools-go-on-summer-holidays>When do Dutch schools go on summer holidays?</h2>
<p>Other conditions are that the leave is intended for a family holiday, is for a maximum period of 10 days and must not occur in the first two weeks after the summer holidays. These are this year’s advised school holidays for primary and secondary schools in the Netherlands:</p>
