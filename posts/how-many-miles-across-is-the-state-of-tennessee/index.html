<h2 id=how-many-miles-across-is-the-state-of-tennessee>How many miles across is the state of Tennessee?</h2>
<p>Tennessee became the 16th state of the union in 1796. It is just 112 miles wide, but stretches 432 miles from the Appalachian Mountains boundary with North Carolina in the east to the Mississippi River borders with Missouri and Arkansas in the west.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-drive-through-the-tennessee-safari-park>How long does it take to drive through the Tennessee Safari park?</h2>
<p>The drive through alone takes at least 1 hour to go through the park, depending on the time of year, many visitors spend an hour as well in the walk through section. So to tour the entire park, most visitors are here from 2-2.5 hours.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-drive-through-kentucky-from-north-to-south>How long does it take to drive through Kentucky from north to south?</h2>
<p>The total distance of the i-75 across the state of Kentucky is approx. 192 miles long, which requires an approx. driving time of 3 hours and 12 minutes to complete when driving an average speed of 60 miles per hour.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-into-the-tennessee-safari-park>How much does it cost to get into the Tennessee Safari Park?</h2>
<p>Admission is $16 for adults, $12 for children 2-12 and free for children 1 and under.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-go-to-the-safari-park>How much does it cost to go to the safari park?</h2>
<p>San Diego Zoo Safari Park Regular Gate Prices Please note: San Diego Zoo Safari Park charges a $1.00 fee per ticket for online orders. 1-Day Pass is $62 per adult (age 12 and up) and $52 per child (age 3-11) and includes admission plus the African Tram and Cheetah Run (if available).</p>
<h2 id=is-kentucky-hilly-or-flat>Is Kentucky hilly or flat?</h2>
<p>Kentucky is very, very hilly. Michigan is as flat as a pancake. No, there aren’t mountains everywhere in Kentucky, but hear me out: You can’t ride your bike to work even on the western side without getting sore knees and thighs and running out of breath when you’re only about one fourth of the way there.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-tennessee-from-me>How long does it take to get to Tennessee from me?</h2>
<p>This depends on how many miles Tennessee is from your current location, and takes into account average driving times with traffic and highways or local roads. How long does it take to fly?</p>
<h2 id=how-to-calculate-the-driving-distance-from-tennessee>How to calculate the driving distance from Tennessee?</h2>
<p>Enter the “Distance From” city, village, town, airport or place name from Tennessee (US) in the “Distance From” (first) text box. Enter the “Distance To” city, village, town, airport or place name from Tennessee (US) in the “Distance To” (second) text box. You can also enter airport name or code from Tennessee (US) in above fields.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-drive-across-the-usa>How long does it take to drive across the USA?</h2>
<p>Depending on which route you go on, a road trip across the USA will take between four and six days, assuming you’re willing to spend up to eight hours behind the wheel per day. If you’d rather limit driving time and spend a bit more time at stops, the journey can take anywhere between a week and a month – or even longer!</p>
<h2 id=where-to-go-on-a-road-trip-in-tennessee>Where to go on a road trip in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>Montgomery Bell State Park in bucolic Burns (exit 182, Fairview) is a 40-minute drive west—and a world away—from the bright lights of Nashville. Spend the morning in the park hiking; canoeing, kayaking, or boating (seasonal rentals available) on one of its three lakes; or golfing the par-71, 18-hole course.</p>
