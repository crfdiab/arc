<h2 id=did-the-pope-give-ireland-to-england>Did the pope give Ireland to England?</h2>
<p>Thereupon the pope excommunicated William. Adrian then marched to Benevento, during which time he received John of Salisbury, secretary to the archbishop of Canterbury, and granted him the Donation of Ireland (known as the bull Laudabiliter), which supposedly gave Ireland to Henry II of England.</p>
<h2 id=who-gave-ireland-to-england>Who gave Ireland to England?</h2>
<p>The bishop of this Italian see, 25 miles southwest of Rome, was not Italian, though. His name was Nicholas Breakspear. The new pope had been born 54 years earlier in or near St. Alban’s, in the county of Hertfordshire, England, where he was given the name Nicholas by his commoner father, Robert Breakspear,.</p>
<h2 id=which-pope-was-from-england>Which pope was from England?</h2>
<p>Adrian IV<br>
Born Nicholas Breakspear in about 1100 at Abbots Langley, near St Albans, he was the son of an educated but poor man. “He rose from almost nothing to become Pope, and he did it all on his talents,” said historian Anne Duggan, co-editor of Adrian IV, The English Pope.</p>
<h2 id=which-english-king-invaded-ireland>Which English king invaded Ireland?</h2>
<p>King Henry II<br>
In 1155 he granted King Henry II the right to invade Ireland to put manners on the wayward Irish church. MacMurrough was suitably obsequious in invoking the support of Henry II, then the most powerful monarch in Europe, to get his kingdom back.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-pope-back-william-of-orange>Did the pope back William of Orange?</h2>
<p>AN often forgotten fact about the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 was that the Pope of the day supported the Protestant King William of Orange against the Catholic King James II.</p>
<h2 id=has-there-ever-been-an-irish-pope>Has there ever been an Irish pope?</h2>
<p>Even Britain has had a pope (Adrian IV, in the mid-12th century*). But no Irish pope to speak of. We didn’t have an Irish cardinal until 1866 [Cardinal Paul Cullen], and there was no Irish saint canonized for hundreds of years before St. Oliver Plunkett in 1975.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-last-irish-pope>Who was the last Irish pope?</h2>
<p>Pope Adrian IV<br>
Most famously, in 1158 Adrian is supposed to have granted Henry the papal bull Laudabiliter, which is thought to have authorised Henry to invade Ireland….</p>

<h2 id=who-was-the-only-polish-pope>Who was the only Polish pope?</h2>
<p>Born Karol Józef Wojtyla on May 18, 1920, in Wadowice, Poland, Pope John Paul II’s early life was marked by great loss.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-pope-give-to-william-in-1066>What did the Pope give to William in 1066?</h2>
<p>This banner was personally blessed and sent to William by Pope Alexander II, the head of the Church to which all Christians belonged. William had got it by persuading the Pope that King Harold Godwinson was an oath-breaker, and by promising to modernise the old-fashioned Anglo-Saxon Church if he won.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-pope-who-gave-the-king-of-england-permission-to-invade-ireland>Who was the pope who gave the King of England permission to invade Ireland?</h2>
<p>The controversial pope who gave the King of England permission to invade Ireland. Pope Adrian IV is one of the most controversial popes for the Irish.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-most-controversial-pope-in-irish-history>Who was the most controversial pope in Irish history?</h2>
<p>Pope Adrian IV is one of the most controversial popes for the Irish. He issued the “Laudabiliter” or as it is better known “Bull,” which gave Henry II the Pope’s permission to invade Ireland “for the correction of morals and the introduction of virtues,…</p>

<p>Pope Adrian IV, born Nicholas Breakspear, is the only Englishman to have been pope. (Photo by The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) Henry’s attention soon turned to England’s neighbouring island, Ireland. In 1155, the only ever English pope, Adrian IV, issued a papal ‘bull’ entitled Laudabiliter.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-king-henry-ii-give-ireland-to-the-english>Why did King Henry II give Ireland to the English?</h2>
<p>The year after his accession, Adrian issued a “Bull,” or “Laudabiliter,” that authorized English King Henry II, who had petitioned him for it, the right to invade Ireland “for the correction of morals and the introduction of virtues, for the advancement of the Christian religion.”</p>
