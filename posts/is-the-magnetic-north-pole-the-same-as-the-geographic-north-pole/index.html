<h2 id=is-the-magnetic-north-pole-the-same-as-the-geographic-north-pole>Is the Magnetic North Pole the same as the Geographic North Pole?</h2>
<p>A magnetic compass does not point to the geographic north pole. A magnetic compass points to the earth’s magnetic poles, which are not the same as earth’s geographic poles. Furthermore, the magnetic pole near earth’s geographic north pole is actually the south magnetic pole. When it comes to magnets, opposites attract.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-north-pole-magnetic>Is the North Pole magnetic?</h2>
<p>The geomagnetic north pole, a related point, is the pole of an ideal dipole model of the Earth’s magnetic field that most closely fits the Earth’s actual magnetic field. The north magnetic pole moves over time according to magnetic changes and flux lobe elongation in the Earth’s outer core.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-north-pole-of-a-magnet-also-called>What is the North Pole of a magnet also called?</h2>
<p>The north-seeking pole of such a magnet, or any similar pole, is called a north magnetic pole. The south-seeking pole, or any pole similar to it, is called a south magnetic pole. Unlike poles of different magnets attract each other; like poles repel each other.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-magnetic-north-pole>Why is the Magnetic North Pole?</h2>
<p>The data showed that the position of the north magnetic pole is determined largely by a balance, or tug-of-war, between two large lobes of negative flux at the boundary between Earth’s core and mantle under Canada.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-north-magnetic-pole-point-on-the-earth>Where does the North Magnetic Pole point on the Earth?</h2>
<p>The North Magnetic Pole is a wandering point on the surface of Earth’s Northern Hemisphere at which the planet’s magnetic field points vertically downwards (in other words, if a magnetic compass needle is allowed to rotate about a horizontal axis, it will point straight down).</p>
<h2 id=is-the-south-pole-near-the-north-pole>Is the South Pole near the North Pole?</h2>
<p>Therefore the earth’s south magnetic pole is located near the geographic north pole and is called the magnetic north pole. (However, we sometimes mistakenly call it the magnetic north pole because the north pole of our magnets point to it. Confusing, isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-north-pole-called-the-true-north-pole>Why is the North Pole called the True North Pole?</h2>
<p>It is called the True North Pole to distinguish from the Magnetic North Pole . The North Pole is the northernmost point on the Earth, lying diametrically opposite the South Pole.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-true-north-of-the-earth>Which is the true north of the Earth?</h2>
<p>Geographic north (also called “true north”) is the direction towards the fixed point we call the North Pole. Magnetic north is the direction towards the north magnetic pole, which is a wandering point where the Earth’s magnetic field goes vertically down into the planet.</p>
