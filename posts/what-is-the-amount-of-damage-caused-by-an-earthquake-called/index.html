<h2 id=what-is-the-amount-of-damage-caused-by-an-earthquake-called>What is the amount of damage caused by an earthquake called?</h2>
<p>The effect of an earthquake on the Earth’s surface is called the intensity. The intensity scale consists of a series of certain key responses such as people awakening, movement of furniture, damage to chimneys, and finally–total destruction.</p>
<h2 id=what-damage-is-caused-by-earthquakes>What damage is caused by earthquakes?</h2>
<p>The damage caused by earthquakes is from ground shaking, ground rupture, landslides, tsunamis, and liquefaction. Earthquake damage from fires is the most important secondary effect.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-property-damage-do-earthquakes-cause-a-year>How much property damage do earthquakes cause a year?</h2>
<p>Earthquakes are estimated to cost the nation $6.1 billion annually in building stock losses according to an updated report published today by FEMA. Earthquakes are estimated to cost the nation $6.1 billion annually in building stock losses according to an updated report published today by FEMA.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-damage-caused-by-an-earthquake-measured>How is the damage caused by an earthquake measured?</h2>
<p>This is a logarithmic scale. The amount of damage caused by an earthquake is measured by the Mercalli Scale. This is a measure of intensity, and changes according to which area you are measuring – damage nearer the epicentre would usually be greater than further away.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-secondary-effects-of-an-earthquake>What are the secondary effects of an earthquake?</h2>
<p>That doesn’t bode well for any structures on the surface. Secondary effects: Earthquakes can trigger landslides, fires, floods or tsunamis. It was not the 2004 Sumatran-Andaman earthquake that caused so much damage in 2004 but the Indian Ocean tsunami it triggered.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-killed-in-an-earthquake>How many people are killed in an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Nearly a quarter of a million people in 14 countries were killed when coastal communities were inundated by the water. Architecture: Even the strongest buildings may not survive a bad earthquake, but architecture plays a huge role in what and who survives a quake.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-more-likely-an-earthquake-to-hit-a-populated-area>Which is more likely an earthquake to hit a populated area?</h2>
<p>Location: This one is kind of obvious—an earthquake that hits in a populated area is more likely to do damage than one that hits an unpopulated area or the middle of the ocean. Magnitude: Scientists assign a number to represent the amount of seismic energy released by an earthquake.</p>
