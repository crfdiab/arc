<h2 id=what-ideas-were-the-early-state-constitutions-based-on>What ideas were the early state constitutions based on?</h2>
<p>The first state constitutions bespoke a belief in limited government, the consent of the governed, and frequent elections. They were based, by and large, on a Whig tradition emphasizing direct, active, continuing popular control over the legislature in particular and of government in general.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-early-state-constitutions-influence-the-writing-of-the-us-constitution>How did the early state constitutions influence the writing of the US Constitution?</h2>
<p>U.S. HISTORY THESE FIRST STATE CONSTITUTIONS PROVIDED THE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR THE U. S. CONSTITUTION, INCLUDING THE BILL OF RIGHTS. After the Revolutionary War, delegates from the thirteen Ameri- can states met at Philadelphia to draft a new constitution for the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-writers-of-the-constitution-want>What did the writers of the constitution want?</h2>
<p>The writers of the constitution wanted a new plan of government because they felt the old plan gave too much power to the states and allowed too much democracy. They fixed these problems in the document that we now call the Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=what-idea-is-the-constitution-based-on>What idea is the constitution based on?</h2>
<p>popular sovereignty<br>
The Constitution rests on the idea of popular sovereignty—a government in which the people rule. As the nation changed and grew, popu- lar sovereignty took on new meaning. A broader range of Americans shared in the power to govern themselves.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-writers-of-the-constitution-avoid>What did the writers of the Constitution avoid?</h2>
<p>In the Constitution, the Founding Fathers laid the framework of the new government. This was created to ensure no one branch of the government became too powerful thus preventing the possibility of a tyrannical government from appearing again.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-founders-ratify-the-us-constitution>How did the founders ratify the US Constitution?</h2>
<p>It stands today as one of the longest-lived and most emulated constitutions in the world. The founders set the terms for ratifying the Constitution. They bypassed the state legislatures, reasoning that their members would be reluctant to give up power to a national government. Instead, they called for special ratifying conventions in each state.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-first-constitution-of-the-united-states-do>What did the first Constitution of the United States do?</h2>
<p>America’s first constitution, the Articles of Confederation, gave the Confederation Congress the power to make rules and request funds from the states, but it had no enforcement powers, couldn’t regulate commerce, or print money. The states’ disputes over territory, war pensions, taxation,…</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-framers-of-the-constitution-get-their-ideas>How did the framers of the Constitution get their ideas?</h2>
<p>The framers of the Constitution, like most colonists in what would become the United States, were pervaded by Indian images of liberty. — James Mann, in the NYT (7-4-05) The English colonists did not need the Indians to tell them about federalism or self-government.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-articles-of-confederation-lead-to-the-constitution>How did the Articles of Confederation lead to the Constitution?</h2>
<p>The states’ disputes over territory, war pensions, taxation, and trade threatened to tear the young country apart. Alexander Hamilton helped convince Congress to organize a Grand Convention of state delegates to work on revising the Articles of Confederation. Oil on canvas by Junius Brutus Steams.</p>
