<h2 id=did-jackson-support-the-texas-revolution>Did Jackson support the Texas Revolution?</h2>
<p>The U.S. president at the time of the Texas Revolution, Andrew Jackson, had previously approached Mexico about buying Texas. Jackson was an ardent expansionist and a close friend, almost a father, to Sam Houston. Throughout the United States, especially in the South, support for Texas was warm and widespread.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-andrew-jackson-do-in-the-texas-revolution>What did Andrew Jackson do in the Texas Revolution?</h2>
<p>In 1835, Andrew Jackson urged his District Attorneys to prosecute any and all persons who violated US obligations of neutrality between Mexico and Texas.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-president-jackson-resist-texas>Why did President Jackson resist Texas?</h2>
<p>President Andrew Jackson refused to annex Texas during his second term to avoid an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-andrew-jackson-help-the-republic-of-texas>How did Andrew Jackson help the Republic of Texas?</h2>
<p>Bilateral relations. The United States recognized Texan independence on March 3, 1836, when U.S. President Andrew Jackson nominated Alcée La Branche as Minister to Texas. In 1841 The United States’ chargé d’affairs to Texas opened a legation in Austin, in 1841 The Republic of Texas opened an embassy in Washington, DC.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-republic-of-texas-have-trouble-joining-the-us>Why did the Republic of Texas have trouble joining the US?</h2>
<p>One of the issues at play in the interactions between the United States and the Republic of Texas was the eventual annexation of Texas by the U.S. There were two main difficulties with the issue of Texas joining the United States at the time: first, incorporating Texas into the Union might provoke Mexico; and second.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-jqjackson-want-to-annex-texas>Why did j.q.jackson want to annex Texas?</h2>
<p>Key Points: Jackson believed that Texas was part of the Louisiana Purchase and J.Q. Jackson was so mad that he thought it was treason to give up such a land that “rightfully” belonged to the United States, or so he thought. Jackson’s first few attempts at getting Texas failed.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-when-texas-became-an-independent-state>Who was president when Texas became an independent state?</h2>
<p>On his final day in office, Jackson extended official diplomatic recognition to independent Texas. Incoming president Martin Van Buren was opposed to annexation. The Panic of 1837 and the resulting depression tended to mute the issue of admitting Texas to the Union.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-texas-independence-a-problem-for-the-us>Why was the Texas independence a problem for the US?</h2>
<p>To a lesser extent, the relationship with Mexico also was a problem because of conflicting boundary claims. Occasional skirmishes occurred between the citizens of the two nations. A growing body of Texans came to favor annexation by the United States, as preferable to maintaining independence.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-texas-during-the-annexation>Who was the leader of Texas during the annexation?</h2>
<p>Jackson was an ardent expansionist and a close friend, almost a father, to Sam Houston. Other Texas leaders had close ties with important figures in the United States government.</p>
