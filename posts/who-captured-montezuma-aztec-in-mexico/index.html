<p>Hernán Cortés<br>
After a three-month siege, Spanish forces under Hernán Cortés capture Tenochtitlán, the capital of the Aztec empire. Cortés’ men leveled the city and captured Cuauhtémoc, the Aztec emperor.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-moctezuma-treat-cortés>How did Moctezuma treat Cortés?</h2>
<p>How did Moctezuma and Cortés treat each other when they met? What other options might have Moctezuma chosen? Cortés took Moctezuma prisoner and gained control of the city. Cortés would’ve been killed and Moctezuma would take over his land.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-montezuma-receive-the-spanish>How did Montezuma receive the Spanish?</h2>
<p>There were eight bad omens that were recorded later by a Spanish missionary. Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortés and his men landed on the Mexican coast on April of 1519. Montezuma II sent Cortés gifts of gold and chocolate to welcome the Spanish.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-take-to-prevent-montezumas-revenge>What can you take to prevent Montezuma’s revenge?</h2>
<p>Pepto-Bismol (2 ounces four times daily or two tablets four times daily) decreases the diarrhea and shortens the duration of the illness. This medication also appears to be effective in preventing traveler’s diarrhea, but it should not be taken for more than three weeks at a time.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-cortes-find-when-he-met-montezuma>What did Cortes find when he met Montezuma?</h2>
<p>Upon meeting the Aztec ruler Montezuma II and discovering the capital, Tenochtitlán, Cortés and his men were in awe. They had never seen a city as grand or a culture as drastically different from their own.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-cortes-capture-cuauhtemoc-and-defeat-the-aztecs>When did Cortes capture Cuauhtemoc and defeat the Aztecs?</h2>
<p>On 13 August 1521, Cuauhtemoc was captured and the Aztecs admitted defeat. Tenochtitlan, Cortés’s great prize, and its inhabitants were decimated. Cortés had conquered the Aztecs, but at the expense of the beautiful city he hoped to secure. There is one final piece, or rather person, to this puzzle.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hernan-cortes-sail-from-spain-to-mexico>When did Hernan Cortes sail from Spain to Mexico?</h2>
<p>Throughout human history, the vast majority of human interactions occurred between neighbors, relatives, or people that had at least some things in common, such as worshipping the same God. But when Hernán Cortés sailed from Spain to Mexico in 1519, he began an entirely new kind of encounter in human history.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spanish-capture-the-emperor-montezuma>How did the Spanish capture the emperor Montezuma?</h2>
<p>Capture of Montezuma. On November 14, 1519, they got the excuse they needed. A Spanish garrison left on the coast had been attacked by some representatives of the Mexica and several of them were killed. Cortes arranged a meeting with Montezuma, accused him of planning the attack, and took him into custody.</p>
