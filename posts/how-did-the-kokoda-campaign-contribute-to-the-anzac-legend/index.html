<h2 id=how-did-the-kokoda-campaign-contribute-to-the-anzac-legend>How did the Kokoda Campaign contribute to the Anzac legend?</h2>
<p>Kokoda not only was the most important battle won and fought by Australians but it also shaped Australia’s post-war training practises and military. This victory ‘marked the first major turning of the Japanese ground forced during the Pacific war (Taylor et al p. 176-7,181,182).</p>
<h2 id=what-qualities-are-the-anzacs-believed-to-embody>What qualities are the Anzacs believed to embody?</h2>
<p>ANZAC values include such human qualities as courage, mateship, fairness, persistence, integrity, humour, initiative, endurance, determination, ingenuity, respect, and the “selfless spirit of ANZAC”.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-significance-of-the-anzac-legend>What was the significance of the Anzac legend?</h2>
<p>The legend of Anzac was born on 25 April 1915, and was reaffirmed in eight months’ fighting on Gallipoli. Although there was no military victory, the Australians displayed great courage, endurance, initiative, discipline, and mateship. Such qualities came to be seen as the Anzac spirit.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-significance-of-the-kokoda-campaign>What was the significance of the Kokoda campaign?</h2>
<p>The Kokoda Track marks the course of one of the most important battles for Australians in the Second World War. Between 21 July and 16 November 1942, the Australian Army halted the furthermost southward advance by Japanese forces in Papua New Guinea and then pushed the enemy back across the mountains.</p>
<h2 id=what-calibre-was-the-owen-gun>What Calibre was the Owen gun?</h2>
<p>.22″ calibre<br>
Owen’s working model [. 22″ calibre], was brought to the attention of the Australian Army in early 1939 with a view to the Army developing his ideas of a new machine gun.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-anzacs-do-at-kokoda>What did the Anzacs do at Kokoda?</h2>
<p>At Kokoda, a new generation of Anzacs, although showing the same characteristics as their ancestors, achieved much more. As Keating said “The Australians who served here in Papua New Guinea fought and died not in defence of the old world, but the new world.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-kokoda-track-like-for-australian-soldiers>What was Kokoda Track like for Australian soldiers?</h2>
<p>Australian Experiences at the Kokoda Track Kokoda Track, one of the most vital battles in World War II, was the last defense against invasion of Australia by the Japanese. The soldiers who fought on the Kokoda Track had to experience some of the most severe climate and terrain of WWII.</p>
<p>The significance of Kokoda for Australian’s can be seen in many different ways. In a strategic sense and also in a symbolic sense. Firstly, the Kokoda Campaign saved Australia from possible invasion, or more precisely from being isolated from the United States of America .</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-kokoda-trail-in-world-war-2>Where was the Kokoda Trail in World War 2?</h2>
<p>This means the defence of Australia was heavily reliant on the defence of Port Moresby. The Kokoda Trail was a narrow track leading from Buna in the North of Papua to Port Moresby in the South. During World War 2, in 1942, the Japanese and Australians fought against each other along the trail.</p>
