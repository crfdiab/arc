<h2 id=does-the-eurasian-plate-have-volcanoes>Does the Eurasian Plate have volcanoes?</h2>
<p>Eurasia hosts a plethora of different geological features. These include volcanoes, triple junctions, seismically active faults, flood island basalts, accretionary wedges, etc. Iceland’s volcanism is a unique feature located on the Western edge of the Eurasian Plate.</p>
<h2 id=what-plates-are-volcanoes-found-on>What plates are volcanoes found on?</h2>
<p>Most of the world’s volcanoes are found around the edges of tectonic plates, both on land and in the oceans. On land, volcanoes form when one tectonic plate moves under another. Usually a thin, heavy oceanic plate subducts, or moves under, a thicker continental plate.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-eurasian-plate-cover>What does the Eurasian Plate cover?</h2>
<p>The Eurasian Plate is a tectonic plate which includes most of the continent of Eurasia (a landmass consisting of the traditional continents of Europe and Asia), with the notable exceptions of the Indian subcontinent, the Arabian subcontinent, and the area east of the Chersky Range in East Siberia.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-eurasian-plate-constructive-or-destructive>Is the Eurasian Plate constructive or destructive?</h2>
<p>The Nazca and South American plates have destructive plate boundaries, as do the Eurasian and Pacific plates.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-future-of-the-eurasian-plate>What is the future of the Eurasian Plate?</h2>
<p>Based on this current motion I predict that over the course of the next 10-100 million years, the collision between the Arabian and Eurasian plate will close off and potentially eliminate the Persian Gulf. All the while the simultaneously Red Sea will become wider.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-eurasian-plate-located-in-the-world>Where is the Eurasian Plate located in the world?</h2>
<p>Eurasian Plate. The Eurasian Plate is a tectonic plate which includes most of the continent of Eurasia (a landmass consisting of the traditional continents of Europe and Asia), with the notable exceptions of the Indian subcontinent, the Arabian subcontinent, and the area east of the Chersky Range in East Siberia.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-volcanoes-located-on-the-earths-surface>Where are volcanoes located on the earth’s surface?</h2>
<p>Where are volcanoes located? Where are volcanoes located? Volcanoes are found along destructive (subducting) plate boundaries, constructive (divergent) plate boundaries and at hot spots in the earth’s surface. They are found down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean where the North American Plate and Eurasian plate form a constructive plate margin.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-plates-that-cause-volcanoes>What are the three plates that cause volcanoes?</h2>
<p>The Eurasian Plate, Pacific Plate and Indo-Australian Plate are three active tectonic plates that cause the subduction zones that form these volcanoes.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-the-eurasian-plate-diverge-from-the-american-plate>How often does the Eurasian Plate diverge from the American Plate?</h2>
<p>The south side of the Eurasian plate neighbors the Arabian, Indian and Sunda plates. It straddles along Iceland where it tears the country in two separate pieces at a rate of 2.5 to 3 cm per year. The Eurasian Plate also diverges away from the North American plate at a rate of about 3 centimeters per year.</p>
