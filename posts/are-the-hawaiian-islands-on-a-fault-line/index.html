<h2 id=are-the-hawaiian-islands-on-a-fault-line>Are the Hawaiian islands on a fault line?</h2>
<p>Hawaii is far removed from geological fault lines (which makes the Hawaiian volcanoes also something special), but the hot spot below the Hawaiian islands and the volcanic activity caused by it causes enough stress in the earth’s crust to make Hawaii a very active seismic region.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-tsunamis-in-hawaii>Are there tsunamis in Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Tsunamis are a series of very dangerous, large, long ocean waves. Since 1946, more than 220 people have died in the State of Hawaii, including six on Oahu, due to tsunamis.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-big-tsunami-in-hawaii>When was the last big tsunami in Hawaii?</h2>
<p>By JOHN BURNETT Hawaii Tribune-Herald | Friday, March 12, 2021, 12:05 a.m. Alii Drive in Kailua-Kona sustained major damage and was strewn with debris in the aftermath of the March 11, 2011, tsunami.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-trenches-in-hawaii>Are there trenches in Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Hawaii has been making headlines lately with multiple eruptions so far this month from the Kilauea volcano. Hawaii sits smack dab in the middle of the Ring of Fire, a 25,000 mile boundary around the Pacific Ocean where tectonic plates meet to create volcanoes, earthquakes, and deep ocean trenches.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-earthquakes-have-there-been-in-the-hawaiian-islands>How many earthquakes have there been in the Hawaiian Islands?</h2>
<p>During the past 30 days, Hawaiian Islands was shaken by 2 quakes of magnitude 4.0 or above, 17 quakes between 3.0 and 4.0, and 402 quakes between 2.0 and 3.0. There were also 378 quakes below magnitude 2.0 which people don’t normally feel.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-hawaii-the-most-earthquake-prone-state>Why is Hawaii the most earthquake prone state?</h2>
<p>Notice that Hawaii (on the far left) is totally blacked out by dots. Hawaii is not the state with most earthquakes, but it is the state with the highest earthquake density! This means that at any given time and place, on average on Hawaii you are most likely to experience an earthquake</p>
<h2 id=is-the-hawaiian-islands-part-of-the-pacific-plate>Is the Hawaiian Islands part of the Pacific Plate?</h2>
<p>The Pacific Plate is just one of the Earth’s roughly 20 tectonic plates, which are constantly in motion and are responsible for events like earthquakes. There are many landforms around the Hawaiian Islands that formed from the same volcanic hot spot.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-islands-of-hawaii-being-shaped>How are the islands of Hawai’i being shaped?</h2>
<p>The islands of Hawai’i are still being shaped by shifts of its tectonic plate, the Pacific Plate. This causes magma to gusher out of volcanoes as lava like this eruption on the Big Island of Hawai’i. Photograph by Bruce Beck</p>
