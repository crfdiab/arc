<h2 id=how-did-the-goddess-hathor-die>How did the goddess Hathor die?</h2>
<p>Hathor was, in early times, worshipped in the form of a cow or as a cow with stars above her. She vanishes into the distant desert and hides in the arid plains. The Eye of Ra, like the Distant Goddess, was associated with a number of female deities but, again, often Hathor.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-heqet>Who was Heqet?</h2>
<p>Heqet (Egyptian ḥqt, also ḥqtyt “Heqtit”), sometimes spelled Heket, is an Egyptian goddess of fertility, identified with Hathor, represented in the form of a frog. To the Egyptians, the frog was an ancient symbol of fertility, related to the annual flooding of the Nile.</p>

<p>Hathor<br>
Hathor was one of the forty-two state gods and goddesses of Egypt, and one of the most popular and powerful. She was goddess of many things: love, beauty, music, dancing, fertility, and pleasure.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-isis-the-goddess>Who is Isis the goddess?</h2>
<p>Isis was the daughter of the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut and the sister of the deities Osiris, Seth, and Nephthys. She was also wife to Osiris, god of the underworld, and bore him a son, Horus. Learn more about Isis’s brother and husband, Osiris.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-khepri>Who is khepri?</h2>
<p>Khepri, the scarab-headed god second from the right, is the morning manifestation of Ra, associated in particular with creation: the eggs of the scarab beetle are laid in dung and so emerge fully formed, their incubation hidden from the world.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-egyptian-goddess-of-death>Who is the Egyptian goddess of death?</h2>
<p>Osiris. Osiris, one of Egypt’s most important deities, was god of the underworld. He also symbolized death, resurrection, and the cycle of Nile floods that Egypt relied on for agricultural fertility.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-goddess-of-motherhood>Who is the goddess of motherhood?</h2>
<p>Leto<br>
She is the mother of Apollo and Artemis. The island of Kos is claimed to be her birthplace. However, Diodorus, in 2.47 states clearly that Leto was born in Hyperborea and not in Kos….</p>

<h2 id=is-taweret-pregnant>Is Taweret pregnant?</h2>
<p>Most scholars suggest that Taweret is pregnant which adds to her symbolism in being the defender of pregnancy; however I find that the figures of Taweret are not pregnant yet are depicted with a swollen abdomen to represent the female form which is able to be pregnant, that is, to be fertile.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-heqet-important-to-the-ancient-egyptians>Why was Heqet important to the ancient Egyptians?</h2>
<p>To the Egyptians, the frog was an ancient symbol of fertility, related to the annual flooding of the Nile. Heqet was originally the female counterpart of Khnum, or the wife of Khnum by whom she became the mother of Her-ur.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-goddess-of-birth-in-egypt>Who is the goddess of birth in Egypt?</h2>
<p>Heket (Egypt) Heket the moon Goddess was associated with Hathor as a birth deity. She was said to be the birth goddess of all creatures. She is imaged as a frog, a frog-headed woman or a frog at the end of a phallus. She is the wife of Khnum and is associated with the flooding of the nile. It is Heqet who breathes life into a newborn baby.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-ancient-egyptians-name-their-frog-heqet>Why did the ancient Egyptians name their frog Heqet?</h2>
<p>To the Egyptians, the frog was an ancient symbol of fertility, related to the annual flooding of the Nile. Heqet was originally the female counterpart of Khnum, or the wife of Khnum by whom she became the mother of Her-ur. It has been proposed that her name is the origin of the name of Hecate, the Greek goddess of witchcraft.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-midwife-in-the-ancient-egypt>Who was the midwife in the ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Some say that—even though no ancient Egyptian term for “midwife” is known for certain—midwives often called themselves the Servants of Heqet, and that her priestesses were trained in midwifery. Women often wore amulets of her during childbirth, which depicted Heqet as a frog, sitting in a lotus .</p>
