<h2 id=why-was-spain-not-really-interested-in-texas>Why was Spain not really interested in Texas?</h2>
<p>Fear of Indian attacks and the remoteness of the area from the rest of the Viceroyalty discouraged European settlers from moving to Texas. It remained one of the provinces least-populated by immigrants. The threat of attacks did not decrease until 1785, when Spain and the Comanche peoples made a peace agreement.</p>
