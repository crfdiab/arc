<h2 id=when-did-portugal-take-angola>When did Portugal take Angola?</h2>
<p>Between 1890 and 1904 the Portuguese conquered all of the Ovimbundu kingdoms and incorporated them into the Colony of Angola. The colonial conquest of Angola by the Portuguese was a process which unfolded in various stages over almost 400 years.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-portugal-take-over-angola>Why did Portugal take over Angola?</h2>
<p>Disputes over control of trade, particularly regarding slaves from Kongo and its neighbours, led the Portuguese to look for new allies, especially the Ndongo kingdom. After undertaking several missions there, the Portuguese established a colony at Luanda in 1575.</p>
<h2 id=is-angola-one-of-the-richest-country-in-africa>Is Angola one of the richest country in Africa?</h2>
