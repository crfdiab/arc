<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-canada-in-2021>What was the population of Canada in 2021?</h2>
<p>The current population of Canada is 38,110,998 as of Saturday, August 14, 2021, based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-canada-in-1500>What was the population of Canada in 1500?</h2>
<p>For example, the rapacious 19th-century slaughter of the great bison herds was partly a stratagem to deprive the Plains First Nations of their crucial resource base. In 1500, there were about 300,000 indigenous people in Canada, a population that subsequently collapsed to perhaps 60,000.</p>
<h2 id=how-has-the-canadian-population-changed>How has the Canadian population changed?</h2>
<p>Most of Canada’s population growth is already driven by immigration. In 2019, about 82 per cent of the population growth came from the arrival of immigrants, and about 18 per cent came from new births, a number which is decreasing every year according to Statistics Canada.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-population-of-canada-in-the-world>What’s the population of Canada in the world?</h2>
<p>Canada ranks 38th by population, comprising about 0.5% of the world’s total, with over 37 million Canadians as of 2019. Despite being the second largest country by area, the vast majority of the country is sparsely inhabited, with most of its population south of the 55th parallel north and more than half…</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-canada-before-confederation>What was the population of Canada before Confederation?</h2>
<p>The population has increased every year since the establishment of the Dominion of Canada in 1867; however, the population of Newfoundland was not included prior to its entry into confederation as Canada’s tenth province in 1949. The first national census of the country was taken in 1871, with a population count around 3,689,000.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-population-of-canada-start-growing>When did the population of Canada start growing?</h2>
<p>During the late 18th and early 19th century Canada under British rule experienced strong population growth.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-canada-have-a-high-population-density>Why does Canada have a high population density?</h2>
<p>The large size of Canada’s north which is not arable, and thus cannot support large human populations, significantly lowers the country’s carrying capacity. Therefore, the population density of the habitable land in Canada can be modest to high depending on the region.</p>
