<h2 id=when-did-the-british-occupy-china>When did the British occupy China?</h2>
<p>1839<br>
In 1839, Britain invaded China to crush opposition to its interference in the country’s economic and political affairs. One of Britain’s first acts of the war was to occupy Hong Kong, a sparsely inhabited island off the coast of southeast China.</p>
<h2 id=did-british-ever-rule-china>Did British ever rule China?</h2>
<p>Although British imperialism never politically took hold in mainland China, as it did in India or Africa, its cultural and political legacy is still evident today. Honk Kong remains a significant center of global finance and its government still functioned in much of the same ways as it did under British colonialism.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-uk-give-hong-kong-back-to-china>When did the UK give Hong Kong back to China?</h2>
<p>A general view of the handover ceremony showing the Chinese flag flying after the Union flag was lowered July 1, 1997. The UK handed Hong Kong back to China on July 1 1997 after ruling it for more than 150 years.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-relations-between-the-uk-and-china-so-bad>Why are relations between the UK and China so bad?</h2>
<p>The countries have fallen out over issues including Hong Kong, tech giant Huawei and alleged human rights abuses against China’s Uighur ethnic group. Hong Kong is a former British colony, which was handed back to China in 1997. But before Hong Kong was returned, the UK and China made an agreement to introduce “one country, two systems”.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-british-prime-minister-when-hong-kong-was-leased-to-china>Who was British Prime Minister when Hong Kong was leased to China?</h2>
<p>The British Lease of Hong Kong: Key Takeaways. In 1984, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang negotiated the underlying plan for the lease to end, such that Hong Kong would remain a semi-autonomous region for a 50-year period after the lease ended.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-handover-of-hong-kong-to-china>When was the handover of Hong Kong to China?</h2>
<p>The transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, commonly known as the handover of Hong Kong (or simply the Handover, also the Return in mainland China), occurred at midnight at the start of 1 July 1997, when the United Kingdom ended administration for the colony of Hong Kong and returned control of the territory to China.</p>
