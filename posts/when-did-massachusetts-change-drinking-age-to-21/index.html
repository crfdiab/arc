<p>December 4, 1984<br>
On December 4, 1984, governor Michael S. Dukakis signed a bill raising the drinking age from 20 to 21 in Massachusetts. This bill was in response to the National Minimum Drinking Age Act which would reduce federal highway funding by 10% for any state that did not adopt a drinking age of 21.</p>

<p>1984<br>
When the voting age was dropped to 18 in 1971, Massachusetts dropped the drinking age to 18 within a few years. However, they raised it to 20 due to concerns about teens drinking and driving in 1979. In 1984, the passing of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act prompted the state to increase the drinking age to 21.</p>

<p>In 2007, Texas state representative Rob Eissler proposed a bill, now known as the “Cinderella Bill,” which prohibited 21-year-olds from drinking until 7 a.m. on their birthday.

<p>Now when you could drink depended on your residency. Most states chose to establish the legal minimum drinking age to 21 (perhaps to commemorate the 21st Amendment), but some instated lower minimum ages ranging from 18 to 20. In 1971, when the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18, 30 states saw it fit to lower the drinking age concurrently.</p>
