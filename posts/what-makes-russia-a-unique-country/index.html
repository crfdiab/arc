<h2 id=what-makes-russia-a-unique-country>What makes Russia a unique country?</h2>
<p>As the world’s largest country, Russia occupies one-tenth of all the land on Earth. It spans 11 time zones across two continents (Europe and Asia) and has shores on three oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Ocean). Russia has around 100,000 rivers, including some of the longest and most powerful in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-system-does-russia-use>What type of system does Russia use?</h2>
<p>The 1993 constitution declares Russia a democratic, federative, law-based state with a republican form of government. State power is divided among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Diversity of ideologies and religions is sanctioned, and a state or compulsory ideology may not be adopted.</p>
<h2 id=what-social-system-is-russia>What social system is Russia?</h2>
<p>According to my hypothesis, Russian society consists of four social groups: an upper level, a middle level, a base level, and a lower level, as well as a desocialized “social bottom.” The upper stratum refers, above all, to the effective ruling stratum, which performs the role of the principal agent of reforms.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-prominent-city-state-in-early-russia>What was the most prominent city state in early Russia?</h2>
<p>First documented in 1147, Moscow grew to become a prosperous and powerful city that served as the capital of the Grand Duchy that bears its namesake. When the Grand Duchy of Moscow evolved into the Tsardom of Russia, Moscow still remained as the political and economic center for most of the Tsardom’s history.</p>
<h2 id=is-russia-a-hierarchy>Is Russia a hierarchy?</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, Russian society remained strongly hierarchical. Tsarist political structures, religious values, the military and bureaucracy, rules governing land ownership and the legal code all reinforced Russia’s social hierarchy, defining position and status.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-law-does-russia-have-now>What kind of law does Russia have now?</h2>
<p>The Constitutional Court has the greatest expertise in applying international law. During the Soviet period, Russian law was considered to be socialist law. Since the fall of the Soviet Union that is no longer the case, and most scholars have classified the Russian legal system as a civil law system.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-technology-do-they-have-in-russia>What kind of Technology do they have in Russia?</h2>
<p>Russia already tech champions of its own, such as Yandex and Mail.Ru, but other local firms might also benefit. The country plans to create its own Wikipedia and politicians have passed a bill that bans the sale of smartphones that do not have Russian software pre-installed.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-republics-are-there-in-the-russian-federation>How many republics are there in the Russian Federation?</h2>
<p>Republics of Russia. According to the Constitution, the Russian Federation is divided into 85 federal subjects (constituent units), 22 of which are “republics”.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-republic-of-russia-the-same-as-a-republic>Is the Republic of Russia the same as a republic?</h2>
<p>The expression “autonomous republic” is still sometimes used for the republics of Russia. Although they are autonomous and republics, the use of this term is not technically correct, since their official names, as per 1993 Russian Constitution and their own constitutions, are simply “republic”, rather than “autonomous republic”.</p>
