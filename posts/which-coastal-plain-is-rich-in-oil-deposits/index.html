<p>Gulf Coast Coastal Plain<br>
The Gulf Coast Coastal Plain possesses oil and natural gas deposits.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-petroleum-an-important-natural-resource>Why is petroleum an important natural resource?</h2>
<p>Petroleum is used to make gasoline for cars and other products, like tires or life jackets. Petroleum began its life millions of years ago. Organic matter like plants, algae and plankton drifted in the oceans. These organisms eventually died and sank to the seafloor.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-petroleum-used-for>What is petroleum used for?</h2>
<p>What are petroleum products, and what is petroleum used for? Petroleum products include transportation fuels, fuel oils for heating and electricity generation, asphalt and road oil, and feedstocks for making the chemicals, plastics, and synthetic materials that are in nearly everything we use.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-important-industry-in-the-coastal-plains>What is an important industry in the coastal plains?</h2>
<p>Industries found in the Coastal Plains include processing, manufacturing and marketing products, mainly seafood and wood. Others are tourism & recreation, shipping, papermaking, commercial fishing and forestry.</p>
<h2 id=what-resources-are-found-in-the-coastal-plains>What resources are found in the coastal plains?</h2>
<p>Mineral resources in the Coastal Plain have accumulated primarily as a result of sedimentary processes (Figure 5.15). Sand and gravel, limestone for cement, crushed stone, and clay are mined throughout the region.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-petroleum-so-important>Why is petroleum so important?</h2>
<p>Oil: lifeblood of the industrialised nations Oil has become the world’s most important source of energy since the mid-1950s. Its products underpin modern society, mainly supplying energy to power industry, heat homes and provide fuel for vehicles and aeroplanes to carry goods and people all over the world.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-petroleum-used-in-everyday-life>How is petroleum used in everyday life?</h2>
<p>Petroleum is used extensively in Modern day life. Petroleum provides fuel to run vehicles, cook food, heat homes and generate electricity. Gasoline is a common fuel used for transportation needs. Oil based paints and paint additives are produces from petrochemicals.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-the-coastal-plains>What is the importance of the coastal plains?</h2>
<p>Both eastern and western coastal plains are favourable regions for agricultural purposes. They enjoy equable temperature condition throughout the year and as such they are suitable regions for human habitation.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-oil-and-gas-come-from-in-the-coastal-plain>Where does oil and gas come from in the coastal plain?</h2>
<p>Today, oil and gas production associated with Coastal Plain sediments has moved mostly offshore, into the Gulf of Mexico. Much of this oil and gas formed and was trapped in similar ways to that onshore, with salt structures leading to offshore traps (see Figure 7.12).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-petroleum-an-important-source-of-energy>Why is petroleum an important source of energy?</h2>
<p>Petroleum, also called crude oil, is an important source of energy, according to Natural Resources Canada. Oil provided approximately 34 percent of the world’s energy needs in 2008….</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-industries-in-the-coastal-plains-region-of-texas>What are the major industries in the coastal plains region of Texas?</h2>
<p>Business and Industries. In the Coastal Plains region of Texas there are many job opportunities. Some of the major industriies are the Timber Industry, Petrochemical Industry and the Petroleum Industry. There is also much work in fishing and shrimping as obviously, the Coastal Plains lye on the coast.</p>
