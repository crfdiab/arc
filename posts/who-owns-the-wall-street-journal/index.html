<h2 id=who-owns-the-wall-street-journal>Who owns the Wall Street Journal?</h2>
<p>Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.<br>
The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) is a newspaper and news agency based in New York, N.Y. It was founded in by Charles Dow, Edward Jones and Charles Bergstresser in 1889. The WSJ is a division of Dow Jones, which is currently owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-wall-street-journal-a-scholarly-source>Is The Wall Street Journal a scholarly source?</h2>
<p>You are not able to tell if a publication is a scholarly journal by simply looking at the name. There are many examples when a periodical has the word journal in the title, but in fact is not a scholarly journal. The Wall Street Journal and Ladies Home Journal are examples of this.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-wall-street-journal-peer-reviewed>Is The Wall Street Journal peer reviewed?</h2>
<p>A non-peer reviewed source can include any of the following: newspapers (such as Wall Street Journal), trade journals (such as Engineering News Record), popular magazines (such as Cosmopolitan), and News/General Interest magazines/journals (such as Forbes).</p>
<h2 id=is-the-wsj-worth-it>Is the WSJ worth it?</h2>
<p>Is the Wall Street Journal subscription worth it? Wall Street Journal subscription is definitely worth it. Even if you aren’t in the business background and just there for learning about finance, business, and what goes on in the business sector in your country, Wall Street Journal could be a good source for it.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-wall-street-journal-target-audience>Who is The Wall Street Journal target audience?</h2>
<p>WSJ.com reaches an audience of 42 million digital readers per month who seek the news and information critical to their business and personal lives.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-wall-street-journal-connected-to-fox-news>Is The Wall Street Journal connected to Fox News?</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, the Wall Street Journal’s low level of bias stands in marked contrast with Murdoch-owned Fox News and Fox Business Network, both of which are run by former political consultant Roger Ailes and are widely considered to be the voice of the right-wing of the Republican party in the U.S.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-newspaper-be-a-scholarly-source>Can a newspaper be a scholarly source?</h2>
<p>Although you may find lots of good information, facts, data and coverage of current events in newspapers, it’s important to remember that newspapers are not scholarly sources. Newspapers are not peer-reviewed and are typically written by journalists.</p>
<h2 id=is-cnn-a-scholarly-source>Is CNN a scholarly source?</h2>
<p>Or, if popular magazines are E! News, and serious magazines are CNN, then scholarly journals are PBS; not a lot of flash but a lot of information. Articles in journals are where original research shows up. They are written by experts, usually university faculty or research scientists.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-know-if-a-source-is-peer-reviewed>How do you know if a source is peer-reviewed?</h2>
<p>If the article is from a printed journal, look at the publication information in the front of the journal. If the article is from an electronic journal, go to the journal home page and look for a link to ‘About this journal’ or ‘Notes for Authors’. Here it should tell you if the articles are peer-reviewed.</p>
<h2 id=is-google-scholar-peer-reviewed>Is Google Scholar peer-reviewed?</h2>
<p>Released in beta in November 2004, the Google Scholar index includes most peer-reviewed online academic journals and books, conference papers, theses and dissertations, preprints, abstracts, technical reports, and other scholarly literature, including court opinions and patents.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-read-wsj-for-free>How can I read WSJ for free?</h2>
<p>The Easiest Way To Read The Wall Street Journal For Free All it takes is a simple Google Chrome extension called “Read WSJ,” which places a little “unlock” button next to any locked articles. Click the unlock button, and you’re off reading the article.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-barrons-or-wall-street-journal>Which is better Barrons or Wall Street Journal?</h2>
<p>In my opinion, Barron’s is better than the Wall Street Journal, but they cover entirely different subjects. Barron’s focuses extensively on financial markets and investing. In contrast, the WSJ will cover world news, financial markets, technology, science, and other newsworthy topics.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-wall-street-journal-a-conservative-publication>Is the Wall Street Journal a conservative publication?</h2>
<p>Murdoch owns a controlling 39.4% voting stake in both News Corp and 21st Century Fox. It is a conservative, business-oriented publication, but it is less overtly political than Murdoch’s other major media outlet, Fox News.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-bias-does-the-wall-street-journal-have>What kind of bias does the Wall Street Journal have?</h2>
<p>The Wall Street Journal has been classified by media bias centers as right-center, meaning its bias is moderately conservative. The Wall Street Journal has been known for being anti-tax and anti-government regulation as well as being against health care reform. Fair and Objective With a Slight Bias</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-reporting-does-the-wall-street-journal-do>What kind of reporting does the Wall Street Journal do?</h2>
<p>The Wall Street Journal has been known for being anti-tax and anti-government regulation as well as being against health care reform. The Wall Street Journal’s news reporting is generally considered to be fair and objective, and mostly factual.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-owner-of-the-wall-street-journal>Who is the owner of the Wall Street Journal?</h2>
<p>Updated Mar 1, 2020 The Wall Street Journal is controlled by Rupert Murdoch via Dow Jones Publications, which in turn is owned by Murdoch’s News Corp. It published its first issue on July 8, 1889, under original publishers Charles Dow, Charles Bergstresser, and Edward Jones.</p>
