<p>Before a tropical cyclone develops, tall clouds are observed in the sky. The air is dry and cold, and its relative humidity is high. The sky is clear. Present a picture of a place during a typhoon.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-we-do-before-during-and-after-the-storm-or-typhoon>What should we do before during and after the storm or typhoon?</h2>

<p>Before the typhoon Make sure your phones, portable chargers and other devices are fully charged. Bring in outdoor plants and other objects that could be blown away by heavy winds. Ensure that larger objects — bicycles, laundry poles, etc. — are secure.</p>
<h2 id=what-damage-does-a-typhoon-cause>What damage does a typhoon cause?</h2>
<p>Typhoons affect peoples lives because there are land slides and flooding. They are very destructive so they take peoples lives, they ruin peoples property and buildings and they blow down power lines.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-positive-effect-of-typhoon>What is the positive effect of typhoon?</h2>
<p>The typhoons increase nutrients concentrations owing to river runoff, and upwelling, which attracts much more fishes to accumulate for food (Houde et al., 2005). The positive effect is important for fishing (Qiu et al., 2010).</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-a-typhoon-last>How long does a typhoon last?</h2>
<p>They last for about six days, in general, before they enter the land or reach sub-tropical latitudes. However, some can be detected only a few hours or perhaps a day or two, while others are observed as long as a fortnight.</p>
<h2 id=is-signal-no-1-strong>Is Signal No 1 Strong?</h2>
<p>Very heavy damage to medium-risk structures. Heavy damage to low-risk structures; Almost total damage to structures of light in highly exposed coastal areas.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-weather-before-and-after-a-typhoon>What happens to the weather before and after a typhoon?</h2>
<p>1. OBSERVE THE CHANGES IN THE WEATHER BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER A TYPHOON; SCIENCE 5 2. BEFORE • HIGH CLOUDS IN THE SKY • AIR IS DRY AND COLD (WARM AIR RISES ALREADY) • RELATIVE HUMIDITY IS HIGH • WIND GENTLY BLOWS • SCATTERED RAIN SHOWER 3.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-condition-of-environment-during-a-tropical-cyclone>What is the condition of environment during a tropical cyclone?</h2>
<p>Some trees and crops may be uprooted because of strong winds PSWS (Public Storm Warning Signals) the gauge for strength of tropical cyclone entering PAR use by PAGASA . It based on the strength and speed of wind accompanied by typhoon. AFTER 1. Sun becomes visible 2. sky clearer 3. there might be scattered rain showers 4. some area may be flooded</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-if-your-house-is-damaged-by-typhoon>What to do if your house is damaged by Typhoon?</h2>
<p>Monitor and update yourself with the progress of the typhoon through radio, television or the internet (should this be accessible). If your house was one of the heavily damaged, make sure that you heed to the advice of the authorities regarding its safety and stability. If they are uncertain of your house’s condition, do not go yet.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-normal-to-have-a-typhoon-in-the-philippines>Is it normal to have a typhoon in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Heavy rains had made the Philippines’ capital paralyzed this week submerging about 70% of its total land area. This scenario has always become a “normal” scene and an annual headline every rainy season. Storms have become the country’s constant visitor and they always, I mean always leave something disastrous after.</p>
