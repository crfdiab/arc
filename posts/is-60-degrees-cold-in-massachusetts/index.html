<h2 id=is-60-degrees-cold-in-massachusetts>Is 60 degrees cold in Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>Massachusetts receives about 43 inches or 1,090 millimetres of rain annually, fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, slightly wetter during the winter. Summers are warm with average high temperatures in July above 80 °F or 26.7 °C and overnight lows above 60 °F or 15.6 °C common throughout the state.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-hottest-its-been-in-massachusetts>What is the hottest it’s been in Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>107° F<br>
The highest temperature of record is 107° F on August 2, 1975, at New Bedford (southern Bristol County) and Chester (northern Worchester County). The lowest of record was -35° F on January 12, 1981, again at Chester.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-months-is-cold-in-massachusetts>How many months is cold in Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>The cold season lasts for 3.4 months, from December 4 to March 15, with an average daily high temperature below 45°F.</p>
<h2 id=has-it-ever-snowed-in-july-massachusetts>Has it ever snowed in July Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>It is believed that on June 7 snow flurries occurred in greater Boston, which is likely the latest seasonal instance of snowfall in Boston history. In July and August, the unprecedented cold weather pattern continued, with temperatures dropping to 40 degrees Fahrenheit on certain days as far south as Connecticut.</p>
<h2 id=could-the-year-without-a-summer-happen-again>Could The Year Without a Summer happen again?</h2>
<p>If the climate continues to change at its current rate, our children – and even some of us – could experience “years without summers” in the not too distant future. It is believed – and this study appears to have confirmed – that this devastating eruption triggered the so-called “year without a summer” in 1816.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-temperature-in-boston-ma-each-month>What’s the average temperature in Boston MA each month?</h2>

<h2 id=what-are-the-requirements-to-graduate-from-high-school-in-massachusetts>What are the requirements to graduate from high school in Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>Local graduation requirements may vary extensively, since MassCore is only a recommendation. Students must also pass grade 10 Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) exams in English, math, and science, and meet the MCAS competency determination requirement in order to graduate.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-tuition-for-the-university-of-massachusetts>What’s the tuition for the University of Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>Tuition & Fees The University of Massachusetts is dedicated to making a world-class education accessible and affordable. Tuition rates for the University of Massachusetts are set by the university’s Board of Trustees in July for the coming fall.</p>
