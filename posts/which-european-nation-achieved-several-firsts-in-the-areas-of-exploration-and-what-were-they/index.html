<p>Equipped with new maritime instruments and knowledge, the Portuguese accomplished many “firsts” in global exploration. In 1487 Bartholomew Diaz sailed his caravel around the southern tip of Africa, the first European to do so (his crew refused to press on to India).</p>
<h2 id=which-event-in-european-exploration-happened-first>Which event in European exploration happened first?</h2>
<p>The first phase is the exploration of the Old World centred on the Mediterranean Sea, the second is the so-called Age of Discovery, during which, in the search for sea routes to Cathay (the name by which China was known to medieval Europe), a New World was found, and the third is the establishment of the political.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-first-european-voyagers>Who were the first European voyagers?</h2>
<p>The first known European explorers to arrive on the continent, Vikings from Scandinavia led by Leif Eriksson (c. 970–1020), appeared around 1000 C.E. and established a temporary settlement in the present-day Canadian province of Newfoundland.</p>
<h2 id=what-major-events-happened-in-the-age-of-exploration>What major events happened in the Age of Exploration?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jan 1, 1400. Prince Henry sponsors Portugese Explorers.</li>
<li>Oct 12, 1492. Christopher Columbus discovers the Caribbean Islands.</li>
<li>Jan 1, 1493. Columbian Exchange.</li>
<li>Jul 8, 1497. Vasco da Gama reaches India.</li>
<li>Jan 1, 1500. Spanish Settlers and Missionaries.</li>
<li>Aug 13, 1521. Hernan Cortes Conqueres the Aztecs.</li>
<li>Jan 1, 1550.</li>
<li>Jan 1, 1600.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-european-in-the-united-states>Who was the first European in the United States?</h2>
<p>The Spanish were among the first Europeans to explore the New World and the first to settle in what is now the United States. By 1650, however, England had established a dominant presence on the Atlantic coast. The first colony was founded at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-social-background-of-england-in-449-ad>What was the social background of England in 449 AD?</h2>
<p>449 AD: The Coming of the English and the beginning of English social background The English have one point above all that divides them from the Brythonic peoples that preceded them on the Island that is England. They had the 19 quantities of Anglo-Saxon chronicles.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-some-important-people-in-the-history-of-europe>Who are some important people in the history of Europe?</h2>
<p>Others involved in that first step included the statesmen Alcide De Gasperi and Paul-Henri Spaak. All except Monnet were men from Europe’s linguistic and political frontiers—Schuman from Lorraine, Adenauer from the Rhineland, De Gasperi from northern Italy, Spaak from bilingual Belgium. Europe’s diversity thus helped foster its impulse to unite.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-europe-in-the-20th-century>What was the history of Europe in the 20th century?</h2>
<p>In the 20th century, World War I and World War II resulted in massive numbers of deaths. The Cold War dominated European geo-politics from 1947 to 1989. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, the European countries grew together.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-culture-of-england-in-the-1000s>What was the culture of England in the 1000’s?</h2>
<p>Someone travelling around England in 1000 would have heard many languages including Anglo-Saxon, Norse, Welsh, Norman French and Cornish. England was part of Christendom, which meant strong cultural links with the rest of Europe.</p>
