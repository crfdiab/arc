<h2 id=what-happened-to-agriculture-in-the-1930s>What happened to agriculture in the 1930s?</h2>
<p>Farmers Grow Angry and Desperate. In the early 1930s prices dropped so low that many farmers went bankrupt and lost their farms. In some cases, the price of a bushel of corn fell to just eight or ten cents. Some farm families began burning corn rather than coal in their stoves because corn was cheaper.</p>
<h2 id=what-led-to-the-depression-of-1930s>What led to the Depression of 1930’s?</h2>
<p>It began after the stock market crash of October 1929, which sent Wall Street into a panic and wiped out millions of investors. Over the next several years, consumer spending and investment dropped, causing steep declines in industrial output and employment as failing companies laid off workers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-foreign-countries-react-to-the-hawley-smoot-tariff>How did foreign countries react to the Hawley Smoot Tariff?</h2>
<p>The Smoot-Hawley Act increased tariffs on foreign imports to the U.S. by about 20%. At least 25 countries responded by increasing their own tariffs on American goods. Global trade plummeted, contributing to the ill effects of the Great Depression.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-unemployment-rate-go-up-during-the-great-depression>Why did the unemployment rate go up during the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>The first question is why was there such high unemployment in 1933. The answer is that the economy was not producing (because it could not sell) as much output as it was capable of producing. This is because the umemployment rate represents what is not produced that could be produced.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-highest-tariff-in-us-history>What was the highest Tariff in US history?</h2>
<p>Hawley, it was signed by President Herbert Hoover on June 17, 1930. The act raised US tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods. The tariffs under the act, excluding duty-free imports (see Tariff levels below), were the second highest in United States history, exceeded by only the Tariff of 1828.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-farmers-in-the-1930s>What was life like for farmers in the 1930’s?</h2>
<p>‘Hard Times’ ‘The Dirty 30s’ ‘The Great Depression’ These are some of the phrases we use to describe the period from 1930 through 1939. Farming in the 1930s on the Great Plains was perhaps the most difficult occupation in the […] Volunteer Visit the Farm SEARCH The Farm Creating a farm What is a Living History Farm? 2018 Review Volunteer</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-us-foreign-policy-in-the-1930s>What was the US foreign policy in the 1930s?</h2>
<p>American History: Roosevelt’s Foreign Policy in the 1930s. In nineteen thirty – three, a major international economic conference was held in London. France and Italy led a movement to link the value of every nation’s money to the price of gold. American delegates to the conference rejected the idea.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-a-drought-in-the-1930s>Why was there a drought in the 1930s?</h2>
<p>Farmers not only faced a global economic slow down of historic proportions, but they also faced one of the worst and longest droughts in America’s history. People around the world had no money to buy the crops and animals that farmers produced, and the drought made it almost impossible to plant and harvest the crops in the first place.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-farmers-make-money-in-the-populist-era>How did farmers make money in the populist era?</h2>
<p>When market prices rose sufficiently high enough, the farmer could withdraw his crops, sell at the higher price, repay the government loan, and still have profit remaining.</p>
