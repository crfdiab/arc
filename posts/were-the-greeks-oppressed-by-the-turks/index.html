<h2 id=were-the-greeks-oppressed-by-the-turks>Were the Greeks oppressed by the Turks?</h2>
<p>Some Hellenes Endured 850 Years. ATHENS – Every Greek School refugee or graduate carries with him at least this one piece of Greek historical knowledge for the rest of his life – that the Greeks were oppressed for 400 years by the Turks.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-greeks-in-the-ottoman-empire>What happened to the Greeks in the Ottoman Empire?</h2>
<p>Before World War I, there were an estimated 1.8 million Greeks living in the Ottoman Empire. From 1914 until 1923, Greeks in Thrace and Asia Minor were subject to a campaign including massacres and internal deportations involving death marches.</p>

<h2 id=who-conquered-greece>Who conquered Greece?</h2>
<p>the Romans<br>
Like all civilizations, however, Ancient Greece eventually fell into decline and was conquered by the Romans, a new and rising world power. Years of internal wars weakened the once powerful Greek city-states of Sparta, Athens, Thebes, and Corinth.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-colonization-of-ancient-greece-begin>When did the colonization of ancient Greece begin?</h2>
<p>Ancient Greek colonization began at an early date, during the so-called Geometric period of about 900 to 700 B.C. (74.51.965), when many seminal elements of ancient Greek society were also established, such as city-states, major sanctuaries, and the Panhellenic festivals.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-greeks-do-to-the-turks>What did the Greeks do to the Turks?</h2>
<p>It is further known for the ethnic cleansing against civilian Turks. Harold Armstrong, a British military official, reported that the Greek army went from Izmir to the interior of Anatolia, killing, burning, looting, and raping civilians.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-greek-soldiers-were-taken-in-the-greek-turkish-war>How many Greek soldiers were taken in the Greek-Turkish War?</h2>
<p>Lands initially ceded to the Kingdom of Greece from the Ottoman Empire are incorporated into the Republic of Turkey. * 20,826 Greek prisoners were taken. Of those about 740 officers and 13,000 soldiers arrived in Greece during the prisoner exchange in 1923. The rest presumably died in captivity and are listed among the “missing”.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-greeks-migrate-to-the-mediterranean>Why did the Greeks migrate to the Mediterranean?</h2>
<p>The extensive emigration of Greeks from their homeland in the Aegean begun in the mid-eight century and it continued for over two centuries. This expansion was driven by two major needs: to provide citizens of the motherland more fertile land and to satisfy the Greeks’ growing appetite for imported goods.</p>
