<h2 id=how-many-people-visit-mammoth-cave-a-day>How many people visit Mammoth Cave a day?</h2>
<p>4,000 people<br>
* Nearly 600,000 of those visitors take tours of the cave. * Close to 4,000 people take tours of the cave every day during the peak season.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-wear-to-mammoth-cave>What should I wear to Mammoth Cave?</h2>
<p>What should I wear in Mammoth Cave? Sturdy shoes or hiking boots are required. No sandals or bare feet are allowed in the caverns. Cave temperatures range from freezing to up to 60 degrees so a light jacket or cover is recommended.</p>
<h2 id=are-backpacks-allowed-in-mammoth-cave>Are backpacks allowed in Mammoth Cave?</h2>
<p>What can I bring with me into Mammoth Cave? You can bring camera gear but no tripods into the cave. Flashlights are allowed but can not be used during tour stops. No weapons, strollers, backpack child carriers are allowed in the cave.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-book-a-tour-of-mammoth-cave>How to book a tour of Mammoth Cave?</h2>
<p>No matter which Mammoth Cave tour you choose, make reservations in advance whenever possible. Tours frequently sell out. Search for Mammoth Cave National Park at <a href=http://www.recreation.gov>www.recreation.gov</a> to reserve your tour. Don’t limit your activities at Mammoth Cave National Park to underground cave tours.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-mammoth-cave-national-park-reopen>When does Mammoth Cave National Park reopen?</h2>
<p>This is expected to take 18 months, putting the estimated reopening to sometime in 2022 for some parts of the cave (the Wild Cave Tour and the Grand Avenue are currently closed). I do my best to keep this post updated, but tour offerings can change at any time and I recommend that you get updates on the national park service website.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-mammoth-cave-national-park-in-kentucky>Where is Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Mammoth Cave National Park is located in Kentucky. It is located roughly halfway between Nashville, Tennessee and Louisville, Kentucky. You can visit Mammoth Cave on a day trip from either of these cities, if you only plan to do a cave tour and walk a nature trail.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-you-not-wear-in-mammoth-cave>What should you not wear in Mammoth Cave?</h2>
<p>The clothes/shoes you wear in Mammoth Cave should not be worn in any other caves in the future. There is one lodge, two restaurants, and three campgrounds in the park. To make lodging reservations or to learn more about your options, click here. To preserve the cave, a few things are not permitted on the cave tours.</p>
