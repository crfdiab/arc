<h2 id=is-football-big-in-ireland>Is football big in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Football (the soccer kind) is very popular in Ireland. It’s the most played team sport in the country, for a start. The Irish national team almost always fails to qualify for the World Cup, but everyone supports them when they are in a major competition (most recently Euro 2016).</p>
<h2 id=when-have-ireland-won-the-world-cup>When have Ireland won the World Cup?</h2>
<p>The Republic of Ireland have never won the World Cup.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-oldest-football-club>What is the oldest football club?</h2>
<p>Sheffield F.C.<br>
Sheffield F.C. in England, is the world’s oldest surviving independent football club—that is, the oldest club not associated with an institution such as a school, hospital or university. It was founded in 1857.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-national-football-team-in-ireland>Is there a national football team in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Irish football possesses a complex history. Represented by the Republic of Ireland national football team and governed by the Football Association of Ireland, the sport is an incredibly popular piece of the nation’s culture. Beginning around 1882, the country possessed just one national team, run by the Irish Football Association (IFA).</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-irish-football-players>Why are there so many Irish football players?</h2>
<p>Contributing factors include: the amount of Irish fans, Irish players down through the years and the quality of those players. Overall, it comes down to a mixture of those three and which club has the greater Irish feel – as intangible as that quality is.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-popular-sport-in-ireland>Which is the most popular sport in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Only Gaelic football and hurling receive higher rankings. Ireland’s leagues have many teams but a few of the more popular would include the Shamrock Rovers, the Bohemians, and the St. Patrick’s Athletic, all of whom compete in the Republic.</p>
