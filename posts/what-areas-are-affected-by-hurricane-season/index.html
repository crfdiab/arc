<h2 id=where-do-hurricanes-usually-hit-and-why>Where do hurricanes usually hit and why?</h2>
<p>“Hurricanes form both in the Atlantic basin, to the east of the continental U.S. (that is, in the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea), and in the Northeast Pacific basin, to the west of the U.S. The hurricanes in the Northeast Pacific almost never hit the U.S., however, whereas the ones in the …</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-safest-place-to-go-in-a-hurricane>Where is the safest place to go in a hurricane?</h2>
<p>Stay inside and keep away from all windows, skylights and glass doors. Go to a safe area, such as an interior room, closet or downstairs bathroom. Never go outside the protection of your home or shelter before there is confirmation that the storm has passed the area.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-hurricanes-most-likely-to-occur-in-the-world>Where are hurricanes most likely to occur in the world?</h2>
<p>Countries all over the world are affected by hurricanes and cyclones, but those most affected include China, The Philippines, Japan, Mexico, the United States, Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Madagascar and Cuba. Hurricanes occur most often near shores and coastlines, especially where there is a lot of warm tropical water.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-some-cities-at-risk-for-hurricanes>Why are some cities at risk for hurricanes?</h2>
<p>“These cities are at risk mainly because they have large populations that are not often affected by hurricanes,” Brennan said. Compounding this lack of preparedness is the fact that storms tend to move quite fast once they reach these areas.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-worst-places-for-a-hurricane-to-hit>Where are the worst places for a hurricane to hit?</h2>
<p>Our list focuses on coastal areas, where the effects of a hurricane can be most catastrophic. In addition to the devastation caused by high winds of 200 mph or more, the ocean itself may be driven inland by the winds, creating a “storm surge”, a wall of water up to 20 feet high.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-hurricane-season-start-and-end>Where does the hurricane season start and end?</h2>
<p>Atlantic. During the peak season, hurricanes form in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. The most active period in the Atlantic starts from mid-August all through to late October. Some of the countries affected include Bermuda, eastern Canada, the Eastern coasts of the United States, and Central America (eastern Mexico).</p>
