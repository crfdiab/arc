<p>The massacre at Myall Creek was the culmination of a series of conflicts between settlers and Aboriginal people in the Liverpool Plains region. The twelve men responsible for the massacre included freed men and assigned convicts that had spent a day unsuccessfully pursuing Aboriginal people.</p>
<h2 id=what-europeans-were-involved-in-the-myall-creek-massacre>What Europeans were involved in the Myall Creek Massacre?</h2>
<p>On June 10th 1838, ten white Europeans and one black African in northern New South Wales killed 28 unarmed Aboriginal people in what became known as ‘The Myall Creek Massacre’.</p>

<p>Eventually the jury found them guilty of the murder of the child. On 18 December 1838 the seven stockmen were hanged. For only the second time in Australian history white men were punished for murder of Aboriginal people. But the NSW governor’s commitment to justice for Aboriginal people waned.</p>

<p>They were the first British subjects to be executed for massacring Aboriginal people. The Myall Creek massacre was neither the first nor last massacre of Aboriginal people in Australia but the NSW Supreme Court trials that followed set a judicial precedent. However, attitudes towards such massacres took longer to change.</p>

<p>Roger Milliss’ Waterloo Creek: The Australia Day Massacre of 1838 describes the Australia Day 1838 Waterloo Creek and Myall Creek massacres of Aboriginal people. It is easy to read and keeps you horrified and glued to it at the same time.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-henry-dangar-set-up-camp-at-myall-creek>Why did Henry Dangar set up camp at Myall Creek?</h2>
<p>Seven men were found guilty of murder and hung. In early May 1838, a group of about 40 Aboriginal people set up camp on Henry Dangar’s Myall Creek station. A posse of European stockmen and squatters arrived one day seeking revenge for cattle losses. The Aboriginal people at the property had no involvement in these attacks on stock.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-myall-creek-a-national-heritage-place>Why is Myall Creek a National Heritage Place?</h2>
<p>In memory of the Wirrayaraay people who were murdered on the slopes of this ridge in an unprovoked but premeditated act in the late afternoon of 10 June 1838. Erected on 10 June 2000 by a group of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians in an act of reconciliation, and in acknowledgment of the truth of our shared history.</p>
