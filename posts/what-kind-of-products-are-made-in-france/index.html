<h2 id=what-kind-of-products-are-made-in-france>What kind of products are made in France?</h2>
<p>A major producer of telecommunications equipment and communication satellites, France excels in manufacturing ships, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, textiles and automobiles. Cosmetics, perfume and wine are popular French products worldwide. France’s number one export industry is aerospace,…</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-do-they-eat-in-france>What kind of food do they eat in France?</h2>
<p>The way Thomas puts it, “the essence of eating like the French is to eat very well, but in moderation.” With an emphasis on fresh produce, whole grains, olive oil, fish, and some dairy and meat, the typical French diet sounds similar to a Mediterranean-type diet, which we all know is a natural anti-ager.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-natural-wonder-in-france>What is the name of the natural wonder in France?</h2>
<p>In French, the word ‘ pont ’ means bridge. This natural wonder is aptly named because that’s exactly what this stone archway looks like. Located in southern France, the Ardèche River eroded the stone over many years to create a hollow archway.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-famous-natural-feature-in-france>Which is the most famous natural feature in France?</h2>
<p>Some of the most iconic features of the cliffs include their three natural arches and the jagged ‘needle’ that emerges separately out of the Atlantic Ocean. The cliffs are made of white chalk, and they covered in a blanket of green grass and mosses.</p>

<h2 id=which-is-the-number-one-export-industry-in-france>Which is the number one export industry in France?</h2>
<p>Cosmetics, perfume and wine are popular French products worldwide. France’s number one export industry is aerospace, supported by the huge success of EADS, which produced Ariane space launch vehicles and Airbus planes, the aircraft builder Dassault and Safran, an engine manufacturer.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-buy-a-product-in-france>How do you buy a product in France?</h2>
<p>Consumers aged 25-34 order products online most frequently. When purchasing goods online, e-shoppers in France like to pay with credit cards (one of the most popular way to do so is with Carte-Bleue, a debit card that can also be used as a credit card). Other popular online payment methods in France are Visa and PayPal.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-love-about-made-in-france>What do you love about made in France?</h2>
<p>Welcome to Made in France Week. There’s so much to love about French stuff — from cuisine to art to style to sports (“Allez les bleus!”) to literature to beauty — that it’s not hard to see why Americans are so taken with French culture.</p>

<h2 id=what-are-the-four-categories-of-manufactured-goods>What are the four categories of manufactured goods?</h2>
<p>The Standard international trade classification (SITC) distinguishes four main groups (sections) of manufactured goods: miscellaneous manufactured articles (SITC 8). Categories 6 and 8 are often grouped together as ‘other manufactured goods’. This grouping is also used in this article.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-major-manufacturing-areas-in-france>Where are the major manufacturing areas in France?</h2>
<p>These industries are concentrated in the Paris region and in the southwest around Toulouse and Bordeaux. Food and beverage industries represent a large branch of French manufacturing, reflecting the considerable volume and diversity of agricultural production.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-france-import-from-other-countries>How much does France import from other countries?</h2>
<p>France imports different commodities from other countries. Some of the major import partners are represented in the chart (2005): In 2005, France imported goods worth US$471.36 billion and the exported goods worth US$439.22 billion. Within this same period, the services sector contributed a huge portion of its import and export activities.</p>
