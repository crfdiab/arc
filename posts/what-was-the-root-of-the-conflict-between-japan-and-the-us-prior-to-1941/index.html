<h2 id=what-was-the-root-of-the-conflict-between-japan-and-the-us-prior-to-1941>What was the root of the conflict between Japan and the US prior to 1941?</h2>
<p>The Roots of the Conflict To a certain extent, the conflict between the United States and Japan stemmed from their competing interests in Chinese markets and Asian natural resources. While the United States and Japan jockeyed peaceably for influence in eastern Asia for many years, the situation changed in 1931.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-going-on-between-the-us-and-japan-before-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor>What was going on between the US and Japan before the attack on Pearl Harbor?</h2>
<p>Before the Pearl Harbor attack, tensions between Japan and the United States had been mounting for the better part of a decade. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Japan sought to solve its economic and demographic woes by forcing its way into China, starting in 1931 with an invasion of Manchuria.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-us-declare-war-on-japan-in-1941>Why did the US declare war on Japan in 1941?</h2>
<p>On this date, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, addressing the nation in a Joint Session in the House Chamber, asked Congress to declare war against Japan in response to the surprise attack against American naval facilities in and around Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, a day earlier. …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-the-us-and-japan-during-world-war-2>What was the relationship between the US and Japan during World War 2?</h2>
<p>During World War II, diplomatic relations between the United States and Japan were severed in the context of the war that followed Japan’s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. After years of fighting in the Pacific region, Japan signed an instrument of surrender in 1945.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-normal-diplomatic-relations-between-japan-and-the-us-reestablished>When was normal diplomatic relations between Japan and the US reestablished?</h2>
<p>Normal diplomatic relations were reestablished in 1952, when the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, which had overseen the postwar Allied occupation of Japan since 1945, disbanded. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States was signed in 1960.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-us-do-to-japan-after-pearl-harbor>What did the US do to Japan after Pearl Harbor?</h2>
<p>In light of such atrocities, the United States began passing economic sanctions against Japan, including trade embargoes on aircraft exports, oil and scrap metal, among other key goods, and gave economic support to Guomindang forces.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-united-states-and-japan-do-together>What do the United States and Japan do together?</h2>
<p>The United States and Japan cooperate on a broad range of global issues, including development assistance, global health, environmental and resource protection, and women’s empowerment. The countries also work together to promote integrity in Information and Communications Technology supply chains and to ensure a secure transition to 5G networks.</p>
