<h2 id=what-classes-do-veterinarians-take-in-college>What classes do veterinarians take in college?</h2>
<p>Veterinary medical colleges typically require applicants to have taken many science classes, including biology, chemistry, anatomy, physiology, zoology, microbiology, and animal science. Discover some of the courses you will take pursuing a degree in Veterinary Science.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-you-have-to-be-in-college-to-be-a-veterinarian>How long do you have to be in college to be a veterinarian?</h2>
<p>four years<br>
Aspiring vets can expect to devote about eight years to their higher education if they spend four years in college and four years in vet school earning a doctor of veterinary medicine, or D.V.M., degree.</p>
<h2 id=what-category-does-veterinarian-fall-under-in-college>What category does veterinarian fall under in college?</h2>
<p>Since most pre-veterinary students are interested in the biological sciences and/or in working with animals, they tend to major either in sciences applied to working with animals (e.g., animal sciences, wildlife biology) or in basic sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, zoology).</p>
<h2 id=is-vet-school-hard>Is vet school Hard?</h2>
<p>Compared to most undergraduate curriculums, veterinary school is hard. Most veterinary students take 25-30 credits per semester of rigorous science-based courses. This means that veterinary students can expect to be in a classroom or laboratory 35 to 40 hours per week, and will need to study several hours more.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-increase-my-chances-of-getting-into-vet-school>How can I increase my chances of getting into vet school?</h2>
<p>Give yourself the best chance of being admitted</p>
<ol>
<li>Grades. Duh, you say.</li>
<li>Prerequisites. You could have a 4.0 GPA and still not get into veterinary school if you haven’t completed the prerequisites required for admission.</li>
<li>Experience.</li>
<li>Leadership skills.</li>
<li>Communication skills.</li>
<li>Letters of recommendation.</li>
<li>Standardized tests.</li>
<li>Have fun!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=is-med-school-harder-than-vet-school>Is med school harder than vet school?</h2>
<p>Getting Into Vet School Is Marginally Easier Overall, getting into vet school is slightly easier than medical school, because of the lower competition (but it’s still cutthroat). Both require you to work hard in order to join them. While getting into vet school might be easier, it depends on each specific school.</p>
<h2 id=is-becoming-a-vet-worth-it>Is becoming a vet worth it?</h2>
<p>Veterinary medicine is an extremely popular career choice in the animal industry, even though it requires a challenging, demanding education. It can be difficult to get accepted to vet school, but it can be well worth the effort in the long term.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-hardest-class-in-vet-school>What is the hardest class in vet school?</h2>
<p>First semester anatomy was the hardest class I ever had in vet school, and it’s the first thing you take. You’ve got a couple hours of lectures and then you’re spending another 6 – 9 hours in the lab every week. And that’s not counting any additional time you want to spend in there to study.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-easiest-veterinary-school-to-get-into>What is the easiest veterinary school to get into?</h2>
<p>The easiest vet school to get into in the world are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Western University of Health Sciences.</li>
<li>Tuskegee University.</li>
<li>Oklahoma State University.</li>
<li>Oregon State University.</li>
<li>University of Illinois–Urbana-Champaign.</li>

<p>The Arkansas Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) adds that formal academic programs for vet techs started in the 1960s, whereas in the past, many of these professionals learned their skills on-the-job. Currently in AR, there is one accredited, on-campus training program available, as well as several online programs.</p>
