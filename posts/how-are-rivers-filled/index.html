<h2 id=how-are-rivers-filled>How are rivers filled?</h2>
<p>A river forms from water moving from a higher elevation to a lower elevation, all due to gravity. When rain falls on the land, it either seeps into the ground or becomes runoff, which flows downhill into rivers and lakes, on its journey towards the seas. Rivers eventually end up flowing into the oceans.</p>
<h2 id=do-all-rivers-come-from-snow>Do all rivers come from snow?</h2>
<p>As much as 75 percent of water supplies in the western states are derived from snowmelt. During certain times of the year water from snowmelt can be responsible for almost all of the streamflow in a river. An example is the South Platte River in Colorado and Nebraska.</p>
<h2 id=do-lakes-feed-into-rivers>Do lakes feed into rivers?</h2>
<p>Open and closed lakes refer to the major subdivisions of lakes – bodies of water surrounded by land. Exorheic, or open lakes drain into a river, or other body of water that ultimately drains into the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-large-river-have-a-large-impact-on-the-weather>Can a large river have a large impact on the weather?</h2>
<p>The short answer: No, outside of the immediate vicinity of the major river it does not have a large impact on the weather of a larger area. Rivers create something called a microclimate, which means that the large river has an impact on an area of no more than a few hundred meters.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-water-in-a-stream-when-it-rains>What happens to the water in a stream when it rains?</h2>
<p>Rain that falls on a parking lot that has been baking in the sun all day during summer gets super heated and then runs off into streams. This heated water can be a shock to the aquatic life in the stream and can, thus, harm the water quality of the stream.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-volume-of-water-affect-the-temperature-of-a-river>How does volume of water affect the temperature of a river?</h2>
<p>With increased volume and turbidity, the range of variations is reduced. These may be about 6° C. in small streams in the summertime, with lower values being observed in larger rivers. Also, in small streams, the deeper the water the less is the daily variation.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-snowmelt-water-affect-the-water-temperature>How does snowmelt water affect the water temperature?</h2>
<p>For instance, during spring, snowmelt water may keep the temperature below that of the air for quite some time. Also, sunshine after a heavy rain has been observed to raise water temperatures presumably because water from the warm soil was continuing to flow into the stream.</p>
