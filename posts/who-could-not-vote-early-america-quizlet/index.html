<h2 id=who-could-not-vote-early-america-quizlet>Who could not vote early America quizlet?</h2>
<p>Women and most African Americans were not allowed to vote, nor were white males who did not own property or pay taxes. In some colonies, only members of the dominant religious group could vote. Since there were so many restrictions on who could vote, only 5-6% of the adult population were able to vote.</p>
<h2 id=when-united-states-was-founded-who-could-vote-quizlet>When United States was founded who could vote quizlet?</h2>
<p>Many Americans think voting is an automatic right, something that all citizens over the age of 18 are guaranteed. But this has not always been the case. When the United States was founded, only white male property owners could vote.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-want-in-a-colonial-meeting-house>What did people want in a colonial meeting house?</h2>
<p>In the early 19th century, people wanted “modern” churches that had one entrance on a short end of the building, a long aisle to a pulpit on the other short end, and slip pews instead of box pews. The colonial meeting house was the central focus of every New England town. These structures were usually the largest building in the town.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-do-in-the-gaol-in-colonial-america>What did people do in the gaol in colonial America?</h2>
<p>People were held in the gaol while they awaited their trials or punishment. Prisoners might include criminals, debtors, and runaway slaves. The magazine was a building designed to hold the town’s weapons including muskets, swords, pikes, and gunpowder.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-idea-of-a-town-meeting-come-from>Where did the idea of a town meeting come from?</h2>
<p>The town records of early New England are scarce, leading to debate about the origin of the town meeting. The most common interpretation is that they were adapted from local vestry meetings held in 17th century England, which were responsible for local government financial decisions of the parish church.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-people-go-to-church-in-colonial-america>Where did people go to church in colonial America?</h2>
<p>The church was often the center of the town. Everyone in the town was expected, sometimes by law, to attend church on Sunday. Churches in Colonial America were generally fairly simple buildings.</p>
