<h2 id=why-are-lorries-parked-on-the-m20>Why are lorries parked on the M20?</h2>
<p>Operation Stack is a procedure used by Kent Police and the Port of Dover in England to park (or “stack”) lorries on the M20 motorway in Kent when services across the English Channel, such as those through the Channel Tunnel or from the Port of Dover, are disrupted, for example by bad weather, industrial action, fire or …</p>
<h2 id=how-many-lorries-are-parked-on-m20>How many lorries are parked on M20?</h2>
<p>“We have been able to reduce the number of lorries waiting on the M20 from 500 to 170,” he went on.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-lorries-are-on-the-m20>How many lorries are on the M20?</h2>
<p>900 lorries<br>
Highways England confirms there were 900 lorries on the M20 on Monday evening – LBC.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-operation-brock-on-the-m20>What is Operation Brock on the M20?</h2>
<p>Operation Brock covers a 16-mile stretch of the motorway, between Maidstone and Ashford in Kent. The barriers allow lorries heading to Dover to use one side of the M20. The M20 will return to three wide lanes in both directions, and the national speed limit will be restored.</p>
<h2 id=is-operation-stack-on-the-m20-today>Is Operation Stack on the M20 today?</h2>
<p>Operation Stack is now in place on the coastbound carriageway of the M20 between Junctions 8 and 9 due to industrial action in Calais.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-has-operation-stack-been-used>How often has operation stack been used?</h2>
<p>Between 1996 and the end of 2007 Operation Stack was implemented 95 times for a total of 145 days. And it has been used intermittently since 2007 but rarely for more than a few hours or a day or two at a time.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-is-operation-stack-used>How often is Operation Stack used?</h2>
<p>In 2015, for the first time, a fourth phase was introduced, which some reports suggest allowed a further 1,600 lorries to be stacked. Operation Stack was first implemented in 1988, but it was used most intensively in summer 2015. It was in operation, intermittently, for most of July 2015.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-problems-on-the-m20>Are there any problems on the M20?</h2>
<p>Location : The M20 westbound entry slip at junction J5 . Reason : Roadworks are planned. Status : Pending. Schedule : Expect disruption everyday between 20:00 and 06:00 from 28 July 2021 to 31 July 2021.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-operation-brock-in-place>Why is Operation Brock in place?</h2>
<p>We aim to reopen the M20 to run as normal from 8am on Sunday 1 August. When there’s any sort of disruption in the channel, HGV traffic on the M20 heading for the Port of Dover or the Eurotunnel has nowhere to go. That’s why there’s now a contraflow system in place, that we call ‘Brock’, which can be set up overnight.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-operation-stack-in-place-today>Why is Operation Stack in place today?</h2>
<p>Operation Stack is back in place today (September 24) eight days after similar work caused chaos on Kent’s road. This is due to industrial action in Calais. It is a procedure used by the police and the port to essentially park traffic when cross-Channel services are severely disrupted.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-op-stack-on>Why is OP stack on?</h2>
<p>Operation Stack is a procedure that uses parts of the M20 to queue lorries travelling towards the continent, to avoid causing gridlock across Kent’s roads. It is used in emergency situations when crossings to the continent cannot happen, such as bad weather or industrial action.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-operation-tap-on>Why is Operation tap on?</h2>
<p>What is TAP? Road bosses instigate Operation TAP (Traffic Assessment Project) when there’s a large amount of freight traffic accessing the Port. Highways England says it helps manage local and port traffic better.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-5-mile-lorry-queues-in-kent>Where are the 5 mile lorry queues in Kent?</h2>

<h2 id=are-there-queues-on-the-m25-in-january>Are there queues on the M25 in January?</h2>
<p>The queues give a glimpse of things to come in January whether a deal is reached or not with the government last month warning of queues of 7,000 lorries on the main motorway routes to both Eurotunnel and Dover ferries in the worst-case scenario.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-portaloos-on-the-motorways>Why are there portaloos on the motorways?</h2>
<p>Tuesday’s Brexit tests come a day after the UK government confirmed it would be shipping portaloos to the motorways as a “reactive” plan when long queues occur. It decided against installing them on a longer term basis because of risk of drivers needing a convenience break stopping to use them when traffic is flowing at normal levels.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-a-delay-at-kent-port>Why was there a delay at Kent port?</h2>
<p>A spokesman for Highways England said they had been told a new trial software for border checks, with all HGVs been checked from 6am until 3pm, was responsible for the delay. “On a conference call chaired by Kent Police at 16.00 we were informed that the trial has now finished and traffic is now free flowing within the port.</p>
