I saw Patrick up close when he won the Cup in 1993 with Montreal and I was coaching Los Angeles. How did Jonathan Roy get traded from Montreal?</h2>
<p>It was that catalyst that saw the legendary goalie get traded from Montreal. The wise veteran of the Canadian music industry had never had a meeting like it. Holed up in a small Toronto hotel conference room with a few other well-tuned ears, Corey Hart had someone special to show Steve Waxman, Warner Music’s national publicity director.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-patrick-roys-son-jonathan-do-for-charity>What did Patrick Roy’s son Jonathan do for charity?</h2>
<p>Jonathan Roy will donate $5,000 to five local charitable organizations and will not have a criminal record. Roy, a former goaltender for the Quebec Remparts, was charged with assault following a brawl with opponent Bobby Nadeau during a March 2008 Quebec Major Junior Hockey League game.</p>

<p>After some artistic development in music’s AHL and a catchy single that literally sprung from a Corey Hart dream, however, Jonathan Roy has himself a radio hit.</p>
