<h2 id=what-cps-consider-abuse>What CPS consider abuse?</h2>
<p>“Any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation, or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm.”</p>
<h2 id=what-would-be-considered-parental-neglect>What would be considered parental neglect?</h2>
<p>Neglect is the failure to provide for or meet a child’s basic physical, emotional, educational, and medical needs. In physical neglect, parents or caregivers may fail to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, supervision, and protection from potential harm. …</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-cps-have-to-close-a-case-in-ny>How long does CPS have to close a case in NY?</h2>
<p>Although it depends on the particulars of the case, CPS usually has about 45 days to complete an investigation. If an investigation takes longer than this time, CPS has to notify the parents with reasons for its delay.</p>
<h2 id=can-cps-spy-on-you>Can CPS spy on you?</h2>
<p>You can sue CPS in their Official and Individual Capacity. They do spy on you. Whoever said they don’t has not been in a BenchMark Meeting where the Caseworker said she found your Facebook Post in a Group. Another thing they do to Parents is Predictive Negligence at every 45 day Benchmark Meeting before the court date.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-tell-social-services-to-go-away>Can I tell social services to go away?</h2>
<p>Some have asked ” can I tell social services to go away ” – If you tell them to go away, they won’t and you will end up in Court and there is then the risk that your children really will be removed. Be Honest.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-child-protection-agencies-in-new-york>Who are the child protection agencies in New York?</h2>
<p>In New York City, the local child protection agency is the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS). Initially, ACS does not decide whom to investigate. When someone calls in a report of suspected child abuse or neglect, ACS begins its investigation. ACS’ mission is “to ensure the safety and well-being of all the children of New York.”</p>
<h2 id=where-to-find-new-york-county-department-of-social-services>Where to find New York County Department of Social services?</h2>
<p>You may also find a listing for your county Department of Social Services in the blue pages of government office listings in your phone book. If you live in New York City, you should look for the listings of the Human Resources Administration.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-child-have-their-own-bedroom-in-a-non-custodial-home>Can a child have their own bedroom in a non custodial home?</h2>
<p>Ideally, kids have their own bedroom or one that they share with siblings in the home that they spend the majority of their overnights. Sometimes a question arises about whether a child needs to have their own separate bedroom at a non-custodial parent’s home as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-rights-of-residents-in-new-york>What are the rights of residents in New York?</h2>
<p>(4) The facility shall communicate to the resident an explanation of his or her responsibility to obey all reasonable regulations of the facility and to respect the personal rights and private property of other residents.</p>
