<h2 id=what-is-a-rainbow-in-a-cloud-called>What is a rainbow in a cloud called?</h2>
<p>A rainbow cloud can occur because of something called cloud iridescence. It usually happens in altocumulus, cirrocumulus, lenticular and cirrus clouds. When sunlight passes through raindrops in the sky, the light is split into the colors the rainbow.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-rainbow-classified-as>What is a rainbow classified as?</h2>
<p>A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky. It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-rainbow-a-circle-or-an-arc>Is a rainbow a circle or an arc?</h2>
<p>Rainbows are actually full circles. The antisolar point is the center of the circle. Viewers in aircraft can sometimes see these circular rainbows. Viewers on the ground can only see the light reflected by raindrops above the horizon.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-a-rainbow-an-arc>Why is a rainbow an arc?</h2>
<p>If we draw rays of sunlight that reflect at 42 degrees into your eyes then those rays start to look like they form a circular arc in the sky. So the reflection gives you the shape of the rainbow, while the refraction gives you the colours of the rainbow.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-see-a-rainbow-cloud>What happens if you see a rainbow cloud?</h2>
<p>Bottom line: You might on occasion see a rainbow-like cloud. They’re fairly rare, but people do spot them, and we sometimes receive photos of them. They’re caused by the presence of very tiny ice crystals or water droplets in the air, which cause light to be diffracted (spread out). The 2019 lunar calendars are here!</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-rarest-rainbow>What is the rarest rainbow?</h2>
<p>Twinned rainbows The rarest type of rainbow start from the same base but them split along the arc to form a primary and secondary rainbow. Twinned rainbows are formed when sunlight is refracted after coming into contact with two rain showers which have different size of droplets from each other.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-a-rainbow-from-space>Can you see a rainbow from space?</h2>
<p>To see a rainbow in outer space is quite rare given the certain specific atmospheric conditions that have to all come together. This rainbow was captured above the Karmic line, which is 100 kilometres above sea level and which defines the point at which Earth’s atmosphere ends and space starts.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-rainbow-cloud-appear-in-the-sky>What makes a rainbow cloud appear in the sky?</h2>
<p>What is a rainbow cloud? A rainbow cloud can occur because of something called cloud iridescence. It usually happens in altocumulus, cirrocumulus, lenticular and cirrus clouds. Iridescent clouds happen because of diffraction – a phenomenon that occurs when small water droplets or small ice crystals scatter the sun’s light.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-rainbows-formed-and-how-are-they-formed>How are Rainbows formed and how are they formed?</h2>
<p>The formation of a rainbow involves physical phenomenon, which includes dispersion, refraction, reflection and total internal reflection. A Rainbow is formed due to sunlight and atmospheric conditions. Light enters a water droplet, slows down and bends as it goes from air to water, which is denser.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-you-see-rainbows-in-the-sky>Where do you See Rainbows in the sky?</h2>
<p>It usually happens in altocumulus, cirrocumulus, lenticular and cirrus clouds. It is the same basic concept as a rainbow: small water droplets or small ice crystals within the cloud scatter the Sun’s light. You’ve probably seen a rainbow before. When sunlight passes through raindrops in the sky, the light is split into the colors the rainbow.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-rainbows-the-result-of-refraction-and-reflection>How are Rainbows the result of refraction and reflection?</h2>
<p>Rainbows are the result of the refraction and reflection of light. Both refraction and reflection are phenomena that involve a change in a wave’s direction. A refracted wave may appear “bent”, while a reflected wave might seem to “bounce back” from a surface or other wavefront.</p>
