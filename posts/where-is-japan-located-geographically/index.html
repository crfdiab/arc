<h2 id=where-is-japan-located-geographically>Where is Japan located geographically?</h2>
<p>Asia<br>
Japan is an archipelago, or string of islands, on the eastern edge of Asia. There are four main islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. There are also nearly 4,000 smaller islands! Japan’s nearest mainland neighbors are the Siberian region of Russia in the north and Korea and China farther south.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-opposite-japan-on-the-globe>What is opposite Japan on the globe?</h2>
<p>The opposite side of the world to Tokyo is Cidreira, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-japan-so-mountainous>Why is Japan so mountainous?</h2>
<p>Mountains occupy over 80% of Japan’s landmass. Most of the mountains, such as the Japan Alps, were “uplifted” by the collision of the Pacific oceanic crust and continental crust of Asia. Some of Japan’s mountains are clearly volcanic, such as the iconic Mt. Fuji (12,385 ft.), which last erupted in 1707.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-is-on-the-opposite-side-of-japan>What country is on the opposite side of Japan?</h2>
<p>In geography, the antipode (/ˈæntɪˌpoʊd/ or /ænˈtɪpədiː/) of any spot on Earth is the point on Earth’s surface diametrically opposite to it….Countries.</p>
<table><tr><th>Country</th><th>No. of antipodal countries</th><th>Antipodal countries</th></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>2</td><td>(Ryukyu) Brazil, Paraguay</td></tr><tr><td>South Korea</td><td>2</td><td>Uruguay, Brazil</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=which-is-on-the-other-side-of-the-earth>Which is on the other side of the Earth?</h2>
<p>An antipode is a point that is on the exact opposite side of the earth (or other sphere) from a given location. If you drew a line (vector) from your location to the center of the earth and continued that line until it emerged from the other side of the earth’s surface, that point of intersection on the other side is the antipode.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-state-of-japan-located-in-the-world>Where is the state of Japan located in the world?</h2>
<p>Japan (Japanese: 日本 Nippon [ɲippoɴ] or Nihon [ɲihoɴ]; formally 日本国 Nippon-koku or Nihon-koku, meaning “State of Japan”) is a sovereign island nation in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies off the eastern coast of the Asian mainland and stretches from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and China in the southwest.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-exact-opposite-side-of-the-world-from-you>Where is the exact opposite side of the world from you?</h2>
<p>“Digging a hole to China” might be a favorite childhood pastime, but, perhaps not surprisingly, it’s not actually geographically accurate. The point opposite you on Earth, which is about 20,000 kilometers away, is almost certainly in the ocean. This is true not just if you live in North America, but virutally anywhere on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-people-on-the-other-side-of-the-world>Are there people on the other side of the world?</h2>
<p>For some reason it’s akin to a long-lost pen pal, many of us have wondered what or whom lives on the other side of this massive earth. With a nifty tool called the Antipodes Map you can now know exactly where you’d end up on the other side of the world.</p>
