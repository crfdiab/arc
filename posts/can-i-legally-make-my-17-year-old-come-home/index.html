<p>• 16 and 17 year-olds Over 16s can leave home without the consent of parents or carers. A parent can try to force the young person to return home but a court would be unlikely to make them return against their will.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-two-minors-have-a-baby>What happens if two minors have a baby?</h2>
<p>Having sex with someone below the age of consent is statutory rape — a crime. In general, when two minors under the age of consent engage in “consensual” sex with one another, they are both open to statutory rape charges.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-a-17-year-old-gets-pregnant>What happens if a 17 year old gets pregnant?</h2>
<p>Teens are at a higher risk for pregnancy-related high blood pressure (preeclampsia) and its complications than average age mothers. Risks for the baby include premature birth and low birth weight. Preeclampsia can also harm the kidneys or even be fatal for mother or baby.</p>
<h2 id=who-can-be-guardian-of-a-minor>Who can be guardian of a minor?</h2>
<p>Natural Guardian: The natural guardians of a Hindu, minor, in respect of the minor’s person as well as in respect of the minor’s property (excluding his or her undivided interest in joint family property), are – (a) in the case of a boy or an unmarried girl—the father, and after him, the mother: provided that the …</p>
<h2 id=what-age-are-you-not-a-minor>What age are you not a minor?</h2>

<h2 id=how-easy-is-it-to-get-pregnant-at-17>How easy is it to get pregnant at 17?</h2>
<p>A sexually active teen who doesn’t use contraceptives has a 90% chance of becoming pregnant within a year. More than half of all mothers on welfare had their first child as a teenager. In fact, two-thirds of families begun by a young, unmarried mother are poor.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-21-year-old-get-a-17-year-old-pregnant>Can a 21 year old get a 17 year old pregnant?</h2>
<p>Yes, so long as the relationship is not sexual. If they have sexual intercourse, the 21-year-old can face criminal charges for statutory rape if they are not married.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-wife-be-a-guardian>Can a wife be a guardian?</h2>
<p>of a minor who is a married female and whose husband is not, in the opinion of the Court, fit to be guardian of her person, or. of a minor whose father is living and is not, in the opinion of the court, fit to be guardian of the person of the minor.</p>
