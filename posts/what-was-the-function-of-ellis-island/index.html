<p>Ellis Island is a historical site that opened in 1892 as an immigration station, a purpose it served for more than 60 years until it closed in 1954. Located at the mouth of Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, Ellis Island saw millions of newly arrived immigrants pass through its doors.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-function-of-ellis-island-while-it-was-open>What was the function of Ellis Island while it was open?</h2>
<p>The first inspection station opened in 1892 and was destroyed by fire in 1897. The second station opened in 1900 and housed facilities for medical quarantines and processing immigrants. After 1924, Ellis Island was used primarily as a detention center for migrants.</p>
<h2 id=how-has-ellis-island-played-an-important-role-in-american-history>How has Ellis Island played an important role in American history?</h2>
<p>It served as the nation’s major immigration station from 1892 to 1924, after which its role was reduced; during that period an estimated 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island, where they were processed by immigration authorities and obtained permission to enter the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-ellis-island-have-in-new-york-city>What impact did Ellis Island have in New York City?</h2>
<p>Ellis Island is undoubtedly a significant milestone in the study of the new population masses of New York. As the first port of entry for the arriving masses, it inadvertently harbors the answers to most of the questions concerning the first wave of immigrants to the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-ellis-island-after-1924>What was the purpose of Ellis Island after 1924?</h2>
<p>After 1924, the only passengers brought to Ellis Island were those who had problems with their paperwork, as well as war refugees and displaced persons needing assistance. Ellis Island remained for three more decades serving a multitude of purposes, including a World War II detention center for enemy merchant seamen.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-arrive-at-ellis-island>Who was the first person to arrive at Ellis Island?</h2>
<p>Annie Moore, a teenage girl from Ireland, accompanied by her two younger brothers, made history as the very first immigrant to be processed at Ellis Island. Over the next 62 years, more than 12 million immigrants would arrive in the United States via Ellis Island.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-they-use-interpreters-at-ellis-island>Why did they use interpreters at Ellis Island?</h2>
<p>This document was used by the legal inspectors at Ellis Island to cross-examine during the legal inspection. Contrary to popular belief, interpreters of all major languages were employed at Ellis Island, making the process efficient and ensuring that records were accurate.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-was-the-ellis-island-inspection-process>How long was the Ellis Island inspection process?</h2>
<p>If an immigrant’s papers were in order and they were in reasonably good health, the Ellis Island inspection process lasted 3 to 5 hours. The inspections took place in the Registry Room (Great Hall) where doctors would briefly scan every individual for obvious physical ailments.</p>
