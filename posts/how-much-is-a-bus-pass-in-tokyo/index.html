<h2 id=how-expensive-is-public-transport-in-japan>How expensive is public transport in Japan?</h2>
<p>Within Tokyo or the largest cities of Japan, assuming you aren’t going on day trips, you typically don’t spend more than 1000 to 1500 Yen daily on transport. If you travel more than that as a visitor to the city, you are likely trying to hit too many places in one day.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-bus-ticket-in-tokyo-in-us-dollars>How much is a bus ticket in Tokyo in US dollars?</h2>
<p>The fare between main tourist cities around Tokyo: 4,1 – 4,2 USD = 450 – 460 JPY. Kamakura 60 min 8,1 USD = 890 JPY. Osaka Shinkansen – 3 hours 126,6 USD = 14 000 JPY Night Bus 36,2 – 72,4 USD = 4 000 – 8 000 JPY.</p>
<h2 id=at-what-age-do-you-get-a-free-bus-pass-in-the-uk>At what age do you get a free bus pass in the UK?</h2>
<p>60<br>
In England you can get a bus pass for free travel when you reach the State Pension age. If you live in London, you can travel free on buses, tubes and other transport when you’re 60, but only within London. In Wales you can get a bus pass when you reach 60.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-get-a-tokunai-pass>How do I get a Tokunai pass?</h2>
<p>The Tokyo Metropolitan District Pass or Tokunai Pass can be purchased 30 days in advance, but I don’t think it’s necessary. Tickets can be purchased on the spot from regular ticket machines around all stations. Head to the marked ticket machine to purchase the Tokunai Pass. Change the interface to English first.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-cheaper-in-japan-bus-or-train>Which is cheaper in Japan bus or train?</h2>
<p>Highway buses are one of the most economical ways to travel medium to long distances in Japan. While slower than trains, buses cost usually less than half, especially on the competitive Tokyo routes where discount fares can be incredibly low.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-use-my-free-bus-pass-anywhere-in-the-uk>Can I use my free bus pass anywhere in the UK?</h2>
<p>Where you can use your pass. You can travel for free anywhere in England, including London on local bus services. It’s not valid for journeys within Scotland or Wales. Free travel is not available on tourist buses or coach services like megabus.com and National Express.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-get-free-train-travel-at-60>Do you get free train travel at 60?</h2>
<p>Under normal operational circumstances, 60+ London Oyster photocard scheme entitles Londoners to free travel on all TfL services and some national rail services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, from their 60th birthday.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-buy-a-japan-bus-pass>Where can I buy a Japan bus pass?</h2>
<p>The Japan Bus Pass can be purchased on the Willer Express website. Payment by most major credit cards is accepted. The Japan Bus Pass is a pass for long distance travel in Japan for budget travelers who do not mind sleeping on the bus.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-ride-a-bus-in-japan>How much does it cost to ride a bus in Japan?</h2>
<p>When riding a bus in Japan, cash or an IC card like a Suica is necessary. The buses in Tokyo’s 23 districts have a pay first policy where you pay the bus fare when entering from the front door of the bus. Within Tokyo’s 23 wards the bus fare is 210 yen (IC card 206 yen) for adults and 110 yen (IC card 103 yen) for children.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-bus-pass-from-tokyo-to-hiroshima>How much is a bus pass from Tokyo to Hiroshima?</h2>
<p>If used effectively, it can reduce the cost of transportation to very low levels, e.g. around 3,000 yen for a trip from Tokyo to Hiroshima (a regular train ticket costs around 18,000 yen). The pass is a particularly good offer since it can be used on non-consecutive days and because overnight travel also reduces the cost for accommodation.</p>

<p>Check out Japan Rail (JR) Passes: The Ultimate Guide. Will a Japan Rail Pass Save You Money? A JR pass must be used on consecutive days within its allotted timeframe. That means a 7-day pass must be used in 7 days – after that, it will no longer be valid.</p>
