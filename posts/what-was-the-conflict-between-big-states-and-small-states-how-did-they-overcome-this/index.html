<h2 id=what-was-the-conflict-between-big-states-and-small-states-how-did-they-overcome-this>What was the conflict between big states and small states how did they overcome this?</h2>
<p>The Great Compromise settled the method of representation in the legislative branch (the US Congress). Small states wanted equal representation (equality by state), and large states wanted representation based on population (equality by vote). Under the compromise, all states were represented equally in the Senate.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-conflict-between-the-large-states-and-the-small-states-in-the-crafting-of-the-constitution-center-on>What did the conflict between the large states and the small states in the crafting of the constitution center on?</h2>
<p>The conflict between the large states and the small states in the crafting of the Constitution centered on how to best represent the interests of the people and the states in the legislature. The system of checks and balances keeps each branch from abusing their power and dominating the other two branches.</p>
<h2 id=what-compromise-was-reached-between-big-states-and-small-states>What compromise was reached between big states and small states?</h2>
<p>The Connecticut Compromise<br>
The Connecticut Compromise (also known as the Great Compromise of 1787 or Sherman Compromise) was an agreement that large and small states reached during the Constitutional Convention of 1787 that in part defined the legislative structure and representation that each state would have under the United States …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-greatest-limit-on-the-power-of-the-federal-government>What is the greatest limit on the power of the federal government?</h2>
<p>Federal power is limited. If there is no interstate commerce involved and the matter does not involve individual rights under the Constitution, the states have the right to control their affairs. The federal government also has very limited authority to commandeer state personnel to enforce federal law.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-great-compromise-used-today>How is the Great Compromise used today?</h2>
<p>The agreement, which created today’s system of congressional representation, now influences everything from “pork barrel” legislation to the way votes are counted in the electoral college during presidential elections. The debate almost destroyed the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-compromise-satisfy-both-small-and-large-states>How did the Great Compromise satisfy both small and large states?</h2>
<p>Eventually, Roger Sherman suggested the Great Compromise, which offered a two-house Congress to satisfy both small and big states. Each state would have equal representation in the Senate, or upper house. Voters of each state would choose members of the House. The state legislatures would choose members of the Senate.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-difference-between-small-and-big-states-in-1787>What was the difference between small and Big States in 1787?</h2>
<p>Big States vs. Small States, 1787. Thanks to — or sometimes no thanks to — the Connecticut Compromise, reached during the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the U.S. government has both a House of Representatives and a Senate. But it was a bit of a slog to reach the agreement.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-some-smaller-states-not-join-the-union>Why did some smaller states not join the Union?</h2>
<p>That didn’t sit well with less populous states like Delaware, which were afraid that they would be overshadowed by states with larger populations. Another plan, this time from New Jersey, proposed a legislature with a single house. That was also a no go.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-conflict-not-an-armed-conflict>What makes a conflict not an armed conflict?</h2>
<p>Location refers to the state (s) where the main violence takes place, not to the warring parties. Italics indicate disputed territories and unrecognized states. A territorial dispute or a protest movement which has not experienced deliberate and systemic deaths due to state or paramilitary violence is not considered to be an armed conflict.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-a-conflict-between-federal-and-state-marijuana-laws>Why is there a conflict between federal and state marijuana laws?</h2>
<p>Federal officials—the president, regulators and, most importantly, Congress—must take ownership over a system of disconnected laws and policies. Federalism is a system that can work quite well, yet current drug policy shows precisely how a patchwork of temporary fixes can lead to profound confusion and unintended consequences.</p>
