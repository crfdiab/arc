<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-tobacco-and-slavery>What is the relationship between tobacco and slavery?</h2>
<p>This system assisted in the development of major settlements at Norfolk, Alexandria, and Richmond. Tobacco formed the basis of the colony’s economy: it was used to purchase the indentured servants and slaves to cultivate it, to pay local taxes and tithes, and to buy manufactured goods from England.</p>
<h2 id=did-slaves-cultivate-tobacco>Did slaves cultivate tobacco?</h2>
<p>Tobacco was also tended by enslaved Africans, who were forcibly brought in significant numbers to Virginia starting in 1619. The need for fertile soil on which to grow the year’s crop required that the planter own large tracts of land, which had to be arduously cleared and prepared as field.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-tobacco-so-important-in-the-south>Why was tobacco so important in the South?</h2>
<p>Tobacco became so important, that it was used as currency, to pay taxes, and even to purchase slaves and indentured servants. Others worked as indentured servants. Indentured servants came to America to work for seven years.</p>
<h2 id=what-role-did-the-tobacco-play-in-jamestown>What role did the tobacco play in Jamestown?</h2>
<p>The Jamestown colonists found a new way to make money for The Virginia Company: tobacco. The demand for tobacco eventually became so great, that the colonists turned to enslaved Africans as a cheap source of labor for their plantations.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-slavery-on-the-tobacco-industry>What was the impact of slavery on the tobacco industry?</h2>
<p>However, once the slave population increased so dramatically, the environment for slaves on tobacco plantations was much less hospitable. Slaves had grown to be around 40% of the population surrounding Chesapeake, which inevitably made the racial boundaries on tobacco plantations more distinct and harmful.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-author-of-tobacco-and-slaves>Who was the author of tobacco and slaves?</h2>
<p>Tobacco and Slaves: The Development of Southern Cultures in the Chesapeake, 1680–1800, is a book written by historian Allan Kulikoff. Published in 1986, it is the first major study that synthesized the historiography of the colonial Chesapeake region of the United States.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-tobacco-grown-in-the-american-colonies>Why was tobacco grown in the American colonies?</h2>
<p>Tobacco Plantations. Tobacco has been grown in the Americas for at least two millennia, but European colonization created the conditions for the emergence of cultivators that specialized in large-scale tobacco production. While staple crops such as sugar were readily identified with slave labor in the American colonies,…</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-a-slave-boom-in-the-chesapeake>Why was there a slave boom in the Chesapeake?</h2>
<p>The slave boom that occurred in Chesapeake as a result of tobacco’s popularity dramatically shifted the previous dynamic between slaves and slaveowners on tobacco plantations. Cultivating tobacco is a multi-step process that involves skilled workers strenuous labor.</p>
