<h2 id=why-america-should-not-have-dropped-the-atomic-bomb>Why America should not have dropped the atomic bomb?</h2>
<p>Reasons Against Dropping the Atomic Bomb — Argument 3: Use of the Atomic Bombs Was Racially Motivated. Opponents of President Truman’s decision to use the atomic bomb argue that racism played an important role in the decision; that had the bomb been ready in time it never would have been used against Germany.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-arguments-for-dropping-the-atomic-bomb>What are the arguments for dropping the atomic bomb?</h2>
<p>REASONS IN FAVOR OF THE ATOMIC BOMBING OF JAPAN</p>
<ul>
<li>It led to a quick end to World War II.</li>
<li>It saved the lives of American soldiers.</li>
<li>It potentially saved the lives of Japanese soldiers and civilians.</li>
<li>It forced Japan to surrender, which it appeared unwilling to do.</li>
<li>It was revenge for Japan’s attack at Pearl Harbor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-was-it-right-for-the-us-to-bomb-japan>Why was it right for the US to bomb Japan?</h2>
<p>The dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima was justified at the time as being moral – in order to bring about a more rapid victory and prevent the deaths of more Americans. However, it was clearly not moral to use this weapon knowing that it would kill civilians and destroy the urban milieu.</p>
<h2 id=was-america-justified-in-dropping-the-atomic-bomb-on-japan-essay>Was America justified in dropping the atomic bomb on Japan essay?</h2>
<p>6 and 9, 1945, the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Despite U.S. claims to the contrary, these actions were neither justified nor decisive in Japan’s surrender. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the previous carpet bombing of 66 other Japanese cities, were not the reason Japan surrendered.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-we-bomb-hiroshima-and-not-tokyo>Why did we bomb Hiroshima and not Tokyo?</h2>
<p>One (big) reason was because Hiroshima and Nagaski were two cities left in a very small pool which had not been bombed yet. Tokyo, as well as many of Japan’s other major cities, had already been heavily damaged by previous bombings.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-feel-the-united-states-was-justified-in-using-atomic-weapons-to-end-wwii>Do you feel the United States was justified in using atomic weapons to end WWII?</h2>
<p>“No. The dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima was justified at the time as being moral – in order to bring about a more rapid victory and prevent the deaths of more Americans. However, it was clearly not moral to use this weapon knowing that it would kill civilians and destroy the urban milieu.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-main-arguments-against-dropping-the-atomic-bomb-on-japan>What were the main arguments against dropping the atomic bomb on Japan?</h2>
<p>REASONS AGAINST THE ATOMIC BOMBING OF JAPAN</p>
<ul>
<li>It was inhumane.</li>
<li>It caused too much destruction.</li>
<li>It killed too many innocent people, including children.</li>
<li>It was unnecessary as Japan was essentially defeated.</li>
<li>Japan was seeking surrender.</li>
<li>It was not universally supported in the United States.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=did-einstein-regret-creating-the-atomic-bomb>Did Einstein regret creating the atomic bomb?</h2>
<p>Einstein regretted the letter. In a 1947 Newsweek article headlined “The Man Who Started It All,” he was quoted as saying, “Had I known that the Germans would not succeed in producing an atomic bomb, I would never have lifted a finger.”</p>
<h2 id=what-did-paul-fussell-feel-towards-the-dropping-of-the-atomic-bomb>What did Paul Fussell feel towards the dropping of the atomic bomb?</h2>
<p>The American cultural and literary historian, Paul Fussell, was un- apologetic in his support for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As for Japan, there is no question in his mind that the bomb was necessary, a case he lays out in his famous essay from 1981, ‘Thank God for the Atomic Bomb’.</p>
