The White House was the largest house in the United States until after the Civil War. The construction of the White House started in 1792 and it was first occupied by President John Adams in 1800.</p>
<h2 id=has-any-president-not-lived-in-the-white-house>Has any president not lived in the White House?</h2>
<p>Construction began when the first cornerstone was laid in October of 1792. Although President Washington oversaw the construction of the house, he never lived in it. It was not until 1800, when the White House was nearly completed, that its first residents, President John Adams and his wife, Abigail, moved in.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-white-house-painted-white>Why was the White House painted white?</h2>

<h2 id=when-was-the-first-white-house-built>When was the first White House built?</h2>
<p>The house was designed by Irish-born James Hoban and built between 1792 and 1800 of white-painted Aquia Creek sandstone in the Neoclassical style.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-white-house-get-its-name>How did the White House get its name?</h2>
