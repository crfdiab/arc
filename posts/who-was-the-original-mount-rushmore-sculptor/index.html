<p>Historian Doane Robinson conceived the idea for Mount Rushmore in 1923 to promote tourism in South Dakota. In 1924, Robinson persuaded sculptor Gutzon Borglum to travel to the Black Hills region to ensure the carving could be accomplished.</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt’s face<br>
Theodore Roosevelt’s face was the last to be carved on Mount Rushmore. The Roosevelt carving was dedicated on July 2, 1939.</p>

<p>Mount Rushmore National Memorial is centered on a colossal sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in Keystone, South Dakota.

<p>Borglum later requested that Isabella Greenway—by the mid-1930s a member of Congress, representing Arizona—be added to the Rushmore Memorial Commission. She was the only woman. Borglum could have continued with commissions such as these, but then came an opportunity of a lifetime: the chance to sculpt a mountain.</p>
