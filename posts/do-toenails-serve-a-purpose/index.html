<h2 id=do-toenails-serve-a-purpose>Do toenails serve a purpose?</h2>
<p>Why do we have toenails? The main function of toenails is likely for protection, compared to enhancing grip or the fine motor functions the fingernails have. The tops of the toes are vulnerable to injury and, as we’ve all learned the hard way, stubbing.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-human-nails-so-weak>Why are human nails so weak?</h2>
<p>Dry and brittle nails are the result of too little moisture. They’re most commonly caused by the repeated washing and drying of fingernails. On the other hand, soft and brittle nails are caused by too much moisture, often a result of overexposure to detergents, household cleaners, and nail polish remover.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-humans-get-fingernails>When did humans get fingernails?</h2>
<p>Early Homo sapiens first started using stone tools around 2.5 million years ago. In response to this tool use, our hands have fingernails that are even broader than their predecessors.</p>
<h2 id=why-dont-humans-have-claws>Why don’t humans have claws?</h2>
<p>It is because we humans developed complex social structures and can rely on others for grooming, finds a study. But the ancestors of monkeys, apes and humans lost their grooming claws, possibly because they have each other, the researchers said.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-toenails-thicken-with-age>Why do toenails thicken with age?</h2>
<p>With age, there is a rapid decrease in the growth rate for both toenails and fingernails, said Dr. Richard K. Scher, head of the nail section at Weill Cornell Medical College. As a result, both kinds of nail thicken, because of the piling up of nail cells, called onychocytes.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-have-my-toenails-removed>Can I have my toenails removed?</h2>
<p>The entire nail or only part of the nail can be removed. Surgical nail removal can be done in your doctor’s office. Your doctor will give you an injection in the finger or toe to prevent pain.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-eat-to-strengthen-my-nails>What should I eat to strengthen my nails?</h2>
<p>Plenty of nutrients in food can help your nails, taking them from dry and brittle to healthy and strong. Foods that can improve your nails include fruits, lean meats, salmon, leafy greens, beans, eggs, nuts, and whole grains.</p>
<h2 id=are-humans-supposed-to-cut-their-nails>Are humans supposed to cut their nails?</h2>
<p>Whether from hunting, walking, scratching, breaking, etc. While we don’t NEED to cut them, it’s sanitary and can POSSIBLY cause problems if left unchecked. They could grow at a weird angle, into the skin. Hope this helps!</p>
<h2 id=do-humans-need-nails>Do humans need nails?</h2>
<p>The short answer is we have evolved to have nails because they help us pick things up (like food), pick things off (like bugs), and hold tightly onto things. Early humans who had these type of nails (instead of claws) tended to live long enough to have babies and pass on the fingernails gene to their kids.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-nails-grow-from>Where do nails grow from?</h2>
<p>nail root<br>
Nails start in the nail root, hidden under the cuticle. When cells at the root of the nail grow, the new nail cells push out the old nail cells. These old cells flatten and harden, thanks to keratin, a protein made by these cells. The newly formed nail then slides along the nail bed, the flat surface under your nails.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-white-hard-stuff-under-my-toenails>What is the white hard stuff under my toenails?</h2>
<p>Keratin is a protein that promotes the development of the skin and nails. Nail psoriasis sometimes causes too much keratin to grow under the nail. This overgrowth is called subungual hyperkeratosis. People with hyperkeratosis may notice a white, chalky substance under the nail.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-have-nails-in-our-fingernails>Why do we have nails in our fingernails?</h2>
<p>According to an anthropology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, fingernails are present in all primates, including humans, monkeys, and apes, to support our fingertips. When taking…</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-humans-dont-have-fingernails>What happens if humans don’t have fingernails?</h2>
<p>What if Humans Didn’t Have Nails? Beyond the fact that nails salons across the globe would cease to exist, if humans did not have fingernails or toenails, we’d simply have an area of soft skin at the end of our fingers. This would make it difficult to hold and grip objects and leave room for bacteria to grow as well.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-humans-start-using-fingernails-and-toenails>When did humans start using fingernails and toenails?</h2>
<p>This means that regardless of whether an animal has claws or fingernails, they basically serve the same purpose. Around the time when early Homo sapiens first started using stone tools around 2.5 million years ago, their fingertips started becoming even broader than their predecessors.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-have-fingernails-in-all-primates>Why do we have fingernails in all primates?</h2>
<p>According to an anthropology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, fingernails are present in all primates, including humans, monkeys, and apes, to support our fingertips. When taking proportions into account, our fingertips are wider on average than those of most other primates.</p>
