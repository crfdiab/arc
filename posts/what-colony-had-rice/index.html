<h2 id=what-colony-had-rice>What Colony had rice?</h2>
<p>The South Carolina and Georgia colonists ultimately adopted a system of rice cultivation that drew heavily on the labor patterns and technical knowledge of their African slaves.</p>
<h2 id=in-which-region-of-the-original-13-colonies-did-the-colonists-grow-rice>In which region of the original 13 colonies did the colonists grow rice?</h2>
<p>The cash crops of the southern colonies included cotton, tobacco, rice, and indigo (a plant that was used to create blue dye). In Virginia and Maryland, the main cash crop was tobacco. In South Carolina and Georgia, the main cash crops were indigo and rice.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-rice-grown-in-the-colonies>Where was rice grown in the colonies?</h2>
<p>The economy of the Lower South—North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia—was based upon plantation agriculture in the eighteenth century. The Carolinas were settled in the 1660s but did not find a profitable export until the 1690s when rice was established as the staple crop.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-slaves-grow-rice>How did the slaves grow rice?</h2>
<p>In the spring, slaves would plant the rice seeds. Then the fields would be flooded, allowing the rice to sprout. After this, the growing area would be drained and then hoed. This process of flooding and then hoeing would take place repeatedly, usually four or five times.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-order-of-the-13-colonies>What was the Order of the 13 colonies?</h2>
<p>The 13 original colonies in chronological order start with Virginia, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maryland and Connecticut. The colonies of Rhode Island, Delaware, North Carolina, South Carolina and New Jersey follow.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-13-colonies-fight-in-the-revolutionary-war>Where did the 13 colonies fight in the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>The 13 colonies were one of the many nations who fought in the Revolutionary War in the late 18th century. The 13 colonies were established in North America by Great Britain during the 17th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-first-five-colonies>What was the name of the first five colonies?</h2>
<p>Rhode Island was established by Roger Williams in 1636, with the establishment of Delaware by Peter Minuit two years later.The next five colonies were established over a 30-year period, beginning with North Carolina in 1653 and proceeding to William Penn’s creation of Pennsylvania in 1682.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-the-thirteen-colonies-in-1775>What was the population of the Thirteen Colonies in 1775?</h2>
<p>By 1775, on the eve of revolution, there were nearly 2.5 million. These colonists did not have much in common, but they were able to band together and fight for their independence.</p>
