<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-organisation-that-regenerated-the-london-docklands>What was the name of the Organisation that regenerated the London Docklands?</h2>
<p>The London Docklands Development Corporation<br>
The London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) was a quango agency set up by the UK Government in 1981 to regenerate the depressed Docklands area of east London.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-london-docklands-built>When was the London Docklands built?</h2>
<p>The London Docks were one of several sets of docks in the historic Port of London. They were constructed in Wapping, downstream from the City of London between 1799 and 1815, at a cost exceeding £5½ million. Traditionally ships had docked at wharves on the River Thames, but by the late 1700s more capacity was needed.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-the-london-docklands-regenerated>How were the London Docklands regenerated?</h2>
<p>Access to the London Docklands was improved with the creation of the DLR making access to the Docklands easier and quicker. The creation of jobs in the local area. Most New jobs area transfers from outside the area.</p>
<h2 id=who-built-canary-wharf>Who built Canary Wharf?</h2>
<p>Paul Reichmann<br>
1987: Canary Wharf is created by Paul Reichmann, Canadian property tycoon after being approached by Michael Heseltine. Paul Reichmann had already developed a similar project in New York City and agreed generous tax breaks with Margaret Thatcher beforehand. 1988: Construction of Canary Wharf begins.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-docklands>What is the meaning of Docklands?</h2>
<p>British. : the part of a port occupied by docks also : a residential section adjacent to docks.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-london-docks-used-for-now>What are the London docks used for now?</h2>
<p>Most of the docks themselves have survived and are now used as marinas or watersports centres; a major exception is the Surrey Commercial Docks, which are now largely filled in. Although large ships can—and occasionally still do—visit the old docks, all of the commercial traffic has moved downriver.</p>
<h2 id=is-canary-wharf-a-good-area-to-live-in>Is Canary Wharf a good area to live in?</h2>
<p>Canary Wharf is a very safe area. There is very little crime compared to other areas in London. Residents report that they feel perfectly comfortable walking through the area alone at night. In fact, Canary Wharf is regularly rated as one of the safer areas in London, by both police and independent evaluators.</p>
