<h2 id=what-does-the-bull-symbolize-in-spain>What does the bull symbolize in Spain?</h2>
<p>“Sometimes the bull is seen as a symbol of Spain, as a symbol of the virtues and the values of Spain and Spanish culture,” says Failing. “Sometimes the relationship is one of gender and a sort of masculine force and feminine force. Sometimes it’s a relationship of aggressor to something more passive.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-bull-so-important-to-spain>Why is the bull so important to Spain?</h2>
<p>The bull itself was seen as a mythological god in the Iberian culture, with the bullfight being the religious drama where a God, the bull, is adorned and sacrificed for humanities salvation. The first bullfight was held in Spain in 1107 in Avila.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-unofficial-national-bull-of-spain>Which is the unofficial national Bull of Spain?</h2>
<p>Toro de Osborne, the Spanish unofficial national bull. A 14-metre black silhouette of a bull called Toro de Osborne (The Osborne bull) is a unofficial national symbol of Spain.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-osborne-bull-become-a-symbol-of-spain>How did the Osborne bull become a symbol of Spain?</h2>
<p>That is what is known as the Osborne bull, and it is the unofficial symbol of Spain. These came about as advertising for the Osborne sherry company, who started to put these bulls up by major roads in Spain in 1956 to advertise their “Brandy de Jerez”. The originals were black with red advertising on them, but slightly smaller in size.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animal-is-the-national-animal-of-spain>What kind of animal is the national animal of Spain?</h2>
<p>The national animal of Spain is the bull. Bulls are an important symbol in Spanish culture, especially in traditions, such as bullfighting and the Running of the Bulls. The Running of the Bulls, or “encierro,” is part of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona that takes place each July in honor of the patron saint San Fermin.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spanish-government-save-the-bulls>How did the Spanish government save the Bulls?</h2>
<p>The Spanish government planned to tear them down, but a public outcry ensued and a ‘save the bulls’ campaign launched. The bulls had become such an entrenched part of Spanish culture, the government eventually agreed to keep them, but all advertising was blacked out.</p>
