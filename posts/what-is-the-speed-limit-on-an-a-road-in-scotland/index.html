<h2 id=what-is-the-speed-limit-on-an-a-road-in-scotland>What is the speed limit on an A road in Scotland?</h2>
<p>Scottish speed limits Single carriageways: 60 mph (97 km/hr) Motorways and dual carriageways: 70 mph (113 km/hr)</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-open-road-speed-limit-in-the-uk>What is the open road speed limit in the UK?</h2>
<p>70mph<br>
Speed Limits for Cars, Bikes and Vans Out on the open road, the speed limit is 70mph. This applies to dual carriageways and motorways. For single carriageways, the speed limit is 60mph. If you’re towing a trailer, the speed limit is reduced by 10mph.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-find-out-the-speed-limit-on-a-uk-road>How do I find out the speed limit on a UK road?</h2>
<p>On UK roads, maximum speed limits are indicated by roadside signs which show the number on a circular sign with a red border. These signs are shown as you enter a new limit and may be displayed at intervals along the road – either on lamp posts or free-standing poles for single carriageway or dual carriageways.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-speed-limit-for-a-35-tonne-van>What is the speed limit for a 3.5 tonne van?</h2>
<p>Speed limits for vans Vans weighing up to 3.5 tonnes must keep to the following speed limits: 30mph in built-up areas. 50mph on single carriageways. 60mph on dual carriageways.</p>
<h2 id=is-driving-too-slow-illegal-in-uk>Is driving too slow illegal in UK?</h2>
<p>Is driving too slowly illegal in the UK? While there is no law for driving too slowly, the police can charge you for “driving without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other road users”. There are no exceptions where a non-emergency vehicle can break speed limits on UK roads.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-break-the-speed-limit-to-overtake-uk>Can you break the speed limit to overtake UK?</h2>
<p>SPEEDING while overtaking another vehicle can land you with a hefty fine and points on your licence. And you could even be hit with a lengthy driving ban if you break the speed limit when passing another motor. Under Rule 163 of the Highway Code, drivers should only overtake when it’s safe and legal to do so.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-drive-a-35-ton-van-on-a-car-licence>Can I drive a 3.5 ton van on a car Licence?</h2>
<p>Driving most vans is pretty simple, so if you have a full, B category car license, you’re permitted to drive any van weighing up to 3.5 tonnes. Well, vans are split into different weight categories called gross vehicle weight (GVW).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-speed-limit-in-scotland>What is the average speed limit in Scotland?</h2>
<p>Scottish speed limits In the UK, speed limits are posted as miles per hour (mph): Urban areas: general speed limit is 20 or 30 mph (48 km/hr) Single carriageways: 60 mph (97 km/hr)</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-drive-at-20mph-in-edinburgh>Is it safe to drive at 20mph in Edinburgh?</h2>
<p>A speed limit is the maximum speed that should be driven on that road; it does not mean it is always safe to drive at this speed in all conditions. More than 80% of Edinburgh’s roads, including the whole of the city centre, are to have a 20mph speed limit under council plans.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-local-council-set-a-speed-limit>Can a local council set a speed limit?</h2>
<p>As well as the national speed limit local councils can set their own speed limits for certain circumstances. These may include a 20mph limit in built-up area near a school, or a lower speed limit for a particularly dangerous section of a road such as a sharp bend. How are Speed Limits Enforced?</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-maximum-speed-you-can-drive-in-the-uk>What’s the maximum speed you can drive in the UK?</h2>
<p>The speed limit is the absolute maximum – it doesn’t mean it’s safe to drive at this speed in all conditions. A speed limit of 30 miles per hour ( mph) or 48 kilometres per hour ( km/h) usually applies, unless you see signs showing otherwise. Vehicles under 2 tonnes laden (loaded) weight may qualify as a ‘car-derived van’ or ‘dual-purpose vehicle’.</p>
