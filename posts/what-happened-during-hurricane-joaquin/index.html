<h2 id=what-caused-hurricane-damage>What caused hurricane damage?</h2>
<p>Most people believe that wind causes the most damage during a hurricane. However, it is a combination of wind, storm surge, and inland flooding that causes the major damage. Under normal weather conditions, the wind blows across the Earth’s surface from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.</p>

<h2 id=why-did-el-faro-sail-straight-into-hurricane-joaquin>Why did El Faro sail straight into Hurricane Joaquin?</h2>
