<h2 id=what-is-a-traveler-ireland>What is a traveler Ireland?</h2>
<p>About Irish Travellers Travellers are an indigenous minority who, historical sources confirm, have been part of Irish society for centuries. Travellers long shared history, cultural values, language, customs and traditions make them a self-defined group, and one which is recognisable and distinct.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-you-an-irish-traveller>What makes you an Irish Traveller?</h2>
<p>Irish Travelers, also known as “White Gypsies,” are members of a nomadic ethnic group of uncertain origin. Scholars often speculate that they are descended from a race of pre-Celtic minstrels and that their ranks were swelled by displaced farmers during Oliver Cromwell’s bloody campaigns of the mid-1600s.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-gypsy-and-a-traveller>What is the difference between a Gypsy and a Traveller?</h2>
<p>Gypsies and Travellers are two distinct societies. While both are nomadic peoples, the two societies have totally different origins, culture, language, and physical profile. The Gypsies are generally found in Eastern Europe while the Travellers usually walk inside the territories of Ireland, UK, and the Americas.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-irish-travelers-do-for-a-living>What do Irish Travelers do for a living?</h2>
<p>Their primary trade is repair work, often categorized as dubious in nature (though the fairness of that generalization has been called into question). But the US Irish Travellers have also, over the years, amassed fortunes through a unique internal economy based on life insurance policies.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-traveller-girl>What is a Traveller girl?</h2>
<p>Traveller girls are often taken out of education prior to secondary school to prevent them mixing with boys from other cultures. They’re not supposed to marry non-travellers but marriage to second cousins in families is common. Once married, the man rules the roost.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-gypsy-last-names>What are Gypsy last names?</h2>
<p>Common Gypsy names. You may have Gypsy ancestry if your family tree includes common Gypsy surnames such as Boswell, Buckland, Codona, Cooper, Doe, Lee, Gray (or Grey), Hearn, Holland, Lee, Lovell, Smith, Wood, Young and Hearn.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-irish-travelers-cover-their-windows>Why do Irish Travelers cover their windows?</h2>
<p>“They said the Travellers cover their windows with aluminum and do idol worship. Police routinely characterize the Irish Travellers from South Carolina and elsewhere in the U.S. as con men and scam artists.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-people-are-the-irish-travellers>What kind of people are the Irish Travellers?</h2>
<p>About Irish Travellers. Travellers are an indigenous minority who, historical sources confirm, have been part of Irish society for centuries. Travellers long shared history, cultural values, language, customs and traditions make them a self-defined group, and one which is recognisable and distinct.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-irish-travellers-become-a-minority>When did the Irish travellers become a minority?</h2>
<p>After a long battle, Irish Travellers were finally officially recognised as an indigenous ethnic minority by Ireland’s government in early March 2017. Here, Culture Trip takes a look at the origins of the Irish Travelling community and how the historic ruling came about.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-travellers-and-what-do-they-do>Who are the travellers and what do they do?</h2>
<p>Travellers are an indigenous minority who, historical sources confirm, have been part of Irish society for centuries. Travellers long shared history, cultural values, language, customs and traditions make them a self-defined group, and one which is recognisable and distinct.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-language-does-an-irish-traveller-speak>What kind of language does an Irish Traveller speak?</h2>
<p>Irish Travellers speak English and sometimes one of two dialects of Shelta, Gammon (or Gamin) and Irish Traveller Cant. Shelta has been dated back to the 18th century, but may be older. Cant, which derives from Irish, is a combination of English and Shelta.</p>
