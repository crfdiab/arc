<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-great-leap-forward-plan-quizlet>What was the impact of the Great Leap Forward plan quizlet?</h2>
<p>The Great Leap Forward began in 1958. During this time, grain production fell from 200 million tons to 150 million tons. This resulted in widespread famine.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-goals-of-the-great-leap-forward>What were the goals of the Great Leap Forward?</h2>
<p>The central idea behind the Great Leap was that rapid development of China’s agricultural and industrial sectors should take place in parallel. The hope was to industrialize by making use of the massive supply of cheap labour and avoid having to import heavy machinery.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-great-leap-forward-lead-to-famine>How did Great Leap Forward lead to famine?</h2>
<p>The major contributing factors in the famine were the policies of the Great Leap Forward (1958 to 1962) and people’s communes, such as inefficient distribution of food due to the planned economy, requiring the use of poor agricultural techniques, the Four Pests Campaign that reduced bird populations (which disrupted …</p>

<h2 id=who-first-said-look-before-you-leap>Who first said look before you leap?</h2>
<p>Of course, the phrase “look before you leap” goes as far back as at least 1350 (see the illuminated manuscript at the right). It’s first known English citation is within an a collection of proverbs by John Heywood in 1546, and it’s first use in the United States was in 1677 in the History of Indian Wars in New England.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-great-leap-forward>What was the impact of the Great Leap Forward?</h2>
<p>In Hebei, for example, the Provincial Committee of the Party boldly announced: “The great achievements of the overall leap forward have educated the masses and educated the cadres.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-china-during-the-great-leap-forward>Who was the leader of China during the Great Leap Forward?</h2>
<p>Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist revolutionary and leader, c1950s. Kallie Szczepanski has a Ph.D. in history and has taught at the college and high school level in both the U.S. and Korea.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-collectivisation-important-in-the-great-leap-forward>Why was collectivisation important in the Great Leap Forward?</h2>
<p>Collectivised farms would better organise peasant labour, eliminate waste and inefficiency and greatly increase production. Cooperatives and collectivisation had been encouraged during the mid-1950s but it was not until the Great Leap Forward that the ‘people’s communes’ became official government policy.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-steel-production-target-during-the-great-leap-forward>What was the steel production target during the Great Leap Forward?</h2>
<p>The doubling of steel production was another of Mao’s ambitions during the Great Leap Forward. Steel targets further escalated during this period. In 1957, the annual steel production target was 5.35 million tonnes but by May 1958 Mao called for the target to be raised to 10.7 million tonnes.</p>
