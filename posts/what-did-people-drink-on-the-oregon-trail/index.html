<h2 id=what-did-people-drink-on-the-oregon-trail>What did people drink on the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>But neither answers the critical question: What did the Pilgrims drink? There was no California Pinot Noir for the first revelers – there wasn’t even a California. Beer, cider and spirits, with alcohol levels that kept bacteria at bay, were safe choices.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-apple-vinegar-used-for-on-the-oregon-trail>What was Apple vinegar used for on the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>It has been used to preserve food for centuries. Without the aid of modern refrigeration a lot of food was pickled to preserve it for future use. Vinegar is antibacterial, anti fungal and antiseptic. It is great for eczema, sunburn and digestive issues.</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-were-found-on-the-oregon-trail>What animals were found on the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>From bison to threatening rattlesnakes, travelers reported seeing a variety of wildlife along the Oregon Trail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bison.</li>
<li>Pronghorns.</li>
<li>Snakes.</li>
<li>Prairie Dogs.</li>
<li>Rabbits.</li>
<li>Coyotes.</li>
<li>Beavers.</li>
<li>Prairie Grass.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-did-the-pioneers-eat-on-the-oregon-trail>What did the pioneers eat on the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>The pioneers often ate beans for breakfast. They were relatively quick to make. People simply added them to a big pot with water. Although raw beans lasted for a long time, cooked beans spoiled quickly. So everyone had to enjoy them quickly. That suited the travelers because breakfast needed to wrap up by 4 A.M.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-oregon-trail-start-in-1843>Where did the Oregon Trail start in 1843?</h2>
<p>Then on May 22, 1843, a group of around 1,000 people – men, women, and children – packed into 120 wagons, rounded up 5,000 livestock animals, and headed from Elm Grove, MO, to Oregon. They wanted the chance to claim their own land.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-sugar-did-they-carry-on-the-oregon-trail>What kind of sugar did they carry on the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>Travelers mostly carried brown sugar, which went through fewer processes than white sugar, so it was cheaper. However, it still contained molasses, which could make the sugar run in the hot sun. Consequently, they sometimes added crushed sugar to get them through the latter part of the journey.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-original-purpose-of-the-oregon-trail>What was the original purpose of the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>The Oregon Trail (series) The original game was designed to teach school children about the realities of 19th-century pioneer life on the Oregon Trail. The player assumes the role of a wagon leader guiding a party of settlers from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon ‘s Willamette Valley via a covered wagon in 1848.</p>
