<h2 id=does-new-hampshire-have-a-good-economy>Does New Hampshire have a good economy?</h2>

<p>New Hampshire is best known for its great supply of fish and lumber, however furs, salt, and livestock can also be found in New Hampshire. Most colonists make products out of these resources such as axes, knives, pots, blankets, and clothing.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-did-the-new-hampshire-settlers-eat>What kind of food did the New Hampshire settlers eat?</h2>
<p>Fish, whales, fur, and timber were important natural resources for the New Hampshire colony. Much of the land was rocky and not flat, so agriculture was limited. For sustenance, settlers grew wheat, corn, rye, beans and various squashes.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-household-income-in-new-hampshire>What’s the average household income in New Hampshire?</h2>
<p>Despite these historic challenges, overall, compared to the rest of the country, New Hampshire’s economy is still considered robust. Among other things, the state boasts one of the highest median household incomes in the country, $61,042. But talking about New Hampshire’s economy as a whole is tricky business.</p>
