<h2 id=what-type-of-boat-did-henry-hudson-have>What type of boat did Henry Hudson have?</h2>
<p>He was provided a small, nimble vessel called the Halve Maen (Half Moon). Hudson and the Half Moon, with a total crew of 17 (13 of them Dutch) left Amsterdam in April.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-voyages-did-henry-hudson-fail>How many voyages did Henry Hudson fail?</h2>
<p>two unsuccessful<br>
Believed to have been born in the late 16th century, English explorer Henry Hudson made two unsuccessful sailing voyages in search of an ice-free passage to Asia. In 1609, he embarked on a third voyage funded by the Dutch East India Company that took him to the New World and the river that would be given his name.</p>
<h2 id=did-henry-hudson-die-at-sea>Did Henry Hudson die at sea?</h2>
<p>Hudson was never heard from again after a mutiny by his crew during a later voyage through northern Canada. That he died in the area in 1611 is a certainty, and he may have even been killed in cold blood, according to new research.</p>
<h2 id=did-henry-hudson-have-any-problems>Did Henry Hudson have any problems?</h2>
<p>Henry Hudson faced many different challenges. The worst hardship he faced was the ice that could crack the boat in half. Hudson on his first voyage went through a lot of fog. Fog is one of the worst things you can have if you are an explorer because you can not see where you are going.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-henry-hudsons-ships>What are the names of Henry Hudson’s ships?</h2>
<p>The Names of His Ships. Henry Hudson had a few ships. His first ship was, the Hopewell. His second and third ship was the Half Moon. His final ship was The Discovery.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-henry-hudson-sail-from-on-his-first-voyage>Where did Henry Hudson sail from on his first voyage?</h2>
<p>Henry Hudson made his first voyage west from England in 1607, when he was hired to find a shorter route to Asia from Europe through the Arctic Ocean. After twice being turned back by ice, Hudson embarked on a third voyage–this time on behalf of the Dutch East India Company–in 1609.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-henry-hudson-discover-the-hudson-river>When did Henry Hudson discover the Hudson River?</h2>
<p>His exploration of New York and his discovery of the Hudson River in 1609 led to the Dutch colonization in these areas. In 1625, the Dutch claimed their first colony, New Amsterdam, around this area. From there, the Netherlands continued to have an interest in colonizing North America.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-latitude-of-henry-hudsons-ship>What was the latitude of Henry Hudson’s ship?</h2>
<p>One was located around latitude 62° N (based on English explorer Captain George Weymouth’s 1602 voyage); the second, around latitude 40° N, had been recently reported by Captain John Smith.</p>
