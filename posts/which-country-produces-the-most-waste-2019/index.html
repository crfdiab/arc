<h2 id=which-country-produces-the-most-waste-2019>Which country produces the most waste 2019?</h2>
<p>Canada<br>
Largest waste producing countries worldwide per capita 2019 Worldwide, the biggest producer of waste per capita is Canada. At an estimated 36.1 metric tons per year, this was 10 metric tons more per capita than the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-is-the-least-wasteful>What country is the least wasteful?</h2>
<p>Armenia produces relatively little municipal waste, with nearly 493,000 tons in 2014. It also ranks among the countries producing the least amount of agricultural and construction waste.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-wasteful-state>What is the most wasteful state?</h2>
<p>California has more landfills than any other state in the nation — more than twice as many, in fact, as every other state except Texas.</p>
<h2 id=which-age-group-wastes-the-most-food>Which age group wastes the most food?</h2>
<p>Research shows that young people aged 18-34 waste proportionally more food than other age groups2. Students are a key audience within this age group, and in order to help them reduce their food waste, we need to gain a better understanding of what foods they are wasting, and why.</p>
<h2 id=is-coca-cola-a-polluter>Is Coca-Cola a polluter?</h2>
<p>In December 2020, following global clean ups and brand audits, Coca-Cola was named the world’s worst plastic polluter for the third year in a row. According to scientists, packaging already accounts for 40 percent of total plastic demand, and the industry would like nothing more than to increase that dependence.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-country-with-the-most-waste-in-the-world>Which is the country with the most waste in the world?</h2>
<p>Kuwait Kuwait is number one in the world at producing the most waste, generating 5.72 kilograms per capita per day of MSW. Its trash accumulation owes itself to the country lacking proper landfills to dispose of all the waste. However, the World Bank projects that by 2025, Kuwaitis will be generating less waste at 4 kilograms per capita per day.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-percentage-of-waste-in-the-united-states>What’s the percentage of waste in the United States?</h2>
<p>Alarmingly, the average American throws away nearly 7 pounds of trash on a daily basis, according to PlanetThoughts. The U.S. consumes 30 percent of the world’s resources despite making up only 5 percent of the world’s population. It also produces 30 percent of the world’s waste.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-largest-waste-producers-per-household>Where are the largest waste producers per household?</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, the largest waste producers per household are found in smaller geographic countries like Kuwait and Caribbean Island nations.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-most-of-the-worlds-trash-come-from>Where does most of the world’s trash come from?</h2>
<p>In the U.K., the amount of trash produced is even less than in Germany. Like Germans, the average British citizen produces less than 1/3 of the amount of trash produced by the average American. The United Kingdom’s 60 million people produce around 34.85 million tons of trash every year.</p>
