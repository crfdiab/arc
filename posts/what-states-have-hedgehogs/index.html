<h2 id=what-states-have-hedgehogs>What states have hedgehogs?</h2>
<p>In Pennsylvania – hedgehogs may not be imported into the state, but hedgehogs in the state as of 1992 and their descendants are allowed. It is currently illegal to own a hedgehog in California, Georgia, Hawaii, New York City, and Washington, D.C.</p>
<h2 id=does-north-america-have-wild-hedgehogs>Does North America have wild hedgehogs?</h2>
<p>Hedgehogs aren’t native to North America, but that hasn’t stopped the notorious pet trade from profiting from this exploited species. Although their small size may make them look cute and cuddly, “pocket pets” are wild animals who have very specific needs that the average person can’t meet.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-wild-hedgehogs-in-the-usa>Are there wild hedgehogs in the USA?</h2>
<p>There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five genera found throughout parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia and no living species native to the Americas (the extinct genus Amphechinus was once present in North America).</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-no-hedgehogs-in-north-america>Why are there no hedgehogs in North America?</h2>
<p>Hedgehogs are not native to North America. You haven’t seen them because no-one has done something stupid that would result in their introduction as a self-sustainable invasive species.</p>
<h2 id=can-hedgehogs-love-their-owners>Can hedgehogs love their owners?</h2>
<p>Do hedgehogs bond with their owners? Hedgehogs do bond with their owners when they get used to their owners scent. Baby hedgehogs bond quicker than older hedgehogs, who require more time and attention to get used to their owners. Depending on the hedgehog’s personality, some may also take longer to bond.</p>
<h2 id=do-female-hedgehogs-have-periods>Do female hedgehogs have periods?</h2>
<p>Hedgehogs DO have a ‘heat,’ or estrus cycle, and are not entirely induced ovulators as had been previously thought. The cycle is typically about 9 days on, followed by 7 days off, but is not absolute.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-own-a-hedgehog-in-new-york>Is it legal to own a Hedgehog in New York?</h2>
<p>, lived in New York. It depends where in New York you live. While hedgehogs are legal to own in the State of New York, they are not legal to own if you live within New York City (inclusive of the five burroughs).</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-hedgehogs-in-the-wild-in-north-america>Are there any hedgehogs in the wild in North America?</h2>
<p>There are no species of hedgehog living naturally in the wild in any of the Americas. The only hedgehogs living in North America are almost uniformly Central African hedgehogs (Atelerix Albiventris) and are the descendants of some 80,000 such hedgehogs that were imported into the United States pet trade from Lagos, Nigeria between 1991 and 1994.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hedgehogs-are-there-in-the-garden>How many hedgehogs are there in the garden?</h2>
<p>There are currently 0 holes mapped. There are currently 0 hedgehogs mapped. Loading…. Pledge to make a hole for hedgehogs in your garden boundary.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-african-pygmy-hedgehog-legal-in-new-england>Is the African pygmy hedgehog legal in New England?</h2>
