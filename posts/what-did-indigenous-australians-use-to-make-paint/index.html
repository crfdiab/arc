<p>Ochre<br>
Ochre used in Aboriginal paintings were usually dug or mined from places with a kind of soft colourful stone which is completely natural. There are a variety of colours that can be extracted and then mixed with other pigments to produce other colours/hues much like the way we mix acrylic colours to form other pigments.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-indigenous-make-paint>How did indigenous make paint?</h2>
<p>Aboriginal people collected pigments for painting. The artists made red, purple and yellow pigments from ochre clays (which are rich in iron), and white pigment from kaolin clay. They worked in the rock shelter, grinding up the ochre (usually with a stone on a grindstone slab) and adding water.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-aboriginal-body-paint-made-of>What is Aboriginal body paint made of?</h2>
<p>Aboriginals of Australia have traditionally been decorating their bodies and faces for tribal celebrations and occasions called Corroboree, with body paints. To make the paint, Aboriginal people used Ochre, Charcoal, animal fat and pigments extracted from leaves and flowers.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-aboriginal-artists-use-to-paint-with>What do Aboriginal artists use to paint with?</h2>
<p>Aboriginal Dot paintings are commonly executed in both Ochre paintings and Acrylics, however Acrylic paint is the more commonly used for these artworks. The paint used may be highly textured with a very raised surface or flat.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-aboriginal-dot-painting-called>What is Aboriginal dot painting called?</h2>
<p>This began the famous Papunya Tula Art Movement. They did not want them to understand or learn the sacred, restricted parts of their stories so the artists decided to eliminate the sacred elements and abstracted the designs into dots to conceal their sacred meanings.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-aboriginals-paint-their-faces>How do Aboriginals paint their faces?</h2>
<p>Mix one part ochre in glass jar with one part saliva or blood. Some traditional Aboriginal painters mixed the ochres with kangaroo blood. The saliva or blood will bind the pigment. This paint is ready to use.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-aboriginals-make-the-paint-they-used>How did Aboriginals make the paint they used?</h2>
