<h2 id=who-built-the-railroad-across-canada>Who built the railroad across Canada?</h2>
<p>In 1879, the federal government floated bonds in London and called for tenders to construct the 206 km (128 mi) section of the railway from Yale, British Columbia, to Savona’s Ferry, on Kamloops Lake. The contract was awarded to Andrew Onderdonk, whose men started work on 15 May 1880.</p>
<h2 id=who-decided-to-build-the-canadian-pacific-railway>Who decided to build the Canadian Pacific Railway?</h2>
<p>Macdonald. British Columbia had insisted upon a national railway as a condition for joining the Confederation of Canada. The government thus promised to build a railway linking the Pacific province to the eastern provinces within ten years of July 20, 1871.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-canadian-railway-built>When was Canadian railway built?</h2>
<p>February 16, 1881, Canada<br>
Canadian Pacific Railway/Founded</p>
<h2 id=how-many-chinese-workers-died-building-the-cpr>How many Chinese workers died building the CPR?</h2>
<p>Upward of 15,000 Chinese labourers helped to build the Canadian Pacific Railway. Working in harsh conditions for little pay, these workers suffered greatly and historians estimate that at least 600 died working on the railway.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-government-own-via-rail>Does the government own VIA Rail?</h2>
<p>VIA Rail today is a non-agent, independent Crown corporation. VIA Rail operates the national passenger rail service on behalf of the Government of Canada, providing intercity service and regional and essential remote rail transportation.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-cpr-railway-still-in-use>Is the CPR railway still in use?</h2>
<p>The Canadian Pacific Railway company (CPR) was incorporated in 1881. In 2001, Canadian Pacific separated into five separate and independent companies, with Canadian Pacific Railway returning to its origins as a railway company. CP, as it is branded today, has over 22,500 km of track across Canada and the United States.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-prime-minister-of-canada>Who was the first Prime Minister of Canada?</h2>
<p>In this inventive cartoon, Roy Peterson of the Vancouver Sun portrayed our first prime minister delivering a lesson in Canadian matters to America’s first president, George Washington. This is something that Canadians are always attempting to do with our neighbours to the south.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-prime-minister-of-canada-choose-his-cabinet>How does the Prime Minister of Canada choose his cabinet?</h2>
<p>The prime minister also chooses the ministers who make up the Cabinet. The two groups, with the authority of the Parliament of Canada, manage the Government of Canada and the Canadian Armed Forces.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-head-of-government-in-canada>Who is the head of government in Canada?</h2>
<p>The prime minister of Canada is an official who serves as the primary minister of the Crown, chair of the Cabinet, and thus head of government of Canada. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the Governor General of Canada, but by constitutional convention, the prime minister must have the confidence of the elected House of Commons.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-only-prime-minister-to-die-outside-of-canada>Who was the only prime minister to die outside of Canada?</h2>
<p>Only Bowell and the Viscount Bennett were given private funerals, Bennett also being the only former Prime Minister of Canada to die and be buried outside the country and Bowell the only whose funeral was not attended by politicians.</p>
