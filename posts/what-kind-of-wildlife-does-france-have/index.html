<h2 id=what-kind-of-wildlife-does-france-have>What kind of wildlife does France have?</h2>
<p>What animals live in France? France is particularly rich in rodents, shrews, moles, bats, deer, boar, carnivores (like badgers and weasels), song birds and water birds, insects, freshwater fish, and some species of frogs. Whales and dolphins can sometimes be seen off the coast as well.</p>
<h2 id=do-black-widows-live-in-france>Do black widows live in France?</h2>
<p>The European Black Widow Spider can be found in the south of France, Corsica and elsewhere along the Mediterranean. This black widow spider has a shiny black body, the juveniles and adult males of the species are characterised by the 13 spots which mark their backs.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-wildlife-is-found-in-france>What kind of wildlife is found in France?</h2>
<p>France has a great range of natural habitats, and the diverse environments lead equally to a great diversity in the wildlife to be found – some species are found quite generally across France while other species are restricted to quite restricted areas of mountains or other specialised environments.

<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-animals-in-france>Why are there so many animals in France?</h2>
<p>Later on, they made their way back to being a part of the wildlife of France from the Italian Alps, and are now mostly found in the French Alps, due to the fact that there is plenty of prey available and that they can live in peaceful coexistence with the other wildlife animals in the region.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-beautiful-animal-in-france>Which is the most beautiful animal in France?</h2>
<p>The lynx is one of the rarest and most beautiful animals in France, and is a species of wild cat. They are very shy and hard to spot, so if you would see one in the wild you would be very lucky. In France they live in high altitude forests with cover of shrubs, reeds and tall grass – where they can live a quiet and isolated life.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-foxes-in-the-woods-in-france>Are there foxes in the woods in France?</h2>
<p>There are many foxes in France, but it is rare to actually spot one in the woods as they are very isolated animals are extremely good at hiding. They live in the forests, and also can be found in almost any wildlife park in France.</p>
