<h2 id=which-geological-resource-most-likely-resulted-from-glaciation>Which geological resource most likely resulted from glaciation?</h2>
<p>Answer: Sand and gravel deposits.</p>
<h2 id=which-rock-is-usually-composed-of-several-minerals>Which rock is usually composed of several minerals?</h2>
<p>Granite is composed of several minerals, which gives it it’s speckled appearance. Limestone is a rock composed of a single mineral. On the basis of their origin on earth, rocks may be divided into three primary categories: igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-most-igneous-sedimentary-and-metamorphic-rocks-have-in-common>What do most igneous sedimentary and metamorphic rocks have in common?</h2>
<p>What do most igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks have in common? 1) They are formed from molten material. 2) They are produced by heat and pressure. 3) They are composed of minerals.</p>
<h2 id=which-would-most-likely-occur-during-the-formation-of-igneous-rocks>Which would most likely occur during the formation of igneous rocks?</h2>
<p>In essence, igneous rocks are formed through the cooling and solidification of magma ( or lava). As hot, molten rock rises to the surface, it undergoes changes in temperature and pressure that cause it to cool, solidify, and crystallize.</p>
<h2 id=what-ancient-environment-is-the-most-likely-inferred>What ancient environment is the most likely inferred?</h2>
<p>Answer: Evaporation of sea water.</p>
<h2 id=which-mineral-has-a-hardness-of-6-and-shows-cleavage>Which mineral has a hardness of 6 and shows cleavage?</h2>

<h2 id=which-is-the-most-abundant-rock-found-on-the-earth>Which is the most abundant rock found on the earth?</h2>
<p>Igneous rocks are the most abundant in the Earth’s crust; particularly granite and basalt.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-similarities-of-igneous-sedimentary-and-metamorphic-rock>What is the similarities of igneous sedimentary and metamorphic rock?</h2>
<p>Among these, igneous and metamorphic rocks share the following similarities: Both of them are types of rocks. Temperature is a key factor in the formation of both types of rocks. Igneous rocks are formed from the cooling of magma, which is formed as a result of high temperatures causing rocks to melt.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-syracuse-new-york-get-its-salt-from>Where did Syracuse New York get its salt from?</h2>
<p>Brine from springs in and around the southern end of Onondaga Lake, from former brine wells dug or drilled at the lakes’ edge, and from wells that tapped halite (common salt) beds near Tully, N.Y., 15 miles south of Syracuse, were used commercially from the late 1700’s through the early 1900’s for salt production.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-salt-mines-in-new-york>Where are the salt mines in New York?</h2>
<p>The Solvay Process Company drilled several deep test holes in the area south of Syracuse and eventually encountered halite deposits at a depth of 1,216 feet below land surface in the southern end of Tully Valley (fig. 3), about 15 miles south of Syracuse.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-bedrock-found-in-new-york-state>Where is bedrock found in New York State?</h2>
<p>According to the generalized bedrock geology of New York State in the earth science reference tables, what is the geologic age of the bedrock found at the surface at 43 degrees 30 north latitude by 75 degrees west longitude? Which area in New York State is located on rock formations that contain large amounts of deposits?</p>
<h2 id=how-did-salt-production-increase-in-the-1800s>How did salt production increase in the 1800’s?</h2>
<p>The increasing production of salt by evaporation “solar salt”‘ (fig. 2) in the early 1800’s required brine of a higher concentration than was available from the springs; therefore, shallow dug wells were constructed in an attempt to find a more concentrated brine.</p>
