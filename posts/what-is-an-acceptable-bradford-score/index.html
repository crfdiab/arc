<h2 id=what-is-an-acceptable-bradford-score>What is an acceptable Bradford score?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseEssentially, the higher the score, the worse an employee’s attendance record. In some cases, a Bradford Factor score higher than 500 could be used as justification for dismissal. Scores between 200 and 500 indicate serious absenteeism concerns and may require addressing the issue.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-nhs-use-the-bradford-factor>Does the NHS use the Bradford Factor?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseHow do I use the Bradford Factor? Originally developed at the Bradford University School of Management in the early 1980s, the Bradford Factor is used by numerous companies across the globe including Government organisations (UK Prison Service for example).</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-bradford-points-last>How long do Bradford points last?</h2>
<p>52 weeks<br>
Hear this out loudPauseBradford factor scores are based on the frequency and length of an employee’s absence during a defined period, usually 52 weeks. Some HR systems, like CIPHR, can automatically calculate this score for you. Free online calculators are also available.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-included-in-bradford-factor>What is included in Bradford Factor?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseWhat is the Bradford Factor? The Bradford Factor is a formula commonly used in HR to measure employee absence. It’s a number that represents how many un-planned absences an employee has taken during the last working year. Generally, the rule is that the number increases with each bout of absence.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-sack-someone-who-is-off-sick>Can you sack someone who is off sick?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseIllness. If you are persistently off sick, or on long-term sick, your employer should normally look at any alternatives before deciding to dismiss you. For example, they might have to consider whether the job itself is making you sick and needs to be changed. You can still be dismissed if you are off sick.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-sickness-days-is-acceptable>How many sickness days is acceptable?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseThere are no laws or regulations regarding the number of sick days an employee can take. However, if they are absent for more than 7 days, they will have to provide proof of sickness. Thanks for sharing!</p>
<h2 id=what-is-classed-as-long-term-sick-nhs>What is classed as long term sick NHS?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseLong-term sickness absence is defined as a continuous period of absence lasting more than 28 days. The employee must give you a ‘fit note’ (formerly a ‘sick note’) if they’re absent for more than seven days. Hospital doctors or GPs provide these, but may charge a fee if a fit note is requested before seven days.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-nhs-sick-pay>How much is NHS sick pay?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseYou can get £96.35 per week Statutory Sick Pay ( SSP ) if you’re too ill to work. It’s paid by your employer for up to 28 weeks. This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg). You must be eligible for SSP .</p>
<h2 id=can-i-be-sacked-for-being-off-sick-uk>Can I be sacked for being off sick UK?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseIllness. You can be dismissed if you have a persistent or long-term illness that makes it impossible for you to do your job. Before taking any action, your employer should: give you reasonable time to recover from your illness.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-lower-my-bradford-factor>How do I lower my Bradford Factor?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseStudies have shown that by educating employees about the Bradford Factor, and informing them of their score on a regular basis, absenteeism can be dramatically reduced. This is largely down to employees realizing that taking the odd day off here and there will quickly multiply their Bradford Factor score.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-bradford-factor-does-not-work>Why the Bradford Factor does not work?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseThe score takes away employer subjectivity. No one can accuse you of taking action against them or someone else because you dislike them. And you can’t just ignore the evidence when someone you like has a high score. However, one Bradford Factor disadvantage is that of indirect discrimination.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-a-bradford-score-calculated>How is a Bradford score calculated?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseThe Bradford score is calculated with the formula [B = S x S x D]. Generally, the set period of time is a financial year or 52 week period. HR teams can ascertain the absence impact with this formula.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-bradford-factor-legal-in-the-uk>Is the Bradford Factor legal in the UK?</h2>
<p>Is the Bradford Factor legal? In short, yes. You can take action against repeated instances of unauthorised absence. But you need to set fair trigger points, such as the scores above. It’s not a crime to be ill, after all. If you hand out a final written warning after someone takes one day off, you’re being too harsh.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-bradford-factor-used-in-business>How is the Bradford factor used in business?</h2>
<p>Q: What is the Bradford Factor? The Bradford Factor is a method of determining the impact of staff absenteeism based on the theory that frequent bouts of short, unplanned absence have drastically more impact on a business than longer absences. Q: Why is it called the Bradford Factor?</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a-lower-bradford-factor-score-mean>What does a lower Bradford Factor score mean?</h2>
<p>With the Bradford Factor, the lower the score the better. Higher scores indicate a more disruptive pattern of absence for the business. The Bradford Factor can help to flag up possible issues surrounding an individual’s absence.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-bradford-factor-used-in-absence-management>How is the Bradford factor used in absence management?</h2>
<p>In partnership with the Trade Unions, the revised Absence Management Policy seeks to adopt a new methodology for absence monitoring: The Bradford Factor. This method takes into account the occurrences of sickness absence and the duration of the absence to ensure a fair and consistent approach is adopted across the organisation.</p>
