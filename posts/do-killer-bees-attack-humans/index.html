<h2 id=do-killer-bees-attack-humans>Do killer bees attack humans?</h2>
<p>While honey bees sting to educate and defend, killer bees mobilize as an entire colony if their hive is attacked. Due to their sheer numbers, Africanized honey bees can kill large mammals and even humans — especially children and the elderly, who have a more difficult time escaping.</p>
<h2 id=which-state-has-the-most-killer-bees>Which state has the most killer bees?</h2>
<p>Africanized honey bees can be found in most of mid and southern Texas, about one-third of New Mexico, all over Arizona, the southern half of New Mexico, and the southern third of California. Killer bees continue to migrate northward and have reached most of the southern U.S. up to the Chesapeake Bay area.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-will-killer-bees-follow-you>How far will killer bees follow you?</h2>
<p>A bee can obtain speeds of from 12 to 15 miles per hour, but most healthy humans can outrun them. So, RUN! And when you run Keep Running ! Africanized honey bees have been known to follow people for more than a quarter mile.</p>
<h2 id=is-killer-bee-honey-dangerous>Is Killer Bee honey dangerous?</h2>
<p>The nectar-produced honey of the Africanized bees has some of the stings they create, so it is harmful to eat. While their honeycombs tempt you with a gold mine of nectar, it is better to get the store-bought version to avoid any harm.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-tell-the-difference-between-a-honey-bee-and-a-killer-bee>How do you tell the difference between a honey bee and a killer bee?</h2>
<p>Africanized “killer” bees look so much like domestic honey bees that the only way to tell the two apart is by measuring their bodies. Africanized bees are slightly smaller than their counterpart. They are golden yellow with darker bands of brown.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-killer-bees-does-it-take-to-kill-a-human>How many killer bees does it take to kill a human?</h2>
<p>According to the Merck Manual, a human can sustain 10 bee stings for each pound of body weight. Therefore, the average adult should be able to survive around 1,000 bee stings, while a child could survive 500.</p>
<h2 id=what-us-states-have-killer-bees>What US states have killer bees?</h2>
<p>Killer bees are found mainly in southern California, southern Nevada, Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, western Louisiana, southern Arkansas, and central and southern Florida.</p>
<h2 id=do-bees-actually-chase-you>Do bees actually chase you?</h2>
<p>It’s not that bees are mean, in a human sense. But they do take exception to any people or animals that threaten their nest, or colony. Some bees may pursue victims a half mile or more before giving up the chase. Don’t be fooled into seeking escape in water.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-will-a-honey-bee-chase-you>How far will a honey bee chase you?</h2>
<p>Normal bees that have you ‘marked for stinging’ will chase you no more than 100 feet from their hive. African honeybees have no limit to how far they will sting you. They sting until you drop.</p>
<h2 id=is-killer-bee-honey-better-than-normal-honey>Is Killer Bee honey better than normal honey?</h2>
<p>Killer bees or Africanized honey bees are actually great honey producers. The sting of the killer isn’t any more threatening than the European honey bee we all know and love. In fact killer bees are smaller than European bees, so they carry less venom. However they are more aggressive than regular honey bees.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-killer-bees-in-florida>What do you call Killer Bees in Florida?</h2>
<p>Because AHBs are established in Florida, it is important to become familiar with AHBs and their behavior. Although they are often referred to as killer bees, the correct term is Africanized honey bees.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-wild-honey-bees-in-florida>Are there any wild honey bees in Florida?</h2>
<p>It is not uncommon in Florida for honey bees to be present in the environment, not managed by a beekeeper. Wild or, more appropriately, feral honey bees have the potential to be a nuisance when found on private or commercial property, either in a swarm state or fully developed as an established colony.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-africanized-honey-bee-a-killer-bee>Is the Africanized honey bee a Killer Bee?</h2>
<p>Africanized honey bees can be frightening. You should respect them, but remember that their “killer bee” image comes from rumors and sci-fi movies, not from facts. Although AHB populations are generally more defensive than are EHB ones, EHBs also display defensive behavior, though at a much reduced level.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-florida-beekeeper-remove-a-bee-colony>Can a Florida beekeeper remove a bee colony?</h2>
<p>In some cases, depending on the size, location and temperament of an established colony, a registered Florida beekeeper can remove an established colony and all of its components (bees, comb, brood, honey) and relocate it safely to an apiary.</p>
