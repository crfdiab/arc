<h2 id=what-is-mt-unzen-famous-for>What is Mt Unzen famous for?</h2>
<p>Mount Unzen is perhaps most famous for its destructive and fatal eruption on June 3, 1991 at 4:08 pm. This eruption caused the first large-scale pyroclastic flow, unprecedented at the time, which killed 43 people in the evacuation zone.</p>
<h2 id=is-mount-unzen-a-convergent-boundary>Is Mount Unzen a convergent boundary?</h2>
<p>The Unzen volcano complex makes up most of the Shimabara Peninsula east of Nagasaki. Two oceanic plates that are on either side of the convergent boundary causes subduction to occur. As the result of one plate subducting under the other it causes a trench to form. Once this happens, deep, shallow earthquakes occur.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-mount-unzen-become-a-national-park>How did Mount Unzen become a National Park?</h2>
<p>Unzen originally read “onsen” in the notation of hot spring, but it was changed to the current notation when it was designated as a national park. An army radar base was built near the summit of Fugen-dake during the Pacific War, where about 100 people were stationed. This section needs additional citations for verification.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-choose-to-live-near-volcanoes>Why do people choose to live near volcanoes?</h2>
<p>Yet, throughout history, people have deliberately chosen to risk all those hazards and live near them, even on the slopes of active volcanoes that have erupted within living memory. They chose to live close to volcanoes because they felt that the advantages outweighed the disadvantages.</p>

<h2 id=is-it-safe-for-people-to-live-near-a-volcano>Is it safe for people to live near a volcano?</h2>
<p>Most volcanoes are perfectly safe for long periods in between eruptions, and those that do erupt more frequently are usually thought of, by the people who live there, as being predictable. Today, about 500 million people live on or close to volcanoes.</p>
