<h2 id=why-does-tom-hit-myrtle-in-the-great-gatsby>Why does Tom hit Myrtle in The Great Gatsby?</h2>
<p>Tom hits Myrtle because she refused to obey him, but also in defense of Daisy; he feels strongly about both women. Tom’s outburst therefore shows that he has difficulty handling complex emotions. He responds with violence to maintain control.</p>

<p>She thinks she married beneath her and that Tom is the ticket to wealth and status. In her apartment in New York City, she pretends that she and Tom are in the same social class. When Myrtle repeats Daisy’s name, Tom breaks her nose. He has almost no respect for Myrtle, and only slightly more for his wife.</p>

<p>Wilson’s business is not thriving, and he has no clue that his wife is carrying on with anyone else–especially not the rich Tom Buchanan. Myrtle is not a woman of class, elegance or style when we meet her in her own environment, and that does not change when when we see her in her fancy apartment in New York City.</p>

<p>It is purely for show, a place where Myrtle can feel like a part of the New York set, a part of Tom Buchanan’s world. As such, the apartment reflects the sense of fashion, luxury, and materialism that Myrtle is so desperate to attain and, more importantly, to showcase to others.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-myrtles-apartment-so-small-in-the-great-gatsby>Why is Myrtle’s apartment so small in the Great Gatsby?</h2>
<p>In reality however, as emphasized by the small size of the apartment, this belief of Myrtle’s is a delusion. The small size of the apartment emphasizes that she will never belong to the social elite, and it also emphasizes Tom’s relative indifference to her.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-tom-want-to-keep-daisy-and-myrtle-separate>Why did Tom want to keep Daisy and Myrtle separate?</h2>

He also had Myrtle, whose lust for life fed his ego and whose sexual attraction was undeniable.</p>
