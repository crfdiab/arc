<h2 id=is-new-zealand-a-hotspot>Is New Zealand a hotspot?</h2>
<p>The New Zealand archipelago is another hotspot. Life on New Zealand evolved in isolation, so the islands contain many species not found anywhere else. More than 90 percent of the insects and 80 percent of the vascular plants in New Zealand are endemic to the region.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-threats-to-new-zealand>What are some threats to New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Today, invasive alien species remain an important threat to New Zealand’s biodiversity, but large-scale habitat destruction, through deforestation, wetland drainage and ecosystem degradation, represents as serious an issue.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-biodiversity-hotspot>What makes a biodiversity hotspot?</h2>
<p>To qualify as a biodiversity hotspot, a region must meet two strict criteria: It must have at least 1,500 vascular plants as endemics — which is to say, it must have a high percentage of plant life found nowhere else on the planet. A hotspot, in other words, is irreplaceable. In other words, it must be threatened.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-islands-biodiversity-hotspots>Why are islands biodiversity hotspots?</h2>
<p>Islands are often considered biodiversity hotspots due to the variety of species that have evolved to thrive on these remote pieces of land. The features of island living have led to a high number of endemic species, meaning these species are found nowhere else in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-pests-in-nz>What are the main pests in NZ?</h2>
<p>Northland’s biggest pests</p>
<ul>
<li>Possums. There are estimated to be up to 15 million possums in Northland and they eat tonnes of leaves, twigs and berries every night.</li>
<li>Mustelids. Mustelids are weasels, stoats and ferrets.</li>
<li>Feral Cats.</li>
<li>Goats.</li>
<li>Wasps.</li>
<li>Deer.</li>
<li>Mynas.</li>
<li>Rabbits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-do-i-make-nz-predators-free>How do I make NZ predators free?</h2>
<p>Three ways to help make NZ Predator Free from your home</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect with your local Predator Free group.</li>
<li>Tracking and chew cards.</li>
<li>Trapping.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-are-hotspot-areas>What are hotspot areas?</h2>
<p>A coronavirus hotspot is an area in a district where six or more people have been tested positive of coronavirus infection. The area is earmarked based on probability of high degree of spread and people’s response to the call for home stay.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-biological-hotspots-are-there-in-india>How many biological hotspots are there in India?</h2>
<p>36 Biodiversity Hotspots<br>
Officially, four out of the 36 Biodiversity Hotspots in the world are present in India: the Himalayas, the Western Ghats, the Indo-Burma region and the Sundaland.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-new-zealand-considered-a-biodiversity-hotspot>Why is New Zealand considered a biodiversity hotspot?</h2>
<p>New Zealand is an internationally recognised world ‘hotspot’ for biodiversity. This high endemism is largely the result of our long isolation from other land masses and diverse geography and climate, allowing unique flora and fauna to develop.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-new-zealand-a-hotspot-for-earthquakes>How is New Zealand a hotspot for earthquakes?</h2>
<p>It is a tectonically active hotspot with frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity. New Zealand’s forests have been greatly depleted, but, of the remaining forests, the most impressive are those of giant New Zealand kauri ( Agathis australis ), which are restricted to the far north.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-diverse-hotspot-in-the-world>Which is the most diverse hotspot in the world?</h2>
<p>There are over 30 recognized biodiversity hotspots in the world. The Andes Mountains Tropical Hotspot is the world’s most diverse hotspot. About one-sixth of all plant species in the world live in this region. The New Zealand archipelago is another hotspot.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-environment-does-new-zealand-have>What kind of environment does New Zealand have?</h2>
<p>Like the nearby New Caledonia Biodiversity Hotspot, New Zealand is an “ancient life-raft.” Largely isolated for millions of years, the islands have evolved unique flora and fauna. New Zealand ranges in latitude from subtropical to subantarctic and is a land of varied landscapes, with rugged mountains, rolling hills and wide plains.</p>
