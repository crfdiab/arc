<p>Also, by its very nature, mountainous uplands are not preserved — they are completely eroded away.</p>
<h2 id=how-erosion-forms-mountains>How erosion forms mountains?</h2>
<p>The tectonic forces that lead to mountain building are continuously countered by erosion due to intensified precipitation, wind and temperature extremes. These combined forces break up the rocks and erode the peaks into their stark, sculpted forms. Falling ice, rocks and gushing water wear away at the mountain slopes.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-mountain-erosion>What is mountain erosion?</h2>
<p>Erosion includes the disaggregation of bedrock, the stripping away of sediment from slopes and the transport of the sediment by rivers. For example, mountains lift the winds that flow over them, causing increased precipitation on the range’s windward slopes, intensifying erosion as a result.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-uplift-and-erosion>What is uplift and erosion?</h2>
<p>Under these conditions, gravity acts by erosion, redistributing mass from higher altitudes to lower elevations in search of equilibrium defined by the base level. After the building of mountains by tectonics and volcanism, chemical weathering and physical breakup shape the earth surface.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-uplift-increase-erosion>How does uplift increase erosion?</h2>
<p>Isostatic uplift is both a cause and an effect of erosion. When deformation occurs in the form of crustal thickening an isostatic response is induced causing the thickened crust to sink, and surrounding thinner crust to uplift. The resulting surface uplift leads to enhanced elevations, which in turn induces erosion.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-erosion-related-to-the-uplift-of-a-mountain>How is erosion related to the uplift of a mountain?</h2>
<p>Mountain Erosion. These combined forces break up the rocks and erode the peaks into their stark, sculpted forms. Falling ice, rocks and gushing water wear away at the mountain slopes. The ice and rock debris accumulates in the valleys and flows downwards as slow moving glaciers. When these melt, piles of rock debris called moraines are left behind.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-rock-to-fall-off-a-mountain>What causes rock to fall off a mountain?</h2>
<p>Strong winds pick up dust and abrade exposed rock surfaces. Lightning instantly vaporizes water and ice in rock fissures and literally blows rocks apart. Temperature changes thaw out and refreeze the ice in rock fissures, wedging them apart, whilst thermal expansion and contraction disintegrates exposed rock surfaces.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-erosion-processes>What are the different types of erosion processes?</h2>

<h2 id=how-does-erosion-take-place-in-a-river>How does erosion take place in a river?</h2>
<p>Erosion is the process that wears away the river bed and banks. Erosion also breaks up the rocks that are carried by the river. Hydraulic action – This is the sheer power of the water as it smashes against the river banks. Air becomes trapped in the cracks of the river bank and bed, and causes the rock to break apart.</p>
