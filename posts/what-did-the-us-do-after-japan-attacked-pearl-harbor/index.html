<h2 id=what-did-the-us-do-after-japan-attacked-pearl-harbor>What did the US do after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor?</h2>
<p>Continuing to intensify its military mobilization, the U.S. government finished converting to a war economy, a process begun by provision of weapons and supplies to the Soviet Union and the British Empire. Japanese Americans from the West Coast were sent to internment camps for the duration of the war.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-us-do-following-pearl-harbor>What did the US do following Pearl Harbor?</h2>
<p>Less than five months after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Army Air Force launched B-25 bombers from the deck of the USS Hornet (something that was supposed to be impossible) and bombed Tokyo. The raid was more a psychological victory than a tactical one, but psychology is important in winning a war.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-united-states-recover-from-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor>Did the United States recover from the attack on Pearl Harbor?</h2>
<p>In addition to ship cleaning, salvage and repair, their work included recovering human remains, documents and ammunition. But thanks to the heroic salvage effort, the great majority of the U.S. battleships and other vessels attacked at Pearl Harbor would survive to take on the Axis in World War II.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-pearl-harbor-affect-american-citizens>How did Pearl Harbor affect American citizens?</h2>
<p>Impact of the Pearl Harbor Attack In all, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor crippled or destroyed nearly 20 American ships and more than 300 airplanes. Dry docks and airfields were likewise destroyed. Most important, 2,403 sailors, soldiers and civilians were killed and about 1,000 people were wounded.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-respond-to-the-japanese-attack-on-pearl-harbor>How did the US respond to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor?</h2>
<p>In response to the Japanese aggression, the U.S. Congress placed restrictions on business with Japan and Japanese assets in the United States were frozen. In 1939, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ordered the US Pacific Fleet to move from California to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-died-in-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor>How many people died in the attack on Pearl Harbor?</h2>
<p>After two continuous hours of bombing, more than 2400 American people died, and 21 navy ships got highly damaged. After the betrayal incident, the US ended up all diplomatic negotiations with the Japanese Empire. The next day, on 8th December 1941, US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared war on Japan and formally entered World War 2.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-us-ships-still-in-pearl-harbor>Are there any US ships still in Pearl Harbor?</h2>
<p>Of the 22 Japanese ships that took part in the attack, only one survived the war. As of 2006, the only U.S. ships in Pearl Harbor during the attack still remaining afloat are the Coast Guard Cutter Taney and the yard tug Hoga.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-public-opinion-before-pearl-harbor>What was the public opinion before Pearl Harbor?</h2>
<p>Before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor Island, the USA’s citizens were diversified into various groups with various opinions. They had different viewpoints over the war. In public opinion polls, some percentages of people were in support of America to enter World War 2 and help its allied power nations like Great Britain and France.</p>
