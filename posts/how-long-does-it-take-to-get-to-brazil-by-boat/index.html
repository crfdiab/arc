<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-brazil-by-boat>How long does it take to get to Brazil by boat?</h2>
<p>At 14 knots which is pretty reasonable for a tanker or a bulker that’s about 16 days. Add a day waiting to transit the canal and you are up to 17 days.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-take-a-ship-to-brazil>Can I take a ship to Brazil?</h2>
<p>Depending on the delivery area, average transit times for shipping from the U.S. to Brazil range from 3-4 days for express service. DHL, FedEx and USPS are shipping carriers you can choose to transport your items. When shipping from the U.S. to Brazil, you are unable to import shipments without paying a duty or tax.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-shipping-take-from-brazil-to-usa>How long does shipping take from Brazil to USA?</h2>
<p>The air-cargo transit time between Brazil and the US is usually around ten days. The transit times for ocean freight will vary depending on your destination. If you are planning to ship to the south or east coast of the USA, then your transit time will be relatively short.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-sail-from-africa-to-brazil>How long does it take to sail from Africa to Brazil?</h2>
<p>The crossing took us 20 days.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-would-it-take-to-walk-from-florida-to-brazil>How long would it take to walk from Florida to Brazil?</h2>
<p>Florida is located around 3772 KM away from Brazil so if you travel at the consistent speed of 50 KM per hour you can reach Brazil in 75.45 hours.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-sail-from-spain-to-the-caribbean>How long does it take to sail from Spain to the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>The easiest way on crossing the Atlantic with a square rigger is to follow the tradewinds, and it takes some two months to sail from Spain to Caribbean (one month to Canarias and one month across the ocean by following the northeasternly tradewind). It takes 2 to 3 weeks for a modern yacht to sail from Canarias to Caribbean.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-a-cargo-ship-to-cross-the-atlantic>How long does it take a cargo ship to cross the Atlantic?</h2>
<p>It usually takes around 10-20 days to cross the Atlantic Ocean on a cargo ship. The length of the journey depends on the route and the speed of the container ship. Here are a few examples of popular (or otherwise interesting) Transatlantic cargo ship routes and their approximate durations: Le Havre (France) – New York (USA) = 9 days.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-ship-from-air-to-sea>How long does it take to ship from air to sea?</h2>
<p>In very rough estimates: express can take as little as 1-3 days, air freight is typically 5-10 days, and sea shipping can range anywhere from 20-45 days. Of course, Why is there such a wide range in shipment duration when shipping by sea? Because there are a lot of ways to ship. Seriously.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-calculate-the-distance-of-a-sailboat>How to calculate the distance of a sailboat?</h2>
<p>The answers are right here! How does it work? Click on the map to set your start point. Click your route to navigate around the map – it will add up the distance as you go. If you want to go back a step, or start again, just click the buttons below the map.</p>
