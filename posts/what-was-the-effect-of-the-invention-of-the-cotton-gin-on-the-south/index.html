<h2 id=what-was-the-effect-of-the-invention-of-the-cotton-gin-on-the-south>What was the effect of the invention of the cotton gin on the South?</h2>
<p>The invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney in 1793 had a profound effect on the institution of slavery in the Southern states. By making it easier to pick the seeds from the cotton, the cotton gin made cotton a profitable cash crop for South Carolina planters.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-cotton-so-important-in-the-south>Why was cotton so important in the south?</h2>
<p>Cotton transformed the United States, making fertile land in the Deep South, from Georgia to Texas, extraordinarily valuable. Growing more cotton meant an increased demand for slaves. Slaves in the Upper South became incredibly more valuable as commodities because of this demand for them in the Deep South.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-cotton-change-the-economy-of-the-south>How did cotton change the economy of the South?</h2>
<p>The economy of the south became depended on cotton. In the north the availability of large amounts of now relatively cheap cotton made textile mills a possibility in the north. The cotton gin changed the economy of the south to a mainly agriculture economy based on cotton and slavery.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-cotton-gin-affect-the-slave-states>How did the cotton gin affect the slave states?</h2>
<p>The cotton gin changed the way cotton was processed and greatly affected the slave states. In the south, the cotton gin had positive and negative effects on the production of cotton.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-cotton-gin-do-and-who-invented-it>What did the cotton gin do and who invented it?</h2>
<p>The cotton gin is a machine designed to remove cotton from its seeds. The process uses a small screen and pulling hooks to force the cotton through the screen. It was invented by Eli Whitney on March 14, 1794, one of the many inventions that was created during the American Industrial Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-cotton-gin-important-to-the-antebellum-period>Why was the cotton gin important to the antebellum period?</h2>
<p>1) To introduce students to the processes of creating and protecting intellectual property. 2) To demonstrate how the cotton gin, and expanding cotton production, fostered regional interdependence and Northern industrial growth during the antebellum period.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-pounds-of-cotton-could-whitneys-cotton-gin-produce>How many pounds of cotton could Whitney’s cotton gin produce?</h2>
<p>A single slave cranking a small ‘gin could clean ten pounds of cotton in a day. A slave using just his hand to clean cotton was lucky to clear a pound a day. Once steam powered ‘gins were developed, the capacity for producing cotton was only limited by the amount of cotton a farmer could produce.</p>
