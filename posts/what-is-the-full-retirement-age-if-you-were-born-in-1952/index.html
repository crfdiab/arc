<p>age 66<br>
This worksheet shows how to estimate the Social Security monthly retirement benefit you would be eligible for at age 62 if you were born in 1952. It also allows you to estimate what you would receive at age 66, your full retirement age, excluding any cost-of-living adjustments for which you may be eligible.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-retirement-age-in-the-republic-of-ireland>What is the retirement age in the Republic of Ireland?</h2>
<p>67<br>
The Irish government has confirmed that the state pension age will not increase to 67 in January 2021. In a statement as part of the Irish Budget 2021, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Michael McGrath, a TD in Fianna Fáil, confirmed the change from the previous government’s plans.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-pension-age-change-to-66-ireland>When did pension age change to 66 Ireland?</h2>
<p>The change affects those born on or after January 1st 1948 . More increases in the qualifying age for the State pension are due to come into effect over the coming years. It will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-state-pension-age-change-ireland>When did State pension age change Ireland?</h2>
<p>These changes are: The State Pension (Transition) which is paid to people aged 65 who have retired from work will be abolished from 1 January 2014. Employees who retire at age 65 will no longer receive this transition pension and will have to wait until age 66 to receive the State Pension (Contributory).</p>
<h2 id=can-i-retire-at-55-in-ireland>Can I retire at 55 in Ireland?</h2>
<p>There is no single retirement age as such in Ireland, although 65 is generally regarded as the age most people retire at. Many employment contracts, however, allow for early retirement from 60 (or in some cases, from 55). Most also allow for early retirement on health grounds.</p>
<h2 id=what-benefits-do-pensioners-get-in-ireland>What benefits do pensioners get in Ireland?</h2>
<p>There are a number of welfare payments available to retired and older people living in Ireland….Household Benefits Package</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Electricity Allowance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Natural Gas Allowance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Electricity (Group Account) Allowance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bottled Gas Refill Allowance.</p>

<li>
<p>The Telephone Allowance.</p>

<h2 id=the-free-television-licence-how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-get-a-state-pension-in-ireland>The Free Television Licence. How old do you have to be to get a state pension in Ireland?</h2>
<p>But how old do you need to be in order to qualify for the Irish State pension? If relying on the State pension, a person must be 66 years of age in order to qualify. However, the age of retirement is set to increase over the next few decades. By 2021 the retirement age will be 67 and by 2028 it will be 68 years of age.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-age-of-retirement-in-ireland>What’s the average age of retirement in Ireland?</h2>
<p>However, the age of retirement is set to increase over the next few decades. By 2021 the retirement age will be 67 and by 2028 it will be 68 years of age.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-state-pension-age-change-to-65-in-the-uk>When did the state pension age change to 65 in the UK?</h2>
<p>Before any future changes could become law Parliament would need to approve the plans. GOV.UK provides more information about claiming the State Pension and how to get a State Pension statement. Under the Pensions Act 2011, women’s State Pension age will increase more quickly to 65 between April 2016 and November 2018.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-ireland-not-raise-the-pension-age>Why did Ireland not raise the pension age?</h2>
<p>Pushing the pension age up to 67 would have brought Ireland into an elite group – and, like lockdown perhaps, not one we would necessarily want to be part of.</p>
