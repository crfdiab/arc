<h2 id=how-did-the-moon-affect-the-earth>How did the moon affect the Earth?</h2>
<p>The moon’s gravity pulls at the Earth, causing predictable rises and falls in sea levels known as tides. Low tides occur between these two humps. The pull of the moon is also slowing the Earth’s rotation, an effect known as tidal braking, which increases the length of our day by 2.3 milliseconds per century.</p>
<h2 id=does-moon-affect-humans>Does Moon affect humans?</h2>
<p>So, does the Moon really affect our health and mood? There is no absolute proof that the Moon affects human mental and physical health, though its effect has been observed in other organisms: corals for instance appear to time their spawning based on the lunar cycle.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-you-weight-less-in-the-morning>Why do you weight less in the morning?</h2>
<p>In the morning our stomach is empty and the body’s water is lost through sweat, respiration and urination. Due to these factors, we feel lighter.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-be-the-effect-on-earth-if-the-moon-was-destroyed>What would be the effect on Earth if the Moon was destroyed?</h2>
<p>What would be the effect on earth if the moon was destroyed? – Quora Something went wrong. Wait a moment and try again.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-there-is-no-moon-or-sun>What happens if there is no moon or Sun?</h2>
<p>But, if there were no Moon, every day would be 24 hours no matter what until eventually, the Sun burns all its fuel. Debris would come crashing into Earth. If the Moon were destroyed, we would certainly feel the impact.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-tilt-of-the-moon-change-over-time>How does the tilt of the Moon change over time?</h2>
<p>You might not think the Moon has much to do with that, but over tens of thousands of years, that tilt changes: from as little as 22.1° to as much as 24.5°. The Moon is a stabilizing force, as worlds without big moons — like Mars — see their axial tilt change by ten times as much over time.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-moon-affect-the-level-of-the-seas>How does the moon affect the level of the seas?</h2>
<p>Together with the Sun, the Moon is responsible for increasing and decreasing the level of our seas several times a day. As the Moon revolves around the Earth, the former’s gravity pulls the oceans toward it and thus high tides are created.</p>
