<h2 id=who-named-archipelago-of-st-lazarus>Who named archipelago of St Lazarus?</h2>
<p>It was only later in the 16th century that the voyages of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan (1480-1521) first brought Catholicism to the archipelago, originally named St. Lazarus’ Islands by Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos (1500?</p>
<h2 id=who-proposed-the-name-maharlika-to-be-the-name-of-the-country>Who proposed the name Maharlika to be the name of the country?</h2>
<p>Senator Eddie Ilarde was the first to propose to rename the Philippines into “Maharlika” in 1978, citing the need to honor the country’s ancient heritage before the Spanish and Americans occupied the country.</p>
<h2 id=who-named-pilipinas>Who named Pilipinas?</h2>
<p>The Philippines was named after Prince Philip (later King Philip II) of Spain, by the Spanish explorer Ruy Lopez de Villalobos during his 1542-1546 expedition to the islands.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-chinese-traders-call-the-archipelago>How did the Chinese traders call the archipelago?</h2>
<p>As early as 1144 A.D., the Chinese already had names for the entire archipelago—Mayi—and certain islands like Pai-P’u-yen for the Babuyan Islands, Liu-hsin for Luzon and Pa-lao-yu for Palawan.</p>
<h2 id=is-maharlika-a-hebrew-word>Is Maharlika a Hebrew word?</h2>
<p>So what does Maharlika mean for both Tagalog and Hebrew? In Hebrew: “A dowry sent to yourself.”</p>
<h2 id=what-do-chinese-call-the-philippines>What do Chinese call the Philippines?</h2>
<p>In 1992, a new term, Tsinoy, was coined, which has gained popularity and common usage. The term “Tsinoy” is colloquial for Tsinong Pinoy, or Chinese Filipino. The Philippines is situated on the eastern edge of Asia, bounded to the west by the South China Sea and to the east by the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-philippines-get-its-name-filipinas>How did the Philippines get its name Filipinas?</h2>
<p>Montero y Vidal says that the island first to receive the name Filipinas was Leyte, and that this name was given in July or August of the year 1543 to include some of the smaller islands in the group. Urdaneta used Las Islas Filipinas as we do now, standing for the whole Philippine group. Ophir- Oldname – Land that supplies King Solomon with Golds.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-philippines-get-its-name-ma-i>How did the Philippines get its name Ma-i?</h2>
<p>In so far as recorded history is concerned, Ma-i seems to be the earliest name under which the Philippines was known tothe Chinese traders, who were coming here in the tenth century A.D., attracted by such articles of commerce as yellowwax, cotton, pearls, tortoise shell, betel nuts, abaca, and so forth.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-original-name-of-mindoro-philippines>What was the original name of Mindoro Philippines?</h2>
<p>This was further proved by Ferdinand Blumentritt in his 1882 book, Versuch einer Ethnographie der Philippinen (An Attempt to the Study of Ethnography of the Philippines) that Ma-i, which means “country of the Blacks” was the Chinese local name of present-day Mindoro.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-island-of-mindanao-get-its-name>How did the island of Mindanao get its name?</h2>
<p>Caesarea Caroli was the name given by Villalobos to the island of Mindanao when he reached the sea near it. This was named after the Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire (and I of Spain).</p>
