<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-tibet-genocide>Who was involved in the Tibet genocide?</h2>
<p>The Communist Chinese invasion in 1950 led to years of turmoil, that culminated in the complete overthrow of the Tibetan Government and the self-imposed exile of the Dalai Lama and 100,000 Tibetans in 1959. Since that time over a million Tibetans have been killed.</p>
<h2 id=does-china-still-control-tibet>Does China still control Tibet?</h2>
<p>Tibet, the remote and mainly-Buddhist territory known as the “roof of the world”, is governed as an autonomous region of China. Beijing claims a centuries-old sovereignty over the Himalayan region. In 1959, after a failed anti-Chinese uprising, the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet and set up a government in exile in India.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-threatening-the-tibetan-way-of-life>What is threatening the Tibetan way of life?</h2>
<p>The greatest threat to the survival of Tibetan culture came with the Chinese “liberation” in 1950 and the flight of the Dalai Lama to India in 1959. It admitted that the economic condition of the Tibetans was worse than in 1950 when the Chinese intervened.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-tibet-is-han-chinese>What percentage of Tibet is Han Chinese?</h2>
<p>8.17 per cent<br>
According to the official 2010 Census, Tibetans comprise roughly 90.5 per cent of the population of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), or around 3 million Tibetans, with Han Chinese making up 8.17 per cent – a figure that however does not include many Han migrants, military forces and their families resident for …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-illegal-in-tibet>What is illegal in Tibet?</h2>
<p>Reported abuses of human rights in Tibet include restricted freedom of religion, belief, and association; arbitrary arrest; maltreatment in custody, including torture; and forced abortion and sterilization.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-organisations-that-support-the-tibetan-independence-movement>Are there any organisations that support the Tibetan independence movement?</h2>
<p>Organisations which support the Tibetan independence movement include: Tibetan Youth Congress – Located at Dharamsala, the seat of the Government of Tibet in Exile in India, claims 30,000 members. International Tibet Independence Movement – Located in Indiana, United States.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-united-states-concerned-about-tibet>Why was the United States concerned about Tibet?</h2>
<p>Particularly, the United States feared communist involvement in the region. A 1957 report on logistical issues indicated increasing trepidation that the Chinese would escalate their communist presence in Tibet. The spread of communism in the international community was a huge concern for the United States.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-tibetans-train-in-the-us>Where did the Tibetans train in the US?</h2>
<p>They were trained for 5 months on combat maneuvers. These teams selected and then trained Tibetan soldiers in the Rocky Mountains of the United States; as well as at Camp Hale in Colorado.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cias-role-in-the-tibet-issue>What was the CIA’s role in the Tibet issue?</h2>
<p>The CIA Tibetan program was a nearly two decades long anti-Chinese covert operation focused on Tibet which consisted of “political action, propaganda, paramilitary and intelligence operations” based on U.S. Government arrangements made with brothers of the 14th Dalai Lama, who was not initially aware of them.</p>
