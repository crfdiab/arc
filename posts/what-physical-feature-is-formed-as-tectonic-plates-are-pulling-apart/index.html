<h2 id=what-physical-feature-is-formed-as-tectonic-plates-are-pulling-apart>What physical feature is formed as tectonic plates are pulling apart?</h2>
<p>The plate below causes pressure and temperature to increase and can cause the mantle to melt and magma to rise, causing volcanoes. Divergent boundaries with two plates pulling apart, typically result in submarine volcanoes found thousands of meters below the ocean surface.]</p>
<h2 id=what-was-formed-when-the-african-plate>What was formed when the African plate?</h2>
<p>Components. The African Plate includes several cratons, stable blocks of old crust with deep roots in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, and less stable terranes, which came together to form the African continent during the assembly of the supercontinent Pangea around 250 million years ago.</p>
<h2 id=what-features-are-formed-due-to-plates-separating>What features are formed due to plates separating?</h2>
<p>Deep ocean trenches, volcanoes, island arcs, submarine mountain ranges, and fault lines are examples of features that can form along plate tectonic boundaries. Volcanoes are one kind of feature that forms along convergent plate boundaries, where two tectonic plates collide and one moves beneath the other.</p>
<h2 id=what-formed-where-the-african-and-arabian-plates-pulled-apart>What formed where the African and Arabian plates pulled apart?</h2>
<p>The Arabian Plate (Fig. 1) was formed distinctively after Africa and Arabia have being pulled apart by plate tectonic processes resulting in the detachment and the separation of Arabia from Africa due to the formation of the Red Sea rift. The Arabian Plate (Fig.</p>
<h2 id=how-deep-is-the-african-plate>How deep is the African plate?</h2>
<p>The African plate includes 0 age oceanic lithosphere created at the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden mid-ocean ridges, 175 Ma oceanic lithospheric, and > 2.5 Ga Archaean cratons that are more than 170 km thick.</p>
<h2 id=is-italy-on-the-african-plate>Is Italy on the African plate?</h2>
<p>Italy sits on the boundary between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, with the African plate diving down beneath the Eurasian plate, just to the east of Italy.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-two-plates-move-apart>What is it called when two plates move apart?</h2>
<p>The movement of the plates creates three types of tectonic boundaries: convergent, where plates move into one another; divergent, where plates move apart; and transform, where plates move sideways in relation to each other.</p>
<h2 id=when-two-of-earths-plates-pull-apart-it-is-called>When two of Earth’s plates pull apart it is called?</h2>
<p>Divergent or constructive plate boundaries. The plates diverge and this causes the construction of new rock. It happens when two tectonic plates pull apart and rock from the mantle rises up through the opening to form new surface rock when it cools.</p>
<h2 id=which-direction-are-the-arabian-plate-and-the-african-plate-moving>Which direction are the Arabian Plate and the African plate moving?</h2>
<table><tr><th>Arabian Plate</th></tr><tr><td>Movement1</td><td>North</td></tr><tr><td>Speed1</td><td>15–20 mm/year</td></tr><tr><td>Features</td><td>Arabian Peninsula, Gulf of Aden, Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf, Red Sea</td></tr><tr><td>1Relative to the African Plate</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-did-the-african-tectonic-plates-get-formed>How did the African tectonic plates get formed?</h2>
<p>Others suggest that the rift is formed due to the African megaplume which caused significant mantle deformation (Corti, 2009). Most recently, the rift is said to be controlled by oblique rifting conditions which lead to volcano-tectonic activity that initiated a strong feedback between deformation and magmatism.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-african-plate-west-of-the-east-african-rift>Is the African Plate west of the East African Rift?</h2>
<p>Tectonic plate underlying Africa west of the East African Rift. The African Plate is a major tectonic plate straddling the equator as well as the prime meridian.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-arabian-plate-moving-away-from-the-african-plate>Is the Arabian Plate moving away from the African Plate?</h2>
<p>Along its northeast margin, the African Plate is bounded by the Red Sea Rift where the Arabian Plate is moving away from the African Plate. The New England hotspot in the Atlantic Ocean has probably created a short line of mid- to late-Tertiary age seamounts on the African Plate but appears to be currently inactive.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-eurasian-and-african-plates-collide>What happens when the Eurasian and African plates collide?</h2>
<p>O. Adrian Pfiffner, in Reference Module in Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences, 2017 Collision between the two margins of the Eurasian and African plates, like the crash of two cars, led to severe deformation (folding and fracturing) of the rocks within the zone of contact.</p>
