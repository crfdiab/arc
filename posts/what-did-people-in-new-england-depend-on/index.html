<h2 id=what-did-people-in-new-england-depend-on>What did people in New England depend on?</h2>
<p>New England’s economy depended on the environment. Its location near the Atlantic Ocean along a jagged coastline determined how people made a living. People in New England made money through fishing, whaling, shipbuilding, trading in its port cities and providing naval supplies.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-new-england-colonies-similar-to-each-other>How were New England colonies similar to each other?</h2>
<p>Another similarity is that both regions were very active in the movement for independence. Lots of significant events occurred in both the Middle and New England colonies. These colonies were also different. There was more religious freedom in the Middle colonies than in the New England colonies.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-the-colonies-and-their-inhabitants-similar-to-each-other>How were the colonies and their inhabitants similar to each other?</h2>
<p>The colonies were alike in that they all had close ties to England. They were mainly inhabited by English-speaking people. Aside from some of Maryland, they were largely Protestant. They had their own forms of self-government, but they owed their allegiance to Parliament and the King.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-people-of-new-england-have-in-common>What did the people of New England have in common?</h2>
<p>The people of New England and the Chesapeake colonies formed different governments upon arrival to North America. They had different motives and incentives for immigrating to America.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-composition-of-the-new-england-colonies>What was the composition of the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>The composition of the colonists of New England and the Chesapeake area were nothing like one another during the settlement of the colonies.The people of the northern New England colonies and the southern Chesapeake colonies formed separate and different governments upon arrival in the New World.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-chesapeake-and-new-england-colonies-different>How are the Chesapeake and New England colonies different?</h2>
<p>The demographical and social makeup of the colonists of New England and the Chesapeake area were different from one another during the colonization of the settlements. The Chesapeake and New England colonies became two separate societies despite the fact that both emigrated from England.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-of-the-new-england-colonies>What was the religion of the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>The primary religion of the New England colonies was the strict Puritan Christianity originally brought to the Massachusetts Bay colony by ships like the Mayflower, but as the colonies grew and changed, some of the colonists began to move away from that base. So too did views on the Native Americans who shared their land.</p>
