<h2 id=should-the-voting-age-limit-be-lowered-to-16>Should the voting age limit be lowered to 16?</h2>
<p>A key argument put forward in favour of lowering the voting age is that the younger someone engages with the electoral process, the greater the chance they will become lifelong voters. Research shows that voting is habitual. Roughly 75% of 16- and 17-year-olds voted in the Scottish referendum.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-the-minimum-voting-age-be>What should the minimum voting age be?</h2>
<p>A voting age is a minimum age established by law that a person must attain before they become eligible to vote in a public election. As of the present day, the most common voting age is 18 years; however, voting ages as low as 16 and as high as 25 currently exist (see list below).</p>
<h2 id=what-year-was-voting-age-lowered-to-18>What year was voting age lowered to 18?</h2>
<p>The proposed 26th Amendment passed the House and Senate in the spring of 1971 and was ratified by the states on July 1, 1971.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-16-year-olds-voted-in-scotland>What percentage of 16 year olds voted in Scotland?</h2>
<p>At 1 December 2018, there were 78,400 young people aged 16 or 17 registered to vote at Scottish Parliament and Local Government elections, accounting for 1.9% of the total electorate. This is a decrease of 5,200 (6.2%) on the previous year.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-16-year-old-be-a-conscientious-voter>Can a 16 year old be a conscientious voter?</h2>
<p>Sure, your life experience is fairly limited at 16, and maturity levels vary wildly from person to person but plenty of 16-year-olds would be conscientious voters. And the ones who have no interest in politics – well, like in every age group, they probably just won’t bother voting.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-16-and-17-year-olds-engage-in-civics>When do 16 and 17 year olds engage in civics?</h2>
<p>When 16- and 17-year-olds engage in civics, conversations about politics and local issues are brought to the dinner table. Parents and family members are engaged in civic life through the 16- and 17-year-olds in their household, with a positive impact on voter turnout for people of all ages.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-decisions-made-by-a-16-year-old>How are decisions made by a 16 year old?</h2>
<p>10% of a teen’s decisions come from their home environment. Children at the age of 16 are still influenced by their parent’s behaviors, standards, and perspectives. Kids pattern their belief structures, from spirituality to politics, on the ideas they see and hear at home.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-teens-at-the-age-of-16>What happens to teens at the age of 16?</h2>
<p>They have higher smoking rates, higher texting while driving rates, and practice safe-sex less often. Teens at the age of 16 are going through physical changes, including brain development, which creates emotional instabilities that lead to rebellion.</p>
