<h2 id=can-social-security-benefits-be-part-of-a-divorce-settlement>Can Social Security benefits be part of a divorce settlement?</h2>
<p>Under federal law, Social Security benefits may not be divided as community or marital property upon divorce. Courts have held that Social Security benefits are a legal entitlement, and therefore are exempt from the property division process in divorce proceedings.</p>
<h2 id=is-social-security-disability-considered-income-in-a-divorce>Is Social Security Disability considered income in a divorce?</h2>
<p>Although SSDI benefits generally aren’t considered marital property, depositing such funds into a joint account might result in a 50:50 division in a state with an equal property division divorce statute. When calculating alimony, SSDI payments are considered income, while SSI is not.</p>
<h2 id=is-social-security-disability-community-property>Is Social Security disability community property?</h2>
<p>Though pension benefits are community property under California law, Social Security benefits are not, because federal law trumps, or preempts, California law.</p>
<h2 id=can-my-ex-wife-get-my-social-security-disability>Can my ex wife get my Social Security disability?</h2>
<p>Your ex-spouse is entitled to Social Security retirement or disability benefits. If your ex-spouse hasn’t applied for benefits, but can qualify for them and is age 62 or older, you can receive benefits on his or her work record if you’ve been divorced for at least two years.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-ss-divided-in-a-divorce>How is SS divided in a divorce?</h2>
<p>Social Security Is Not Divided Like Other Retirement Funds When a couple gets divorced, pensions and retirement accounts are generally split in a procedure known as equitable distribution or asset division. There is no procedure for including Social Security payments in the division of assets during a divorce.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-divorce-affect-social-security-disability>How does divorce affect Social Security disability?</h2>
<p>If you receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI, or SSD) based on your own work history, your payments will not be affected by your divorce because the amount of the disability payment is dependent on your work history alone, and not your spouse’s.</p>
<h2 id=what-benefits-can-i-get-if-i-separate-from-my-husband>What benefits can I get if I separate from my husband?</h2>

<h2 id=is-social-security-disability-subject-to-alimony>Is Social Security disability subject to alimony?</h2>
<p>Are Disability Benefit Payments Considered When Calculating Alimony? SSDI benefits are generally considered income when determining alimony or spousal support awards. SSI payments are not.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-divorced-woman-collect-her-ex-husbands-social-security>Can a divorced woman collect her ex husband’s Social Security?</h2>
<p>A divorced spouse may be eligible to collect Social Security benefits based on the former spouse’s work record. If the requirements are met, the divorced spouse can receive an amount equal to as much as 50% of their ex’s benefits.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-get-half-of-my-husbands-401k-in-a-divorce>Do I get half of my husband’s 401K in a divorce?</h2>
<p>Any funds contributed to the 401(k) account during the marriage are marital property and subject to division during the divorce, unless there is a valid prenuptial agreement in place. For example, if your spouse also has a retirement account worth a similar amount, you may each decide to keep your own accounts.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-judge-divide-property-in-a-nevada-divorce>Can a judge divide property in a Nevada divorce?</h2>
<p>Yes, Nevada is among the eleven states that follow community property principles. The majority of these states are western states. Most states have enacted equitable distribution laws, but Nevada isn’t one of them. Under Nevada community property laws, a judge divide a couple’s property equally in a divorce.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-retirement-accounts-divided-in-a-nevada-divorce>How are retirement accounts divided in a Nevada divorce?</h2>
<p>If you have questions about dividing retirement accounts in your Nevada divorce, contact a local family law attorney for advice. Although community property is generally divided equally in a divorce, you and your spouse can reach agreements on property division on your own or with the help of a mediator.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-marital-assets-divided-in-nevada-law>How are marital assets divided in Nevada law?</h2>
<p>Nevada divides marital assets under community property law, which means that property and assets acquired during a marriage are jointly owned by both spouses, regardless of who purchased it or whose name is on the title. In most cases, community property will be divided 50/50 between the spouses.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-in-a-divorce-in-las-vegas>What happens in a divorce in Las Vegas?</h2>
<p>A divorce is a legal judgment terminating a Nevada marriage. During divorce proceedings, a court determines the division of community property and alimony payments. If the couple has children under 18, the court also determines child custody and child support. 1. Who can file for divorce in Nevada?</p>
