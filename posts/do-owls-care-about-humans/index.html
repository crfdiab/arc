<h2 id=do-owls-care-about-humans>Do owls care about humans?</h2>
<p>Owls typically do not pay attention to humans. As with most birds of prey, it’s not a good idea to approach a wild owl, especially if it’s exhibiting aggressive behavior. That being said, some people have trained owls as pets, although it is best to let these majestic birds stay wild.</p>

<h2 id=how-do-you-know-if-an-owl-is-happy>How do you know if an owl is happy?</h2>

<h2 id=why-are-owls-so-dangerous>Why are owls so dangerous?</h2>
<p>Owl wings and feathers have special adaptations to muffle their sound. It’s stealth, not speed that makes them deadly. They have extremely powerful low-light vision, and finely tuned hearing which allows them to locate the source of even the smallest sound.</p>

<p>Owls are raptors and are known to be efficient hunters. Most attack their prey from above.
