<h2 id=when-did-the-aztecs-move-into-central-mexico>When did the Aztecs move into central Mexico?</h2>
<p>13th century<br>
The legendary origin of the Aztec people has them migrating from a homeland called Aztlan to what would become modern-day Mexico. While it is not clear where Aztlan was, a number of scholars believe that the Mexica—as the Aztec referred to themselves—migrated south to central Mexico in the 13th century.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-aztecs-live-in-mexico>When did the Aztecs live in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Aztec, self name Culhua-Mexica, Nahuatl-speaking people who in the 15th and early 16th centuries ruled a large empire in what is now central and southern Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-aztecs-settle-in-central-mexico>Where did the Aztecs settle in central Mexico?</h2>
<p>Where was it located? Tenochtitlan was located on a swampy island in Lake Texcoco in what is today south central Mexico. The Aztecs were able to settle there because no one else wanted the land. At first, it wasn’t a great place to start a city, but soon the Aztecs built up islands where they could grow crops.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-aztecs-settle-in-the-valley-of-mexico>When did the Aztecs settle in the Valley of Mexico?</h2>
<p>about 1300 A.D.<br>
The Aztecs arrived in the Valley of Mexico as homeless wanderers about 1300 A.D. They came the region above the Gulf of California.</p>
<h2 id=what-made-the-valley-of-mexico-a-good-place-to-live>What made the Valley of Mexico a good place to live?</h2>
<p>Not only were they very clever people, but they had every faith that their main god had sent them to the swampy shores of Lake Texcoco, so obviously this place was perfect for them. They adapted to their environment. They built canoes, so they could fish and hunt birds that lived near the water.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-valley-of-mexico-a-good-place-to-settle>Why was the Valley of Mexico a good place to settle?</h2>
<p>Why was Tenochtitlán a good place for the Aztecs to settle? It was easy to defend, they were known as fierce warrior and they often served as mercenaries. It was a rich source of food. It was easy to get there for trading.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-aztecs-migrate-to-central-mexico>When did the Aztecs migrate to central Mexico?</h2>
<p>This myth coincides with the known history of the Aztecs as a barbarous horde that migrated into the central plateau of Mexico in approximately 1193 A.D. They founded their capital, Tenochtitlan, on an island on Lake Texcoco circa 1202 — having subsisted in the area for most of the intervening years.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-location-of-the-aztec-empire>Where was the location of the Aztec Empire?</h2>
<p>This multi-ethnic, multi-lingual realm stretched for more than 80,000 square miles through many parts of what are now central and southern Mexico. The Aztec Empire stretched from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf coast and from central Mexico to the present-day Republic of Guatemala.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-aztecs-live-during-the-post-classic-period>Where did the Aztecs Live during the Post Classic period?</h2>
<p>The Aztecs(/ˈæztɛks/) were a Mesoamericanculture that flourished in central Mexicoin the post-classic period from 1300 to 1521. The Aztec peoples included different ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl languageand who dominated large parts of Mesoamericafrom the 14th to the 16th centuries.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-mexica-come-to-the-valley-of-mexico>When did the Mexica come to the valley of Mexico?</h2>
<p>From the 13th century, the Valley of Mexico was the heart of dense population and the rise of city-states. The Mexica were late-comers to the Valley of Mexico, and founded the city-state of Tenochtitlan on unpromising islets in Lake Texcoco, later becoming the dominant power of the Aztec Triple Alliance or Aztec Empire.</p>
