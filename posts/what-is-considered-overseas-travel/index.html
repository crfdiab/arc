<h2 id=what-is-considered-overseas-travel>What is considered overseas travel?</h2>
<p>Overseas = Any country or place beyond the CONUS. Alaska, Hawaii and the U.S. territories are considered overseas under the Space-A Regulation.</p>
<h2 id=is-mexico-considered-abroad>Is Mexico considered abroad?</h2>
<p>Is Mexico Considered International Travel? Yes. Mexico is considered international travel from the United States whether you arrive by car, plane or cruise ship. A valid U.S. passport book is your best way to enter Mexico, and the only way to enter if flying to Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=what-documents-do-i-need-to-travel-international>What documents do I need to travel international?</h2>
<p>These IDs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. passport.</li>
<li>U.S. passport card.</li>
<li>DHS “Trusted Traveler” cards (Global Entry®, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)</li>
<li>U.S. Military ID.</li>
<li>Permanent Resident Card.</li>
<li>Border Crossing Card.</li>
<li>DHS-designated enhanced driver’s license.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=do-i-need-a-passport-to-fly-internationally>Do I need a passport to fly internationally?</h2>
<p>A passport is required for all international travel. If you’re traveling anywhere overseas, you need a passport to board an international flight and to enter the country. Passport cards will not be accepted as form of I.D. You may be denied boarding if you travel with a passport that appears damaged or altered.</p>
<h2 id=is-flying-from-canada-to-mexico-considered-international>Is flying from Canada to Mexico considered international?</h2>
<p>Flights to Canada and Mexico are both considered international flights.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-fly-internationally-right-now>Can you fly internationally right now?</h2>
<p>A Country-by-country Guide. From lounging on Caribbean beaches to sightseeing in Europe, Americans now have options when it comes to international travel. Additionally, vaccinated travelers are now allowed to travel freely, according to updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-use-real-id-to-travel-to-mexico>Can I use Real ID to travel to Mexico?</h2>
<p>No. REAL ID cards cannot be used for border crossings into Canada, Mexico or other international travel.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-fly-with-a-passport-from-another-country>Can you fly with a passport from another country?</h2>
<p>Can I fly with a foreign passport or Employment Authorization Document Card? Yes, as noted above, the list of approved identification to fly domestically includes foreign government-issued passports and/or a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Authorization Card (I-766).</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-2-ids-to-fly-internationally>Do you need 2 IDs to fly internationally?</h2>
<p>Immigration documents and identification cards are allowed for both international and national air travel. Allowed identification documents include resident alien cards, border crossing cards and passports from a foreign country.</p>
<h2 id=what-documents-do-you-need-to-fly-internationally>What documents do you need to fly internationally?</h2>
<h2 id=why-is-flying-from-the-us-to-mexico-not-considered-international>Why is flying from the US to Mexico not considered international?</h2>
<p>Applies to all citizens, US or other countries. That flight from US to Mexico IS considered international. You had to go through immigration and customs in Mexico upon arrival. Airports may have an “international terminal” but using this terminal does not necessarily make a flight international, and vice versa. What does Google know about me?</p>
<h2 id=where-is-mexico-located-in-relation-to-the-united-states>Where is Mexico located in relation to the United States?</h2>
<p>Mexico is an impressive, world-known country in North America, located between the United States of America to the north, and Guatemala and Belize to the southeast. It proudly boasts extensive coastline stretching along with more than 10,000km, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-overseas-country-of-the-united-states>Which is an overseas country of the United States?</h2>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-travel-to-the-whole-of-mexico>Is it safe to travel to the whole of Mexico?</h2>
<p>The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the whole of Mexico based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks. Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Mexico’s current entry restrictions and requirements.</p>
