<h2 id=how-did-michael-faraday-discover-electromagnetic-induction>How did Michael Faraday Discover electromagnetic induction?</h2>
<p>Faraday made his first discovery of electromagnetism in 1821. He repeated Oersted’s experiment placing a small magnet around a current-carrying wire and verified that the force exerted by the current on the magnet was circular.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-michael-faraday-do-when-he-discovered-that-changing-a-magnetic-field-created-an-electric-current-in-a-wire>What did Michael Faraday do when he discovered that changing a magnetic field created an electric current in a wire?</h2>
<p>Faraday connected his apparatus to a battery, which sent electricity through the wire creating a magnetic field around it. This field interacted with the field around the magnet and caused the wire to rotate clockwise. This discovery led Faraday to contemplate the nature of electricity.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-the-magnetic-field>Who discovered the magnetic field?</h2>
<p>Nikola Tesla , was experimenting on generators and he discovered the rotating magnetic field in 1883, which is the principle of alternating current.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-electromagnetic-induction-according-to-michael-faraday>What is an electromagnetic induction according to Michael Faraday?</h2>
<p>Electromagnetic or magnetic induction is the production of an electromotive force across an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic field. Michael Faraday is generally credited with the discovery of induction in 1831, and James Clerk Maxwell mathematically described it as Faraday’s law of induction.</p>
<h2 id=who-gave-the-theory-of-electromagnetic-induction>Who gave the theory of electromagnetic induction?</h2>
<p>Michael Faraday<br>
On 29 August 1831 Michael Faraday discovered the induction of one current by another in his famous induction ring experiment familiar to every student of physics (Fig.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-current-is-removed-from-an-electromagnet>What happens when the current is removed from an electromagnet?</h2>
<p>The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-the-relationship-between-electricity-and-magnetism>Who discovered the relationship between electricity and magnetism?</h2>
<p>Hans Christian Oersted<br>
Also, a changing magnetic field will produce an electric current in a wire or conductor. Therefore, the relationship between electricity and magnetism was discovered by Hans Christian Oersted.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-faraday-prove-that-an-electric-current-can-be-induced>How did Faraday prove that an electric current can be induced?</h2>
<p>He also demonstrated that an electric current can be induced by moving a magnet, by turning an electromagnet on and off, and even by moving an electric wire in Earth’s magnetic field. Within a few months, Faraday built the first, albeit primitive, electric generator.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-faraday-and-maxwell-discover-about-magnetic-fields>What did Faraday and Maxwell discover about magnetic fields?</h2>
<p>While Faraday had discovered that changes in magnetic fields produce electric fields, Maxwell added the converse: changes in electric fields produce magnetic fields even in the absence of electric currents.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-michael-faraday-contribute-to-the-field-of-physics>How did Michael Faraday contribute to the field of Physics?</h2>
<p>It was by his research on the magnetic field around a conductor carrying a direct current that Faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics. Faraday also established that magnetism could affect rays of light and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-james-clerk-maxwell-write-faradays-law>When did James Clerk Maxwell write Faraday’s Law?</h2>
<p>When it was moved in or out of a larger coil, its magnetic field induced a momentary voltage in the small coil that was detected by a galvanometer. Scottish mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831 – 1879) expressed the time varying aspect of electromagnetic induction as a differential equation that became known as Faraday’s Law.</p>
