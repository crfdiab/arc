<p>Clearly, the Caravel revolutionized European transportation. This technology made it possible for European explorers, fishermen, and merchants to “expand their horizons,” by providing the ability to travel further, faster. One could argue that it played a major role in the rapid colonization of the New World.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-portuguese-invention-of-the-caravel-significant>Why was the Portuguese invention of the caravel significant?</h2>
<p>Apparently developed by the Portuguese for exploring the coast of Africa, the caravel’s chief excellence lay in its capacity for sailing to windward. It was also capable of remarkable speed. Two of the three ships in which Christopher Columbus made his historic voyage in 1492 were caravels, the Niña and the Pinta.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-some-of-the-advantages-the-caravel-provided-for-explorers>What were some of the advantages the caravel provided for explorers?</h2>
<p>Although by the early 15th century, the caravel had highly admirable qualities, it was still far from ideal. The main reasons it was chosen for the exploration of the African coast were speed and the ability to sail windward.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-caravel-useful>How was the caravel useful?</h2>
<p>CARAVEL. The Iberian workhorse known as the caravel was one of the most important ships not only in Iberian history, but in the history of the world. The caravel was a vessel of paramount importance in the 15th and 16th centuries, when it was used to traverse the immense barrier to the New World.</p>

<p>Caravels grew larger and more spacious as the turn of the 16th century approached. As the caravel did not go deep, it was the proper ship for exploration of river discharges in shallow waters. With the help of the Latin seal it was able to quickly cross shallow areas in strong winds, gaining great speed.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-portuguese-learn-by-diass-accomplishments>What did the Portuguese learn by Dias’s accomplishments?</h2>
<p>In 1488, Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias (c. 1450-1500) became the first European mariner to round the southern tip of Africa, opening the way for a sea route from Europe to Asia. A major maritime victory for Portugal, Dias’ breakthrough opened the door to increased trade with India and other Asian powers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-caravel-help-the-age-of-exploration>How did the caravel help the age of exploration?</h2>
<p>The caravel was created by Prince Henry, a portuguese explorer. He needed a ship that would be able to sail near the rocky coast of Africa and connect him to the Indies for trade. The first improvement were its lateen sails. They were triangular sails that helped travel against wind and increased the speed of the ship.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-portuguese-start-using-the-caravel>When did the Portuguese start using the caravel?</h2>
<p>Caravels were used by the Portuguese and Castilians for the oceanic exploration voyages during the 15th and the 16th centuries, during the Age of Discovery .</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-caravel-important-to-the-castilians>Why was the caravel important to the Castilians?</h2>
<p>The lateen sails gave it speed and the capacity for sailing windward ( beating ). Caravels were used by the Portuguese and Castilians (Spain) for the oceanic exploration voyages during the 15th and 16th centuries in the Age of Discovery .</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-caravel-the-best-sailing-vessel>Why was the caravel the best sailing vessel?</h2>
<p>With the lateen sails attached, it was highly maneuverable and could sail much nearer the shore, while with the square Atlantic-type sails attached, it was very fast. Its economy, speed, agility, and power made it esteemed as the best sailing vessel of its time.</p>
