<h2 id=how-did-european-expansion-impact-european-society-how-did-european-expansion-impact-native-american-society>How did European expansion impact European society how did European expansion impact Native American society?</h2>
<p>Colonization ruptured many ecosystems, bringing in new organisms while eliminating others. The Europeans brought many diseases with them, which decimated Native American populations. They also carried diseases against which the Indian peoples had no defenses. …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-significance-of-the-difference-between-central-south-america-and-north-america>What is the significance of the difference between central South America and North America?</h2>
<p>North American societies were smaller and less civilized. Explain the significance of the difference between Central/South America and North America. North Americans hunted, farmed, and made tools while South Americans traded, created calendars, and had highly organized societies.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-major-difference-between-the-early-viking-voyages-of-the-12th-century-to-columbuss-voyages-in-the-15th-century>Why was the major difference between the early Viking voyages of the 12th century to Columbus’s voyages in the 15th century?</h2>
<p>The Viking age is considered from about 790 to the 12th century, in their raids the Vikings made many voyages but the key difference between them and Columbus was that they did not stay or could not had a lasting impact on the people or places they went while Columbus did that by bringing people into contact.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-catholic-victory-in-spain-and-the-european-reformation-on-north-america-quizlet>What was the impact of the Catholic victory in Spain and the European Reformation on North America quizlet?</h2>
<p>What was the impact of the Catholic victory in Spain and the European reformation in north america? Catholic victory in Spain showed clearly the intolerance for non catholics. Reformation had an impact because many people traveled to NA for religious freedom and to spread their religion.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-1607-a-major-turning-point-in-american-history>Why is 1607 a major turning point in American history?</h2>
<p>1607 is a turning point in American history because it marks the beginning of England’s colonization of the eastern seaboard in the North American continent. The success of this colony resulted in the migration of thousands of British citizens to North America in hopes of a better life.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-think-were-the-most-important-long-term-consequences-of-the-spanish-and-english-colonies-in-america>What do you think were the most important long term consequences of the Spanish and English colonies in America?</h2>
<p>I think that the three most important long-term consequences of Columbus’s encounters with the Americans were slavery, spread disease through the Columbian exchange, and new rivalries in Europe. There were some positive outcomes from these things to suggest the exchange of the new exotic plants and animals.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-catholic-victory-in-spain>What was the impact of the Catholic victory in Spain?</h2>
<p>Impact of Catholic victory in Spain and European Reformation on North America conflict between Catholic and Protestant led to a series of religious War The English Model: 3 colonies: corporate, royal, proprietary compare and contrast English colonization to the French and Spanish</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-protestant-reformation-affect-the-catholic-church>How did the Protestant Reformation affect the Catholic Church?</h2>
<p>The challenge of the Protestant Reformation became also an occasion for a resurgent Roman Catholicism to clarify and to reaffirm Roman Catholic principles; that endeavour had, in one sense, never been absent from the life and teaching of the church, but it was undertaken now with new force.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-victory-of-the-counter-reformation>Where was the victory of the Counter Reformation?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most complete victory for the Counter-Reformation was the restoration of Roman Catholic domination in Poland and in Hussite Bohemia. The victory of the Habsburg Counter-Reformation in Bohemia and the defeat of Czech Protestantism were a consequence of the Battle of White Mountain (1620), in the early years of the Thirty Years’ War.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-spanish-armada>What was the outcome of the Spanish Armada?</h2>
<p>If the Armada had been successful then it seems likely that a Catholic king or queen would have been placed on the throne. They would have had the power to overturn the Protestant establishment in the country. No longer would the Church of England be the state church and once again the Catholic Church would have been the only recognized religion.</p>
