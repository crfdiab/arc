<h2 id=is-it-bad-to-live-at-high-altitude>Is it bad to live at high altitude?</h2>
<p>Living at high altitude reduces risk of dying from heart disease: Low oxygen may spur genes to create blood vessels. Summary: Researchers have found that people living at higher altitudes have a lower chance of dying from heart disease and live longer.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-difficult-for-organisms-to-live-on-high-altitudes>Why is it difficult for organisms to live on high altitudes?</h2>
<p>Organisms can live at high altitude, either on land, in water, or while flying. Decreased oxygen availability and decreased temperature make life at such altitudes challenging, though many species have been successfully adapted via considerable physiological changes.</p>
<h2 id=can-humans-survive-high-altitudes>Can humans survive high altitudes?</h2>
<p>Humans can survive at high altitudes. However, if you go to a high altitude, your body needs to adjust properly by getting used to it slowly or you could get very sick and even die. There are many people who live and work at high altitudes.</p>
<h2 id=why-cant-people-breathe-on-mountains>Why can’t people breathe on mountains?</h2>
<p>The air at higher altitudes is colder, less dense, and contains fewer oxygen molecules. This means that you need to take more breaths in order to get the same amount of oxygen as you would at lower altitudes. The higher the elevation, the more difficult breathing becomes.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-breathe-10000-feet>Can you breathe 10000 feet?</h2>
<p>At 10,000 feet above sea level, the normal saturation for a human breathing regular air is 87 percent. Go to 18,000 feet without supplemental oxygen and the saturation drops to 80 percent (thanks to the partial pressure of oxygen being just 21 percent of the atmospheric pressure at any altitude).</p>
<h2 id=do-you-age-faster-in-mountains>Do you age faster in mountains?</h2>
<p>Women who live at high altitudes are likely to age faster, research suggests. Scientists drew their conclusions after finding lower concentrations of hormones, which are important for maintaining health and youthfulness, in women living in the mountainous areas of Peru.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-not-live-in-the-mountains>Why do people not live in the mountains?</h2>
<p>People prefer to not live in the mountains because: 1. The temperature gets higher lower as you go up the mountain and it is hard to adjust. Very low temperatures are Hazardous; 2. The soil is bad for growing food; 3.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-people-who-live-in-mountainous-regions-almost-impossible-to-understand>Who are people who live in mountainous regions almost impossible to understand?</h2>
<p>Inevitably outsiders who enter the mountains get drawn into these feuds although they rarely understand them. In her book No Friends but the Mountains, Judith Matloff takes the reader on an intimate tour of mountain societies from the Sierra Madre to the Caucasus to the Himalayas and Andes.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-living-at-high-altitudes>What are the pros and cons of living at high altitudes?</h2>
<p>But with the many pros come a few cons, such as less oxygen and thin air, which can be tough on the body. Find out if living “the high life” is right for you. The highest-altitude city on earth is El Alto, Bolivia. Over one million people live approximately 13,615 feet above sea level.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-some-people-get-sick-at-altitude>Why do some people get sick at altitude?</h2>
<p>Altitude Sickness: Genetics May Explain Why Only Some Fall Ill. The genetic changes, described today (Aug. 15) in the American Journal of Human Genetics, allow people to take in enough oxygen from the thin mountain air without developing the heart attacks and strokes of chronic mountain sickness.</p>
