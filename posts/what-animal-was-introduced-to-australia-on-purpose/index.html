<p>In the future, a combination of biological and conventional control methods may be able to reduce the damage foxes cause. The European red fox was deliberately introduced to Australia for recreational hunting in 1855 and fox populations became established in the wild in the early 1870s.</p>

The first placental mammal introduced to Australia was the dingo. Fossil evidence suggests that people from the north brought the dingo to Australia about 5000 years ago. When Europeans settled Australia they intentionally released many species into the wild including the red fox, brown hare, and the European rabbit.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-have-been-introduced-to-australia>What kind of animals have been introduced to Australia?</h2>
<p>Ever since, they have been brought from other countries and released into the Australian environment, sometimes with the best of intentions, sometimes not. Since colonisation, many species of animal have been introduced into Australia from other countries. They include cane toads, goats, foxes, deer, rabbits, pigs, cats, dogs and horses.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-are-the-animals-that-live-in-australia>How big are the animals that live in Australia?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most iconic Australian animal, Kangaroos are marsupials that are indigenous to the country. According to the Australian government, there are approximately 34 million kangaroos in the country. The largest species is the red kangaroo which stands over 6 feet tall.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-are-found-in-the-outback-of-australia>What kind of animals are found in the outback of Australia?</h2>
<p>The reason kangaroo is one of the most popular Australian Outback animals found in the opal fields is that they easily withstand the dry climate. Additionally, their fast movements enable them to quickly traverse across the Outback in search of food and water. You’ll find a vast population of lizards in the Outback, starting with the Sand Goanna.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-birds-can-you-find-in-australia>What kind of birds can you find in Australia?</h2>
<p>Half of the birds that live in Australia, can only be found there. Among the typical Australian bird species are the kookaburras, the emu and the rainbow lorikeet, an especially colourful parrot which has a red beak and a multicolour plumage.</p>
