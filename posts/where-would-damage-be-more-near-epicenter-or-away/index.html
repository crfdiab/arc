<h2 id=where-would-damage-be-more-near-epicenter-or-away>Where would damage be more near epicenter or away?</h2>
<p>Answer: Earthquakes are stronger on the epicenter. Thus, it should be having more damage near the epicenter.</p>
<h2 id=where-would-be-the-intensity-be-higher-near-the-epicenter-or-away-from-the-epicenter>Where would be the intensity be higher near the epicenter or away from the epicenter?</h2>
<p>Answer: Intensity is stronger near the epicenter. The damage of an earthquake is primarily caused by seismic waves. The intensity of these seismic waves reduce as they move away from the epicenter because they have to cover a larger radius, and the wave energy have to be distributed in a wider circle.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-earthquake-damage-greater-near-the-focus-or-the-epicenter>Where is the earthquake damage greater near the focus or the epicenter?</h2>
<p>Overview of Elastic Rebound Theory The epicenter is the point on the land surface that is directly above the focus. In about 75% of earthquakes, the focus is in the top 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) of the crust. Shallow earthquakes cause the most damage because the focus is near where people live.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-areas-far-away-from-the-epicenter-sometimes>Why do areas far away from the epicenter sometimes?</h2>
<p>Areas that are perpendicular to the fault are not as affected as those that are in line with it. The Magnitude of the earthquake can also affect the damage. The secondary S waves are the once that are. As the waves get further away from the epicenter the amount of time between the two waves increases, this causes the area to receive more damage.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-damage-near-the-epicentre-of-an-earthquake>What causes damage near the epicentre of an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Damage from Earthquakes. Ground Shaking: Shaking of the ground caused by the passage of seismic waves near the epicenter of the earthquake is responsible for the collapse of most structures. The intensity of ground-shaking depends on distance from epicenter and on the type of bedrock underlying the area.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-feel-an-earthquake-at-the-epicenter>Can you feel an earthquake at the epicenter?</h2>
<p>A vessel (or even a swimmer) on the ocean at the epicentre might barely notice even a large earthquake – shaking would only be noticed by an observer on land at some distance from the epicentre. You may get some disturbance of the body of water (especially if the water depth is shallow) but you are unlikely to experience severe shaking.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-intensity-of-an-earthquake-decrease>Where does the intensity of an earthquake decrease?</h2>
<p>Also the main intensity may be from falling material, away from the epicenter, you just cant say. The intensity of an earthquake decreases away from the epicenter, as you move farther from the source. Not perfectly radial, however, as rock properties may vary.</p>
