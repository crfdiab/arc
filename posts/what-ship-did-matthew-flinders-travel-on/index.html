<p>Reliance<br>
After sailing with the famous Captain Bligh on the Providence, Flinders’ adventures brought him to Australia onboard the Reliance. In 1796 he explored the coastline around Sydney in a tiny open boat called Tom Thumb.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-nicolas-baudins-ship>What is the name of Nicolas Baudin’s ship?</h2>
<p>In October 1800, Baudin was selected by Bonaparte to lead what has become known as the Baudin expedition to map the coast of New Holland. He had two ships, Géographe and Naturaliste captained by Hamelin, and a suite of nine zoologists and botanists, including Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour.</p>

<p>Australia<br>
Flinders entered the Royal Navy in 1789 and became a navigator. In 1795 he sailed to Australia, where he explored and charted its southeast coast and circumnavigated the island of Tasmania. As commander of the Investigator, he again sailed from England for Australia in 1801.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-nicolas-baudin-travel>Why did Nicolas Baudin travel?</h2>
<p>Baudin was seconded to the Archduke Francis of Austria, and in 1792 took charge of a scientific expedition to the Indian Ocean to collect plants and specimens for the palace of enlightenment at Schönbrunn.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-matthew-flinders-first-land-on-kangaroo-island>When did Matthew Flinders first land on Kangaroo Island?</h2>
<p>When Captain Matthew Flinders first landed on Kangaroo Island on March 23, 1802, there was no sign of human inhabitants. Flinders was a British explorer commanding HMS Investigator on the second circumnavigation of New Holland, a land he would ultimately name ‘Australia or Terra Australis’.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-investigator-strait-named-after-matthew-flinders>Why was Investigator Strait named after Matthew Flinders?</h2>
<p>Investigator Strait, the stretch of water that lies between southern Yorke Peninsula and Kangaroo Island, was named by Captain Matthew Flinders on 27 March 1802 in honour of his ship HMS Investigator. Investigator Strait formed the major channel for access to Port Adelaide by ships arriving from Europe, and the use of this seaway came at a cost.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-flinders-and-baudin-sail-in-1802>Where did Flinders and Baudin sail in 1802?</h2>
<p>On April 8, 1802, Flinders HMS Investigator and Baudin’s Le Géographe had a chance encounter as Flinders was sailing east along the ‘Unknown Coast’ of South Australia from Kangaroo Island, and Baudin west along the Coorong and Victorian coastline.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-first-ship-to-crash-on-kangaroo-island>What was the name of the first ship to crash on Kangaroo Island?</h2>
<p>These were located at Doyle’s Bay, D’Estrees Bay and Hog Bay. Numerous ships have been wrecked on the Kangaroo Island coastline. The earliest was the cutter William (20 tons), which was wrecked while trying to enter Hog Bay on 23 August 1847. The largest vessel lost was Portland Maru (5,865 tons), which sank at Cape Torrens on 20 March 1935.</p>
