<h2 id=what-are-the-negative-effects-of-globalization-industry>What are the negative effects of globalization industry?</h2>
<p>They may pollute the environment, run risks with safety or impose poor working conditions and low wages on local workers. Globalisation is viewed by many as a threat to the world’s cultural diversity.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-negative-effects-of-globalization-to-haiti>What are the negative effects of globalization to Haiti?</h2>
<p>Globalization has impacted poverty in Haiti by free trading and many workers works unpaid for many international factories. For many years Haiti was the center of tourism, which was helping the economy, but now it has declined as a source of income .</p>
<h2 id=how-is-haiti-affected-by-globalization>How is Haiti affected by globalization?</h2>
<p>Globalization has caused significant migration of Haitians to other countries for work. This has positively impacted those with enough means to travel and find employment. With rampant poverty, many Haitians are anxious to leave their nation in search of a better life elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-globalisation-bad-for-the-environment>How is Globalisation bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>Increased greenhouse gas emissions, ocean acidification, deforestation (and other forms of habitat loss or destruction), climate change, and the introduction of invasive species all work to reduce biodiversity around the globe.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-cultural-influences-of-other-countries-to-haiti>What are the cultural influences of other countries to Haiti?</h2>
<p>The culture of Haiti is an eclectic mix of African, Taino and European elements due to the French colonization of Saint Domingue and its large and diverse enslaved African population, as is evidenced in the Haitian language, music, and religion.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-dangers-of-globalization>What are the dangers of globalization?</h2>
<p>7 Risks for the Global Economy</p>
<ul>
<li>Business as Usual.</li>
<li>#1: Global Excess Liquidity.</li>
<li>#2: Growing Debt.</li>
<li>#3: Increasing Protectionism.</li>
<li>#4: Escalation of Geopolitical Conflicts.</li>
<li>#5: Increase in Social Instabilities.</li>
<li>#6: Rising Interest Rates in the U.S.</li>
<li>#7: Technological Disruptions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-are-so-many-americans-working-in-haiti>Why are so many Americans working in Haiti?</h2>
<p>Haiti is desperately poor and has horrible health statistics, so in some ways it makes sense that many non-Haitians, especially Americans given its proximity, work in NGOs in the country. The benefits and harms of the large numbers of foreign NGOs within the country are examined in scholarly literature (see Schuller 2007, for example).</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-united-states-take-president-aristide>Where did the United States take President Aristide?</h2>
<p>On February 28 th, 2004, Aristide was taken from the country by the Haitian and American militaries and flown to South Africa, where he is still in exile (see Farmer 2006). The United States’ role in both the coups against Aristide have been disputed.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-united-states-influence-haitis-destiny>How did the United States influence Haiti’s Destiny?</h2>
<p>In addition, the influence of external actors such as the U.S. on Haiti’s destiny is also looked at. Before the discovery of Hispaniola (the island that is now Haiti and the Dominican Republic) by Christopher Columbus, there was a thriving civilization of native Americans, known as the Arawak-speaking Taino Indians.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-before-christopher-columbus-came-to-haiti>What was life like before Christopher Columbus came to Haiti?</h2>
<p>Before the discovery of Hispaniola (the island that is now Haiti and the Dominican Republic) by Christopher Columbus, there was a thriving civilization of native Americans, known as the Arawak-speaking Taino Indians. The arrival of Columbus and European colonialism brought disease, slavery, misery and death.</p>
