<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-dawes-act-quizlet>What was the result of the Dawes Act quizlet?</h2>
<p>The Dawes Act outlawed tribal ownership of land and forced 160-acre homesteads into the hands of individual Indians and their families with the promise of future citizenship. As it turned out, the Dawes Act succeeded only in stripping tribes of their land and failed to incorporate Native Americans into U.S. society.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-dawes-act>What was the outcome of the Dawes Act?</h2>
<p>The objective of the Dawes Act was to assimilate Native Americans into mainstream US society by annihilating their cultural and social traditions. As a result of the Dawes Act, over ninety million acres of tribal land were stripped from Native Americans and sold to non-natives.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-dawes-act-so-unsuccessful>Why was the Dawes Act so unsuccessful?</h2>
<p>The Dawes Act failed because the plots were too small for sustainable agriculture. The Native American Indians lacked tools, money, experience or expertise in farming. The farming lifestyle was a completely alien way of life. The Bureau of Indian Affairs failed to manage the process fairly or efficiently.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-dawes-act-allow-the-president-to-do-quizlet>What did the Dawes Act allow the president to do quizlet?</h2>
<p>The Dawes Act (sometimes called the Dawes Severalty Act or General Allotment Act), passed in 1887 under President Grover Cleveland, allowed the federal government to break up tribal lands. Only the Native Americans who accepted the division of tribal lands were allowed to become US citizens.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-the-dawes-act-benefit-quizlet>Who did the Dawes Act benefit quizlet?</h2>
<p>A federal law intended to turn Native Americans into farmers and landowners by providing cooperating families with 160 acres of reservation land for farming or 320 acres for grazing. You just studied 6 terms!</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-dawes-act-allow-the-president-to-do>What did the Dawes Act allow the president to do?</h2>
<p>What was the Dawes Act? The Dawes Act (sometimes called the Dawes Severalty Act or General Allotment Act), passed in 1887 under President Grover Cleveland, allowed the federal government to break up tribal lands. Only the Native Americans who accepted the division of tribal lands were allowed to become US citizens.</p>
<h2 id=how-could-the-federal-government-have-made-the-dawes-act-more-successful>How could the federal government have made the Dawes Act more successful?</h2>
<p>The federal government could have made the Dawes Act more successful by making it illegal for Native Americans to sell their land to speculators. Hope this answers the question.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-dawes-act>What was the purpose of the Dawes Act?</h2>
<p>What is assimilation? What was the Dawes Act? The Dawes Act (sometimes called the Dawes Severalty Act or General Allotment Act), passed in 1887 under President Grover Cleveland, allowed the federal government to break up tribal lands.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-registration-in-the-dawes-rolls-important>Why was registration in the Dawes Rolls important?</h2>
<p>Registration in the national registry known as the Dawes Rolls has come to be critical in issues of Indian citizenship and land claims. Although many Indian tribes did not consider strict ‘blood’ descent the only way to determine if a person was a member of a tribe, the Dawes Commission did.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-chairman-of-the-dawes-commission>Who was the first chairman of the Dawes Commission?</h2>
<p>Dawes Commission. The American Dawes Commission, named for its first chairman Henry L. Dawes, was authorized under a rider to an Indian Office appropriation bill, March 3, 1893.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-acres-would-an-orphan-get-under-the-dawes-act>How many acres would an orphan get under the Dawes Act?</h2>
<p>A head of family would receive a grant of 160 acres (65 ha), a single person or orphan over 18 years of age would receive a grant of 80 acres (32 ha), and persons under the age of 18 would receive 40 acres (16 ha) each; the allotments would be held in trust by the U.S. Government for 25 years;</p>
