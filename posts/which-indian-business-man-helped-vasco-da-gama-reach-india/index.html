<h2 id=which-indian-business-man-helped-vasco-da-gama-reach-india>Which Indian business man helped Vasco da Gama reach India?</h2>
<p>The consensus by various scholars seem to be that the man who really showed Vasco da Gama the way to India by sea was Kanji Malam.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-on-vasco-da-gamas-first-voyage>What happened on Vasco da Gama’s first voyage?</h2>
<p>During Vasco da Gama’s first voyage, he carried padrões (stone pillars) as marks of discovery. He erected one on an island near Mossel Bay, South Africa, two in Mozambique, and one in Calicut, India, to prove that his fleet—two three-masted sailing ships, a 50-ton caravel, and a 200-ton storeship—had been there.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-on-vasco-da-gamas-second-voyage>What happened on Vasco da Gama’s second voyage?</h2>
<p>The second voyage of Vasco da Gama. To exploit da Gama’s achievement, Manuel I dispatched the Portuguese navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral to Calicut with a fleet of 13 ships. After seizing the cargo, da Gama is said to have shut up the passengers aboard the captured ship and set it afire, killing all on board.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-paying-for-vasco-da-gamas-first-voyage>Who was paying for Vasco da Gama’s first voyage?</h2>
<p>Vasco da Gama’s first voyage was paid for and outfitted by the royal Portuguese treasury under King Manuel I.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-francisco-da-gama-do-for-portugal>What did Francisco da Gama do for Portugal?</h2>
<p>When Da Gama arrived at Lisbon about three weeks later, the Portuguese gave him a hero’s welcome. The king awarded him the grand title, ‘Lord of the Conquest, Navigation and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia and India’, and ‘Admiral of the Indian Sea’, with the rank of Dom, and many other rewards.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-vasco-da-gama-return-to-cannanore>When did Vasco da Gama return to Cannanore?</h2>
<p>On February 20, 1503, the fleet left Cannanore for Mozambique on the first stage of their return voyage, reaching the Tagus on October 11. Obscurity surrounds the reception of da Gama on his return by King Manuel. Da Gama seemingly felt himself inadequately recompensed for his pains.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-pedro-alvares-cabral-do-with-vasco-da-gama>What did Pedro Alvares Cabral do with Vasco da Gama?</h2>
<p>A much larger fleet, commanded by Pedro Alvares Cabral, was dispatched to capitalize on da Gama’s discoveries and secure a trading post at Calicut. After Muslim traders killed 50 of his men, Cabral retaliated by burning 10 Muslim cargo vessels and killing the nearly 600 sailors aboard.</p>
