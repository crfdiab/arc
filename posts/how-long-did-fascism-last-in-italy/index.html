<h2 id=how-long-did-fascism-last-in-italy>How long did fascism last in Italy?</h2>
<p>The ideology is associated with a series of two political parties led by Benito Mussolini: the National Fascist Party (PNF), which ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1922 until 1943, and the Republican Fascist Party that ruled the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-fascism-start-and-end>When did fascism start and end?</h2>
<p>The ideology is associated with the Fascist Revolutionary Party (PFR), founded in 1915; the succeeding National Fascist Party (PNF) in 1921, which under Benito Mussolini ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1922 until 1943; the Republican Fascist Party that ruled the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945; and the post- …</p>

<p>Marshal Pietro Badoglio<br>
ALTHOUGH the Italians rejoiced at the overthrow of Benito Mussolini in July 1943, and the surrender by his successor, Marshal Pietro Badoglio, to the Allies 45 days later, elation soon turned to anguish in what Richard Lamb notes is “the tragic story of modern Italy in her saddest hour.” Italy was treated brutally by …</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-fascist-regime-fall-in-italy>When did the Fascist regime fall in Italy?</h2>
<p>The fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, also known in Italy as 25 Luglio ( Venticinque Luglio, pronounced [ˌventiˈtʃiŋkwe ˈluʎʎo]; Italian for “25 July”), came as a result of parallel plots led respectively by Count Dino Grandi and King Victor Emmanuel III during the spring and summer of 1943,…</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-fight-against-fascism-end-in-america>When did the fight against fascism end in America?</h2>
<p>The fight ceased only when all the opposition leaders had been imprisoned, exiled, or murdered, when the physical instruments of opposition had been destroyed—the printing presses, the trade unions and their offices, the cooperatives, and so on.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-antifascism-start-to-gain-strength-in-italy>When did antifascism start to gain strength in Italy?</h2>
<p>During the period between 1936 and 1943 the lines were drawn more sharply between fascism and antifascism. As the depth of the disaster into which fascism had led Italy became clearer, more people joined the ranks of opposition. The underground movements gained in strength even if they never became overwhelming in numbers.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-three-years-of-fascism>What was the first three years of fascism?</h2>
<p>All the other elements of fascism were there, however: belief in violence, disbelief in legal processes, rabid nationalism, and so on. But the regime was not totalitarian in its first three years. Opposition parties were still legal, a strong opposition press operated under difficulties, and Mussolini kept talking about a return to normalcy.</p>
