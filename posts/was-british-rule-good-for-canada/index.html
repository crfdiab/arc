<h2 id=was-british-rule-good-for-canada>Was British rule good for Canada?</h2>
<p>An age of British rule Now England controlled all of Canada. In the years that followed, Canadian colonies—now under British rule—expanded their trade networks and built an economy largely supported by agriculture and the export of natural resources like fur and timber.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-canada-and-britain>What is the relationship between Canada and Britain?</h2>
<p>Canada and the UK share a sovereign, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and are among the oldest parliamentary democracies in the world. The relationship between our two countries continues a long tradition of strategic partnership.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-positive-and-negative-impact-british-rule>What was the positive and negative impact British rule?</h2>
<p>What was the positive and negative impact British rule? 2-they opened many industries,workers from different caste and race worked here, this increased unity among the people. 1-they extracted money from many kingdoms. there cruelty. Political and administrative unity. Uniform laws. Modern press, railways, post. Modern education and ideals.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-general-negatives-for-canada-being-part-of>What was the general negatives for Canada being part of?</h2>
<p>It seems to me that probably the biggest negative would be the difficulty of forming a truly cohesive nation with a singular identity and culture.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-canada-change-during-the-british-rule>How did Canada change during the British rule?</h2>
<p>During the acquisition of Canada under the British rule, St. Lawrence and Great Lakes region are considered as the most populous sites in the country. There were several events occurred which affected the British rule in North America. They include the War of 1812, Rebellions of 1837 and American Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-british-empire-a-good-or-a-bad-thing>Is the British Empire a good or a bad thing?</h2>
<p>Slavery was another negative because despite the enormous profits made, the suffering of the slaves was terrible. But on a positive note, it was the British themselves who abolished slavery in the eighteen hundreds. There were other empires of course, France, Portugal and Germany had their own, so the British Empire was not the only one.</p>
