<p>Denmark<br>
Danish is spoken by about 6 million people around the world. Most live in Denmark, but Danish is also an official language in Greenland and the Faroe Islands – both autonomous constituent countries under the Kingdom of Denmark – as well as in the northern parts of neighbouring Germany, where Danish has minority status.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-danish-an-official-language>Where is Danish an official language?</h2>
<p>Denmark has one official language: Danish. However, there are several minority languages spoken throughout the territory, if you include The Faeroe Islands and Greenland. Danes are taught English from a very young age and 86% of all Danes speak English as a second language.</p>
<h2 id=is-danish-a-hard-language>Is Danish a hard language?</h2>
<p>According to The Foreign Service Institute, the Danish language is a “category 1” in terms of the amount of time needed to learn it. It is not generally harder than languages like German, French or English. The perception of difficulty depends on a particular linguistic background and a person’s first language.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-people-in-denmark-speak-the-danish-language>Where do people in Denmark speak the Danish language?</h2>
<p>These are mostly places where the Kingdom of Denmark has strong historical ties, like old territories of Denmark, neighboring countries or even colonies. Danish is spoken in Denmark by some 5.8 million people. In Greenland, children learn Danish in school, and Danish is widely used as a second language by the 56.000 people who live there.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-in-greenland-speak-the-danish-language>How many people in Greenland speak the Danish language?</h2>
<p>Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas, around 15–20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their first language . Along with the other North Germanic languages, Danish is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples who lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-danish-language-spoken-in-the-faroe-islands>Is the Danish language spoken in the Faroe Islands?</h2>
<p>Danish is an official language in the Faroe Islands alongside Faroese and it’s spoken by around 50.000 people as a second language. Around 3.1% of the Faroese population speak Danish as their first language.

<h2 id=what-kind-of-syntax-does-the-danish-language-have>What kind of syntax does the Danish language have?</h2>
<p>Its syntax is V2 word order, with the finite verb always occupying the second slot in the sentence. Danish and its historical relationships to other North Germanic languages within the Germanic branch of Indo-European. Another classification can be drawn based on mutual intellegibility. Danish is a Germanic language of the North Germanic branch.</p>
