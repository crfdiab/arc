<h2 id=what-trestle-means>What trestle means?</h2>
<p>1 : a braced frame serving as a support. 2 : horse sense 2b. 3 : a braced framework of timbers, piles, or steelwork for carrying a road or railroad over a depression.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-bridge-and-a-trestle>What is the difference between a bridge and a trestle?</h2>
<p>Bridge: a structure spanning and providing passage over a river, chasm, road, or the like. A bridge is made of these trestles. A bridge is a connection between two points, without contact with the ground, in between. A trestle is a horizontal support for other structures.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-tufty-mean>What does Tufty mean?</h2>
<p>1. A short cluster of elongated strands, as of yarn, hair, or grass, attached at the base or growing close together. 2. A dense clump, especially of trees or bushes. v.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-trestle-used-for>What is a trestle used for?</h2>
<p>Trestle supports are used for work on a large area if little or no adjustment of height is required (e.g., for plastering the ceiling of a room). The trestles may be of special design or simply wooden sawhorses of the type used by carpenters.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-trestle-ladder>What is trestle ladder?</h2>
<p>The Trestle Ladder, also known as a Double Front Ladder, is a self-supporting portable ladder that is non-adjustable in length, and hinged at the top. It consists of two sections and is designed to be climbed by two persons at the same time, one on each side.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-gnarled-mean-in-english>What does gnarled mean in English?</h2>
<p>1 : full of knots or gnarls : knotty gnarled hands gnarled olive trees. 2 : crabbed in disposition, aspect, or character a gnarled old veteran.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-a-viaduct>Why is it called a viaduct?</h2>
<p>The term viaduct is derived from the Latin via meaning “road”, and ducere meaning “to lead”. It is a 19th-century derivation from an analogy with ancient Roman aqueducts. Like the Roman aqueducts, many early viaducts comprised a series of arches of roughly equal length.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-a-viaduct-not-a-bridge>Why is a viaduct not a bridge?</h2>
<p>All viaducts are bridges, and yet not all bridges are viaducts. Unlike more complex and diversified construction of bridges, viaducts consist of the main carrying surface which is supported by arches of equal spans mostly built of stone or concrete. Bridges, on the other hand, are usually built over bodies of water.</p>

After the ends of the ledgers and the cross braces are lashed to the legs, stand the trestle up on end. Are trestle tables sturdy?</h2>
<p>Because the trestle and stretcher are so sturdy, this table can last many lifetimes over. This is a very durable table style. Usually costing a little more than a leg table, trestle tables require less wood and weigh less than many pedestal tables, so they are a viable option for most Amish furniture buyers.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-definition-of-a-trestle>Which is the best definition of a trestle?</h2>
<p>a frame typically composed of a horizontal bar or beam rigidly joined or fitted at each end to the top of a transverse A-frame, used as a barrier, a transverse support for planking, etc.; horse. Civil Engineering. one of a number of bents, having sloping sides of framework or piling, for supporting the deck or stringers of a bridge.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-bent-and-bent-trestle>What’s the difference between a bent and bent trestle?</h2>
<p>In the context of trestle bridges, each supporting frame is generally referred to as a bent. Timber and iron trestles were extensively used in the 19th century, the former making up from 1 to 3% of the total length of the average railroad.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-portmanteau-put-on-the-trestle>Where was the portmanteau put on the trestle?</h2>
<p>There was his portmanteau on its trestle, exactly where he had seen the porter put it when he first arrived. The two boys gazed respectfully at the bare trestle table and the raised reading-desk and the picture of St. Benedict. Both boys narrowly missed being run down by an ore train as it was shunted out on the trestle.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-timber-trestle-bridge>What was the purpose of the timber trestle bridge?</h2>
<p>Timber trestles were used to get the railroad to its destination. Once the railroad was running, it was used to transport the material to replace trestles with more permanent works, transporting and dumping fill around some trestles and transporting stone or steel to replace others with more permanent bridges.</p>
