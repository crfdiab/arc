<h2 id=which-type-of-breast-implant-feels-the-most-natural>Which type of breast implant feels the most natural?</h2>

<h2 id=do-breast-implants-feel-different-to-touch-to-a-man>Do breast implants feel different to touch to a man?</h2>
<p>This is particularly true of the form stable (“gummy bear”) breast implant, which is filled with a cohesive gel that mimics the feel of natural breast tissue almost perfectly. However, different types of breast implants can all feel natural to the touch when the correct procedural steps are taken.</p>
<h2 id=do-your-nipples-get-bigger-when-you-get-breast-implants>Do your nipples get bigger when you get breast implants?</h2>
<p>Some women mistakenly believe that as the breasts get bigger, the areolas (the pigmented skin surrounding the nipples) grow in proportion. However, in most cases, the areolas do not dramatically change in size after breast augmentation.</p>
<h2 id=does-sleeping-on-stomach-increase-breast-size>Does sleeping on stomach increase breast size?</h2>
<p>Sleeping on your side or stomach. “However, it’s important to note that sleeping on your stomach—with your chest pressed against the mattress for hours—is tough on your breasts,” notes Dr. Miller. And let’s not forget the effects of side sleeping as well, this can cause your breast ligaments to stretch over time.</p>
<h2 id=what-implants-look-the-most-natural>What implants look the most natural?</h2>
<p>Implant Material Among the options available today—which include saline and various kinds of silicone—silicone implants tend to produce the most natural-looking and natural-feeling breasts. Silicone implants are slightly more costly than saline, but because they’re made from a highly viscous gel, they’re much softer.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-better-round-or-teardrop-implants>What is better round or teardrop implants?</h2>
<p>Most patients will benefit more from a round breast implant, particularly if their main consideration is to augment the size of the breast and give it more of a lift. Teardrop implants are riskier, more expensive, and may need to be fixed later on.</p>

<h2 id=how-much-does-a-silicone-breast-implant-cost>How much does a silicone breast implant cost?</h2>
<p>Silicone implants can cost $1,800 and up to $2,500 and in some situations ca even go over the $3,000 mark. On the other hand, saline implants are cheaper and will cost anywhere from $1,200 to $1,600. The cost of the implants will be dependant on the size, quality and manufacturer, although the difference won`t be a big one.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-incision-for-breast-augmentation-made>Where is the incision for breast augmentation made?</h2>
<p>The surgeon will make an incision either around the nipple, in the breast crease or under the armpit and will then lift breast tissue and skin to create a pocket in which to insert the implant, either behind the breast tissue or behind the chest muscle. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons [ 1] gives an overview of the procedure.</p>
