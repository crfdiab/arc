<h2 id=what-issues-did-juan-ponce-de-leon-face>What issues did Juan Ponce de Leon face?</h2>
<p>Ponce de Leon by: Dani. Challenges Faced. Some challenges he faced were Native Inhabitants, Native Americans, the long voyages and the Muslims he fought in a war when he was in his teens. He also faced the Caribbean Indians, storms, sailing, and finding food and water.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-ponce-de-leon-do-with-his-wealth>What did Ponce de Leon do with his wealth?</h2>
<p>In 1505, Ponce de León received permission to found a new town in Higüey: Salvaleón. There, his large stone house still stands to this day. Even with his prosperous estate, Juan Ponce de León still wanted to increase his wealth further. And, like many Spanish explorers, there was one shiny thing on his mind: gold.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-juan-ponce-de-leon-when-he-died>How old was Juan Ponce de Leon when he died?</h2>
<p>Juan Ponce De León is a very well known explorer. He is known for discovering Florida and for setting up the first European colonies in Puerto Rico. Juan Ponce De León was born in Spain in 1460, that was quite a long time ago. He died in 1521, he was 61 when he died.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-ponce-de-leon-settle-in-hispaniola>Where did Ponce de Leon settle in Hispaniola?</h2>
<p>This voyage would be the start of Ponce de León’s long (and brutal) career as an explorer. Sometime after his 1493 trip to the New World, Juan Ponce de León settled in Hispaniola — the Spanish colony in the Caribbean which now comprises Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</p>

<h2 id=what-did-ponce-de-leon-do-as-a-young-man>What did Ponce de Leon do as a young man?</h2>
<p>Then, as a young man, Ponce de León enlisted in the Spanish army during the final years of the Reconquista — Spain’s push to “reconquer” the Iberian peninsula by expelling the Moors living in the south. Ponce de León fought in the battle against the Emirate of Granada, the final Muslim stronghold in Spain.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-ponce-de-leon-join-the-second-expedition>Why did Ponce de Leon join the second expedition?</h2>
<p>The Moors were expelled from the country for good. While Juan Ponce de León no doubt celebrated this nationalist victory, he was also aware that his country no longer needed his military services. So, per History, he likely joined Christopher Columbus’ second expedition to the New World in 1493.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-ponce-de-leon-end-the-tainos-rebellion>How did Ponce de Leon end the Tainos rebellion?</h2>
<p>Casualties quickly piled up on both sides. The Taínos attacked Spaniards with arrows and burned down their settlements, while the Spanish retaliated with swords and gunfire. Ponce de León hoped to bring a swift end to the rebellion and mobilized a force of about 120 men.</p>

<h2 id=why-did-juan-ponce-de-leon-go-to-florida>Why did Juan Ponce de Leon go to Florida?</h2>
<p>Juan Ponce de León. A decade later, he was serving as governor of the eastern province of Hispaniola when he decided to explore a nearby island, which became Puerto Rico. In pursuit of a rumored fountain of youth located on an island known as Bimini, Ponce de León led an expedition to the coast of what is now Florida in 1513.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-children-did-juan-ponce-de-leon-have>How many children did Juan Ponce de Leon have?</h2>
<p>They had three daughters (Juana, Isabel and Maria) and one son (Luis). The large stone house Ponce de León ordered built for his growing family still stands today near the city of Salvaleón de Higüey. As provincial governor, Ponce de León had occasion to meet with the Taínos who visited his province from neighboring Puerto Rico.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-ponce-de-leon-do-in-the-higuey-massacre>What did Ponce de Leon do in the Higuey massacre?</h2>
<p>Ponce de León was actively involved in the Higüey massacre, about which friar Bartolomé de las Casas attempted to notify Spanish authorities. Ovando rewarded his victorious commander by appointing him frontier governor of the newly conquered province, then named Higüey also.</p>

<h2 id=where-was-juan-ponce-de-leon-laid-to-rest>Where was Juan Ponce de Leon laid to rest?</h2>
<p>Juan Ponce de León died in Cuba, but his remains were later transferred to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where they were put to rest in San Juan Cathedral. Puerto Rico’s third-largest city, Ponce, bears the explorer’s name.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-juan-ponce-de-leon-start-exploring-puerto-rico>When did Juan Ponce de Leon start exploring Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>From 1508-1509, he explored the island, and founded the oldest settlement of Caparra near San Juan. In 1510, the Spanish king made Ponce de Leon governor of Puerto Rico. But he was replaced by Diego Columbus in 1511. 6 When Christopher Columbus found the land, he was given rights to rule.</p>

<h2 id=what-did-ponce-de-leon-do-in-higuey>What did Ponce de Leon do in Higuey?</h2>
<p>Ponce de León prospered in this new role. He found a ready market for his farm produce and livestock at nearby Boca de Yuma where Spanish ships made a final call for supplies before the long voyage back to Spain. In 1505 he was authorized by Ovando to establish a new town in Higüey, which he named Salvaleón.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-juan-ponce-de-leon-die-from-an-arrow>How did Juan Ponce de Leon die from an arrow?</h2>
<p>The exact circumstances of what happened next are uncertain, but it appears that in early July local Indians attacked the party of settlers, leaving Ponce de León fatally wounded by an arrow in his thigh. His comrades sailed back with him to Havana, Cuba, where he died.</p>

<h2 id=where-did-juan-ponce-de-leon-go-on-his-voyage>Where did Juan Ponce de Leon go on his voyage?</h2>
<p>Ponce de León in Florida Born into Spanish nobility, Juan Ponce de León (1460-1521) may have accompanied Christopher Columbus on his 1493 voyage to the Americas. A decade later, he was serving as governor of the eastern province of Hispaniola when he decided to explore a nearby island, which became Puerto Rico.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-florida-named-after-ponce-de-leon>Why was Florida named after Ponce de Leon?</h2>
<p>Ponce de León in Florida. He named the site Florida, not only because they landed around the time of Easter (Pascua Florida in Spanish), but also in honor of the region’s lush and florid vegetation. On that first expedition to Florida, Ponce de León explored the coast, including the Florida Keys, and discovered the Gulf Stream,…</p>

<h2 id=where-did-juan-ponce-de-leon-set-up-his-settlement>Where did Juan Ponce de Leon set up his settlement?</h2>
<p>After an absence of eight years, he returned to Florida to establish a settlement and made landfall in today’s Charlotte Harbor, Florida. From early on, Ponce de León already faced challenges in his career, whether as a soldier, explorer, or governor for Spain and its colonies.</p>
<p>Not long after his arrival he had a fatal encounter with the natives. During an attack by the natives, Ponce de Leon was shot and wounded by an arrow. The Spaniards retreated to Havana, Cuba. In July 1521, a few days after the incident, in Havana, Juan Ponce de Leon died from his wounds.</p>
<p>A year later in September 1493, Ponce de Leon went on Christopher Columbus’ second voyage to the New World.2 He settled on the island of Hispaniola (modern day Dominican Republic and Haiti). In 1502, he married a Spanish woman named Leonor, and they had four children. He had three daughters – Juana, Isabel, and Maria; and a son named Luis.3</p>
