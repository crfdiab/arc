<h2 id=what-was-one-way-that-the-virginia-plan>What was one way that the Virginia Plan?</h2>
<p>Introduced to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, James Madison’s Virginia Plan outlined a strong national government with three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The plan called for a legislature divided into two bodies (the Senate and the House of Representatives) with proportional representation.</p>

<p>The Virginia plan divided power among 3 branches,legislative, executive, judicial. The plan proposed a bicameral legislature in which states with larger populations would have more delegates than states with fewer residents.. the congress would have the power to veto state laws. There was a strong president.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-difference-between-the-virginia-and-new-jersey-plans>What was the difference between the Virginia and New Jersey plans?</h2>
<p>In contrast to the Virginia Plan, the New Jersey Plan proposed a unicameral legislature with one vote per state. Inherited from the Articles of Confederation, this position reflected the belief that the states were independent entities. To resolve this stalemate, the Connecticut Compromise blended the Virginia and New Jersey proposals.</p>

<p>So, in response to James Madison’s draft, William Patterson gathered support from smaller states for a new proposal, which was eventually called the New Jersey Plan, named after Patterson’s home state. It called for a single chamber of Congress in which each state had one vote, similar to the system in place under the Articles of Confederation.</p>

<p>After the Virginia Plan was introduced, New Jersey delegate William Paterson asked for an adjournment to contemplate the plan. Under the Articles of Confederation, each state had equal representation in Congress, exercising one vote each. Paterson’s New Jersey Plan was ultimately a rebuttal to the Virginia Plan.</p>
