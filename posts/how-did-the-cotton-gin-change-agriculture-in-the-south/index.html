<h2 id=how-did-the-cotton-gin-change-agriculture-in-the-south>How did the cotton gin change agriculture in the South?</h2>
<p>The invention of the cotton gin made the South a one-crop economy and increased the need for slave labor. The invention of the cotton gin revived the economy of the South. The cotton gin created a cotton boom in which farmers grew little else. Some people encouraged southerners to focus on other crops and industries.</p>
<h2 id=which-invention-by-eli-whitney-dramatically-change-agriculture-in-the-south>Which invention by eli whitney dramatically change agriculture in the South?</h2>
<p>In 1794, U.S.-born inventor Eli Whitney (1765-1825) patented the cotton gin, a machine that revolutionized the production of cotton by greatly speeding up the process of removing seeds from cotton fiber. By the mid-19th century, cotton had become America’s leading export.</p>
<h2 id=what-invention-removed-a-major-obstacle-to-the-westward-spread-of-cotton-cultivation>What invention removed a major obstacle to the westward spread of cotton cultivation?</h2>
<p>Because these new machines ran on water- power, most mills were built near rivers. In 1785, for the first time, a steam engine provided power for a cotton mill. In 1793 Eli Whitney of Massachusetts invented the cotton gin, a simple machine that quickly and efficiently removed the seeds from the cotton fiber.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-cotton-gin-cause-an-increase-in-the-demand-for-slaves>How did the cotton gin cause an increase in the demand for slaves?</h2>
<p>While it was true that the cotton gin reduced the labor of removing seeds, it did not reduce the need for slaves to grow and pick the cotton. Cotton growing became so profitable for the planters that it greatly increased their demand for both land and slave labor.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-cotton-gin-bad-for-slaves>Why was the cotton gin bad for slaves?</h2>
<p>While it was true that the cotton gin reduced the labor of removing seeds, it did not reduce the need for slaves to grow and pick the cotton. In fact, the opposite occurred. Cotton growing became so profitable for the planters that it greatly increased their demand for both land and slave labor.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-route-for-the-settlers-to-the-west>What was the main route for the settlers to the west?</h2>
<p>But when the Erie Canal opened in 1825, it was considered a marvel. The canal connected the Hudson River, and New York City, with the Great Lakes. As a simple route into the interior of North America, it carried thousands of settlers westward in the first half of the 19th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-popular-route-to-the-west-in-the-1800s>What was the most popular route to the west in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>In the early decades of the 1800s, that all began to change as very well-traveled routes were followed by many thousands of settlers. The Wilderness Road was a path westward to Kentucky established by Daniel Boone and followed by thousands of settlers in the late 1700s and early 1800s.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-road-to-the-west-built>Where was the first road to the west built?</h2>
<p>A land route westward was needed in the early 1800s, a fact made evident when Ohio became a state and there was no road that went there. And so the National Road was proposed as the first federal highway. Construction began in western Maryland in 1811.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-route-used-by-the-frontiersmen>What was the route used by the frontiersmen?</h2>
<p>At its beginning, in the early 1770s, it was a road in name only. Boone and the frontiersmen he supervised managed to link together a route comprising old Native American pathways and trails used for centuries by herds of buffalo. Over time, it was improved and widened to accommodate the wagons and travelers.</p>
