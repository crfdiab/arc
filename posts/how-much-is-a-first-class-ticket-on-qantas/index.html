<h2 id=how-much-is-a-first-class-ticket-on-qantas>How much is a first class ticket on Qantas?</h2>
<p>Ticket prices range between around $4,500 up to $7,000 or more for a return Qantas first class journey on this route.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-first-class-international-flight>How much is a first class international flight?</h2>
<p>How much does an international first class ticket cost? First class tickets can cost upwards of $5,000 internationally. On the very high end, an international first class ticket could cost tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-flying-first-class-so-expensive>Why is flying first class so expensive?</h2>
<p>First Class airline seats are expensive because they take up significant real-estate, and the airline senses a market opportunity. A First Class passenger is taking five times as much real estate as an Economy passenger. So, at the very least, our First Class seat should cost 5x the price of an Economy seat.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-dress-code-for-first-class-flights>Is there a dress code for first class flights?</h2>
<p>There is no published dress code for First Class passengers. The airlines don’t want to offend anyone by dictating how they dress. They just want their money. However, it makes a great deal of difference to the other passengers flying in First Class and to the Flight Attendants working your cabin.</p>
<h2 id=why-first-class-is-so-expensive>Why first-class is so expensive?</h2>
<h2 id=what-is-the-cheapest-first-class-airline>What is the cheapest first-class airline?</h2>
<p>Here are four airlines that offer the cheapest first and business class seats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spirit. This is an airline that everyone loves to hate due to its numerous fees and often questionable customer service, but bear with me.</li>
<li>La Compagnie.</li>
<li>Norwegian Air.</li>
<li>JetBlue.</li>
<li>Other tips for getting cheap first class.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id=what-do-you-wear-in-first-class>What do you wear in first class?</h2>
<p>Men traveling in first or business class must wear collared shirts and long pants or jeans, while women must wear business-appropriate long or short-sleeve blouses, skirts, slack or jeans, or dresses.</p>

<h2 id=how-long-is-the-flight-from-london-to-sydney>How long is the flight from London to Sydney?</h2>

A number of travel classes are available for your flight, making it easy to select the onboard experience that best suits you. On your way from London to Sydney, you’ll have a short stopover in Melbourne, Perth or Singapore.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-economy-and-first-class-in-sydney>What’s the difference between economy and first class in Sydney?</h2>
<p>Rest assured flying in First class means you have full access to some of the best airport lounges in the world allowing you time to refresh and ready for your onward flight. You may not require a bed on your flights to Sydney but may prefer an enhanced cabin with a greater degree of comfort then normal economy class.</p>
