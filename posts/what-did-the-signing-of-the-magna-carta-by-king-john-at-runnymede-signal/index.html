<p>The Magna Carta<br>
Hear this out loudPauseThe Magna Carta was signed by King John in June 1215 and was the first document to impose legal limits on the king’s personal powers.

<p>Runnymede is thought to take its name from “runieg” meaning regular meeting, and “mead” meaning meadow. “The confusing thing is Americans come over and they think ‘Where is this place called Runnymede?’ and actually it’s not a town,” she says.</p>

<p>In 1215, the barons rose up in rebellion against the king’s abuse of feudal law and custom. John, faced with a superior force, had no choice but to give in to their demands.</p>
