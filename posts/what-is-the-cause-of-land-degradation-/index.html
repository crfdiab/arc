<h2 id=what-is-the-cause-of-land-degradation->What is the cause of land degradation *?</h2>
<p>Taking the form of desertification, deforestation, overgrazing, salinization, or soil erosion, land degradation can be caused by biophysical factors, such as the natural topography of an area or its rainfall, wind, and temperature; and unsustainable land management practices, such as deforestation, soil nutrient mining …</p>
<h2 id=why-is-deforestation-a-problem-in-indonesia>Why is deforestation a problem in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>Large areas of forest in Indonesia have been cleared by large multinational pulp companies, such as Asia Pulp and Paper, and replaced by plantations. Forests are often burned by farmers and plantation owners. Another major source of deforestation is the logging industry, driven by demand from China and Japan.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-degradation-of-land>What is meant by degradation of land?</h2>
<p>Land degradation is the reduction or loss of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of rain—fed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest or woodlands resulting from natural processes, land uses or other human activities and habitation patterns such as land contamination, soil erosion and …</p>
<h2 id=what-can-we-do-to-stop-deforestation-in-indonesia>What can we do to stop deforestation in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>One option to prevent further losses is to include degraded forests controlled by local indigenous people in social forestry projects. These projects can benefit local livelihoods, ensure that non-timber forest products are managed sustainably, and help to safeguard degraded forests.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-of-land-degradation-in-indonesia>What are the causes of land degradation in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>Degraded land in Indonesia was 24.3 million ha in 2013 (MoF). It was caused mainly by inappropriate land use, no soil and water conservation measures applied in such areas entailed to severe erosion, sedimentation and degradation of water condition (quantity and quality) in the downstream area.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-indigenous-people-affected-by-deforestation-in-indonesia>How are indigenous people affected by deforestation in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>Some indigenous people like in Dayaks and Anak Dalam in Indonesia, still have nomad cultures, where they will move from one land to another and do simple farming to sustain their life. When moving to a new land, they will do deforestation by cutting or burning trees and grow their crops in the land.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-one-of-the-main-causes-of-land-degradation>Which is one of the main causes of land degradation?</h2>
<p>Problem soils require special care in management, and failure to give such care leads to land degradation. Deforestation of unsuitable land Deforestation is both a type of degradation as such, and also a cause of other types, principally water erosion.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-soil-shortage-lead-to-land-degradation>How does soil shortage lead to land degradation?</h2>
<p>Percentages of land covered by problem soils are given in Dent (1990). With respect to land degradation, the key feature is that land shortage in the region has led to the widespread agricultural use of areas with natural hazards. These are the passive, or predisposing, conditions for land degradation.</p>
