<h2 id=why-did-europeans-explore-north-carolina>Why did Europeans explore North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Their initial motivation was primarily economic: after the “discovery” of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492, several navigators followed in his wake searching for the riches of the Orient.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-early-explorers-find-in-nc>What did the early explorers find in NC?</h2>
<p>Europeans Arrive The first Europeans to arrive in North Carolina were the Spanish. First, explorer Giovanni da Verrazano mapped out the coastline in 1524. Later explorers included Juan Pardo, who founded Fort San Juan in western North Carolina in 1567, and Hernando de Soto, who came searching for gold.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-spanish-eventually-give-up-exploring-north-carolina>Why did the Spanish eventually give up exploring North Carolina?</h2>
<p>The Spanish decided to abandon the forts and return to Saint Augustine (in present-day Florida). Thus, King Philip II’s dream of a road to Zacatecas and a northern colony to protect his silver mines in Mexico came to an end. Spain did not make another attempt to colonize North Carolina.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-explore-north-carolina>Who was the first person to explore North Carolina?</h2>
<p>In 1524, Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed along the coast of present-day North Carolina and established a French claim to the area.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-settlement-in-north-carolina>Where was the first settlement in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>The first permanent European settlement in northern Carolina was established in the Albemarle Sound region by Virginians, around 1653.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-spain-want-to-colonize-north-carolina>Why did Spain want to colonize North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Spain had been concerned for some time that England established settlements in North America yet had made little effort to prevent the English from doing so. After 1588, a weaker Spain had not the resources to respond to English settlement, and with little resistance from European powers, England claimed North Carolina.</p>
