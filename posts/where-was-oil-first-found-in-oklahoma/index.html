<h2 id=what-was-the-first-major-oil-discovery>What was the first major oil discovery?</h2>
<p>The first modern oil well in America was drilled by Edwin Drake in Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1859. The discovery of petroleum in Titusville led to the Pennsylvania ‘oil rush’, making oil one of the most valuable commodities in America.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-oil-get-discovered-in-oklahoma>How did oil get discovered in Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>Discovery of oil led to extreme exploration and human encroachment in Oklahoma as well as increased wealth. Now, there are jobs that include finding oil, drilling oil, selling oil, and getting rid of wastes that are produced during the oil refinery process.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-oil-drilling-start-in-oklahoma>When did oil drilling start in Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>1889<br>
Oklahoma City’s first oil well was drilled in 1889 shortly after the run; the driller, however, was looking for water and abandoned the well. The Foster Petroleum Company and ITIO brought in the Oklahoma City Number One as a gusher on December 4, 1928.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-oklahoma-rank-in-oil-production>Where does Oklahoma rank in oil production?</h2>

<h2 id=who-drilled-the-first-oil-well-in-oklahoma>Who drilled the first oil well in Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>Dr. H.W. Faucett<br>
It was drilled by Dr. H.W. Faucett, who started work in 1885 on Choctaw land for the Choctaw Oil and Refining Company, but the 1,414-foot (431 m) well was not completed until 1888.</p>

<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-oil-field-in-oklahoma>Which is the largest oil field in Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>It has the most wells and the biggest oil and gas production numbers. The Wilcox has been the largest producing oil reservoir in the Oklahoma City Field while the Bartlesville has produced the most natural gas with the Oswego a close second.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-geology-is-found-in-oklahoma>What kind of geology is found in Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>The sedimentary basins that have yielded the bulk of Oklahoma’s oil produc- tion are mostly Pennsylvanian in age, but oil and gas reser- voirs across the State range from Cambrian to Cretaceous (Fig. 3). EARLY HISTORY Oil seeps were recognized in Oklahoma long before the arrival of European settlers, who mined some seeps for as- phalt.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-oil-industry-in-oklahoma>Who was the leader of the oil industry in Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>The following year Glenn Pool, one of the greatest oil fields ever, made Oklahoma a national leader in oil production and induced several major energy companies to tie the state into their major oil transmission pipelines. A decade earlier, on March 16, 1896, Henry Foster had leased the mineral rights to the entire Osage Nation for ten years.</p>
