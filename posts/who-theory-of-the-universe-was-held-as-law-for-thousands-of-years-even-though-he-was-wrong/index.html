<h2 id=who-theory-of-the-universe-was-held-as-law-for-thousands-of-years-even-though-he-was-wrong>Who theory of the universe was held as law for thousands of years even though he was wrong?</h2>
<p>The answer to this is Aristotle.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-aristotles-model-of-the-universe>What is Aristotle’s model of the universe?</h2>
<p>Aristotle’s model of the universe was also geocentric, with the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars all orbiting the Earth inside of Eudoxus’ spheres. Aristotle believed the universe is finite in space but exists eternally in time. A heliocentric universe depicted in 1660.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-owner-of-universe>Who is the owner of universe?</h2>
<p>On April 27, 4977 B.C., the universe is created, according to German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler, considered a founder of modern science. Kepler is best known for his theories explaining the motion of planets.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-models-of-the-universe>What are the 3 models of the universe?</h2>
<p>Three Models of the Universe: Flat, Open & Closed.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-accepted-model-of-the-universe>What is the most accepted model of the universe?</h2>
<p>ΛCDM Big Bang model<br>
What is the currently most accepted model for the Universe? The current best fit model is a flat ΛCDM Big Bang model where the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, and the age of the Universe is 13.7 billion years.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-ceo-of-the-universe>Who is the CEO of the universe?</h2>
<p>Joseph Cohen<br>
Joseph Cohen is the Founder & CEO at Universe . Additionally, Joseph Cohen has had 1 past job as the Co-founder and CEO at Lore .</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-different-theories-of-the-origin-of-the-universe>Why are there different theories of the origin of the universe?</h2>
<p>In other words, the cosmic inflation continues in some parts of the Universe and cease in the others. This leads to a multiverse scenario, wherein space is broken into bubbles. It’s like a universe inside a universe. In a multiverse, different universes may have different laws of nature, physics, at work.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-big-bang-theory-explain-the-universe>How does the Big Bang theory explain the universe?</h2>
<p>The Big Bang Theory is an explanation, based mostly on mathematical models, on how and when the Universe came into existence. The cosmological model of the Universe described in the Big Bang theory explains how it initially expanded from a state of infinite density and temperature, known as the primordial (or gravitational) singularity.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-albert-einstein-think-the-universe-was-everlasting>When did Albert Einstein think the universe was everlasting?</h2>
<p>The cyclic or oscillating model, wherein the Universe reiterates over and over in an indefinite cycle, first came into the spotlight in the 1930s, when Albert Einstein investigated the idea of an ‘everlasting’ universe.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-scientists-start-debating-the-origin-of-the-universe>When did scientists start debating the origin of the universe?</h2>
<p>But wait, there is more. In the late 1920s, scientist Georges Lemaître began working on the idea that if the universe is expanding (based on Hubble’s discovery) then it could be traced back to the time where it all started. Soon the entire scientific community was debating on the possible origin of the universe.</p>
