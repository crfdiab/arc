<p>When the great Gen. It cannot be overstated how much Washington did not want to be president. Years before, he had been so excited to be general at the beginning of the Revolutionary War that he showed up to the Second Continental Congress in uniform.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-washingtons-popularity>What was Washington’s popularity?</h2>
<p>George Washington still ranks as Americans’ number one president, according to a new poll out Friday. A whopping 89 percent of Americans say they see the United States’ first president favorably, according to a Public Policy Polling survey.</p>
<h2 id=why-washington-is-the-best-president>Why Washington is the best president?</h2>
<p>What made Washington a great leader was his understanding of what had to be done. As president, Washington realized that the new Constitution had to be made to work if democracy was to take root in American soil. This would not happen if he had chosen to become a lifetime king or if federal laws were ignored.</p>

George Washington/Presidential terms</p>

<p>The election is also the only race in American history which the victor initially won both fewer electoral votes and fewer popular votes than his opponent. Tilden won 184 electoral votes — one shy of the number needed to win — to Hayes’ 165 votes. However, the election was riddled with voter fraud and suppression in the post-Civil War south.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-have-become-president-without-being-elected-as-president>How many people have become president without being elected as president?</h2>
<p>A gray arrow points to the name of a person who became president without having been elected as president (9 total). The double arrow indicates becoming president without having been elected as vice president as well (Ford). 5 other former vice presidents are underlined (14 total).</p>

<p>Expert Answers. The Federalists used this to do things like closing down newspapers that supported the Republican (aka Democratic-Republican) Party. When the Federalists did this, it made people even more suspicious of them. It made people suspect that the Federalists would not support American, democratic, values in the long term.</p>
