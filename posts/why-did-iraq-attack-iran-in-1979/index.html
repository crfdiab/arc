<h2 id=why-did-iraq-attack-iran-in-1979>Why did Iraq attack Iran in 1979?</h2>
<p>The invasion’s purpose, per Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, was to blunt the edge of Iranian Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini’s movement and thwart his attempts to export Iran’s Islamic Revolution to Saddam’s secular Iraq and the Persian Gulf states.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-saddam-hussein-respond-to-the-shia-uprising>How did Saddam Hussein respond to the Shia uprising?</h2>
<p>On March 7, in an effort to quiet the uprisings, Saddam Hussein offered the Shia and Kurd leaders shares in the central government in exchange for loyalty, but the opposing groups rejected the proposal. At the height of the revolution, the government lost effective control over 14 of Iraq’s 18 provinces.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-saddam-do-to-the-marsh-arabs>What did Saddam do to the Marsh Arabs?</h2>
<p>They also provide a resting spot for thousands of wildfowl migrating between Siberia and Africa. Saddam Hussein, who accused the region’s Marsh Arab inhabitants of treachery during the 1980-1988 war with Iran, dammed and drained the marshes in the 1990s to flush out rebels hiding in the reeds.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-shia-uprising-in-1999>What was the name of the Shia uprising in 1999?</h2>
<p>Persian Gulf Wars. The 1999 Shia uprising in Iraq (or Second Sadr Uprising) refers to a short period of unrest in Iraq in early 1999 following the killing of Mohammad Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr by the then Ba’athist government of Iraq.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-saddam-crack-down-on-the-shiites-in-iraq>When did Saddam crack down on the Shi’ites in Iraq?</h2>
<p>Saddam began to crack down on the Shi’ite leadership in the late 1990s in an attempt to regain control of Iraq. Sometime before his death, al-Sadr was informed of Saddam’s limited patience with him.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-sciri-in-karbala>Who was the leader of SCIRI in Karbala?</h2>
<p>On 3 March Ammar al-Hakim, the leader of SCIRI, announced that it had attacked several government buildings in Karbala as part of the revenge operations for the killing of al-Sadr.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-an-uprising-in-iraq-in-1999>Why was there an uprising in Iraq in 1999?</h2>
<p>The Iraqi government however denied reports of widespread killing, and blamed the unrest on Iranian infiltrators. Following the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and the toppling of the Ba’athist government the suppression of the events of 1999 were investigated by the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal.</p>
