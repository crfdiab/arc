<h2 id=is-afghanistan-a-developed-or-developing-country>Is Afghanistan a developed or developing country?</h2>
<p>Despite holding over $1 trillion in proven untapped mineral deposits, Afghanistan remains one of the least developed countries in the world. Its unemployment rate is over 23% and about half of its population lives below the poverty line.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-has-conflict-had-on-afghanistans-development>What impact has conflict had on Afghanistan’s development?</h2>
<p>The war has exacerbated the effects of poverty, malnutrition, poor sanitation, lack of access to health care, and environmental degradation on Afghans’ health.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-america-withdraws-from-iraq-and-afghanistan>What happens if America withdraws from Iraq and Afghanistan?</h2>
<p>America’s withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan could also embolden other countries to increase their involvement in them, especially Pakistan in Afghanistan and Iran in Iraq (and possibly Afghanistan as well). A fourth consequence, ironically, may be that some of America’s allies in the region become less amenable to U.S. influence.</p>

<h2 id=why-did-the-united-states-go-to-afghanistan>Why did the United States go to Afghanistan?</h2>
<p>Al Qaeda, who did attacks against United States Uses Afghanistan as her base.In retaliation for the attack, the US invaded the country with the objective of dismantle the organization, remove the Taliban from the power and arrest all those involved in the attack.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-problems-in-iraq-or-afghanistan>Are there any problems in Iraq or Afghanistan?</h2>
<p>Of course, the presence of American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan has done nothing to ease them either. In other words, there are many problems in the region that are likely to continue no matter what happens in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
