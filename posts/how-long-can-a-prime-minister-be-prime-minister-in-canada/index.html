<h2 id=how-long-can-a-prime-minister-be-prime-minister-in-canada>How long can a prime minister be prime minister in Canada?</h2>
<p>Canadian prime ministers do not have a fixed term of office. Nor do they have term limits. Instead, they can stay in office as long as their government has the confidence of a majority in the House of Commons of Canada under the system of responsible government.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-harper-government-end>When did the Harper government end?</h2>
<p>“Canada’s New Government” and “Harper Government” From taking office in February 2006 until October 2007, the government was branded “Canada’s New Government” and from late-2010 to mid-2011 it was branded the “Harper Government”.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-only-welsh-born-prime-minister>Who is the only Welsh born prime minister?</h2>
<p>David Lloyd George was one of the 20th century’s most famous radicals. He was the first and only Welshman to hold the office of Prime Minister.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-current-prime-minister-of-canada>Who is the current Prime Minister of Canada?</h2>
<p>Canada’s prime minister, Stephen Harper, faces a widening revolt by the country’s leading scientists against sweeping cuts to government research labs and broadly pro-industry policies.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-prime-minister-of-canada-resign>When does the Prime Minister of Canada resign?</h2>
<p>Thus, although the outgoing prime minister formally resigns only hours before the incoming ministry swears their oaths, both during the day, the ministries are effectively changed at midnight the night before. Some sources, including the Parliament of Canada, apply this convention as far back as 1917.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-a-prime-minister-have-to-leave-office>When does a prime minister have to leave office?</h2>
<p>Under the Act, prime ministers’ tenures are therefore credited as having concluded at the end of their last full day in office (the earlier date given), although their resignation was received by the Governor General on the following day.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-prime-minister-of-canada-in-1980>Who was the Prime Minister of Canada in 1980?</h2>
<p>1980 Quebec referendum; Access to Information Act; Patriation of the Canadian Constitution; Montreal Protocol; Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; National Energy Program; Canada Health Act; Western alienation. Minister of Justice, Minister of Finance; Trudeau Patronage Appointments. Never sat in parliament as Prime Minister.</p>
