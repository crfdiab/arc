<h2 id=did-aboriginal-people-build-shelter>Did Aboriginal people build shelter?</h2>
<p>According to Paul Memmott, many of the huts and shelters Aboriginal people built were dome structures. In the rainforest area around Cairns, in Queensland, where there was heavy rain for much of the year, people would occupy such villages for up to a year.</p>
<h2 id=did-australian-aborigines-live-in-huts>Did Australian Aborigines live in huts?</h2>
<p>Before white settlers arrived, Australia’s indigenous peoples lived in houses and villages, and used surprisingly sophisticated architecture and design methods to build their shelters, new research has found. Many of the shelters the Aborigines built were dome structures. …</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-original-aborigines-get-their-food>How did the original aborigines get their food?</h2>
<p>From rainforest to desert, they made use of the land and harvested much of their food from their surroundings. From witchetty grubs to Jurassic-era pine cones filled with 100 “nuts”, discover 10 foods that made it onto the traditional Aussie bush tucker menu.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-aboriginals-eat-before-colonisation>What did aboriginals eat before Colonisation?</h2>
<p>Aboriginal people ate a large variety of plant foods such as fruits, nuts, roots, vegetables, grasses and seeds, as well as different meats such as kangaroos, ‘porcupine’7, emus, possums, goannas, turtles, shellfish and fish.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-houses-did-the-aboriginal-people-build>What kind of houses did the Aboriginal people build?</h2>
<p>A common stereotype is that Aboriginal people were ‘nomads’ and never built permanent shelters. The opposite is true. An area near Portland in southwest Victoria has evidence of volcanic stone huts that date back thousands of years .</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-aboriginal-people-build-rock-shelters>Why did the Aboriginal people build rock shelters?</h2>
<p>Studies of rock shelters that still contain evidence of occupation indicate that most faced north, north-east or north-west suggesting they were chosen to provide shelter from prevailing winds and to maximise exposure to the sun’s warmth. It may be, then, that these were favoured places in winter.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-aborigines-do-for-a-living>What did the aborigines do for a living?</h2>
<p>Australian Aborigines were nomadic people, hunting and food gathering as they travelled within their tribal boundaries. They made semi-permanent stops, camping for days or weeks in one place, depending on the availability of food and water.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rituals-did-the-aboriginal-people-have>What kind of rituals did the Aboriginal people have?</h2>
<p>In some Aboriginal societies, there were both male and female rituals that marked the passage from childhood to adulthood. Death in Aboriginal Australian societies was accompanied by complex rituals. Among the Walpiri of central Australia, a wife would have to isolate herself from the rest of the community upon the death of her husband.</p>
