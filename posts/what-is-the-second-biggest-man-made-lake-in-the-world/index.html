<p>Canada<br>
Being the second largest country in the world, it is no surprise that the country with the highest number of lakes is Canada – after all, a larger land volume means that there is a larger land area to include features such as lakes.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-lake-in-the-world>Which is the largest lake in the world?</h2>
<p>Kariba dam is the largest humanmade lake in the world. Located in Zambia and Zimbabwe, it can hold up to 180.6 cubic kilometers of water. It was constructed in 1959 on river Zambezi and has a height of 420 feet and a width of 1900 feet.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-man-made-lake-in-ghana>Which is the largest man made lake in Ghana?</h2>
<p>Lake Volta in Ghana. Lake Volta is the largest reservoir, man-made lake, in terms of surface area contained behind the Akosombo Dam.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-man-made-lake-in-the-south>Which is the largest man made lake in the south?</h2>
<p>Lake Marion, one of the largest lakes in the South, could fit into the same area almost 20 times over! There are, of course, bigger lakes by volume, as well as much larger naturally occurring lakes, but when it comes to man-made lakes and areas that they cover, these five take the top spots!</p>
