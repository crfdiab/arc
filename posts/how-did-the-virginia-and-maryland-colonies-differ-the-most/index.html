<h2 id=how-did-the-virginia-and-maryland-colonies-differ-the-most>How did the Virginia and Maryland colonies differ the most?</h2>
<p>Both colonies had governors and elected assemblies. They both had mild climate, tobacco farming, and the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River. The differences were that the king controlled the royal colony of Virginia, while the Calverts controlled the proprietary colony of Maryland.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-reason-for-the-virginia-settlement>What was the reason for the Virginia settlement?</h2>
<p>purpose of Virginia: Virginia was founded primarily for the purpose of profit by the joint-stock owned Virginia Company of London. It was also important in giving England territorial claims in America to match Spanish and French expansion, and to also give England markets and resources in the New World.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-war-between-maryland-and-pennsylvania-start>When did the war between Maryland and Pennsylvania start?</h2>
<p>Hostilities erupted in 1730 with a series of violent incidents prompted by disputes over property rights and law enforcement, and escalated through the first half of the decade, culminating in the deployment of military forces by Maryland in 1736 and by Pennsylvania in 1737.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-conflict-between-eastern-and-western-virginia>What was the conflict between Eastern and western Virginia?</h2>
<p>While eastern and western Virginia officially separated in the 19th century, disputes existed between them from 1776. Discrimination of poor westerners by the wealthy and more powerful easterners fuelled these conflicts. The easterners had both political and economic power over the westerners.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-idea-for-the-maryland-colony-come-from>Where did the idea for the Maryland colony come from?</h2>
<p>The idea for an English colony along the Chesapeake Bay where Catholics could live and worship in peace came from George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore. In 1632, he received a charter from King Charles I to found a colony east of the Potomac River.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-colony-of-maryland-similar-to-virginia>Is the colony of Maryland similar to Virginia?</h2>
<p>Despite early competition with the Virginia Colony to its south, and the Dutch colony of New Netherland to its north, the Province of Maryland developed along very similar lines to Virginia.</p>
