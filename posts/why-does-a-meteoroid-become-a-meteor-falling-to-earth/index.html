<h2 id=why-does-a-meteoroid-become-a-meteor-falling-to-earth>Why does a meteoroid become a meteor falling to Earth?</h2>
<p>When a meteoroid passes through Earth’s atmosphere, it heats up due to air resistance. The heat causes gases around the meteoroid to glow brightly. This glowing meteoroid is called a meteor, sometimes nicknamed a “shooting star.” Most meteoroids that enter Earth’s atmosphere disintegrate before they reach the ground.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-a-meteoroid-enters-the-earth>What is it called when a meteoroid enters the Earth?</h2>
<p>When meteoroids enter Earth’s atmosphere (or that of another planet, like Mars) at high speed and burn up, the fireballs or “shooting stars” are called meteors. When a meteoroid survives a trip through the atmosphere and hits the ground, it’s called a meteorite.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-meteors-attracted-to-earth>Why are meteors attracted to Earth?</h2>
<p>The fall of meteorites to the Earth’s surface is part of the continuing process of accretion of the Earth from the dust and rock of space. When these rock fragments come close enough to the Earth to be attracted by its gravity they may fall to the Earth to become part of it.</p>
<h2 id=are-shooting-stars-rare>Are Shooting Stars rare?</h2>
<p>Though folklore of many cultures describes shooting or falling stars as rare events, “they’re hardly rare or even stars,” says Luhman, Penn State assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics. Larger objects are called asteroids, and smaller, planetary dust, Luhman explains.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-shooting-stars-are-there-per-night>How many shooting stars are there per night?</h2>
<p>On any given night, depending on our luck, we can see between one and two shooting stars per hour; but on certain dates they occur much more frequently and many more can be seen: when this happens we call it a meteor shower.</p>
<h2 id=how-rare-is-seeing-two-shooting-stars>How rare is seeing two shooting stars?</h2>
<p>Not rare at all. If you watch the sky for an hour or so you will almost always see a meteor or two. Be aware, though, that light pollution in big cities can make meteors much more difficult to spot, especially if they are close to the horizon. It’s only rare because people don’t look at the night sky.</p>
<h2 id=do-stars-actually-fall>Do stars actually fall?</h2>
<p>A “falling star” or a “shooting star” has nothing at all to do with a star! These amazing streaks of light you can sometimes see in the night sky are caused by tiny bits of dust and rock called meteoroids falling into the Earth’s atmosphere and burning up.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-a-meteor-hits-the-earth>What happens when a meteor hits the Earth?</h2>
<p>If it enters into the Earth’s atmosphere and burns up, it’s a shooting star or meteor. If there’s anything left over after it hits the Earth’s surface, that’s a meteorite. The surface of the Earth is constantly being bombarded anywhere between 1 to 300 metric tons of dust every day, satellite data suggests.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-meteoroids-formed-in-the-upper-atmosphere>How are meteoroids formed in the upper atmosphere?</h2>
<p>Meteoroid s are lumps of rock or iron that orbit the sun. Most meteoroids are small fragment s of rock created by asteroid collision s. Comet s also create meteoroids as they orbit the sun and shed dust and debris. When a meteoroid enters the Earth’s upper atmosphere, it heats up due to friction from the air.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-meteoroids-fall-to-earth-every-day>How many meteoroids fall to Earth every day?</h2>
<p>Every day, approximately 3000 metric tons of dusty space material falls to Earth. A meteoroid is a piece of stony or metallic debris which travels in outer space. Meteoroids travel around the Sun in a variety of orbits and at various speeds. The fastest meteoroids move at about 42 kilometers per second.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-meteorites-attracted-to-the-earths-gravity>How are meteorites attracted to the Earth’s gravity?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, these rocks leave their paths and head straight for the earth, attracted by the earth’s gravitational pull. These heavenly bodies that fall to the earth are called meteorites. Usually, the earth is bombarded by several thousand of them each day.</p>
