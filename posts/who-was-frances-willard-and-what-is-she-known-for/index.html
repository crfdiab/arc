<h2 id=who-was-frances-willard-and-what-is-she-known-for>Who was Frances Willard and what is she known for?</h2>
<p>An excellent speaker, a successful lobbyist, and an expert in pressure politics, she was a leader of the national Prohibition Party. Willard grew up from the age of two in Oberlin, Ohio, and from six in Janesville, Wisconsin Territory.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-frances-willard-and-the-wctu-do>What did Frances Willard and the WCTU do?</h2>
<p>For the next two decades Willard led the temperance movement as the WCTU became one of the largest and most influential women’s groups of the 19th century. She expanded the organization’s platform to include such issues as labour laws and prison reform, and in 1891 she became president of the World WCTU (founded 1883).</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-wctu-accomplish>What did the WCTU accomplish?</h2>
<p>The WCTU was a religious organization whose primary purpose was to combat the influence of alcohol on families and society. It was influential in the temperance movement, and supported the 18th Amendment. The Woman’s Christian Union (WCTU) was founded in Cleveland, Ohio in November of 1874.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-frances-willard-do-for-womens-rights>What did Frances Willard do for women’s rights?</h2>
<p>Willard became the national president of Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in 1879 and remained president until her death in 1898. Her influence continued in the next decades, as the Eighteenth (on Prohibition) and Nineteenth (on women’s suffrage) Amendments to the United States Constitution were adopted.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-frances-willard-important>Why is Frances Willard important?</h2>
<p>American educator, temperance reformer, and women’s suffragist, Willard’s influence was instrumental in the passage of the 18th and 19th Amendments to the United States Constitution. Willard became the national president of Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), in 1879, and remained president for 19 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-womens-temperance-activities-contribute-to-the-cause-of-womens-suffrage>How did the women’s temperance activities contribute to the cause of women’s suffrage?</h2>
<p>Advocates for temperance wanted women to have the vote because it was believed they would vote for prohibition due to their moral superiority. Many breweries, on the other hand, lobbied against the suffrage movement out of fear of losing their businesses to prohibition.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-frances-ewillard-do-for-a-living>What did Frances e.willard do for a living?</h2>
<p>In 1873, she helped found the Association for the Advancement of Women. Willard left education for work in temperance in 1874. In that year, the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was founded with Willard as the first corresponding secretary. In 1879, she would become its second president.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-frances-willard-contribute-to-the-temperance-movement>What did Frances Willard contribute to the temperance movement?</h2>
<p>A pioneer in the temperance movement, Frances Willard is also remembered for her contributions to higher education.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-frances-ewillard-important-to-the-wctu>Why was Frances e.willard important to the WCTU?</h2>
<p>Later, thanks to Willard<code>s influence, the WCTU also willingly took on women</code>s suffrage as a cause. She had reasoned that local elections on the issue of whether liquor could be sold in neighborhoods would have an impact on women, so it was important for them to have the right to vote on it.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-frances-willard-resign-from-the-university>When did Frances Willard resign from the University?</h2>
<p>She remained there until her constant conflicts with the university’s president, Charles H. Fowler (to whom she had been engaged in 1861), led her to resign in 1874.</p>
