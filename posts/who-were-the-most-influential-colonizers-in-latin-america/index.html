<h2 id=who-were-the-most-influential-colonizers-in-latin-america>Who were the most influential colonizers in Latin America?</h2>
<p>Latin America came to fruition in the 1500’s after European “discovery” of the New World. Countries such as Spain, France and Portugal colonized the region. Although most of Latin America was colonized by Spain, the countries of Portugal and France also had major influences on the region.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-latin-american-revolution>Who was involved in the Latin American revolution?</h2>
<p>José de San Martín, along with Simón Bolívar, was one of the most important leaders of the Latin American independence movements. His military leadership was crucial in the wars of independence in Argentina, Chile, and Peru.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-spanish-influence-culture-in-latin-america>How did Spanish influence culture in Latin America?</h2>
<p>In the absence of indigenous alternatives, Spanish language and culture became dominant in Latin America. Spanish became the primary language in many Latin American countries. When it was first introduced, many native South Americans melded Roman Catholicism into their traditional religious practices.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-responsible-for-the-expansion-of-the-spanish-empire>Who was responsible for the expansion of the Spanish Empire?</h2>
<p>The overseas expansion under the Crown of Castile was initiated under the royal authority and first accomplished by the Spanish conquistadors. The Americas were incorporated into the Spanish Empire, with the exception of Brazil, Canada, the eastern United States and several other small countries in South America and The Caribbean.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-spanish-take-control-of-the-caribbean>When did the Spanish take control of the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>Beginning with the 1492 arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean and gaining control over more territory for over three centuries, the Spanish Empire would expand across the Caribbean Islands, half of South America, most of Central America and much of North America.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-founding-fathers-of-latin-america>Who are the founding fathers of Latin America?</h2>
<p>Translations of speeches made by the founding fathers of the United States, including Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, also circulated in Latin America. Not all creoles however, believed in independence and democracy—in fact, there existed an opposition of creole royalists who supported the Spanish Crown and allied themselves with the Peninsulares.</p>
