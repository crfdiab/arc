<h2 id=why-was-harold-godwinson-a-good-leader>Why was Harold Godwinson a good leader?</h2>
<p>Harold had proved himself to be a strong leader with great military and diplomatic ability having spent many years ruling England on Edward’s behalf. The Witan believed that the one blood claimant, Edgar Atheling, who was only a teenager at the time, was too young to bear the challenges of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 id=was-harold-godwinson-a-good-general>Was Harold Godwinson a good general?</h2>
<p>A strong ruler and a skilled general, he held the crown for nine months in 1066 before he was killed at the Battle of Hastings by Norman invaders under William the Conqueror. Harold’s mother, Gytha, belonged to a powerful Danish noble family with close connections to Canute, the Danish king of England.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-witan-mean>What does the witan mean?</h2>
<p>An Anglo-Saxon term that meant wise men, persons learned in the law; in particular, the king’s advisers or members of his council. The Witenagemote was the great council of the Anglo-Saxons in England, comprising the aristocrats of the kingdom, along with bishops and other high ecclesiastical leaders. …</p>
<h2 id=how-did-king-harold-win-the-battle-of-stamford-bridge>How did King Harold win the Battle of Stamford Bridge?</h2>
<p>King Harold won a famous victory but lost a third of his forces, and only four days later led his army on another exhausting forced march to confront Duke William near the south coast of England.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-was-hardrada-in-battle-of-stamford-bridge>How tall was Hardrada in Battle of Stamford Bridge?</h2>
<p>It is said that Harold replied: “I will give him just six feet of English soil; or, since they say he is a tall man, I will give him seven feet.” With Hardrada was Harold’s brother, Tostig, and 300 ships. Harold and what was left of his army headed north.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-harold-disband-his-army-at-stamford-bridge>Why did Harold disband his army at Stamford Bridge?</h2>
<p>In Normandy, William’s fleet gathered, but was unable to depart St. Valéry sur Somme due to adverse winds. In early September, with supplies low and his troops’ obligations expiring, Harold was forced to disband his army. Shortly thereafter, Hardrada’s forces began landing at Tyne.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-winner-of-the-battle-of-fulford>Who was the winner of the Battle of Fulford?</h2>
<p>Only six days after the Battle of Fulford the English forces led by King Harold won an astonishing victory against the Norwegian forces of Harald Hardrada. The outcome was a decisive victory for King Harold II.</p>
