<h2 id=how-many-planets-has-nasa-landed-on>How many planets has NASA landed on?</h2>
<p>The current count orbiting our star: eight. The inner, rocky planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. NASA’s newest rover — Perseverance — landed on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021.</p>
<h2 id=has-a-spacecraft-landed-on-jupiter>Has a spacecraft landed on Jupiter?</h2>
<p>The spacecraft, which arrived at Jupiter in July 2016, is the first to study the planet’s mysterious, cloud-shrouded interior. Scientists also use the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes to regularly check in on Jupiter. Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to fly past Jupiter.</p>

<p>Mars<br>
NASA’s newest rover — Perseverance — landed on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. The outer planets are gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.</p>
<h2 id=has-a-spacecraft-landed-on-neptune>Has a spacecraft landed on Neptune?</h2>
<p>Marking the end of the Voyager mission’s Grand Tour of the solar system’s four giant planets — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — that first was also a last: No other spacecraft has visited Neptune since.</p>
<h2 id=is-voyager-still-sending-pictures>Is Voyager still sending pictures?</h2>
<p>There will be no more pictures; engineers turned off the spacecraft’s cameras, to save memory, in 1990, after Voyager 1 snapped the famous image of Earth as a “pale blue dot” in the darkness. Out there in interstellar space, where Voyager 1 roams, there’s “nothing to take pictures of,” Dodd said.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-spacecraft-that-have-landed-on-other-planets>Are there any spacecraft that have landed on other planets?</h2>
<p>This is a list of all spacecraft landings on other planets and bodies in the Solar System, including soft landings and both intended and unintended hard impacts. The list includes orbiters that were intentionally crashed, but not orbiters which later crashed in an unplanned manner due to orbital decay .</p>
<h2 id=how-many-minor-planets-have-been-visited-by-spacecraft>How many minor planets have been visited by spacecraft?</h2>
<p>The following tables list all minor planets and comets that have been visited by robotic spacecraft . Since the 1990s, a total of 16 minor planets – various asteroids, dwarf planets, and Kuiper belt objects – have been visited by space probes.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-spacecraft-land-on-the-moon>Where did the spacecraft land on the Moon?</h2>
<p>Each spacecraft had a destination and a duty to perform. According to documentation, spacecrafts have landed and sent information from the moon, jupiter, venus, camets, saturn’s moon, asteroids, and mars.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-space-craft-that-landed-on-mars>What was the name of the space craft that landed on Mars?</h2>
<p>NASA also sent a pair of Mars Exploration Rovers in 2004. Spirit transmitted information back to Earth until 2010, while Opportunity is still roaming the surface. The more massive Curiosity lander followed them in 2012. Another stationary spacecraft, Phoenix, successfully landed close to the planet’s north pole in 2008.</p>
