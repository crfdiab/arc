<h2 id=how-did-the-missionaries-change-hawaii>How did the missionaries change Hawaii?</h2>
<p>In Hawaii, the missionaries converted Hawaiian people to the Christian faith, developed the written form of Hawaiian, discouraged many Hawaiian cultural practices, introduced their Western practices, and encouraged the spread of English.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-missionaries-teach-the-hawaiians>What did the missionaries teach the Hawaiians?</h2>
<p>Education of the Hawaiians was a high priority among the missionaries. Once materials were printed in Hawaiian, the missionaries could teach reading, writing, arithmetic, and religion to the native populations.</p>
<h2 id=what-religion-were-the-first-missionaries-to-hawaii>What religion were the first missionaries to Hawaii?</h2>
<p>The first missionaries to arrive in the Islands were Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Dutch Reformists from New England. Sailing in the Thaddeus, 14 missionaries (seven mission couples) and four Hawaiian boys left Boston, funded by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-hawaiian-religion-called>What is Hawaiian religion called?</h2>
<p>polytheistic<br>
Hawaiian religion is polytheistic, with many deities, most prominently Kāne, Kū, Lono and Kanaloa. Other notable deities include Laka, Kihawahine, Haumea, Papahānaumoku, and, most famously, Pele. In addition, each family is considered to have one or more guardian spirits known as ʻaumakua that protected family.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-missionaries-do-when-they-got-to-hawaii>What did the missionaries do when they got to Hawaii?</h2>
<p>At the end of their 18,000-mile journey, the missionaries were expected to become permanent residents of Hawaii — indeed, they were required to give up their U.S. citizenship to settle there. If they were successful in their work, they would spend the rest of their lives unimaginably far from home.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-hawaiian-government>Who was the leader of the Hawaiian government?</h2>
<p>There were calls for a white-free legislature, and there were complaints that most land was held by foreigners. “Hawaii for Hawaiians” had become a slogan. A German-born financier from California, Claus Spreckels, dominated the purchase of sugarcane from the growers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-native-hawaiians-feel-about-the-white-owners>How did the Native Hawaiians feel about the white owners?</h2>
<p>Native Hawaiians as they were declining in numberwere becoming increasingly hostile to white business owners, whom they characterized as arrogant and uncharitable opportunists. There were calls for a white-free legislature, and there were complaints that most land was held by foreigners. “Hawaii for Hawaiians” had become a slogan.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-us-sign-the-treaty-of-reciprocity-with-hawaii>When did the US sign the Treaty of reciprocity with Hawaii?</h2>
<p>In 1875 the United States signed a “treaty of reciprocity” with the Kingdom of Hawaii – free trade. There were complaints from southern congressmen about injury to the sugar and rice producers in their area, and complaints were made that cheap rice from Asia would enter the United States duty-free by way of the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
