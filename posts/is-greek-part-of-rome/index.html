<h2 id=is-greek-part-of-rome>Is Greek part of Rome?</h2>
<p>Greece was a key eastern province of the Roman Empire, as the Roman culture had long been in fact Greco-Roman. The Greek language served as a lingua franca in the East and in Italy, and many Greek intellectuals such as Galen would perform most of their work in Rome.</p>
<h2 id=is-rome-and-greece-the-same>Is Rome and Greece the same?</h2>
<p>Both Greece and Rome are Mediterranean countries, similar enough latitudinally for both to grow wine and olives. However, their terrains were quite different. The ancient Greek city-states were separated from each other by hilly countryside and all were near the water.</p>
<h2 id=is-greece-still-ruled-by-rome>Is Greece still ruled by Rome?</h2>
<p>Rome continued its conquest of Greece. The Greeks were finally defeated at the Battle of Corinth in 146 BC. From this point on Greece was ruled by Rome. Despite being ruled by Rome, much of the Greek culture remained the same and had a heavy influence on Roman culture.</p>
<h2 id=did-greece-come-from-rome>Did Greece come from Rome?</h2>
<p>Greece was a collection of City-States that couldn’t figure out if they were friend or foe. After incorporating ideas from the Greeks in the 8th century BC, the Roman Empire eventually incorporated Greece in the 2nd century BC. In the 4th century BC, the forces of the Roman Republic conquered all of central Italy.</p>
<h2 id=did-greece-fight-rome>Did Greece fight Rome?</h2>
<p>The two powers actually fought three wars, from 217 to 205 BC, 200 to 197 BC and 171 to 168 BC; the second was of most consequence. A short but brutal affair, it was also the conflict that saw Rome’s authority stamped on Greece, and is the one upon which we will focus.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-greece-was-part-of-the-roman-empire>Is it true Greece was part of the Roman Empire?</h2>

<h2 id=where-was-the-capital-of-the-roman-empire>Where was the capital of the Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>The region of Greece became an ever more important part during the period of the Roman Empire, with the Capital of the Empire as a whole eventually becoming Constantinople, a City in the Greece region.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-romans-take-over-the-greek-world>When did the Romans take over the Greek world?</h2>
<p>During the period of the Roman Republic, Greece was finally conquered/annexed at around 146 BCE, and was divided into two Roman Provinces, Macedonia and Achea. At this stage, the Romans had conquered most of the Greek world since they also owned Western Anatolia.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-capital-of-greece-located-in-the-world>Where is the capital of Greece located in the world?</h2>
