<p>magnitude 7.3<br>
The largest historic earthquake in the Rocky Mountains was a magnitude 7.3 earthquake at Hebgen Lake northwest of Yellowstone in 1959. It was caused by the extension–or stretching–of the Earth’s crust. The earthquake displaced a 40-km-long fault (25 miles) that rose vertically up to 12 meters (40 feet).</p>
