<h2 id=how-did-allies-benefit>How did allies benefit?</h2>
<p>American Allies. The American colonists did not fight the Revolutionary War for independence from Britain by themselves. They had allies who helped them by providing aid in the form of supplies, weapons, military leaders, and soldiers. These allies played a major role in helping the colonists to gain their independence …</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-alliances-help-lead-to-world-war>How did the alliances help lead to world war?</h2>
<p>The alliance system caused the World War I to escalate from a regional conflict into a global war. Two major alliances existed in Europe prior to World War I. Austria and Serbia were allied with Germany and Russia respectively, leading Germany and Russia to declare war on each other.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-imperialism-lead-to-war>How does imperialism lead to war?</h2>
<p>The expansion of European nations as empires (also known as imperialism) can be seen as a key cause of World War I, because as countries like Britain and France expanded their empires, it resulted in increased tensions among European countries.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-allies-rebuild-the-world-after-world-war-2>How did the Allies rebuild the world after World War 2?</h2>
<p>The allies did what they could to feed and house the refugees and to reunite families that had been forcibly torn apart, but the scale of the task and the obstacles were enormous. The majority of ports in Europe and many in Asia had been destroyed or badly damaged; bridges had been blown up; railway locomotives and rolling stock had vanished.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-allied-powers-in-world-war-2>Who are the Allied Powers in World War 2?</h2>
<p>The Dardanelles Campaign against the Turks was a bloody defeat for the Allies. In World War II the chief Allied powers were Great Britain, France (except during the German occupation, 1940–44), the Soviet Union (after its entry in June 1941), the United States (after its entry on December 8, 1941), and China.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-deal-with-the-aftermath-of-world-war-2>How did people deal with the aftermath of World War 2?</h2>
<p>They were struggling to look after their own peoples and deal with reincorporating their military into civilian society. The four horsemen of the apocalypse – pestilence, war, famine and death – so familiar during the middle ages, appeared again in the modern world. Politically, the impact of the war was also great.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-survive-in-europe-after-world-war-2>How did people survive in Europe after World War 2?</h2>
<p>Many Europeans were surviving on less than 1,000 calories per day; in the Netherlands they were eating tulip bulbs. Apart from the United States and allies such as Canada and Australia, who were largely unscathed by the war’s destruction, the European powers such as Britain and France had precious little to spare.</p>
