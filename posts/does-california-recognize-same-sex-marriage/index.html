<h2 id=does-california-recognize-same-sex-marriage>Does California recognize same-sex marriage?</h2>
<p>California allows same-sex marriages and will grant divorces to same-sex couples who have lived in the state for six months or who were married in California and cannot divorce where they live.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-for-same-sex-marriage-in-california>Is it legal for same-sex marriage in California?</h2>
<p>Same-sex marriage is legal in the U.S. state of California. The state first issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples June 16, 2008 as a result of the Supreme Court of California finding in In re Marriage Cases that barring same-sex couples from marriage violated the state’s Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-get-married-in-california-for-same-sex>How do you get married in California for same-sex?</h2>
<p>The couple needs to obtain a marriage license from a county office after filling out an application and showing a picture I.D. that proves they are both over 18 years old. The license is valid for 90 days. There is no residency requirement to marry in California, so out-of-state same-sex couples may marry in the state.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-belgium-legalise-same-sex-marriage-in-the-world>When did Belgium legalise same-sex marriage in the world?</h2>
<p>On 1 June 2003, Belgium became the second country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage, after the Netherlands.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-foreign-couple-get-married-in-belgium>Can a foreign couple get married in Belgium?</h2>
<p>Originally, Belgium allowed the marriages of foreign same-sex couples only if their country of origin also allowed these unions. A circulaire by Minister of Justice Laurette Onkelinx (PS) of 23 January 2004, however, permits any couple to marry in Belgium if at least one of the spouses has lived in the country for a minimum of three months.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-california-start-issuing-same-sex-marriage-licenses>When did California start issuing same sex marriage licenses?</h2>
<p>The state first issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples June 16, 2008 as a result of the Supreme Court of California finding in In re Marriage Cases that barring same-sex couples from marriage violated the state’s Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-countries-that-have-legalized-same-sex-marriage>Are there any countries that have legalized same sex marriage?</h2>
<p>In addition, some cities have issued certificates for same-sex couples, but they are not legally binding. Limited to spouses of foreign diplomatic officials. Same-sex marriage, also known as gay marriage, is the marriage of two people of the same sex or gender, entered into in a civil or religious ceremony.</p>
