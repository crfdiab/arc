<p>The War of 1812 was declared by United States against Great Britain, and it ended in late 1814 with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which did not declare either side as the victor. Instead, the treaty roughly reinstated the conditions that were in effect before the war and did not answer or address any of the issues over which the war started.</p>

<p>Did the War of 1812 have popular support? The War of 1812 had only mixed support on both sides of the Atlantic. The British weren’t eager for another conflict, having fought Napoleon for the better part of the previous 20 years, but weren’t fond of American commercial support of the French either.</p>
