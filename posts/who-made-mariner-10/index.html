<h2 id=who-made-mariner-10>Who made Mariner 10?</h2>

<h2 id=when-was-mariner-10-launched-and-what-did-this-spacecraft-do>When was Mariner 10 launched and what did this spacecraft do?</h2>
<p>Mariner 10 was the first spacecraft to use the gravitational pull of one planet to reach another and the first probe to visit two planets. Launched November 3, 1973, it reached Venus on February 5, 1974. Using gravity assist, it went on to fly by Mercury.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-mariner-10-learn-about-mercury>What did Mariner 10 learn about Mercury?</h2>
<p>Scientists believed that Mercury’s magnetic field came from within the planet rather than being generated through the planet’s interaction with the solar wind. Mariner 10 detected a faint helium atmosphere around the solar system’s innermost planet.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-mariner-2>What was the purpose of Mariner 2?</h2>
<p>Mariner 2 was a backup for the Mariner 1 mission which failed shortly after launch to Venus. The objective of the Mariner 2 mission was to fly by Venus and return data on the planet’s atmosphere, magnetic field, charged particle environment, and mass.</p>
<h2 id=was-the-mariner-10-successful>Was the Mariner 10 successful?</h2>
<p>The mission of Mariner 10 was a great success and unique in many ways. It was the first spacecraft to use gravity assist to visit more than one planet, a technique now used regularly to visit multiple bodies in the solar system.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-major-difference-between-mariner-10-and-messenger>What is the major difference between Mariner 10 and Messenger?</h2>
<p>What is the major difference between Mariner 10 and Messenger? Mariner 10 flew past Mercury several times. Messenger went into orbit around the planet. dense iron core taking up almost half of the volume of the planet and a rocky mantle surrounding the core.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-mariner-10-mission>What was the purpose of the Mariner 10 mission?</h2>
<p>Mariner 10 was the only mission to Mercury until NASA’s MESSENGER mission more than 30 years later. On its way to Mercury, Mariner 10 became the first spacecraft to use the gravity of one planet (in this case, Venus) to reach another. This has become an extremely important technique.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-mariner-10-get-to-mercury>How did the Mariner 10 get to Mercury?</h2>
<p>Venus’ gravity field first slowed the velocity of Mariner 10 to about 16,000 km/h and then slung it onto a new path toward Mercury. About five weeks later, on March 23, Mariner 10 began taking intermittent pictures of Mercury.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-last-mission-of-the-mariner-program>What was the last mission of the Mariner program?</h2>
<p>All told, Mariner 10 took about 7,000 photos of the Earth, Moon, Venus and Mercury. It would be the last mission in NASA’s Mariner program (with two slated missions to visit Saturn and Jupiter becoming the first missions the Voyager program to explore the outer Solar System).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rocket-did-the-mariner-10-use>What kind of rocket did the Mariner 10 use?</h2>
<p>The first five Mariners were launched on Atlas-Agena rockets, while the last five used the Atlas-Centaur. All Mariner-based probes after Mariner 10 used the Titan IIIE, Titan IV unmanned rockets or the Space Shuttle with a solid-fueled Inertial Upper Stage and multiple planetary flybys.</p>
