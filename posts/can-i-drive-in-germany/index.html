<h2 id=can-i-drive-in-germany>Can I drive in Germany?</h2>
<p>Your own driver’s license is valid in Germany, at least at the outset. If you’re just visiting and are from outside the EU and EEA and don’t intend to become a resident, you may need to get an International Driving Permit or an official translation of your home country license to carry along with your current license.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-driving-rules-in-germany>What are the driving rules in Germany?</h2>
<p>Here are the most important rules for driving in Germany:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive on the right in Germany.</li>
<li>Overtake to the left of the other vehicle in free flowing traffic.</li>
<li>It is compulsory for a driver to have driving licence, car registration and ownership (Zulassungsbescheinigung Teil I und II) and insurance documents in the car.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=can-i-drive-in-germany-with-all-season-tyres>Can I drive in Germany with all-season Tyres?</h2>
<p>In short: only winter tyres or all-season tyres that have the Alpine symbol (a symbol that looks like a snowflake) still comply with the new rules. German law does not refer to winter tyres, but to “tyres with winter properties”. It is mandatory to use this type of tyre in winter conditions.</p>
<h2 id=what-months-do-you-need-winter-tyres-in-germany>What months do you need winter Tyres in Germany?</h2>
<p>Trucks and buses must have snow tires at all times from November through April 15, whether there are “winter conditions” or not. The snow tire law applies to all drivers, even if they do not own the vehicle! But the 2015 law makes car owners – and rental car companies – also responsible.</p>
<h2 id=do-all-season-tires-have-the-snowflake>Do all season tires have the snowflake?</h2>
<p>Mountain/Snowflake Symbol – Severe Snow and Winter Traction This includes snowy, slippery roads and low temperature or freezing roads. Most all-season tires do not qualify for the Mountain/Snowflake symbol because the tread rubber in all-season and summer tires become hard at temperatures below 40 F.</p>
<h2 id=what-tyres-do-i-need-in-winter-in-germany>What tyres do I need in winter in Germany?</h2>
<p>Germany introduced regulations in 2010 requiring all passenger cars and motorbikes to be fitted with winter tyres or all season tyres on all axles in wintry conditions. Snow chains – REQUIRED (should be carried and used as dictated by local signs or road conditions. Reduced speed limits may apply).</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-best-car-to-drive-in-germany>What is the best car to drive in Germany?</h2>
<p>We’ve compiled a list of the some of the best used German cars available.</p>
<ul>
<li>BMW 3 Series. Originally created in 1975, the BMW 3 Series is the textbook answer for a classy executive saloon car.</li>
<li>Volkswagen Golf.</li>
<li>Mercedes-Benz C-Class.</li>
<li>Audi TT.</li>
<li>Porsche 911.</li>
<li>Mercedes-Benz S-Class.</li>
<li>Audi Q5.</li>
<li>BMW 1 Series.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=is-it-an-offence-to-drive-in-germany-without-a-license>Is it an offence to drive in Germany without a license?</h2>
<p>If it happens, there is the possibility that only the violatioin against the regulation of “carrying a driving licence” is punished abroad as sometimes the criminal offence “driving without a driving licence” does not exist in this country. German driving laws allow for two different kinds of driving bans.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-driving-bans-in-germany-in-2016>Are there any driving bans in Germany in 2016?</h2>
<p>Here you can find details for driving bans valid in 2016. GERMANY. Driving ban applies all year long to the entire national road network for vehicles with a legal maximum weight exceeding 7.5 tons and semi-trailers between 00:00 and 22:00 on Sundays and public holidays.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-legal-alcohol-limit-for-driving-in-germany>What’s the legal alcohol limit for driving in Germany?</h2>
<p>The legal limit is 49 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. Penalties include fines and being banned from driving in Germany. If you’re under 21 or have held your licence for less than 2 years, there is a zero limit and you could be fined €250 if even a small amount of alcohol is detected.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-get-fined-for-driving-in-germany>What happens if you get fined for driving in Germany?</h2>
<p>Penalties include fines and being banned from driving in Germany. If you’re under 21 or have held your licence for less than 2 years, there is a zero limit and you could be fined €250 if even a small amount of alcohol is detected. Fines can be on-the-spot or in the form of a deposit, if you refuse to pay your vehicle can be confiscated.</p>
