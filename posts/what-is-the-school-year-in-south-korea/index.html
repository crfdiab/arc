<h2 id=when-does-the-school-year-start-in-south-korea>When does the school year start in South Korea?</h2>
<p>The School Year in South Korea. Most schools operate year-round, but their peak hiring months tend to be February and March. Universities make most of their final hiring decisions in early August and spend a few months prior gathering resumes and doing interviews. The dates listed here are the major holidays.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-saturdays-are-there-in-a-month-in-korea>How many Saturdays are there in a month in Korea?</h2>
<p>If you think Korean students have the weekend for recreation, think again. The official school days were originally Monday to Saturday, which didn’t make for happy students or teachers. Since 2010, the school schedule, has changed and loosened up. Now the Korean public school system has two Saturdays per month, off.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-teachers-change-schools-in-korea>How often do teachers change schools in Korea?</h2>
<p>Teachers rotate schools every five years. It doesn’t matter if you love your school or not. After each five year term, the teachers, vice principal and principal undergo a lottery system and have to change schools. Thus, each year, a school may get new staff.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-education-system-does-south-korea-have>What kind of education system does South Korea have?</h2>
<p>South Korea is known for their education system, which includes very long days of up to (or over) 12 hours. Because of intense competition and cultural factors, high school students are encouraged to do schooling beyond the typical 8am-4pm schedule.</p>
