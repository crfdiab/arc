<h2 id=what-did-the-delegates-decide-to-do-with-the-articles-of-confederation>What did the delegates decide to do with the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>Instead of revising the Articles of Confederation what did the delegates decide to do? They wrote a new constitution.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-confederation-congress-met-to-amend-the-articles-of-confederation>Did the Confederation Congress met to amend the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>The Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation, the first constitution of the United States, on November 15, 1777, but the states did not ratify them until March 1, 1781. “An opinion begins to prevail that a general convention for revising the articles of Confederation would be expedient.”</p>
<h2 id=where-did-delegates-meet-to-discuss-problems-with-the-articles-of-confederation>Where did delegates meet to discuss problems with the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>Constitutional Convention and Ratification, 1787–1789 The Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia met between May and September of 1787 to address the problems of the weak central government that existed under the Articles of Confederation.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-delegates-appointed-in-the-articles-of-confederation>How are delegates appointed in the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>Each state legislature appointed delegates to the Congress; these men could be recalled at any time. Regardless of its size or the number of delegates it chose to send, each state would have only one vote. Delegates could serve for no more than three consecutive years, lest a class of elite professional politicians develop.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-articles-of-confederation>What was the purpose of the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>Instead of outlining a national system of elections to Congress, which would be more reflective of the overall population of the United States, the Articles of Confederation require that each state provide at least two delegates, regardless of the amount of land, population size, or wealth of that state.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-states-send-delegates-to-the-convention>Why did the states send delegates to the convention?</h2>
<p>Between Madison’s initial call for the states to send delegates to Annapolis and the presentation of Madison’s Virginia plan for a new government to the convention in Philadelphia, a fundamental shift in the aims of the convention process had taken place. No longer were the delegates gathered with the aim of tweaking trade agreements.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-articles-of-confederation-a-weakness>Why are the Articles of Confederation a weakness?</h2>
<p>The Articles’ failure to empower the central government to carry out essential functions was their primary weakness. The Articles protected the sovereignty of the states at the expense of the central government, which lacked the power to raise revenue or conduct diplomatic relations.</p>
