<p>Seymour has been married and divorced four times. The following year, Seymour married actor James Keach. Together they had twins, John Stacy and Kristopher Steven, born 30 November 1995, and named after family friends Johnny Cash and Christopher Reeve and James’s brother, actor Stacy Keach.</p>

<p>Following their divorce, Jane tied the knot with fellow actor James Keach shortly after in 1993. The lovebirds expanded the Somewhere in Time star’s family when their twin sons, John Stacy Keach and Kristopher Steven Keach, arrived in 1995.
