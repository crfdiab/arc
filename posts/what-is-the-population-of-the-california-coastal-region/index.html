<h2 id=what-is-the-coast-of-california-called>What is the coast of California called?</h2>
<p>Coastal California, also known as the California Coastline and the Golden Coast, refers to the coastal regions of the U.S. state of California. The term is not primarily geographical as it also describes an area distinguished by cultural, economic and political attributes.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-coastal-counties-are-in-california>How many coastal counties are in California?</h2>
<p>From south to north, there are six counties that make up the Central Coast: Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, San Benito, and Santa Cruz….Central Coast (California)</p>
<table><tr><th>Central Coast</th></tr><tr><td>Pismo Beach in San Luis Obispo County</td></tr><tr><td>Sunset at Salinas River State Beach in Monterey County</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>State</td><td>California</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-central-coast-of-california-known-for>What is the central coast of California known for?</h2>
<p>The Central Coast isn’t just in the heart of California, it is the heart of California. Just north of Los Angeles, the Central Coast’s Ventura Region is home to rugged mountains, sandy beaches, fertile farmland, and a lively arts scene.</p>
<h2 id=is-california-a-coastal-state>Is California a coastal state?</h2>
<p>All of the five major U.S. territories have coastlines — three of them have a coastline on the Pacific Ocean, and two of them have a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean (Caribbean Sea)….Table.</p>
<table><tr><th>State or territory</th><td>California</td></tr><tr><th>Method 1 (CRS)</th><th>Coastline</th><td>840 mi (1,350 km)</td></tr><tr><th>Rank</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Method 2 (NOAA)</th><th>Coastline</th><td>3,427 mi (5,515 km)</td></tr><tr><th>Rank</th><td>5</td></tr></table>

</ol>
<h2 id=what-state-has-the-longest-shoreline>What state has the longest shoreline?</h2>
<p>Michigan has the longest freshwater coastline in the US. World Book Encyclopedia (v. 13, p. 500 of the 2000 edition) states that Michigan’s shoreline, at 3,288 miles is “more than any other state except Alaska.</p>
<h2 id=is-pismo-beach-or-avila-beach-better>Is Pismo Beach or Avila beach better?</h2>
<p>Better beach, better atmosphere. Downtown Pismo is cheesy and noisy. Lots of construction in the thick of it. Avila has wine tasting in town, Mr Rick’s for cocktails, coffee bars, eateries, etc.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-coastal-areas-more-densely-populated-than-inland-areas>Why are coastal areas more densely populated than inland areas?</h2>
<p>These days coastal populations still grow faster than inland settlements. Much of this is driven by tourism and migration. They are more densely populated because the benefits of being on the coast become much more marginal the further out you get. 5 worst foods for arthritis and joint pain. Avoid these foods if you have arthritis or joint pain.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-coastlines-good-places-for-humans-to-live>Why are coastlines good places for humans to live?</h2>
<p>The biogical complexity of coastlines just makes it easier for humans to survive without to much specialisation. This means opportunists thrive better than in the plains of Mongolia, the desert sands of Sahara or the mountains of Himalaya. It is comfortable and easy to sustain life along a shoreline.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-river-deltas-more-important-than-shorelines>Why are river deltas more important than shorelines?</h2>
<p>There is a simple historical and biological explanation for this. In river deltas nutrient elements pile up due to erosion. All kinds of organisms feed on this and food is easely obtained. Shorelines in that same way as river deltas give more opportunities for food gatherings and hunting and fishing, than areas more monocultural.</p>
