<h2 id=who-went-with-shackleton-to-south-georgia>Who went with Shackleton to South Georgia?</h2>
<p>Recognising the futility of waiting on the island for an unknown rescue party to arrive, Shackleton instead opted to himself launch the James Caird (with five crew members – captain Frank Worsley, second officer Thomas Crean, carpenter Harry McNish, and sailors Timothy McCarthy and John Vincent), and attempt to sail …</p>
<h2 id=who-went-with-shackleton-to-the-whaling-station>Who went with Shackleton to the whaling station?</h2>
<p>After surviving a series of dangers, including a near capsizing, the boat reached the southern coast of South Georgia after a 16-day voyage. Shackleton, Tom Crean and Frank Worsley crossed the island’s mountains to a whaling station on the north side.</p>
<h2 id=who-went-with-shackleton-to-elephant-island>Who went with Shackleton to Elephant island?</h2>
<p>Shackleton sailed with Tom Crean, Frank Worsley, Harry “Chippy” McNish, Tim McCarthy, and John Vincent on an 1,300 km (800 mi) voyage in the open lifeboat James Caird beginning on Easter Monday, April 24, 1916, and arriving at South Georgia 16 days later.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-on-shackletons-crew>Who was on Shackleton’s crew?</h2>
<p>Shackleton chose the following officers for the voyage – Frank Wild, Frank Worsley, Lionel Greenstreet, Tom Crean and Alfred Cheetham, they accompanied the crew and the scientists on board.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hours-did-it-take-to-cross-south-georgia>How many hours did it take to cross South Georgia?</h2>
<p>The three men marched across the wild and mountainous terrain of Georgia Island, covering 32 miles in 36 hours to reach the Stromness whaling station—and help at long last.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-south-georgia-in-the-atlantic>Where is South Georgia in the Atlantic?</h2>
<p>South Georgia, mountainous barren island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles (1,300 km) east-southeast of the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas). It is part of the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, although Argentina also claims the territory.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-shackletons-boat-called>What was Shackleton’s boat called?</h2>
<p>the Endurance<br>
The attempt this week to find Sir Ernest Shackleton’s missing ship, the Endurance, has ended – without success. A UK-led expedition to the Weddell Sea sent a sub to the ocean floor to look for the sunken polar yacht, but this robot was itself lost in the process.</p>
<h2 id=do-people-live-in-elephant-island>Do people live in Elephant Island?</h2>
<p>The population in Elephant Island is 0. The only people who live in the Elephant Island are researchers who have camped in the island during summer. However, no permanent human settlement is found in Elephant Island. Elephant Island is within the Antarctic claims of countries like UK, Argentina and Chile.</p>
<h2 id=did-any-of-shackletons-crew-die>Did any of Shackleton’s crew die?</h2>
<p>The ill-fated trip saw his ship Endurance became trapped in ice for 10 months before it sank, but not one of the expedition’s members died. Sir Ernest Shackleton’s granddaughter Alexandra said Mr Worsley’s death would be a “huge loss to the adventuring world”.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-endurance-crew-die>Did the Endurance crew die?</h2>
<p>Disaster struck when his ship, the Endurance, was crushed by ice. He and his crew drifted on sheets of ice for months until they reached Elephant Island. Shackleton eventually rescued his crew, all of whom survived the ordeal. He later died while setting out on another Antarctic expedition.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-endurance-sail-to-south-georgia-island>Why did the Endurance sail to South Georgia island?</h2>
<p>Elephant Island was an inhospitable place that offered little hope of rescue. Shackleton knew that in order for his men to survive he would need to reach the larger island of South Georgia to the northeast where whaling stations could offer assistance.</p>
<h2 id=do-humans-live-on-south-georgia>Do humans live on South Georgia?</h2>
<p>South Georgia has an average population of only 30 people, but none of them are native, and they are not considered to be permanent inhabitants. Two-thirds of these residents live in Grytviken, with the remainder being British Antarctic Survey (BAS) team members who live in King Edwards Point.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-ernest-shackleton-get-to-south-georgia-island>How did Ernest Shackleton get to South Georgia Island?</h2>
<p>The crew escaped by camping on the sea ice until it disintegrated, then by launching the lifeboats to reach Elephant Island and ultimately South Georgia Island, a stormy ocean voyage of 720 nautical miles (1,330 km; 830 mi) and Shackleton’s most famous exploit.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-ernest-shackleton-go-to-find-help>Where did Ernest Shackleton go to find help?</h2>
<p>Ernest Shackleton (1874 – 1922) In April 1916, they set off in three small boats, eventually reaching Elephant Island. Taking five crew members, Shackleton went to find help. In a small boat, the six men spent 16 days crossing 1,300 km of ocean to reach South Georgia and then trekked across the island to a whaling station.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-object-of-shackletons-expedition>What was the main object of Shackleton’s expedition?</h2>
<p>After the conquest of the South Pole by Amundsen who, by a narrow margin of a few weeks, was in advance of the British Expedition under Scott, there remained but one great main object of Antarctic journeying – the crossing of the South Polar continent from sea to sea. Kerr, A. J. – Second Engineer</p>
<h2 id=how-did-ernest-shackletons-crew-survive-in-antarctica>How did Ernest Shackleton’s crew survive in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>The men on the British expedition to Antarctica endured entrapment, hunger, frigid weather, angry seas—and near madness. All year, the ship had been trapped, the ice pushing and pinching the hull, the wood howling in protest.</p>
