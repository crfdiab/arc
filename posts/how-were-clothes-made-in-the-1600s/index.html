<h2 id=how-were-clothes-made-in-the-1600s>How were clothes made in the 1600s?</h2>
<p>In the 16th-century women wore a kind of petticoat called a smock or shift or chemise made of linen or wool and a wool dress over it. A woman’s dress was made of two parts, a bodice, and a skirt. Sleeves were held on with laces and could be detached. Working women wore a linen apron.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-clothing-made-of-in-the-16th-century>What was clothing made of in the 16th century?</h2>
<p>Women’s fashions of the early 16th century consisted of a long gown, usually with sleeves, worn over a kirtle or undergown, with a linen chemise or smock worn next to the skin. The high-waisted gown of the late medieval period evolved in several directions in different parts of Europe.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-cloth-originally-made>How was cloth originally made?</h2>
<p>The first clothes were made from natural elements: animal skin, fur, grass, leaves, bone, and shells. When settled neolithic cultures discovered the advantages of woven fibers over animal hides, the making of cloth, drawing on basketry techniques, emerged as one of humankind’s fundamental technologies.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-clothes-made-in-the-1500s>How were clothes made in the 1500s?</h2>
<p>Most people in the Middle Ages wore woollen clothing, with undergarments (if any) made of linen. Among the peasantry, wool was generally shorn from the sheep and spun into the thread for the cloth by the women of the family. Dyed fabric would fade if it was not mixed with a mordant. …</p>
<h2 id=who-influenced-fashion-in-the-16th-century>Who influenced fashion in the 16th century?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the single biggest factor influencing fashion in the sixteenth century was the wealth of European kingdoms and powerful city-states in Italy. Trade and exploration had led to a boom in the economies of Europe, and the textile, or fabric, industries were at the center of that boom.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-wear-in-16th-century-italy>What did people wear in 16th century Italy?</h2>
<p>Sixteenth-century men dressed down to display seriousness and sobriety. Men’s tunics, jackets, and stockings were generally tailored from black or dark brown luxury fabrics like velvet or silk. Women’s clothing, however, offered more complexity and variety throughout the Renaissance.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-rich-wear-in-medieval-times>What did the rich wear in medieval times?</h2>
<p>Towards the end of the Middle Ages, men of the wealthy classes sported hose and a jacket, often with pleating or skirting, or a tunic with a surcoat. Women wore flowing gowns and elaborate headwear, ranging from headdresses shaped like hearts or butterflies to tall steeple caps and Italian turbans.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-clothing-like-in-the-16th-and-17th-centuries>What was clothing like in the 16th and 17th centuries?</h2>
<p>Basic construction of clothing in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries differed drastically from the approach used in modern clothing construction in three basic ways. The first, and most obvious difference was that everything was sewn by hand.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-wool-used-to-make-clothes-in-medieval-times>How was wool used to make clothes in medieval times?</h2>
<p>Shorter fibers would be further sorted by grade into heavier and finer wools; the heavier ones would be used to make thicker yarn for the warp threads in the loom, and the lighter ones would be used for the wefts. Cleansing Next, the wool was washed; soap and water would usually do for worsteds.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-cloth-did-the-cloth-merchants-use>What kind of cloth did the cloth merchants use?</h2>
<p>Most cloth was made from either wool or cotton, but other materials such as silk and flax were also used. The woven cloth was sold to merchants called clothiers who visited the village with their trains of pack-horses. The clothiers then took the finished cloth to the nearest market town.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-material-was-used-to-make-cloth>What kind of material was used to make cloth?</h2>
<p>Most of the work was carried out in the home and was often combined with farming. Most cloth was made from either wool or cotton, but other materials such as silk and flax were also used. The woven cloth was sold to merchants called clothiers who visited the village with their trains of pack-horses.</p>
