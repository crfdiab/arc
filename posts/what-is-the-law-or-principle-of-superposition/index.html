<h2 id=what-is-the-law-or-principle-of-superposition>What is the Law or principle of superposition?</h2>
<p>Law of superposition, a major principle of stratigraphy stating that within a sequence of layers of sedimentary rock, the oldest layer is at the base and that the layers are progressively younger with ascending order in the sequence.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-law-of-superposition-a-law>Why is the Law of Superposition a Law?</h2>
<p>The Law of Superposition merely states that in an undisturbed succession of layers of sedimentary rock, the layer on top is geologically younger than the layer below it. The Law of Superposition is subsumed by the Law of Gravity, and the Law of Gravity is as universal a scientific law as one can wish for.</p>
<h2 id=in-what-circumstance-are-you-most-likely-to-find-older-rock-strata-atop-younger-rock-strata>In what circumstance are you most likely to find older rock strata atop younger rock strata?</h2>
<p>thrust faulting<br>
However, the most common mechanism to produce older rocks on top of younger is by thrust faulting. Thrust faults form where rocks are being compressed, usually by plate tectonic mechanisms. Thrust faults rip up older strata and pile it on top of younger rocks.</p>
<h2 id=which-layer-of-rocks-are-considered-the-oldest-according-to-the-law-of-superposition>Which layer of rocks are considered the oldest according to the Law of Superposition?</h2>
<p>layer 1<br>
*The Law of Superposition is that an undeformed sedimentary rock layer is older than the layers about it and younger than the layers below it. According to the Law of Superposition, layer 1 was the first layer deposited, and thus the oldest layer.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-law-of-horizontality>What is the law of horizontality?</h2>
<p>Basic Geologic Laws The LAW OF ORIGINAL HORIZONTALITY states that a series of sedimentary layers will generally be deposited in horizontal layers. You might think of this like snow falling one day when it is not windy, and it blanketing the ground.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-example-of-the-law-of-superposition>What is an example of the Law of Superposition?</h2>
<p>Layer upon layer of rocks on north shore of Isfjord, Svalbard, Norway. Since there is no overturning, the rock at the bottom is older than the rock on the top by the Law of Superposition.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-law-of-superposition-always-true>Is the law of superposition always true?</h2>
<p>When it’s in a pile, it’s not in equilibrium, and gravity will push on it until it is flat and all grains are experiencing the same amount of gravity, hence, horizontal layers, and so the law of superposition applies. SO no, sedimentary layers that have not been deformed cannot be deposited vertically.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-youngest-rock-layer-explain>What is the youngest rock layer explain?</h2>
<p>Claim (Write a sentence in your own words defining the law of superposition and fossils). The law of superposition states that rock strata (layers) farthest from the ground surface are the oldest (formed first) and rock strata (layers) closest to the ground surface are the youngest (formed most recently).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-youngest-rock-layer>What is the youngest rock layer?</h2>
<p>The law of superposition states that rock strata (layers) farthest from the ground surface are the oldest (formed first) and rock strata (layers) closest to the ground surface are the youngest (formed most recently). A fossil is the remains or traces of plants and animals that lived long ago.</p>
<h2 id=which-lettered-rock-layer-is-the-youngest>Which lettered rock layer is the youngest?</h2>
<p>Layer D<br>
Layer D is the youngest rock and layer A is the oldest.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-law-of-superposition-place-rock-strata>Where does the law of superposition place rock strata?</h2>
<p>The law of Superposition suggests that older rock strata are at the bottom, and younger rock strata are at the top.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-older-rock-strata-and-younger-rock-strata>Where are older rock strata and younger rock strata?</h2>
<p>The law of suggests that older rock strata are at the bottom, and younger rock strata are at the top. The law of Superposition suggests that older rock strata are at the bottom, and younger rock strata are at the top. Log in for more information. This answer has been confirmed as correct and helpful.

<h2 id=why-do-geologists-use-sequences-of-rock-strata>Why do Geologists use sequences of rock strata?</h2>
<p>Geologists also use sequences of rock strata to determine the ages of different beds relative to one another. Older beds are at the bottom of a stack of layers, assuming they have not been tipped over! Rock strata refers to stacked-up layers of sedimentary rock.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-youngest-strata-on-the-earth>Where are the youngest strata on the Earth?</h2>
<p>The youngest strata are at the top and the oldest are at the bottom. Sediment continues to spread in a flat plane until it hits an edge or runs out of material. If there is a fracture or intrusive feature seen in rock strata, it is younger than the rock strata.</p>
