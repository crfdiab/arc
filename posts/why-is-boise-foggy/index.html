<h2 id=why-is-boise-foggy>Why is Boise foggy?</h2>
<p>Stagnant weather conditions have trapped local pollutants in the skies over the Treasure Valley, creating a thickening haze over Boise. That’s when colder air is trapped in the Valley and keeps pollutants from cars, outdoor burning and fireplaces from mixing out and dispersing.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-air-so-bad-in-boise-today>Why is the air so bad in Boise today?</h2>
<p>Emissions from vehicles and industry are the most common cause of the poor air quality in Boise during temperature inversions. While some emissions drift into the area from eastern Oregon, the bulk of the air pollutants that get trapped during inversions originate in the Treasure Valley itself.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-air-so-bad-in-idaho>Why is the air so bad in Idaho?</h2>
<p>Idaho air quality is getting worse, and the state is now home to several of the top 25 most polluted areas in the country, the American Lung Association’s 2019 “State of the Air” report finds. Much of the drop in air quality is caused by wildfires, which are increasing as a result of climate change.</p>
<h2 id=does-boise-have-a-water-problem>Does Boise have a water problem?</h2>
<p>Water precipitation was down 1.4 inches from last year, totaling a mere 8.25 inches in Boise. “We are taking this very seriously and we are starting to do some long-term planning to address these concerns,” said John Roldan, the strategic water manager for the city of Boise.</p>

<h2 id=can-i-drink-the-tap-water-in-idaho>Can I drink the tap water in Idaho?</h2>

<h2 id=does-boise-tap-water-have-fluoride>Does Boise tap water have fluoride?</h2>
<p>Although no supplemental fluoride is added to the water, Fluoride is a naturally-occurring element in the Boise area.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-air-quality-in-boise-idaho>How is the air quality in Boise Idaho?</h2>
<p>There are so many. Instead, here’s a list of things that as of right now, completely suck. Boise’s air quality is horrible in Winter. “Due to topography and weather patterns, the Treasure Valley is subject to some of the most severe wintertime inversions in the intermountain West.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-people-in-boise-idaho>Why are there so many people in Boise Idaho?</h2>
<p>To many, they also symbolize how Boise is changing too fast. “People are concerned the city is trying to throw gas on the fire of growth,” says Crow. “People think they’re taking any opportunity to grow Boise.” Boise has experienced booms and busts before, especially during the ’80s and late ’90s.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-snow-does-boise-idaho-get-in-a-year>How much snow does Boise Idaho get in a year?</h2>
<p>Snowfall at Boise averages around 20 inches per year but can vary from a low of only a few inches to 30 to 40 inches. With milder temperatures frequently in the Treasure Valley during the winter, snowfall is not as great as in other mid-latitude locations.</p>

Even though the Treasure Valley is the home to over 700,000 people, the population density in Boise is surprisingly low.</p>
