<h2 id=which-greek-city-had-direct-democracy>Which Greek city had direct democracy?</h2>
<p>Athens<br>
The first known democracy in the world was in Athens. Athenian democracy developed around the fifth century B.C.E. The Greek idea of democracy was different from present-day democracy because, in Athens, all adult citizens were required to take an active part in the government.</p>

<p>state of Athens<br>
Thousands of years later, in the 6th century BCE, a relatively democratic form of government was introduced in the city-state of Athens by Cleisthenes.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-athens-called-a-democracy>Why were Athens called a democracy?</h2>
<p>Athens was called a democracy because every citizen could take part in the city’s government. Laws had to be approved by the assembly. Every citizen was part of the assembly, which debated and voted on all laws.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-first-greek-city-to-implement-democracy>Which is the first Greek city to implement democracy?</h2>
<p>Athens was not the first Greek city-state to implement democracy. Athens was far from the first Greek city-state to try to implement democracy. The city-state of Sparta also functioned as a form of democracy, between 50 to 200 years before its Athenian rival.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-democracy-in-the-world>Where was the first democracy in the world?</h2>
<p>In addition, it supports the idea that the people can replace their government through peaceful transfers of power rather than violent uprising or revolution. Thus, a key part of democracy is that the people have a voice. The first known democracy in the world was in Athens. Athenian democracy developed around the fifth century B.C.E.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-direct-democracy-work-in-athens-brainly>Why did direct democracy work in Athens Brainly?</h2>
<p>Democracy in Athens was started largely thanks to the philosopher and politician Pericles. He dominated Athenian politics and ruled by wise influence and negotiation. Pericles believed that all citizens should partake in government and was the first to offer a stipend to men in office. Why did direct democracy work in Athens Brainly?</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-golden-age-of-democracy-end-in-athens>When did the Golden Age of democracy end in Athens?</h2>
<p>Athenian democracy was short-lived. But this Golden Age was short lived, and after suffering considerable loss during the Peloponnesian War, Athens, and the rest of Greece, was conquered by the kingdom of Macedonia in the 4th century BC, leading to the decline of its democratic regime.</p>
