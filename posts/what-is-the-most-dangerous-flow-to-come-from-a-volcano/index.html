<h2 id=what-is-the-most-dangerous-flow-to-come-from-a-volcano>What is the most dangerous flow to come from a volcano?</h2>
<p>pyroclastic flow<br>
A pyroclastic flow is a hot (typically >800 °C, or >1,500 °F ), chaotic mixture of rock fragments, gas, and ash that travels rapidly (tens of meters per second) away from a volcanic vent or collapsing flow front. Pyroclastic flows can be extremely destructive and deadly because of their high temperature and mobility.</p>
<h2 id=how-dangerous-are-pyroclastic-flows>How dangerous are pyroclastic flows?</h2>
<p>Pyroclastic flows are so fast and so hot that they can knock down, shatter, bury, or burn anything in their path. Even small flows can destroy buildings, flatten forests, and scorch farmland. When pyroclastic flows mix with water, they create dangerous liquid landslides called lahars.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-least-deadly-type-of-volcanic-hazard>Which is the least deadly type of volcanic hazard?</h2>
<p>One type of volcanic hazard that most people think of first is lava flow, which is the flow of hot molten rock. Yet a lava flow is one of the least deadly of all of the volcanic processes. This is partly because lava flows do not, for the most part, move very fast.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-hazards-associated-with-a-volcano-eruption>What are the hazards associated with a volcano eruption?</h2>
<p>The list of hazards associated with volcanic eruptions is long and varied: lava flows, explosions, toxic gas clouds, ash falls, pyroclastic flows, avalanches, tsunamis, and mudflows.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-composite-volcanoes-the-most-dangerous-volcanoes>Why are composite volcanoes the most dangerous volcanoes?</h2>
<p>Composite volcanoes are believed to kill the most people because of their deadly nature and high numbers. Apart from their dangerous side, composite volcanoes are also famous because they comprise some of the most beautiful mountains on planet Earth.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-a-volcano-that-is-no-longer-active>What do you call a volcano that is no longer active?</h2>
<p>DORMANT VOLCANO – A dormant volcano is one that has not erupted for many years, although there is still some activity deep inside. EXTINCT VOLCANO – An extinct volcano is a volcano that is no longer active. GEYSERS – Geysers are springs that throw boiling water high in the air.</p>
