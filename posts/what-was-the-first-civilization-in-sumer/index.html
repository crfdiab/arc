<h2 id=what-was-the-first-civilization-in-sumer>What was the first civilization in Sumer?</h2>
<p>Let’s start with Sumer. We believe Sumerian civilization first took form in southern Mesopotamia around 4000 BCE—or 6000 years ago—which would make it the first urban civilization in the region.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-sumerians-and-what-civilization-did-they-live-in>Who were the Sumerians and what civilization did they live in?</h2>
<p>The Sumerians were the people of southern Mesopotamia whose civilization flourished between c. 4100-1750 BCE. Their name comes from the region which is frequently – and incorrectly – referred to as a “country”. Sumer was never a cohesive political entity, however, but a region of city-states each with its own king.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-civilization-of-sumer-divided-into>What was the civilization of Sumer divided into?</h2>
<p>Ancient Mesopotamia for Kids. A Class Society. The people of Sumer and the people of Babylon (the civilization that was built on the ruins of Sumer) were divided into four classes – the priests, the upper class, the lower class, and the slaves.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-civilization-was-the-sumer-civilization>What kind of civilization was the Sumer civilization?</h2>
<p>What Happened to Sumer? Sumer was an ancient civilization founded in the Mesopotamia region of the Fertile Crescent situated between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Known for their innovations in language, governance, architecture and more, Sumerians are considered the creators of civilization as modern humans understand it.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-sumerians-first-come-to-earth>When did the Sumerians first come to Earth?</h2>
<p>The list begins about 266,000 years ago, at a time when “Kingship first descended from heaven” in the ancient Sumerian city of Eridu in southeastern Iraq. Eridu is said to have marked the beginning of the Sumerian civilization around 5400 BCE and lasted until around 600 BCE.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-hindu-story-in-sumerian-civilization>Is there a Hindu story in Sumerian civilization?</h2>
<p>A Hindu Story in Sumerian Civilization. Hindus are the only ace in the world who never talk about any migration from any other part of the world. Sangam Tamil literature is also very open in saying that they belonged to a land between Venkatam (now in Andhra Pradesh, South India) and Kumari on the southern sea shore.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-city-of-sumer-get-its-name>Where did the city of Sumer get its name?</h2>
<p>Sumer was the southernmost region of ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq and Kuwait) which is generally considered the cradle of civilization. The name comes from Akkadian, the language of the north of Mesopotamia, and means “land of the civilized kings”.</p>
