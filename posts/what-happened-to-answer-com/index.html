<h2 id=what-happened-to-answer-com>What happened to answer com?</h2>
<p>In March 2017, Answers.com parent company, Answers Corp, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As of May 3, 2018, Answers.com abandoned their wiki format, according to Chris Hawkins, Vice President, Business Operations.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-ask-questions>Where can I ask questions?</h2>
<p>Herein find some best sites where you can ask questions and get answers from real people online.</p>
<ul>
<li>Answerbag.</li>
<li>Yahoo! Answers.</li>
<li>Blurt it.</li>
<li>WikiAnswers.</li>
<li>FunAdvice.</li>
<li>Askville.</li>
<li>Friendfeed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-wikipedia-brainly>What is Wikipedia Brainly?</h2>
<p>Brainly is a Polish education technology company based in Kraków, Poland, with headquarters in New York City. It provides a peer-to-peer learning platform for students, parents, and teachers to ask and answer homework questions.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-answer-of-life-the-universe-and-everything>What’s the answer of life the universe and everything?</h2>
<p>42<br>
The number 42 is especially significant to fans of science fiction novelist Douglas Adams’ “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” because that number is the answer given by a supercomputer to “the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.”</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-powerful-question>What is a powerful question?</h2>
<p>“Powerful questions are a reflection of committed listening and understanding the other person’s perspective that is confirmed through paraphrasing. Powerful questions are: • Open-ended questions with no hidden agenda.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-wikipedia>What is the purpose of Wikipedia?</h2>
<p>Wikipedia’s purpose is to benefit readers by acting as a widely accessible and free encyclopedia; a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-call-trusted-place>How much does it cost to call trusted place?</h2>
<p>However, unlike any other company, the deductibles at Trusted Place depend on the item that needs repair. For non-built-in appliances and electronics, there is a $125 fee, while for all the built-in appliances and home systems, there will be a $500 service call fee.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-mean-by-trusted-places-on-smart-lock>What do you mean by trusted Places on smart lock?</h2>
<p>I’m talking about Smart Lock’s Trusted Places feature, which lets you set a specific physical location — your home, your office, the ostrich habitat you for some reason frequent at your local zoo, or whatever — at which your phone will automatically stay unlocked.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-trusted-news-source-in-the-united-states>Which is the most trusted news source in the United States?</h2>
<p>The most trusted news source in the U.S. is the Economist — a venerable weekly magazine published in the U.K. — according, at least, to a recent survey conducted by the University of Missouri’s Reynolds Journalism Institute.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-trustworthy-news-outlet-in-the-world>Which is the most trustworthy news outlet in the world?</h2>
<p>Maybe it’s the accent. When it comes to news, in a world where “fake news” has become an ideological battle cry rather than an oxymoron, Americans deem British media outlets more trustworthy than their U.S. counterparts.</p>
