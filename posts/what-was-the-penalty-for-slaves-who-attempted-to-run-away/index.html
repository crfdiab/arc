<h2 id=what-was-the-penalty-for-slaves-who-attempted-to-run-away>What was the penalty for slaves who attempted to run away?</h2>
<p>Whites and free people of color who harbored runaways were subject to fines ranging between $100 and $1,000, or imprisonment for two years, at the discretion of the jury. Further study is needed, however, to determine how the laws were enforced and whether the punishment differed for accused blacks and whites.</p>
<h2 id=what-sorts-of-laws-did-northern-states-pass-with-respect-to-slavery>What sorts of laws did northern states pass with respect to slavery?</h2>
<p>Personal-liberty laws, in U.S. history, pre-Civil War laws passed by Northern state governments to counteract the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Acts and to protect escaped slaves and free blacks settled in the North.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-law-say-about-slavery>What does the law say about slavery?</h2>
<p>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights says in Article 8: No one shall be held in slavery; slavery and the slave-trade in all their forms shall be prohibited. No one shall be held in servitude. No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-many-escaped-slaves-flee-to-freedom-in-the-north>How did many escaped slaves flee to freedom in the North?</h2>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of slaves escaped using the railroad. She helped many slaves and put her life on the line for others. There were many other people like her too. So, to wrap up, the Underground Railroad was a system of secret passageways that helped slaves escape to the north.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-fugitive-slave-act>What was the purpose of the Fugitive Slave Act?</h2>
<p>The earlier Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 was a Federal law which was written with the intent to enforce Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution, which required the return of runaway slaves.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-federal-government-go-after-runaway-slaves>How did the federal government go after runaway slaves?</h2>
<p>Article IV of the Constitution required the federal government to go after runaway slaves. The 1793 Fugitive Slave Act was the mechanism by which the government did that, and it was only at this point the government could pursue runaway slaves in any state or territory, and ensure slave owners of their property rights.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-penalty-for-aiding-a-fugitive-slave>What was the penalty for aiding a fugitive slave?</h2>
<p>In addition, any person aiding a fugitive by providing food or shelter was subject to six months’ imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Officers who captured a fugitive from slavery were entitled to a bonus or promotion for their work. Enslavers needed only to supply an affidavit to a Federal marshal to capture a fugitive from slavery.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-punishment-for-providing-shelter-to-slaves>What was the punishment for providing shelter to slaves?</h2>
<p>Providing shelter and food was breaking the law and punished with a maximum fine of $1000 and up to a 6 month jail term. This law threatened the freedom of free and fugitive blacks alike as all slave hunters had to do was to declare orally before a federal or state judge that the escapee was a slave.</p>
