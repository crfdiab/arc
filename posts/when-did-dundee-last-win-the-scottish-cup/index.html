<h2 id=when-did-dundee-last-win-the-scottish-cup>When did Dundee last win the Scottish Cup?</h2>
<p>1910<br>
Throughout its long and proud history, Dundee Football Club has won the Scottish Cup on just one solitary occasion. The 1910 Scottish Cup Final therefore has lived long in Dark Blue folklore and at the time it was the first major trophy the club had ever won.</p>
<h2 id=has-dundee-fc-ever-won-the-league>Has Dundee FC ever won the league?</h2>
<p>Founded in 1893, they are nicknamed “The Dark Blues” or “The Dee”. The club plays its home matches at Dens Park. The club’s most successful era was in the 1960s when, under the management of Bob Shankly, Dundee won the Scottish Football League title in 1962, before reaching the semi-finals of the 1962–63 European Cup.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-bigger-dundee-or-dundee-united>Who is bigger Dundee or Dundee United?</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the cold, hard facts decisively prove that Dundee United have more fans, have won more trophies and earn more money than Dundee — and are, therefore, a bigger club.</p>
<h2 id=who-has-won-the-scottish-league-the-most>Who has won the Scottish league the most?</h2>

<h2 id=when-did-dundee-last-win-a-trophy>When did Dundee last win a trophy?</h2>
<p>League Cup (1946/47-present – 74th Season) In the League Cup, Dundee have been the winners on three occasions, in 1951–52, 1952–53 and 1973–74, they were also runners-up in 1967–68, 1980–81 and 1995–96.</p>
<h2 id=which-scottish-teams-are-catholic>Which Scottish teams are Catholic?</h2>
<p>Hearts and Rangers are the two Protestant clubs and Hibs, Celtic are the two Catholic clubs.</p>
<h2 id=are-dundee-united-catholic>Are Dundee United Catholic?</h2>
<p>You’ll have heard it all before — Hibs, for example, are a “Celtic team”, Hearts are a “Rangers team”; Hibs are “Irish” and “Catholic”, Hearts are “British” and “Protestant”. United are a mini-Celtic — “Irish” and “Catholic”; Dundee are a mini-Rangers — “British” and “Protestant”.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-dundee-fcwin-the-scottish-league>When did Dundee f.c.win the Scottish League?</h2>
<p>The club’s most successful era was in the 1960s when, under the management of Bob Shankly, Dundee won the Scottish Football League title in 1962, before reaching the semi-finals of the 1962–63 European Cup. The club would once again win the League Cup in the 1973–74 season, but have yet to win another major honour since.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-dundee-united-win-their-first-trophy>When did Dundee United win their first trophy?</h2>
<p>During the McLean era United won their first major trophies, lifting the Scottish League Cup in 1979 and 1980 and the Scottish Premier Division title in 1983. They were also successful in European competitions, reaching the European Cup semi-finals in 1984 and the UEFA Cup final in 1987.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-dundee-united-football-club-get-its-name>When did Dundee United Football Club get its name?</h2>
<p>For the similarly named club formed in 1893, see Dundee F.C. Dundee United Football Club is a Scottish professional football club based in the city of Dundee. Formed in 1909, originally as Dundee Hibernian, the club changed to the present name in 1923. United are nicknamed The Terrors or The Tangerines and the supporters are known as Arabs.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-goals-have-dundee-united-conceded-in-a-season>How many goals have Dundee United conceded in a season?</h2>
<p>(In season 1902–03 Dundee allowed 12 league goals against, which remains the fewest goals conceded by any British club in a full league season.) Dundee were also league runners-up in 1906–07 and 1908–09 finishing behind Celtic on both occasions, in 1908–09 by just 1 point.</p>
