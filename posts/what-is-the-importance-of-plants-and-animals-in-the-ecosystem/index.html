<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-plants-and-animals-in-the-ecosystem>What is the importance of plants and animals in the ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Plants and animals are part of a food chain, which keeps an ecosystem alive. Carnivores eat herbivores, which eat plants. When animals die, they decompose into the soil. Their nitrogen transforms into nitrate, which plants require for growth.</p>
<h2 id=are-plants-the-most-important-organisms-in-an-ecosystem>Are plants the most important organisms in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>hands down the most important organism on this planet is marine algae.” Phytoplankton are tiny microscopic plants – algae – that form the base of the marine food chain. Phytoplankton is most abundant in colder waters where there is an abundance of nutrients.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-plants-to-humans-and-animals>What is the importance of plants to humans and animals?</h2>
<p>Plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen from their leaves, which humans and other animals need to breathe. Living things need plants to live – they eat them and live in them. Plants help to clean water too.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-important-organisms-for-an-ecosystem>What is the most important organisms for an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Explanation: Green plants are producers so they are the most important organism in an ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-importance-of-animals-to-humans>What are the importance of animals to humans?</h2>
<p>Human uses of animals include both practical uses, such as the production of food and clothing, and symbolic uses, such as in art, literature, mythology, and religion. All of these are elements of culture, broadly understood. Animals used in these ways include fish, crustaceans, insects, molluscs, mammals and birds.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-small-animals-in-an-ecosystem>What is the role of small animals in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>They play a vital role in the ecosystem because the whole ecosystem gets shattered if the number of small animals are less and therefore, at a particular trophic level if a species becomes extinct then it will have a cascading effect throughout the ecosystem and will result in imbalance.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-plant-in-our-life>What is the importance of plant in our life?</h2>
<p>Plants are really important for the planet and for all living things. Plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen from their leaves, which humans and other animals need to breathe. Living things need plants to live – they eat them and live in them. Plants help to clean water too.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-organisms>What is the importance of organisms?</h2>
<p>Organisms are complex chemical systems, organized in ways that promote reproduction and some measure of sustainability or survival. The same laws that govern non-living chemistry govern the chemical processes of life.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-animals-and-plants-important-in-the-ecosystem>Why are animals and plants important in the ecosystem?</h2>
<h2 id=why-is-soil-so-important-to-an-ecosystem>Why is soil so important to an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Soil is a critical part of an ecosystem. It provides important nutrients for the plants in an ecosystem. It helps anchor the plants to keep them in place. Soil absorbs and holds water for plants and animals to use and provides a home for lots of living organisms.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-plants-important-to-all-living-things>Why are plants important to all living things?</h2>
<h2 id=why-is-the-atmosphere-important-to-an-ecosystem>Why is the atmosphere important to an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>It provides important nutrients for the plants in an ecosystem. It helps anchor the plants to keep them in place. Soil absorbs and holds water for plants and animals to use and provides a home for lots of living organisms. The atmosphere provides oxygen and carbon dioxide for the plants and animals in an ecosystem.</p>
