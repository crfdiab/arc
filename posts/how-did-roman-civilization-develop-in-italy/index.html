<h2 id=how-did-roman-civilization-develop-in-italy>How did Roman civilization develop in Italy?</h2>
<p>Where and how did Roman civilization develop? Rome developed in Italy. When Sicily fought Carthage, Rome got involved, leading to the Punic Wars. The Punic Wars were a series of three wars fought over 80 years, and the Romans were ultimately victorious in destroying Carthage.</p>

<p>With the unification of Italy, Rome was chosen capital of the country in 1870. Nowadays, it is one of the most visited cities in the world. The unification process of Italy started in 1848 and ended with the creation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-romans-come-from-before-italy>Where did the Romans come from before Italy?</h2>
<p>The Etruscans were perhaps the most important and influential people of pre- Roman Italy and may have emerged from the Villanovan people. They dominated Italy politically prior to the rise of Rome, and Rome itself was ruled by Etruscan kings early in its history.</p>

<h2 id=why-was-italy-important-to-the-roman-empire>Why was Italy important to the Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>The consolidation of Italy into a single entity occurred during the Roman expansion in the peninsula, when Rome formed a permanent association with most of the local tribes and cities. The strength of the Italian alliance was a crucial factor in the rise of Rome, starting with the Punic and Macedonian wars between the 3rd and 2nd century BC.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-rome-give-citizenship-to-the-italians>When did Rome give citizenship to the Italians?</h2>
<p>Following the end of the Social War in 88 BC, Rome had allowed its Italian allies full rights in Roman society and granted Roman citizenship to all the Italic peoples.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-city-that-rome-divided-into>What was the name of the city that Rome divided into?</h2>
<p>Some cities, called municipia, had some independence from Rome, while others, the coloniae, were founded by the Romans themselves. Around 7 BC, Augustus divided Italy into eleven regiones, as reported by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia: Roman Italia (in green) as organized by Augustus.</p>
