<h2 id=what-did-amerigo-vespucci-discover-on-his-first-voyage>What did Amerigo Vespucci discover on his first voyage?</h2>
<p>On May 10, 1497, explorer Amerigo Vespucci embarked on his first voyage. On his third and most successful voyage, he discovered present-day Rio de Janeiro and Rio de la Plata. Believing he had discovered a new continent, he called South America the New World. In 1507, America was named after him.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-amerigo-vespucci-set-foot-in-the-bahamas>When did Amerigo Vespucci set foot in the Bahamas?</h2>
<p>Later, in his third voyage to the western world in 1502, Amerigo set foot in the Bahamas. So, according to the dates of the two voyages, Columbus was the first man in the Colonial period who discovered America. But it was Amerigo who found out that the newfound land was America, not East India.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-amerigo-vespucci-call-south-america-the-new-world>Why did Amerigo Vespucci call South America the New World?</h2>
<p>Believing he had discovered a new continent, in a letter to Florence, Vespucci called South America the New World. His claim was largely based on Columbus’ earlier conclusion: In 1498, when passing the mouth of the Orinoco River, Columbus had determined that such a big outpouring of fresh water must come from land “of continental proportions.”</p>
<h2 id=when-did-amerigo-vespucci-go-into-the-service-of-portugal>When did Amerigo Vespucci go into the service of Portugal?</h2>
<p>But the Spanish government did not welcome his proposals, and at the end of 1500 Vespucci went into the service of Portugal. Under Portuguese auspices Vespucci completed a second expedition, which set off from Lisbon on May 13, 1501.</p>

<h2 id=where-was-amerigo-vespucci-born-and-died>Where was Amerigo Vespucci born and died?</h2>
<p>[Amerigo Vespucci was born in Florence in 1452 and died in Seville in 1512. He was employed in the latter city in the business house which fitted out Columbus’ second expedition. The following letter gives his own account of the first of the four voyages which he claimed to have made to the New World.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-obstacles-did-amerigo-vespucci-face>What kind of obstacles did Amerigo Vespucci face?</h2>
<p>What obstacles did Amerigo Vespucci face? On this journey Amerigo and his crew had some obstacles such as poor maps and navigational tools and inadequate supplies. Most explorers had this problem as well.</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload" data-no-lazy=1 data-origheight=433 data-origwidth=770 data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll height=433 id=_ytid_27082 loading=lazy src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nl1cLI48fto?enablejsapi=1&autoplay=0&cc_load_policy=0&cc_lang_pref=&iv_load_policy=1&loop=0&modestbranding=0&rel=1&fs=1&playsinline=0&autohide=2&theme=dark&color=red&controls=1&" title="YouTube player" width=770></iframe>
<p>It was in a letter that Vespucci described South America as “the New World.”. In 1538, when cartographer Gerardus Mercator was making his first maps of the New World, he decided to write “America” on both the northern and southern section. While this appeared to give Vespucci credit for lands that others had discovered, the term stuck.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-amerigo-vespucci-when-he-died>How old was Amerigo Vespucci when he died?</h2>
<p>The Italian voyager died on February 22, 1512, in Sevilla, Spain. He was 57 years old; the cause of death remained unknown. Only a few people were present at the funeral ceremony. In February 1931, the ship Amerigo Vespucci was floated off from Napoli.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-columbus-meet-amerigo-vespucci-in-seville>When did Columbus meet Amerigo Vespucci in Seville?</h2>
<p>In 1496, after Columbus returned from his voyage to America, Vespucci had the opportunity to meet him in Seville. The conversation piqued Vespucci’s interest in seeing the world with his own eyes. By the late 1490s, Vespucci’s business was struggling to make a profit anyway.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-amerigo-vespucci-do-after-lorenzo-medici-died>What did Amerigo Vespucci do after Lorenzo Medici died?</h2>
<p>In June 1503, when Lorenzo Medici died, a copy of Vespucci’s letter titled Mundus Novus was published. Amerigo Vespucci spent the last of his years fulfilling the role as Pilot-Major of Spain. He oversaw the training and licensing of Spanish pilots.</p>

<h2 id=when-did-amerigo-vespucci-go-back-to-portugal>When did Amerigo Vespucci go back to Portugal?</h2>
<p>In 1503, Vespucci set sail again under captain Gonzalo Coelho with the Portuguese flag. Along the way, they saw a variety of wildlife and met some more native people but no new discoveries were made. He returned to Portugal in 1504. This was Amerigo Vespucci’s final voyage.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-amerigo-vespucci-when-he-went-to-school>How old was Amerigo Vespucci when he went to school?</h2>
<p>Although Amerigo was twelve years older, they had been schoolmates under the tutelage of Giorgio Antonio Vespucci. Amerigo served first as a household manager and then gradually took on increasing responsibilities, handling various business dealings for the family both at home and abroad.</p>

<h2 id=where-did-amerigo-vespucci-get-his-early-education>Where did Amerigo Vespucci get his early education?</h2>
<p>While his older brothers headed off to the University of Pisa in Tuscany, Vespucci received his early education from his paternal uncle, a Dominican friar named Giorgio Antonio Vespucci. When Amerigo Vespucci was in his early 20s, another uncle, Guido Antonio Vespucci, gave him one of the first of his many jobs.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-more-important-amerigo-vespucci-or-juan-de-la-cosa>Who was more important Amerigo Vespucci or Juan de la Cosa?</h2>
<p>Contemporaries such as Vicente Yáñez Pinzón and Juan de la Cosa were arguably more important explorers and navigators. That’s not to lessen Vespucci’s accomplishments, which were considerable. He was a very talented navigator and explorer who was respected by his men.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-amerigo-vespucci-convince-the-king-of-portugal>How did Amerigo Vespucci convince the king of Portugal?</h2>
<p>Vespucci had earned a reputation as a skilled sailor and leader during his time with Hojeda, and he was able to convince the King of Portugal to finance a three-ship expedition in 1501. He had become convinced during his first trip that the lands he had seen were not, in fact, Asia, but something altogether new and previously unknown.</p>
