<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-invading-laos>What was the purpose of invading Laos?</h2>
<p>The objective: to sever the North Vietnamese Army’s main logistical artery, the Ho Chi Minh Trail, at its hub, Tchepone in Laos, an operation that, according to General Creighton Abrams, could have been the decisive battle of the war, hastening the withdrawal of U.S. forces and ensuring the survival of South Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-laos-become-colonized>How did Laos become colonized?</h2>
<p>It was established over the Siamese vassal, the Kingdom of Luang Phrabang, following the Franco-Siamese War in 1893. During World War II, the protectorate briefly proclaimed independence under Japanese occupation in 1945.</p>
<h2 id=was-laos-colonized-by-europe>Was Laos colonized by Europe?</h2>
<p>The modern nation-state Laos emerged from the French Colonial Empire as an independent country in 1953. Laos exists in truncated form from the thirteenth century Lao kingdom of Lan Xang. The borders of the modern state of Laos were established by the French colonial government in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-colonized-laos>What countries colonized Laos?</h2>
<p>Colonization by the French from the late 19th to the mid-20th century infused Laos with a European cultural element, which intensified throughout the country’s embroilment in World War II and the Indochina wars, as well as a civil war of its own in the second half of the 20th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-did-laos-gain-independence-from>What country did Laos gain independence from?</h2>
<p>Laos</p>

<h2 id=why-did-the-chinese-want-to-colonize-europe>Why did the Chinese want to colonize Europe?</h2>
<p>The Chinese for millennia had the means to accomplish similar feats but never did. What the Romans lacked in technology they could have invented if the demand for greater maritime exploration existed at the time.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-europe-colonize-africa-in-the-1880s>Why did Europe colonize Africa in the 1880s?</h2>
<p>Why Did Europe Colonize Africa? The 1880s mark the beginning of the colonial period in African history. While Europeans and Africans had established relationships in a variety of settings for centuries, the 1880s mark a major turning point in European attitudes toward Africa.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-western-europe-explore-and-colonize>Why did Western Europe explore and colonize?</h2>
<p>But neither they nor the Chinese felt the need to devote their resources to sea exploration as the Western Europeans did in the 15th and 16th centuries. The development of space exploration provides insight. Time and resources are scarce, and if given the choice, people would prefer to spend them in safe investments.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-muslims-want-to-colonize-europe>Why did the Muslims want to colonize Europe?</h2>
<p>Their success irreversibly gave them the advantage over their Islamic rivals and created the incentive for other European nations to challenge their supremacy. In the early 8th century, the Muslim Moors from North Africa conquered most of Iberia, nearly pushing the Latin-speaking Christians out of the peninsula.</p>
