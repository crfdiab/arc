<h2 id=why-did-east-tennessee-want-to-side-with-the-union>Why did East Tennessee want to side with the Union?</h2>
<p>Many slaves hoped that a Union victory would bring them freedom. East Tennessee’s loyalty to the Union came from its terrain and traditions. Because of the soil in that part of the state, East Tennessee landholders did not grow crops like cotton and tobacco that were labor-intensive.</p>
<h2 id=was-tennessee-a-union-or-confederate>Was Tennessee a Union or Confederate?</h2>
<p>On June 8, 1861, Tennessee seceded from the Union, the 11th and final state to join the Confederacy.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-tennessee-important-in-the-civil-war>Why was Tennessee important in the Civil War?</h2>
<p>During the Civil War more battles and skirmishes were fought in Tennessee than any other state except Virginia. Tennessee was like a gateway for both armies into the other side’s land. This is why so much fighting happened in Tennessee. More than 64,000 Confederate soldiers and 59,000 Union soldiers died here.</p>
<h2 id=what-event-led-to-tennessees-secession-from-the-union>What event led to Tennessee’s secession from the Union?</h2>
<p>Reaction to the attack on Fort Sumter With the attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, followed by President Abraham Lincoln’s April 15 call for 75,000 volunteers to put the seceded states back into line, public sentiment turned dramatically against the Union.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-tennessee-finally-secede>Why did Tennessee finally secede?</h2>

But after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April, and President Lincoln’s call for volunteers to fight for the Union, Tennesseans knew that war was coming.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-soldiers-fought-for-the-union-from-tn>How many soldiers fought for the Union from TN?</h2>
<p>Tennessee conflicts ran strong. While their neighbors and sometimes brothers fought for the South, some 31,000 Tennesseans joined the Federal army. Tennessee sent more white soldiers to fight for the Union than any other Southern state.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-tennessee-become-a-part-of-the-union>When did Tennessee become a part of the Union?</h2>
<p>Tennessee is Readmitted to the Union. The state legislature quickly met the preconditions for rejoining the Union and on July 24th 1866 Tennessee rejoined the Union. It would be another two years until Arkansas became the second to join.</p>
<p>Tennessee’s strategic location made it a prime target of the Union armies during the Civil War. It was, in fact, the only Confederate state that came entirely under Union control before the war ended. The invasion of Tennessee began early in 1862 when Federal land and naval forces under Ulysses S.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-tennessee-the-last-southern-state-to-secede>Why was Tennessee the last southern state to secede?</h2>
<p>Tennessee was the last of the Southern states to declare secession from the Union as a substantial portion of the population were against secession, but saw more than its share of the devastation resulting from years of warring armies criss-crossing the state.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-tennessee-readmitted-to-the-united-states>When was Tennessee readmitted to the United States?</h2>
