<h2 id=who-led-the-stamp-act-boycott>Who led the Stamp Act boycott?</h2>
<p>Patrick Henry<br>
Only 30 out of 116 Burgesses remained, but one of those remaining was Patrick Henry who was attending his first session. Henry led the opposition to the Stamp Act; he proposed his resolutions on 30 May 1765, and they were passed in the form of the Virginia Resolves.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-did-the-stamp-act-cost-the-colonists>How much money did the Stamp Act cost the colonists?</h2>
<p>Dice taxed at the rate of 10 shillings in 1765 would cost almost $54 in today’s dollar. Violating the Stamp Act was costly. A £10 fine in 1765 equals a fine of $1,073.38 in current dollars; A £20 fine would be the same as $2,146.77. These estimates are rough, but they help us understand what colonists were upset about.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-opponent-of-the-stamp-act>Who was the opponent of the Stamp Act?</h2>
<p>Stamp Act opponent Patrick Henry is known for his “Give me liberty, or give me death!” speech, delivered before a meeting of Virginia’s colonial leaders in 1775 in an effort to mobilize a militia against a possible attack by the British.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-members-of-the-stamp-act-congress>Who are the members of the Stamp Act Congress?</h2>
<p>Stamp Act Congress. The Stamp Act Congress was held in New York in October 1765. Twenty-seven delegates from nine colonies were the members of the Congress, and their responsibility was to draft a set of formal petitions stating why Parliament had no right to tax them. Among the delegates were many important men in the colonies.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-lieutenant-governor-during-the-stamp-act-riots>Who was the lieutenant governor during the Stamp Act Riots?</h2>
<p>On August 26, another mob attacked the home of Oliver’s brother-in-law—Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson. The rioters stripped the mansion, one of the finest in Boston, of its doors, furniture, paintings, silverware and even the slate from its roof.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-stamp-act-start-and-end>When did the Stamp Act start and end?</h2>
<p>Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The Stamp Act was passed by Parliament on March 22, 1765, with an implementation date of November 1, 1765. The ramifications of the Stamp Act affected almost everyone in the American colonies. The Stamp Act was in essence a tax on paper.</p>
