<h2 id=which-continent-does-not-have-volcano-or-earthquake-activity>Which continent does not have volcano or earthquake activity?</h2>
<p>Even though Australia is home to nearly 150 volcanoes, none of them has erupted for about 4,000 to 5,000 years! The lack of volcanic activity is due to the island’s location in relation to a tectonic plate, the two layers of the Earth’s crust (or lithosphere).</p>
<h2 id=where-are-earthquakes-and-volcanoes-not-found>Where are earthquakes and volcanoes not found?</h2>
<p>Earthquakes are found along all types of plate margins as shown on this map. Volcanoes however, only occur at constructive and destructive plate margins. A lot of volcanic activity occurs in the ‘ring of fire’.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-there-no-earthquakes-in-map-of-earthquake-distribution>Where are there no earthquakes in map of earthquake distribution?</h2>
<p>Answer Expert Verified Based on the map provided in the science 10 book page 11, there are no earthquake in large part of the pacific ocean, northernmost Asia (Russia), majority of Europe, in the middle and eastern region of South and North America. Some areas in Africa and Australia also have no earthquake.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-there-no-earthquakes-in-the-world>Where are there no earthquakes in the world?</h2>
<p>1 In the last five centuries, Malta has had only seven earthquakes. 2 When Andorra does experience earthquakes, they do not go over two on the Richter Scale, 3 Saudi Arabia has not seen any major earthquake or landslike in the past decade.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-smallest-continent-surrounded-by-water>Which is the smallest continent surrounded by water?</h2>
<p>Continent s are also surrounded by water, but because they are so big, they are not considered islands. Australia, the smallest continent, is more than three times the size of Greenland, the largest island. There are countless islands in the ocean, lakes, and rivers around the world.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-islands-that-are-still-part-of-europe>Are there any islands that are still part of Europe?</h2>
<p>The ocean flooded many low-lying areas, creating islands such as the British Isles, which were once part of mainland Europe. Some large continental islands are broken off the main continental shelf, but still associated with the continent. These are called microcontinent s or continental crustal fragments.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-least-populated-continent-in-the-world>Which is the least populated continent in the world?</h2>
<p>Antarctica is the fifth largest continent by land area, and the least populated continent. Antarctica is an island, and is completely surrounded by the Southern Ocean. The four continent model promotes the idea that all continents are landmasses divided by ocean.</p>
