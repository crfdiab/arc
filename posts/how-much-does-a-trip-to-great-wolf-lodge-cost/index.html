<p>With taxes and fees, the final cost was $341. That includes a room, water park passes for 6 people, and parking. Guests at the Great Wolf Lodge are able to use the water park on the day they arrive and the day they leave. That breaks down to $57 per person.</p>

<h2 id=has-anyone-ever-died-at-great-wolf-lodge>Has anyone ever died at Great Wolf Lodge?</h2>
<p>An incident at the Great Wolf Lodge in Williamsburg, Va., on June 19 involved a 4-year-old girl. Though she was rescued and revived, she died later at Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters in Norfolk, Va.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-drink-alcohol-at-great-wolf-lodge>Can you drink alcohol at Great Wolf Lodge?</h2>
<p>Yes, they have alcohol at Great Wolf Lodge. Even in the pool areas (indoor and outdoor)! You can get mixed drinks, wine and even Great Wolf growlers of beer. And I recommend not drinking and then going on the water slide.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-days-should-you-spend-at-great-wolf-lodge>How many days should you spend at Great Wolf Lodge?</h2>
<p>The most popular length of stay, according to Great Wolf Lodge company representatives (or “pack members”), is one day and two nights. That seems the wisest choice for avoiding sensory and budgetary overload as well. The water park is for resort guests only, and—important note—admission is included in your room rate.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-great-wolf-lodge-rates>Where can I find Great Wolf Lodge rates?</h2>
<p>GreatWolf.com allows you to view best available rates, compare alternate dates for travel, view room styles and packages. If you have questions, use the online chat assistance feature for an immediate answer. Bundle and save. Research package options that include meals and other amenities.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-get-with-a-paw-pass-at-great-wolf-lodge>What do you get with a paw pass at Great Wolf Lodge?</h2>
<p>The passes vary by location, but may include things like MagiQuest games and standard wands, ice cream, game cards for the arcade, and a Creation Station stuffed animal. Prices are different for the Paw Passes at each Great Wolf Lodge location because different activities and merchandise are included.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-ten-paw-bowling-at-great-wolf-lodge>How much is ten Paw bowling at Great Wolf Lodge?</h2>
<p>At just $5 at our location (at the time of posting), it’s a great way to spend some time out of the water. Ten Paw Bowling at Great Wolf Lodge is great for families, with it’s shorter lanes and lightweight bowling balls. Photo Credit: Jennifer Kaufman.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-with-kids-at-great-wolf-lodge>What to do with kids at Great Wolf Lodge?</h2>
<p>Consider celebrating your child’s birthday at Great Wolf Lodge. A variety of birthday packages are available that include room decorations, party activities, and birthday cakes (Allergy-friendly cakes are available if requested in advance.). Kids visiting the lodge will get special “birthday wolf ears” which signal the occasion.</p>
