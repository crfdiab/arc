<p>Although similar economic downturns in American history had been referred to as panics or crises, Manchester explained that Hoover believed that the word depression sounded less alarming.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-people-who-lost-their-jobs-during-the-great-depression>What happened to people who lost their jobs during the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>Over the next several years, consumer spending and investment dropped, causing steep declines in industrial output and employment as failing companies laid off workers.

<h2 id=what-did-the-unemployed-do-in-the-great-depression>What did the unemployed do in the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>In the United States, unemployment rose to 25 percent at its highest level during the Great Depression. Literally, a quarter of the country’s workforce was out of work. This number translated to 15 million unemployed Americans. There was no unemployment insurance to provide benefits to people who were without work.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-nickname-for-the-great-depression>What was the nickname for the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>The worst market crash occurred on a Tuesday, and that day earned the nickname Black Tuesday.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-the-shortage-of-jobs-lead-to-the-great-depression>How did the shortage of jobs lead to the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>A shortage of jobs in the Southwest led to the illegal deportation of 400,000 Mexican-Americans so that whites could get more jobs or government relief.
