<p>In the US, each of the 50 states has an official state seal which serves both an emblematic and a functional purpose. The seal of a state is representative of its history, origins, and ideals. It also functions as a designation that a legal or government document has been created or sanctioned under state authority.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-californias-state-food>What is California’s state Food?</h2>

<p>Around the bevel of the ring are represented thirty-one stars, being the number of the States of which the Union will consist, upon the admission of California. The foreground figure represents the goddess Minerva [Greek: Athena], having sprung full-grown from the brain of Jupiter [Greek: Zeus].</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-great-seal-of-california-adopted>When was the Great Seal of California adopted?</h2>
