<p>Longitude is the measurement east or west of the prime meridian. Longitude is the measurement east or west of the prime meridian. Longitude is measured by imaginary lines that run around the Earth vertically (up and down) and meet at the North and South Poles. These lines are known as meridians.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-imaginary-lines-running-east-and-west-that-measure-the-distance-from-the-equator-called>What are the imaginary lines running east and west that measure the distance from the equator called?</h2>
<p>The imaginary lines circling the globe in an east-west direction are called the lines of latitude (or parallels, as they are parallel to the equator). They are used to measure distances north and south of the equator. The lines circling the globe in a north-south direction are called lines of longitude (or meridians).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-imaginary-lines-of-the-earth>What is imaginary lines of the Earth?</h2>
<p>An equator is an imaginary line around the middle of a planet or other celestial body. It is halfway between the North Pole and the South Pole, at 0 degrees latitude. An equator divides the planet into a Northern Hemisphere and a Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-imaginary-line-that-separates-east-and-west>What is the imaginary line that separates east and west?</h2>
<p>The prime meridian<br>
The prime meridian, or 0 degrees longitude, and the International Date Line, 180 degrees longitude, divide the Earth into Eastern and Western hemispheres.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-imaginary-line-that-runs-north-and-south>What is the name of the imaginary line that runs north and South?</h2>
<p>The imaginary lines circling the globe in an east-west direction are called the lines of latitude (or parallels, as they are parallel to the equator). They are used to measure distances north and south of the equator.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-lines-are-used-to-measure-latitude>What kind of lines are used to measure latitude?</h2>
<p>Latitude is the measurement of distance north or south of the Equator. It is measured with 180 imaginary lines that form circles around the Earth east-west, parallel to the Equator. These lines are known as parallels.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-lines-north-and-south-of-the-equator-not-great-circles>Why are lines north and south of the equator not great circles?</h2>
<p>Other lines of latitude north and south of the equator are not great circles because they shrink as they move toward the poles. As their length decreases, they do not all pass through the center of the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-latitudes-and-longitudes-related-to-the-equator>How are latitudes and longitudes related to the equator?</h2>
<p>Latitudes are the progressive angular measurements north or south of the equator are the imaginary lines running from east to west on the Earth’s surface. While Longitudes are the measurements east or west of the Prime Meridian and run from the north pole to the south pole.</p>
