<h2 id=how-are-children-treated-in-south-africa>How are children treated in South Africa?</h2>
<p>Abuse of children is frequent in South Africa; young girls are neglected and abused even among their own families. Furthermore, children often suffer sexual abuse; the youngest children are the most at risk. In general, South Africa has the highest level of rape in the world.</p>
<h2 id=how-children-live-in-south-africa>How children live in South Africa?</h2>
<p>In mid-2017, South Africa’s total population was estimated at 56.5 million people, of whom 19.6 million were children under 18 years. Children therefore make up 35% of the total population.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-a-child-in-south-africa>Who is a child in South Africa?</h2>
<p>In this section ‘child’ means a person under the age of 18 years. This section gives children the right to a name, citizenship and some form of care. Children need food and shelter, and should be protected from abuse, neglect and degradation.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-12-rights-of-a-child-south-africa>What are the 12 rights of a child South Africa?</h2>

<h2 id=how-many-children-are-in-special-schools-in-south-africa>How many children are in special schools in South Africa?</h2>
<p>In 2015, according to government data, nearly 121,500 learners with disabilities were in “ordinary” schools. Over 119,500 learners were enrolled in special schools and, in 2017, close to 11,500 children with disabilities were on waiting lists to enroll in special schools.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-free-to-go-to-school-in-south-africa>Is it free to go to school in South Africa?</h2>
<p>Education in South Africa is not yet free for the majority of children with disabilities. South Africa’s laws do not automatically guarantee the right to free education, although most children who attend public schools do not pay school fees.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-dental-caries-treated-in-south-africa>How are dental caries treated in South Africa?</h2>
<p>The greatest need for the treatment of dental caries in South African children was for preventive services, restorations and extractions. The DMFT for the 12 year-old-group in South Africa decreased from 2.5 in 1982 to 1.1 for the current survey.
