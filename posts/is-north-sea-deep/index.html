<h2 id=is-north-sea-deep>Is North Sea deep?</h2>
<p>700 m<br>
North Sea/Max depth</p>
<p>The water volume of the North Sea is about 54,000 cubic kilometers (13,000 cubic miles). The maximum depth is 700 meters (2,300 feet) and average depth is 95 meters (312 feet) below the sea’s surface. The North Sea is the coldest sea in the world.</p>
<h2 id=which-ocean-is-north-sea-in>Which ocean is North Sea in?</h2>
<p>the Atlantic Ocean<br>
North Sea, shallow, northeastern arm of the Atlantic Ocean, located between the British Isles and the mainland of northwestern Europe and covering an area of 220,000 square miles (570,000 square km).</p>
<h2 id=can-you-swim-in-the-north-sea>Can you swim in the North sea?</h2>
<p>The North Sea is warm enough for swimming year round, and you rarely even have to cut a hole in the ice to do so.</p>
<h2 id=how-cold-does-the-north-sea-get>How cold does the North Sea get?</h2>
<p>The average temperature is 17 °C (63 °F) in the summer and 6 °C (43 °F) in the winter. The average temperatures have been trending higher since 1988, which has been attributed to climate change. Air temperatures in January range on average between 0 to 4 °C (32 to 39 °F) and in July between 13 to 18 °C (55 to 64 °F).</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-water-in-the-north-sea-come-from>Where does the water in the North Sea come from?</h2>
<p>In the Skagerrak, the North Sea water mixes with less saline water from the Baltic, and is transported north along the Norwegian west coast. Surface water temperature varies between 0 and 20 o C, depending on the season and the part of the sea, with less variation in the north. Salinity displays few variations in the open North Sea (32-34.5 ‰).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-salinity-of-water-in-the-north-sea>What is the salinity of water in the North Sea?</h2>
<p>The winter months see frequent gales and storms. The salinity averages between 34 to 35 grams per litre (130 to 130 g/US gal) of water. The salinity has the highest variability where there is fresh water inflow, such as at the Rhine and Elbe estuaries, the Baltic Sea exit and along the coast of Norway.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-waves-in-the-north-sea-different>How are the waves in the North Sea different?</h2>
<p>Surface and deep water currents may move in different directions. Low salinity surface coastal waters move offshore, and deeper, denser high salinity waters move in shore. The North Sea located on the continental shelf has different waves from those in deep ocean water. The wave speeds are diminished and the wave amplitudes are increased.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-north-sea-a-good-place-to-live>What makes the North Sea a good place to live?</h2>
<p>Its coasts and waters are still being colonised by new species from the Atlantic. The strong coupling between benthic and pelagic communities in the shallow parts of the sea makes it extremely productive and one of the most productive areas in the world, with a wide range of plankton, fish, seabirds and benthic communities.</p>
