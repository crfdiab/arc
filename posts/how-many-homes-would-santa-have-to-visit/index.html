<p>THE SCIENCE OF SANTA CLAUS Based on population figures, Santa will deliver gifts to 1.6 billion children. This requires visiting 5,556 homes a second and eating 150 billion calories in milk and mince pies. With an average of 2.5 children per household, Santa will need to make 640 million stops on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>80 million homes<br>
“While he takes advantage of emerging technologies,” Silverberg says, “Santa is, in many ways, a traditionalist.” Silverberg is not so naïve as to think that Santa and his reindeer can travel approximately 200 million square miles – making stops in some 80 million homes – in one night.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-santa-go-to-all-the-houses>How does Santa go to all the houses?</h2>
<p>Santa Claus has a magic key that he uses to get into homes, apartments, townhouses and condos without a chimney. He also uses this key for homes that have a chimney that is too small for him to fit down (too many Christmas cookies makes it a tight fit).</p>
<h2 id=how-many-kids-does-santa-visit-per-second>How many kids does Santa visit per second?</h2>
<p>There are just over 526,000,000 Christian kids under the age of 14 in the world who celebrate Christmas on December 25th. In other words, Santa has to deliver presents to almost 22 million kids an hour, every hour, on the night before Christmas. That’s about 365,000 kids a minute; about 6,100 a second.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-homes-does-santa-claus-have-to-visit-in-one-minute>How many homes does Santa Claus have to visit in one minute?</h2>
<p>In the time limit of every 1 minute/s on the Christmas day, Santa Claus has to visit 1 163 194.44 homes with Christmas trees ( one million and one hundred and sixty three thousand and one hundred ninety four .point forty four houses if, on average families on the globe were of 4 people ) to deliver all presents for the whole Earth.</p>

<p>THE SCIENCE OF SANTA CLAUS. Based on population figures, Santa will deliver gifts to 1.6 billion children.

<h2 id=how-many-times-does-santa-have-to-go-around-the-world>How many times does Santa have to go around the world?</h2>
<p>That would be enough to go around the world 60 times and is more than six times the distance between the Earth and the Moon. The researchers estimated that Santa will have to visit 5,556 homes every second this Christmas Eve to make sure every child gets a gift.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-households-does-santa-have-to-deliver-presents-to>How many households does Santa have to deliver presents to?</h2>
<p>All told, Santa has the responsibility of delivering presents to right around 500 million households, with a mean separation that rises to 0</p>
