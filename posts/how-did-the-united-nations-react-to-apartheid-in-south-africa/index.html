<h2 id=how-did-the-united-nations-react-to-apartheid-in-south-africa>How did the United Nations react to apartheid in South Africa?</h2>
<p>On November 6, 1962, the United Nations General Assembly adopts a resolution condemning South Africa’s racist apartheid policies and calling on all its members to end economic and military relations with the country. Nonetheless, opposition to apartheid within the U.N. grew, and in 1973 a U.N.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-other-countries-help-end-apartheid-in-south-africa>How did other countries help end apartheid in South Africa?</h2>
<p>These factors combined with growing pressure from the international community and de Klerk began to allow anti-apartheid measures such as legalising marches, political parties and, perhaps most significantly, freeing activists such as Mandela.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-international-community-say-and-do-about-apartheid>What did the international community say and do about apartheid?</h2>
<p>One of the primary means for the international community to show its aversion to apartheid was to boycott South Africa in a variety of spheres of multinational life. Economic and military sanctions were among these, but cultural and sporting boycotts also found their way in.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-international-community-respond-to-human-rights-abuses-in-south-africa>How did the international community respond to human rights abuses in South Africa?</h2>
<p>The international community responded to human rights abuses in South Africa by: arresting all of South Africa’s leaders.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-south-africa-kicked-out-of-the-un>Why was South Africa kicked out of the UN?</h2>
<p>The General Assembly suspends South Africa from participating in its work, due to international opposition to the policy of apartheid. South Africa was re-admitted to the UN in 1994 following its transition into a democracy.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-he-fight-against-apartheid>How did he fight against apartheid?</h2>
<p>At first, Mandela and his fellow members of the ANC used nonviolent tactics like strikes and demonstrations to protest apartheid. In 1952, Mandela helped escalate the struggle as a leader of the Defiance Campaign, which encouraged Black participants to actively violate laws.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-un-apartheid-blacklist>What is the UN apartheid blacklist?</h2>
<p>The U.N. blacklist is a protest against the South African government’s system of apartheid, in which the 24 million blacks have no voice in national affairs and the 5 million whites control the government.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-united-nations-condemn-apartheid-in-south-africa>When did the United Nations condemn apartheid in South Africa?</h2>
<p>On November 6, 1962, the United Nations General Assembly adopts a resolution condemning South Africa’s racist apartheid policies and calling on all its members to end economic and military relations with the country.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-botswana-and-swaziland-critical-of-apartheid>Why was Botswana and Swaziland critical of apartheid?</h2>
<p>Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland remained openly critical of apartheid, but had to rely on South Africa for economic reasons as a result of their geographical position. Many workers from these countries worked in South Africa on the mines, and there was a customs union between the countries.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-south-africa-not-included-in-the-united-nations>Why was South Africa not included in the United Nations?</h2>
<p>The South West African question was also on the agenda annually as from 1946. Initially the South African government responded to comments on its policy by saying that apartheid was part of the internal affairs of the country, and for this reason fell beyond the scope of the United Nations.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-anc-fight-the-apartheid-government>How did the ANC fight the apartheid government?</h2>
<p>Rebellion in rural areas such as Pondoland also erupted at this time against the controls of homeland authorities. The government reestablished control by force by mobilizing the army, outlawing the ANC and the PAC, and arresting more than 11,000 people under emergency regulations.</p>
