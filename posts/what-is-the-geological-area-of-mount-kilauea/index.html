<h2 id=what-is-the-geological-area-of-mount-kilauea>What is the geological area of Mount Kilauea?</h2>
<p>Established in 1961 and formerly a part of Hawaii National Park (established 1916), it occupies an area of 505 square miles (1,308 square km) and includes two active volcanoes—Mauna Loa and Kilauea—25 miles (40 km) apart.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-shape-of-kilauea-volcano>What is the shape of Kilauea Volcano?</h2>
<p>Kilauea volcano, a youthful shield volcano, sitting on the south east flank of the massive Mauna Loa shield volcano, is the youngest volcano (on land) of the Hawaiian hot spot and not only the most active volcano of Hawaii but at the same time also the world’s active volcano.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-plate-boundary-for-hawaii>What is the plate boundary for Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Most islands are found at tectonic plate boundaries either from spreading centers (like Iceland) or from subduction zones (like the Aleutian Islands). There are few ‘hot spots’ on Earth and the one under Hawaii is right in the middle of one of the largest crustal plates on Earth – the Pacific Plate.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-plate-is-the-pacific-plate>What type of plate is the Pacific Plate?</h2>
<p>oceanic tectonic plate<br>
The Pacific Plate is an oceanic tectonic plate that lies beneath the Pacific Ocean. At 103 million km2 (40 million sq mi), it is the largest tectonic plate. The Pacific Plate contains an interior hot spot forming the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-kilauea-so-active>Why is Kilauea so active?</h2>
<p>Activity at Kilauea is driven by the buoyant upwelling of a plume of hot mantle, which provides the heat to generate magma beneath the volcano. This magma has the potential to erupt from several different locations, or vents, on the volcano.</p>
<h2 id=is-mount-kilauea-near-a-plate-boundary>Is Mount Kilauea near a plate boundary?</h2>
<p>Hot spots are areas deep within the Earth’s mantle where heat rises up melting rock in the upper portion of the mantle. The Kilauea volcano is actually a mid-plate volcano and part of a hotspot chain which is a long line of volcanoes marking where the plate runs over the top of the slow-moving hotspot.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-crater-on-kilauea-volcano>How big is the crater on Kilauea Volcano?</h2>
<p>The Kilauea Volcano, or Mount Kilauea is a shield volcano located in a crater 3,646 ft (1,111 m) deep.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-lava-flow-from-kilauea-volcano>Where does the lava flow from Kilauea Volcano?</h2>
<p>Kilauea’s slopes merge with those of the nearby volcano Mauna Loa on the west and north. lava flow Lava emerging from an elongated fissure in Kilauea’s east rift zone during the volcano’s 2018 eruption. U.S. Geological Survey During the 19th century the main floor of Kilauea’s caldera went through several periods of lava filling and collapse.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-volcanoes-of-hawaii-located-on-the-plate>Where are the volcanoes of Hawaii located on the plate?</h2>
<p>The Volcanoes of Kilauea, Hawaii are on the middle of the Pacific Plate, thus created by Hot Spots. As you notice from the picture above, you can see that the Volcanoes of Kilauea, Hawaii are in the middle of the Pacific Plate, thus not able to be created by plate and their movement.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-major-feature-of-the-caldera-of-kilauea>Which is a major feature of the caldera of Kilauea?</h2>
<p>A major feature within the caldera is Halemaʻumaʻu, a large pit crater and one of Kīlauea’s most historically active eruption centers.</p>
