<h2 id=how-did-blue-ridge-mountains-get-their-name>How did Blue Ridge mountains get their name?</h2>
<p>The Blue Ridge, part of the Appalachian range, was created by the uplifting of the Earth’s tectonic plates 1.1 billion to 250 million years ago. The distinctive blue that gives this range its name emanates from its mountain forests which release hydrocarbons into the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=who-named-the-blue-ridge-mountains>Who named the Blue Ridge mountains?</h2>
<p>The English who settled colonial Virginia in the early 17th century recorded that the native Powhatan name for the Blue Ridge was Quirank.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-appalachians-form>How did Appalachians form?</h2>
<p>The ocean con tinued to shrink until, about 270 million years ago, the continents that were ances tral to North America and Africa collided. Huge masses of rocks were pushed west- ward along the margin of North America and piled up to form the mountains that we now know as the Appalachians.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-appalachian-mountains-get-their-name>How did the Appalachian Mountains get their name?</h2>
<p>That’s right, immigrants from Peru arrived in eastern North America about 800 years before the Itza Mayas of Mesoamerica. Yet, today, all of the published explanations and etymologies for Appalachian are wrong, except for my recently published, Native American Encyclopedia of Georgia .</p>
<h2 id=how-did-appalachia-relate-to-the-blue-ridge-mountains>How did Appalachia relate to the Blue Ridge Mountains?</h2>
<p>Appalachia was comprised of a complex mix of ethnic groups. The one common trait that bound them all together is that they were used to working hard and being self-reliant. So they had the intestinal fortitude it took to rough it out in the backcountry of the rugged Blue Ridge mountains.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-folk-hero-of-the-appalachians>Who was the first folk hero of the Appalachians?</h2>
<p>Daniel Boone, whose 1775 expedition through Virginia’s Cumberland Gap into Kentucky established the route for settlers moving west, became the first folk hero of America’s pioneer era. Eventually disagreements grew between the wealthy elites living in the lowlands and along the coast, and the more rural people of the Appalachian backcountry.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-people-lived-in-the-appalachian-mountains>What kind of people lived in the Appalachian Mountains?</h2>
<p>About 90% of Appalachian settlers in the 18th and 19th centuries were Scots-Irish (a.k.a. Scotch-Irish) descendants of Ulster Protestants, whose ancestors had migrated to northern Ireland from the Scottish lowlands.</p>
