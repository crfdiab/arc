<h2 id=what-act-is-after-the-townshend-act>What act is after the Townshend Act?</h2>
<p>The Townshend Acts’ taxation on imported tea was enforced once again by the Tea Act 1773, and this led to the Boston Tea Party in 1773 in which Bostonians destroyed a shipment of taxed tea. Parliament responded with severe punishments in the Intolerable Acts 1774.</p>
<h2 id=what-came-after-the-declaratory-act>What came after the Declaratory Act?</h2>
<p>The declaration stated that the Parliament’s authority was the same in America as in Britain and asserted Parliament’s authority to pass laws that were binding on the American colonies….Declaratory Act.</p>

<h2 id=why-were-colonists-angry-after-the-townshend-act>Why were colonists angry after the Townshend Act?</h2>
<p>Because colonists had opposed the direct tax imposed by the Stamp Act, Townshend erroneously believed they would accept the indirect taxes, called duties, contained in the new measures. These new taxes further fueled the anger regarding the injustice of taxation without representation.</p>
<h2 id=what-replaced-the-stamp-act-and-upset-the-colonists>What replaced the Stamp Act and upset the colonists?</h2>
<p>The British government coupled the repeal of the Stamp Act with the Declaratory Act, a reaffirmation of its power to pass any laws over the colonists that it saw fit. However, the colonists held firm to their view that Parliament could not tax them.</p>
<h2 id=who-passed-the-sugar-act>Who passed the Sugar Act?</h2>
<p>British Parliament<br>
The Sugar Act, officially titled the American Revenue Act, was passed by British Parliament in April 1764 in cooperation with Prime Minister George Grenville.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-townshend-act-go-into-effect>When did the Townshend Act go into effect?</h2>
<p>The Townshend duties went into effect on November 20, 1767. By December, two widely circulated documents had united colonists in favor of a boycott of British goods.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonists-protest-the-townshend-acts>Why did the colonists protest the Townshend Acts?</h2>
<p>In 1767, with the passage of the Townshend Acts, a tax on consumer goods in British North America, colonists believed their liberty as loyal British subjects had come under assault for a second time.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-women-boycott-in-the-townshend-acts>What did women boycott in the Townshend Acts?</h2>
<p>This verse, which ran in a Boston newspaper in November 1767, highlights how women were encouraged to take political action by boycotting British goods. Notice that the writer especially encourages women to avoid British tea (Bohea and Green Hyson) and linen, and to manufacture their own homespun cloth.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-in-the-townshend-acts>Who was the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Townshend Acts?</h2>
<p>Lord Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after whom the Townshend Acts were named, had died suddenly in September, 1767. Because of this, some scholars do not include the Vice-Admiralty Court Act with the other Townshend Acts, but most do since it deals with the same issues.</p>
