<h2 id=are-you-eligible-to-work-here-in-the-uae>Are you eligible to work here in the UAE?</h2>
<p>If you intend to work in the UAE you’ll need to be sponsored by an employer – you cannot work on a visit or a tourist visa. Once you’ve accepted a job offer your employer will apply for a residency visa on your behalf and you’ll then be able to get a work permit from the Ministry of Labour.</p>
<h2 id=are-you-legally-authorised-to-work-in-dubai>Are you legally Authorised to work in Dubai?</h2>
<p>All foreigners in Dubai need a work visa, known as a Labour Card, to work legally. It’s not uncommon for the authorities to seek out and prosecute or deport those working without a valid visa, so it’s important to have the right paperwork on hand.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-eligible-to-work-in-dubai>Who is eligible to work in Dubai?</h2>
<p>To be allowed to work in the UAE, you as well as the company hiring you must fulfill the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must be at least 18 years old.</li>
<li>The license of the company hiring you has to be valid.</li>
<li>The company must not have any violations.</li>
<li>The work you do must correspond to the nature of the company hiring you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-work-in-uae-with-visit-visa>Is it legal to work in UAE with visit visa?</h2>
<p>According to the UAE government’s official website – government.ae – foreigners planning to work in the UAE must know that they cannot work on visit visas or tourist visas. They need legitimate work or residency visas and permits to be able to live and work legally in the UAE.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-easy-to-get-a-job-in-uae>Is it easy to get a job in UAE?</h2>
<p>The good news is, if you’re employed by a Dubai company, they’re pretty easy to obtain. That being said, it’s possible to enter the emirate on a visitor or tourist visa for your job search and then transfer your visa status once you’ve found employment.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-need-a-degree-to-work-in-uae>Do I need a degree to work in UAE?</h2>

<h2 id=can-i-convert-visit-visa-to-work-permit-in-uae>Can I convert visit visa to work permit in UAE?</h2>
<p>Visit visa to Dubai can be obtained for 30 days or 90 days and it can be converted to employment visa or residence visa. Other than the visa fee a deposit is also required from the local sponsor, relative or any resident, which is refunded once the visitor successfully leaves the country in case of visit to UAE.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-live-in-uae-without-a-job>Can you live in UAE without a job?</h2>
<p>Since there is no way for foreigners to receive permanent residency or citizenship in the UAE, there is logically no true Golden Visa. However, through investment into the country, expats can receive 3-year, renewable temporary residency to live abroad long-term in Dubai without having to seek employment.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-days-it-will-take-to-get-work-permit-in-uae>How many days it will take to get work permit in UAE?</h2>

<h2 id=do-you-need-a-work-permit-to-work-in-the-uae>Do you need a work permit to work in the UAE?</h2>
<p>The primary requirement to be able to legally work in the UAE is obtaining a work permit from the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE). Even if you are eligible to work in the UAE, you would need to first get a work permit before you can be legally employed.</p>

<h2 id=whats-the-law-of-employment-in-the-uae>What’s the law of employment in the UAE?</h2>
<p>According to the UAE Labour Law or Federal Law No. 8 of 1980, there are two types of employment contracts: limited and unlimited contracts. While a limited contract is time-based and is usually linked to the UAE residency visa, an unlimited contract is open-ended.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-penalties-for-working-in-the-uae>What are the penalties for working in the UAE?</h2>
