<h2 id=why-do-they-call-it-capitol-reef-national-park>Why do they call it Capitol Reef National Park?</h2>
<p>ABOUT CAPITOL REEF NATIONAL PARK / WHERE IT IS: Once called “Wayne Wonderland,” the park got its name in part from the great white rock formations which resemble the U.S. Capitol building, and from the sheer cliffs that presented a barrier to early travelers.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-capitol-reef-made-a-national-monument>When was Capitol Reef made a national monument?</h2>
<p>1937<br>
Then, in 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt expanded the park’s acreage and declared it a national monument. Capitol Reef finally became a national park in 1971.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-unique-about-capitol-reef-national-park>What is unique about Capitol Reef National Park?</h2>
<p>What makes the landscape of Capitol Reef so unique is the presence of the Waterpocket Fold. This “wrinkle” in the landscape formed millions of years ago and caused the rocky landscape that inspired the “reef” part of the park’s name.</p>
<h2 id=who-lived-in-capitol-reef>Who lived in Capitol Reef?</h2>
<p>For hundreds of years, ethnohistoric nomadic groups such as the Ute, Paiute, and Navajo inhabited the area seasonally. Today, thirty-two tribes have an ongoing association with Capitol Reef through current and/or historical traditional uses.</p>
<h2 id=is-capitol-reef-worth-visiting>Is Capitol Reef worth visiting?</h2>
<p>Capitol Reef National Park is Utah’s quieter, smaller and lesser known of the epic ‘Mighty 5 national parks road trip circuit’. But that doesn’t mean it’s any less worth visiting than the other players in the game. This one day Capitol Reef National Park itinerary will help you plan your trip to perfection.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-rock-green-in-moab>Why is the rock Green in Moab?</h2>
<p>Oxidized iron results in red coloring and indicates a dry paleo-environment and reduced iron, produced in swampy or boggy conditions, gives the rock a green tint.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-the-waterpocket-fold>Why is it called the Waterpocket fold?</h2>
<p>The Waterpocket Fold defines Capitol Reef National Park. A nearly 100-mile long warp in the Earth’s crust, the Waterpocket Fold is a classic monocline, a “step-up” in the rock layers. The name “Waterpocket Fold” reflects this ongoing erosion of the rock layers.</p>
<h2 id=is-capitol-reef-worth-seeing>Is Capitol Reef worth seeing?</h2>
<h2 id=can-you-drive-through-capitol-reef>Can you drive through Capitol Reef?</h2>
<p>Capitol Reef Scenic Drive A road called the Scenic Drive winds through the heart of Capitol Reef National Park, allowing visitors to see many of the park’s famous formation. It also provides access to popular trailheads. The road is paved and is suitable for automobiles of all kinds.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-canyonlands-or-capitol-reef>Which is better Canyonlands or Capitol Reef?</h2>
<p>If you need to choose one or the other, Canyonlands wins hands down (there is a reason why Capitol Reef is not that crowded). I would even say that if you can add one more day to your trip, spending it in Canyonlands is still a better choice than going to Capitol Reef.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-should-you-spend-at-capitol-reef-national-park>How long should you spend at Capitol Reef National Park?</h2>
<p>Because Capitol Reef is such a compact park, it’s fairly easy to see a lot in a short time. Although 2 or 3 days in the park would be ideal, it is possible to have an enjoyable time with just half a day or so. Because there are no food services in the park (except fruit in season), pack a picnic lunch.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-capitol-reef-national-park-open-to-the-public>When did Capitol Reef national park open to the public?</h2>
<p>Capitol Reef National Park was initially designated a national monument on August 2, 1937, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in order to protect the area’s colorful canyons, ridges, buttes, and monoliths; however, it was not until 1950 that the area officially opened to the public.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-go-to-capitol-reef>How much does it cost to go to Capitol Reef?</h2>
<p>Capitol Reef National Park Entrance Fee Capitol Reef National Park, Utah, US. Entrance into the park costs $20 per vehicle or $10 per individual on foot or bike and passes are valid for 7 days. Holders of the America the Beautiful National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass enjoy free entry into the park.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-up-the-ground-in-capitol-reef>What makes up the ground in Capitol Reef?</h2>
<p>Biological soil crusts make up much of the ground cover in Capitol Reef National Park and play an important role in the park’s ecosystem. Soil lichen, mosses and cyanobacteria help protect the ground, prevent erosion, and help desert plants thrive.</p>
