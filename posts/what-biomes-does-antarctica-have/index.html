<h2 id=what-biomes-does-antarctica-have>What biomes does Antarctica have?</h2>
<p>Most Antarctic scientists would consider the tundra ecosystems to just be the “maritime climate” region of the Antarctic Peninsula in West Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands, and the rest of West and East Antarctica as polar or cold desert.</p>
<h2 id=what-mountains-does-antarctica-have>What mountains Does Antarctica have?</h2>
<p>The Transantarctic Mountains (abbreviated TAM) comprise a mountain range of uplifted (primarily sedimentary) rock in Antarctica which extend, with some interruptions, across the continent from Cape Adare in northern Victoria Land to Coats Land. These mountains divide East Antarctica and West Antarctica.</p>
<h2 id=does-antarctica-have-a-lot-of-mountains>Does Antarctica have a lot of mountains?</h2>
<p>While Antarctica does have high mountains, it is not because of its mountains that it has the distinction of being ‘the highest continent on Earth’: it is because of the thickness of its ice sheets.</p>
<h2 id=what-biome-is-in-greenland>What biome is in Greenland?</h2>
<p>tundra<br>
Greenland is made up of two biomes. The polar ice cap that is located in the center of the island, and the tundra that covers the coastline.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-a-lot-of-mountains-in-antarctica>Are there a lot of mountains in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>There are a large number of mountains in Antarctica. A listing of 2660 mountain peaks of the continent is available in the first link. The continent is home to some famous mountain ranges. The Transantarctic mountains are famous because they divide the continent into two parts: East Antarctica and West Antarctica.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-environment-does-a-mountain-ecosystem-have>What kind of environment does a mountain ecosystem have?</h2>
<p>Mountain ecosystem, complex of living organisms in mountainous areas. Mountain lands provide a scattered but diverse array of habitats in which a large range of plants and animals can be found. At higher altitudes harsh environmental conditions generally prevail, and a treeless alpine vegetation,</p>
<h2 id=where-are-polar-biomes-most-likely-to-be-found>Where are polar biomes most likely to be found?</h2>
<p>Polar 1 Very cold all year round. 2 Permanent or semi-permanent layer of ice. 3 Mainly found in the Arctic and Antarctic.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-highest-peak-in-east-antarctica>Which is the highest peak in East Antarctica?</h2>
<p>The Transantarctic mountains are famous because they divide the continent into two parts: East Antarctica and West Antarctica. Ellsworth Mountains are famous because they contain some of the highest peaks on the continent. The highest peak of Antarctica is Mount Vinson, which has an elevation of 4,892 meters.</p>
