<h2 id=what-month-is-the-sun-directly-overhead>What month is the sun directly overhead?</h2>
<p>The Sun is directly overhead at “high-noon” on the equator twice per year, at the two equinoxes. Spring (or Vernal) Equinox is usually March 20, and Fall (or Autumnal) equinox is usually September 22.</p>
<h2 id=at-which-latitude-is-the-sun-directly-overhead>At which latitude is the sun directly overhead?</h2>
<p>23.5°<br>
Having the sun directly overhead can happen only between the Cancer and Capricorn tropics. That is, only the places between 23.5° of latitude north and 23.5° of latitude south. On the Cancer tropic (23.5° latitude north) it will happen once every year, on the day of the northern hemisphere solstice (about June 21st).</p>
<h2 id=what-date-is-the-sun-directly-overhead-of-the-arctic-circle>What date is the sun directly overhead of the Arctic Circle?</h2>
<p>June 20-21<br>
June Solstice (Approximately June 20-21) The sun is 66.5 degrees off the zenith or 23.5 degrees above the horizon. Arctic Circle: It is light 24 hours a day north of the Arctic Circle (66.5 degrees north) on the June solstice. The sun at noon is 43 degrees off the zenith.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-sun-pass-directly-overhead-on-march-21>Where does the sun pass directly overhead on March 21?</h2>
<p>At this time, the sun appears directly overhead at 23.5 degrees north latitude, along the Tropic of Cancer.</p>
<h2 id=which-location-has-the-greatest-number-of-hours-of-daylight>Which location has the greatest number of hours of daylight?</h2>
<p>According to records from weather stations across the US, Yuma in Arizona is the sunniest place in the world. During daylight hours, which range from 11 hours in winter to 13 in summer, it has a 90% possibility of sunshine.</p>
<h2 id=which-season-has-the-shortest-daylight-hours>Which season has the shortest daylight hours?</h2>
<p>winter solstice<br>
The winter solstice occurs in December, and in the northern hemisphere the date marks the 24-hour period with the fewest daylight hours of the year. That is why it is known as the shortest day of the year, or the longest night of the year.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-sun-on-march-21st>Where is the sun on March 21st?</h2>
<p>Solution: On Earth’s equator, the celestial equator passes through the zenith. On March 21, the Sun is crossing the celestial equator, so it should be found at the zenith (90°) at noon.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-sun-directly-overhead-on-june-21>Where is the sun directly overhead on June 21?</h2>
<p>Having the sun directly overhead can happen only between the Cancer and Capricorn tropics. That is, only the places between 23.5° of latitude north and 23.5° of latitude south. On the Cancer tropic (23.5° latitude north) it will happen once every year, on the day of the northern hemisphere solstice (about June 21st).</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-sun-cross-the-local-meridian>When does the sun cross the local meridian?</h2>
<p>As such, it is the opposite of midnight. Alternative names include midday and noon time. In terms of solar time, noon is the moment when the Sun crosses the local meridian and reaches its highest position in the sky, except at the poles.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-sun-reach-its-highest-position-in-the-sky>When does the sun reach its highest position in the sky?</h2>
<p>Alternative names include midday and noon time. In terms of solar time, noon is the moment when the Sun crosses the local meridian and reaches its highest position in the sky, except at the poles. This version of noon is also called solar noon or high noon. Meridians and the Sun</p>
<h2 id=when-does-solar-noon-occur-in-your-city>When does solar noon occur in your city?</h2>
<p>This means that solar noon in western areas occurs later than 15:00 (3:00 pm) during some parts of the year, later than anywhere else on Earth. In many countries, Daylight Saving Time (DST) further increases the discrepancy between civil and solar time. When is solar noon in your city?</p>
