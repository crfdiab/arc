<p>Religion. The 2001 census showed the majority of the population claim to belong to one of the Christian denominations with 48% of these being Church of Scotland, 12% being Roman Catholic, and 5% belonging to other Christian denominations.</p>
<h2 id=is-falkirk-fc-pitch-artificial>Is Falkirk FC pitch artificial?</h2>
<p>Joe Wallace – head groundsman at Falkirk FC has a range of SISIS machines to maintain the synthetic pitch. The pitch at the Falkirk Stadium is not only used for training and match days by the first team, but it is also available to the local community and is a popular venue for concerts.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-falkirk-called-the-bairns>Why are Falkirk called the bairns?</h2>
<p>The club’s nickname is “The Bairns”, a Scots word meaning sons or daughters, which is given to natives of the town of Falkirk. This is reflected in the Falkirk Burgh motto: “Better meddle wi’ the de’il than the Bairns o’ Fa’kirk”.</p>
<h2 id=is-falkirk-nice>Is Falkirk nice?</h2>
<p>Falkirk is a very nice town and the people are friendly. It’s not rough and has to be one of, if not the, safest large town in Scotland. Commuting to Glasgow and Edinburgh is easy as there is good access to motorways and the train service to each from Falkirk High Station is usually very quick and efficient.</p>
<h2 id=is-falkirk-a-pitch-lawn>Is Falkirk a pitch lawn?</h2>
<p>Falkirk FC has appointed GreenFields to install an artificial pitch at the Falkirk Stadium. This will be one of the first new generation of woven synthetic turf systems to be installed in the UK. It is specifically designed for football and will have an enhanced appearance through the use of a green infill.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-scottish-football-clubs-get-their-nicknames>How did Scottish football clubs get their nicknames?</h2>
<p>The nicknames given by fans to the football (soccer) club they support have evolved since the game began in Scotland (the first Scottish Cup was played in 1873). Some nicknames are fairly obvious, such as “Saints” (for both St Johnstone in Perth and St Mirren in Paisley) or “The Rovers” for Albion Rovers.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-times-has-falkirk-been-in-the-second-tier-of-scottish-football>How many times has Falkirk been in the second tier of Scottish Football?</h2>
<p>As a result, Falkirk has won or finished runners-up in the second tier of Scottish football a record 14 times, the majority occurring in this period. The club also spent three seasons in the late 1970s in the newly created third tier, the lowest tier it has competed in.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-falkirk-fcget-promoted-to-the-top-division>How did Falkirk f.c.get promoted to the top division?</h2>
<p>Falkirk was promoted to the top division with a second-place finish behind Clyde after two seasons. Despite the club’s success, several months beforehand a proposal to merge with local rivals East Stirlingshire was raised, which was narrowly rejected in a vote.</p>
