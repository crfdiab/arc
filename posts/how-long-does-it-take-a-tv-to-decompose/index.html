<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-a-tv-to-decompose>How long does it take a TV to decompose?</h2>
<p>1-2 million years<br>
Electronic devices seem like they were made to resist decomposition … forever. The glass they might contain takes 1-2 million years to decompose.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-electronics-to-decompose>How long does it take for electronics to decompose?</h2>
<p>E-waste is on the landfill blacklist for a good reason. Electronic devices were made to resist decomposition, forever. The glass they might contain takes 1-2 million years to decompose.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-electronics-in-a-landfill>What happens to electronics in a landfill?</h2>
<p>However, most electronic waste still ends up in landfills or gets incinerated, wasting useful resources and releasing toxic chemicals and other pollutants — such as lead, mercury, and cadmium — into the soil, groundwater, and atmosphere to the detriment of the environment.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-items-to-decompose-in-a-landfill>How long does it take for items to decompose in a landfill?</h2>
<p>2-6 weeks<br>
Normally, it takes 2-6 weeks in landfills to get completely decomposed. But if we recycle paper items, we can easily save lot of landfill space, while reducing the energy and virgin material requirements of making non-recycled paper. By weight, food waste is the largest waste item in American landfills.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-pounds-of-garbage-does-a-person-throw-away-each-day>How many pounds of garbage does a person throw away each day?</h2>
<p>Californians throw away 6 pounds of trash every day, equivalent to almost 2200 pounds every year, roughly the weight of a subcompact car. These individual results more than double the state’s 2020 goal of 2.7 pounds per person per day (PPD).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-bad-to-throw-away-electronics>Why is it bad to throw away electronics?</h2>
<p>First, your old electronics are chock full of toxic stuff that should never make it to a landfill, like arsenic, lead, and cadmium. If those materials make it into landfills, they can potentially leak into our ecosystem, damaging plant and animal life and potentially impacting our food supply.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-old-electronics-not-used-anymore>What happens to old electronics not used anymore?</h2>
<p>After obsolete or unused electronics are thrown away as trash, two things can happen: the E-waste can either sit in a landfill or it can be recycled and used to create new products. In developing countries, the process of recycling e-waste is not properly regulated, and safe methods are rarely used.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-electronics-go-to-die>Where do electronics go to die?</h2>
<p>The world makes nearly 50 million tons of electronic garbage each year. And for decades, a lot of it has ended up in one town in China: Guiyu (gway-yoo). Every week, truckloads of dead electronics, or e-waste, get dumped in Guiyu.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-electronic-waste-to-decompose>How long does it take for electronic waste to decompose?</h2>
<p>E-waste is on the landfill blacklist for a good reason. Electronic devices seem like they were made to resist decomposition … forever. The glass they might contain takes 1-2 million years to decompose.</p>
<p>The contents of a landfill are a wide range of items, Some decompose i–2 months, others 5 years and some over 500 years.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-electronics-end-up-in-landfill>What happens when electronics end up in landfill?</h2>
<p>Many devices, especially computers, batteries and tube TVs, contain harmful materials such as heavy metals. When these unwanted electronics end up in landfills, they begin to leak out these toxic chemicals, endangering landfill workers, the landfill itself and often the surrounding community.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-old-tvs-and-computers-after-dump>What happens to old TVs and computers after dump?</h2>
<p>Many people will receive a new computer or cell phone this holiday season — and throw out their old equipment. And when old TVs and computers end up in landfills, the toxic metals and flame retardants they contain can cause environmental problems.</p>
