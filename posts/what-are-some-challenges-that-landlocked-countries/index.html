<h2 id=what-are-some-challenges-that-landlocked-countries>What are some challenges that landlocked countries?</h2>
<p>Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) face many complex challenges. Due to their geographic remoteness, their lack of direct access to the open sea and the high transport and transit costs they face, they are at a significant economic disadvantage compared to the rest of the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-disadvantage-of-being-a-landlocked-country>What is a disadvantage of being a landlocked country?</h2>

<h2 id=how-can-being-landlocked-affect-a-country-development>How can being landlocked affect a country development?</h2>
<p>Mackellar et al. (2000) argue that being landlocked reduces a country’s average growth by 1.5 % annually. Landlocked developing countries thus pay a high price for not having a sea port of their own. On average, it takes landlocked developing countries 42 days to import and 37 days to export goods.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-bad-to-be-landlocked>Why is it bad to be landlocked?</h2>
<p>Generally, being landlocked creates some political and economic handicaps that having access to international waters would avoid. For this reason, nations large and small throughout history have sought to gain access to open waters, even at great expense in wealth, bloodshed, and political capital.</p>

<h2 id=are-there-any-landlocked-countries-in-south-america>Are there any landlocked countries in South America?</h2>
<p>South America has just two landlocked countries: Bolivia and Paraguay . Europe has 14 landlocked countries: Andorra, Austria, Belarus, Czech Republic, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Moldova, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland, and Vatican City.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-landlocked-countries-different-from-maritime-countries>How are landlocked countries different from maritime countries?</h2>
<p>Overall, landlocked countries have lower levels of human development and external trade compared with their maritime neighbours. Nearly all landlocked countries export between twelve and seventy per cent less than maritime countries.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-countries-in-the-world-that-are-not-landlocked>Are there any countries in the world that are not landlocked?</h2>
