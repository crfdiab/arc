<h2 id=why-is-deforestation-happening-in-the-amazon>Why is deforestation happening in the Amazon?</h2>
<p>In the Amazon, around 17% of the forest has been lost in the last 50 years, mostly due to forest conversion for cattle ranching. Forests cover 31% of the land area on our planet. Deforestation is a particular concern in tropical rain forests because these forests are home to much of the world’s biodiversity.</p>
<h2 id=why-have-large-areas-of-forests-been-cleared>Why have large areas of forests been cleared?</h2>
<p>Reasons forests are destroyed Often, deforestation occurs when forested area is cut and cleared to make way for agriculture or grazing. Many forests are cleared to make way for palm oil plantations. Palm oil is the most commonly produced vegetable oil and is found in half of all supermarket products.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-large-areas-of-the-amazon-rainforest-being-cleared>Why are large areas of the Amazon rainforest being cleared?</h2>
<p>Large areas of the Amazon rainforest are continually being cleared in order to make room for agriculture. Additionally, roads are being built in the… See full answer below. Our experts can answer your tough homework and study questions.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-logging-of-the-amazon-affect-the-environment>How did the logging of the Amazon affect the environment?</h2>
<p>Vast areas of rainforest were felled for cattle pasture and soy farms, drowned for dams, dug up for minerals, and bulldozed for towns and colonization projects. At the same time, the proliferation of roads opened previously inaccessible forests to settlement by poor farmers, illegal logging, and land speculators.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-fires-in-the-amazon>Why are there so many fires in the Amazon?</h2>
<p>Sadly, the Amazon rainforest still continues to be lost rapidly. Many factors contribute to this, including illegal deforestation due to fires, exploitation of forest resources, and human encroachment. Tragically, around 75,000 fires occurred in Brazil’s Amazon during early 2019.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-dams-in-the-amazon-rainforest>Why are there so many dams in the Amazon rainforest?</h2>
<p>This is often viewed as renewable ‘clean’ energy, but it can involve flooding vast areas of rainforest. Dams built in rainforest areas often have a short life because the submerged forest gradually rots, making the reservoir water acidic, which eventualy corrodes the dam turbines. Rainforests are precious ecosystems.</p>
