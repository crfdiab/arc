<h2 id=why-renewable-resources-are-becoming-more-popular>Why renewable resources are becoming more popular?</h2>
<p>The increasing demand worldwide for renewable forms of energy challenges the dominance fossil fuels have in the world. More economies are finding efficient and creative new ways of producing and storing renewable energy to meet the rising energy demand of the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-renewable-energy-sources-were-given-a-lot-of-importance-now-days>Why the renewable energy sources were given a lot of importance now days?</h2>
<p>The combustion of fossil fuels for energy results in a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. Most sources of renewable energy result in little to no emissions, even when considering the full life cycle of the technologies. Renewable energy emits no or low air pollutants.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-problem-with-most-renewable-energy-resources>What is the main problem with most renewable energy resources?</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, the biggest problem with mainstream renewable energy is intermittency. Wind power is only generated when it’s windy, solar power is only generated when it’s sunny. This creates several fundamental issues. Here’s the thing about most renewable forms of energy: they’re horribly inefficient.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-a-concern-about-the-over-utilisation-of-non-renewable-resources>Why is there a concern about the over Utilisation of non renewable resources?</h2>
<p>We depend on fossil fuels because they are energy-rich and relatively cheap to process. But a major problem with fossil fuels, aside from their being in limited supply, is that burning them releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=which-one-of-the-following-is-not-a-renewable-resources>Which one of the following is not a renewable resources?</h2>
<p>Coal is a non – renewable source of energy. It takes thousands of years to form coal in nature. Additional information: Coal and petroleum are fossil fuels. They are formed by the fossilization of dead remains of plants and animals respectively.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-non-renewable-resources-in-the-world>What are the major non-renewable resources in the world?</h2>
<p>The major non-renewable resources include energy resources and metal-mineral resources. According to International Energy Agency (IEA), last 28 years (since 1971), use of global energy has experienced a massive growth of 70 percent, much more than the projected figures.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-a-crisis-of-renewable-resources>Why is there a crisis of renewable resources?</h2>
<p>To estimate the danger of renewable resource crisis Human Development Report warns: “The crisis of renewables, a major source of global poverty, endanger the livelihood of millions, especially the rural people who derive their livelihood directly from the natural environment around them.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-shortage-of-non-renewable-resources>Is there a shortage of non renewable resources?</h2>
<p>The world is now facing acute shortage of non-renewable resources. Dramatic increase of consumption of resources raised alarming signals to the existing resource base. The major non-renewable resources include energy resources and metal-mineral resources.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-percentage-of-renewable-energy-in-us>What’s the percentage of renewable energy in US?</h2>
<p>And the previously mentioned NREL study found that renewable energy could comfortably provide up to 80 percent of US electricity by 2050. Energy expert Paula Garcia talks about the growth of renewable energy across the globe and in the United States.</p>
