<p>Platypuses also live under rock ledges, roots or debris. Though they exist on only one side of one continent, platypuses weather many climate extremes. They have been found in plateaus, lowlands, tropical rainforests, and the cold mountains of Tasmania and the Australian Alps.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-platypuses-be-found>Where can platypuses be found?</h2>
<p>eastern Australia<br>
Platypus are found in eastern Australia from the steamy tropics of far north Queensland to the freezing snows of Tasmania. In Queensland, platypus live in rivers east of the Great Dividing Range, and are also found in some western-flowing streams. In north Queensland, the range of the platypus is close to the coast.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-platypuses-most-common>Where are platypuses most common?</h2>
<p>The platypus is common in waterways of eastern Australia, where it generally feeds on bottom-dwelling invertebrates but also takes an occasional frog, fish, or insect at the water’s surface. This shy creature forages most actively from dusk to dawn, sheltering during the day in burrows dug into stream banks.</p>
<h2 id=are-platypuses-aggressive>Are platypuses aggressive?</h2>
<p>Just because they are a little peculiar doesn’t mean you should let your guard down. They are more dangerous then you think! The male platypus has a spur on its hind foot that contains venom, which is lethal enough to kill a dog! This makes them one of the few venomous mammals on the planet!</p>

<h2 id=can-you-pet-a-platypus>Can you pet a platypus?</h2>
<p>Don’t pet the platypus. When British biologist Sir Everard Home got ahold of some platypus specimens in 1801, he told his fellow nerds at the Royal Society how the male specimen had a half-inch long “strong crooked spur” on the heel of each rear foot. The female, however, was spur-free.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-find-a-platypus-in-australia>Where can you find a platypus in Australia?</h2>
<p>The platypus is an egg-laying mammal found exclusively in eastern Australia, including Tasmania. The platypus has an extremely unique combination of features: it has clawed hindfeet, webbed forefeet, a tail that resembles that of a beaver, and a bill, like a duck.</p>

<p>Published November 21, 2019 The platypus is an egg-laying mammal found exclusively in eastern Australia, including Tasmania. The platypus has an extremely unique combination of features: it has clawed hindfeet, webbed forefeet, a tail that resembles that of a beaver, and a bill, like a duck.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-platypus-spend-most-of-its-time>Where does the platypus spend most of its time?</h2>
<p>Platypuses spend most of their time in the water. Platypus is a semiaquatic mammal that lay eggs. The common residence for this animal include the lakes and streams of eastern Australia. They can also be found in Tasmania. They are the one of the few mammals that reproduce by lay eggs, known as monotremes.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-the-oldest-platypus-in-the-world>How old is the oldest platypus in the world?</h2>
<p>To date, the oldest platypus fossil found is over 100,000 years old. The platypus differs from all other mammals in another way: it can send out electrical impulses to locate prey in deep waters.</p>
