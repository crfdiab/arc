<p>In the final four lines of A Psalm of Life, the poet Longfellow asks us to be up at once and start working. However, the poet here urges us not to mind the consequences, or, to make our mind prepared for any fate. We must carry on, reaching great heights, still not leaving.</p>

<p>A Psalm of Life: This poem is known for its optimism and the theme-right attitude of life. The poet gives out the message that pleasure or sorrow is not the goal of life.

<h2 id=what-is-the-poem-about-life-is-real-life-is-earnest>What is the poem about life is real life is earnest?</h2>
<p>Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returnest, Was not spoken of the soul. Not enjoyment, and not sorrow, Is our destined end or way; But to act, that each to-morrow Find us farther than to-day.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-theme-of-a-psalm-of-life>What is the main theme of A Psalm of Life?</h2>
<p>The main theme of the poem, as we can see, is to represent an optimistic view of life. According to the poet, this life is precious. We should not waste it. Rather, we should use this life to do something great, so that people remember us for ever.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-message-of-the-psalm>What is the message of the psalm?</h2>
<p>The psalm is a celebration of God’s sovereign protection. One of the main themes of the psalm is that God will get glory both from his people’s deliverance and those who oppose him being destroyed. God is eternal and has eternal power to match his word. He made heaven and earth, and can unmake them.</p>

What does the poem ” throw away the docile doctrine ” say?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The poem tells the reader to look at life with positivity and hopefulness. It asks the readers to throw away the docile, traditional biblical doctrine of life that has been taught and live life to the fullest.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-the-title-of-a-poem>Where can I find the title of a poem?</h2>
<p>This is a particularly good option when poetry seekers have no idea who the poet is but are sure of the title or a specific phrase. Even just a few unique words from the poem can help: and if you find it on a site you don’t trust, you may find more to inform your search, like the name of the poet.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-you-search-for-a-line-in-a-poem>What happens when you search for a line in a poem?</h2>
<p>When seekers have searched for the whole line in quotes and get nothing back, they may have misremembered the line. For instance, “fog comes in on little cat’s feet” locates two pages in which Sandburg’s poem is misquoted, but not the poem itself.</p>
