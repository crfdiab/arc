<h2 id=could-a-human-walk-on-the-sun>Could a human walk on the sun?</h2>
<p>The Sun is a fluid mass with no solid surface, meaning there is nothing really there to walk on. You would sink.</p>
<h2 id=how-close-could-a-human-get-to-the-sun>How close could a human get to the sun?</h2>
<p>Four million miles (or if you prefer, 6.44 million kilometers) is quite a distance. It’s the equivalent of driving around Earth’s widest point, the equator, 160 times in a row. Well that’s about as close to the sun as NASA is willing to take its new Parker Solar Probe (PSP).</p>
<h2 id=can-rockets-go-to-the-sun>Can Rockets go to the sun?</h2>
<p>But this is almost impossible with current rocket technology, so spacecraft have to get some help, in the form of slingshot maneuvers off other planets, called gravity assists. “Any available launch vehicle—even near-future, the most powerful—it won’t be able to shoot a spacecraft to get to the sun.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-a-human-touches-the-sun>What happens if a human touches the sun?</h2>
<p>Well first thing’s first: You would disintegrate. At the temperature of the Sun, most of the molecules that make up our bodies could not even survive, that is why we would not only fry and die, we would really disintegrate (all the molecules breaking apart, leaving only loose atoms).</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-man-to-walk-on-sun>Who was the first man to walk on sun?</h2>
<p>North Korean becomes ‘first man to land on Sun’ in hoax news According to a report on Weird Asia News, the North Korean Central News reported that Hung Il Gong, 17, has become the first man to land on the sun. They even called it the “greatest human achievement of our time”.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-think-humans-will-ever-walk-on-the-sun>Do you think humans will ever walk on the Sun?</h2>
<p>No, and for a few different reasons. First, with current technology, no vessel – humans onboard or not – could get close enough to the physical surface of Sol, the star at the centre of our system (what is commonly called the Sun).</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-sun-goes-out-for-a-week>What happens when the sun goes out for a week?</h2>
<p>-A week after the Sun went out, the temperature all over the world would drop below zero. Most plants would have already perished due to the cold, and heat-loving animals would start to disappear shortly after. People would build shelters and try to survive the cold and lack of food.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-for-humans-to-walk-on-water>Is it possible for humans to walk on water?</h2>
<p>So although we can’t walk on water on our own, we can cheat. These devices work in two ways they either increase buoyancy, or they use a force called dynamic lift, according to John Bush, an applied mathematician at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
