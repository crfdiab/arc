<h2 id=which-colony-had-shipbuilding>Which colony had shipbuilding?</h2>
<p>Shipbuilding is one of the oldest industries in the United States with roots in the earliest colonial settlements. Shipbuilding quickly became a successful and profitable industry in Massachusetts, with its miles of coastline featuring protected harbors and bays, and extensive supplies of raw materials.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-southern-colonies-shipbuilding>Did the southern colonies shipbuilding?</h2>
<p>The southern colonies produced agricultural products like tobacco, cotton, rice, and indigo. Shipbuilding in the middle colonies lagged slightly behind, but it was well established in New York City and Philadelphia by 1720.</p>
<h2 id=which-section-of-the-english-colonies-had-a-strong-shipbuilding-industry>Which section of the English colonies had a strong shipbuilding industry?</h2>
<p>The New England colonies, however, were full of forests, giving the colonists the important natural resource of trees. These trees provided wood that colonists were able to use to build homes, buildings, and ships. Lumber became very important to the shipbuilding industry because they built ships for the colonies.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-13-colonies-was-shipbuilding-a-major-industry>Which of the 13 colonies was shipbuilding a major industry?</h2>
<p>Economy: Farming was difficult in the Massachusetts Bay Colony so people found other means of making a living by establishing a manufacturing base and trade. Major industry for the colony included Agriculture (fishing, corn, livestock), Manufacturing (lumbering, shipbuilding).</p>
<h2 id=why-was-shipbuilding-important-to-the-new-england-colonies>Why was shipbuilding important to the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>The shipbuilding industry was extremely important, especially to the New England Colonies in Colonial Times. The first ships were built for fishing, but trade was also conducted by water, which eventually led to the real demand in shipbuilding.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-new-england-colony-better-than-the-other>Why was the New England colony better than the other?</h2>
<p>While all colonial regions, New England, middle, and southern, had valuable attributes, there were things for which New England was better suited. The New England colonies had a climate that was cooler than the middle colonies and the southern colonies. The soil in New England was also rocky and not as fertile as the soil in the southern colonies.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-college-in-the-new-england-colonies>What was the first college in the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>The first college in the American colonies, Harvard, was founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1636. People in the New England colonies also had a longer life span at first than settlers in the Chesapeake, which was largely covered in a malarial swamp.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-geography-of-the-new-england-colonies>What was the geography of the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>The geography of the New England colonies was shaped by glaciers during the last ice age. The glaciers dug up and scraped away the rich soil in New England, leaving behind a thin layer of rocky soil that was too poor to sustain many crops. The many hills, mountains and thick forests in New England also made it difficult to farm the land.</p>
