<p>The Governor-General’s ceremonial duties include: attending the opening of a new Parliament and making a speech about what the new government intends to do. administering the oath of office to the Prime Minister, ministers, judges and other officials. meeting foreign heads of state and ambassadors.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-become-the-governor-general-of-canada>How do you become the governor general of Canada?</h2>
<p>The governor general is directly appointed by the prime minister of Canada, and until fairly recently it was common for the appointment to be openly partisan. Governor generals were usually retired politicians from the PM’s party, with the office used as a patronage present for years of faithful service.</p>
<h2 id=who-does-the-governor-general-report-to>Who does the Governor-General report to?</h2>
<p>While the Constitution Act (1867) places executive power in The Queen, in practice this power is exercised by the prime minister and his or her ministers. The governor general acts on the advice of the head of government but has the right to advise, encourage and warn.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-duties-of-the-governor-general-of-canada>What are the duties of the Governor General of Canada?</h2>

<h2 id=how-can-you-become-the-governor-general-of-canada>How can you become the Governor General of Canada?</h2>
<p>The queen (or other title of the reigning monarch) chose you. That’s it. Also, to be clear, the Queen chooses a person based on advice from the prime minister these days.
