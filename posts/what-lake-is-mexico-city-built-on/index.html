<p>Lake Texcoco<br>
Mexico City was founded by the people now called Aztecs – but who called themselves Tenochcas – in 1325. The Aztecs built their city on a rock in Lake Texcoco, mostly because the more prime locations along the shore were already taken.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-mexico-city-lake-dry-up>When did Mexico City lake dry up?</h2>
<p>It is believed that the lake disappeared and re-formed at least 10 times in the last 30,000 years. Agriculture around the lake began about 7,000 years ago, with humans following the patterns of periodic inundations of the lake. Several villages appeared on the northeast side of the lake between 1700 and 1250 BC.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-lake-around-tenochtitlan>What happened to the lake around Tenochtitlan?</h2>
<p>The Spanish conquered Tenochtitlán in 1521 and built their new colonial capital, Mexico City, on its ruins. Over the following centuries, engineers built drainage works to control the floods and eventually drain the lake almost completely.</p>
<h2 id=does-mexico-city-sit-on-a-lake>Does Mexico City sit on a lake?</h2>
<p>The Aztec city was on an island in Lake Texcoco, but the Spanish drained the surrounding lake over centuries and expanded Mexico City onto the new land. Today, much of the city stands on layers of sand and clay — up to 100 yards deep — that used to be under the lake.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-lake-in-mexico>What was the name of the lake in Mexico?</h2>
<p>The city of Tenochtitlan was built on an island within the lake. To control floods, the lake was drained and that lake basin is today known as Mexico City. Q. Is Lake Chapala in Mexico polluted?</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-lake-texcoco-in-mexico>How big was the Lake Texcoco in Mexico?</h2>
<p>And now, in place of the basin of the once-existing lake, the densely populated capital of Mexico is located. Surface elevation is 7.349 feet Long ago, before the melting of glaciers, Lake Texcoco was enormous in size and covered almost the entire Mexican valley.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-water-does-mexico-city-use>What kind of water does Mexico City use?</h2>
<p>Mexico City is built on the basin of ancient Lake Texcoco, the largest of several lakes of which only remnants remain, most of them drained to control flooding. Much of the ancient endorheic lake basin was fed from groundwater aquifers.</p>
