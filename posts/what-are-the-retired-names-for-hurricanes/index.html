<h2 id=which-hurricane-names-were-retired-after-the-2020-hurricane-season>Which hurricane name’s were retired after the 2020 hurricane season?</h2>
<p>WMO retired three 2020 hurricane names: Laura, Eta, and Iota, along with Dorian from 2019, for which the announcement was not made last year because of the pandemic.</p>
<h2 id=do-all-hurricane-names-get-retired>Do all hurricane names get retired?</h2>
<p>Atlantic tropical cyclone name lists repeat every six years unless a storm is so severe that the World Meteorological Organization’s Hurricane Committee votes to retire that name from future lists.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-hurricane-names-retired>Why are hurricane names retired?</h2>
<p>Names retired in the 1960s In 1960, four rotating lists of names were developed to avoid having to create new lists each year, while the practice of retiring any particularly damaging storm names for 10 years continued, with 11 names deemed significant enough to be retired during the decade.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-atlantic-hurricane-names-get-retired>How often do Atlantic hurricane names get retired?</h2>
<p>Atlantic hurricane and tropical storm name lists repeat every six years, unless one is so destructive and/or deadly that the committee votes to retire that name from future lists. This avoids the use of, say, Katrina, Sandy or Maria to describe a future weak, open-ocean tropical storm.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-retired-names-for-tropical-cyclones>Are there any retired names for tropical cyclones?</h2>
<p>Below is a list of retired names for the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. There are, however, a great number of destructive storms not included on this list because they occurred before the hurricane naming convention was established in 1950. Can I have a tropical cyclone named for me?</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-last-name-of-a-hurricane>What was the last name of a hurricane?</h2>
<p>Retired Hurricane Names, Alphabetically. Agnes (1972) Alicia (1983) Allen (1980) Allison (tropical storm, 2001) Andrew (1992)</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-november-hurricane>What was the name of the November hurricane?</h2>
<p>Before landfall, Iota became only the second Atlantic Basin Category 5 November hurricane on record. Massive rainfall flooding once again swamped Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. Tropical cyclones that are so destructive and/or deadly can be retired from future name lists.</p>
