<p>The twelve classifications are sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silt, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, and clay. Soil textures are classified by the fractions of each soil separate (sand, silt, and clay) present in a soil.</p>

<p>Soils of India: Six Different Types of Soils Found in India</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alluvial Soils: These are formed by the deposition of sediments by rivers.</p>
</li>

<p>Although, superiority of clay textured soil in rice paddies were observed, there were no mutual findings on the ideal soil composition for rice growing soils [19, 20, 21]. It shows that the dominant soil texture of the province planted with rice is loam with 30 soil samples out of 98 soil samples.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-soil-for-rice>What is the best soil for rice?</h2>
<p>Which Soil Is Good For Growing Rice?</p>
<ul>
<li>Clayey loam or riverine alluvial soils are the best for growing rice because they hold on to water and do not allow it to drain away.</li>
<li>Rice can be grown in a wide range of soil conditions, from regular top soil to soil heavy-laden with clay.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-soil-does-the-philippines-have>What kind of soil does the Philippines have?</h2>
<p>Originating from alluvium parent materials, the soils are brownish, clayey, and of mas- sive structure. The natural fertility is rated high. Its major land use is irrigated paddy rice.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-poorest-type-of-soil-for-agriculture>Which is the poorest type of soil for agriculture?</h2>
<p>State the characteristics of sandy soil. Sandy soil essentially consists of small particles formed by weathering rocks. It is also very low nutrients and poor in holding water, which makes it one of the poorest types of soil for agriculture. 3. Explain the significant features of a silty soil. Silt has much smaller particles compared to sand.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-for-drainage-clay-or-sandy-soil>Which is better for drainage clay or sandy soil?</h2>
<p>This type of soil is very good for the drainage system. Sandy soil is usually formed by the breakdown or fragmentation of rocks like granite, limestone, and quartz. Silt, which is known to have much smaller particles compared to the sandy soil and is made up of rock and other mineral particles which are smaller than sand and larger than clay.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-up-the-sand-in-sandy-soil>What makes up the sand in sandy soil?</h2>
<p>Sandy soil contains more than 35% sand and less than 15% clay and slit. Primarily this soil formed due to erosion and fragmentation of rocks like granite, limestone, and quartz. Its particles are comparatively large ranging from 0.2 to 2 mm in size making it extremely porous.</p>
