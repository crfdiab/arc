<p>You can’t walk up the steps, but you can get up to them. I took several pictures from different vantage points. It’s cool to see the Capitol building from different directions and in different light.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-visit-the-us-capitol-without-a-tour>Can you visit the U.S. Capitol without a tour?</h2>
<p>Do I have to take a tour of the historic Capitol to enter the Capitol Visitor Center? No, the Visitor Center is a public access building and you do not need a tour ticket to enter.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-watch-a-session-of-congress>Can you watch a session of Congress?</h2>
<p>The Senate and House Galleries are open to visitors whenever either legislative body is in session; however the Galleries are not included as part of the U.S. Capitol tour. Passes are required to enter the Galleries. Visitors may obtain Gallery passes from the offices of their senators or representative.</p>
