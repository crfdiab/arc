<h2 id=where-did-mendel-do-his-work>Where did Mendel do his work?</h2>
<p>He was at home in the monastery’s botanical garden where he spent many hours a day breeding fuchsias and pea plants. Keeping the peas. Mendel did not set out to conduct the first well-controlled and brilliantly-designed experiments in genetics. His goal was to create hybrid pea plants and observe the outcome.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-gregor-mendel-most-famous-for>What is Gregor Mendel most famous for?</h2>
<p>Gregor Mendel discovered the basic principles of heredity through experiments with pea plants, long before the discovery of DNA and genes. Mendel was an Augustinian monk at St Thomas’s Abbey near Brünn (now Brno, in the Czech Republic).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-gregor-mendels-work-get-recognized>When did Gregor Mendel’s work get recognized?</h2>
<p>He published his work in 1866, demonstrating the actions of invisible “factors”—now called genes—in predictably determining the traits of an organism. The profound significance of Mendel’s work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century (more than three decades later) with the rediscovery of his laws.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-gregor-mendels-work-impact-the-world>How did Gregor Mendel’s work impact the world?</h2>
<p>Gregor Mendel, through his work on pea plants, discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance. Mendel tracked the segregation of parental genes and their appearance in the offspring as dominant or recessive traits. He recognized the mathematical patterns of inheritance from one generation to the next.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-gregor-mendel-do-as-a-monk>What did Gregor Mendel do as a monk?</h2>
<p>He was a monk in Augustinian Abbey of St Thomas in Brno where he worked as a teacher. He had a deep interest in botany which led him to conduct experiments on pea plants. Inspired by the work of a biologist named Franz Unger, he began his experiments in the monastery’s sprawling gardens.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-gregor-mendel-born-and-when-did-he-die>When was Gregor Mendel born and when did he die?</h2>
<p>Gregor Mendel, in full Gregor Johann Mendel, original name (until 1843) Johann Mendel, (born July 22, 1822, Heinzendorf, Silesia, Austrian Empire [now Hynčice, Czech Republic]—died January 6, 1884, Brünn, Austria-Hungary [now Brno, Czech Republic]), botanist, teacher, and Augustinian prelate,…</p>
<h2 id=how-did-gregor-mendel-contribute-to-the-study-of-genetics>How did Gregor Mendel contribute to the study of genetics?</h2>
<p>A monk, Mendel discovered the basic principles of heredity through experiments in his monastery’s garden. His experiments showed that the inheritance of certain traits in pea plants follows particular patterns, subsequently becoming the foundation of modern genetics and leading to the study of heredity. Early Life</p>
<h2 id=when-did-gregor-mendel-become-a-catholic-priest>When did Gregor Mendel become a Catholic priest?</h2>
<p>In 1843, he began his training as a priest and joined the Augustinian Abbey of St Thomas in Brno as a monk. He took the name ‘Gregor’ on entering the religious field.</p>
