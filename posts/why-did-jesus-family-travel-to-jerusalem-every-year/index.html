<h2 id=why-did-jesus-family-travel-to-jerusalem-every-year>Why did Jesus family travel to Jerusalem every year?</h2>
<p>They had dedicated the baby Jesus according to the law of Moses, and they traveled to Jerusalem each year to celebrate Passover. God had commanded the men to appear before Him three times a year to observe certain festivals.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-holy-family-flee-to-egypt>Why did the Holy Family flee to Egypt?</h2>
<p>The Holy Family is said to have fled to Egypt, where King Herod could exert no political powers and consequently, would not be able to harm baby Jesus. Upon arriving in Egypt, the Holy Family moved locations very frequently so as to avoid the reach of Herod’s spies.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-mary-and-joseph-leave-nazareth>Why did Mary and Joseph leave Nazareth?</h2>
<p>Some liken Joseph and Mary to immigrants because of their difficult trek from Nazareth to Bethlehem, while others say they became immigrants only after the birth of Jesus, when they fled to Egypt because Herod, the king of Judea, sought to kill the newborn.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-jesus-go-to-jerusalem>Why did Jesus go to Jerusalem?</h2>
<p>My answer is that Jesus went up to Jerusalem to make twin demonstrations, first against Roman imperial control over the City of Peace and, second, against Roman imperial control over the Temple of God. In other words, put personally, against the (sub)governor Pilate and his high-priest Caiaphas.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-jesus-doing-in-his-fathers-house>What was Jesus doing in his father’s house?</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether Jesus said he was in his Father’s house or about his Father’s business, it is clear he was in the Temple court. And this is what He was doing there: Sitting among the teachers. Listening to the teachers.</p>
<h2 id=did-jesus-escape-egypt>Did Jesus escape Egypt?</h2>
<p>The flight into Egypt is a story recounted in the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 2:13–23) and in New Testament apocrypha. Soon after the visit by the Magi, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream telling him to flee to Egypt with Mary and the infant Jesus since King Herod would seek the child to kill him.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-jesus-parents-go-to-bethlehem>Why did Jesus parents go to Bethlehem?</h2>
<p>In Luke, Joseph and Mary’s trip to Bethlehem is undertaken in order to satisfy an imperial command that all individuals return to their ancestral towns “that all the world should be taxed.” Since Mary was pregnant with Jesus at the time the command had to be carried out, this explains why Jesus was born in the town of …</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-family-of-jesus-flee-to-egypt>How did the family of Jesus flee to Egypt?</h2>
<p>JESUS’ FAMILY FLEES TO EGYPT JOSEPH MOVES HIS FAMILY TO NAZARETH Joseph wakes Mary up to give her urgent news. Jehovah’s angel has just appeared to him in a dream, telling him: “Get up, take the young child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I give you word, for Herod is about to search for the young child to kill him.”</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-holy-family-flee-to-in-the-bible>Where did the Holy Family flee to in the Bible?</h2>
<p>The holy family flee to Egypt. Matt. 2:13-18 Joseph is warned by an angel in a dream to take Jesus and Mary to Egypt to escape King Herod’s wrath (see 3 on Map 4).</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-israelites-flee-to-in-the-bible>Where did the Israelites flee to in the Bible?</h2>
<p>Fearing reprisals, all the Israelites at Mizpah had fled to Egypt, taking with them the prophet Jeremiah (see Jeremiah 40:6, 41:1-2 &16-18 & 43:1-5). The Jews settled at Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis in the Nile Delta region of Lower Egypt (see Jeremiah 44:1 and Map 4).</p>
<h2 id=where-did-joseph-and-his-family-flee-to>Where did Joseph and his family flee to?</h2>
<p>— Jeremiah 31:15. In the meantime, Joseph and his family have fled to Egypt, and they continue living there. Then one night Jehovah’s angel again appears to Joseph in a dream.</p>
