<h2 id=how-has-the-invention-of-the-toothbrush-influenced-society>How has the invention of the toothbrush influenced society?</h2>
<p>The toothbrush makes a big impact on society/people in both negative and positive ways. – the current toothbrushes don’t harm your gums as much as the chew stick did. – the current toothbrushes clean your teeth more than the older forms of them. – Keeps your mouth CLEAN!</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-benefit-to-electric-toothbrushes>Is there a benefit to electric toothbrushes?</h2>
<p>Electric toothbrushes clean teeth and gums much better than a manual toothbrush, according to the findings of a new study. Scientists found that people who use an electric toothbrush have healthier gums, less tooth decay and also keep their teeth for longer, compared with those who use a manual toothbrush.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-impact-of-the-toothbrush>What is the impact of the toothbrush?</h2>
<p>Made up of mainly plastic-based materials, toothbrushes have become a culprit in the global pollution problem. Plastic harms the environment due to the synthetic materials that make up the material. These synthetic materials are what prevent plastic from decomposing naturally.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-people-use-electric-toothbrushes>What type of people use electric toothbrushes?</h2>
<p>Other people they can help include: Children: Kids may think that electric ones are more fun and easier to use. People with braces: These brushes can clean in and around the metal parts. Lazy brushers: If your dentist thinks you’re not removing enough plaque with a manual toothbrush, they may suggest an electronic one.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-toothbrush-impact-the-world>How did the toothbrush impact the world?</h2>
<p>Brushing teeth regularly became popular in the United States after soldiers returned home and brought with them their strict habits of brushing their teeth. This influence spurred the development of more advanced toothbrushes and helped bring oral hygiene into the mainstream.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-history-of-the-toothbrush>What is the history of the toothbrush?</h2>
<p>The toothbrush as we know it today was not invented until 1938. However, early forms of the toothbrush have been in existence since 3000 BC. Ancient civilizations used a “chew stick,” which was a thin twig with a frayed end. The bristle toothbrush, similar to the type used today, was not invented until 1498 in China.</p>
<h2 id=do-dentists-recommend-electric-toothbrushes>Do dentists recommend electric toothbrushes?</h2>
<p>Both electric and manual toothbrushes are effective at cleaning teeth if you use proper technique and brush long enough. Overall, an electric toothbrush may make brushing easier, resulting in better plaque removal. Talk with your dentist if you have questions about which toothbrush might be best for you.</p>
<h2 id=do-electric-toothbrushes-whiten-teeth>Do electric toothbrushes whiten teeth?</h2>
<p>Due to our food habits and lifestyles, stains develop on teeth. If one takes precautions, then these yellowish stains can disappear. From standard toothbrushes to electric toothbrushes are now available for everyone in the market. Electric toothbrushes can whiten teeth’s efficiently.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-should-you-replace-your-toothbrush>How often should you replace your toothbrush?</h2>
<p>every three to four months<br>
“The average person should be swapping out for a new toothbrush every three to four months,” explains Dr. Sienna Palmer, DDS, dentist at Meridien Dental in Santa Monica, CA. “This is recommended to ensure that the bristles are still effective and bacteria accumulation on the toothbrush is minimal.”</p>
<h2 id=which-toothbrush-do-dentists-recommend>Which toothbrush do dentists recommend?</h2>
<p>Dentists recommend brushing teeth for a minimum of two minutes, twice a day, with a soft-bristled toothbrush. The right toothbrush is a matter of personal preference and financial considerations. A classic, manual brush costs a few dollars. An electric toothbrush can cost over $100.</p>
<h2 id=is-sonic-toothbrush-better-than-electric>Is sonic toothbrush better than electric?</h2>
<p>While both the sonic and electric toothbrushes work well in comparison to the manual toothbrush, the sonic toothbrush is undeniably more efficient in cleaning your teeth. Electric toothbrushes typically have bristles that either scrub forward and backward or rotate in a mechanized motion.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-good-to-have-an-electric-toothbrush>Is it good to have an electric toothbrush?</h2>
<p>Electric toothbrushes can help keep your teeth clean and are perfect for people of all ages. They are powerful and offer a smooth brush. There are even rechargeable toothbrushes. Get brighter, whiter teeth with your very own electric toothbrush.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-electric-toothbrush-important-in-world-war-2>Why was the electric toothbrush important in World War 2?</h2>
<p>During World War II 1 million brushes were supplied to the armed forces The hygiene habits of soldiers meant that the public became more concerned with oral hygiene themselves and began very quickly adopting the nylon bristled toothbrush.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-electric-toothbrush-come-from>Where did the first electric toothbrush come from?</h2>
<p>50 years after Dr. Scott’s apparent electric toothbrush, Switzerland was the country in which the first real electric toothbrush came about. The mechanical toothbrush didn’t do all that well because it was said to be ineffective and sales of it were stopped.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-plastic-toothbrushes-in-the-world-a-year>How many plastic toothbrushes in the world a year?</h2>
<p>And if everyone around the world followed those recommendations, about 23 billion toothbrushes would get trashed annually. Most are traditional toothbrushes, but some 55 million U.S. brushers use electric toothbrushes each year, so some number of those plastic-handled, battery-containing objects also end up in the waste stream each year.</p>
