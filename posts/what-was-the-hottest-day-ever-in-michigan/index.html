<p>You have to go back to the summer of 1936 and the worst heatwave on record in the United States to find Michigan’s hottest ever weather recording. Two communities in Michigan hit 112 degrees on July 13, 1936, Stanwood in Mecosta County and Mio in Oscoda County.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-weather-in-grand-rapids-on-may-31>What was the weather in Grand Rapids on May 31?</h2>
<p>Mostly cloudy. * Reported May 31 9:53 pm — Jun 15 9:53 pm, Grand Rapids. Weather by CustomWeather, © 2021 Note: Actual official high and low records may vary slightly from our data, if they occured in-between our weather recording intervals…</p>

<p>More surprisingly, the location of those extremes might puzzle you. You probably think the Upper Peninsula should be the holder of Michigan’s coldest temperature. The interior area of Lower Michigan has actually recorded the coldest temperature. This week back in 1934 saw Michigan plunge to its coldest temperature ever at 51 degrees below zero.</p>
