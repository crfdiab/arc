<h2 id=what-are-the-main-reasons-that-the-rate-of-deposition-would-increase>What are the main reasons that the rate of deposition would increase?</h2>
<p>Factors leading to deposition include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>waves starting to slow down and lose energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shallow water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sheltered areas, eg bays.</p>
</li>

<h2 id=little-or-no-wind-what-causes-deposition-to-occur>little or no wind. What causes deposition to occur?</h2>
<p>Deposition occurs when a river loses energy. When rivers flood the velocity of water slows. As the result of this the river’s capacity to transport material is reduced and deposition occurs. This deposition leaves a layer of sediment across the whole floodplain.</p>
<h2 id=what-affects-deposition-rate>What affects deposition rate?</h2>
<p>But today, we’re going to talk about the 3 important factors affecting the deposition rate in magnetron sputtering: the sputtering voltage, current and power.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-result-of-deposition>What is the result of deposition?</h2>
<p>Deposition is the geological process in which sediments, soil and rocks are added to a landform or landmass. Wind, ice, water, and gravity transport previously weathered surface material, which, at the loss of enough kinetic energy in the fluid, is deposited, building up layers of sediment.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-deposition-rate>What is meant by deposition rate?</h2>
<p>Deposition rate refers to the amount of filler metal melted into the weld joint and is defined by pounds per hour (PPH). Single-wire SAW applications can achieve deposition rates of up to 40 PPH, depending on wire size, type, and polarity.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-deposition-rate-and-time>What is the relationship between deposition rate and time?</h2>
<p>The higher deposition rate corresponds to a thicker deposit at the same deposition time, which in turn results in a higher deposit resis- tance.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-erosion-and-deposition-by-flowing-water>What causes erosion and deposition by flowing water?</h2>
<p>Flowing water erodes or deposits particles depending on how fast the water is moving and how big the particles are. Faster-moving water has more energy. Therefore, it can carry larger particles. It can carry more particles. What causes water to move faster? The slope of the land over which the water flows is one factor.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-negative-effects-of-acid-deposition>What are the negative effects of acid deposition?</h2>
<p>Acid deposition can have negative effects on freshwater ecosystems because acidic runoff enters the water and alters the pH. Fish and other animals die when water becomes too acidic, and there are places all over the world where water bodies are now too acidic to support the natural plants and animals. One such place is the New Jersey Pine Barrens.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-deposition-in-water>Which is an example of deposition in water?</h2>
<p>Deposition also occurs when a stream or river empties into a large body of still water. In this case, a delta forms. A delta is shaped like a triangle. It spreads out into the body of water. An example is shown in Figure above.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-deponent-make-changes-to-a-deposition>Can a deponent make changes to a deposition?</h2>
<p>As stated in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 30 (e), a deponent is permitted to make changes to their deposition transcription or recording for 30 days following its release. Upon careful review of the transcript or recording, the deponent must sign a statement that clearly lists any changes and outlines the need for the changes to be made.</p>
