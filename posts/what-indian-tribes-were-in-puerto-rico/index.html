<h2 id=what-indian-tribes-were-in-puerto-rico>What Indian tribes were in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>The Taíno were an Arawak people who were the indigenous people of the Caribbean and Florida. At the time of European contact in the late 15th century, they were the principal inhabitants of most of Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola (the Dominican Republic and Haiti), and Puerto Rico.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-taíno-indians-call-puerto-rico>What did the Taíno Indians call Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>The Taíno name for Puerto Rico was Boriken. This is why Puerto Rico is now also called Borinquen by Puerto Rican people, and why many Puerto Ricans call themselves Boricua.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-taíno-tribe>Is there a Taíno tribe?</h2>
<p>Taino, Arawakan-speaking people who at the time of Christopher Columbus’s exploration inhabited what are now Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-indigenous-people-of-puerto-rico>Who are the indigenous people of Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>The Taína Route and Indigenous Culture in Puerto Rico Caves, trails, graves, and petroglyphs tell the story of the island’s cultural origins. The Taíno people populated most of the Caribbean and some adjacent territories during the pre-Columbian era, long before the arrival of Spaniards and others to Puerto Rico.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-taino-tribe-live-in-puerto-rico>Where did the Taino tribe live in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>The Classic Taíno lived in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, while the Eastern Taíno lived in the northern islands of the Lesser Antilles. At the time of Columbus’s arrival in 1492, there were five Taíno chiefdoms in Hispaniola, each led by a principal Cacique ( chief ), to whom tribute was paid.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-famous-people-in-puerto-rico>Who are the famous people in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>Castillo Serrallés: former home of the Serrallés family, owners of the Don Q distillery. In the late 1800s, the desire for independence from the Spanish crown boiled over in Puerto Rico.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-island-of-puerto-rico-get-its-name>How did the island of Puerto Rico get its name?</h2>
<p>Initially, Columbus christened the Island as San Juan Bautista (St. John the Baptist). Still, the name was soon changed to Puerto Rico, or “rich port,” when the Spaniards realized the impressive amount of gold found in its rivers.</p>
