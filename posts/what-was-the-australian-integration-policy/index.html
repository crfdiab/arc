<h2 id=what-was-the-australian-integration-policy>What was the Australian integration policy?</h2>
<p>During the period 1962–72 integration replaced assimilation as official government policy in dealing with migrants in Australia. Migrants were now encouraged to incorporate themselves into the dominant Anglo-Celtic society but also to retain elements of their own culture.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-integration-policy>What was the purpose of the integration policy?</h2>
<p>The term ‘integration’ was sometimes used by the critics of the assimilation policy to denote a policy that recognised the value of Aboriginal culture and the right of Aboriginals to retain their languages and customs and maintain their own distinctive communities, but there was a deliberate effort on the part of the …</p>
<h2 id=who-created-integration-policy>Who created integration policy?</h2>
<p>The federal Labor Government led by Gough Whitlam adopted the policy of ‘self-determination’ for Indigenous communities in 1972. This policy was described as ‘Aboriginal communities deciding the pace and nature of their future development as significant components within a diverse Australia’.</p>
<h2 id=is-integration-a-policy>Is integration a policy?</h2>
<p>Governments’ policies, initiatives, and programs help determine immigrants’ opportunities to participate in society, as well as their guarantees to the same rights and responsibilities as those of the native born. …</p>
<h2 id=how-do-immigrants-integrate-into-society>How do immigrants integrate into society?</h2>
<p>State laws designed to help immigrants integrate into society include helping them pass naturalization tests and learn English, removing barriers to licensing for certain occupations, and creating integration positions or task forces.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-benefits-of-assimilation>What are the benefits of assimilation?</h2>
<p>List of the Pros of Assimilation</p>
<ul>
<li>It improves security at every level of society.</li>
<li>It creates more employment opportunities for immigrants.</li>
<li>It offers protection to those who need it.</li>
<li>It improves the overall health of the immigrant.</li>
<li>It improves perinatal health.</li>
<li>It creates more tourism outreach opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-have-policy-integration>What does it mean to have policy integration?</h2>
<p>Policy integration concerns the management of cross-cutting issues in policy-making that transcend the boundaries of established policy fields, and which do not correspond to the institutional responsibilities of individual departments. It also refers to the management of policy responsibility within a single organisation or sector.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-integration-policy-australia-in-1972>What was the integration policy Australia in 1972?</h2>
<p>Beside this, what was the integration policy Australia? The federal Labor Government led by Gough Whitlam adopted the policy of ‘self-determination’ for Indigenous communities in 1972. This policy was described as ‘Aboriginal communities deciding the pace and nature of their future development as significant components within a diverse Australia’.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-idea-of-integration-come-from>Where did the idea of integration come from?</h2>
<p>Integration is a devolved matter and each of the constituent nations of the UK has developed its own approach – though responsibility for migration policy remains in the Home Office. The history of integration policy began in the 1960s, directed at migrants from New Commonwealth countries.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-national-policy-on-integration-in-the-uk>Is there a national policy on integration in the UK?</h2>
<p>There is no national policy framework on integration. There are integration policies relating to one category of migrant refugees, and to those applying for settlement and UK citizenship (see the policy primer on ‘ Citizenship: What Is It and Why Does It Matter? ’).</p>
