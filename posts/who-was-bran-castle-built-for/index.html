<h2 id=who-was-bran-castle-built-for>Who was Bran castle built for?</h2>
<p>In 1377 King Louis I of Hungary authorized the Transylvanian Saxons of the Brașov region to build a castle as a bulwark against northward expansion of the Ottoman Empire. The castle was completed by 1388; it also served as a customs house for Transylvania, then a voivodate (province) of Hungary.</p>
<h2 id=who-built-the-bran-castle-in-romania>Who built the Bran Castle in Romania?</h2>
<p>Built on the site of a Teutonic Knights stronghold dating from 1212, Bran castle was first documented in an act issued on November 19, 1377, giving the Saxons of Kronstadt (Brasov) the privilege to build the Citadel.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-1st-vampire>Who is the 1st vampire?</h2>
<p>The first vampire started out as not a vampire at all, but as a human man named Ambrogio. He was an Italian-born adventurer who fate brought to Delphi, in Greece. You can read the full story here, but in a nutshell a series of blessings and curses transformed this young man into history’s first vampire.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-bran-castle-first-mentioned-in-history>When was Bran Castle first mentioned in history?</h2>
<p>The first documented mentioning of Bran Castle is the act issued by Louis I of Hungary on 19 November 1377, giving the Saxons of Kronstadt (modern Brașov) the privilege to build the stone castle at their own expense and labour force; the settlement of Bran began to develop nearby.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-teutonic-knights-build-bran-castle>When did the Teutonic Knights build Bran Castle?</h2>
<p>However when the castle was originally built by the Teutonic Knights it was not at all like the images most people have come to associate with Bran Castle. It was a wooden fortress, and it was built in approximately 1219.</p>

<p>Popularly—if inaccurately—identified with the fictional Castle Dracula, Bran Castle is one of Romania’s top tourist attractions. The first known fortress near Bran Pass (now called Rucăr-Bran Pass), a trade route across the Carpathian Mountains, was erected after 1211 by knights of the Teutonic Order but was held only briefly.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-bran-castle-in-romania-located>Where is the Bran Castle in Romania located?</h2>
<p>Bran Castle, Romanian Castelul Bran, medieval stronghold in the Transylvanian Alps (Southern Carpathian Mountains) of Brașov county, central Romania. Popularly—if inaccurately—identified with the fictional Castle Dracula, Bran Castle is one of Romania’s top tourist attractions.</p>
