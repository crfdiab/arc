<h2 id=how-was-the-swiss-plateau-formed>How was the Swiss Plateau formed?</h2>
<p>The contemporary landscape of the Swiss Plateau has been shaped by the ice age glaciers. During all the known alpine glaciations (Günz glaciation, Mindel glaciation, Riss glaciation and Würm glaciation), huge glaciers penetrated the Swiss Plateau.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-switzerlands-landforms>What are Switzerland’s landforms?</h2>
<p>Switzerland lies at the heart of Europe. It has three distinct geographical regions: the Alps, the Central Plateau and the Jura. The country boasts an extraordinary variety of landscapes and habitats, which make it a highly attractive place to live in and do business.</p>

<p>Melting snow forms fast-streaming masses of water by which stones and rock-waste are carried away and rocks slowly are grinded into round shapes. This, for instance, can be seen at the Trümmelbachfälle. Glaciers slowly slide down the mountain slope and grind new valleys.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-landforms-formed-when-the-earth-shifts>How are landforms formed when the Earth shifts?</h2>
<p>When the earth shifts, landforms such as fold mountains, volcanoes and rift valleys can occur. Volcanoes are an example of a landform that can go on to produce other landforms, such as craters, calderas and lava domes. Landforms can also occur through the process of weathering, which is the process by which sediments…</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-mountains-in-switzerland-always-in-motion>Why are the mountains in Switzerland always in motion?</h2>
