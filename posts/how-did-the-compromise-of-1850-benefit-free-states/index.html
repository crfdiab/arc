<h2 id=how-did-the-compromise-of-1850-benefit-free-states>How did the Compromise of 1850 benefit free states?</h2>
<p>The Compromise of 1850 contained the following provisions: (1) California was admitted to the Union as a free state; (2) the remainder of the Mexican cession was divided into the two territories of New Mexico and Utah and organized without mention of slavery; (3) the claim of Texas to a portion of New Mexico was …</p>
<h2 id=did-the-compromise-of-1850-give-concessions-to-southerners>Did the Compromise of 1850 give concessions to southerners?</h2>
<p>A statute enacted as part of the compromise prohibited the slave trade in Washington, D.C., but not slave ownership. Southerners in Congress, alarmed and outraged, were unanimous in opposing the provision, seen as a concession to the abolitionists and a bad precedent, but they were outvoted.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-compromise-of-1850>What was the purpose of the Compromise of 1850?</h2>
<p>The Compromise of 1850 was a package of five separate bills passed by the United States Congress in September 1850 that defused a political confrontation between slave and free states on the status of territories acquired in the Mexican–American War.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-south-get-in-the-compromise>What did the south get in the compromise?</h2>
<p>In the Compromise, the South didn’t get Southern California, but only a theoretical possibility of slavery by “popular sovereignty” in Utah and New Mexico, both already settled by populations who did not want to give way to Southern plantation society or Texans.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-james-taylor-important-to-the-compromise-of-1850>Why was James Taylor important to the Compromise of 1850?</h2>
<p>As president, Taylor sought to defuse the sectional controversy as much as possible, and, above all else, to preserve the Union. Although Taylor was born in Virginia before relocating to Kentucky and owned more than one hundred slaves by the late 1840s, he did not push for slavery’s expansion into the Mexican Cession.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-missouri-compromise>What was the result of the Missouri Compromise?</h2>
<p>Texas claimed land north of the 36°30′ demarcation line for slavery, set by the 1820 Missouri Compromise. The Texas Annexation resolution had required that if any new states were formed out of Texas’ lands, those north of the Missouri Compromise line would become free states.</p>
