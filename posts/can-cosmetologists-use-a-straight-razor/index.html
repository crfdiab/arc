<h2 id=can-cosmetologists-use-a-straight-razor>Can cosmetologists use a straight razor?</h2>
<p>Although laws vary, in most states, cosmetologists cannot use a razor to shave customers and are restricted to only trimming a beard or mustache with scissors. Cosmetologists are normally the only ones who can use wax to remove hair. In most states, barbers cannot offer manicures, but cosmetologists usually can.</p>
<h2 id=why-cant-barbers-use-straight-razors>Why can’t barbers use straight razors?</h2>
<p>Because a strop is porous and cannot be sanitized, NEVER strop the razor without then completing the entire sanitation process. The same is true if the razor comes in contact with any other unsanitary surface. NEVER use the razor on multiple clients.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-better-to-be-a-barber-or-cosmetologist>Is it better to be a barber or cosmetologist?</h2>
<p>Many aspiring hairdressers wonder whether they should become barbers or cosmetologists. The truth is, becoming a barber is better: It grants you mastery over more skills and empowers you to earn a greater income! A cosmetologist cannot perform certain services, such as shaving.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-will-a-straight-razor-shave-last>How long will a straight razor shave last?</h2>
<p>Most straight razor shaves last 2 days. On top of that, you are running a blade across skinless, thus decreasing chances for cuts, missed patches, and irritation.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-barbers-stop-using-straight-razors>When did Barbers stop using straight razors?</h2>
<p>Now mostly found at retro barbers, the straight razor was the most commonly used option by men until the 1950s when it was largely replaced by the safety razor. Straight razors allow the wielder to whip out the blade with a dramatic flourish (not recommended).</p>
<h2 id=how-dangerous-are-straight-razors>How dangerous are straight razors?</h2>
<p>The truth is that using a straight razor or shavette type razor is just as dangerous as shaving with a disposable razor. Although it is possible to cut yourself, it will most likely be no worse than a paper cut if you take short and gentle passes. There is rarely heavy bleeding or complications.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-cosmetologist-use-a-straight-razor-for-neck-shaving>Can a cosmetologist use a straight razor for neck shaving?</h2>
<p>Cosmetologists are permitted to use a straight razor to engage in neck shaving services under the Barber, Cosmetology, Esthetics, Hair Braiding, and Nail Technology Act, 225 ILCS 410/.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-be-a-cosmetologist-without-a-license>Is it illegal to be a cosmetologist without a license?</h2>
<p>By law, any services done within the field of cosmetology for any form of compensation is illegal if done without a completed education and a license. If it is a specialized field and they have the license for that field alone, they may do so, but are not qualified for anything else. What Are The Consequences?</p>
<h2 id=can-a-cosmetologist-do-a-reflexology-massage-without-a-license>Can a cosmetologist do a reflexology massage without a license?</h2>
<p>A cosmetologist is not permitted to perform massages in the torso area, nor is she allowed to perform therapeutic massages, including reflexology massages, without having the appropriate license. The exact credential that is required for cosmetologists seeking to provide massage therapy services varies by state.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-transfer-your-cosmetology-license>Do you have to transfer your cosmetology license?</h2>
<p>Licenses are not universal and, as such, require that if the license-holder wishes to continue their practice after leaving the state they have qualified to operate in, they must transfer their license.</p>
