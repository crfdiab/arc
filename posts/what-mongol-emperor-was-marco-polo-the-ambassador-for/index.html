<p>Kublai<br>
Kublai (also spelled Kubla or Khubilai) relegated his Chinese subjects to the lowest class of society and even appointed foreigners, such as Venetian explorer Marco Polo, to important positions over Chinese officials.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-marco-polos-relationship-with-the-mongols>What was Marco Polo’s relationship with the Mongols?</h2>
<p>Marco Polo’s father and uncle traveled in 1260 throughout the Mongol empire, all the way to its capital in China. There they requested trade and missionary contacts.

<p>According to The Travels of Marco Polo, they passed through much of Asia, and met with Kublai Khan, a Mongol ruler and founder of the Yuan dynasty. Their decision to leave Constantinople proved timely. In 1261 Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, took Constantinople,…</p>

<h2 id=who-was-the-great-kublai-khan-in-marco-polo>Who was the great Kublai Khan in Marco Polo?</h2>
<p>After three years crossing seas, deserts and the Silk Road, a young Marco Polo finds himself a prisoner of the great Kublai Khan. Kublai learns of betrayal by his brother Ariq of Karakorum during the siege of the farming city of WuChang, as Kublai Khan battles his warmonger brother for rule over Mongolia.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-miles-did-marco-polo-travel-in-one-day>How many miles did Marco Polo travel in one day?</h2>
<p>Marco affirmed that those courier horsemen could travel 250 or 300 miles in a day. Marco Polo traveled in great deal in China.
