<h2 id=what-country-is-in-stage-5-of-the-demographic-transition>What country is in stage 5 of the Demographic Transition?</h2>
<p>Possible examples of Stage 5 countries are Croatia, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Japan, Portugal and Ukraine. According to the DTM each of these countries should have negative population growth but this has not necessarily been the case.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-is-in-stage-4-of-the-demographic-transition-model>What country is in stage 4 of the Demographic Transition Model?</h2>
<p>That being said, Stage 4 of the DTM is viewed as an ideal placement for a country because total population growth is gradual. Examples of countries in Stage 4 of the Demographic Transition are Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, Brazil, most of Europe, Singapore, South Korea, and the U.S.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-is-in-stage-2-of-the-demographic-transition>What country is in Stage 2 of the Demographic Transition?</h2>
<p>Still, there are a number of countries that remain in Stage 2 of the Demographic Transition for a variety of social and economic reasons, including much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Guatemala, Nauru, Palestine, Yemen and Afghanistan.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-japan-a-stage-5-country>Why Is Japan a stage 5 country?</h2>
<p>Japan is in the fifth stage of the demographic transition model meaning that their birth rate is decreasing, their death rate is low and their rate of natural increase is negative.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-in-stage-5-of-the-demographic-transition>What happens in Stage 5 of the demographic transition?</h2>
<p>Stage Five. In stage 5 of the demographic transition, a country encounters misfortune as a whole this is because the death rate becomes higher than the birth rate. There will be a negative population growth rate which will affect the country. This will take a generation or two before the population grows back up.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-russia-learn-from-the-demographic-transition>What can Russia learn from the demographic transition?</h2>
<p>In the coming decades, as Russia experiences a major demographic transition, adjustments to policies and to individual behavior can significantly reduce the impact on labor force participation, the incidence of disease, and economic growth.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-demographic-transition-in-the-20th-century>What was the demographic transition in the 20th century?</h2>
<p>By the late 20th century, birth rates and death rates in developed countries leveled off at lower rates. Some scholars break out, from stage four, a “stage five” of below-replacement fertility levels. Others hypothesize a different “stage five” involving an increase in fertility.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-population-of-russia-changing-over-time>How is the population of Russia changing over time?</h2>
<p>Like several other countries around the world, Russia faces advanced population aging, along with declining fertility and mortality in the decades ahead. The long-term social and economic impacts of these changes will be significant, affecting labor markets, health and pension systems, and economic growth.</p>
