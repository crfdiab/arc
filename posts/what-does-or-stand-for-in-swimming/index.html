<h2 id=what-are-the-terminologies-in-swimming>What are the terminologies in swimming?</h2>
<p>Swimming terminology jargon buster</p>
<ul>
<li>Freestyle – most people know that there are four strokes in swimming, and most of us know them as front crawl, backstroke, butterfly and breaststroke.</li>
<li>Dolphin kick – the dolphin kick is usually used for the butterfly stroke, and the start and turns in a race, as it is very fast.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-does-ar-stand-for-in-swimming>What does AR stand for in swimming?</h2>
<p>Augmented Swimming: FORM’s Dan Eisenhardt Brings AR Goggles to Life.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-tags-stand-for-in-swimming>What does tags stand for in swimming?</h2>
<p>TAGS stands for Texas Age Group Swimming Championships. It is the premiere 14 and under state championship meet in the country. It is one of our team goals each season to compete for this team title.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-swimming-fast-called>What is swimming fast called?</h2>
<p>Sprint – All out as fast as you can go, breathing as little as you can. Steady – Swimming at a pace which is easily maintained (not easy or too hard, aiming for consistency of pace) Streamline – Underwater body position after diving or pushing off the wall which maximises swim speed and efficiency.</p>
<h2 id=how-swimming-works-inside-and-outside-your-body>How swimming works inside and outside your body?</h2>
<p>“Swimming not only engages your legs, but also recruits your upper body and core, especially your lats — the muscles of your middle back — and triceps,” she explains. Certain movements like dolphin kicks, flutter kicks, and more can help strengthen your core. And your lungs also really benefit from this sport.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-im-order-for-swimming>What is the IM order for swimming?</h2>
<p>In individual medley events, the swimmer covers the four swimming styles in the following order: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle. In medley relay events, swimmers will cover the four swimming styles in the following order: backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-swimming-race-called>What is a swimming race called?</h2>
<p>Doing It All. One race, called the individual medley, involves swimming all four strokes in a particular order — butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle. Individual medley, or IM, races can be from 100 yards to 400 meters.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-good-swim-time>What is a good swim time?</h2>
<p>Swim times vary according to age and ability. In general, average lap swimmers in a 100 m pool comfortably complete a 100 m swim in two minutes. A swimmer who has an easy interval time of two minutes would consider a 100 m time of one minute 30 seconds very good.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-tags-stand-for>What does tags stand for?</h2>
<p>TAGS</p>
<table><tr><th>Acronym</th><th>Definition</th></tr><tr><td>TAGS</td><td>Text and Graphics System</td></tr><tr><td>TAGS</td><td>Theater Air Ground System (US DoD)</td></tr><tr><td>TAGS</td><td>The Atlantic Groundfish Strategy</td></tr><tr><td>TAGS</td><td>Transparent Armor Gun Shields</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=where-does-the-dfl-begin-in-the-foot>Where does the DFL begin in the foot?</h2>
<p>The DFL begins deep in the sole of the foot with the distal attachments of the three muscles of the deep posterior compartment of the leg: the tibialis posterior and the two long flexors of the toes, the flexor hallucis and digitorum longus (Fig. 9.4).</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-dfl-related-to-the-hip-joint>How is the DFL related to the hip joint?</h2>
<p>Though fundamentally fascial in nature, in the leg the DFL includes many of the deeper and more obscure supporting muscles of our anatomy (Fig. 9.3). Through the pelvis, the DFL lies in intimate relation with the hip joint, and relates the wave of breathing to the rhythm of walking.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-myofascia-of-the-dfl-do>What does the myofascia of the DFL do?</h2>
<p>The myofascia of the DFL is infused generally with denser fascia and more slow-twitch, endurance muscle fibers, reflecting the role the DFL plays in providing stability and subtle positioning changes to the core structure to enable the more superficial structures and lines to work easily and efficiently with the skeleton.</p>
