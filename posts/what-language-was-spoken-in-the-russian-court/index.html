<h2 id=what-language-was-spoken-in-the-russian-court>What language was spoken in the Russian court?</h2>
<p>The languages used by the Tsar and Tsarina in their private life are English and German, though they speak also French and Italian. The Tsarina did not learn Russian until after her betrothal, and though she has a good accent she speaks it very slowly.</p>
<h2 id=who-ruled-russia-during-the-enlightenment>Who ruled Russia during the Enlightenment?</h2>
<p>Russia at the time was ruled by Peter the Great’s daughter, the empress Elizabeth, whose 20-year reign greatly stabilized the monarchy. Devoted to much pleasure and luxury and greatly desirous of giving her court the brilliancy of a European court, Elizabeth prepared the way for Catherine.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-russian-royalty-called>What is Russian royalty called?</h2>
<p>The Russian word for nobility, dvoryanstvo (дворянство), derives from Slavonic dvor (двор), meaning the court of a prince or duke (kniaz), and later, of the tsar or emperor. A nobleman is called a dvoryanin (plural: dvoryane).</p>
<h2 id=did-russia-have-an-enlightenment>Did Russia have an enlightenment?</h2>
<p>The Russian Age of Enlightenment was a period in the 18th century in which the government began to actively encourage the proliferation of arts and sciences, which had a profound impact on Russian culture.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-of-russian-is-french>How much of Russian is French?</h2>
<table><tr><th>Languages of Russia</th></tr><tr><td>Official</td><td>Russian official throughout nation; thirty-five others coofficial in various regions</td></tr><tr><td>Main</td><td>Russian</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign</td><td>13–15% have foreign language knowledge English (80% out of all foreign language speakers or 11% of the population) German (16%) French (4%) Turkish (2%)</td></tr><tr><td>Signed</td><td>Russian Sign Language</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-russian-name>What is the most Russian name?</h2>
<p>Ljubov (Любовь), Love in English is the most Russian name amongst the average Russians.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-king-louis-xiv-have-his-council-meetings>Where did King Louis XIV have his council meetings?</h2>
<p>At 11:00 AM, council meetings were held at the king’s apartments, followed by a private meal in the bedchamber at 1:00 PM. At 2:00 PM, Louis announced his intentions for the afternoon, perhaps a promenade, a picnic with the ladies, or a hunt.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-nobles-live-in-louis-xivs-court>Where did the nobles live in Louis XIV’s court?</h2>
<p>Many had their own living quarters in the Versailles outbuildings and were obliged to adhere to the maddeningly intricate etiquette that governed daily life at the royal residence. Ranked immediately below the royal bastards, the hierarchy of nobles from duke to baron was strictly delineated at court.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-title-of-russian-nobleman-become-formal>When did the title of Russian nobleman become formal?</h2>
<p>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the title of the nobleman in Russia gradually became a formal status, rather than a reference to a member of the aristocracy, due to a massive influx of commoners via the Table of ranks.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-most-literate-ruler-of-russia>Who was the most literate ruler of Russia?</h2>
<p>The most literate ruler in Russian history, Catherine constantly patronized cultural life; in particular a flurry of satirical journals and comedies were published anonymously with her significant participation. Extensive traveling demonstrated in Catherine a great thirst for exploring the empire.</p>
