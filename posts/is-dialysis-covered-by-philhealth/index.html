<h2 id=is-dialysis-covered-by-philhealth>Is dialysis covered by PhilHealth?</h2>
<p>Disease Stage 5 (CKD 5) or end- stage renal disease is a fatal condition affecting many Filipinos, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) announced that it is extending its coverage for hemodialysis patients from 90 to 144 sessions for the year 2021.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-dialysis-sessions-are-covered-by-philhealth>How many dialysis sessions are covered by PhilHealth?</h2>
<p>PhilHealth expands dialysis coverage to 144 sessions.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-cost-of-dialysis-process>What is the cost of dialysis process?</h2>
<p>The monthly cost of HD in most private hospitals average Rs 12000 and the yearly cost of dialysis is Rs 1, 40000, equivalent of $3000, which is in sharp contrast to an annual cost of $60,000 in the US and UK.</p>
<h2 id=can-kidneys-start-working-again-after-dialysis>Can kidneys start working again after dialysis?</h2>
<p>The kidneys usually start working again within several weeks to months after the underlying cause has been treated. Dialysis is needed until then.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-you-live-after-dialysis>How long do you live after dialysis?</h2>
<p>Average life expectancy on dialysis is 5-10 years, however, many patients have lived well on dialysis for 20 or even 30 years. Talk to your healthcare team about how to take care of yourself and stay healthy on dialysis.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-can-a-person-live-off-dialysis>How long can a person live off dialysis?</h2>
<p>People who stop dialysis may live anywhere from one week to several weeks, depending on the amount of kidney function they have left and their overall medical condition.</p>
<h2 id=what-level-of-creatinine-requires-dialysis>What level of creatinine requires dialysis?</h2>
<p>There is not a creatinine level that dictates the need for dialysis. The decision to start dialysis is a decision made between a nephrologist and a patient. It is based on the level of kidney function and the symptoms that the patient is experiencing.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-dialysis-take-at-home>How long does dialysis take at home?</h2>
<p>Conventional home hemodialysis: You do this three times a week for three to four hours or longer each time. You and your care partner are trained to do dialysis safely and to handle any problems that may come up. Training may take from several weeks to a few months.</p>
<h2 id=at-what-age-is-dialysis-not-recommended>At what age is dialysis not recommended?</h2>
<p>The findings suggest that conservative care may be a reasonable option for some kidney failure patients over 80. The researchers don’t say that dialysis treatment should not be given to anybody older than 80 or with severe co-occurring conditions.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-stop-dialysis-once-you-start>Can you stop dialysis once you start?</h2>
<p>In most cases, once a patient starts dialysis, he or she will not survive without it. However, in a few cases, patients have improved and the disease has gone into remission, allowing them to stop dialysis. Here is some information on this phenomenon, courtesy of Dr. Allen Laurer of Associates in Nephrology.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-for-dialysis-in-manila>How much does it cost for dialysis in Manila?</h2>
<p>The price of hemodialysis in Manila Doctors Hospital can range from Php 4,000 to Php 6,000 as estimates. Hemodialysis centers in Quezon City comprise of clinics and hospitals. It is easier to undergo treatment if you can choose a center near you.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-dialysis-in-cambodia>How much does it cost to get dialysis in Cambodia?</h2>
<p>In Cambodia, vascular access creation costs 1- to 1.4-million KHR (approximately $250-350 USD, or over 20% of the average household income in Cambodia), and if done for emergency hemodialysis, costs an additional $4 million KHR (approximately $100 USD) on top of treatment. Similar costs are seen in most other low-income countries.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-kidney-dialysis-treatment-cost>How much does kidney dialysis treatment cost?</h2>
<p>Injectable medications and vitamins can add hundreds of dollars to the cost, depending on what is prescribed. For example, DaVita [2] , which has many dialysis centers across the United States, charges about $480 for a dialysis treatment, not including medications.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-sessions-of-dialysis-per-day-in-philhealth>How many sessions of dialysis per day in PhilHealth?</h2>
<p>For each day, there is a fixed number of sessions. Some may have 3 sessions per day while bigger hospitals may have up to 5 sessions. Philhealth has recently increased its coverage of hemodialysis treatment. As of the latest details, it will now cover up to 90 days (or 90 sessions) worth of dialysis per patient.</p>
