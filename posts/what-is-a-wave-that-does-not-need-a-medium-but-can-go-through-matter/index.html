<h2 id=what-is-a-wave-that-does-not-need-a-medium-but-can-go-through-matter>What is a wave that does not need a medium but can go through matter?</h2>
<p>Electromagnetic waves<br>
Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-waves-called-that-require-a-medium-to-travel-through>What are the waves called that require a medium to travel through?</h2>
<p>Mechanical waves require a medium in order to transport their energy from one location to another. A sound wave is an example of a mechanical wave.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-transverse-waves>What are transverse waves?</h2>
<p>Transverse wave, motion in which all points on a wave oscillate along paths at right angles to the direction of the wave’s advance. Surface ripples on water, seismic S (secondary) waves, and electromagnetic (e.g., radio and light) waves are examples of transverse waves.</p>

<p>A sound wave is an example of a mechanical wave. What types of waves do not need a medium to travel? Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-matter-does-a-mechanical-wave-travel-through>What kind of matter does a mechanical wave travel through?</h2>
<p>The matter through which a mechanical wave travels is called the medium (plural, media). There are three types of mechanical waves: transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves. They differ in how particles of the medium move when the energy of the wave passes through.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-electromagnetic-waves-different-from-regular-waves>How are electromagnetic waves different from regular waves?</h2>
<p>Electromagnetic waves, on the other hand, are waves that move through a vacuum as they don’t require a medium or matter. In a vacuum, electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light, commonly denoted c.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-electromagnetic-waves-able-to-travel-through-space>How are electromagnetic waves able to travel through space?</h2>
<p>These changing fields form electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space.</p>
