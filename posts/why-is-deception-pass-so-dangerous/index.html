<p>Deep currents in the pass make diving extremely treacherous, and they carry the dead away. Nothing that water can move stays in the pass, and this water can move almost anything.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-deception-pass-known-for>What is Deception Pass known for?</h2>
<p>Known for breathtaking views, old growth forests and abundant wildlife, its topography features rugged cliffs that drop to meet the swirling waters of Deception Pass. The park has historical interest and many varieties of landscapes.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-swim-in-deception-pass>Can you swim in Deception Pass?</h2>
<p>Deception Pass State Park is primarily known for its beaches, but Cranberry Lake is an important addition to the park.

<h2 id=how-deep-is-the-water-under-deception-pass>How deep is the water under Deception Pass?</h2>

<h2 id=are-there-bears-at-deception-pass>Are there bears at Deception Pass?</h2>
<p>KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED FOR WILDLIFE “Just about anything you’d expect in the Northwest, except maybe a bear – although there have been bears sighted as well, but not for a long time,” he said.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-walk-across-deception-pass>Can you walk across Deception Pass?</h2>
<p>You can walk across the bridge. There are sidewalks on either side. The best places to park to walk the bridge are a parking lot at the south end of the bridge, a small lot in the middle at canoe pass bridge (northbound traffic only) and some pull-out spots just north of the bridge (southbound traffic only).</p>
<h2 id=what-does-crossing-the-bridge-mean>What does crossing the bridge mean?</h2>
<p>to delay worrying about something that might not happen anyway. to deal with a problem only when it arises. don’t try to solve something before it becomes a problem. resolve a problem when it occur, rather than try to solve it in advance.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-adak-island-in-the-aleutian-islands>Where is Adak Island in the Aleutian Islands?</h2>
<p>Adak Island (Aleut: Adaax, Russian: Адак) is an island near the western extent of the Andreanof Islands group of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-highest-point-on-adak-island>How tall is the highest point on Adak Island?</h2>
<p>Due to harsh winds, frequent cloud cover, and cold temperatures, vegetation is mostly tundra (grasses, mosses, berries, low-lying flowering plants) at lower elevations. The highest point is Mount Moffett, near the northwest end of the island, at an elevation of 3,924 feet (1,196 m).</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-temperature-in-adak-alaska>What’s the average temperature in Adak, Alaska?</h2>
<p>Adak’s average temperatures range from 20 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit, with a record high of 75 °F (August 1956) and a record low of 3 °F (January 1963 and February 1964). Average annual precipitation is about 54.8 inches.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-live-in-the-town-of-adak>How many people live in the town of Adak?</h2>
<p>After the town of Unalaska (also known as Dutch Harbor and made famous by the TV show, Deadliest Catch), you’d be lucky to count 1,000 people living further west. Adak rounds out that count, settling in at 437 miles east of Attu Island – the very end of the U.S.</p>
