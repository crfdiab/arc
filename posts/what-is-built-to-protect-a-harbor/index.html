<h2 id=what-is-built-to-protect-a-harbor>What is built to protect a harbor?</h2>
<p>A breakwater is a man-made structure built out into the sea with the purpose of creating a safe harbor, marina, or anchorage for fishing vessels and protecting the coast from powerful swells and waves. They can be a useful tool to prevent beach erosion, but breakwaters also have unintended negative consequences.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-beach-protection-structure>What are the beach protection structure?</h2>
<p>Hard structural/engineering options use structures constructed on the beach (seawalls, groynes, breakwaters/artificial headlands) or further offshore (offshore breakwaters). These options influence coastal processes to stop or reduce the rate of coastal erosion.</p>
<h2 id=what-protects-the-shoreline>What protects the shoreline?</h2>
<p>Coral reefs provide a buffer, protecting our coasts from waves, storms, and floods. Corals form barriers to protect the shoreline from waves and storms. The coral reef structure buffers shorelines against waves, storms, and floods, helping to prevent loss of life, property damage, and erosion.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-sea-barrier-called>What is a sea barrier called?</h2>
<p>A seawall (or sea wall) is a form of coastal defence constructed where the sea, and associated coastal processes, impact directly upon the landforms of the coast.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-protect-the-sea-shore>How can we protect the sea shore?</h2>
<p>4.0 COASTAL PROTECTION WORKS IN INDIA Commonly adopted method of coastal protection in India is construction of Rubblemound Seawall. Groins and detached seawalls are also used at few sites. Artificial beach nourishment is successfully carried out through sand bypassing systems at Visakhapatnam and Paradip Ports.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-jetties>What are the pros and cons of jetties?</h2>
<p>The jetty prevents the natural flow of water and the sand and sediment that are carried with the flow cannot get past the structure. This accumulation reverses erosion and provides extra sand for the beaches behind the jetty. This accumulation creates unintended consequences for other beaches.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-natural-harbors-used-to-protect-ships>How are natural harbors used to protect ships?</h2>
<p>Natural harbors, typically in bays, estuaries , and river mouths, occur where land and water converges in such a way as to protect ships from wind and waves as they enter and dock. Harbors can also be constructed using jetties and breakwaters to provide protection for ships.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-breakwaters-important-to-the-construction-of-harbours>Why are breakwaters important to the construction of harbours?</h2>
<p>19. Breakwaters • Breakwater are the structures constructed to enclose the harbours to protect them from the effect of wind generated waves by reflecting and dissipating their force or energy. • Helps to use the area thus enclosed as a safe anchorage for ships and to facilitate loading and unloading of water by means of wave breakers.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-hard-stabilization-structures-important-to-the-ocean>Why are hard stabilization structures important to the ocean?</h2>
<p>Hard Stabilization structures built to protect a coast from erosion or to prevent the movement of sand along a beach Groin built perpendicular to a coastline and are specifically designed to trap sand moving along the ocast in longshore transport -large blocks of rocky material (rip-rap)</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-harbour-and-sea-works>What is the meaning of harbour and Sea Works?</h2>
<p>Harbours and sea works, harbour also spelled harbor, any part of a body of water and the manmade structures surrounding it that sufficiently shelters a vessel from wind, waves, and currents, enabling safe anchorage or the discharge and loading of cargo and passengers.</p>
