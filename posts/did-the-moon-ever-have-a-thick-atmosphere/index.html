<h2 id=did-the-moon-ever-have-a-thick-atmosphere>Did the moon ever have a thick atmosphere?</h2>
<p>In October 2017, NASA scientists at the Marshall Space Flight Center and the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston announced their finding, based on studies of Moon magma samples retrieved by the Apollo missions, that the Moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of 70 million years between …</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-moon-have-a-thin-atmosphere>Why does the moon have a thin atmosphere?</h2>
<p>The thin atmosphere, so the scientists reason, was created by gases derived from lava outpourings that engulfed huge areas of the Moon about 3.5 billion years ago, at a time when life already existed on Earth. So much gas was produced that the lunar atmosphere was 1.5 times thicker than the current atmosphere on Mars.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-moon-unable-to-form-a-thick-atmosphere-like-the-earth>Why was the moon unable to form a thick atmosphere like the Earth?</h2>
<p>Our Moon doesn’t have an atmosphere because it is too small and doesn’t have a strong magnetic field. Any atmosphere it might have had would be stripped away by the solar wind that barrages the small world. In contrast, our planet has more mass to hold its atmosphere close, and a strong magnetic field to protect it.</p>
<h2 id=why-moon-has-no-atmosphere-while-jupiter-has-thick-atmosphere>Why Moon has no atmosphere while Jupiter has thick atmosphere?</h2>
<p>Since r.m.s velocity of all the gases is more than the escape velocity from its surface, all the gases escape the surfce of moon. That is why moon does not have any atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-no-atmosphere-on-the-moon>Why is there no atmosphere on the Moon?</h2>
<p>Moon has no atmosphere because the value of acceleration due to gravity ‘g’ on the surface of moon is small. Therefore, the value of escape velocity on the Moon has no atmosphere because the value of acceleration due to gravity ‘g’ on the surface of moon is small. Therefore, the value of escape velocity on the</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-moon-have-a-thick-atmosphere>When did the Moon have a thick atmosphere?</h2>
<p>They say that two heavy periods of volcanic activity in particular, 3.8 and 3.5 billion years ago, are thought to have fed a relatively thick atmosphere compared to the infinitesimal molecules that make up the moon’s hardly detectable atmosphere today. The findings were recently published in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-moon-wetter-than-the-earth>Why is the Moon wetter than the Earth?</h2>
<p>The moon may not only be wetter than we once thought, but also more dynamic. One of the critical differences between the atmospheres of Earth and the moon is how atmospheric molecules move. Here in the dense atmosphere at the surface of Earth, the molecules’ motion is dominated by collisions between the molecules.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-moon-really-surrounded-by-a-vacuum>Is the moon really surrounded by a vacuum?</h2>
<p>Moon is actually surrounded By a Vacuum:- Talking about the moon, it has no atmosphere and instead of the atmosphere, there is a total vacuum surrounding it.</p>
