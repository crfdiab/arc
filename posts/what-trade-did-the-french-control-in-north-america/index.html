<p>fur trade<br>
They fought for control of North America and the rich fur trade. The French, who had a strong presence in the Great Lakes region early on, built a fort at Green Bay in 1717 to tighten their hold on the western Great Lakes.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-france-focus-on-in-north-america>What did France focus on in North America?</h2>
<p>Motivations for colonization: The French colonized North America to create trading posts for the fur trade. Some French missionaries eventually made their way to North America in order to convert Native Americans to Catholicism.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-french-position-threaten-the-american-colonists>How did the French position threaten the American colonists?</h2>
<p>The French threatened not only the British Empire but the American colonists themselves, for in holding the Mississippi Valley, France could limit their westward expansion. The delegates also declared a union of the American colonies “absolutely necessary for their preservation,” and adopted the Albany Plan of Union.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-fur-trade-important-to-france>Why was the fur trade important to France?</h2>
<p>Tar and potash were produced and the French colonies’ future seemed assured and proficient. The lengthy history of the fur trade in North America is closely linked with exploration of the continent, and the struggle between France and Britain to control it.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-french-do-in-north-america>What did the French do in North America?</h2>
<p>During their forays onto North American shores, the French encountered the Natives and developed a good relationship with them.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-fur-trade-in-north-america>Where was the fur trade in North America?</h2>
<p>The lengthy history of the fur trade in North America is closely linked with exploration of the continent, and the struggle between France and Britain to control it. At first the trade was centred along the banks of the St. Laurence River and the Atlantic coasts around Newfoundland and Acadia in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-tribe-to-trade-with-the-french>Who was the first tribe to trade with the French?</h2>
<p>The Huron and Ottawa tribes were the first tribes with whom the French traded, but the trade eventually moved to other tribes who wanted in on the action. The things they were trading fur for with the French were equal to great wealth in their societies.</p>
