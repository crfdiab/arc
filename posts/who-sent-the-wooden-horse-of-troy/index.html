<p>According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, Odysseus thought of building a great wooden horse (the horse being the emblem of Troy), hiding an elite force inside, and fooling the Trojans into wheeling the horse into the city as a trophy. Under the leadership of Epeius, the Greeks built the wooden horse in three days.</p>

<p>Epeius<br>
The horse was built by Epeius, a master carpenter and pugilist. The Greeks, pretending to desert the war, sailed to the nearby island of Tenedos, leaving behind Sinon, who persuaded the Trojans that the horse was an offering to Athena (goddess of war) that would make Troy impregnable.</p>

<p>The Wooden Horse is a 1950 British Second World War war film directed by Jack Lee and starring Leo Genn, David Tomlinson and Anthony Steel. The film depicts the true events of an escape attempt made by POWs in the German prison camp Stalag Luft III.</p>
<h2 id=who-left-the-wooden-horse-on-the-beach>Who left the wooden horse on the beach?</h2>
<p>The Greeks leave the wooden horse outside the gates of Troy and pretend to leave. The Trojans wheel the horse inside the city believing they have won the war…but they’re making a big mistake.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-moral-of-the-wooden-horse>What is the moral of the wooden horse?</h2>
<p>The Greeks, under the guidance of Odysseus, built a huge wooden horse — the horse was the symbol of the city of Troy — and left it at the gates of Troy. They then pretended to sail away. The Trojans believed the huge wooden horse was a peace offering to their gods and thus a symbol of their victory after a long siege.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-inventor-of-the-wooden-horse>Who was the inventor of the wooden horse?</h2>
<p>The Wooden Horse plan itself was actually conceived and entirely thought through by Williams and Michael Codner in equal measures. In Oliver Philpot ‘s later book The Stolen Journey, the author made it clear that he initially thought the plan was “crackers”, telling its inventors “I give it a couple of days!”</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-wooden-horse-in-the-trojan-horse>What was the wooden horse in the Trojan Horse?</h2>
<p>The wooden horse in the title of the film is a piece of exercise equipment the prisoners use to conceal their escape attempt as well as a reference to the Trojan Horse which was also used to conceal men within.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-odysseus-come-up-with-the-wooden-horse>How did Odysseus come up with the wooden horse?</h2>
<p>It was all a cunning trick thought up by the wiliest of the Greeks, the red haired Odysseus (ode-iss-see-us), who was never short of a plan. The Trojans saw that the Greeks had left behind a strange offering. It was a giant wooden horse with ribs made from the planks of fir trees.</p>
