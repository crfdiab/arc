<h2 id=how-did-geography-impact-the-citizens-of-ancient-greece-and-their-daily-lives>How did geography impact the citizens of ancient Greece and their daily lives?</h2>
<p>The geography of the region helped to shape the government and culture of the Ancient Greeks. Geographical formations including mountains, seas, and islands formed natural barriers between the Greek city-states and forced the Greeks to settle along the coast.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-geography-influence-settlement>How did geography influence settlement?</h2>
<p>European settlement patterns were influenced by geographic conditions such as access to water, harbors, natural protection, arable land, natural resources and adequate growing season and rainfall. Examine a variety of primary sources to determine why colonists were drawn to a particular region of the country.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-geography-influence-settlement-and-way-of-life-in-ancient-greece-quizlet>How did geography influence settlement and way of life in ancient Greece quizlet?</h2>
<p>How did the seas influence settlement and way of life in ancient Greece? It allowed Greeks to travel to other lands for new colonies and good trade. Mountains forced Greeks to settle in isolated communities.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-positive-and-negative-effects-geography-had-on-ancient-greek-civilization>What are some positive and negative effects geography had on ancient Greek civilization?</h2>
<p>Geography had an enormous impact on the ancient Greek civilization. The people of ancient Greece took advantage of all this saltwater and coastline and became outstanding fishermen and sailors. There was some farmland for crops, but the Greeks could always count on seafood and waterfowl to eat.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-geography-impact-the-development-of-the-13-colonies>How did geography impact the development of the 13 colonies?</h2>
<p>Geography caused some colonies to become centers of trade, and others to output huge amounts of crops. The Mid-Atlantic colonies used their large rivers, fertile soil and open plains for large scale farming. …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-an-important-export-of-ancient-greece>What was an important export of ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>Athens’ port city, Piraeus, flourished and brought the city wealth as trade grew. Grapes and olives grow well in Greece, and wine and olive oil became some of their most important exports. The fame and quality of Greek artists also ensured that their finished products were in high demand.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-geography-affect-the-settlement-of-ancient-greece>How did geography affect the settlement of ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>Settlement in ancient Greece was influenced by geography, just as it was for people of other ancient cultures. High mountains separated Greek communities from one another, making it easier for the Greek people to interact with outsiders than with each other.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-ancient-greeks-live-in-greece>Where did the ancient Greeks live in Greece?</h2>
<p>Greece also includes many islands throughout the Mediterranean and the Aegean (ih-JEE-uhn) seas. Mainland Greece is a land of steep, rugged mountains, almost entirely surrounded by turquoise blue seas. The ancient Greeks lived on farms or in small villages scattered throughout the country.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-ancient-greeks-find-fertile-land>Where did the ancient Greeks find fertile land?</h2>
<p>They also established colonies throughout the Mediterranean, wherever they could find a piece of available fertile land. Fertile land was as good as gold. Meanwhile, back in Greece, the Greek city-states were isolated from each other by the mountains, forests, and the sea.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-ancient-greeks-get-their-resources>How did the ancient Greeks get their resources?</h2>
<p>The Ancient Greeks came to dominate sea trade in the region. They traded wood, olive oil – olive trees happen to love rocky soil – and other products in order to get the resources they needed. They also established colonies throughout the Mediterranean, wherever they could find a piece of available fertile land.</p>
