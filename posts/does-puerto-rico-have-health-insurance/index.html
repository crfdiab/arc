<h2 id=does-puerto-rico-have-health-insurance>Does Puerto Rico have health insurance?</h2>
<p>Public Healthcare in Puerto Rico The public healthcare sector in Puerto Rico is generally well managed and is handled via a government-run program. No, healthcare is not free. However, the government provides insurance for those who qualify for the “la Reforma”, a government-funded program.</p>
<h2 id=is-healthcare-cheaper-in-puerto-rico>Is healthcare cheaper in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>In the latest report, Puerto Rico ranked 298 of 298 in health care costs, making it the most inexpensive area in this category. Compared to the U.S. index average of 100.0, the island had an index of 68.7.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-healthcare-does-puerto-rico-have>What kind of healthcare does Puerto Rico have?</h2>
<p>The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is the chief provider of health services for the indigent population, principally through the Medicaid program. The program operates within a publicly-owned and centrally administered health care delivery system which has operated under a Federal financial “cap” since 1968.</p>
<h2 id=does-humana-work-in-puerto-rico>Does Humana work in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has determined that Humana Health Plans of Puerto Rico, Inc. prescription drug coverage is, on average, expected to pay out as much as the standard Medicare prescription drug coverage will pay for all plan participants and is considered Creditable Coverage.</p>

<h2 id=how-much-does-medical-insurance-cost-in-puerto-rico>How much does medical insurance cost in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>Compared to U.S. insurance prices, Puerto Rico health insurance can sometimes cost half as much and covers much more. An individual PPO plan for a family of 5 is about $700 per month including medical, RX, dental and vision. A single medical plan including medical, RX, dental and vision is less than $200 per month.</p>
<h2 id=how-expensive-is-puerto-rico-healthcare>How expensive is Puerto Rico healthcare?</h2>

<p>Humana has served Medicare beneficiaries for more than 30 years, with nearly 8.4 million Medicare members in all 50 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, as of June 30, 2020 . Nearly 4.5 million of those members are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.</p>

<h2 id=do-doctors-in-puerto-rico-speak-english>Do doctors in Puerto Rico speak English?</h2>
<p>They don’t speak English, and they don’t know anyone on the mainland. “I would love to go, because I want what is best for my son,” Garcia said. “But I’m afraid.” The Garcias, like many other Puerto Ricans, are dealing with the effects of an acute and worsening doctor shortage that restricts access to healthcare.</p>
