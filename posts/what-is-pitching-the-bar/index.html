<h2 id=what-is-pitching-the-bar>What is pitching the bar?</h2>
<p>Pitching the Bar. It involved throwing a bar or log as far as possible. He put a stop to this, too.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-tudors-do-for-sports>What did Tudors do for sports?</h2>
<p>Full of glitz, glamour and celebrities, jousting was the most prestigious sport in Tudor England. It was even quite common for a young King Henry VIII to take part in the larger competitions, with thousands of local folk turning out to cheer him on from the crowd.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-a-tudor-football-made-of>What was a Tudor football made of?</h2>
<p>Football was seen as a sport for the poor and, as a result, the nobility didn’t take part. Games of football could go on for hours (and days, in some cases). The ball was made of a pig’s bladder stuffed with hair.</p>
<h2 id=what-colonists-do-for-fun>What colonists do for fun?</h2>
<p>Colonial life was filled with work, but it wasn’t always hard or boring. Early Americans knew how to turn work into fun by singing or telling stories, having contests, or working together in spinning or quilting bees. Some liked to dance to fiddle and fife music. Noah Webster loved to dance and play the fife.</p>
<h2 id=did-colonists-play-soccer>Did colonists play soccer?</h2>
<p>Team sports arrived in America relatively late in the colonial era. There are a few seventeenth-century descriptions of colonists playing football, but it appears to have been primarily a Native American game.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-tudors-celebrate-christmas>Did the Tudors celebrate Christmas?</h2>
<p>Christmas was a long festival celebrated by the Tudors. Advent was a time of fasting; Christmas Eve was particularly strictly kept with no meat, cheese, or eggs. Celebrations began on Christmas Day when 3 masses were said and the genealogy of Christ was sung while everyone held lighted tapers.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-bear-baiting-banned-in-the-tudors>Why was bear baiting banned in the Tudors?</h2>
<p>Popular with the lower and upper classes alike, bear baiting was considered a cruel sport even for the Tudors and the House of Commons voted to ban it in 1585 (although Queen Elizabeth subsequently overruled them). The ‘sport’ involved a bear being chained to a wooden post in the centre of a ring.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-popular-sport-in-tudor-england>What was the most popular sport in Tudor England?</h2>
<p>Another popular sport in Tudor England was bowls, with some of the middle and upper classes developing lawns for the sole purpose of playing the sport. Also played on these lawns was a game called ‘Pall-mall’, an early form of croquet.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-game-of-football-banned-in-the-tudors>Why was the game of football banned in the Tudors?</h2>
<p>By 1540 this concern had become so great that the government passed a law banning the game of football all together! Popular with the lower and upper classes alike, bear baiting was considered a cruel sport even for the Tudors and the House of Commons voted to ban it in 1585 (although Queen Elizabeth subsequently overruled them).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-object-of-the-tudor-games>What was the object of the Tudor Games?</h2>
<p>Instead of a 100 metre pitch, games of football would be played through the open countryside between rural villages. The object of the game was to capture the ball and bring it back to your own village, although as you can imagine, the referee may have had some problems keeping up with the ball!</p>
