<h2 id=what-was-family-life-like-in-massachusetts-colony>What was family life like in Massachusetts colony?</h2>
<p>A typical colonial family included parents, seven children and extended relatives. People were not permitted to live alone so grandparents, uncles, aunts, or cousins often lived with the nuclear family. Any servants the family may have had living with them were also considered a part of the family.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-massachusetts-called-in-1620>What was Massachusetts called in 1620?</h2>
<p>Plymouth<br>
One of the six New England states, and one of the first 13 states in the Union (it entered in 1788), Massachusetts is known as the “Bay State” or as the “Old Colony State.” The Pilgrims established their settlement at Plymouth in 1620, arriving on the Mayflower.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-a-puritan-society-punish-those-who-break-the-law>How did a Puritan society punish those who break the law?</h2>
<p>The Puritans never incarcerated prisoners for a long time. They accepted capital punishment, though, for 12 crimes, including blasphemy, counterfeiting and witchcraft. Puritan law recognized the principle that no one should be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-the-pilgrims-in-the-1620s>What was life like for the Pilgrims in the 1620s?</h2>
<p>A Pilgrim interpreter and a modern day Wampanoag Native American describe traditional food, games, and what life was like in the 1620s. Hundreds of students across the country submitted questions about The First Thanksgiving. For answers, we turned to Plimoth Plantation in Massachusetts.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-families-come-to-massachusetts>When did the first families come to Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>Most of the first families of Massachusetts came over wither on the Mayflower in 1620 or with the Winthrop Fleet in 1630. See Category: First families of Massachusetts</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-the-puritans-in-massachusetts>What was life like for the Puritans in Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>As people reproduced rapidly and children thrived, families were the backbone of Massachusetts communities. Children were generally well-educated, as Puritans believed that people must be able to read the Bible themselves.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-the-massachusetts-bay-colony>What was life like in the Massachusetts Bay Colony?</h2>
<p>Few of the houses which had been erected were comfortable, and the most of them were miserable coverings. Unused to such severities of climate, the poor people suffered severely from the cold. Many were frozen to death. The inconveniences of their accommodations increased the diseases which continued to prevail among them.</p>
