<h2 id=does-new-zealand-have-earthquake-resistant-buildings>Does New Zealand have earthquake resistant buildings?</h2>
<p>Designing earthquake-resistant structures Many buildings and bridges in New Zealand and overseas are protected with lead dampers and lead and rubber bearings invented by a New Zealander, Bill Robinson. These devices in building foundations can reduce the motion caused by ground shaking.</p>
<h2 id=are-concrete-buildings-earthquake-proof>Are concrete buildings earthquake proof?</h2>
<p>Built according to good practices, concrete homes can be among the safest and most durable types of structures during an earthquake. Homes built with reinforced concrete walls have a record of surviving earthquakes intact, structurally sound and largely unblemished.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-earthquake-in-christchurch-new-zealand-happen>When did the earthquake in Christchurch New Zealand happen?</h2>
<p>The epicenter of the quake was approximately 3 miles from the city center of Christchurch. The earthquake occurred more than five months after the September 4, 2010 earthquake of a 7.1 magnitude (in which no one died), and is considered to be an aftershock.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-in-case-of-earthquake-in-new-zealand>What to do in case of earthquake in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Citizens can also make efforts to be prepared in the case of earthquakes. National Crisis Management Centre; Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA); Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery; Christchurch City Council; residents (current & former) of Christchurch and Canterbury Plains; ANZ seismologists.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-gns-help-in-the-christchurch-earthquake>How did GNS help in the Christchurch earthquake?</h2>
<p>This helps scientists build models of plate movement, seismic activity and mountain building. A GNS scientist explains P and S waves, especially in relation to the Christchurch earthquakes. A GNS scientist explains rockfalls and his research after the Christchurch earthquake. Would you like to take a short survey?</p>
<h2 id=what-did-mill-do-after-the-christchurch-earthquake>What did mill do after the Christchurch earthquake?</h2>
<p>Mill also produced the Everyscape panoramic photos for the council.] After an earlier earthquake hit Christchurch in September last year, Mill, along with Google product manager Bruce Polderman held a workshop to teach residents how to use 3D modelling program Google SketchUp to create and enhance their virtual city.</p>
