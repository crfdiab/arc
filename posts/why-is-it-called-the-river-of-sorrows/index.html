<h2 id=why-is-it-called-the-river-of-sorrows>Why is it called the river of sorrows?</h2>
<p>the huang he river is called the river of sorrow because of it’s frequent devastating flooding.it kills every thing in it’s path human,Animal and buildings.</p>
<h2 id=why-huang-he-is-called-as-sorrow-of-china>Why Huang He is called as Sorrow of China?</h2>
<p>The sediment settles on its river bed. As if that was not enough, the Yellow River caused another cataclysmic flood that killed another million of Chinese people. It is these murderous floods that became characteristic of the Huang He that led to its being nicknamed “China’s Sorrow.”</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-still-live-near-the-river>Why do people still live near the river?</h2>
<p>The land along the rivers is fertile. If there is fertile land, then crops can be grown. Animals can also be raised if there is enough food and water for them. People learned that they could stay in one place and grow enough food to feed their community, if they were near a water supply.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-nicknames-for-the-huang-he-river>What are nicknames for the Huang He river?</h2>
<p>Yellow River, Chinese (Pinyin) Huang He or (Wade-Giles romanization) Huang Ho, also spelled Hwang Ho, English Yellow River, principal river of northern China, east-central and eastern Asia. The Yellow River is often called the cradle of Chinese civilization.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-humans-start-settling-near-rivers-and-lakes>Why did humans start settling near rivers and lakes?</h2>
<p>Early settlements grew near the river valleys due to the availibility of fresh water for drinking and irrigation purposes. Soil near the river valleys was also fertile which helped in agricultural activities.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-china-use-the-yellow-river-for>What did China use the Yellow River for?</h2>
<p>The Yellow River is the most important water resource for the dry north of China, playing an irreplaceable role in economic development, and agriculture. Since 1960 over 14 dams have been constructed on the river for hydroelectric power, which is vital to northern China’s infrastructure.</p>

<p>Yellow River<br>
Yellow River, Chinese (Pinyin) Huang He or (Wade-Giles romanization) Huang Ho, also spelled Hwang Ho, English Yellow River, principal river of northern China, east-central and eastern Asia. The Yellow River is often called the cradle of Chinese civilization.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-huang-he-river-called-chinas-sorrow>Why is the Huang He river called China’s sorrow?</h2>
<p>The nickname “China’s Sorrow” memorializes the millions that have been killed during the Huang He River’s many diversions and floods.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-huang-he-river-a-yellow-color>Why is the Huang He River a yellow color?</h2>
<p>The Huang He River’s distinctive yellow color is provided by its enormous sediment load, which causes the river’s bottom to rise every year. Although the government attempts to control its course through the use of levees, the structures have to be raised every year to keep pace with the sediment fill until the river eventually runs above land.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-huang-he-river-flood-in-1938>Why did the Huang He River flood in 1938?</h2>
<p>In June 1938, the Huang He River is thought to have flowed into one of the smaller and quieter rivers, flooding past the riverbanks and killing thousands in its path. At the time, the at-risk population was around 15 million people. After the flooding subsided, the rest of the deaths were attributed to waterborne diseases.</p>
