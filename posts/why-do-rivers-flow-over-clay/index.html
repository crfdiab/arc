<h2 id=why-do-rivers-flow-over-clay>Why do rivers flow over clay?</h2>
<p>Sediment in rivers gets deposited as the river slows down. Larger, heavier particles like pebbles and sand are deposited first, whilst the lighter silt and clay only settle if the water is almost still. When a river reaches a lake or the sea, it quickly deposits much of its sediment. …</p>
<h2 id=how-do-rivers-move-sediment>How do rivers move sediment?</h2>
<p>Erosion can move sediment through water, ice, or wind. Water can wash sediment, such as gravel or pebbles, down from a creek, into a river, and eventually to that river’s delta. Deltas, river banks, and the bottom of waterfalls are common areas where sediment accumulates.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-ways-that-sediment-moves-in-a-river>What are 3 ways that sediment moves in a river?</h2>
<p>Sediment transport is usually divided into three types: bed load, saltation, and suspension.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-dissolved-particles-of-sediment-carried-in-a-river>How are dissolved particles of sediment carried in a river?</h2>
<p>Streams carry dissolved ions and sediments. Particles that are too large to be suspended move along the stream bed by saltation. Rivers deposit sediments on levees, floodplains, and in deltas and alluvial fans.</p>
<h2 id=can-clay-be-found-in-river-banks>Can clay be found in river banks?</h2>
<p>Both river banks and flow ridges are made of clay. The reason for this is that no sand is deposited due to the low rate of flow, which makes the sand stay on the bottom of the river.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-rivers-transport-matter>How do rivers transport matter?</h2>
<p>2.6 Transport of Elements. Rivers transport material both in dissolved form and as solid load suspended matter and bottom sands). In the Solimoes, even the most mobile elements, such as sodium, are transported dominantly in a solid form.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-fine-particles-transported-in-a-river>How are fine particles transported in a river?</h2>
<p>Fine particles like clay and silt are transported in suspension, they are suspended in the water. Most of a river’s load is transported by suspension. Solutionis a special method of transportation. This is where particles are dissolved into the water so only rocks that are soluble, such as limestone or chalk, can be transported in solution.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-materials-transported-along-a-river-by-erosion>How are materials transported along a river by erosion?</h2>
<p>Material that has been loosened by erosion may be then transported along the river. There are four main processes of transportation. These are: traction. Suspension is when material made up of very fine particles such as clay and silt is lifted as the result of turbulence and transported by the river.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-rocks-as-they-move-down-a-river>What happens to rocks as they move down a river?</h2>
<p>Eroded rocks collide and break into smaller fragments. The edges of these rocks become smoother and more rounded. Attrition makes the particles of rock smaller. It does not erode the bed and bank. Pieces of river sediment become smaller and more rounded as they move downstream. Carbon dioxide dissolves in the river to form a weak acid.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-water-molecules-strongly-attracted-to-clay>Why are water molecules strongly attracted to clay?</h2>
<p>Water molecules are strongly attracted to clay mineral surfaces. When a little clay is added to water, a slurry forms because the clay distributes itself evenly throughout the water. This property of clay is used by the paint industry to disperse pigment (color) evenly throughout a paint.</p>
