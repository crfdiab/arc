<h2 id=what-did-people-buy-and-sell-in-the-han-dynasty>What did people buy and sell in the Han Dynasty?</h2>
<p>Merchants traded silk and paper (which were invented during this dynasty) because it was a popular product among the foreign traders. Merchants that originated from the west, traded horses, furs, ivory, and jade. This west silk route enabled them to acquire new items like cucumber, sesame, and alfalfa.</p>
<h2 id=what-goods-did-the-han-dynasty-trade>What goods did the Han dynasty trade?</h2>
<p>In return, foreign traders received furs, spices, jade, iron, ceramic, and bronze objects, as well as the much sought after silk. By the 1st century C.E., silk clothing became the style and obsession of Roman citizens.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-they-sell-or-trade-in-ancient-china>What did they sell or trade in ancient China?</h2>
<p>Besides silk, the Chinese also exported (sold) teas, salt, sugar, porcelain, and spices. Most of what was traded was expensive luxury goods. They imported, or bought, goods like cotton, ivory, wool, gold, and silver.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-han-dynasty-use-money>Did the Han Dynasty use money?</h2>
<p>During the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C. – A.D. 9), the question of monetary freedom was vigorously debated. There were as yet no banks or paper money in China — money consisted solely of coin. Private mints competed with government mints, either in the shadow market or legally.</p>

<p>yuanbao<br>
A yuanbao is a small metal ingot that was used in ancient China as money. Being made out of silver or gold, the value was determined by weight in taels, which is a weight measurement, part of the Chinese system of weights and currency (see also: baht). Yuanbaos were made by individual silversmiths for local exchange.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-han-dynasty-contribute-to-history>What did the Han dynasty contribute to history?</h2>
<p>Han dynasty authors wrote many essays and poems that are still studied in China’s schools. One Han writer, Sima Qian (SOOMUH CHIH»YIHN), wrote the first history of China. Much of what we know about the Shang, Zhou, and Qin dynasties comes from Sima Qian’s work. The Han are also remembered for philosophy.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-inventions-from-the-han-dynasty>Are there any inventions from the Han dynasty?</h2>
<p>“There were major inventions and developments in science and technology,” Robin D.S. Yates, the James McGill Professor in the Department of History and Classical Studies at McGill University in Montreal, explains. “As with all inventions, some of these only came into their own in later, sometimes much later times.”</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-houses-did-the-han-dynasty-build>What kind of houses did the Han dynasty build?</h2>
<p>They had a common culture. Even in remote sections, district officials copied the manner of how the imperial court was set up. The rich rushed to imitate the Imperial palace. They built elaborate homes, decorated with expensive curtains, and carpets. They built family tombs with stone lions.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-merchants-wear-in-the-han-dynasty>What did merchants wear in the Han dynasty?</h2>
<p>Even farmers and peasant outranked them, since they were of the 4th rank of the Han dynasty social hierarchy, while farmers and peasants were on the second. Registered merchants were required to wear white clothing to signify their low status.</p>
