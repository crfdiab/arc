<h2 id=how-many-people-live-within-60-miles-of-the-coast>How many people live within 60 miles of the coast?</h2>
<p>There are about 620,000 kilometers (372,000 miles) of coastline. Over one-third of the total human population, nearly 2.4 billion people, lives within 100 km (60 miles) of an oceanic coast, a fact emphasized by the devastating tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-people-live-within-50-miles-of-coast>What percentage of people live within 50 miles of coast?</h2>
<p>As of 2014, nearly 40% of the population lived in counties on the coast. Though home to almost 40% of the U.S. population, coastal areas account for less than 10% of the total land in the contiguous United States. In the U.S., 127 million people live in coastal counties.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-healthy-to-live-near-the-ocean>Is it healthy to live near the ocean?</h2>
<p>A recent UK study showed that, even discounting factors like age and economic factors, people who live by the sea are healthier than those who live away from the coast. Sea air encourages respiratory health, while sun exposure (with a healthy coating of SPF) is great for getting your daily dose of Vitamin D.</p>
<h2 id=is-living-by-the-sea-good-for-you>Is living by the sea good for you?</h2>
<p>The waves, sand, and ocean breezes are all a picture-perfect way to spend a vacation, bringing relaxation and stress relief almost the instant you begin to smell the salt air. Over time, living near the ocean can improve your health, reducing your risk of obesity, heart disease, and other illnesses.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-live-on-the-coast-of-the-world>How many people live on the coast of the world?</h2>
<p> More than 600 million people (around 10 per cent of the world’s population) live in coastal areas that are less than 10 meters above sea level.  Nearly 2.4 billion people (about 40 per cent of the world’s population) live within 100 km (60 miles) of the coast.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-percentage-of-people-living-in-coastal-areas>What’s the percentage of people living in coastal areas?</h2>
<p>Though home to almost 40% of the U.S. population, coastal areas account for less than 10% of the total land in the contiguous United States.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-live-in-the-ocean-area>How many people live in the ocean area?</h2>
<p> The ocean is vast, covering 140 million square miles (363 million square km), equivalent to approximately 72 per cent of the earth’s surface.  More than 600 million people (around 10 per cent of the world’s population) live in coastal areas that are less than 10 meters above sea level.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-population-growing-along-the-coast>How is the population growing along the coast?</h2>
<p>Population will grow along various coastlines and in already densely populated developing countries. The number of people living within 60 miles of coastlines will increase by about 35 percent compared to 1995, the mapmakers say.</p>
