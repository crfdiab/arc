<h2 id=how-was-sputnik-made>How was Sputnik made?</h2>
<p>Sputnik was a polished metal sphere made of aluminum alloy. It was 23 inches (58 cm) in diameter – about the size of a beach ball – and weighed just 184 pounds (83 kilograms). Its four external radio antennae were meant to broadcast radio pulses. And broadcast they did.</p>
<h2 id=what-influenced-sputnik>What influenced Sputnik?</h2>
<p>Politically, Sputnik created a perception of American weakness, complacency, and a “missile gap,” which led to bitter accusations, resignations of key military figures, and contributed to the election of John F. Kennedy, who emphasized the space gap and the role of the Eisenhower-Nixon administration in creating it.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-sputnik-get-into-space>How did Sputnik get into space?</h2>
<p>Sputnik’s 1 greatest achievement was actually getting into space. It did this atop a rocket whose design was derived from the Soviet Union’s development of the world’s first intercontinental ballistic missile – the R-7 ‘Semyorka’. The rocket that carried Sputnik 1, on the launch pad in 1957.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-sputnik-so-important>Why was Sputnik so important?</h2>
<p>On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the earth’s first artificial satellite, Sputnik-1. As a result, the launch of Sputnik served to intensify the arms race and raise Cold War tensions. During the 1950s, both the United States and the Soviet Union were working to develop new technology.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-soviet-union-launch-sputnik-1-and-2>When did the Soviet Union launch Sputnik 1 and 2?</h2>
<p>The launches of Sputnik 1 and 2 by the Soviet Union in October and November 1957, respectively, and the implied Soviet superiority in missile technology, galvanized the United States.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-sputnik-work-and-how-did-it-work>How did Sputnik work and how did it work?</h2>
<p>It would be triggered by a sensor at the moment of separation of the launch vehicle and the satellite, and a one-watt radio transmitter emitted signals lasting 0.4 seconds with a wavelength of 7 and 15 meters.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-when-sputnik-went-into-orbit>Who was president when Sputnik went into orbit?</h2>
<p>When Sputnik went into orbit in 1957, America went into a panic. Only President Dwight Eisenhower retained his composure and understood that the United States was far superior to the Soviet Union in scientific research as well as in military firepower.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-sputnik-compared-to-the-first-us-satellite>How big was Sputnik compared to the first US satellite?</h2>
<p>Sputnik was some 10 times the size of the first planned U.S. satellite, which was not scheduled to be launched until the next year. The U.S. government, military, and scientific community were caught off guard by the Soviet technological achievement, and their united efforts to catch up with the Soviets heralded the beginning of the “space race.”</p>
