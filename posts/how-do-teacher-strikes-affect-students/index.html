<h2 id=how-do-teacher-strikes-affect-students>How do teacher strikes affect students?</h2>
<p>Based on a difference-in-differences approach, using data from two different surveys, we find some evidence that the strikes reduced educational attainment and increased class repetition. We also find that the strikes led to a significant reallocation of students to a lower level of higher education.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-teacher-performance-affect-student-learning>How does teacher performance affect student learning?</h2>
<p>A teacher’s influence, ideas, and expectations of his or her students’ capabilities have an effect on student academic performance and achievements. When students are viewed in a negative way by their teachers such as, being lazy, unmotivated and having no abilities, they take on those beliefs about themselves.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-strikes-in-schools>What are the effects of strikes in schools?</h2>
<p>The effects of the strikes were identified as destruction of school property, suspension and expulsion of students, beating up of teachers, imprisonment of ringleaders, slaughtering of school animals, closure of schools and inevitably poor academic performance among others.</p>
<h2 id=do-teacher-strikes-harm-educational-attainment-of-students>Do teacher strikes harm educational attainment of students?</h2>

<h2 id=how-can-a-teacher-improve-learners-performance>How can a teacher improve learners performance?</h2>
<p>Believing in the students and offering support throughout the school year can help improve their achievement levels.

<h2 id=what-adverse-effect-has-the-strike-had-on-education-in-south-africa>What adverse effect has the strike had on education in South Africa?</h2>
<p>Results indicate that teacher strike participation negatively affects learning for students in the poorest three quarters of schools in South Africa. A negative effect size as large as ten per cent of a standard deviation is observed.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-school-strike-mean>What does school strike mean?</h2>
<p>A common tactic of student protest is to go on strike (sometimes called a boycott of classes), which occurs when students enrolled at a teaching institution such as a school, college or university refuse to go to class.</p>
