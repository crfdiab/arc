<h2 id=what-was-forbidden-in-georgia>What was forbidden in Georgia?</h2>
<p>During the colonial era, the practice of slavery in Georgia soon became surpassed by industrial-scale plantation slavery. The colony of the Province of Georgia under James Oglethorpe banned slavery in 1735, the only one of the thirteen colonies to have done so.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-religious-groups-were-initially-banned-from-joining-the-colony>What two religious groups were initially banned from joining the colony?</h2>
<p>What two religious groups were initially banned from joining the colony? The Puritans and Pilgrims arrived in New England in the early 1600s after suffering religious persecution in England. However, the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay Colony didn’t tolerate any opposing religious views.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-prohibited-by-georgia-first-charter>What was prohibited by Georgia First charter?</h2>
<p>Trustees were forbidden by the charter from holding office or land in Georgia, nor were they paid. Presumably, their motives for serving were humanitarian, and their motto was Non sibi sed aliis (“Not for self, but for others”).</p>
<h2 id=what-religion-was-the-georgia-colony>What religion was the Georgia colony?</h2>
<p>Church of England</p>
<table><tr><th>Province of Georgia</th></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td>Colony (Kingdom of Great Britain)</td></tr><tr><td>Capital</td><td>Savannah</td></tr><tr><td>Common languages</td><td>English, Mikasuki, Cherokee, Muscogee, Shawnee, Yuchi</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Church of England (Anglicanism)</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-did-the-trustees-not-allow-slavery-in-georgia>Why did the trustees not allow slavery in Georgia?</h2>
<p>The Georgia Trustees prohibited slavery because it conflicted with their vision of small landowners prospering from their own labor. They also wanted Georgia to serve as a military buffer between the English colonies and Spanish Florida.</p>
<h2 id=who-wanted-slavery-in-georgia>Who wanted slavery in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Its two most important leaders were a Lowland Scot named Patrick Tailfer and Thomas Stephens, the son of William Stephens, the Trustees’ secretary in Georgia. They and their band of supporters bombarded the Trustees with letters and petitions demanding that slavery be permitted in Georgia.</p>
<h2 id=what-groups-came-to-america-for-religious-freedom>What groups came to America for religious freedom?</h2>
<p>In the storybook version most of us learned in school, the Pilgrims came to America aboard the Mayflower in search of religious freedom in 1620. The Puritans soon followed, for the same reason.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-only-trustee-to-come-to-georgia>Who was the only trustee to come to Georgia?</h2>
<p>General Oglethorpe<br>
The Trustees ruled Georgia for 21 years, but the only Trustee who ever stepped foot in the colony was General Oglethorpe. Oglethorpe spent ten years in Georgia until he returned to England for good in 1744.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-rum-banned-in-georgia>Why was rum banned in Georgia?</h2>
<p>First, due to the idea that the colony would be one for the “worthy poor,” the Trustees forbade rum (alcohol) and slavery in fears that both would make the colonists lazy and unwilling to work hard. Second, the trustees barred liquor dealers, lawyers, and Catholics from the colony.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-georgia-a-good-colony>Why was Georgia a good colony?</h2>
<p>Because of the warm climate in the Georgia Colony, and the good agricultural land, it was possible to grow crops all year and plantations thrived.</p>
<h2 id=did-georgia-colony-have-religious-freedom>Did Georgia colony have religious freedom?</h2>
<p>From its founding in 1732 throughout the eighteenth century, Georgia was a place of both religious tolerance and religious pluralism. Georgia’s Royal Charter provided for liberty of conscience for all, and for the free exercise of religion by all except Roman Catholics.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-only-religion-allowed-in-georgia>What was the only religion allowed in Georgia?</h2>
<p>From the Foltz Photography Studio Photographs, MS 1360. Although Catholicism was the only religion expressly forbidden in the charter, the Georgia Trustees also decided to forbid Judaism in the new colony, but the harsh realities of colonial life opened the doors for Judaism to enter Georgia.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-catholicism-not-take-root-in-georgia>Why did Catholicism not take root in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Because of the ban, Catholicism did not take root in Georgia again until after the American Revolution. However, many other religious groups flourished in Georgia under Oglethorpe’s leadership.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-religion-did-oglethorpe-have-in-georgia>What kind of religion did Oglethorpe have in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Oglethorpe, in defiance of his fellow trustees, went further by allowing the Jewish immigrants to own land in the new colony. They founded the Temple Mickve Israel, the third-oldest Jewish congregation in America and the oldest in the South.</p>
