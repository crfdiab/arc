<h2 id=when-was-the-sao-paulo-temple-built>When was the Sao Paulo Temple built?</h2>
<p>Plans to construct the temple were announced 1 March 1975, Church leaders broke ground 20 March 1976, and Spencer W. Kimball, president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1973 to 1985, dedicated the São Paulo Brazil Temple 30 October 1978.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-recife-important-to-brazil>Why is Recife important to Brazil?</h2>
<p>It is an Atlantic seaport located at the confluence of the Capibaribe and Beberibe rivers. Recife has been called the Venice of Brazil because the city is crossed by waterways and its component parts are linked by numerous bridges.</p>
<h2 id=is-recife-brazil-poor>Is Recife Brazil poor?</h2>
<p>One of the richest cities in the world Now, Recife is the 4th most densely populated city in Brazil (behind São Paulo, Rio and Belo Horizonte). Although the North-East region of Brazil is one of the poorest in the country, Recife is set to be one of the richest cities in the world.</p>

<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-shark-attacks-in-recife>Why are there so many shark attacks in Recife?</h2>
<p>Many Recife locals believe that the real cause of the increased shark activity was the building of the nearby Suape Port, and the environmental degradation that followed. Originally, four rivers converged into the Bay of Suape.</p>
<h2 id=how-safe-is-recife-brazil>How safe is Recife Brazil?</h2>
<p>Recife does have a high crime rate with incidents of gang violence very high, so travelers should always be wary of their surroundings. Even when in areas of hight tourism. Petty criminals such as muggers and pickpockets operate throughout the city, and even organised scams are common.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-dutch-invade-brazil>Why did Dutch invade Brazil?</h2>
<p>Dutch Brazil, also known as New Holland, was the northern portion of the Portuguese colony of Brazil, ruled by the Dutch during the Dutch colonization of the Americas between 1630 and 1654. The governor, Johan Maurits, invited artists and scientists to the colony to help promote Brazil and increase immigration.</p>
