<h2 id=how-many-galaxies-are-there-in-the-milky-way>How many galaxies are there in the Milky Way?</h2>
<p>two trillion galaxies<br>
But we know more than that, and our modern estimate is even grander: two trillion galaxies. Here’s how we got there. Our deepest galaxy surveys can reveal objects tens of billions of light years away, but even with…</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-jupiter-and-saturn-align>What happens when Jupiter and Saturn align?</h2>
<p>When they line up, their vibrations blend and work together. A Great Conjunction happens when Jupiter and Saturn align. Both planets are associated with authority, but each very differently.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-rarest-celestial-event>What is the rarest celestial event?</h2>
<p>10 Rarest And Amazing Astronomical Events</p>
<ul>
<li>8 Hale- Bopp comet.</li>
<li>7 Halley’s comet.</li>
<li>6 Comet ISON.</li>
<li>5 Planetary Alignment.</li>
<li>4 Great White Thunder Storm.</li>
<li>3 Venus Transition.</li>
<li>2 Blue Moon.</li>
<li>1 Total Solar Eclipse.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-the-4-types-of-galaxies>What is the 4 types of galaxies?</h2>
<p>In 1936, Hubble debuted a way to classify galaxies, grouping them into four main types: spiral galaxies, lenticular galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and irregular galaxies.</p>
<h2 id=can-humans-travel-to-another-galaxy>Can humans travel to another galaxy?</h2>
<p>The technology required to travel between galaxies is far beyond humanity’s present capabilities, and currently only the subject of speculation, hypothesis, and science fiction. However, theoretically speaking, there is nothing to conclusively indicate that intergalactic travel is impossible.</p>
<h2 id=what-planets-will-align-in-2022>What planets will align in 2022?</h2>
<p>Next conjunctions: A conjunction between Venus and Mars will take place on July 13, 2021. In 2022, there will be a conjunction of Mars and Saturn on April 5, 2022, and Jupiter and Venus on April 30, 2022, and conjunction of Mars and Jupiter on May 29, 2020.</p>
<h2 id=is-jupiter-going-to-explode>Is Jupiter going to explode?</h2>
<p>Objects less massive than that can never achieve the core temperatures required for thermonuclear reactions. This corresponds to about 13 times the mass of Jupiter, meaning that Jupiter itself is incapable of ever ‘igniting’. Jupiter lies pretty close to the limit of what we’d call a gas giant.</p>
<h2 id=what-space-events-will-happen-in-2022>What space events will happen in 2022?</h2>
<ul>
<li>January 2 – New Moon.</li>
<li>January 3, 4 – Quadrantids Meteor Shower.</li>
<li>January 7 – Mercury at Greatest Eastern Elongation.</li>
<li>January 17 – Full Moon.</li>
<li>February 1 – New Moon.</li>
<li>February 16 – Full Moon.</li>
<li>February 16 – Mercury at Greatest Western Elongation.</li>
<li>March 2 – New Moon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-the-rarest-moon-color>What is the rarest moon color?</h2>
<p>Blue<br>
Blue-colored moons are rare – aren’t necessarily full – and happen when Earth’s atmosphere contains dust or smoke particles of a certain size. The particles must be slightly wider than 900 nanometers.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-time-of-night-to-stargaze>What is the best time of night to stargaze?</h2>
<p>The best time to go stargazing is the days before, during and soon after each new Moon, when there is no Moon in the sky. During these times there is no bright Moon to wash out the light from fainter stars.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-switch-galaxies-with-a-portal-address>Can you switch galaxies with a portal address?</h2>
<p>You can’t switch galaxies with portal addresses, either. Answer: you play for an hour maybe, then you get out the backup from before leaving and camp at the core! I’ve done that twice, both times returning back to a place surrounded by stars with the word “Contact”.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-i-go-to-a-new-galaxy>What happens if I go to a new galaxy?</h2>
<p>If they join your game they will travel to your galaxy, and if you join theirs you will travel to the first galaxy (Euclid). 3. You don’t lose anything, when you arrive in the second galaxy most of your equipment and ship is broken and you have to repair.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-an-object-travel-to-another-galaxy>How does an object travel to another galaxy?</h2>
<p>Supernova explosion in the binary system and star ejection from the supermassive black hole are some common solutions. When an object moves at the speed of light, Time Dilation takes place. This shortens the time needed to travel to another galaxy with respect to the traveler.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-will-it-take-to-travel-to-another-star-system>How long will it take to travel to another star system?</h2>
<p>BIS is still functional and people working there are very hopeful that humans will reach a different star system by the end of this century. Alpha Centauri is the basis of this claim. It is about 4.4 light years away from the center of our Solar System. An object moving at 10% of the speed of light can complete this journey in about 44 years.</p>
