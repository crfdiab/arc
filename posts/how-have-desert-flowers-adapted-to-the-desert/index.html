<h2 id=how-have-desert-flowers-adapted-to-the-desert>How have desert flowers adapted to the desert?</h2>
<p>Desert Plant Adaptations Many plants have long root systems spread out wide or go deep into the ground to absorb water; Short life cycles – some plants germinate in response to rain, grow, flower, and die within one year. These plants can therefore avoid drought.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-ways-that-desert-plants-are-adapted-to-the-desert-environment>What are 3 ways that desert plants are adapted to the desert environment?</h2>
<p>How plants adapt to arid conditions</p>
<ul>
<li>thick, waxy skin to reduce loss of water and to reflect heat.</li>
<li>large, fleshy stems to store water.</li>
<li>thorns and thin, spiky or glossy leaves to reduce water loss.</li>
<li>spikes protect cacti from animals wishing to use stored water.</li>
<li>deep roots to tap groundwater.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-does-the-desert-lily-adapt-to-the-desert>How does the desert lily adapt to the desert?</h2>
<p>Adaptation to the Desert: It possesses barbs instead of leaves to prevent water from evaporating and to defend itself against animals, and their green structures are actually stems to hold water. This bulb is part of the reason for this plants ability to survive the desert. …</p>
<h2 id=what-adaptation-helps-desert-plants-keep-animals-away>What adaptation helps desert plants keep animals away?</h2>
<p>The leaves and stems of many desert plants have a thick, waxy covering. This waxy substance does not cover the stomata, but it covers most of the leaves, keeping the plants cooler and reducing evaporative loss.</p>
<h2 id=what-eats-a-desert-lily-in-the-desert>What eats a desert lily in the desert?</h2>
<p>Three species of herbivores are known to eat the leaves of this lily: a small antelope, the dorcas gazelle Gazella dorcasa moth larva Polytella cliensand a land snail Eremina desertorum.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-plants-adapted-to-live-in-the-desert>How are plants adapted to live in the desert?</h2>
<p>Plants develop several adaptations to enable them to preserve water. One way these plants reduce water intake is through the reduced size of the leaves or completely no leaves. Without the leaves, the plant won’t be losing water through transpiration.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-deciduous-plants-shed-their-leaves-in-the-desert>Why do deciduous plants shed their leaves in the desert?</h2>
<p>They trap moisture near the plant. Deciduous plants lose their leaves for part of the year, this is convenient for desert plants because that means less water loss. An example is the Ocotillo plant, which sheds its leaves during the dry and hot months and then will regrow them in the cooler months.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-plants-do-animals-eat-in-the-desert>What kind of plants do animals eat in the desert?</h2>
<p>Hunger and thirst draw animals to plants, but many desert plants have spines and thorns, such as the barrel cactus, that can harm an animal that attempts to eat it. Many of these plants are also toxic, such as the desert thorn-apple, and some are both spiny and toxic.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-life-cycle-of-a-desert-plant>What’s the life cycle of a desert plant?</h2>
<p>Plants that germinate in the fall grow slowly through the winter and flower in the spring, after which they die before the scathing summer begins. The plant life cycle continues through the seeds produced.</p>
