<h2 id=what-are-the-main-recyclables-in-mauritius>What are the main recyclables in Mauritius?</h2>
<p>Plastic, metal cans, paper, glass, cartons and electronics are the main household recyclables. Plastic waste is the trickiest of all recyclables since different types of plastic have different recycling properties.</p>
<h2 id=which-countries-are-known-to-recycle-paper-the-most>Which countries are known to recycle paper the most?</h2>
<p>Germany has the best recycling rate in the world. Austria comes in second, followed by South Korea and Wales. All four countries manage to recycle between 52% and 56% of their municipal waste.</p>
<h2 id=is-paper-being-recycled>Is paper being recycled?</h2>
<p>Paper is a material that we’re used to recycling, since 87 percent of us have access to curbside or drop-off recycling for paper. Additionally, 76 percent of paper mills used some recovered paper in 2011, so the paper you throw into the bin is finding its way into plenty of new products.</p>
<h2 id=who-started-recycling-paper>Who started recycling paper?</h2>
<p>1031. There is evidence that documents the existence of paper recycling in Japan, although it is assumed that their Chinese neighbours —the inventors of paper— were the first to begin recycling and that the procedure travelled to Japan from China.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-landfill-found-in-mauritius>Where is landfill found in Mauritius?</h2>
<p>​The Wastes disposal sites comprise the Mare Chicose Sanitary Landfill and five transfer stations located across the island. Waste collection services provided mainly by Local Authorities. A compost plant with a capacity of 300 tonnes of waste daily, set up by a private promoter, is also operational at La Chaumiere.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-solid-waste-management>What is meant by solid waste management?</h2>
<p>Solid-waste management, the collecting, treating, and disposing of solid material that is discarded because it has served its purpose or is no longer useful.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-the-best-recycling>Which country has the best recycling?</h2>
<p>Top five best recycling countries</p>
<ol>
<li>Germany – 56.1% Since 2016, Germany has had the highest recycling rate in the world, with 56.1% of all waste it produced last year being recycled.</li>
<li>Austria – 53.8%</li>
<li>South Korea – 53.7%</li>
<li>Wales – 52.2%</li>
<li>Switzerland – 49.7%</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-invent-recycling>Who was the first person to invent recycling?</h2>
<p>Who invented recycling? No-one in particular. As long as there have been raw materials, there has been recycling. But 23 year old Gary Anderson created the modern concept of recycling with his Mobius Loop logo, which is associated with the ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’ slogan.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-recycle-at-home-in-mauritius>Is it possible to recycle at home in Mauritius?</h2>
<p>While kerbside collection of recyclable household waste is non-existent in Mauritius, local recycling initiatives do nonetheless exist. As we marked World Environment Day on Wednesday, Weekly looks into how to start recycling at home. Recycling in Mauritius is a nascent phenomenon.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-milk-cartons-not-recyclable-in-mauritius>Why are milk cartons not recyclable in Mauritius?</h2>
<p>Juice, soup and milk cartons are recycled abroad. In Mauritius, however, they are still considered as non-recyclable. The technology and expertise required to handle their recycling are yet to reach our shores. Cartons contain distinct linings of paper, plastic and aluminium which render their recycling cumbersome.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-so-much-waste-in-mauritius>Why is there so much waste in Mauritius?</h2>
<p>Mauritius is an island undergoing major development and as the level of consumption increases, so does the level of waste production. Waste production obviously cannot be haltered and so ways to deal with them must be found.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-littering-affect-the-environment-in-mauritius>How does littering affect the environment in Mauritius?</h2>
<p>Littering is a habit Mauritians are yet to break free from. It is even more deplorable when much of the litter strewing our environment is actually recyclable. While kerbside collection of recyclable household waste is non-existent in Mauritius, local recycling initiatives do nonetheless exist.</p>
