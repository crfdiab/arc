<h2 id=why-is-brazil-the-only-portuguese-speaking-country>Why is Brazil the only Portuguese-speaking country?</h2>
<p>Reply: Brazil is the largest country in South America and is the only Portuguese-speaking country in the Americas. It is the world’s fifth-largest country, both in geography and in population. The reason Brazilians speak Portuguese is because Brazil was colonized by Portugal, but the history is a bit more complex.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-portugal-speak-portuguese>Why does Portugal speak Portuguese?</h2>
<p>In 1143, Portugal was recognized as an independent kingdom. In 1290, the king of Portugal, Denis, created the first university in Lisbon and declared that the spoken language of Vulgar Latin be used and that it should be called Portuguese.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-cause-of-a-large-portuguese-speaking-population-in-brazil>What is the cause of a large Portuguese-speaking population in Brazil?</h2>
<p>C. Portugal had established a colony in Brazil in the past. Explanation: The Portuguese language arrived on Brazilian territory aboard Portuguese ships in the 16th century to join the Tupi-Guarani language family, especially Tupinambá, one of the Tupi dialects.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-race-is-portuguese>What kind of race is Portuguese?</h2>
<p>The Portuguese are a Southwestern European population, with origins predominantly from Southern and Western Europe. The earliest modern humans inhabiting Portugal are believed to have been Paleolithic peoples that may have arrived in the Iberian Peninsula as early as 35,000 to 40,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-older-spanish-or-portuguese>Which is older Spanish or Portuguese?</h2>
<p>Starting with Marcelo Serrado’s answer, Portugal is certainly older than Spain. In terms of its borders is certainly older than Spain and one of the oldest in Europe.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-in-brazil-speak-portuguese-language>Why do people in Brazil speak Portuguese language?</h2>
<p>In Brazil we speak Portuguese simply because we were colonized by Portugal.And the Brazilian territorial expansion went far beyond the tordesillas treaty line for several reasons, such as the action of the bandeirantes and cattle ranching. Come visit our country and know our history.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-brazil-become-a-colony-of-portugal>Why did Brazil become a colony of Portugal?</h2>
<p>Brazil was a colony of Portugal, from about 1500 until their independence in the 1820s, unlike the other South American countries that were colonised by Spain. Given that the natives were in low number, scattered as multiple tribes and vulnerable to diseases born by the colonisers, native languages were supplanted by Portuguese.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-portuguese-colony-in-the-world>Which is the largest Portuguese colony in the world?</h2>
<p>1 Angola. Becoming a Portuguese colony in 1575, Angola celebrated 35 years of independence on 11th November 2010. 2 Brazil. The huge South American country of Brazil became a Portuguese colony in 1500. 3 Cape Verde. 4 Equatorial Guinea. 5 Mozambique. 6 Macau. 7 Goa</p>
<h2 id=when-did-brazil-break-free-from-the-portuguese-empire>When did Brazil break free from the Portuguese Empire?</h2>
<p>For more than 200 years, Brazil was one of the most important colonies of the Portuguese empire. But on September 7, 1822, Brazil broke free from Portugal. Dom Pedro, Emperor Dom João’s son and his father’s acting regent in the colony, added his support to Brazilian nationalists and declared the country’s independence of the Portuguese homeland.</p>
