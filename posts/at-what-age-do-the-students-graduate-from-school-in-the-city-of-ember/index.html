<h2 id=at-what-age-do-the-students-graduate-from-school-in-the-city-of-ember>At what age do the students graduate from school in the city of Ember?</h2>
<p>At age 12, the children of Ember graduate from school and take jobs maintaining their community.</p>
<h2 id=what-grade-level-is-city-of-ember>What grade level is City of Ember?</h2>
<p>The City of Ember: The First Book of Ember</p>
<table><tr><th>Interest Level</th><th>Reading Level</th><th>Reading A-Z</th></tr><tr><td>Grades 4 – 8</td><td>Grades 3 – 8</td><td>W</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-does-city-ember-end>How does city ember end?</h2>
<p>At the very very end, Mrs. Murdo is walking alone. The message that Lina and Doon toss down from the upper world falls at her feet, and she begins to untie it (and, presumably, to read it). Let’s rewind a bit: Lina and Doon and Poppy escape Ember—woohoo!</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-jobs-in-city-of-ember>What are the jobs in City of Ember?</h2>
<p>The jobs included messenger, pipeworks helper, greenhouse keeper, street sweeper, electricians helper, cart puller, doctors assistance, and supply depot clerk.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-bad-jobs-in-the-city-of-ember>What are bad jobs in The City of Ember?</h2>
<p>Some years there are mostly bad jobs like Pipeworks laborer, trash sifter, and mold scraper, but Ember always needs electrician’s helpers.</p>
<h2 id=is-city-of-ember-ok-for-kids>Is City of Ember OK for kids?</h2>
<p>THE CITY OF EMBER is an entertaining book for young readers. The book may contain some material that may upset or frighten young children.</p>
<h2 id=is-city-of-ember-a-series>Is City of Ember a series?</h2>
<p>It is the first “Book of Ember” in the eponymous series, which also includes The People of Sparks, The Prophet of Yonwood (a prequel), and the final installment, The Diamond of Darkhold. In 2008, the book was adapted into a film by Walden Media and Playtone.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-problem-in-city-of-ember>What is the problem in city of Ember?</h2>
<p>A central conflict in “The City of Ember” is the dying underground city. The city suffers from a food shortage, and it is running low on electricity because the central generator is out of fuel. Lina and Doon discover that government corruption has led to the dire circumstances and hostage-like living conditions.</p>
<h2 id=why-don-t-the-people-know-the-actual-date-of-ember>Why don t the people know the actual date of Ember?</h2>
<p>Poor timekeeping ties in with the major premise of the book, since the Builders could only give the city enough provisions to last about 200 to 220 years. Therefore, if the actual year is closer to 250, then the city is very close to disintegration, and the citizens must find their way out.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-builders-of-the-city-of-ember>Who are the builders of the city of Ember?</h2>
<p>As the book starts off a coalition of architects, scientists, and doctors known as “The Builders” have assembled Ember, an isolated city with supplies for its inhabitants to survive at least 200 years, to elude an impending disaster.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-main-characters-in-the-book-ember>Who are the main characters in the book Ember?</h2>
<p>The story is about Ember, a city threatened by aging infrastructure. The young protagonist, Lina Mayfleet, and her friend, Doon Harrow (the second protagonist), follow clues left behind by the original builders of the City of Ember, to safety in the outside world.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-linas-sister-in-the-city-of-ember>Who is Lina’s sister in the city of Ember?</h2>
<p>Lina’s younger sister, Poppy, exposes the instructions left by the Builders, but in teething leaves them almost illegible. Later, Lina asks Doon to help her reconstruct the paper. After much trial and error, she and Doon decipher the instructions from the Builders, which inform them of how to exit the city of Ember.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-fugitives-in-the-city-of-ember>Who are the fugitives in the city of Ember?</h2>
<p>Now fugitives from the Mayor’s police, Lina and Doon, accompanied by Lina’s little sister Poppy, use the instructions and assistance from Sul to flee the city via a subterranean river. When the repercussions of their actions trigger a panic in Ember City, the Mayor locks himself in his vault, only to be devoured by the giant mole.</p>
