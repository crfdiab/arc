<h2 id=what-impact-did-the-french-have-on-the-natives>What impact did the French have on the natives?</h2>
<p>French-Native relations also brought chaos to the region. The fur trade brought the spread of guns, contagious diseases, and alcohol. French demand for Native slaves resulted in Native people raiding other Indigenous communities.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-the-french-and-dutch-fur-trade-have-on-native-americans>What impact did the French and Dutch fur trade have on Native Americans?</h2>
<p>French and Dutch colonization in the Americans focused on the profitable fur trade. Depending on Native Americans to hunt animals for their pelts, French and Dutch colonizers cultivated friendly relationships with Native Americans through intermarriage and military alliances.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-fur-trade-affect-indigenous-peoples>How did the fur trade affect indigenous peoples?</h2>
<p>The introduction of the fur trade had a profound effect on their way of life, however. There was increased conflict between the Anishinaabe and the Haudenosaunee as they competed for control of the St. The Indigenous peoples became dependent on the trading posts for firearms and ammunition and for European food.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-france-treat-the-native-american>How did France treat the Native American?</h2>
<p>They respected Native territories, their ways, and treated them as the human beings they were. The Natives, in turn, treated the French as trusted friends. More intermarriages took place between French settlers and Native Americans than with any other European group. The Natives did not appreciate any of this.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-france-have-the-best-relationship-with-native-americans>Why did France have the best relationship with Native Americans?</h2>
<p>The French enjoyed much better relations with Native Americans than other European groups when they first came to American shores. The main reason is that they did not try to change the Natives. They also did not compete with the Natives for land.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-french-fur-trade>What was the impact of the French fur trade?</h2>
<p>Impact of the French Fur Trade on the Lives of Native Deborah Snow Presented to the American Culture Faculty June 8, 1999 First Reader: Dr. Bruce A. Rubenstein ^ 2 ^ Impact of the French Fur Trade on the Lives of Native</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-fur-trade-change-native-american-society>How did the fur trade change Native American Society?</h2>
<p>Participation in the fur trade transformed Native American societies profoundly. Many of these societies had previously been communal and mostly horticultural. The growth of trade increased the role of hunting and led communities to fragment into smaller family units as the concepts of private property and individualism began to emerge.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-iroquois-wars-affect-the-fur-trade>How did the Iroquois Wars affect the fur trade?</h2>
<p>The Iroquois wars were particularly destructive, and many refugee Indians who fled into Wisconsin suffered from starvation and warfare with the two indigenous tribes, the Menominee and Ho-Chunk. The Iroquois wars disrupted the flow of furs to the French colony of Quebec.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-europeans-get-their-furs-from>Where did the Europeans get their furs from?</h2>
<p>Beavers were almost extinct in Europe but were plentiful in North America and possessed high-quality pelts. The first Europeans to purchase furs from Indians were French and English fishermen who, during the 1500s, fished off the coast of northeastern Canada and occasionally traded with the Indians.</p>
