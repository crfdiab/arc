<h2 id=why-did-andrew-jackson-threaten-to-send-troops-to-south-carolina>Why did Andrew Jackson threaten to send troops to South Carolina?</h2>
<p>When South Carolina threatened to secede if it were forced to pay the tariffs, U.S. Pres. Andrew Jackson said that “disunion by armed force is treason.” Some three decades later, 11 Southern states claimed that their sovereignty gave them the right to secede from the union.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-president-jackson-do-after-putting-the-force-bill-in-place>What did President Jackson do after putting the Force Bill in place?</h2>
<p>Andrew Jackson declared that states did not have the right of nullification and asked Congress for authority to collect the tariff by force if necessary. Congress responded with the Force Bill. The law allowed the president to relocate customs houses and to require that customs duties be paid in cash.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-force-bill-authorize-jackson>What did the Force Bill authorize Jackson?</h2>
<p>Answer: The Force Bill authorized President Andrew Jackson to use military power to force South Carolina to collect customs duties in the state.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-andrew-jackson-veto-the-bill>Why did Andrew Jackson veto the bill?</h2>
<p>Andrew Jackson vetoed the bill re-chartering the Second Bank in July 1832 by arguing that in the form presented to him it was incompatible with “justice,” “sound policy” and the Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-andrew-jackson-support-individual-liberty>How did Andrew Jackson support individual liberty?</h2>
<p>Jackson was elected the seventh president of the United States in 1828. Known as the “people’s president,” Jackson destroyed the Second Bank of the United States, founded the Democratic Party, supported individual liberty and instituted policies that resulted in the forced migration of Native Americans.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-south-carolina-threaten-to-secede-from-the-us>When did South Carolina threaten to secede from the US?</h2>
<p>South Carolina Threatens to Secede from the United States November 24, 1832 At this time there are many national troubles, especially between the government of the United States and the state of South Carolina.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-nullification-crisis-affect-south-carolina>How did the Nullification Crisis affect South Carolina?</h2>
<p>The Nullification Crisis came about in 1832 after South Carolina declared that the Federal Tariffs signed into law by President Andrew Jackson were unconstitutional. After the national economy began to fall, South Carolina found itself hardest hit due to tariffs placed by the federal government during the War of 1812.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-south-carolina-hardest-hit-by-the-war-of-1812>Why was South Carolina hardest hit by the war of 1812?</h2>
<p>After the national economy began to fall, South Carolina found itself hardest hit due to tariffs placed by the federal government during the War of 1812. South Carolina convened and declared that all such tariffs were unconstitutional and therefore null inside state boundaries.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-tariff-raised-in-south-carolina>Why was the Tariff raised in South Carolina?</h2>
<p>The tariff was raised in order to protect Northern manufacturing interests. South Carolina stated that they would not enforce the tariff and threatened secession. This was important because the most prominent South Carolinian politician of the day, John C. Calhoun, was Andrew Jackson’s vice-president.</p>
