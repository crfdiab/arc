<p>the Chief Justice<br>
The judiciary is headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who, like the other justices, is appointed by the President on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-head-of-the-judiciary-at-the-state-level>Who is the head of the judiciary at the state level?</h2>
<p>High Courts may even take appeals from lower courts. High Court judges are appointed by the President of India upon consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Chief Justice of the High Court and the Governor of the State. District Courts are presided over by District Judges.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-judges-of-supreme-court-of-india-appointed>How are judges of Supreme Court of India appointed?</h2>
<p>The Constitution of India lays down the rules for the appointment of the judges of the Supreme Court, High Courts and District Courts. The judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President of India in consultation with the Chief Justice.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-structure-of-the-judiciary-in-india>What is the structure of the judiciary in India?</h2>
<p>The judiciary in India has a pyramidal structure with the Supreme Court (SC) at the top. High Courts are below the SC, and below them are the district and subordinate courts. The lower courts function under the direct superintendence of the higher courts. The diagram below gives the structure and organisation of the judicial system in the country.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-duties-of-the-chief-justice-of-india>What are the duties of the Chief Justice of India?</h2>
<p>On the administrative side, the chief justice carries out the following functions: maintenance of the roster; appointment of court officials and general and miscellaneous matters relating to the supervision and functioning of the Supreme Court. However this convention has been broken twice.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-founder-of-the-indian-judicial-system>Who was the founder of the Indian judicial system?</h2>
<p>Though given a start by Warren Hastings, the system was stabilized by Cornwallis in 1793. In each district was established a Diwani Adalat, or civil court, presided over by the District Judge who belonged to the Civil Service. Cornwallis thus separated the posts of the Civil Judge and the Collector.</p>
