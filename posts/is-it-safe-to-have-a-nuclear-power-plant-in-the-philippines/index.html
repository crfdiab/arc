<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-have-a-nuclear-power-plant-in-the-philippines>Is it safe to have a nuclear power plant in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Natib, scientists have advised against reviving the nuclear plant. However, officials from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology had declared the site of the plant is safe noting the facility’s solid foundation and the dormancy of the nearby volcano Mount Natib.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-philippines-ready-to-have-a-functioning-nuclear-powerplant-why>Is the Philippines ready to have a functioning nuclear powerplant Why?</h2>
<p>On the government side, DOE Undersecretary Donato Marcos explained that the department is considering nuclear power because of its capability to provide 75 percent of the country’s base load requirement. “Strong economic growth and rising population will require more energy, plus the need for increased power capacity.</p>
<h2 id=is-having-a-nuclear-power-plant-in-the-philippines-advantageous>Is having a nuclear power plant in the Philippines advantageous?</h2>
<p>By embracing nuclear energy, the Philippines could both lower its CO2 emissions and ensure a steady supply of abundant electricity, experts say. The country could rejuvenate the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant or construct new plants, or both.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-think-philippines-is-ready-for-nuclear-power>Do you think Philippines is ready for nuclear power?</h2>
<p>The Department of Energy yesterday formally received an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report on the Philippines’ capability to adopt nuclear energy for electricity generation.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-bataan-nuclear-power-plant>What are the disadvantages of Bataan nuclear power plant?</h2>
<p>Here are some of the main cons of nuclear energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Expensive to Build. Despite being relatively inexpensive to operate, nuclear power plants are incredibly expensive to build—and the cost keeps rising.</li>
<li>Accidents.</li>
<li>Produces Radioactive Waste.</li>
<li>Impact on the Environment.</li>
<li>Security Threat.</li>
<li>Limited Fuel Supply.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=is-nuclear-energy-safe-2020>Is nuclear energy safe 2020?</h2>
<p>The evidence over six decades shows that nuclear power is a safe means of generating electricity. The risk of accidents in nuclear power plants is low and declining. The consequences of an accident or terrorist attack are minimal compared with other commonly accepted risks.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-a-nuclear-power-plant>What are the pros and cons of a nuclear power plant?</h2>
<p>Pros and cons of nuclear power</p>
<table><tr><th>Pros of nuclear</th><th>Cons of nuclear</th></tr><tr><td>Carbon-free electricity</td><td>Uranium is technically non-renewable</td></tr><tr><td>Small land footprint</td><td>Very high upfront costs</td></tr><tr><td>Reliable baseload electricity source</td><td>Nuclear waste</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-was-a-nuclear-power-plant-built-in-the-philippines>Why was a nuclear power plant built in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Nuclear power was considered as a solution to the 1973 oil crisis, in which the Philippines was affected. The Bataan Nuclear Power Plant was built in the early 1980s but never went into operation because it sits on a tectonic fault and volcano. The Fukushima nuclear disaster gave pause to efforts to revive the plant.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-use-nuclear-power-in-the-philippines>Is it safe to use nuclear power in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>When discussing the viability of nuclear power in the Philippines, it is less a question of “is nuclear power safe for the Philippines,” and more of “is nuclear power safe in the hands of Filipinos?” You must be logged in to post a comment.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-bataan-nuclear-power-plant-still-in-use>Is the Bataan nuclear power plant still in use?</h2>
<p>Despite never having been commissioned, the plant has remained intact, including the nuclear reactor, and has continued to be maintained. The Philippine government completed paying off its obligations on the plant in April 2007, more than 30 years after construction began.</p>

<p>Finally, nuclear fuel, like all fuel, leaves by-products. This is normally contained in the plant and can be reprocessed and recycled. However, a few risks remain. While nuclear power plants are normally safe environments, Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 prove accidents happen.</p>
