<h2 id=what-was-the-importance-of-baltimore-in-the-civil-war>What was the importance of Baltimore in the Civil War?</h2>
<p>Fact #8: Baltimore was a vital base for the Union Navy’s activities in the Chesapeake Bay. After the Union naval base at Norfolk, Virginia, was captured by the South in 1861, Baltimore became a vital base for naval activities in the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-importance-of-1861-to-1865>What was the importance of 1861 to 1865?</h2>
<p>The American Civil War (April 12, 1861 – May 9, 1865, also known by other names) was a civil war in the United States fought between northern and Pacific states (“the Union” or “the North”) and southern states that voted to secede and form the Confederate States of America (“the Confederacy” or “the South”).</p>
<h2 id=what-made-maryland-so-important-in-the-civil-war>What made Maryland so important in the Civil War?</h2>
<p>Troops marching through Frederick, Maryland. This is the only known photo of Confederate troops on the march. Maryland’s location south of the Mason-Dixon line and its proximity to the nation’s capitol made it a lynchpin to the Union during the Civil War.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-in-maryland-during-the-civil-war>What happened in Maryland during the Civil War?</h2>
<p>During the American Civil War, Maryland was a border state. Maryland was a slave state, but it never seceded from the Union. Throughout the course of the war, some 80,000 Marylanders served in Union armies, about 10% of those in the USCT.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-maryland-fight-for-in-the-civil-war>Who did Maryland fight for in the Civil war?</h2>
<p>Although it was a slaveholding state, Maryland did not secede. The majority of the population living north and west of Baltimore held loyalties to the Union, while most citizens living on larger farms in the southern and eastern areas of the state were sympathetic to the Confederacy.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-maryland-located-during-the-civil-war>Where was Maryland located during the Civil War?</h2>
<p>During the American Civil War (1861-1865), Maryland, a slave state, was one of the border states, straddling the South and North.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-mayor-of-baltimore-in-1861>Who was the mayor of Baltimore in 1861?</h2>
<p>On the afternoon of April 18, 1861, Baltimore Mayor George W. Brown dispatched a strong letter of warning to Abraham Lincoln. “The people are exasperated to the highest degree by the passage of troops,” Brown wrote, “and the citizens are universally decided in the opinion that no more should be ordered to come.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-a-riot-in-baltimore-in-1861>Why was there a riot in Baltimore in 1861?</h2>
<p>The authorities…did their best to day [sic] to protect both strangers and citizens and to prevent a collision, but [in] vain….it is my solemn duty to inform you that it is not possible for more soldiers to pass through Baltimore unless they fight their way at every step.”</p>
<h2 id=why-was-maryland-arrested-during-the-civil-war>Why was Maryland arrested during the Civil War?</h2>
<p>On September 17, 1861, the first day of the Maryland legislature’s new session, fully one third of the members of the Maryland General Assembly were arrested, due to federal concerns that the Assembly “would aid the anticipated rebel invasion and would attempt to take the state out of the Union.”.</p>
