<h2 id=why-is-deforestation-is-responsible-for-less-rain>Why is deforestation is responsible for less rain?</h2>
<p>Deforestation leads to reduced rainfall because it reduces the natural recycling of moisture from the soils. This recycling takes place through vegetation and returns to the form of rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-deforestation-affect-rainfall>How does deforestation affect rainfall?</h2>
<p>Trees evaporate water to form clouds. As a result deforestation leads to the less water absorbed from the soil affecting the water cycle and formation of clouds becomes difficult leading to reduced rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=does-rainfall-reduce-deforestation>Does rainfall reduce deforestation?</h2>
<p>Deforestation means cutting down of trees or forests. We know that trees transpire and play an important role in the water cycle as it adds moisture to the air which brings rainfall. So if the number of trees decreases the process of transpiration and water cycle will be disturbed hence the rainfall will be reduced.</p>
<h2 id=does-deforestation-increase-rain>Does deforestation increase rain?</h2>
<p>Deforestation causes increases in temperatures and changes in the amount and distribution of rainfall —generally creating a drier climate. These impacts can affect soil moisture, reducing yields in some areas and increasing flooding in others.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-deforestation-lead-to-global-warming>How does deforestation lead to global warming?</h2>
<p>Tropical forest trees, like all green plants, take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen during photosynthesis. When trees are cut down and burned or allowed to rot, their stored carbon is released into the air as carbon dioxide. And this is how deforestation and forest degradation contribute to global warming.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-come-from-deforestation>What percentage of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation?</h2>
<p>Tropical deforestation contributes about 20% of annual global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and reducing it will be necessary to avoid dangerous climate change.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-trees-are-cut-down>What happens when trees are cut down?</h2>
<p>When forests are cut down, not only does carbon absorption cease, but also the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere as CO2 if the wood is burned or even if it is left to rot after the deforestation process. Deforestation is an important factor in global climate change.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-deforestation-reduce-the-amount-of-rainfall>Why does deforestation reduce the amount of rainfall?</h2>
<p>This drop occurs because deforestation reduces the natural recycling of moisture from soils, through vegetation, and into the atmosphere, from where it returns as rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-link-between-deforestation-and-flooding>Is there a link between deforestation and flooding?</h2>
<p>In summary then, it is understandable to associate deforestation with flooding. In the absence of trees, interception of rainfall, as well as uptake of groundwater, is dramatically reduced. Alongside the more obvious parallels between deforestation and flooding, are the more indirect effects also.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-companies-make-an-impact-on-deforestation>How can companies make an impact on deforestation?</h2>
<p>Companies can make an impact by introducing and implementing “zero deforestation” policies that clean up their supply chains. That means holding their suppliers accountable for producing commodities like timber, beef, soy, palm oil and paper in a way that does not fuel deforestation and has a minimal impact on our climate.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-to-stop-deforestation-in-africa>Why do we need to stop deforestation in Africa?</h2>
<p>“We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink. “Deforestation has been massively reduced in the Amazon, but that hasn’t happened elsewhere. As countries get more peaceful in Africa we could lose more tropical forests, which really worries me.”</p>
