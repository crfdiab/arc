<p>1826<br>
Centuries of advances in chemistry and optics, including the invention of the camera obscura, set the stage for the world’s first photograph. In 1826, French scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, took that photograph, titled View from the Window at Le Gras, at his family’s country home.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-first-photo-taken>How was the first photo taken?</h2>
<p>The photo, taken by French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826 or 1827, captures the view outside his window in Burgundy. He snapped the shot with a camera obscura by focusing it onto a pewter plate, with the whole process taking him about eight hours.</p>

<p>Joseph Nicéphore Niépce<br>
The world’s oldest surviving photograph is, well, difficult to see. The grayish-hued plate containing hardened bitumen looks like a blur. In 1826, an inventor named Joseph Nicéphore Niépce took the photo, which shows the view outside of “Le Gras,” Niépce’s estate in Saint-Loup-de-Varennes, France.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-photos-came-from>Where did the photos came from?</h2>
<p>Photography, as we know it today, began in the late 1830s in France. Joseph Nicéphore Niépce used a portable camera obscura to expose a pewter plate coated with bitumen to light. This is the first recorded image that did not fade quickly.</p>

<p>Not many know Charles O’Rear is the man behind Bliss, the photograph considered by many as the most-viewed picture in the history of the world. O’Rear clicked Bliss 21 years ago and it was used by Microsoft as the default background for its Windows XP operating system.</p>

<p>20 of the Most Famous Photographs in History</p>

<li>#1 Henri Cartier-Bresson’s famous photo Man Jumping the Puddle | 1930.</li>
<li>#2 The famous photo The Steerage by Alfred Stieglitz | 1907.</li>
<li>#3 Stanley Forman’s famous photo Woman Falling From Fire Escape |1975.</li>
<li>#4 Kevin Carter’s controversial photo – Starving Child and Vulture | 1993.</li>

<h2 id=who-invented-photos>Who invented photos?</h2>
<p>However, it wasn’t until the 19th century that a breakthrough occurred. The world’s earliest successful photograph was taken by French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826. As such, Niépce is considered the world’s first photographer and the true inventor of photography as we know it today.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-first-photographs-called>What were the first photographs called?</h2>
<p>heliography<br>
He “developed” this picture by washing away the unhardened bitumen with lavender water, revealing an image of the rooftops and trees visible from his studio window. And thus the first known photograph was born. Niépce himself called it heliography, or “light writing.”</p>

<p>This photo, simply titled, “View from the Window at Le Gras,” is said to be the world’s earliest surviving photograph. And it was almost lost forever. Harry Ransom Center/University of Texas It was taken by Nicéphore Niépce in a commune in France called Saint-Loup-de-Varennes somewhere between 1826 and 1827.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-photograph-of-the-sun-taken>Where was the first photograph of the Sun taken?</h2>
<p>Just five years after the first photo of the moon, in 1845, French physicists Louis Fizeau and Leon Foucault took the first photograph of the sun. Even with just a 1/60th exposure, it’s possible to see sunspots. It only seems fitting that the first known photograph of a tornado was taken in Kansas.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-color-photograph-come-out>When did the first color photograph come out?</h2>
<p>The color photograph dates back to 1848, when the French physicist Edmond Becquerel first created it at the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris. Becquerel’s method in producing the photograph was more empirical than artistic in nature, decidedly unpopular, and, as the French National Centre for Scientific Research puts it, “quickly abandoned.”</p>

<p>Captured using a technique known as heliography, the shot was taken from an upstairs window at Niépce’s estate in Burgundy. As heliography produces one-of-a-kind images, there are no duplicates of the piece, which is now part of the permanent collection at the University of Texas-Austin.</p>
