<h2 id=can-you-camp-anywhere-you-want-in-colorado>Can you camp anywhere you want in Colorado?</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, camping in national forests is free, anywhere in the country. Wilderness areas in Colorado—like Mount Zirkel, Mount Evans, or Weminuche—also often have great free camping, but remember that these spaces have more regulations than National Forest or BLM land.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-camp-in-colorado-without-a-reservation>Where can I camp in Colorado without a reservation?</h2>
<p>6 Glorious Campgrounds Around Denver Where No Reservation Is Required</p>
<ul>
<li>1.) Platte River Campground (Deckers) Google Maps.</li>
<li>2.) The Crags Campground (Divide) Yelp/O K.</li>
<li>3.) Deer Creek Campground (Bailey)</li>
<li>4.) Elbert Creek Campground (Leadville)</li>
<li>5.) Flat Rocks Campground (Sedalia)</li>
<li>6.) Springdale Campground (Woodland Park)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-permit-to-camp-in-colorado>Do you need a permit to camp in Colorado?</h2>
<p>Depending on location, you may be required to purchase a pass or permit. Plan ahead by reviewing the websites listed above and the information posted at campground entrances. Be aware of your location and obey all posted signs and notices at campgrounds and trail entrances.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-camp-anywhere-you-want>Can you camp anywhere you want?</h2>
<p>The logical answer is that yes, technically, you can camp anywhere if you have permission. But campers needn’t limit themselves to improved campgrounds. Dispersed campsites scattered across public lands provide an isolated place to pitch a tent.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-sleep-in-your-car-in-denver>Is it legal to sleep in your car in Denver?</h2>
<p>In Denver, it’s technically legal to sleep in your vehicle, but people can end up in trouble if they violate other parking laws or stay in one spot too long. Even in places where there’s no ban on sleeping in cars, people living in them are often visited by police, sometimes late at night.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-camp-for-free-in-colorado>Can you camp for free in Colorado?</h2>
<p>Free camping is easy to come by, as long as you know where to look. National forests hold most of the free camping in Colorado, followed up by BLM land (Bureau of Land Management). Camping for free is generally referred to as dispersed camping, which is camping in approved areas other than campgrounds.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-rules-for-camping-in-colorado>What are the rules for camping in Colorado?</h2>
<p>Rules and Guidelines for Dispersed Camping Dispersed campers can only stay in a single spot for 14 days in a 30-day period. Generally, campers must move at least three miles from the original campsite before setting up camp again. After two 14-day periods of camping, campers must leave the national forest or grassland.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-live-in-a-tent-in-the-woods>Can you live in a tent in the woods?</h2>
<p>Is it even legal or illegal to live out in the woods in a tent? So, yes! It is completely legal to live in a tent in the woods, provided that you know how to do it safely and legally, within the guidelines set up by the federal or state government (depending on what land you end up staying on).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-boondocking>What is the meaning of Boondocking?</h2>
<p>Boondocking is a term used by RVers to describe RVing without being connected to water, electric, or sewer. Because you’re not connected to any services it’s also called dry camping.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-sleep-in-your-car-in-a-walmart-parking-lot>Can you sleep in your car in a Walmart parking lot?</h2>
<p>Generally, yes, you can sleep in your car at Walmart. Walmart does not have a corporate-wide policy of allowing people to sleep in their car in their parking lots. It’s up to each store manager to decide. Most Walmart store managers tend to not issue a policy on the matter, preferring not to do anything about it.</p>
<h2 id=what-states-is-it-illegal-to-sleep-in-your-car>What states is it illegal to sleep in your car?</h2>
<p>Sleeping in your car laws by state</p>
<table><tr><th>State</th><th>Overnight parking at rest stops</th></tr><tr><td>Alaska</td><td>Nothing specified</td></tr><tr><td>Arizona</td><td>Allowed, but no camping outside the car</td></tr><tr><td>Arkansas</td><td>Allowed for safety purposes only, no camping</td></tr><tr><td>California</td><td>8-hour limit at rest stops, no overnight parking or camping</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=are-there-any-dispersed-camping-sites-in-colorado>Are there any dispersed camping sites in Colorado?</h2>
<p>If you’re unaware, dispersed camping is completely free and sites are spread throughout Colorado. Basically, they are just primitive locations for people to pitch a tent. A fire ring frequently exists but thankfully, crowds rarely do.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-best-places-to-camp-in-colorado>Where are the best places to camp in Colorado?</h2>
<p>Campers can hike Vasquez Peak or explore the Continental Divide Trail. Or, if hiking isn’t your thing and you have a sturdy car, drive the road a bit and catch the views above treeline. Freaking spectacular! To get there: Take I-70 west to the US-40 exit towards Winter Park. Drive on 40 for roughly 8-10 miles.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-most-swimmable-lakes-in-colorado>Where are the most swimmable lakes in Colorado?</h2>
<p>Activities such as fishing, boating, windsurfing, waterskiing, and hiking, camping, and horseback riding. Blue Mesa Reservoir is located at 102 Elk Creek, CO 81230. Boulder Reservoir. Photo Credit: © Salty Chip</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-places-in-montana-where-you-can-camp>Are there any Places in Montana where you can camp?</h2>
<p>And there are local and regional stores that allow camping as well (A1 Superfoods grocery store in Montana is a prime example). The camping situation is pretty similar to camping at a Walmart – you’re basically in a parking lot so it’s not the greatest, but sometimes it’s necessary.</p>
