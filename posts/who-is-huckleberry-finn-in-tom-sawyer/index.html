<h2 id=who-is-huckleberry-finn-in-tom-sawyer>Who is Huckleberry Finn in Tom Sawyer?</h2>
<p>Huckleberry “Huck” Finn is a fictional character created by Mark Twain who first appeared in the book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and is the protagonist and narrator of its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-huckleberry-finn-so-important>Why is Huckleberry Finn so important?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has proved significant not only as a novel that explores the racial and moral world of its time but also, through the controversies that continue to surround it, as an artifact of those same moral and racial tensions as they have evolved to the present day.</p>
<h2 id=is-huck-finn-a-good-or-bad-person>Is Huck Finn a good or bad person?</h2>
<p>Huck may prank Jim, and may make fun of his superstition, but in the end he does the right thing. The fact that a boy growing up in the pre-Civil War South is able to think of a black slave as his friend shows that Huck, more than anyone else in the story, is a good friend—and a good person.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-adventure-of-huckleberry-finn-all-about>What is Adventure of Huckleberry Finn all about?</h2>
<p>On its surface, Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a straightforward story about a boy and a runaway slave floating down the Mississippi River. But underneath, the book—which was published in the U.S. on February 18, 1885—is a subversive confrontation of slavery and racism.</p>
<h2 id=is-tom-sawyer-a-true-story>Is Tom Sawyer a true story?</h2>
<p>Twain named his fictional character after a San Francisco fireman whom he met in June 1863. The real Tom Sawyer was a local hero, famous for rescuing 90 passengers after a shipwreck.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-huckleberry-finn-teach-us>What does Huckleberry Finn teach us?</h2>
<p>What is the lesson of Huckleberry Finn? Huck learns a variety of life lessons on the river that contribute to the growth of his character. He learns how to live away from society’s demands and rules, but also learns the value of friendship, and values used to make decisions on what his heart tells him to do.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-moral-lesson-of-huckleberry-finn>What is the moral lesson of Huckleberry Finn?</h2>
<p>Huck learns a variety of life lessons on the Mississippi River that contribute to the growth of his character. He not only learns how to live away from society’s demands and rules, but he also learns the values of friendship; values he uses to make decisions based on what his heart tells him.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-huck-a-hero>Why is Huck a hero?</h2>
<p>Throughout this book, Huck demonstrates the epitome of heroism, for the attitude that he posses, as well as his actions and willingness to change. Huck can be called a hero for a great number or reasons throughout the book. In every chapter we notice little things that point in the favor of Huck being one.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-huck-consider-to-be-the-big-clear-river>What did Huck consider to be the big clear river?</h2>
<p>The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn’t talk back and aggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn’t have no more trouble.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-message-of-huckleberry-finn>What is the message of Huckleberry Finn?</h2>
<p>What Huck and Jim seek is freedom, and this freedom is sharply contrasted with the existing civilization along the great river. This conflict between freedom and orderly civilization forms the overarching theme of the novel.</p>
