<h2 id=how-much-time-do-you-need-in-death-valley>How much time do you need in Death Valley?</h2>
<p>Three days in the park allows you time to see most of its major sights—from Furnace Creek down to Badwater, out to Zabriskie Point and Dante’s View, up to Scotty’s Castle and Ubehebe Crater, and out to the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes and Stovepipe Wells—with a fair amount of time to see other sights along the way and take …</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-death-valley-from-los-angeles>How long does it take to get to Death Valley from Los Angeles?</h2>
<p>It’s nearly a 4-hour drive from Los Angeles to Death Valley, and about a 2-hour drive from Las Vegas.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-get-to-death-valley-by-car>How do you get to Death Valley by car?</h2>
<p>The most popular drive in Death Valley is the Badwater Road. If you visit the Devils Golf Course, Badwater, and take Artists Drive on the return trip back to Highway 190 it should take about 1½ hours round-trip.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-time-to-go-to-death-valley>What is the best time to go to Death Valley?</h2>
<p>The hottest, driest and lowest national park, Death Valley is well-known for its blistering summer temperatures. For that reason, the best time of year to visit is what’s considered the offseason in most other parks: mid-October to mid-May.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-miles-from-los-angeles-to-death-valley>How many miles from Los Angeles to Death Valley?</h2>
<p>There is a distance of 200 miles between Death Valley and Los Angeles. If you are coming from this city, check the best things to do in LA and where to stay in Los Angeles. Death Valley and Sequoia National Park are only 3 hours away from each other. We will also access through the west entrance.</p>

<p>In total, it takes 7 and a half hours to travel the distance between Death Valley and San Francisco (460 miles). As this is quite a long trip, I recommend stopping halfway and go to Death Valley from Bakersfield the next day.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-drive-from-death-valley-to-yosemite>How long is the drive from Death Valley to Yosemite?</h2>
<p>It is a 4.5 hours drive between Death Valley and Yosemite, and you will enter through the west entrance of Panamint Springs. It takes 4 hours to get to Death Valley from Los Angeles through the west entrance. There is a distance of 200 miles between Death Valley and Los Angeles.</p>
