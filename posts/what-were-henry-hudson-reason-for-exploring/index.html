<h2 id=what-were-henry-hudson-reason-for-exploring>What were Henry Hudson reason for exploring?</h2>
<p>Henry Hudson made his first voyage west from England in 1607, when he was hired to find a shorter route to Asia from Europe through the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-reason-for-the-voyage-of-henry-hudson-quizlet>What was the reason for the voyage of Henry Hudson quizlet?</h2>
<p>What was the first country that Henry Hudson sailed for? What was Hudson’s purpose when sailing for England? He wanted to find a northward passage from Europe to China.</p>
<h2 id=why-would-his-claims-for-the-dutch-be-discouragement-to-hudson>Why would his claims for the Dutch be discouragement to Hudson?</h2>
<p>He wanted to claim the land for the English. He did not find the water route to Asia. He wanted more territory to the south.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-henry-hudsons-voyages-benefit-europe>How did Henry Hudson’s voyages benefit Europe?</h2>
<p>Hudson’s discovery of the Hudson Bay in Canada also helped spark Europeans’ increased interests in colonization in North America. Not only did Hudson’s discovery lead to an increased interest in European colonization, but they also led to an increased interest in trade with Native Americans.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-henry-hudson-discover-on-his-voyages>What did Henry Hudson discover on his voyages?</h2>
<p>His first two voyages were through Arctic waters and proved to be unsuccessful due to ice. His third and fourth voyages were to North America where he discovered and sailed the Hudson River, Hudson Strait, and Hudson Bay. Henry Hudson’s discoveries influenced other explorers and laid the foundation for future colonization and trading.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-henry-hudson-want-to-go-to-asia>Why did Henry Hudson want to go to Asia?</h2>
<p>In 1609, Hudson was chosen by merchants of the Dutch East India Company in the Netherlands to find an easterly passage to Asia. While awaiting orders and supplies in Amsterdam, he heard rumours of a northwest route to the Pacific through North America.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-henry-hudson-contribute-to-the-colonization-of-canada>How did Henry Hudson contribute to the colonization of Canada?</h2>
<p>Hudson’s discoveries laid the groundwork for Dutch colonization of the Hudson River region, as well as English land claims in Canada. Though little is known about Hudson’s early life, it seems he studied navigation and earned widespread renown for his skills, as well as his knowledge of Arctic geography.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-henry-hudson-go-in-search-of-the-northwest-passage>Where did Henry Hudson go in search of the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>Not far above Russia, Hudson and his men were once again blocked by heavy ice packs. Hudson chose to ignore his orders from the Dutch, and instead headed in search for the Northwest passage. He crossed the Atlantic Ocean, made his way down Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in Canada.</p>
