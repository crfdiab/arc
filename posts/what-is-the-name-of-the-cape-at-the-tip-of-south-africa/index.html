<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-cape-at-the-tip-of-south-africa>What is the name of the Cape at the tip of South Africa?</h2>
<p>The Cape of Good Hope<br>
The Cape of Good Hope is located at the southern tip of the Cape Peninsula, which is also home to Cape Town, the legislative capital of South Africa. The Cape was originally named the Cape of Storms in the 1480s by the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-known-as-the-cape-of-good-hope>What is known as the Cape of Good Hope?</h2>
<p>The Cape of Good Hope is a headland on the Atlantic coast side of South Africa. It was later renamed, by King John II of Portugal, the Cape of Good Hope because of the great optimism engendered by the opening of a sea route to India and the East.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-cape-of-good-hope-route>What is Cape of Good Hope route?</h2>
<p>The Cape of Good Hope route joins Eastern Asia and Europe to southern parts of Africa. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 provided a much shorter route from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean, making the long trip around Africa inefficient.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-busiest-sea-route-in-the-world>Which is the busiest sea route in the world?</h2>
<p>The English Channel<br>
The English Channel (between the UK and France) The busiest sea route in the world, it connects the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. More than 500 ships pass through this channel daily.</p>
<h2 id=is-cape-of-good-hope-worth-visiting>Is Cape of Good Hope worth visiting?</h2>
<p>We loved the wildness and the floral and fauna on the way down to the Cape. The scenery is worth the visit but the crowds – especially those folks who insist on taking a photo with every camera in their group and of each person AND the group – are just a bit boorish.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-cape-of-good-hope-happen>When did the Cape of Good Hope happen?</h2>
<p>On July 8th, year 1497 the expedition made a grand exit out of the Port of Lisbon and by November of the same year sailed around the Cape of Storms, or to be precise, the Cape of Good Hope. Needless to say that the storms continuing for days and days made it very difficult and caused a damage beyond repair to one of the vessels…</p>
<h2 id=is-the-cape-of-good-hope-the-southernmost-point-of-africa>Is the Cape of Good Hope the southernmost point of Africa?</h2>
<p>This misconception was based on the misbelief that the Cape was the dividing point between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Contemporary geographic knowledge instead states the southernmost point of Africa is Cape Agulhas about 150 kilometres (90 mi) to the east-southeast.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-vegetation-is-at-cape-of-good-hope>What kind of vegetation is at Cape of Good Hope?</h2>
<p>The Cape of Good Hope section of the park is generally wild, unspoiled and undeveloped and is an important haven for seabirds. The vegetation at Cape Point consists primarily of Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos .</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-birds-live-on-the-cape-of-good-hope>What kind of birds live on the Cape of Good Hope?</h2>
<p>With its diverse habitat, ranging from rocky mountain tops to beaches and open sea, the Cape of Good Hope is home to at least 250 species of birds including one of the two mainland colonies of African penguins.</p>
