<h2 id=what-did-fort-whoop-up-trade>What did Fort Whoop-Up trade?</h2>
<p>Fort Whoop-Up was the nickname (eventually adopted as the official name) given to a whisky trading post, originally Fort Hamilton, near what is now Lethbridge, Alberta….</p>
<table><tr><th>Fort Whoop-Up</th></tr><tr><td>Built</td><td>1870</td></tr><tr><td>Original use</td><td>Fur and Whisky Trading</td></tr><tr><td>Demolished</td><td>1915</td></tr><tr><td>Rebuilt</td><td>1967</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-fort-whoop-up>What happened to Fort Whoop-Up?</h2>
<p>Hamilton left Fort Whoop-Up in 1873, though Healy stayed on for three more years. Near the end of their trek west, the NWMP hired a respected guide named Jerry Potts who led them to Fort Whoop-Up on October 9, 1874. But instead of a rowdy whisky trade, they found the fort nearly abandoned, with no whisky in sight.</p>
<h2 id=what-remains-of-fort-whoop-up>What remains of Fort Whoop-Up?</h2>
<p>whisky fort<br>
The Fort Whoop-Up Archaeological Site is represented by the remains of an early historic ‘whisky fort’, located six kilometres southwest of Lethbridge on a low north facing terrace of the Oldman River, 2.4 kilometres west of its confluence with the St. Mary River.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-whiskey-trade>What was the whiskey trade?</h2>
<p>When the white man introduced whiskey to the plains native in the mid-1800s, it had a sudden, devastating effect on a deep-rooted way of life. At first, fur traders came to the Northwest Territory bringing guns, blankets and cooking utensils to trade for buffalo robes. Soon whiskey became the trade item of choice.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-fort-whoop-up-called-fort-whoop-up>Why is Fort Whoop-Up called Fort Whoop-Up?</h2>
<p>The sale of whiskey and firearms from Fort Hamilton led to disorder among the First Nations in the area, and the fort was renamed Fort Whoop-Up in recognition of its reputation as one of the more dangerous and lawless forts in the northwest.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-whoop-up-mean>What does whoop-up mean?</h2>
<p>informal. to enjoy yourself in a noisy and excited way. Taking pleasure in something. bask.</p>
<h2 id=who-won-the-battle-of-belly-river>Who won the battle of Belly River?</h2>
<p>Blackfoot victory<br>
Treaty No. 7, between the Blackfoot Confederacy and the Crown, was signed in 1877. In 1906, the town of Lethbridge was founded near the battle site….</p>
<table><tr><th>Battle of the Belly River</th></tr><tr><td>Date October 25, 1870 Location Present day Lethbridge, Alberta Result Decisive Blackfoot victory</td></tr><tr><td>Belligerents</td></tr><tr><td>Blackfoot Confederacy</td><td>Cree</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-was-the-great-march-west>What was the great march west?</h2>
<p>The March West was the initial journey of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) to the Canadian prairies, made between July 8 and October 9, 1874. It was the result of the force being deployed to what is now southern Alberta in response to the Cypress Hills Massacre and subsequent fears of a US military intervention.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-traders-at-fort-whoop-up-trade>What did the traders at Fort Whoop-Up trade?</h2>
<p>Traders, like Healy and Hamilton, brought their stockpile of whisky to Canada to continue their lucrative trade. While whisky was a foundational trading item at Fort Whoop-Up and other trading posts, there was much legal trading that occurred, such as trading blankets, food, firearms, or ammunition for buffalo robes.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-fort-whoop-up-whisky-trading-post-located>Where was Fort Whoop-Up whisky trading post located?</h2>
<p>Location of Fort Whoop-Up in Alberta. Fort Whoop-Up was the nickname (eventually adopted as the official name) given to a whisky trading post, originally Fort Hamilton, near what is now Lethbridge, Alberta.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-fort-whoop-post-so-important>Why was the Fort Whoop post so important?</h2>
<p>During the late 19th century, the post served as a centre for trading activities, including the illegal whisky trade. The sale of whisky was outlawed but, due to the lack of law enforcement in the region prior to 1874, many whisky traders had settled in the area and taken to charging unusually high prices for their goods.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-did-it-cost-to-build-fort-whoop-up>How much did it cost to build Fort Whoop Up?</h2>
<p>Healy and Hamilton contracted James Gladstone and a crew of 30 workers to construct a second, more secure fort, which was later nicknamed Fort Whoop-Up. It took two years to build at a cost of $25,000.</p>
