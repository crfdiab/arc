<h2 id=why-did-raffles-want-to-bring-tengku-hussein-to-singapore-for-a-discussion>Why did Raffles want to bring Tengku Hussein to Singapore for a discussion?</h2>
<p>To prevent the Dutch from challenging the legality of this treaty, Raffles wanted the endorsement of the Malay sovereign. As Tengku Hussein had not been installed as Sultan, Raffles summoned Hussein to Singapore and proclaimed him as the ruler of Johore on 6 February 1819, with the full support of the Temenggong.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-sir-stamford-raffles-known-for>What is Sir Stamford Raffles known for?</h2>
<p>Born July 6, 1781, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles is best known for his career in the East India Company, during which he played a central role in the British conquest and administration of Java, founded Singapore, devoted himself to ethnography and natural history, and published a seminal History of Java.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-stamford-raffles-first-land-in-singapore>When did Stamford Raffles first land in Singapore?</h2>
<p>This date is recognised as the official founding of Singapore.12 Controversy has arisen, however, from Raffles’s mistake in recording the date of his first landing as 29 February 1819, in his “Statement of the Services of Sir Stamford Raffles” – a date that does not exist because 1819 was not a leap year.13</p>
<h2 id=what-did-stamford-raffles-do-in-the-napoleonic-wars>What did Stamford Raffles do in the Napoleonic Wars?</h2>
<p>Raffles was heavily involved in the capture of the Indonesian island of Java from the Dutch during the Napoleonic Wars, and the running of day-to-day operations on Singapore. He also wrote The History of Java (1817).</p>
<h2 id=who-was-sir-thomas-raffles-and-what-did-he-do>Who was Sir Thomas Raffles and what did he do?</h2>
<p>Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles (1781-1826) was an English colonial administrator, historian, and founder of Singapore. A man of vision, industry, and feeling, he made incalculable contributions to the knowledge of the Malay Archipelago and to the British overseas empire.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-sir-thomas-stamford-raffles-die>How did Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles die?</h2>
<p>On July 5, 1826, less than 3 months after receiving the court’s letter demanding repayment, Raffles died of an apoplectic stroke. In his short span of life Raffles had suffered numerous crushing blows which would have felled a lesser man.</p>
