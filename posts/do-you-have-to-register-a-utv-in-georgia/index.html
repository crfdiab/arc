<h2 id=do-you-have-to-have-a-tag-on-a-trailer-in-georgia>Do you have to have a tag on a trailer in Georgia?</h2>

<h2 id=does-georgia-title-side-by-sides>Does Georgia title side by sides?</h2>
<p>Yeah, Georgia doesn’t require titles for ATVs, they’re probably thinking about MSOs. A bill of sale is all you need. A nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-ride-a-dirtbike-on-the-road-in-georgia>Is it illegal to ride a dirtbike on the road in Georgia?</h2>

<p>Quick Definitions. An ATV (all-terrain vehicle) is also known as “quad” or “four wheeler” and is meant for single-riders. A UTV (utility task vehicle) tends to be beefier and allows for “side-by-side” riding, which is why some simply call it a “side by side” or “SXS” for short.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-you-have-to-get-a-trailer-tag-in-ga>How long do you have to get a trailer tag in GA?</h2>
<p>Tips. You have 30 days from the date of purchase, or the date you bring the trailer into the state, to register your trailer and put on Georgia plates, whether you’ve just moved to Georgia or you are already a Georgia resident.</p>
