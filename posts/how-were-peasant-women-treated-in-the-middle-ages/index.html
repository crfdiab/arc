<h2 id=how-were-peasant-women-treated-in-the-middle-ages>How were peasant women treated in the Middle Ages?</h2>
<p>Medieval peasant women had to provide meals and undertake menial tasks for their lord and his family. Many of the Medieval peasants who worked in the castles were women. Medieval Peasant Women worked in the kitchen and were expected to cook, clean and wait on the lord.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-a-lady-in-medieval-times>What was the role of a lady in medieval times?</h2>
<p>Women held the positions of wife, mother, peasant, artisan, and nun, as well as some important leadership roles, such as abbess or queen regnant. The very concept of “woman” changed in a number of ways during the Middle Ages and several forces influenced women’s roles during their period.</p>

<p>medieval singlewoman<br>
A medieval singlewoman (also unmarried, unwed, spinster, husbandless, maiden) is a woman born between the 5th and 15th century (c. 400 AD – 1500) who did not marry.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-unmarried-woman-called>What is unmarried woman called?</h2>
<p>Historically, “Miss” has been the formal title for an unmarried woman. “Mrs.,” on the other hand, refers to a married woman. “Ms.” is a little trickier: It’s used by and for both unmarried and married women.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-women-in-medieval-england>What was life like for women in medieval England?</h2>
<p>The History Learning Site, . . Medieval England was not a comfortable place for most women. Medieval women invariably had a hard time in an era when many men lived harsh lives. A few women lived comfortable lives but Medieval society was completely dominated by men and women had to know ‘their place’ in such a society.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-judicial-system-treat-women-in-medieval-times>How did the judicial system treat women in medieval times?</h2>
<p>In some cases, the judicial system in the High Medieval Ages treated female offenders more leniently. For example, same-sex relationships, which carried the death penalty for men, were no crime at all for women because such a relationship did not affect human reproduction. Women who were found guilty of a capital offense were not so lucky though.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-men-and-women-get-paid-in-medieval-times>What did men and women get paid in medieval times?</h2>
<p>There are some documents that still survive today stating what many common village tasks entailed and how much the job should be worth in terms of pay to both men and women. For example, a man may have received eight pence per day for reaping while women would receive just five.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-women-in-medieval-times-get-married>How did women in medieval times get married?</h2>
<p>While poor women would not marry until they were in their twenties – instead required to work for their family – many women born into wealthy families would marry while still teenagers. This was not uncommon – unlike in modern society, medieval children were worked and treated as adults from as young as 10 or 11.</p>
