<p>And viewers will enjoy that “Turn” is fairly faithful to the history of the Culper Ring. Woodhull is accurately shown as a conflicted man who nevertheless follows a strong moral compass.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-the-governor-of-new-york-in-1664>Who was the Governor of New York in 1664?</h2>
<p>In 1664, English ships entered Gravesend Bay in modern Brooklyn, and troops marched to capture the ferry across the East River to the city, with minimal resistance: the governor at the time, Peter Stuyvesant, was unpopular with the residents of the city.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-new-york-city-change-its-date-to-1664>When did New York City change its date to 1664?</h2>
<p>The date of 1664 appeared on New York City’s corporate seal until 1975, when the date was changed to 1625 to reflect the year of Dutch incorporation as a city and to incidentally allow New York to celebrate its 350th anniversary just 11 years after its 300th.</p>
