<p>After turning east, they sighted “Newland”—i.e Spitsbergen—on the 27 May, near the mouth of the great bay Hudson later simply named the “Great Indraught” (Isfjorden). On 13 July, Hudson and his crew estimated that they had sailed as far north as 80° 23′ N, but more likely only reached 79° 23′ N.</p>

<p>What was Henry Hudson famous for? Henry Hudson was an English navigator and explorer who set out to find either a northeast passage “by the North Pole to Japan and China” or a similar northwest passage.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-henry-hudson-do-before-going-to-north-america>What did Henry Hudson do before going to North America?</h2>
<p>Early Life. Considered one of the world’s most famous explorers, Henry Hudson, born in England circa 1565, never actually found what he was looking for. Prior to 1607, Hudson probably worked aboard other ships before being appointed to lead one on his own.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-henry-hudson-come-to-north-america>When did Henry Hudson come to North America?</h2>
<p>In 1609, he landed in North America on behalf of the Dutch East India Company and explored the region around the modern New York metropolitan area.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-henry-hudson-try-to-find-the-northeast-passage>Where did Henry Hudson try to find the Northeast Passage?</h2>
<p>Records indicate that he was married and had three sons. In 1607 and 1608, Hudson made two attempts on behalf of English merchants to find a rumored Northeast Passage to Cathay (present-day China) via a route above the Arctic Circle.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-henry-hudson-get-his-third-expedition>How did Henry Hudson get his third expedition?</h2>
<p>Though English companies were reluctant to back him after two failed voyages, Hudson was able to gain a commission from the Dutch East India Company to lead a third expedition in 1609. While in Amsterdam gathering supplies, Hudson heard reports of two possible channels running across North America to the Pacific.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-latitude-of-henry-hudsons-ship>What was the latitude of Henry Hudson’s ship?</h2>
<p>One was located around latitude 62° N (based on English explorer Captain George Weymouth’s 1602 voyage); the second, around latitude 40° N, had been recently reported by Captain John Smith.</p>
