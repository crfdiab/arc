The current President, Muhammadu Buhari took office on May 29, 2015 as the 15th President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-president-to-take-office-in-nigeria>Who was the first president to take office in Nigeria?</h2>
<p>The first President of Nigeria was Nnamdi Azikiwe, who took office on October 1, 1963. The current President, Muhammadu Buhari took office on May 29, 2015 as the 15th President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-executive-power-go-in-the-nigerian-constitution>Where does executive power go in the Nigerian Constitution?</h2>
<p>In practical terms, the 1999 Constitution follows the US Constitution in separating the executive power from the legislative and judicial powers. Section 5 of the Constitution vests the executive power of the Nigerian federation on the President personally.</p>

<p>There is a fee accrued to the different political offices in Nigeria which is required of candidates to pay. The concept is simple: when you pay you are allowed to run, you don’t and your offer is rescinded. For presidency, the fee is N100,000.</p>
