<h2 id=what-are-the-requirements-to-graduate-high-school-in-texas>What are the requirements to graduate high school in Texas?</h2>
<p>The Recommended High School Program, which a significant majority of students follow, mandates 26 credit hours in the following breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>four credits in English.</li>
<li>four credits in math.</li>
<li>four credits in science.</li>
<li>four credits in social studies.</li>
<li>two credits in a second language.</li>
<li>one credit in PE.</li>
<li>one credit in fine arts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=can-i-graduate-with-22-credits-in-texas>Can I graduate with 22 credits in Texas?</h2>
<p>State Graduation Requirements Students follow the high school graduation plan that was in place when they began ninth grade. The four graduation plans currently in use require students to earn 22 to 26 course credits. Students must pass five end-of-course assessments to meet the testing requirements for graduation.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-credits-do-you-need-to-graduate-high-school-in-louisiana>How many credits do you need to graduate high school in Louisiana?</h2>
<p>In Louisiana, all high students must meet or exceed the minimum course requirements to be eligible for high school graduation. Students are required to have 24 total units of credits to graduate; the units of credit are earned by successfully completing English, Mathematics and Science courses.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-passing-grade-in-texas-high-school>What is a passing grade in Texas high school?</h2>
<p>Passing means a minimum grade of 70 on all courses (except identified advanced classes).</p>
<h2 id=is-algebra-2-required-in-texas>Is Algebra 2 required in Texas?</h2>
<p>A student is not required by state law (Texas Education Code, Section 28.025) to successfully complete Algebra II as a requirement for high school graduation. However, there are potential consequences to a student who does not successfully complete an Algebra II course.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-graduate-without-passing-staar>Can you graduate without passing Staar?</h2>
<p>Texas has said fifth and eighth grade students who don’t pass required STAAR exams this year may move up to the next grades. But high school students must pass five subject-specific courses by the time they graduate, a requirement that will not be waived this year.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-credits-should-you-have-in-11th-grade>How many credits should you have in 11th grade?</h2>
<p>180 credits<br>
At the completion of each grade a student should have the following credits: 9th grade – 60 credits. 10th grade – 120 credits. 11th grade – 180 credits.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-requirements-to-graduate-from-texas-high-school>What are the requirements to graduate from Texas high school?</h2>
<p>The agency also offers information on district reports and ratings. Beginning with the 2014-2015 school year, Texas has only one high school graduation program. Students who enter the 9th grade and below during that school year must meet the requirements of Texas’s Foundation High School Program to graduate.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-texas-high-school-graduate-without-an-eoc>Can a Texas high school graduate without an EOC?</h2>
<p>A student who has failed the EOC assessment graduation requirements for no more than two courses may receive a Texas high school diploma if the student has qualified to graduate by means of an individual graduation committee (IGC) determination.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-go-to-school-in-texas>How old do you have to be to go to school in Texas?</h2>
<p>This rule requires school districts and charter schools to provide instruction to students in grades 9-12 on proper interaction with peace officers during traffic stops and other in-person encounters.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-15-year-old-graduate-from-high-school>Can a 15 year old graduate from high school?</h2>
<p>Some students wish to start working and earn their GED, or family or personal circumstances make it difficult to graduate from high school. Leaving school at 15 years old is not advised, as a high school diploma is a standard requirement in America today to be hired by most employers.</p>
