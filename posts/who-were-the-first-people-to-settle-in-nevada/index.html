<h2 id=who-were-the-first-people-to-settle-in-nevada>Who were the first people to settle in Nevada?</h2>
<p>Human habitation made have begun in Nevada 20,000 years ago. Explorers in the early 1800s found Mohave, Shoshoni, Washoe, and Paiute Indians living in Nevada. The first European explorer was Francisco Garces, a Spanish missionary, who visited in 1775 or 1776. Fur trappers and traders explored the area around 1825.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-people-start-settling-in-nevada>When did people start settling in Nevada?</h2>
<p>The first European to arrive in the area was Spanish friar Francisco Garcés in the 1700s. Few more Europeans ventured into the region until the 1800s. In 1827, fur trapper and explorer Jedediah Smith passed through the Las Vegas Valley on his way to California. He mapped out much of the area for future travelers.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-people-live-in-nevada>Where did the first people live in Nevada?</h2>
<p>Archaeological discoveries of bones and ashes in the southern portion of the state reveal that Native peoples lived there more than 20,000 years ago. Cave drawings left by these ancient people can be found in the Valley of Fire State Park near present-day Las Vegas.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-history-of-las-vegas-nevada>What is the history of Las Vegas Nevada?</h2>
<p>Traditional Native American arts and crafts have been revived on reservations and in urban colonies. Nevada’s frontier heritage is commemorated by annual pageants and festivals. During Helldorado Days, begun in 1905 and held in Las Vegas each May, the townspeople wear Western garb and take part in parades, rodeos, art shows, and sporting events.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fossils-were-found-in-nevada>What kind of fossils were found in Nevada?</h2>
<p>230Mil BC The Panthalassa Ocean covered much of what later became the western United States. Sediments later called the Luning Formation were deposited in what later became the mountain ranges of central Nevada. Fossil ichthyosaurs included Shonisaurus popularis. (NH, 6/01, p.22)</p>
<h2 id=when-was-elko-nevada-first-inhabited-by-people>When was Elko Nevada first inhabited by people?</h2>
<p>Though Elko lies along the route of the historic California Trail, it was first inhabited only in 1868, when it was at the east end of the railroad tracks built by the Central Pacific Railroad (the portion of the First Transcontinental Railroad built from California to Utah).</p>
