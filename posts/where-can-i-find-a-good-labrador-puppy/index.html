<p>Check if the dog’s eye color is brown or hazel. Look into the pup’s eyes to examine the color. If the dog is a yellow or black lab, check that the puppy has brown eyes. In the case of chocolate labs, check for brown or hazel eyes. In the past, some purebred labs have had yellow-green eyes.</p>

<h2 id=how-much-does-labrador-puppy-cost>How much does Labrador puppy cost?</h2>
<p>How much do Labradors cost to buy? The price of a Labrador puppy will vary from breeder to breeder, and from place to place. In the USA as a rough guide, you are looking at $800 to $1200.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-puppy-pug>How much is a puppy Pug?</h2>
<p>According to NextDayPets, the median price of a Pug is $1,247.50. A Pug with superior lineage will range anywhere from $2,500 up to $10,000, depending on the pedigree. Although you’re paying much more, it could be worth it knowing the dog comes from an excellent line. Of course, you can always adopt a Pug or a Pug mix.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-color-for-labrador>What is the best color for Labrador?</h2>
<p>When it comes to the best labrador colour, the general rule among the shooting fraternity is that black is good, yellow acceptable, but chocolate is strictly for the show bench. Black has always been the dominant colour in the shooting field and in trials.</p>
<h2 id=are-labrador-puppies-easy-to-train>Are Labrador puppies easy to train?</h2>
<p>Labradors are gundogs, bred to flush out, locate or retrieve game shot down by hunters. They are usually highly trainable, keen to please and have a balanced, pleasant temperament.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-tell-what-my-lab-is-mixed-with>How can I tell what my Lab is mixed with?</h2>
<p>Labrador mix bred dogs can often look very different to either of their parents. And in some cases, if the parentage is unknown it is entirely possible that they have more than one breed in their genetic makeup. The only way to know with reasonable certainty where your mixed breed dog came from, is to order a DNA test.</p>
<h2 id=do-labs-bark-a-lot>DO Labs bark a lot?</h2>
<p>Do Labradors Bark a Lot? Just like most dog breeds, Labs do bark and for a variety of different reasons. Without plenty of physical stimulation and social interaction, Labs will bark more than normal, possibly to excess, due to their pent-up energy.</p>
<h2 id=are-labrador-puppies-hard-work>Are Labrador puppies hard work?</h2>
<p>Labrador puppies are extremely hard work, I considered myself an experienced dog owner 2 years ago when Cassie came home at 8 weeks. The biting, “crocopup” behavior was off the scale, I’d never experienced it before with any other puppy, and the early weeks and months were a struggle. I had a lot to learn.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-puppies-do-pugs-have-first-time>How many puppies do Pugs have first time?</h2>
<p>For example, Pugs younger than 7 years old can have smaller litters, and in most cases, the first ever litter will tend to be on average smaller than most. So, you could expect your pug to have between 3 to 5 puppies in their first litter, but it’s by no means guaranteed.</p>
<h2 id=do-pugs-bite-you>Do Pugs bite you?</h2>
<p>Do Pugs Bite You? In general, as a breed, they are not known to be “biters” or of a vicious temperament. The shape of their mouth prevents them from biting efficiently which makes them reasonably harmless. As always, there can be some exceptions and care should always be taken.</p>
<h2 id=are-boy-or-girl-labs-better>Are boy or girl Labs better?</h2>
<p>Males may be more attentive than females. Males can be more protective of their things than females, although it is lessened with neutering. Males are more affectionate and more exuberant throughout their lifetime than females. Although both Lab boys and girls love food, males tend to be more food-motivated.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-such-a-thing-as-a-pug-lab-mix>Is there such a thing as a pug lab mix?</h2>
<p>Pug Lab Mix. The Pug Lab Mix, is a mixed breed dog resulting from breeding the Pug and the Labrador Retriever. This is obviously a very strange mix that is only accomplished by breeding the Male Pug (with some help) and the Female lab. This is more than likely done with In-Vitro fertilization.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-place-to-adopt-a-pug>Is there a place to adopt a pug?</h2>
<p>Pug rescues work hard to help homeless pugs find loving families. Please support Pug rescues and shelters in any way that you can, by donating funds, time and support. Our forum community has compiled a detailed list of local pug rescues – feel free to visit any of these rescues to adopt a pug into your family!</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-a-purebred-labrador-retriever-puppy>Where can I find a purebred Labrador Retriever puppy?</h2>
<p>In other parts of the world, use the puppy search tool on the website of your regional kennel club or equivalent authority. You may also ask a local veterinarian for a reference to a quality breeder. Another option is to keep an eye out for someone with a purebred Labrador and request information on where they adopted from.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-pug-mix-live-in-an-apartment>Can a pug mix live in an apartment?</h2>
<p>Pugs are moderately adaptable dogs. Although they do well in apartments as well as larger homes, they are particularly sensitive to heat and cold as a snub-nosed dog breed. They also do not like to be left alone for long periods of time. If the other parent breed is similar, then you should be able to expect the same from a Pug Mix.</p>
