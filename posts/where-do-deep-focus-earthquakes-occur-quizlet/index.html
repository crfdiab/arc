<h2 id=where-do-deep-focus-earthquakes-occur-quizlet>Where do deep-focus earthquakes occur quizlet?</h2>
<p>A deep-focus earthquake in seismology is an earthquake with a hypo center depth exceeding 300 km. They occur almost exclusively at oceanic-continental convergent boundaries in association with subducted oceanic lithosphere.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-intermediate-and-deep-focus-earthquakes-occur>Where do intermediate and deep-focus earthquakes occur?</h2>
<p>Since these earthquakes are closest to the Earth’s surface, they also generally cause the most damage. Intermediate-focus earthquakes occur at depths between 70 and 300 km, while deep-focus earthquakes occur at depths greater than 300 km below the Earth’s surface.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-accurate-way-to-measure-earthquake-magnitude>What is the most accurate way to measure earthquake magnitude?</h2>
<p>The Richter scale measures the largest wiggle (amplitude) on the recording, but other magnitude scales measure different parts of the earthquake. The USGS currently reports earthquake magnitudes using the Moment Magnitude scale, though many other magnitudes are calculated for research and comparison purposes.</p>
<h2 id=why-probably-do-deep-focus-earthquakes-stop-by-about-700-km-depth>Why probably do deep-focus earthquakes stop by about 700 km depth?</h2>
<p>Why do deep-focus earthquakes stop by about 700 km depth? Subducted slabs become more rigid below 700 km down. Subducted slabs remain rigid to about 1500 km down. It seems that the subducted slab has cooled sufficiently by that depth so that it loses its rigidity.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-a-deep-focus-earthquake-take-place>Where does a deep focus earthquake take place?</h2>
<p>DEEP FOCUS earthquakes or “intra plate” earthquakes, occur within the sub-ducting oceanic plates as they move beneath the continental plates. Appearing along fault lines, these are earthquakes with focus much deeper within the earth.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-deepest-earthquake-on-earth-occur>Where does the deepest earthquake on Earth occur?</h2>
<p>The deepest earthquakes occur within the core of subducting slabs – oceanic plates that descend into the Earth’s mantle from convergent plate boundaries, where a dense oceanic plate collides with a less dense continental plate and the former sinks beneath the latter.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-shallow-focus-earthquake>Which is an example of a shallow focus earthquake?</h2>
<p>For example, most earthquakes around the San Andreas Fault in California usually have a focus less than 20 km deep. Shallow focus earthquakes occur around a fault line such as the San Andreas Fault, and they are generally associated with mountain ranges or with mid-ocean ridges or trenches.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-common-place-for-earthquakes-to-occur>Which is the most common place for earthquakes to occur?</h2>
<p>The most common and the most destructive are the shallow focus earthquakes as they are closer to the surface and cause the most surface destruction. [2] Earthquakes occur generally along a fault plane under the earth at one point called the hypocenter or (focus) which is the spot below the earth where the earthquake originates.</p>
