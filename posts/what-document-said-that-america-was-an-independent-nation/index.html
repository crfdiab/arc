<p>The Declaration of Independence<br>
The Declaration of Independence, the founding document of the United States, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, and announced the separation of 13 North American British colonies from Great Britain.</p>
<h2 id=what-document-led-to-the-beginning-of-the-united-states>What document led to the beginning of the United States?</h2>
<p>The Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation, the first constitution of the United States, on November 15, 1777, but the states did not ratify them until March 1, 1781.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-us-state-declared-independence>Can a US state declared independence?</h2>
<p>It’s been well established that US states don’t have the authority to declare independence unilaterally. It is, however, entirely legal for Congress to grant a state independence.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-founding-documents-of-the-united-states>What are the founding documents of the United States?</h2>
<p>America’s Founding Documents. These three documents, known collectively as the Charters of Freedom, have secured the rights of the American people for more than two and a quarter centuries and are considered instrumental to the founding and philosophy of the United States.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-declaration-of-independence-a-legal-document>Is the declaration of Independence a legal document?</h2>
<p>The Declaration of Independence states the principles on which our government, and our identity as Americans, are based. Unlike the other founding documents, the Declaration of Independence is not legally binding, but it is powerful.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-country-to-issue-a-declaration-of-independence>What was the first country to issue a declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>The Declaration of Independence inspired many similar documents in other countries, the first being the 1789 Declaration of United Belgian States issued during the Brabant Revolution in the Austrian Netherlands.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-when-the-declaration-of-independence-was-signed>Who was president when the declaration of Independence was signed?</h2>
<p>On July 4, 1776, Continental Congress President John Hancock ‘s signature authenticated the United States Declaration of Independence. Historians have generally accepted McKean’s version of events, arguing that the famous signed version of the Declaration was created after July 19, and was not signed by Congress until August 2, 1776.</p>
