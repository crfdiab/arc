<h2 id=what-is-a-typical-paris-breakfast>What is a typical Paris breakfast?</h2>
<p>A typical breakfast in Paris is a croissant (buttery roll of flaky pastry) and/or a tartine (French bread sliced lengthwise, with butter and jam), café au lait (coffee with milk, also called café crème), and perhaps some fruit or juice.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-french-eat-every-day>What do the French eat every day?</h2>
<p>A typical weeknight dinner in France may look like a small starter such as shredded carrots, radishes, charcuterie, or olive tapenade, a simple main dish (grilled chicken, steak or salmon, served with potatoes, pasta, or green beans), and a yogurt with a piece of fruit, and a cookie or piece of chocolate.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-favorite-food-of-france>What is the favorite food of France?</h2>
<p>A hearty range of popular main dishes in France include meat, fish and poultry in a lineup that includes boeuf Bourguignon, steak frites, blanquette de veau, duck confit, cassoulet, bouillabaisse and coq au vin.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-french-drink-coffee-out-of>What do the French drink coffee out of?</h2>
<p>For the most part, the French drink espresso, albeit different types with varying amounts of water, foam, and milk. Ordering coffee in France can be daunting, especially if you don’t speak French. So before you order a café au lait or a cappuccino in a Parisian sidewalk café, make sure you know what you’re asking for.</p>
<h2 id=do-the-french-drink-tea-with-milk>Do the French drink tea with milk?</h2>
<p>Tea drinking also started to penetrate into French homes with most modeling their beverages å la anglaise; drinking it with milk and sugar. However, for the majority of homes in France, coffee became the hot beverage of choice.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-french-eat-for-breakfast-in-the-morning>What do the French eat for breakfast in the morning?</h2>
<p>However if you want to be truly French NEVER eat a croissant with butter, because French people never do that. The French have always preferred drinking coffee in the mornings, so it is expected that a traditional French breakfast is served with coffee. However, children are allowed to drink hot chocolate or fruit juice instead.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-bread-is-best-for-breakfast-in-france>What kind of bread is best for breakfast in France?</h2>
<p>Rich, buttery, tender, and slightly sweet, there’s nothing quite like French brioche bread. This classic French loaf makes wonderful breakfast toast, topped the French way with butter or fruit preserves. It is also great for grilled cheese, and makes a sturdy sandwich bread for brown bag lunches and picnics.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-make-for-breakfast-in-paris-france>What to make for breakfast in Paris France?</h2>
<p>For a truly impressive breakfast, add vanilla Chantilly cream and sautéed apples to your finished crepes. Ok, so these aren’t technically French, but if you are wandering the streets of Paris you are sure to find several food stands and cafes selling this sweet treat.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-third-stage-of-the-french-breakfast>What’s the third stage of the French breakfast?</h2>
<p>The third stage is then to soak the bread in a hot drink, which is another very important part of the French breakfast (take a look at the best breakfast places). The hot drink can first be coffee. A lot of French people cannot start a normal day without drinking first their coffee.</p>
