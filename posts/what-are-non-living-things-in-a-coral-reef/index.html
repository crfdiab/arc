<h2 id=what-are-non-living-things-in-a-coral-reef>What are non living things in a coral reef?</h2>
<p>A coral reef is an underwater ecosystem. It’s home to thousands of plant and animal species, to living and nonliving things, that all depend on each other. Nonliving things include the air, water, sunlight, soil, and minerals that animals, plants, bacteria, and other living things need to survive.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-non-living-organisms-in-the-ocean>What are non living organisms in the ocean?</h2>
<p>The non-living things are water, salt, gases, rocks, shells, and sometimes oil and trash. We all need to do our part to keep the ocean clean so the marine life is not harmed.</p>
<h2 id=is-sand-biotic-or-abiotic>Is Sand Biotic or abiotic?</h2>
<p>Abiotic factors are non-living things that “live” in an ecosystem that affect both the ecosystem and its surroundings. Some examples of Abiotic factors are the sun, rocks, water, and sand. Biotic factors are living organisms that affect other living organisms.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-find-non-living-thing-in-the-in-coral-reef>What can you find non living thing in the in coral reef?</h2>
<p>Seashells are one example of non-living things in a coral reef; there will be many seashells in evidence in a typical coral reef…some will be alive, and some will be non-living. For example, an oyster may be alive, but a cracked mussel shell will be non-living.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-live-in-the-coral-reef>What kind of animals live in the coral reef?</h2>
<p>The coral reef is an integral part of the cycle of life in the tropical seas, and are home to thousands of species of fish and invertebrates. The reef is made up of small colonial animals, called coral polyps.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-corals-considered-to-be-living-animals>Why are corals considered to be living animals?</h2>
<p>Understand that corals are living animals. Corals consist of small, colonial, plankton-eating invertebrate animals called polyps, which are anemone-like. Although corals are mistaken for non-living things, they are live animals. Corals are considered living animals because they fit into the five criteria that define them (1.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-snails-in-the-coral-reef>Are there any snails in the coral reef?</h2>
<p>You can find snail everywhere in the both land and sea. Even most of them are small but there is also a giant snail which is the giant africa snail that can reach its weight up to 900 g with its length up to 39 cm. Most of the snail feed on detritus but there are also scavenger and predator.</p>
