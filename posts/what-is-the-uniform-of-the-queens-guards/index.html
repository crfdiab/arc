The Queen’s Guard is the name given to the contingent of infantry responsible for guarding Buckingham Palace and St James’s Palace (including Clarence House) in London.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-queens-guards-names>What are the Queens Guards names?</h2>
<p>These five regiments are the Grenadier Guards, the Coldstream Guards, the Scots Guards, the Irish Guards and the Welsh Guards. Their uniforms all differ slightly – for example, the Grenadier Guards have single buttons evenly spaced, with a white plume on the left of their cap.</p>
<h2 id=are-buckingham-palace-guards-special-forces>Are Buckingham Palace Guards special forces?</h2>

<h2 id=how-often-do-the-buckingham-palace-guards-walk-the-beat>How often do the Buckingham Palace guards walk the beat?</h2>
<p>Typically, a Guardsman spends two hours on duty and four off. He is not expected to stand still for any more than ten minutes at a time. Every so often, he will march up and down in front of his sentry box, rather like a policeman “walking the beat”.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-5-regiments-of-the-british-army>What are the 5 regiments of the British Army?</h2>
<p>The five regiments are the Grenadier Guards, the Coldstream Guards, the Scots Guards, the Irish Guards, and Welsh Guards. To understand the rank structure of the guards, a lance corporal has two chevrons instead of one.</p>
