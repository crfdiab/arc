<h2 id=why-did-slavery-divide-the-country>Why did slavery divide the country?</h2>
<p>It had many causes, but there were two main issues that split the nation: first was the issue of slavery, and second was the balance of power in the federal government. The South was primarily an agrarian society. Throughout the South were large plantations that grew cotton, tobacco and other labor-intensive crops.</p>
<h2 id=what-regions-did-slavery-take>What regions did slavery take?</h2>
<p>It is important to remember that the North American mainland was a relatively minor destination in the global slave-trading network. Less than 4% of all African slaves were sent to North America. The vast majority of enslaved people ended up in sugar-producing regions of Brazil and the West Indies.</p>
<h2 id=what-region-of-the-us-had-the-most-slaves>What region of the US had the most slaves?</h2>
<p>In the South, the percentage of the population that was enslaved was extraordinarily high: over 70 percent in most counties along the Mississippi River and parts of the South Carolina and Georgia coast. This animation shows the percentage of the population enslaved from 1790 to 1860.</p>

<h2 id=unlawful-recruitment-and-use-of-child-soldiers-what-was-the-total-population-of-slaves-in-the-south>Unlawful Recruitment and Use of Child Soldiers. What was the total population of slaves in the south?</h2>
<p>Driven by labor demands from new cotton plantations in the Deep South, the northern slave states sold over a million enslaved people who were taken to the Deep South in a forced migration. The total population of enslaved people in the South eventually reached four million.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-slavery-and-enslavement-related-to-each-other>How is slavery and enslavement related to each other?</h2>
<p>Slavery. Slavery and enslavement are both the state and the condition of being a slave, who is someone forbidden to quit their service for another person and is treated as property. Slavery relies heavily on the enslaved person being intimidated either by the threat of violence or some other method of abuse.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-issue-of-slavery-affect-the-united-states>How did the issue of slavery affect the United States?</h2>
<p>The United States became ever more polarized over the issue of slavery, split into slave and free states. Driven by labor demands from new cotton plantations in the Deep South, the northern slave states sold over a million enslaved people who were taken to the Deep South in a forced migration.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-african-american-families-live-during-slavery>Where did African American families live during slavery?</h2>
<p>Mulberry Plantation, South Carolina. On large plantations, slave cabins and the yards of the slave quarters served as the center of interactions among enslaved family members. Here were spaces primarily occupied by African Americans, somewhat removed from the labor of slavery or the scrutiny of owners,…</p>
