<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-buy-a-country>Is it possible to buy a country?</h2>
<p>Apparently, you can’t really buy a country. The point is, the idea of just amassing a lot of money and then making an offer to a country in need of some funds is basically a pipe dream. If you are committed to the dream, there are some opportunities to start your own country. Buying islands are very real.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-nation>How much does it cost to buy a nation?</h2>
<p>List of territory purchased by a sovereign nation from another sovereign nation</p>
<table><tr><th>Territory</th><th>Purchased by</th><th>Cost/Area</th></tr><tr><td>California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona</td><td>United States</td><td>13.4 USD/km²</td></tr><tr><td>Arizona (southern)</td><td>United States</td><td>130 USD/km²</td></tr><tr><td>New Mexico (southwestern)</td></tr><tr><td>Saxe-Lauenburg</td><td>Prussia</td><td>2,500 Rigsdaler/km²</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-much-does-the-cheapest-country-cost>How much does the cheapest country cost?</h2>
<p>According to this data, Pakistan is the cheapest country to live in, with a cost of living index of 18.58. This is followed by Afghanistan (24.51), India (25.14), and Syria (25.31).</p>
<h2 id=can-billionaires-buy-countries>Can Billionaires Buy countries?</h2>
<p>Is it even legal? Even though Bezos does have enough money to buy a country, he could never do so. It is against international law for an individual to purchase a country.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-create-your-own-country>Is it legal to create your own country?</h2>
<p>Starting your own country isnt impossible. Its just going to require a lot of patience and the right friends. As tempting as it might be to declare your cubicle a sovereign state, customary international law actually does specify minimum standards for statehood. You must have a defined territory.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-buy-the-moon>Can you buy the moon?</h2>
<p>“…is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.” In other words no country can claim ownership of the Moon. He once sold a country-sized plot of lunar land, 2.66 million acres of lunar land, for $250,000.</p>
<h2 id=which-countries-can-jeff-bezos-buy>Which countries can Jeff Bezos buy?</h2>
<p>United States. $19 362.1. 193.6.</p>
<ol start=16>
<li>China. $11 937.6. 119.4.</li>
<li>Japan. $4 884.5. 48.8.</li>
<li>Germany. $3 651.9. 36.5.</li>
<li>France. $2 574.8. 25.7.</li>
<li>United Kingdom. $2 565.1. 25.7.</li>
<li>India. $2 439. 24.4.</li>
<li>Brazil. $2 080.9. 20.8.
Has anyone ever bought a country?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Has any individual ever purchased an independent country before in history? Yes ! The country name is Principality of the Pontinha and the owner is Renato Barros, who bought the nation (or a bedroom sized rock) with a mere cost of €25,000 in the year 2000.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-transport-a-car-across-the-country>How much does it cost to transport a car across the country?</h2>
<p>If you’re planning to use an open-air carrier to move your car, expect to pay anywhere from $600 to upwards of $1,600. For more details on auto transport costs, including factors that affect the overall price of transporting a vehicle across the country, keep reading.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-countries-where-you-can-start-your-own-country>Are there any countries where you can start your own country?</h2>
<p>The main exception is Antarctica. Even then, should you brave the weather and lack of “population appeal,” Antarctica is managed by the most powerful countries in the world, and it’s unlikely they’ll let you just plant a flag and say, “Mine!” Second, there is Bir Tawil, a tiny plot of land between Egypt and Sudan, which neither claim.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-buy-an-island-in-the-world>Is it possible to buy an island in the world?</h2>
<p>If you’re wealthy enough, you can buy an island, though it’s unlikely that the host nation will just cede sovereignty to you. A more corrupt or destitute country might be more easily swayed, but even that is difficult: a pack of libertarians tried to buy Tortuga from impoverished Haiti, but were rejected.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-private-jet>How much does it cost to buy a private jet?</h2>
<p>You could, of course, go all out and buy a private jet. Depending on the age, make, and model, private jets cost anywhere between several hundred thousand dollars for an older used model, to tens of millions of dollars for a state-of-the-art private jet with all the bells and whistles.</p>
