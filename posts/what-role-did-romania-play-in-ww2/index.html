<h2 id=what-role-did-romania-play-in-ww2>What role did Romania play in ww2?</h2>
<p>As a member of the Axis, Romania joined the invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, providing equipment and oil to Nazi Germany as well as committing more troops to the Eastern Front than all the other allies of Germany combined.</p>
<h2 id=what-side-did-romania-fight-on-in-ww2>What side did Romania fight on in ww2?</h2>
<p>eastern front<br>
So on July 5, 1940, Romania allied itself with Nazi Germany—only to be invaded by its “ally” as part of Hitler’s strategy to create one huge eastern front against the Soviet Union.</p>
<h2 id=did-bulgaria-fight-in-ww2>Did Bulgaria fight in ww2?</h2>
<p>Bulgaria resisted Axis pressure to join the war against the Soviet Union, which began on 22 June 1941, but did declare war on Britain and the United States on 13 December 1941. The Red Army entered Bulgaria on 8 September 1944; Bulgaria declared war on Germany the next day.</p>
<h2 id=what-means-did-romania-employ-to-gain-independence>What means did Romania employ to gain independence?</h2>
<p>Romania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire after the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), in which the Ottomans fought against the Russian empire. In the Treaty of Bucharest of 1913, Romania gained Southern Dobruja and established the Durostor and Caliacra counties.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-bulgarians-died-in-world-war-ii>How many Bulgarians died in World War II?</h2>
<p>Deaths by Country</p>
<table><tr><th>Country</th><th>Military Deaths</th><th>Total Civilian and Military Deaths</th></tr><tr><td>Bulgaria</td><td>22,000</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>45,400</td><td>45,400</td></tr><tr><td>China</td><td>3-4,000,000</td><td>20,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Czechoslovakia</td><td>25,000</td><td>345,000</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-side-was-turkey-on-in-ww2>What side was Turkey on in WW2?</h2>
<p>Turkey remained neutral until the final stages of World War II and tried to maintain an equal distance between both the Axis and the Allies until February 1945, when Turkey entered the war on the side of the Allies against Germany and Japan.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-romania-get-involved-in-world-war-2>How did Romania get involved in World War 2?</h2>
<p>On 13 April 1939, France and the United Kingdom had pledged to guarantee the independence of the Kingdom of Romania. Negotiations with the Soviet Union concerning a similar guarantee collapsed when Romania refused to allow the Red Army to cross its frontiers. On 23 August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-prime-minister-of-romania-in-world-war-1>Who was the Prime Minister of Romania in World War 1?</h2>
<p>At the outbreak of World War I, the new Romanian Prime Minister, Ion C. Brătianu (1865-1927) was able to prevent King Carol I and the conservative Germanophile politician Petre P. Carp (1837-1919) from engaging the country in war alongside the Triple Alliance.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-romania-important-to-the-central-powers>Why was Romania important to the Central Powers?</h2>
<p>The aim of the counter-attack of the Central Powers consisted first in expelling the enemy from Transylvania and next in eliminating Romania as a military factor for the rest of war and getting hold of its resources (especially food and mineral oil) which were classified as strategic.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-bucharest-peace-treaty-do-for-romania>What did the Bucharest peace treaty do for Romania?</h2>
<p>The Bucharest Peace Treaty put an end to the Second Balkan War and gave Romania territorial expansion on the coast with Bulgaria against Austria’s will, showing the signs of a new orientation of Romanian foreign policy.</p>
