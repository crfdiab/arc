<h2 id=how-long-was-the-journey-across-the-red-sea>How long was the journey across the Red Sea?</h2>
<p>In approximately a nine hour period, from 18.00 hrs to 03.00 hrs, over 2,000,000 Israelites with their goods and their flocks crossed, and the Egyptian armies entered the Sea.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-the-israelites-walk-through-the-red-sea>How long did the Israelites walk through the Red Sea?</h2>
<p>Exodus 12:29 (“midnight,” Israel told to leave Egypt) and Exodus 14:27 (“morning appeared,” Red Sea covered Egyptians) would give us an estimation of less than six hours, for the Jews to enter the Red Sea and safely pass through to the other shore.</p>

<p>The other two stages were about 11 to 13 miles apart. The distance across the Red Sea is roughly 12 miles, depending where you measure the crossing, so it was a typical travel distance for a day’s journey.
