<h2 id=why-is-chi-chi-so-hated>Why is Chi-Chi so hated?</h2>
<p>Fans dislike Chi Chi for basically being an overprotective parent to Gohan despite both the fact he’s far more capable in a fight for a child and that when the world needs to be saved Gohan needs to help out. Chi Chi comes off as ridiculously selfish and unable to see reason that Gohan is going to be fine.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-chi-chi-always-mad-at-goku>Why is Chi-Chi always mad at Goku?</h2>
<p>10 WHY CHI-CHI ALWAYS YELLS AT GOKU Goku is an absent and negligent father and husband at times, usually more preoccupied with training and fighting. As a result, Chi-Chi tends to yell at Goku a lot, usually to get him to put at least a fraction of the effort he puts into fighting into being a good dad.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-chi-chi-afraid-of>What is Chi-Chi afraid of?</h2>
<p>Chi Chi isn’t afraid of anything. She’s fearless, will speak her mind and do whatever she wants no matter what danger she puts herself in.</p>
<h2 id=who-does-chi-chi-have-a-crush-on>Who does Chi-Chi have a crush on?</h2>
<p>Son Goku<br>
11-year old Chi-Chi first met Son Goku when her father Gyu Mao sent him to get the Bancho-Fan, a magical fan that would put out the fire surrounding their castle. After Goku asked Chi-Chi if she was a girl in the most personal manner, she developed a crush on him, believing his advances to be a sign of affection.</p>
<h2 id=does-chi-chi-actually-love-goku>Does Chi Chi actually love Goku?</h2>
<p>Chichi has always been honest about her love for Goku and has said she can never stay angry at him for long because she loves him. Goku has only said “I love you” to Chichi once, which was after the Kid Buu battle ended.</p>
<h2 id=is-chi-chi-a-bad-character>Is Chi Chi a bad character?</h2>
<p>Chi-Chi is not horrible at all, there are some hyperboles that would show otherwise in the show, but there are scenes that completely justify it, I believe in Super she even admits that she’s so headstrong because she needs to be to deal with Goku, and Goku even says that that’s what she loves about Chi-Chi, in his and …</p>
<h2 id=why-cant-vegeta-go-ssj3>Why can’t Vegeta go SSJ3?</h2>
<p>The reason Vegeta could’nt go SSJ3 is because Goku is a Honour Gene. Honour Gene’s can go SSJ3. However, Vegeta wasn’t a Honour, instead he is a Pride Gene. Pride Gene’s can only go SSJ, ASSJ, USSJ, SSJ2, and SSJ4.</p>
<h2 id=will-goku-leave-chi-chi>Will Goku leave Chi Chi?</h2>
<p>Goku and Chi Chi’s marriage is a bit weird, but that doesn’t mean they don’t care one about the other. Hence, Goku has no reason for leaving her.</p>
<h2 id=is-bulma-scared-of-chi-chi>Is Bulma scared of Chi-Chi?</h2>
<p>Originally Answered: Is Bulma Afraid of Cho-Chi? She is, and for good reason. Chi Chi is a former martial artist, trained in the Turtle Hermit style, via Ox King (a former pupil of Master Roshi), where Bulma is a rich scientist.</p>
<h2 id=is-chi-chi-stronger-than-goku>Is Chi-Chi stronger than Goku?</h2>
<p>Chi-Chi and Goku’s relationship goes way back to the start of the Dragon Ball series. Compared to martial arts and strength, Goku wins by a long shot, but when it comes to practical matters unrelated to fighting, Chi-Chi comes out on top.</p>
<h2 id=does-chi-chi-die>Does Chi Chi die?</h2>
<p>Chi Chi DeVayne, known for her appearances in “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars,” has died after a battle with pneumonia. “I am heartbroken to learn of the passing of Chi Chi DeVayne,” he said in a statement on Thursday. “I am so grateful that we got to experience her kind and beautiful soul.</p>
<h2 id=is-chi-chi-stronger-than-goku-1>Is Chi Chi stronger than Goku?</h2>
<h2 id=what-happens-in-episode-7-of-the-chi>What happens in Episode 7 of the Chi?</h2>
<p>It’s been a really long time coming but Showtime’s coming of age drama, ‘The Chi’, has finally resolved one of the longest storylines of Season 3. Fans have been desperately clamoring for Keisha (Birgundi Baker) to get rescued from her kidnapper, Omari (Cedric Mays), for quite some time now and Episode 7, ‘A Stain’, finally delivered.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-third-season-of-the-chi>Is there a third season of the Chi?</h2>
<p>The third season, however, has premiered with a new storyline that involves Kiesha Williams and many viewers have been left devastated about her fate on the series. The third season premiered with the mysterious disappearance of Kiesha Williams (Birgundi Baker).</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-kiesha-williams-on-the-chi>What happens to Kiesha Williams on the Chi?</h2>
<p>The second episode of the series was dominated by that as Kiesha was still nowhere to be found after a few days search. Then, Nina and Dre went to her school, but they were shocked to find that Kiesha has missed a lot of classes lately. They finally managed to track down Kiesha’s phone from her laptop which led them to Ronnie.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-chi-chi-do-in-memories-of-gohan>What did Chi Chi do in memories of Gohan?</h2>
<p>Although Chi-Chi is insistent to Goku that Gohan’s studies are more important than anything in the world, she, along with the rest of the characters around them, goes into shock when Goku actually agrees with her (in ” Memories of Gohan “). She even goes as far as checking his temperature to make sure he was feeling well.</p>
