<h2 id=why-are-flights-to-brazil-so-expensive>Why are flights to Brazil so expensive?</h2>
<p>It’s because of corruption, ridiculously high taxes, and logistics bottlenecks that make Brazil what it is: one of the most costly countries to do business in. It surely is one of the most costly countries to fly to.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-travel-from-usa-to-brazil-now>Can I travel from USA to Brazil now?</h2>

Following a brief closure in 2020, the borders are now open, including to almost all tourists, for stays of up to 90 days. Brazil has also banned flights coming from or transiting through India and South Africa.</p>

<ol>
<li>Marriage to a Brazilian national.</li>
<li>Having a child with a Brazilian national.</li>
