<h2 id=did-the-spanish-destroy-the-mayan-books>Did the Spanish destroy the Mayan books?</h2>
<p>Background. There were many books in existence at the time of the Spanish conquest of Yucatán in the 16th century; most were destroyed by the Catholic priests. Many in Yucatán were ordered destroyed by Bishop Diego de Landa in July 1562.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-spanish-burn-mayan-books>Why did the Spanish burn Mayan books?</h2>
<p>Having determined that the precious and zealously guarded Mayan books he had been shown with great pride—precisely because of his evident empathy—contained “nothing in which there was not to be seen superstition and lies of the devil,” he ordered all of the books to be burned “…which [the Maya] regretted to an amazing …</p>

<p>There were many books in existence at the time of the Spanish conquest of Yucatán in the 16th century; most were destroyed by the Catholic priests. Many in Yucatán were ordered destroyed by Bishop Diego de Landa in July 1562.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-spanish-destroy-mayan-culture>When did the Spanish destroy Mayan culture?</h2>
<p>1697<br>
The Maya occupied a territory that is now incorporated into the modern countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras and El Salvador; the conquest began in the early 16th century and is generally considered to have ended in 1697.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-favorite-drink-of-the-mayan-people>What was the favorite drink of the Mayan people?</h2>
<p>Balché is a mildly intoxicating beverage that was commonly consumed by the ancient Maya in what is now Mexico and upper Central America. Today, it is still common among the Yucatec Maya. The drink is made from the bark of a leguminous tree, Lonchocarpus violaceus, which is soaked in honey and water, and fermented.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-mayan-books-are-still-in-existence-today>How many Mayan books are still in existence today?</h2>
<p>Today, only three or four Maya codices remain. Three of them are named for the European cities where they are kept—Dresden, Paris, and Madrid. The authenticity of a fourth book called the Grolier Codex, now in Mexico City, is still disputed.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-spanish-do-to-the-mayans>What did the Spanish do to the Mayans?</h2>
<p>The Spanish colonization entailed forced labor and mandatory conversion to Christianity. Those Maya who refused to give up their pantheistic religious practices were arrested and tortured for heresy. Mayan artifacts were actively destroyed and all but a few of their sacred texts burnt.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-mayans-famous-for>What were the Mayans famous for?</h2>
<p>The Ancient Mayans developed the science of astronomy, calendar systems, and hieroglyphic writing. They were also known for creating elaborate ceremonial architecture, such as pyramids, temples, palaces, and observatories. These structures were all built without metal tools. The Maya were skilled weavers and potters.</p>
<h2 id=what-sweet-treat-did-the-mayans-create>What sweet treat did the Mayans create?</h2>
<p>Centuries later, the Mayans praised chocolate as the drink of the gods. Mayan chocolate was a revered brew made of roasted and ground cacao seeds mixed with chillies, water and cornmeal. Mayans poured this mixture from one pot to another, creating a thick foamy beverage called “xocolatl”, meaning “bitter water.”</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-maya-value-most>What did the Maya value most?</h2>
<p>The Maya believed deeply in a cycle of life, nothing really ever died, or was born. This belief strongly impacted their view of their world. Their ideas involving outer space encouraged their efforts in architecture, math, and astronomy.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-burning-of-the-maya-books-take-place>Where did the burning of the Maya books take place?</h2>
<p>The burning of [Maya] books In a single act of wanton zealotry, the Spanish friar Diego de Landa burned, by his own account, 27 priceless Maya screenfold manuscripts in front of the church in the 4,000-year-old town of Maní, on the Yucatan peninsula, on the evening of July 12th., 1562.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-diego-de-landa-burn-the-maya-books>Why did Diego de Landa burn the Maya books?</h2>
<p>Diego de Landa could not read the books, and there were very few Maya left who could, but he knew that they had to be destroyed along with the physical remnants of the old Maya religion that were on that pile in front of the monastery waiting to be torched. The Franciscan would later recall the event with specific reference to the Maya codices.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-fray-diego-do-to-the-books-of-the-mayas>What did Fray Diego do to the books of the Mayas?</h2>
<p>Fray Diego de Landa throws into the flames, one after the other, the books of the Mayas. The inquisitor curses Satan, and the fire crackles and devours.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-roman-catholic-bishop-who-destroyed-the-maya>Who was the Roman Catholic bishop who destroyed the Maya?</h2>
<p>After hearing of Roman Catholic Maya who continued to practice ” idol worship ,” on July 12, 1562 Bishop Diego de Landa ordered an Inquisition in Mani, Yucatan, ending with the ceremony called auto de fe.</p>
