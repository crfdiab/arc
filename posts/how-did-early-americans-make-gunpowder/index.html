<h2 id=how-did-early-americans-make-gunpowder>How did early Americans make gunpowder?</h2>
<p>If gunpowder was to be made in America, it needed a strong supply of saltpeter, and America, like England, had a severe shortage of natural saltpeter or nitrates. When decomposition was complete, the heaps were leached with water, the liquor evaporated, and the saltpeter recrystallized.”</p>
<h2 id=who-supplied-90-percent-of-the-gunpowder-the-patriots-used-in-the-american-revolutionary-war>Who supplied 90 percent of the gunpowder the Patriots used in the American Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>At first, French support was covert: French agents sent the Patriots military aid (predominantly gunpowder) through a company called Rodrigue Hortalez et Compagnie, beginning in the spring of 1776. Estimates place the percentage of French supplied arms to the Americans in the Saratoga campaign at up to 90%.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-gunpowder-was-used-in-the-revolutionary-war>How much gunpowder was used in the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>In all, domestic gunpowder milling only produced 100,000 pounds of powder from 1775 through 1777, but it helped the American forces sustain their army at a critical time for survival.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-gunpowder-incident-in-1775>Who was involved in the Gunpowder Incident in 1775?</h2>
<p>Gunpowder Incident. The Gunpowder Incident (or Gunpowder Affair) was a conflict early in the American Revolutionary War between Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia, and militia led by Patrick Henry. On April 20, 1775, one day after the Battles of Lexington and Concord…</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-try-to-control-guns-in-the-colonies>Why did the British try to control guns in the colonies?</h2>
<p>From 1768 through 1776 the Brits vainly attempted gun control in the Colonies. The British feared that, absent “gun control”, the militias in the colonies could become as “regulated” and fearsome as the British “Regulars” themselves.

<h2 id=what-was-the-use-of-cannon-in-the-thirteen-colonies>What was the use of cannon in the Thirteen Colonies?</h2>
<p>With the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies, cannon saw use in English armies in the North American mainland, first against the rival colony of New France. However, although the French were outnumbered, their fortifications and artillery were superior to English cannon.</p>
