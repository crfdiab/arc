<h2 id=why-petrol-prices-are-high-in-india-compared-to-other-countries>Why petrol prices are high in India compared to other countries?</h2>
<p>Thus Indian Government spends approximately 5300 Rupees to get 1 barrel of crude oil. The difference between revenue and expenditure of the government is called fiscal deficit. These two together cover the prices of the petrol. The average tax paid by the users is almost 150% on the price paid by the dealers.</p>
<h2 id=why-petrol-prices-are-still-high-in-india>Why petrol prices are still high in India?</h2>
<p>India meets its domestic oil demand mainly through imports. While international crude prices have risen sharply in the last six months, a major reason for the high selling price of petrol is the high levy of local taxes. The Union government levies excise duty and cess on fuel, and states levy a value added tax (VAT).</p>
<h2 id=why-prices-are-rising-in-india>Why prices are rising in India?</h2>
<p>High fuel costs and rising prices of manufactured goods took India’s wholesale price index (WPI) inflation to a record high of 12.94 per cent on a year-on-year basis in May. CPI inflation in food and beverages rose to a six-month high of 5.2 per cent this May compared with 8.3 per cent in May last year.</p>
<h2 id=how-petrol-prices-are-decided-in-india>How petrol prices are decided in India?</h2>
<p>Fuel prices in India are revised daily based on the changing crude oil prices globally. As global crude oil prices go up, the import cost also increases. But that’s just one reason for the high retail prices. The remainder of the amount is just state and central government taxes.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-highest-tax-on-petrol>Which country has highest tax on petrol?</h2>
<p>India now has the highest taxes on fuel in the world!</p>
<ul>
<li>Excise duty: On petrol, the duty levied is Rs 32.98 a litre, while on diesel it is Rs 31.83 per litre.</li>
<li>VAT: It varies from state to state, with Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan, Karnataka levying over 30 per cent VAT — the highest among states.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=will-petrol-prices-come-down-in-india>Will petrol prices come down in India?</h2>
<p>Even though crude oil prices have fallen significantly between July 2 and 19; from $ 78.34 to $ 68.62, petrol-diesel prices have not come down significantly in India. This had increased to ₹101.84 and 89.87 per litre on July 20, 2021.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-fuel-price-increasing>Why is fuel price increasing?</h2>
<p>Fuel prices have been rising in the country due to a gradual recovery in international crude oil rates. For the last few weeks, the recovery in global crude demand has accelerated, with benchmark Brent Crude Oil crossing $76 per barrel.</p>

<h2 id=why-is-the-price-of-petrol-higher-in-the-us-than-in-india>Why is the price of petrol higher in the US than in India?</h2>
<p>Although the price and inflation reflect the crude oil price movements, political uncertainty of the US-Arabia relationship has resulted in a higher long-term inflation volatility than in India. The US only pays about half of what India pays per litre of petrol but the inflation has much more uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-price-of-petrol-revised-in-india>When is the price of petrol revised in India?</h2>
<p>Prices are revised at 06:00 a.m. every day. This makes sure that even a minute’s variation in global oil prices can be transmitted to fuel users and dealers. Price of fuel includes excise duty, value added tax (VAT), and dealer commission.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-long-term-inflation-rate-for-petrol>What’s the long term inflation rate for petrol?</h2>
<p>Meaning if the long-term inflation in our fuel is 6-8%, businesses will jack up prices by at least 8-10% more to survive. This means our long-term inflation will be at least 8% (perhaps more if fuel price uncertainty becomes higher). This is the US consumer price index. Notice the sudden change in slope when oil prices increased.</p>

<p>Prices are revised at 06:00 a.m. every day. This makes sure that even a minute’s variation in global oil prices can be transmitted to fuel users and dealers.
