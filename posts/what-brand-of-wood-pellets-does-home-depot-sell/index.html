<p>Softwood pellets actually rate at about 10-15% higher in BTU (more heat) than hardwood pellets. This is because softwood contains resins that have a higher heat value than hardwood fibre. Softwood pellets also generate less harmful airborne particulate emissions making them much better for the environment.</p>

<p>Pellet stoves do not emit any smoke unlike traditional wood burning stoves. The exhaust from a pellet stove is cooler than a wood burning stove and does not require a full chimney. A stove will usually give off a smoke smell the first time it is fired up for the burn season, but that smokey smell is normal.</p>
