<h2 id=what-makes-the-mexican-revolution-unique>What makes the Mexican Revolution unique?</h2>
<p>The Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910, ended dictatorship in Mexico and established a constitutional republic. Though a constitution drafted in 1917 formalized many of the reforms sought by rebel groups, periodic violence continued into the 1930s. …</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-mexican-revolution-a-revolution>Why was the Mexican Revolution a revolution?</h2>
<p>The Revolution began with a call to arms on 20th November 1910 to overthrow the current ruler and dictator Porfirio Díaz Mori. In an attempt to strengthen ties with the United States and other influential foreign interests, Díaz allocated land, once belonging to the people of Mexico, to wealthy non-nationals.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-significance-of-the-mexican-revolution>What was the significance of the Mexican Revolution?</h2>
<p>The Mexican Revolution was a political revolution that reformed the state. This explains why Mexico today, despite all its historically important great reforms, is a bourgeois country. Different groupings may hold the governing positions, even at the summits of power, but this does not change the class structure of society.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-mexican-revolution-affect-the-working-class>How did the Mexican Revolution affect the working class?</h2>
<p>The infant Mexican working class was beginning to find its feet. Important labour struggles, starting with the Cananea miners’ strike, were shaking Mexico. Feeling the ground quake beneath his feet, Díaz was forced to hold an election in 1910, but in order to make sure he won it he threw his main opponent, Madero, in prison.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-weakness-of-the-mexican-revolution>What was the weakness of the Mexican Revolution?</h2>
<p>The weakness of the Mexican revolution was the weakness of a peasant revolution. The peasantry was strong enough to overthrow the existing order, but not to put its decisive stamp upon Mexico’s historical destiny. This is no exception to the rule.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-winner-of-the-mexican-revolution>Who was the winner of the Mexican Revolution?</h2>
<p>Mexican Revolution. Díaz had him arrested and declared himself the winner after a mock election in June, but Madero, released from prison, published his Plan de San Luis Potosí from San Antonio, Texas, calling for a revolt on November 20. The revolt was a failure, but it kindled revolutionary hope in many quarters.</p>
