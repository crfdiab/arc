<h2 id=how-did-nevada-get-its-capital>How did Nevada get its capital?</h2>
<p>The city’s origins are closely linked to the creation of the state of Nevada. In 1861, when the Nevada Territory was established, Carson City was named the capital of the territorial government. Three years later, when statehood was bestowed, Carson City was designated the official state capital.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-capital-of-nevada-change>When did the capital of Nevada change?</h2>
<p>For more than 50 years, all three parts of the state government were housed in the Capitol. The Supreme Court met here until 1937, when it relocated into an adjacent building, and the Nevada Legislature met here until 1971, when it relocated to its new Legislative Building just south of the Capitol.</p>
