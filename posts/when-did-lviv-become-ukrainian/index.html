<h2 id=when-did-lviv-become-ukrainian>When did Lviv become Ukrainian?</h2>
<p>1944<br>
After the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Lviv became part of the Soviet Union, and in 1944–46 there was a population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine. In 1991, it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-polish-people-live-in-lviv>How many Polish people live in Lviv?</h2>
<p>Most Poles who remained in Ukraine were and are concentrated in Zhytomyr Oblast (about 49,000), Khmelnytskyi Oblast (about 20,000), and Lviv Oblast (about 19,000).</p>
<h2 id=is-lviv-or-kiev-better>Is Lviv or Kiev better?</h2>
<p>Generally I would say go to Kyiv as there is a lot more to keep you busy but if you are looking for relaxing atmosphere and slower pace, then I would recommend Lviv. You could go to Kyiv and then Minsk and then Brest and on to Poland.</p>
<h2 id=is-lviv-ukraine-safe>Is Lviv Ukraine safe?</h2>
<p>Lviv is very safe. The city is extremely tourist-friendly and you would have no trouble at all walking around the Old City at night. Just be aware of your belongings when you are in a crowded area, just like any big cities. That said, I personally find it to be safer than most crowded western European cities.</p>
<h2 id=how-expensive-is-lviv>How expensive is Lviv?</h2>
<p>Summary about cost of living in Lviv, Ukraine: Family of four estimated monthly costs are 1,431$ (38,391₴) without rent. A single person estimated monthly costs are 417$ (11,173₴) without rent. Lviv is 69.29% less expensive than New York (without rent).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-lviv-in-2015>What was the population of Lviv in 2015?</h2>
<p>Answer: Lviv (L’viv, Львів), Ukraine ( Administrative unit: Lvivska oblast) – last known population is ≈ 729 400 (year 2015). This was 1.627% of total Ukraine population. If population growth rate would be same as in period 2014-2015 (+0.05%/year), Lviv population in 2019 would be: 730 995*.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-the-city-of-lviv>What was the history of the city of Lviv?</h2>
<p>Prior to the creation of the modern state of Ukraine, Lviv had been part of numerous states and empires, including, under the name Lwów, Poland and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth; under the name Lemberg, the Austrian and later Austro-Hungarian Empires; the short-lived West Ukrainian People’s Republic after World War I;</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-of-the-people-of-lviv>What was the religion of the people of Lviv?</h2>
<p>During Habsburg rule, Lviv became one of the most important Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish cultural centres. In Lviv, according to the Austrian census of 1910, which listed religion and language, 51% of the city’s population were Roman Catholics, 28% Jews, and 19% belonged to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-city-of-lviv-a-polish-or-ukrainian-city>Is the city of Lviv a Polish or Ukrainian city?</h2>
<p>Lviv was a seat of both Polish/Catholic and Ruthenian aka Ukrainian / Greek Catholic and Orthodox institutions. Its importance to both Polish and Ukrainian cultural traditions cannot be overestimated.</p>
