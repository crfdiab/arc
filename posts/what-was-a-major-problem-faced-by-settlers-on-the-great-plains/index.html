<h2 id=what-was-a-major-problem-faced-by-settlers-on-the-great-plains>What was a major problem faced by settlers on the Great Plains?</h2>
<p>There were many problems farmers faced when they went to settle on the Great Plains. One of the problems was the land. The soil was much more difficult to farm in the Great Plains. Regular plows could not break the sod.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-challenges-of-the-great-plains>What were the challenges of the Great Plains?</h2>
<p>Water shortages – low rainfall and few rivers and streams meant there was not enough water for crops or livestock. Few building materials – there were not many trees on the Great Plains so there was little timber to use for building houses or fences. Many had to build houses out of earth.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-railroads-both-help-and-hurt-the-settlers-in-the-west>How did the railroads both help and hurt the settlers in the West?</h2>
<p>How did the railroad both help and hurt the settlers who sought opportunities in the West, and how did farmers respond to it? Railroads helped shorten the long cattle drives and it provided a quicker way to the east. But it hurt them because railroads charged more for storage as they were waiting to be shipped.</p>
<h2 id=what-steps-did-farmers-take-to-address-their-concerns>What steps did farmers take to address their concerns?</h2>
<p>What steps did farmers take to address their concerns? Many farmers joined together to push for reform. In 1867, a farmer named Oliver Hudson Kelley started an organization that became known as Grange. Grange gave rise to other organizations such as the Farmers’ Alliances.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-farmers-settle-on-the-great-plains>Why did farmers settle on the Great Plains?</h2>
<p>There were many problems farmers faced when they went to settle on the Great Plains. One of the problems was the land. The soil was much more difficult to farm in the Great Plains.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-weather-like-on-the-great-plains-in-the-1800s>What was the weather like on the Great Plains in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>Winters could be very cold and snowy while summers could be incredibly hot and humid. These factors made farming very difficult at times. There were many problems faced by farmers on the Great Plains during the 1800s.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-weather-affect-the-pioneers-on-the-plains>How did the weather affect the pioneers on the plains?</h2>
<p>Such storms damaged the pioneers home and equipment very badly. Until they could grow big enough trees, the pioneers couldn’t protect themselves well enough against the weather on the plains. The storm just had to pass while they were in the sod house hoping that the crops would not be destroyed.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-problems-did-the-pioneers-face>What kind of problems did the pioneers face?</h2>
<p>The long hot summers left the Prairie grass and the crops extremely dry causing fires. Unless the fire could be stopped quickly, it spreaded fast. Some pioneers tried to stop fires from spreading by leaving gaps in their crops. However. The high winds of the Plains spread the fire quickly. Even across gaps. This remained as a major problem.</p>
