<h2 id=what-contributed-to-the-growth-of-cattle-ranching>What contributed to the growth of cattle ranching?</h2>
<p>The cattle industry in the United States in the nineteenth century due to the young nation’s abundant land, wide-open spaces, and rapid development of railroad lines to transport the beef from western ranches to population centers in the Midwest and the East Coast.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-cattle-ranching-develop>How did cattle ranching develop?</h2>
<p>Ranching first started in Texas, with ranches mostly manned by Mexican cowboys called vaqueros. In 1836 Texan ranchers drove many Mexicans out, and claimed the cattle left behind. The Civil War started in 1861, and Texans went off to fight. The cattle roamed free as huge herds grew up.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-cattle-ranching-successful-in-texas>Why was cattle ranching successful in Texas?</h2>
<p>Although the missions were abandoned, Spanish cattle were introduced to the East Texas region, marking the beginning of a lasting cattle ranching industry. The Spanish cattle were the natural resource that helped the Texas economy recover faster than the rest of the South, ushering in the Texas cattle drive era.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-cattle-industry-grow-in-the-great-plains>Why did the cattle industry grow in the Great Plains?</h2>
<p>After the Civil War and the construction of railroads, many Americans began building large cattle ranches on the Great Plains. The Texas longhorn was a breed of cattle that could survive the harsh climate of the plains. Cattle raisers could graze their herds free of charge and without boundaries.</p>
<h2 id=what-ended-the-cattle-boom>What ended the cattle boom?</h2>
<p>By the 1880s, the cattle boom was over. The romantic era of the long drive and the cowboy came to an end when two harsh winters in 1885-1886 and 1886-1887, followed by two dry summers, killed 80 to 90 percent of the cattle on the Plains. As a result, corporate-owned ranches replaced individually owned ranches.</p>
<h2 id=do-cows-destroy-land>Do cows destroy land?</h2>
<p>ECOLOGICAL COSTS. Cattle destroy native vegetation, damage soils and stream banks, disrupt natural processes, and contaminate waterways with fecal waste.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-ranching-originate-in-the-united-states>How did ranching originate in the United States?</h2>
<p>In Northern Mexico, wealthy ranchers known as caballeros employed vaqueros to drive their cattle. Ranching in the western United States is derived from vaquero culture. Throughout most of the 1800s, ranchers in the United States set their cattle and sheep loose to roam the prairie. Most of the grazing land was owned by the government.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-cattle-come-to-the-united-states>How did cattle come to the United States?</h2>
<p>Cattle, just like horses, were first brought to America by the European invaders. By the 1850s, southern Texas was the major centre for cattle farming. The Texas longhorns were a breed that had developed from the original Spanish imports. They were very hardy and could survive on the open range in Texas.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cattle-industry-in-the-1850s>What was the cattle industry in the 1850’s?</h2>
<p>By the 1850’s, Texas was the centre of America’s cattle industry. Beef had become a popular food and cattle ranchers were becoming very rich. Most cattle-ranchers rode horses, and were known as cowboys. In order to sell their cattle, Texan cowboys had to transport their cattle to the markets in the eastern states.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-cattle-ranching-bad-for-the-environment>How is cattle ranching bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>Cattle have heavy, flat hooves that flatten the soil and reduce its ability to absorb water and nutrients. Drylands are especially at risk for overgrazing and reduction in the quality of soil. In fact, ranching can be a key cause of desertification. Livestock ranching also contributes to air and water pollution.</p>
