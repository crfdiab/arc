<h2 id=why-are-the-season-in-australia-and-asia-opposite>Why are the season in Australia and Asia opposite?</h2>
<p>The seasons are opposite because only one hemisphere can be tilted towards the sun at any given point. Whilst one hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, the other hemisphere is less exposed to sunlight. This means that one hemisphere will be in summer and the other will be in winter.</p>
<h2 id=why-there-is-summer-in-australia-when-there-is-winter-in-nepal>Why there is summer in Australia when there is winter in Nepal?</h2>
<p>Because Australia is in the opposite hemisphere to Europe/the US, winter up top means that we have longer days with sunlight having to penetrating the air at a deeper angle, so we are in the middle of summer. When it is winter down here, it is still quite warm because we are fairly close to the Equator.</p>
<h2 id=is-australias-weather-opposite>Is Australia’s weather opposite?</h2>
<p>Australia’s seasons are at opposite times to those in the northern hemisphere. December to February is summer; March to May is autumn; June to August is winter; and September to November is spring. Plan ahead with this information on weather and rainfall in Australia’s capital cities.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-climatic-condition-of-australia-like>What is the climatic condition of Australia like?</h2>
<p>Our summers tend to be warm and dry, with temperatures ranging from 25 to 35 degrees, while our winters tend to be cool and wet with temperatures ranging from 10 to 15 degrees Celsius.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-australia-a-developed-country>Why is Australia a developed country?</h2>
<p>Economic strength Australia’s economy has had more than two decades of growth due to demand for its natural resources. The nation also managed to sidestep the worst of the financial crisis and was the only major developed nation to avoid the global recession in 2009. Australia is also facing a widening income gap.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-australia-have-a-different-climate-to-the-northern-hemisphere>Why does Australia have a different climate to the northern hemisphere?</h2>
<p>Australia Due to the huge size of the country, Australia has serveral different climate zones. The seasons are the opposite of those in the Northern Hemisphere-when it’s summer in the north, it’s winter south of the equator.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-weather-like-in-the-south-of-nepal>What’s the weather like in the south of Nepal?</h2>
<p>In northern Nepal summers are cool and winters are severe, while in the south summers are very hot while winters are mild to cold.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-life-expectancy-in-nepal-compared-to-australia>How is the life expectancy in Nepal compared to Australia?</h2>
<p>The life expectancy at birth in Nepal is 67.19 while in Australia it is 82.07. This entry contains the average number of years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in the future.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-rainier-the-east-or-the-west-in-nepal>Which is Rainier the east or the west in Nepal?</h2>
<p>On the southern slopes, at equal altitude, the east is rainier than the west. In the thin southern plain, a region known as Terai, the climate is that of the Indo-Gangetic plain, which is also found in northern India.</p>
