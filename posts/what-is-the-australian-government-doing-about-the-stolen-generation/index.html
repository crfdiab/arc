<h2 id=what-is-the-australian-government-doing-about-the-stolen-generation>What is the Australian government doing about the Stolen Generation?</h2>
<p>Since 2007, the Australian Government has provided: $15.7 million (2007–08) over four years for additional • resources and support to enable additional reunions of Stolen Generations’ members with their families through Link-Up Services and also to fund an extra 20 Bringing Them Home Counsellors.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-done-to-stop-the-stolen-generation>What was done to stop the stolen generation?</h2>
<p>The NSW Aborigines Protection Board loses its power to remove Indigenous children. The Board is renamed the Aborigines Welfare Board and is finally abolished in 1969.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-stolen-generation-stopped>Why was the stolen generation stopped?</h2>
<p>Efforts to make stolen children reject their culture often created a sense of shame about being of Indigenous heritage. This resulted in a disconnection from culture, and an inability to pass culture on to their children. Many children were wrongly told that their parents were abusive, had died or had abandoned them.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-mean-by-the-stolen-generation>What do you mean by the Stolen Generation?</h2>
<p>On this page… The phrase Stolen Generation refers to the countless number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who were forcibly removed from their families under government policy and direction.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-national-apology-to-the-stolen-generations>What was the national apology to the Stolen Generations?</h2>
<p>The national Apology to the Stolen Generations acknowledged the trauma and grief suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as a result of past government policies, particularly the removal of children from their families.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-children-were-removed-from-their-families-during-the-stolen-generation>How many children were removed from their families during the Stolen Generation?</h2>
<p>It is estimated that during the active period of the policy, between 1 in 10 and 1 in 3 Indigenous children were removed from their families and communities. The removal of Indigenous children was rationalised by various governments by claiming that it was for their protection and would save them from a life of neglect.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-new-south-wales-start-the-stolen-generations>When did New South Wales start the Stolen Generations?</h2>
<p>The terms ‘Stolen Generations’ is also by no means new. New South Wales Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs in 1981. Wales Government had good cause to address the issue. In New South Wales, “neglected”. the best interest of the child’s welfare. No court hearings were necessary in a town might simply order them to be removed.</p>
