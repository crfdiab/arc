<h2 id=how-did-jamestown-settlers-get-water>How did Jamestown settlers get water?</h2>
<p>High tide brings saline water in from the Chesapeake Bay. Even at low tide, the salt content of the water is too great for drinking. The settlers dug wells, but they never dug them deep enough nor in the proper location. As a result, their wastes contaminated much of their drinking water.</p>
<h2 id=did-jamestown-have-clean-drinking-water>Did Jamestown have clean drinking water?</h2>
<p>Geologists at William & Mary are analyzing a possible contributing cause of the deaths at Jamestown Island during the Starving Time of 1609 and 1610—bad drinking water. The scientists are finding that the Jamestown aquifer water contains high, but varying, levels of arsenic.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-wrong-with-the-water-at-jamestown>What was wrong with the water at Jamestown?</h2>
<p>Further, the water supply at Jamestown was contaminated both by human wastes and seawater. Moreover, by autumn it became obvious that the colonists had insufficient food to get them through the winter. Not enough land had been cleared and not enough crops had been planted and harvested.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-they-drink-in-jamestown>What did they drink in Jamestown?</h2>
<p>Beer, cider and other relatively weak fermented beverages were almost universally consumed from the earliest days of Virginia’s history.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-common-disease-in-jamestown>What was the most common disease in Jamestown?</h2>
<p>As the winter wore on, scores of Jamestown’s inhabitants suffered from diseases associated with malnutrition and contamination, including dysentery, typhoid and scurvy. By the time Lord De La Warr showed up with supplies in June 1610, the settlers, reduced in number from several hundred to 60, were trying to flee.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-jamestown-colonists-get-their-water>How did the Jamestown colonists get their water?</h2>
<p>“Jamestown Island is in a zone of the river that during certain times of the year is surrounded by saltwater,” Whittenburg explained. “It’s like a sewer that never gets flushed. The colonists are drawing water out of the same place where human and animal waste are being deposited.”</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-drought-affect-the-jamestown-settlement>How did the drought affect the Jamestown Settlement?</h2>
<p>This drought contributed to poor water quality and difficult growing seasons. Although the Jamestown settlers had been instructed to try farming on a small scale, the sandy soil did not hold moisture well and the drought killed what crops they did manage to plant.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-first-settlement-in-jamestown>What was the name of the first settlement in Jamestown?</h2>
<p>Today it includes a recreation of the original James Fort (c. 1607 to 1614), a Powhatan Native American Town, indoor and outdoor displays, and replicas of the original settlers’ ships the Susan Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-captain-newport-leave-the-jamestown-settlement>Why did Captain Newport leave the Jamestown Settlement?</h2>
<p>On June 22, Captain Newport left for England to get more supplies for the new settlement. Not long after Captain Newport left, the settlers began to succumb to a variety of diseases. They were drinking water from the salty or slimy river, which was one of several things that caused the death of many. The death tolls were high.</p>
