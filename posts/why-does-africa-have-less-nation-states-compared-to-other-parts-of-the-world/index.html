<h2 id=why-does-africa-have-less-nation-states-compared-to-other-parts-of-the-world>Why does Africa have less nation-states compared to other parts of the world?</h2>
<p>Why does Africa have less nation-states compared to other parts of the world? This is because of colonialism and the Scramble for Africa. Africa also has such a large variety of different ethnic groups that live in a small geographic area that it would be hard to have a nation-state for each ethnic group.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-nations-states-are-in-africa>How many nations states are in Africa?</h2>
<p>54 countries<br>
There are 54 countries in Africa today, according to the United Nations….Countries in Africa:</p>
<table><tr><th>\#</th><td>52</td></tr><tr><th>Country</th><td>Cabo Verde</td></tr><tr><th>Population (2020)</th><td>555,987</td></tr><tr><th>Subregion</th><td>Western Africa</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-stateless-nations>Why are there so many stateless nations?</h2>
<p>According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), “statelessness can occur for several reasons, including discrimination against particular ethnic or religious groups, or on the basis of gender; the emergence of new states and transfers of territory between existing states; and gaps in nationality …</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-no-nation>Which country has no nation?</h2>
<p>Examples of stateless nations: The Kurds currently reside in Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey, but they have not established an internationally-recognized state based on their national identity.</p>

<li>Burkina Faso.</li>
<li>Cabo Verde.</li>
<li>Central African Republic.</li>
<li>Chad.</li>
<li>Comoros.</li>
<li>Congo.
Is there a state without nation?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>A nation can exist without a state, as is exemplified by the stateless nations. Throughout history, numerous nations declared their independence, but not all succeeded in establishing a state. Even today, there are active autonomy and independence movements around the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-nation-state-wrong-for-africa>Why is the nation-state wrong for Africa?</h2>
<p>The inherited model of the nation-state in Africa (and its derivative nationalism) caused the destruction of minority consciousness in post-colonialism and has had far reaching repercussions of identity fragmentation in modernity. [5]</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-nation-state-in-africa>When was the first nation state in Africa?</h2>
<p>Dependency. Failed States. Nearly 60 years since the first African countries declared independence (Sudan 1956, followed by Ghana 1958), the continent continues on many fronts to be in a state of arrested development.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-the-state-and-the-nation>What’s the difference between the state and the nation?</h2>
<p>This is an inheritance that is often overlooked as a norm and that is taken for granted as the natural and certain structure of governance: The nation-state. While the state is symbolic of the physical structure and institutions of governance, the nation is something far less tangible.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-some-countries-in-africa-not-industrializing>Why are some countries in Africa not industrializing?</h2>
<p>Adeyemi Dipeolu, an economic adviser to Nigeria’s Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, shares this view. He told participants at the report launch in Addis Ababa that African policymakers are “hesitant to take alternative policies for fear of dictates and conditionalities of the West.” Yet The Economist sees things differently.</p>
