<h2 id=how-many-deaths-has-mauna-loa-caused>How many deaths has Mauna Loa caused?</h2>
<p>The eruption of Mauna Loa in the spring of 1868 and the deadly phenomena surrounding it were one of the greatest natural disasters in Hawaiian history. 77 Hawaiians died in the associated tsunami and landslides. As with most eruptions of Mauna Loa, the 1868 eruption began at its summit caldera, Moku’āweoweo.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-damage-did-the-mauna-loa-cause-in-1984>How much damage did the Mauna Loa cause in 1984?</h2>
<p>Scientists use the The Richter scale for measuring eruptions and the most recent eruption in 1984. It was a 6.0 and the damage costed about 2.300,000,000 dollars. That is a lot of money too.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-when-the-mauna-loa-erupted-in-1984>What happened when the Mauna Loa erupted in 1984?</h2>
<p>Lava fountains feed voluminous lava flows from 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa. Lava channel blockage caused an overflow of the main lava channel leading from the “2,900-m vents” of the 1984 Mauna Loa eruption. Lava spills over the collapsed side levee to feed new flows.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-mauna-loa-last-erupt-and-how-many-people-died>When did Mauna Loa last erupt and how many people died?</h2>
<p>Mauna Loa’s most recent eruption occurred from March 24 to April 15, 1984. No recent eruptions of the volcano have caused fatalities, but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages, and the city of Hilo is partly built on lava flows from the late 19th century.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-eruption-of-mauna-loa-in-1984>How big was the eruption of Mauna Loa in 1984?</h2>
<p>Its output of lava has averaged about 400,000 cubic metres (14 million cubic feet) per day, in sharp contrast to the 12 million cubic metres (424 million cubic feet) per day during the first week of the 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa. It is this slow but steady effusion of molten lava that has allowed the eruption of Kilauea to continue so long.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-eruption-of-mauna-loa-affect-kilauea>How did the eruption of Mauna Loa affect Kilauea?</h2>
<p>Structure. This is not always the case; the 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa started during an eruption at Kīlauea, but had no discernible effect on the Kīlauea eruption, and the ongoing inflation of Mauna Loa’s summit, indicative of a future eruption, began the same day as new lava flows at Kīlauea’s Puʻu ʻŌʻō crater.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-the-mauna-loa-volcano-erupt>How often does the Mauna Loa volcano erupt?</h2>
<p>On average, Mauna Loa, located on the island of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean, erupts every three and a half years with fountains and streams of incandescent lava. Following a year of increased seismicity, Mauna Loa began erupting at 1:25 am on March 25, 1984.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-mauna-loa-was-inactive>When was the last time Mauna Loa was inactive?</h2>
<p>Although not counting the minor activity in 1975, Mauna Loa was inactive for a 34 year period between 1950 and 1984. Its recent inactivity is most likely not long-term, as even a century of low activity is a very short period in Mauna Loa’s several hundred-thousand year history.</p>
