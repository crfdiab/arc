<p>All or parts of 15 Western states would eventually be carved from its nearly 830,000 square miles, which stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada, and from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains. And the price, $15 million, or about four cents an acre, was a breathtaking bargain.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-louisiana-purchase-territory>How big was the Louisiana Purchase territory?</h2>
<p>approximately 827,000 square miles<br>
The Louisiana Purchase (1803) was a land deal between the United States and France, in which the U.S. acquired approximately 827,000 square miles of land west of the Mississippi River for $15 million.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-did-the-purchase-of-the-louisiana-territory-increase-the-size-of-the-united-states>How much did the purchase of the Louisiana Territory increase the size of the United States?</h2>
<p>In late April 1803, with the stroke of a pen and the exchange of just $15 million, the United States nearly doubled in size. With the Louisiana Purchase, the U.S. acquired nearly 827,000 square miles of French-held land for just four cents an acre.</p>

<p>Since 1762, Spain had owned the territory of Louisiana, which included 828,000 square miles, and which now makes up all or part of fifteen separate states between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-louisiana-become-part-of-the-united-states>When did Louisiana become part of the United States?</h2>
<p>On April 30, 1812, exactly nine years after the Louisiana Purchase agreement was made, the first state to be carved from the territory – Louisiana – was admitted into the Union as the 18th U.S. state.

<h2 id=what-was-the-problem-with-the-louisiana-purchase>What was the problem with the Louisiana Purchase?</h2>
<p>The trouble with the textbook version of the Louisiana Purchase lies with its easy reduction to a real estate transaction. Europeans had only colonized a tiny fraction of the territory by 1803. Over those areas where they had established control, France sold the United States the right to tax and govern.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-acquire-the-right-to-buy-land>How did the US acquire the right to buy land?</h2>
<p>In these sections of the purchase, the U.S. acquired the exclusive right to invade or negotiate with indigenous inhabitants for control of their land: to take it by force or buy it by contract.</p>
