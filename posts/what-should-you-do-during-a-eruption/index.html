<h2 id=what-should-you-do-during-a-eruption>What should you do during a eruption?</h2>
<p>Use goggles and wear eyeglasses instead of contact lenses. Use a dust mask or hold a damp cloth over your face to help with breathing. Stay away from areas downwind from the volcano to avoid volcanic ash. Stay indoors until the ash has settled unless there is a danger of the roof collapsing.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-people-during-a-volcanic-eruption>What happens to people during a volcanic eruption?</h2>
<p>Health concerns after a volcanic eruption include infectious disease, respiratory illness, burns, injuries from falls, and vehicle accidents related to the slippery, hazy conditions caused by ash. When warnings are heeded, the chances of adverse health effects from a volcanic eruption are very low.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-survive-a-volcanic-eruption>How do you survive a volcanic eruption?</h2>
<p>Breathe through a respirator, mask, or moist piece of cloth—this will also protect your lungs from clouds of ash—and try to get away from the volcano as quickly as possible. Do not stay low to the ground, as some of the most dangerous gases are heavier than air and accumulate near the ground. Protect your eyes as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-if-volcano-erupts-near-you>What to do if volcano erupts near you?</h2>
<p>IF YOU ARE UNDER A VOLCANO WARNING:</p>
<ol>
<li>Listen for emergency information and alerts.</li>
<li>Follow evacuation or shelter orders.</li>
<li>Avoid areas downstream of the eruption.</li>
<li>Protect yourself from falling ash.</li>
<li>Do not drive in heavy ash fall.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-can-survive-lava>What can survive lava?</h2>
<p>Since lava is typically around 2200 F, Platinum and Titanium would both be fine since they both have melting temperatures above 3000 F. Also, some ceramics could probably withstand these temperatures.</p>
<h2 id=can-volcano-kill-you>Can volcano kill you?</h2>
<p>Most people killed by volcanoes are the victims of pyroclastic flows and lahars – volcanic mudflows, packed with debris – which have been responsible for about 120,000 deaths over the last 500 years. Pyroclastic flows are very fast avalanches of rock, ash and gas, which can reach temperatures of 700C.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-volcano-eruption-kill-you>Can a volcano eruption kill you?</h2>
<p>Volcanic eruptions can be highly explosive. Some volcanoes have undergone catastrophic eruptions, killing large numbers of humans or other life forms.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-you-do-if-you-are-caught-in-a-volcanic-eruption>What should you do if you are caught in a volcanic eruption?</h2>
<p>If caught in volcanic ashfalls, wear a dust mask or use a handkerchief or cloth over your nose and mouth. Stay indoors as volcanic ash is a health hazard, especially if you have respiratory difficulties such as asthma or bronchitis. When indoors, close all windows and doors to limit the entry of volcanic ash.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-a-volcanic-eruption>What are the effects of a volcanic eruption?</h2>
<p>Volcanic eruptions can be catastrophic in some cases. The immediate area is usually evacuated quickly to keep people safe. Extremely hot lava can also cause lots of damage, burning through towns and farmland. The ash from a volcano can also cause breathing problems, and create travel disruptions, as it lowers the visibility for pilots.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-you-wear-during-a-volcanic-eruption>What should you wear during a volcanic eruption?</h2>
<p>Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Use goggles to protect your eyes.If ash is continually falling, you may not be able to shelter indoors for more than a few hours, because the weight of the ash could collapse the roof of your building and block air intakes into the building.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-a-volcano-to-erupt>How long does it take for a volcano to erupt?</h2>
<p>Volcanic unrest and eruptions will be reported to the public through the Volcano Hazards Program websites and by the media. Volcanic unrest is defined as the period of time when a volcano is showing unusual activity or is erupting. Unrest may last for months to years.</p>
