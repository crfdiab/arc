<h2 id=where-are-the-rocky-mountains-in-the-west-region>Where are the Rocky Mountains in the West Region?</h2>
<p>The most prominent feature of the region are the Rocky Mountains, which stretch from the northern area of British Columbia through Alberta, Montana, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico. Mount Elbert is the highest peak of the mountain range at 14,440 feet in Colorado.</p>

<p>Igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. The Rocky Mountains, also known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than 4,800 kilometers (3,000 mi) from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico in the Southwestern United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-geology-of-the-rocky-mountains>What is the geology of the Rocky Mountains?</h2>
<p>The geology of the Rocky Mountains is that of a discontinuous series of mountain ranges with distinct geological origins. Collectively these make up the Rocky Mountains, a mountain system that stretches from Northern British Columbia through central New Mexico and which is part of the great mountain system known as the North American Cordillera .</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-ranges-of-the-rockies-located>Where are the ranges of the Rockies located?</h2>
<p>Some of the individual ranges include the Front Range and San Juan Mountains of Colorado. The Uintas in Utah are in the Central Rockies. The Central Rockies include the ranges in north-eastern Utah, western and northern Wyoming and the south-eastern corner of Idaho.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-mountains-that-are-not-part-of-the-rockies>Are there any mountains that are not part of the Rockies?</h2>
<p>The Rockies do not extend into the Yukon or Alaska, or into central British Columbia. Other mountain ranges continue beyond the Liard River, including the Selwyn Mountains in Yukon, the Brooks Range in Alaska, but those are not part of the Rockies, though they are part of the American Cordillera.</p>
