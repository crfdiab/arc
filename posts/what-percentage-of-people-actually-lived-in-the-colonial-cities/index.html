<h2 id=what-percentage-of-people-actually-lived-in-the-colonial-cities>What percentage of people actually lived in the colonial cities?</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that fewer than 10 percent of all colonials lived in cities, cities set the tone for commerce, politics, and culture, serving as religious, economic and cultural centers.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-the-colonial-population-was-english>What percentage of the colonial population was English?</h2>
<p>The Colonial Population By 1776, about 85% of the white population in the British colonies was of English, Irish, Scottish, or Welsh descent, with 9% of German origin and 4% Dutch.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-the-colonists>What was the population of the colonists?</h2>
<p>The colonial population grew from about 2,000 to 2.4 million between 1625 and 1775, displacing Native Americans. This population included people subject to a system of slavery which was legal in all of the colonies prior to the American Revolutionary War.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-the-colonies-during-the-colonial-period>What was the population of the colonies during the colonial period?</h2>
<p>Enumerations of population, more or less accurate, were made in nearly all the Northern colonies during the Colonial period, and several of the states took one or more censuses during the Continental period.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-city-in-the-colonies>Which is the largest city in the colonies?</h2>
<p>The Colonies: 1720-1763 2. Only five percent of the British Atlantic population of the 1700s lived in cities—the five largest being Boston, New York, Newport [RI], Philadelphia, and Charles Town [Charleston]—and none had more than 40,000 people in 1775. 1 So why devote a section on these coastal commercial centers?</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-census-procedure-in-the-colonial-period>What was the census procedure in the colonial period?</h2>
<p>CENSUS PROCEDURE IN COLONIAL AND CONTINENTAL PERIODS-POPU­ LATION PRIOR TO 1790-RECENT ESTIMATES OF EARLY POPULATION­ POPULATION OF CITIES-CHANGES IN URBAN POPULATION 1710 TO 1900.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-port-city-important-to-the-colonies>Why was the port city important to the colonies?</h2>
<p>As commercial thoroughfares, they were central markets for colonies’ crops, ores, and other output, and they stimulated the colonial “industry” of artisans and craftsmen. Finally, each port city was a center of the colony’s political, social, religious, and intellectual life.</p>
