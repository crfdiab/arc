<p>Moon takes about 29 days to rotation once on its axis.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-time-does-the-moon-take-to-complete-one-rotation-around-the-earth>How much time does the moon take to complete one rotation around the Earth?</h2>
<p>Knowing how this dance between the Moon, Earth and Sun plays out lets us understand the Moon’s constantly changing appearance. Moon fact: The Moon’s phases repeat every 29.5 days, but it’s orbit around the Earth only takes 27.</p>
<h2 id=in-what-direction-is-the-earth-rotating>In what direction is the earth rotating?</h2>
<p>Its rotation direction is prograde, or west to east, which appears counterclockwise when viewed from above the North Pole, and it is common to all the planets in our solar system except Venus and Uranus, according to NASA.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-the-moon-to-rotate-around-the-earth>How long does it take for the Moon to rotate around the Earth?</h2>
<p>The quick answer is that a lunar day, from sunrise to sunrise, takes about 29 earth days – a period roughly equal to the time for the moon to make one circuit of its orbit around the earth. This results in a situation where, to an earthly observer, the moon doesn’t seem to be rotating about its axis at all.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-moon-never-rotate-on-its-axis>Why does the Moon never rotate on its axis?</h2>
<p>This is also the amount of time it takes for the moon to complete its orbit around the Earth. Due to the fact that the moon’s rotational period and orbital period are both about 28 days, it deceivingly appears that the moon never rotates. This is the result of the Earth’s gravity creating “tidal…</p>

<p>A complete rotation of the earth on its axis takes approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes and four seconds with respect to the background stars. However, the sun returns to the same place in the sky (correcting for seasonal differences) every 24 hours.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-moon-day-and-night-at-the-same-time>How is the moon day and night at the same time?</h2>
<p>A: The Moon has no side that is constantly dark. As the Moon rotates, different parts of its surface experience day and night. During a full Moon, it is daytime on the side of the Moon that faces Earth (also called the “near side”). During a new Moon, it is night on the near side, and day on the far side.</p>
