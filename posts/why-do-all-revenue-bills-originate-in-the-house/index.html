<h2 id=why-do-all-revenue-bills-originate-in-the-house>Why do all revenue bills originate in the House?</h2>
<p>The provision was part of a compromise between the large and small states. Smaller states, which would be over-represented in the Senate, would concede the power to originate money bills to the House, where states with larger populations would have greater control.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-bills-for-raising-revenue>What are bills for raising revenue?</h2>
<p>Only bills to levy taxes in the strict sense of the word are comprehended by the phrase “all bills for raising revenue”; bills for other purposes, which incidentally create revenue, are not included.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-bills-originate-in-congress>Where do bills originate in Congress?</h2>
<p>Bills may originate in either the House of Representatives or the Senate with one notable exception. Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution provides that all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives but that the Senate may propose, or concur with, amendments.</p>
<h2 id=do-spending-bills-originate-in-the-house>Do spending bills originate in the House?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, appropriation bills originate in the House of Representatives. In reference to revenue bills, the Constitution also states that the “Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.” As with revenue bills, the Senate and House each drafts and considers its own appropriation bill.</p>
<h2 id=in-what-house-do-all-revenue-bills-start>In what House do all revenue bills start?</h2>
<p>the House of Representatives<br>
All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-house-have-power-of-the-purse>Why does the House have power of the purse?</h2>
<p>The Constitution gave the power of the purse – the nation’s checkbook – to Congress. The Founders believed that this separation of powers would protect against monarchy and provide an important check on the executive branch.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-president-have-power-of-the-purse>Does the President have power of the purse?</h2>
<p>The power of the purse plays a critical role in the relationship of the United States Congress and the President of the United States, and has been the main historic tool by which Congress has limited executive power.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-a-bill-for-raising-revenue-originate>Where does a bill for raising revenue originate?</h2>
<p>All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills. The federal Constitution was written in 1787 and adopted in 1789.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-a-property-tax-bill-to-increase>What causes a property tax bill to increase?</h2>
<p>Property tax bills can increase for a variety of reasons. Your local, state or federal government laws may change, causing property taxes to spike.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-majority-of-federal-tax-revenue-come-from>Where does the majority of federal tax revenue come from?</h2>
<p>Income taxes paid by individuals: $1.48 trillion, or 47% of all tax revenues. Payroll taxes paid jointly by workers and employers: $1.07 trillion, 34% of all tax revenues. Corporate income taxes paid by businesses: $341.7 billion, or 11% of all tax revenues.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-constitution-say-about-tax-bills>What does the constitution say about tax bills?</h2>
<p>The Constitution says that “all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives” and that “Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes.”. Presidents can, and frequently do, recommend changes to current tax laws, but only Congress can make the changes.</p>
