<p>The Orinoco flows in a giant arc for more than 2,736 kilometers (1,700 miles), originating in the Guiana Highlands of northern Brazil and discharging in the Atlantic Ocean in Venezuela.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-major-river-in-the-northern-portion-of-south-america>What is the major river in the northern portion of South America?</h2>
<p>The Amazon River<br>
The Amazon River is located in the northern portion of South America, flowing from west to east. The river system originates in the Andes Mountains of Peru and travels through Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazil before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-mountains-in-the-western-portion-of-south-america-runs-roughly-parallel-to-the-pacific-coast-for-more-than-5000-miles>What mountains in the western portion of South America runs roughly parallel to the Pacific coast for more than 5000 miles?</h2>
<p>Andes Mts. Mountains in the western portion of South America that run roughly parallel to the Pacific Coast for more than 5,000 miles.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-most-of-the-rivers-of-south-america-flow-east-to-the-atlantic-ocean>Why do most of the rivers of South America flow east to the Atlantic Ocean?</h2>
<p>Over time, South America developed a vertical crease along its middle, a small mountain range called the Purus Arch. The ridge divided the Amazon’s flow [image], sending one side of the river eastward toward the Atlantic Ocean and the other side westward toward the still-growing Andes Mountains.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-lake-in-south-america>Which is the largest lake in South America?</h2>
<p>Lago Argentino is a lake in Los Glaciares National Park, Argentina. It is the largest freshwater lake in the country and the fourth largest lake on the continent. The lake covers an area of 546 sq mi with an average depth of 1,640 ft. The primary inflows are La Leona River and several streams of melting glaciers.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-permanent-lakes-in-south-america>Are there any permanent lakes in South America?</h2>
<p>There are eight lakes in South America most of which are located on the Andes or foothills. The continent’s complex topography has lead to the accumulation of water in closed basins forming reservoirs. Permanent Andean lakes in the continent are Lake Titicaca, Lake Sarococha, Lake Junín, and Lake Poopó.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-lakes-in-south-america-shrinking>Why are the lakes in South America shrinking?</h2>
<p>Threats to the Lakes of South America. The lakes of the continent depend on the glaciers for water. The Andes provides a significant amount of the water. Since the late 1990s, the size of the lakes and the volume of the water have been shrinking as glacials that provided water has completely melted away or shrank significantly.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-highest-navigable-lake-in-the-world>Which is the highest navigable lake in the world?</h2>
<p>It is the world’s “highest navigable lake” at an altitude of 12,507 ft. Titicaca is located within the boundaries of two countries; the western part lies in Puno Region of Peru while the eastern part is located in the Bolivian La Paz Department. The lake consists of two basins connected by the Strait of Tiquina.</p>
