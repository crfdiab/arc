<h2 id=how-is-canada-a-representative-democracy>How is Canada a representative democracy?</h2>
<p>Canada is a representative democracy. That means that citizens elect representatives to the House of Commons who, along with the Senate, then make laws and decisions for the country and its people. Some aspects of our system are based on unwritten traditions, while other procedures are written in our Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-difference-between-direct-and-indirect-democracy>What is difference between direct and indirect democracy?</h2>
<p>Indirect democracy, or representative democracy, is when citizens elect representatives to make laws for them. This is what most modern countries have today. Direct democracy is where citizens themselves vote for or against specific proposals or laws.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-difference-between-direct-and-indirect-election>What is difference between direct and indirect election?</h2>
<p>Direct election is a system of choosing political officeholders in which the voters directly cast ballots for the persons or political party that they desire to see elected. By contrast, in an indirect election, the voters elect a body which in turn elects the officeholder in question.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-indirect-democracy>Which country has indirect democracy?</h2>
<p>Four countries having indirect democracy are India, the USA, Canada and the UK.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-democracy-in-canada>Which is an example of a democracy in Canada?</h2>
<p>This represents a strong standing within its democratic structure and governance. In a nut shell, Canada is an independent constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy where the government is steered by a parliamentary system which consists of elected members of parliament.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-government-do-they-have-in-canada>What kind of government do they have in Canada?</h2>
<p>In a nut shell, Canada is an independent constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy where the government is steered by a parliamentary system which consists of elected members of parliament. Canada also has a number of political parties and the government is headed by a Prime Minister.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-a-lack-of-democracy-in-canada>Why is there a lack of democracy in Canada?</h2>
<p>This proves that there is a deficiency of knowledge and information among Canadians who are misconstrued by the government’s opinion poll. Thus, most of them do not understand and are ignorant on the mechanisms within which the government operates in the tenets of economic and political systems.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-first-minister-of-canada-in-a-democracy>Who is the First Minister of Canada in a democracy?</h2>
<p>In a democracy, legislatures are also to be representative of the governed. They may be wise or not, and consistent or not, depending on the general wishes of the voters, but they must at least be representative. Canadian legislatures often fail this test because one person, the first minister, normally dominates them.</p>
