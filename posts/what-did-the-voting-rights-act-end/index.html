<h2 id=what-did-the-voting-rights-act-end>What did the voting rights act end?</h2>
<p>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a landmark piece of federal legislation in the United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-voting-rights-act-of-1965-stop-discrimination>How did the voting rights Act of 1965 stop discrimination?</h2>
<p>The legislation outlawed literacy tests and provided for the appointment of Federal examiners (with the power to register qualified citizens to vote) in certain jurisdictions with a history of voting discrimination.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-the-voting-rights-act-last>How long did the voting rights Act last?</h2>
<p>Originally set to expire after 10 years, Congress reauthorized Section 203 in 1982 for seven years, expanded and reauthorized it in 1992 for 15 years, and reauthorized it in 2006 for 25 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-civil-rights-movement-affect-america>How did the civil rights movement affect America?</h2>
<p>One of the greatest achievements of the civil rights movement, the Civil Rights Act led to greater social and economic mobility for African-Americans across the nation and banned racial discrimination, providing greater access to resources for women, religious minorities, African-Americans and low-income families.</p>
<h2 id=who-voted-for-the-civil-rights-act>Who voted for the Civil Rights Act?</h2>
<p>Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law on August 6, 1965, with Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders present at the ceremony.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-african-american-to-be-elected-to-the-us-senate>Who was the first African American to be elected to the US Senate?</h2>
<p>The Reconstruction era was noteworthy in that African American men were not only granted voting rights but even won several seats in Congress. Hiram Revels and Blanche Bruce became the first African Americans to be elected to the U.S. Senate, representing the state of Mississippi.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-fight-for-african-american-suffrage>What was the fight for African American suffrage?</h2>
<p>The fight for African American suffrage raged on for decades. In the 1930s one Georgia man described the situation this way: “Do you know I’ve never voted in my life, never been able to exercise my right as a citizen because of the poll tax? I can’t pay a poll tax, can’t have a voice in my own government.”</p>
<h2 id=how-many-black-members-of-congress-were-there-in-1965>How many black members of Congress were there in 1965?</h2>
<p>In 1965, at the time of the passage of the Voting Rights Act, there were six African American members of the U.S. House of Representatives and no Black people in the U.S. Senate. By 1971, there were 13 members of the House and one Black member of the Senate.</p>
