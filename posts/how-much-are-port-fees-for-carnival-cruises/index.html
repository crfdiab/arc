<h2 id=how-much-are-port-fees-for-carnival-cruises>How much are port fees for Carnival Cruises?</h2>
<p>Price Protection applies to the cruise fare only and does not include Taxes, Fees and Port Expenses. Taxes, Fees and Port Expenses range from $63.14 to $427.14, and are assessed on a per guest basis for all guests according to the itinerary.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-are-taxes-and-port-fees-for-cruises>How much are taxes and port fees for cruises?</h2>
<p>While no cruise line will breakdown exactly how much of the fee is going toward what specific charge, the total costs for government fees and port charges are typically less than 20 percent of the base cruise fare — though they can be as high as 50 percent in some cases.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-port-charges-and-taxes>What are port charges and taxes?</h2>
<p>Cruise Taxes, Fees and Port Expenses may include U.S. Customs fees, head taxes, Panama Canal tolls, dockage fees, wharfage fees, inspection fees, pilotage, immigration and naturalization fees, and Internal Revenue Service fees, environmental fees, as well as fees associated with navigation, berthing, stevedoring.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-transfer-fees-on-a-cruise>What are transfer fees on a cruise?</h2>
<p>While these fees are not exhorbitant, they could make the cost of your cruise higher than expected. Airport transfer fees usually start at about $25 per person one way.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-bring-snacks-on-carnival-cruise>Can I bring snacks on Carnival cruise?</h2>
<p>Food and Drink You can bring food onto Carnival cruises, but it must be unopened, prepackaged and ready to eat. Don’t bring anything you whipped up at home — Carnival completely prohibits these items to prevent contamination.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-bring-a-12-pack-of-soda-on-carnival-cruise>Can I bring a 12 pack of soda on Carnival cruise?</h2>
<p>A small quantity is considered a maximum of 12 sealed, unopened cans/cartons of 12 ounces each or less, per person. Guests sailing with us on back-to-back cruises are entitled to bring the same quantity as stated in this policy, per cruise.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-avoid-extra-charges-on-a-cruise>How can I avoid extra charges on a cruise?</h2>
<p>Want to avoid paying a lot of extra charges on a cruise? One way to do it is to book a trip with a luxury line such as Regent Seven Seas Cruises, Silversea, Seabourn or Crystal Cruises. Luxury lines generally include almost everything in their base fares, from drinks of all kinds to gratuities.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-pay-for-water-on-a-cruise>Do you have to pay for water on a cruise?</h2>
<p>What you’ll pay: At meals, water, iced tea, milk, coffee, tea and juices are complimentary, but alcoholic beverages are not included in the cruise fare on most lines. Plus, many will also charge for soda, bottled water, certain juices and specialty coffees.</p>
<h2 id=what-taxes-do-cruise-lines-pay>What taxes do cruise lines pay?</h2>
<p>Further, cruise lines are subject to state income taxes, as well as various other taxes, such as a 33% tax on all gambling revenue generated while in Alaska waters. Additionally, more than 420,000 U.S.-based employees or people associated with cruise industry pay federal and state income taxes.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-pay-for-a-cruise-all-at-once>Do you pay for a cruise all at once?</h2>
<p>Do I need to pay for my cruise all at once? No, you do not. A typical deposit is in the range of $250 to $1,000, depending on length of cruise and cabin type. The rest of the payment is typically due one to three months before the sailing date, again depending on the length of the cruise and the cabin type.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-bring-a-12-pack-of-soda-on-carnival-cruise-1>Can I bring a 12 pack of soda on Carnival Cruise?</h2>
