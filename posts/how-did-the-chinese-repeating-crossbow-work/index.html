<h2 id=how-did-the-chinese-repeating-crossbow-work>How did the Chinese repeating crossbow work?</h2>
<p>The repeating crossbow combined the actions of spanning the bow, placing the bolt, and shooting into a one-handed movement, thus allowing for a much higher rate of fire than a normal crossbow. Instead of an overhand lever for arming and shooting, it used a sliding lever that had a handle tied to the end with chord.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-ancient-china-invent-the-crossbow>Why did ancient China invent the crossbow?</h2>
<p>However, over two thousand years ago in China, the crossbow was invented as an innovation to the basic bow and arrow that extended the use of mechanical hand weapons throughout the world. Arrowheads were first made of burnt wood, then stone or bone, and then metals.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-crossbow-so-important>Why was the crossbow so important?</h2>
<p>Crossbows were in use in China by the fifth century BCE and quickly became an important element in the warfare of the Warring States period. They became popular for the defense of royal entourages and for hunting; the later multiple-firing crossbows were intended for military campaigns.</p>
<h2 id=did-samurai-use-crossbows>Did Samurai use crossbows?</h2>
<p>First, it is fair to point out that unlike other unknown elements of ancient and feudal Japanese warfare, like shields, axes or maces which are usually not associated neither with Japan or the Samurai, the crossbow never saw much use at all.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-repeating-crossbow-still-used-today>Is the repeating crossbow still used today?</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most famous and long-lived of Chinese weapons, the repeating crossbow dates back from the 4th century B.C. Its basic design has remained relatively unchanged until it fell out of use around in the early 20th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-crossbow-did-the-ancient-chinese-use>What kind of crossbow did the ancient Chinese use?</h2>
<p>The Chinese crossbow ( nu) with its horizontal bow and short wooden stock fired single or multiple bronze -headed arrows. The arrows had wooden shafts and feathered, wooden or paper vanes for stability in their trajectory.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-crossbow-help-the-han-empire>How did the crossbow help the Han Empire?</h2>
<p>The crossbow was a major factor in the success of the Chinese states against foreign armies and in establishing the dominance of the Han and Sung empires, in particular.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-crossbow-change-the-art-of-warfare>How did the crossbow change the art of warfare?</h2>
<p>Use of this weapon required training from youth and large amounts of brute strength to pull back the 180-pound bow! All of that changed when the Chinese developed the magnificent crossbow. Through its simplicity and power it changed the art of warfare forever. Exactly when and who invented the crossbow is up for debate.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-crossbow-used-in-world-war-1>Why was the crossbow used in World War 1?</h2>
<p>In these circumstances, the crossbow was perfect. Crossbow units were assigned to those parts of the battlefield deemed to need their firepower the most. The ranges would be preregistered to ensure accurate fire at the proper distances. In these situations, the crossbow was equally effective in attack or defense.</p>
