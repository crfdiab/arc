<p>Children under 6 years of age must wear a USCG-approved Type I, II or III PFD at all times while on any vessel less than 26 feet in length that is underway. In addition, each person on board a PWC, and anyone being towed behind a vessel must wear a USCG-approved PFD.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-requirement-for-the-uscg-approved-inflatable-pfds>What is a requirement for the USCG approved inflatable PFDs?</h2>
<p>With the exception of kayaks and canoes, every vessel must carry one wearable U.S. Coast Guard-Approved PFD for every person on board if the vessel is 16 feet or longer. Inflatable PFD must be worn in order to be considered readily accessible. Inflatable U.S. Coast Guard-Approved PFD are acceptable for persons age 16.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-5-different-types-of-pfds>What are the 5 different types of PFDs?</h2>
<p>In the United States, the U.S. Coast Guard certifies and regulates PFDs, dividing them into five different types. Within these five categories there are inherently buoyant (foam-filled), inflatable, and hybrid designs.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-uscg-approved-meaning-of-serviceable-condition>What is the USCG approved meaning of serviceable condition?</h2>
<p>Each PFD must meet the USCG definition of serviceable. This means each device must remain in good working condition so it’s effective if needed in an emergency situation.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-not-wear-a-life-jacket-in-ny>How old do you have to be to not wear a life jacket in NY?</h2>
<p>New York law requires that all children under 12 years of age wear a USCG–approved Type I, II, or III PFD while on board any vessel less than 65 feet in length (including canoes, kayaks, and rowboats) unless they are in a fully enclosed cabin.</p>

<p>12<br>
Law Section 73.3. Any youth under the age of 12 on boats 65 feet or less in length must wear a securely fastened U.S. Coast Guard approved personal floatation device of appropriate size. It does not apply if the youth is in a full en- closed cabin. NYS Nav.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-pfd-and-a-life-jacket>What is the difference between a PFD and a life jacket?</h2>
<p>Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs), unlike traditional lifejackets, are more comfortable because they are designed for constant wear. However, they do not generally offer the same level of protection as lifejackets for staying afloat and turning an unconscious person onto their back so you can breathe.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-personal-flotation-device-on-a-boat>Do you need a personal flotation device on a boat?</h2>
<p>All vessels must be equipped with a personal flotation device for each person on board. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) requires that all vessels have at least one Type I, II, or III personal flotation device that is USCGâ€šÃ„Ã®approved, wearable, and of the proper size for each person on board.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-have-a-floatation-device>How old do you have to be to have a floatation device?</h2>
<p>Fine $75. When the operator of a vessel sixteen feet (16 ft.) or more in length is under eighteen (18) years of age, the operator and all other persons aboard the vessel who are under eighteen (18) years of age shall wear a Coast Guard approved personal floatation device of the proper size.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-pfd-do-you-need-for-a-kayak-in-ny>What kind of PFD do you need for a kayak in NY?</h2>
<p>New York law requires the following with respect to PFDs. All vessels (including canoes, kayaks, and rowboats) must have at least one USCG–approved Type I, II, III, or V PFD for each person on board.</p>
