<h2 id=how-many-men-worked-the-decks-on-the-mayflower>How many men worked the decks on the Mayflower?</h2>
<p>thirty men<br>
The Mayflower would have been crewed by about thirty men. Of those, only a handful can be identified with historical records. The ship’s master (the term “captain” was only used for military ships at this time) was Christopher Jones.</p>
<h2 id=what-deck-did-the-pilgrims-stay-on>What deck did the Pilgrims stay on?</h2>
<p>gun deck<br>
Cargo Hold The gun deck, sometimes referred to by the Pilgrims as the “tween deck” or the area “betwixt the decks”, is where the Pilgrims lived for most of hte voyage.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-names-of-the-decks-on-the-mayflower>What were the names of the decks on the Mayflower?</h2>
<p>It was divided into 3 decks- the main deck, gun deck, and cargo hold, and used 3 masts for sail power. The Mayflower served as a merchant trading vessel before it was used to ferry the Pilgrims to the United States.</p>
<h2 id=did-pilgrims-have-bathrooms>Did pilgrims have bathrooms?</h2>
<p>When the Mayflower Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth in the early 17th century, they didn’t smell terrific, according to Native American accounts. Unlike the Wampanoag, these Europeans didn’t bathe regularly. Louis XIV, a 17th-century king of France, is said to have only taken three baths in his entire life.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-cruise-ship-as-big-as-the-titanic>Is there a cruise ship as big as the Titanic?</h2>
<p>Not only is Symphony of the Seas larger than Titanic, all of the Oasis Class cruise ships are larger than the Titanic in gross tonnage, as well as size. Symphony of the Seas measures 1,184 ft 5.0 inches in length and has a gross tonnage of 228,081.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-difficulties-did-the-pilgrims-face>What kind of difficulties did the pilgrims face?</h2>
<p>The Speedwell was the passenger ship, so the Mayflower, designed to carry freight, had to be hastily refitted for the passengers. It was not comfortable; quarters were tight and some freight had to be left behind. Once underway, the Mayflower encountered rough seas and storms and began to leak; a main beam was also damaged.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-pilgrims-get-to-the-new-world>How did the pilgrims get to the New World?</h2>
<p>They were a crucial group in the history of the US. They were an ostracised religious group that escaped from England and came to live in Leiden. From there, they would sail to the New World.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-clothes-did-the-pilgrims-wear>What kind of clothes did the pilgrims wear?</h2>
<p>The pilgrims did wear black clothing on occasion, but those occasions had to be very important, as dyeing clothes a truly deep, pure black was a difficult and expensive process.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-pilgrims-repair-the-mayflower-ship>How did the pilgrims repair the Mayflower ship?</h2>
<p>The ship begins to leak, and the main beam cracks. A passenger is thrown overboard, but catches a rope and is rescued. On the verge of turning back, the crew repairs the beam with a lage iron screw the Pilgrims have brought from Holland. Leaks are plugged with caulk and a mallet. The storm passes, but the ship has been blown off course.</p>
