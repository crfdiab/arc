<h2 id=what-does-the-black-part-of-the-south-african-flag-mean>What does the black part of the South African flag mean?</h2>
<p>Green is considered to symbolize the fertility of the land. Black symbolizes the African community. Gold represents the mineral wealth of the country.</p>
<h2 id=does-south-africa-have-2-flags>Does South Africa have 2 flags?</h2>
<p>A further element of this compromise was that the Union Flag would continue to fly alongside the new South African national flag over official buildings. Thus, South Africa was the only country in the world to have two official national flags.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-display-the-south-african-flag>How do you display the South African flag?</h2>
<p>When the flag is displayed vertically against a wall, the red band should be to the left of the viewer with the hoist or the cord seam at the top. When it is displayed horizontally, the hoist should be to the left of the viewer and the red band at the top.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-flag-colour-of-south-africa>What is the flag Colour of South Africa?</h2>
<p>national flag consisting of a horizontally oriented Y-shape (known in heraldry as a pall) in green, with yellow (gold) and white borders, separating sections of red and blue and a black hoist triangle.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-copyright-on-the-south-african-flag>Is there copyright on the South African flag?</h2>
<p>The use of the flag in manufactured products is subject to the approval of the Department of Trade and Industry (dti). Faan Wolvaardt, director Intellectual Property at Bowman Gilfillan explains: “It will not be possible to register, or protect, packaging or a mark that contains the national flag.</p>
<h2 id=which-colours-were-used-in-the-new-flag-of-south-africa>Which colours were used in the new flag of South Africa?</h2>
<p>It is black, gold, green, white, chilli red and blue. It has a green Y-shaped band that is one fifth as wide as the flag. The centre lines of the band start in the top and bottom corners next to the flag post, converge in the centre of the flag, and continue horizontally to the middle of the free edge.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-copyright-last-south-africa>How long does copyright last South Africa?</h2>
<p>50 years<br>
In South Africa the term of copyright is 50 years from the end of the year in which the work was first made or in which the author dies or is presumed to have died.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-copyright-in-south-africa>How much does it cost to copyright in South Africa?</h2>
<p>There is no such thing as copyright registration in South Africa. Copyright arises automatically and is free.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-black-triangle-go-on-the-south-african-flag>Where does the Black Triangle go on the South African flag?</h2>
<p>In the case of the South African flag, the black triangle must be uppermost and the red band to your left. (One “reads” a flag like the pages of a book – from top to bottom and from left to right – and after rotation the results should be the same.)</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-colors-of-the-south-africa-flag>What are the colors of the South Africa flag?</h2>
<p>Yellow, black, and green are the colors of the National African Congress, the main political party in South Africa. Black represents the people, green represents fertility, and yellow represents the richness of the country’s subsoil. The red, white, and blue also represent the Dutch white minority, the Boers.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-south-africa-need-a-new-flag>Why did South Africa need a new flag?</h2>
<p>Apartheid was coming to an end, a democratic government was being formed, and Nelson Mandela was about to become the first black president of South Africa. The country needed a new flag to represent its new vision. A public competition was held for the design of the new National flag.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-rules-for-flying-the-south-african-flag>What are the rules for flying the South African flag?</h2>
<p>South African law says that the flag must at all times be treated with ” dignity and respect”. Regulations Regarding the Flying of the National Flag, published just before the flag was adopted in 1994, indicates the rules for the display of the flag.</p>
