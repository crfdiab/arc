<h2 id=what-did-genghis-do-that-was-bad>What did Genghis do that was bad?</h2>
<p>Genghis Khan invaded China with 90,000 troops and defeated an army of 1 million plus soldiers. He killed nearly 500,000 soldiers while a great many more, including generals and high ranking officers, defected to the Mongols. It’s not about the size of your army, but how you use it.</p>

<p>Since a 2003 study found evidence that Genghis Khan’s DNA is present in about 16 million men alive today, the Mongolian ruler’s genetic prowess has stood as an unparalleled accomplishment. But he isn’t the only man whose reproductive activities still show a significant genetic impact centuries later.</p>
<h2 id=are-we-all-related-to-genghis-khan>Are we all related to Genghis Khan?</h2>
<p>One in every 200 men alive today is a relative of Genghis Khan.

<h2 id=who-was-the-son-of-genghis-khan-that-tried-to-kill-him>Who was the son of Genghis Khan that tried to kill him?</h2>
<p>Senggum, son of Toghrul (Wang Khan), envied Genghis Khan’s growing power and affinity with his father. He allegedly planned to assassinate Genghis Khan. Although Toghrul was allegedly saved on multiple occasions by Genghis Khan, he gave in to his son and became uncooperative with Genghis Khan.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-genghis-khan-when-he-married-borte>How old was Genghis Khan when he married Borte?</h2>
<p>When Genghis Khan set out on his military conquests he usually took one wife with him and left the rest of his wives (and concubines) to manage the empire in his absence. The marriage between Börte and Genghis Khan (then known as Temüjin) was arranged by her father and Yesügei, Temüjin’s father, when she was 10 and he was 9 years old.</p>
