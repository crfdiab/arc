<h2 id=where-else-might-ecologists-work>Where else might ecologists work?</h2>
<p>Ecologists often have to study and explain how human actions affect other living things and their environment. Ecologists can be teachers or research scientists. They can work for environmental organizations like The Nature Conservancy or for the government. They may work at museums, zoos and aquariums.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-phd-in-ecology-worth-it>Is a PhD in ecology worth it?</h2>
<p>A PhD in ecology would be a good starting point for a career in environmental consulting and environmental impact assessment. It would also be valuable within a government environmental regulatory authority or policy agency.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-skills-needed-to-be-an-ecologist>What are the skills needed to be an ecologist?</h2>
<p>Career progression for a professional ecologist is usually linked to the development of a range of skills including field ecology skills. At each stage of career progression it is expected that the ecologist would be able to demonstrate a level of competence in field ecology skills.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-popular-career-options-in-ecology>What are some popular career options in ecology?</h2>
<p>Natural resource managers find ways to use natural resources, such as water, air and soil, for human use while preserving the resource and the environment. They may spend more time in an office analyzing data and planning than other ecology professionals.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-research-does-an-ecologist-do>What kind of research does an ecologist do?</h2>
<p>An ecologist studies how organisms interact with the environment. Ecologists don’t do all of their studies in the field. They typically read and analyze research by other ecologists, use computer simulations, and perform laboratory studies of animals and plants.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-outcome-of-the-field-ecology-skills-guide>What is the outcome of the field ecology skills guide?</h2>
<p>The outcome is the Field Ecology Skills Guide, which has been separated into two components; education and career progression. Career progression begins with the selection of an undergraduate course and continues in the workplace as a programme of continuing professional development and experiential learning.</p>
