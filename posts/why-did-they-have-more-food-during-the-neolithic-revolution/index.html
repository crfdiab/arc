<h2 id=why-did-they-have-more-food-during-the-neolithic-revolution>Why did they have more food during the Neolithic Revolution?</h2>
<p>The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. These societies radically modified their natural environment by means of specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as irrigation and deforestation which allowed the production of surplus food.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-neolithic-revolution-affect-culture>How did the Neolithic Revolution affect culture?</h2>
<p>The Neolithic Revolution or Neolithic Demographic Transition, sometimes called the Agricultural Revolution, was the wide-scale transition of many human cultures from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement, allowing the ability to support an increasingly large population.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-neolithic-age-lead-to-more-food-for-humans>How did the Neolithic Age lead to more food for humans?</h2>
<p>This was in part due to their increasing domestication of plants. Humans are thought to have gathered plants and their seeds as early as 23,000 years ago, and to have started farming cereal grains like barley as early as 11,000 years ago. Afterward, they moved on to protein-rich foods like peas and lentils.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-effect-of-an-abundance-of-food-during-the-neolithic-revolution>What was the effect of an abundance of food during the Neolithic Revolution?</h2>
<p>If they were lucky and food was abundant, they were able to provide enough food for themselves and their children. If they were unlucky, they starved and died. In order to stay close to their food sources, hunter-gatherers needed to be mobile.</p>
<h2 id=what-food-did-the-neolithic-age-eat>What food did the Neolithic Age eat?</h2>
<p>During this period, humans began domesticating plants such as wheat, barley, lentils, flax and, eventually, all crops grown in today’s society. Neolithic humans also domesticated sheep, cattle, pigs and goats as convenient food sources. Most unprocessed, whole foods logically fit in the Neolithic diet.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-negative-effects-of-the-neolithic-revolution>What were the negative effects of the Neolithic Revolution?</h2>
<p>Neolithic populations generally had poorer nutrition, shorter life expectancies, and a more labor-intensive lifestyle than hunter-gatherers. Diseases jumped from animals to humans, and agriculturalists suffered from more anemia, vitamin deficiencies, spinal deformations, and dental pathologies.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-effects-of-the-neolithic-revolution>What are 3 Effects of the Neolithic Revolution?</h2>
<h2 id=what-did-neolithic-people-have-for-dessert>What did Neolithic people have for dessert?</h2>
<p>The roots of pie as a dessert originated in the Neolithic Period beginning in 9500 B.C. Known as galettes, these free-form pies contained different grains and honey. Galettes baked over hot coals. Pastry originated as bakers added fruit, nuts and honey to bread dough to serve to the pharaoh (1304-1237 B.C.).</p>
<h2 id=what-plants-did-neolithic-people-grow>What plants did Neolithic people grow?</h2>
<p>Plant domestication: Cereals such as emmer wheat, einkorn wheat and barley were among the first crops domesticated by Neolithic farming communities in the Fertile Crescent. These early farmers also domesticated lentils, chickpeas, peas and flax.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-neolithic-revolution>What was the impact of the Neolithic Revolution?</h2>
<p>The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available, with a switch to agriculture which led to a downturn in human nutrition. The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques.</p>
<h2 id=what-foods-did-humans-eat-in-the-neolithic-revolution>What foods did humans eat in the Neolithic Revolution?</h2>
<p>Humans are thought to have gathered plants and their seeds as early as 23,000 years ago, and to have started farming cereal grains like barley as early as 11,000 years ago. Afterward, they moved on to protein-rich foods like peas and lentils.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-early-farmers-in-the-neolithic-revolution-domesticate>What did the early farmers in the Neolithic Revolution domesticate?</h2>
<p>These early farmers also domesticated lentils, chickpeas, peas and flax. Domestication is the process by which farmers select for desirable traits by breeding successive generations of a plant or animal.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-neolithic-people-get-their-livestock>How did the Neolithic people get their livestock?</h2>
<p>Livestock: The first livestock were domesticated from animals that Neolithic humans hunted for meat. Domestic pigs were bred from wild boars, for instance, while goats came from the Persian ibex. Domesticated animals made the hard, physical labor of farming possible while their milk and meat added variety to the human diet.</p>
