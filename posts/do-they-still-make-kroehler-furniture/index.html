<h2 id=do-they-still-make-kroehler-furniture>Do they still make Kroehler furniture?</h2>
<p>Kroehler furniture stopped manufacturing in the 1980s, but it continues to garner interest as the perfect time capsule of the mid 20th Century’s unshakeable design aesthetic. Kroehler armchairs add that Mid-Century Modern magic to a room, plus a dazzling pop of color.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-kroehler-furniture>What happened Kroehler furniture?</h2>
<p>Kroehler Manufacturing Company was known as the world’s largest manufacturer of upholstered furniture and was an industry standard. The company sold its interests and dissolved in 1981.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-find-out-how-much-my-furniture-is-worth>How do I find out how much my furniture is worth?</h2>
<p>Sell most furniture at 70-80% it’s original sale price.</p>
<ol>
<li>The dresser is in good condition, and not very old. You decide that 80% is fair.</li>
<li>Multiply $500 by 80%, or . (500 x . 8 = 400)</li>
<li>$400 is your baseline asking price for the dresser.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=who-makes-kroehler-furniture>Who makes Kroehler furniture?</h2>
<p>Value City Furniture<br>
Owned and operated by Value City Furniture, all Kroehler® brand products are built close to home, here in North Carolina. Scroll this page to find the Kroehler® product that’s perfect for you.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-find-out-what-something-is-worth-for-free>How do I find out what something is worth for free?</h2>
<p>Use your preferred search engine, type in your item, and then include the word database. For instance, if you search “antiques database” there are many results that list prices of collectibles. Kovels is an online database that offers a free subscription to its pricing guide.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-sell-my-couch-for>What should I sell my couch for?</h2>
<p>We generally encourage sellers to list used furniture at about 20 – 50% of the original retail price since furniture is very much like any other depreciable asset. One exception: pieces that are part of a unique or special collection because they tend to lose value once they’re taken from their retail location.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-an-app-that-can-tell-you-how-much-something-is-worth>Is there an app that can tell you how much something is worth?</h2>
<p>The What’s it worth on eBay app determines a realistic average price from items successfully sold in the past weeks. Perfect to find out what you can earn selling something, or to check if a promising bargain really is one.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-out-how-much-an-antique-is-worth>Where can I find out how much an antique is worth?</h2>
<p>“In addition to online services and search engines, it is possible to find out how much your antiques are worth by simply asking an antique dealer or an appraiser at an auction house, for instance,” Martin says.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-a-couch-depreciate-per-year>How much does a couch depreciate per year?</h2>
<p>First, consider that furniture usually has a life expectancy of five years. Assuming the furniture depreciates 20 percent per year, subtract that 20 percent from the purchase price for every year you have owned it.</p>
<h2 id=whats-a-good-price-for-a-used-couch>Whats a good price for a used couch?</h2>
<p>Normally, used couch prices will depend on where you live, but you can usually buy good, used couches somewhere between $30 and $200. You should definitely NOT pay more than $200.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-you-tell-if-something-is-worth-money>How can you tell if something is worth money?</h2>
<p>For most pieces, the value is determined by the rarity and the condition. If an item was mass produced, even if it has been billed as a collectible, it will be worth less than something that was produced in small quantities. Condition is also important. For most items, any imperfections will lessen the value.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-find-out-what-my-inherited-furniture-is-worth>How can I find out what my inherited furniture is worth?</h2>
<p>Take clear, well-lit photographs from all angles. Search the piece for any labels or maker’s marks. Write them down and take photos. Look to see if any previous repairs have been made to the piece (like a new screw replacing an old one). Write down any known provenance of the piece. Was it your grandfather’s? Did it come over on a ship during WWII?</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-get-an-appraiser-for-my-furniture>Where can I get an appraiser for my furniture?</h2>
<p>Reputable auction houses and professional associations such as the American Society of Appraisers are useful resources. Hire someone who specializes in what you need to be appraised. You don’t want a furniture specialist assessing a coin collection. If the appraiser offers to sell your item, walk away; that’s a conflict of interest.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-worth-looking-up-the-value-of-antique-furniture>Is it worth looking up the value of antique furniture?</h2>
<p>However, looking up the value of antique furniture can be a misleading experience, especially when your knowledge is limited. There are so many factors that go into determining antique furniture values, which is why so many people make costly mistakes.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-ok-to-clean-antique-furniture-before-selling>Is it OK to clean antique furniture before selling?</h2>
<p>Don’t touch the furniture until you know its value. It can be tempting to want to spruce up your antique furniture before selling it or bringing it to the appraiser, but hands off! Until you know what you’re dealing with, any attempted repairs or cleaning could lower the value of your piece.</p>
