<h2 id=how-is-the-weather-different-at-different-times-of-the-year-in-antarctica>How is the weather different at different times of the year in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Antarctica only has two seasons: summer and winter. Because it’s located in the southern hemisphere, Antarctica’s summer is from October to February. January is the warmest month in Antarctica, during which average temperatures climb all the way up to 0 degrees in the Antarctic Peninsula.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-weather-does-antarctica-experience>What type of weather does Antarctica experience?</h2>
<p>Antarctica’s Climate Antarctica is the coldest continent on Earth. The average temperature in the interior throughout the year is about -57°C, with the minimum temperature being -90°C during the winter season. Although the coast is warmer and temperatures can reach a maximum of between -2°C and 8°C during the summer.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-weather-is-found-in-antarctica>What kind of weather is found in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>1 Temperature. Antarctica’s average annual temperature ranges from about −10 °C on the coast to −60 °C at the highest parts of the interior. 2 Wind. Antarctica’s environment has special conditions that make it the windiest continent on Earth. 3 Precipitation. 4 Drifting and blowing snow. 5 Blizzards. 6 Whiteout. …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-precipitation-in-the-antarctic>What is the average precipitation in the Antarctic?</h2>
<p>The total precipitation on Antarctica, averaged over the entire continent, is about 166 millimetres (6.5 inches) per year (Vaughan et al., J Climate, 1999).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-highest-temperature-ever-recorded-in-antarctica>What was the highest temperature ever recorded in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>A higher temperature of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) recorded at Signy Research Station on 30 January 1982 was the record for the Antarctic region encompassing all land and ice south of 60° S.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-antarctica-so-cold-compared-to-the-uk>Why is Antarctica so cold compared to the UK?</h2>
<p>Antarctic summers happen at the same time as UK winters. This is because Antarctica is in the Southern Hemisphere, which faces the Sun during our winter time. Why is it so cold and dry? The angle of the Sun is low in the sky. This means the energy from the Sun spreads out over a large area. The area has 24 hours of darkness for some of the winter.</p>
