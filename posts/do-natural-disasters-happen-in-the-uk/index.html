<h2 id=do-natural-disasters-happen-in-the-uk>Do natural disasters happen in the UK?</h2>
<p>The UK’s geographical location exposes it to the risk of natural disasters such as hurricanes, storms, heat waves, low temperatures, and flooding. In September 1782, about 3,500 people were killed during the Central Atlantic hurricane of 1782 while about 2,000 people died in the UK alone in the 2003 European Heatwave.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-natural-disasters-happen-in-the-uk>What kind of natural disasters happen in the UK?</h2>
<p>Floods are the most common form of natural disaster in the UK and are now part and parcel of the British winter months; widespread flooding happens at least once a year in the UK.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-uk-not-have-natural-disasters>Why does UK not have natural disasters?</h2>
<p>There are few areas in the UK likely to be subject to natural disasters and they have an infrastructure capable of dealing with at least some of them without loss of life. It is in a temperate zone so there are no really severe weather patterns. Also it is an old land mass, so no earthquakes.</p>
<h2 id=has-england-ever-had-a-tsunami>Has England ever had a tsunami?</h2>
<p>The coast of Cornwall was hit by a 3 m (10 ft) high tsunami on 1 November 1755, at around 14:00. The waves were caused by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. The tsunami took almost four hours to reach the UK. The tsunami was also observed along the south coast of England and on the River Thames in London.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-natural-disaster-in-uk>What is the biggest natural disaster in UK?</h2>
<p>Storm of the century The great storm of 1953 was Britain’s worst peacetime disaster on record claiming the lives of 307 people. With no severe flood warnings in place and phone lines down, people were completely unaware of the devastation which was about to hit them.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-volcanoes-in-the-united-kingdom>Are there any volcanoes in the United Kingdom?</h2>
<p>There are no active volcanoes in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but there are a few non active volcanoes in some British Overseas Territories. Queen Mary’s Peak in Tristan da Cunha erupted in 1961-2. The Soufrière Hills volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat erupted three times between 1995 and 2013.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-volcanic-islands-in-britain>What are the names of the volcanic islands in Britain?</h2>
<p>The islands of Arran, Mull and Skye are among the remains of a chain of volcanoes that draped much of northern Britain and Ireland in enormous amounts of lava and volcanic ash.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-for-a-hurricane-to-come-near-the-uk>Is it possible for a hurricane to come near the UK?</h2>
<p>It is possible for the remnants of hurricanes to come near the islands and there have been times when storms have crossed the Atlantic, but they lose a lot of strength. By the time they’re on or near the UK’s shores, they’re not technically classified as hurricanes anymore as the winds no longer reach speeds of at least 74 mph.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-britain-get-hit-by-hurricanes>How often does Britain get hit by hurricanes?</h2>
<p>With winds of up to 90 mph (145 kph), the storm killed five people in Britain and caused $250 million (150 million pounds) in damage. Winds from former hurricanes hit Britain and Ireland in 2009, three times in 2006, twice in 2000 and once each in 1996 and 1998, according to the Met Office, Britain’s official weather agency.</p>
