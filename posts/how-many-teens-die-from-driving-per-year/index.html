<h2 id=how-many-teens-die-from-driving-per-year>How many teens die from driving per year?</h2>
<p>According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: A total of 2,476 teenagers ages 13-19 died in motor vehicle crashes in 2018. This is 72 percent fewer than in 1975 and 10 percent fewer than in 2017.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-accidents-a-year-are-caused-by-teenagers>How many accidents a year are caused by teenagers?</h2>
<p>Teen traffic fatalities About 3,000 teens die every year in traffic accidents, and approximately 20 percent of 16 year-olds will be involved in an accident in their first year of driving.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-teenage-drunk-drivers-died>How many teenage drunk drivers died?</h2>
<p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there were 10,874 drunk driving deaths in 2017. We have established that 17 percent of those were because of teen drunk driving. That means that approximately 1,848 fatal crashes were a result of teenage drunk drivers.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-teens-still-drink-and-drive>Why do teens still drink and drive?</h2>
<p>Why Teens Drink And Drive Sometimes the newfound freedom is too much to handle responsibly and other times it’s as simple as peer pressure. Since teens usually have a low tolerance for alcohol and since they are also inexperienced drivers, all of these factors coming together creates a very dangerous situation.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-bad-for-a-teen-to-run-away>Is it bad for a teen to run away?</h2>
<p>Even more shocking though, is the fact that almost all teens have thought about running away at least once. They just don’t all follow through with it. For this reason, it’s important to remember that teens who run away are just like every other teen. They aren’t bad kids.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-sports-go-wrong-for-teens>How often do sports go wrong for teens?</h2>
<p>Teenagers And Sports: When Sports Go Wrong For Teens (and Parents) Every year, millions of teenagers in the United States participate in team sports. Gallup research shows that more than 50 percent of teenagers are on a middle or high school sports team.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-a-teenager-spend-on-a-year>How much does a teenager spend on a year?</h2>
<p>An analysis of the Office for National Statistics household spending survey by the accountancy trade body AAT suggests teens are spending more than £1,000 a year on mobile phones, MP3 players and downloads, £240 on haircuts and £300 on trainers. On top of that are trips to the cinema, nights out and clothes.</p>
