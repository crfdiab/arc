<h2 id=why-does-a-full-moon-affect-behavior>Why does a full moon affect behavior?</h2>
<p>Because sleep deprivation often triggers erratic behavior in people with certain psychological conditions, such as bipolar disorder (formerly called manic depression), the full moon may have been linked to a heightened rate of bizarre behaviors in long-bygone eras.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-full-moon-affect-the-mentally-ill>Does a full moon affect the mentally ill?</h2>
<p>And more recent research, published in 2009, suggested that psychiatric facilities admitted more people during the full moon than usual. This small study, which looked at the records of 91 patients “with violent and acute behavioral disturbance,” found that 23% of these admissions took place during the full moon.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-full-moon-increase-crime>Does a full moon increase crime?</h2>
<p>This followed research by the Sussex Police force that concluded there was a rise in violent crime when the Moon was full. A spokeswoman for the police force said “research carried out by us has shown a correlation between violent incidents and full moons”.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-full-moon-cause-anxiety>Does the full moon cause anxiety?</h2>
<p>For the most part, a full moon doesn’t cause people to become more aggressive, violent, anxious, or depressed. There does seem to be a link between the phases of the moon and changes in symptoms of bipolar disorder.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-full-moon-really-make-people-crazy>Is the full moon really make people crazy?</h2>
<p>Even today, many doctors, nurses, EMT s, police officers, and elementary school teachers agree that full Moons will bring bizarre behavior—43 percent of healthcare professionals believe in what some call “the lunar influence,” as do 81 percent of mental healthcare specialists. But is there really a lunar connection to abnormal behavior?</p>
<h2 id=why-are-people-more-active-during-a-full-moon>Why are people more active during a full moon?</h2>
<p>Many people say the full moon brings about an increase in crime rates. And while that may be true, we can blame it on statistics more than anything else. As science writer Benjamin Radford said on LiveScience.com, ” People are more active during full moons than moonless nights.”</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-more-crime-during-a-full-moon>Why is there more crime during a full moon?</h2>
<p>There is a good reason why there may be more crime on the nights of a full moon; it has to do with statistics, not lunacy. People are more active during full moons than moonless nights.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-a-full-moon-tomorrow-night>Why is there a Full Moon Tomorrow Night?</h2>
<p>Everyone knows that. Right? People have theorized for thousands of years that the Moon has all kinds of impacts on us. It affects fertility, crime rates, dog attacks, and increases blood loss during surgery. It must be a full Moon, they say. Full moon tomorrow night! All the crazies will be out! they say. So what causes all this moon madness.</p>
