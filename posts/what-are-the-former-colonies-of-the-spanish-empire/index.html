<h2 id=what-are-the-former-colonies-of-the-spanish-empire>What are the former colonies of the Spanish Empire?</h2>
<p>Spanish Colonies in Europe. Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, and Portugal were former Spanish colonies in Europe. The countries were all part of the Spanish Empire.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-spanish-colonies-in-north-africa>Are there any Spanish colonies in North Africa?</h2>
<p>That is very different from the relationship of Spain to Melilla. On that basis I would discount Spanish possessions in North Africa and conclude that Spain does not possess any colonies at the current time. It’s very difficult to pinpoint an exact definition of colony that is accurate.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-countries-that-spain-colonized-in-the-world>Are there any countries that Spain colonized in the world?</h2>
<p>In addition to those mentioed by Chrysaor Jordan, there is Spanish Sahara, which is now administered by Morocco. Then there is Florida, Texas, New Mexico and California and much of the western USA and part of Canada. Have you been hacked? 80% of emails online have been exposed in data leaks.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-spanish-colonies-that-still-speak-spanish>Are there any Spanish colonies that still speak Spanish?</h2>
<p>Many of Spain’s former colonies still use Spanish as an official language to this day with numerous different Spanish dialects spoken around the world, but this is not true of all former colonies. Jamaica, the Philippines, Belize and Trinidad and Tobago are former colonies where Spanish is not an official language.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-culture-of-the-spanish-colonies>What was the culture of the Spanish colonies?</h2>
<p>Thus, it is sometimes referred to as the Spanish Colonial Flag. Though influenced by Spanish traditions from the Iberian peninsula, the culture that emerged in the colonial New World was a mixture of European, African, and local Native customs. “Latinized” America was a diverse, capable, and often complex society.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-colonists-of-new-spain-come-from>Where did the colonists of New Spain come from?</h2>
<p>Others came to start large farms, called plantations. By 1550, there were about 100,000 Spanish colonists spread across the Americas. To the south of New Spain, Portugal formed the colony of Brazil. Both Spain and Portugal needed many workers to grow crops and to mine gold and silver.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-spanish-colonies>What was the purpose of the Spanish colonies?</h2>
<p>Spain formed colonies to protect its lands and to govern the people there. A colony is a land ruled by another country. The colony of New Spain was formed in 1535, with most of its land in Mexico and its capital in Mexico City. New Spain also included many islands in the Caribbean Sea and the Spanish lands north of what is now Panama.</p>
