<h2 id=can-you-sail-to-egypt>Can you sail to Egypt?</h2>
<p>Touring / sightseeing Egypt can be done from Port Suez, Hurghada or Port Ghalib. In the Mediterranean, Alexandria is the only alternative to Port Said. Occasionally yachts manage to obtain a permit to sail up the River Nile, a fascinating but not easy way to see Egypt.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-alexandria-egypt>How long does it take to get to Alexandria Egypt?</h2>
<p>Alexandria is located 225 km (140 miles) northwest of Cairo, taking about 2.5 to 3.5 hours to drive from one city to the other depending on route and traffic.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-get-to-egypt-from-usa>How can I get to Egypt from USA?</h2>
<p>U.S. citizens must have a visa to enter Egypt. U.S. citizens can obtain a renewable single-entry 30-day tourist visa on arrival at Egyptian airports for a 25 USD fee. A multiple entry visa is also obtainable for 60 USD.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-sail-from-sicily-to-egypt>How long does it take to sail from Sicily to Egypt?</h2>
<p>It takes approximately 9h 10m to get from Sicily to Egypt, including transfers.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-swim-in-the-nile-in-luxor>Can you swim in the Nile in Luxor?</h2>
<p>Swimming is safe (and encouraged). The section of water between Aswan and Luxor is clean and taking a dip is a real highlight.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-can-you-sail-up-the-nile>How far can you sail up the Nile?</h2>
<p>‘First Nile cruise between Egypt and Sudan has been launched’ is not news from 1875 but end of 2019. If you do that trip, you are somewhere near to the Blue Nile. Altogether, the Nile from Lake Victoria till the delta is about 5500 km. A big part of it can be ‘sailed’, there is a sail club in Khartoum .</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hours-is-egypt-from-italy>How many hours is Egypt from Italy?</h2>
<p>The air travel (bird fly) shortest distance between Egypt and Italy is 2,357 km= 1,465 miles. If you travel with an airplane (which has average speed of 560 miles) from Egypt to Italy, It takes 2.62 hours to arrive.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-ferry-from-egypt-to-italy>Is there a ferry from Egypt to Italy?</h2>
<p>The ferry “Visemar One”, sails the Egyptian sea and has a capacity of 400 passengers, 80 cars and 200 trucks. It links the port of Venice to Alexandria in 60 hours, navigating at a speed of 24 knots.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-it-going-to-take-to-sail-to-greece>How long is it going to take to sail to Greece?</h2>
<p>Now you know the distances in nautical miles, how long is it going to take to sail there? Below is a rough guide to mean speeds in nautical miles per hour for various boat lengths. These speeds are estimated for winds of 4 to 5 beaufort and wave heights of up to 1.5 meters and assume a comfortable cruising speed on a fully loaded boat.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-to-sail-from-london-to-new-york-in-the-18th-century>How long did it take to sail from London to New York in the 18th century?</h2>
<p>Howeverin many cases it only reports when vessels arrive at a port, without mentioning when they departed. In the 18th century journeys of mail ships from London to New York took approximately two weeks longer than merchant ships from Falmouth to Rhode Island. Yet the distance covered by the merchant ships was actually shorter.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-sail-from-new-york-to-the-english-channel>How long does it take to sail from New York to the English Channel?</h2>
<p>The Caird Library holds five continuous editions, the third of which was published in 1973. This edition mentions that typical passage times from New York to the English Channel for a well-found sailing vessel of about 2000 tons was around 25 to 30 days, with ships logging 100-150 miles per day on average.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-nautical-miles-should-i-sail-in-a-day>How many nautical miles should I sail in a day?</h2>
<p>TOP TIP: If you’re after a leisurely sailing holiday (doing 4-5 hours of sailing a day), we’d recommend sailing around 20-25 nM a day.</p>
