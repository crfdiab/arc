<h2 id=how-much-compost-do-i-need-for-an-acre-of-land>How much compost do I need for an acre of land?</h2>
<p>Common application rates of compost are typically between 1.5 and 10 tons of dry compost per acre for annual application, but rates of 50 tons of dry compost per acre are not uncommon if applied sporadically.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-square-feet-does-a-yard-of-compost-cover>How many square feet does a yard of compost cover?</h2>
<p>100 square feet<br>
A yard of any material will cover approximately 100 square feet at 3 inches of depth.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-a-40-lb-bag-of-compost-cover>How much does a 40 lb bag of compost cover?</h2>
<p>A 40 pound bag of topsoil usually contains about . 75 Cubic Feet of soil. There are 25.71404638 Dry Quarts in a Cubic Foot, so a 25 quart bag of potting soil would equal approximately 1 Cubic Foot….How much area does a bag of compost cover?</p>
<table><tr><th>Depth</th><th>Bags/100 sq. ft.</th><th>Yards/Acre</th></tr><tr><td>1″</td><td>14.00</td><td>133</td></tr><tr><td>2″</td><td>28.00</td><td>270</td></tr><tr><td>3″</td><td>42.00</td><td>405</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-many-inches-of-compost-do-i-need>How many inches of compost do I need?</h2>
<p>How much compost or mulch do you need? For mulching, spread 1-3 inches of compost on beds in fall or spring. As a soil amendment before planting new beds, use 1-3 inches of compost dug or tilled into the soil. (Use 3 inches to improve sandy soils, or 1-2 inches for heavy clay soils).</p>
<h2 id=can-i-fill-my-raised-bed-with-just-compost>Can I fill my raised bed with just compost?</h2>
<p>You should never plant in compost alone, but it should be at least 30-50% of your garden soil, whether you are creating your own soil in raised garden boxes or you’re adding it to your existing soil for in-ground planting.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-soil-improver>What is the best soil improver?</h2>
<p>What to use as a soil improver</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural, peat free soil improvers such as Rolawn Soil Improver Compost.</li>
<li>Manure should be well-rotted for at least a year, otherwise it will release nitrogen into the soil too quickly, which can be damaging to some plants.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=can-you-plant-directly-into-compost>Can you plant directly into compost?</h2>
<p>Compost is one of the best garden amendments available. You can plant in straight compost, but I suggest incorporating it into your sandy garden soil or mixing it with other additives if you want to use it for container plantings.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-square-feet-will-40-lbs-of-soil-cover>How many square feet will 40 lbs of soil cover?</h2>
<p>12 square feet<br>
A 40 pound bag of topsoil covers 12 square feet (one inch deep).</p>
<h2 id=can-you-just-put-compost-on-top-of-soil>Can you just put compost on top of soil?</h2>
<p>There are various ways to use your finished compost. You can sprinkle compost on top or mix it into your flower and vegetable beds, gently rake compost into tree beds, blend it with potting soil to revitalize indoor plants, or spread it on top of the soil on your lawn as a soil amendment.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-enrich-poor-soil>How do you enrich poor soil?</h2>
<p>7 Ways to Improve Garden Soil</p>
<ol>
<li>Add Compost. Compost is decomposed organic matter, and it is the best thing you use to improve the health of garden soil.</li>
<li>Get a Soil Test.</li>
<li>Mulch the Soil Surface.</li>
<li>Prevent Soil Compaction.</li>
<li>Rotate Crops Each Year.</li>
<li>Grow Cover Crops.</li>
<li>Add Aged Animal Manure.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-much-compost-should-i-put-in-my-garden>How much compost should I put in my garden?</h2>
<p>STEP 1. Determine the appropriate compost application depth for your project. The general rule of thumb is 1/4 to 1/2 inch if applying to the top of the soil and 1 to 2 inches if you plan to amend the soil. Recommended maximums are 30% to 50% compost in a soil blend, but no more than 30% compost in containers or raised beds.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-i-enter-the-area-to-be-composted>Where do I enter the area to be composted?</h2>
<p>Simply enter in the length and width of the area to be composted, the compost depth desired, and optionally enter in the compost bulk density. That’s it!</p>
<h2 id=can-you-use-compost-in-poorly-drained-soil>Can you use compost in poorly drained soil?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can. Clay soils usually have poor drainage and are poorly drained. Using compost in gardens with this soil type makes the drainage issue worse for the same reason it helps soils stay moist. Did you find this helpful? Share it with your friends!</p>
