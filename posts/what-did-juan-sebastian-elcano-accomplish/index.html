<p>Juan Sebastián del Cano, del Cano also spelled Elcano and de Elcano, (born c. 1476, Guetaria, Castile [now in Spain]—died August 4, 1526, at sea), Basque navigator who completed the first circumnavigation of the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-magellan-to-circumnavigate-the-world>What is the purpose of Magellan to circumnavigate the world?</h2>
<p>Led by explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the armada’s goal was to reach the Spice Islands of Maluku (in the Indonesian archipelago) and open a new trading route for Spain. A modern replica of the Victoria, one of the ships in Magellan’s fleet. Thus began the first recorded trip around the globe.</p>

<p>One of Ferdinand Magellan’s five ships—the Victoria—arrives at Sanlúcar de Barrameda in Spain, thus completing the first circumnavigation of the world. The Victoria was commanded by Basque navigator Juan Sebastian de Elcano, who took charge of the vessel after the murder of Magellan in the Philippines in April 1521.</p>

<p>The seven-ship fleet sailed from La Coruña, Spain in July 1525 and became the second naval expedition in history to cross the Pacific Ocean, after the Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation. The expedition resulted in the discovery of the Sea of Hoces south of Cape Horn, and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-sailor-in-the-world>Who was the first sailor in the world?</h2>
<p>Juan Sebastian Elcano (Getaria, Basque Country, 1476 – Pacific Ocean, 4 August 1526), was a Basque sailor who completed the first circumnavigation of the Earth in human history in the Magellan-Elcano expedition.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-legazpi-succeed-in-colonizing-the-philippines>Why did Legazpi succeed in colonizing the Philippines?</h2>
<p>After deposing a local Muslim ruler, in 1571 he established the city of Manila, which became the capital of the new Spanish colony and Spain’s major trading port in East Asia. Legazpi repulsed two attacks by the Portuguese, in 1568 and 1571, and easily overcame the poorly organized Filipinos’ resistance.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-juan-sebastian-elcano-and-what-did-he-do>Who was Juan Sebastian Elcano and what did he do?</h2>
<p>Juan Sebastián Elcano (sometimes misspelled del Cano; c. 1476 – 4 August 1526) was a Spanish explorer of Basque origin who completed the first circumnavigation of the Earth. After Magellan ‘s death in the Philippines, Elcano took command of the carrack Victoria from the Moluccas to Sanlúcar de Barrameda in Spain.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-juan-sebastian-elcano-go-to-maluku>When did Juan Sebastian Elcano go to Maluku?</h2>
<p>He was part of the expedition to the Spice Islands (another name for the Maluku Islands) that set sail in 1519, captained by Ferdinand Magellan. After Magellan’s death, Elcano took command of the Nao Victoria as it traveled west on its return to Spain from the Maluku Islands.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-juan-sebastian-elcano-die-of-malnutrition>How did Juan Sebastian Elcano die of malnutrition?</h2>
<p>The expedition was a fiasco: of seven ships, only one made it to the Spice Islands, and most of the leaders, including Elcano, perished of malnutrition during the arduous Pacific crossing. Elcano wrote a last will and testament, leaving money to his two illegitimate children and their mothers back in Spain, and died on August 4, 1526.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-magellan-and-elcanos-expedition>What was the purpose of Magellan and Elcano’s expedition?</h2>
<p>Upon the death of Magellan in the Philippines in 1521, Spanish navigator Juan Sebastián Elcano led the expedition in the return trip to Spain. Thus the expedition is often called the Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation. The goal of the expedition was to find a western route to the Moluccas (Spice Islands) and trade for spices.</p>
