<h2 id=what-if-the-russian-revolution-failed-quora>What if the Russian Revolution Failed Quora?</h2>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the failed revolution there would be mass repression of anyone who had anti-Tsarist views or were critical of the regime. The government was almost derailed, there is still unrest in the populous and army, the Imperial Government is going to want to stamp out any threats.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-consequences-of-the-russian-revolution>What were the consequences of the Russian revolution?</h2>
<p>Consequences of Russian Revolution Distribution of the farmland to the farmers and factories to the workers. Nationalization of the banks and formation of the council at a national level to run the economy. Russia pulls itself out of World War I with the treaty of Brest – Litovsk.</p>
<h2 id=how-successful-was-the-russian-revolution>How successful was the Russian revolution?</h2>
<p>Impact of The Russian Revolution The Russian Revolution paved the way for the rise of communism as an influential political belief system around the world. It set the stage for the rise of the Soviet Union as a world power that would go head-to-head with the United States during the Cold War.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-goal-of-the-russian-revolution>What was the goal of the Russian revolution?</h2>
<p>The Russian Revolution took place in 1917, during the final phase of World War I. It removed Russia from the war and brought about the transformation of the Russian Empire into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), replacing Russia’s traditional monarchy with the world’s first Communist state.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-russia-pretending-the-russian-revolution-never-happened>Why is Russia pretending the Russian Revolution never happened?</h2>
<p>Hence the irony that while the West has been discussing the revolution at length, Russia is largely pretending it never happened. Lenin’s marble mausoleum in Red Square must echo with his laughter because that’s just the sort of serpentine political calculation he would have appreciated.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-russian-revolution>What was the outcome of the Russian Revolution?</h2>
<p>He survived by inches. Had any of these events foiled Lenin, our own times would be radically different. Without Lenin there would have been no Hitler. Hitler owed much of his rise to the support of conservative elites who feared a Bolshevik revolution on German soil and who believed that he alone could defeat Marxism.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-october-revolution-still-relevant-to-russia>Is the October Revolution still relevant to Russia?</h2>
<p>The October Revolution, organized by Vladimir Lenin exactly a century ago, is still relevant today in ways that would have seemed unimaginable when Soviet Communism collapsed.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-at-time-of-russian-revolution>Who was president at time of Russian Revolution?</h2>
<p>It’s no coincidence that President Trump’s chief campaign strategist, Steve Bannon, once boasted “I am a Leninist.” One hundred years later, as its events continue to reverberate and inspire, October 1917 looms epic, mythic, mesmerizing.</p>
