<h2 id=how-old-are-the-new-zealand-islands>How old are the New Zealand islands?</h2>
<p>The islands were created just 23 million years ago when land was thrust out of the ocean by volcanic forces. New Zealand has more than 50 volcanoes, some of which are still active today. Sharp snowy peaks, rocky shores, and pastures create a majestic landscape.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-new-zealand-special>What makes New Zealand special?</h2>
<p>New Zealand is one of the most gorgeous countries on earth, and even with its modest size, it packs a lot of history, culture, and attractions for us to experience. New Zealand is known for its stunning national parks, dynamic Māori culture, incredible hiking trails, and world-class skiing and surfing.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-land-does-the-queen-own-in-new-zealand>How much land does the queen own in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>The first-ever stocktake of publicly owned land in Auckland shows “Her Majesty the Queen” as the registered owner of 23,334 hectares, or 4.75 per cent of the city’s land area.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-new-zealand-compared-to-other-countries>How big is New Zealand compared to other countries?</h2>
<p>Other islands are significantly smaller in area. The three largest islands stretch 1,500 kilometres (930 miles) across latitudes 34° to 47° south. New Zealand is the sixth-largest island country in the world, with a land size of 267,710 km 2 (103,360 sq mi).</p>
<h2 id=which-is-more-mountainous-north-or-south-of-new-zealand>Which is more mountainous north or south of New Zealand?</h2>
<p>The South Island is much more mountainous than the North, but shows fewer manifestations of recent volcanic activity. There are 18 peaks of more than 3,000 metres (9,800 feet) in the Southern Alps, which stretch for 500 kilometres (310 mi) down the South Island.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-main-islands-of-new-zealand>What are the two main islands of New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Most of that terrestrial land makes up the two large island s of the country of New Zealand, the North Island and the South Island. Stewart Island, just south of the South Island, and many smaller islets are also a part of Zealandia.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-landscape-does-new-zealand-have>What kind of landscape does New Zealand have?</h2>
<p>New Zealand’s landscape ranges from the fiord-like sounds of the southwest to the sandy beaches of the far north. The South Island is dominated by the Southern Alps while a volcanic plateau covers much of the central North Island.</p>
