<h2 id=why-did-ancient-egyptian-women-have-more-rights>Why did ancient Egyptian women have more rights?</h2>
<p>The influence of queens and queen mothers was considered as a big reason for women’s special rights in ancient Egypt compared to other societies at that time. Queens and queen mothers always had a great power since many pharaohs were very young when they succeeded the throne.</p>

<p>Women were able to represent themselves in court, motion for divorce, own and manage property, free slaves and sue other people. In the eyes of the law, elite men and women were virtually equal. Marriage and divorce proceedings also were surprisingly progressive, even in comparison to today’s Western standards.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-legal-status-of-women-in-ancient-egypt>What was the legal status of women in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Women’s Legal Rights in Ancient Egypt. Ancient Egyptian legal rights extended to women in most situations, which made the nation’s societal structure more egalitarian than most others of the time. Like men, women could buy, sell and manage property.</p>

<h2 id=how-does-migration-affect-the-status-of-women-in-egypt>How does migration affect the status of women in Egypt?</h2>
<p>The migration of a large number of Egyptians, mostly men, has also affected the status of Egyptian women. A study by the International Organization for Migration found that two-thirds of migrant household interviewed were headed by a woman in the absence of the male migrant (husband/father).</p>
