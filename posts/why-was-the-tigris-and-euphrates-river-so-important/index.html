<p>With the Euphrates, it makes up a river system that borders Mesopotamia in the area known as the Fertile Crescent. An important source of both travel and irrigation, the Tigris also has a rich history that dates back to the earliest known civilizations because of its importance to a largely arid region.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-the-rivers-important-in-mesopotamia>Why were the rivers important in Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>The civilization of Ancient Mesopotamia grew up along the banks of two great rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris. In the midst of a vast desert, the peoples of Mesopotamia relied upon these rivers to provide drinking water, agricultural irrigation, and major transportation routes.</p>

<p>The Euphrates Symbolically, this is the first river mentioned in this poem, as it is also the first moments of slavery. Therefore, when Langston Hughes references the negro speaker “[bathing] in the Euphrates when dawns were young,” it can be inferred that he was referencing the birth of slavery itself (Hughes 835).</p>

They were seen as the norm of every day life and most African Americans lived to belief their status as ‘second-class’ citizens.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-tigris-and-the-euphrates-river-important>Why was the Tigris and the Euphrates River important?</h2>

<h2 id=why-are-rivers-and-streams-important-to-civilization>Why are rivers and streams important to civilization?</h2>
