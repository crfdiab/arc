<h2 id=is-azerbaijan-in-europe-or-middle-east>Is Azerbaijan in Europe or Middle East?</h2>
<p>The Republic of Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus area in South-Eastern Europe and South-West Asia. The country lies between the two continents of Asia and Europe. Azerbaijan’s total area size is 33,400 square miles, with around 2,687.27 square miles lying in Europe.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan’s<br>
Azerbaijan’s Geography The capital of Azerbaijan is the ancient city of Baku, which has the largest and best harbour on the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan is located in both Europe and Asia.</p>
<h2 id=is-azerbaijan-in-eu>Is Azerbaijan in EU?</h2>
<p>The Republic of Azerbaijan and the European Union (EU) have maintained a positive relationship through the years and have become more closely linked since 1991. Azerbaijan is currently part of the European Neighborhood Policy, Eastern Partnership and the Council of Europe.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-azerbaijan-located-in-relation-to-europe>Where is Azerbaijan located in relation to Europe?</h2>
<p>This toss up is due to Azerbaijan’s positioning in the Southern Caucasus Region of Eurasia, which is a geographical area between Europe and Asia. No matter which continent Azerbaijan is thought to belong to, the country is surrounded by four countries and one body of water. The Caspian Sea lies along the coast of Azerbaijan’s eastern border.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-armenia-azerbaijan-and-georgia-located>Where are Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia located?</h2>
<p>The precise definition of where Europe and Asia were located was debated well into the 19th century, as the Russian and Iranian empires battled repeatedly for political supremacy of the southern Caucasus Mountains where Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia lie.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-republic-of-azerbaijan-the-same-as-iran>Is the Republic of Azerbaijan the same as Iran?</h2>
<p>Some people refer to Iranian Azerbaijan as South (or Southern) Azerbaijan and the Republic of Azerbaijan as Northern Azerbaijan, although others believe that these terms are irredentist and politically motivated. This term is mainly used by the people of the Republic of Azerbaijan and its usage in Iran is extremely rare.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-republic-of-armenia-in-europe-or-asia>Is the Republic of Armenia in Europe or Asia?</h2>
<p>Geographically speaking, their re-emergence on the international stage renewed debate over whether Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia lie within Europe or Asia. If you use the invisible line of the Ural Mountains and continue it south into the Caspian Sea, then the nations of the southern Caucasus lie within Europe.</p>
