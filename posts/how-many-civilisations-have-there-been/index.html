<h2 id=when-was-the-end-of-prehistory-in-europe>When was the end of prehistory in Europe?</h2>
<p>1st century BC<br>

<p>What Africa had before colonisation March 26, 2015 When Europeans arrived in Africa they found it upon themselves to bring us commerce and civilization. However, Africa had its own forms of commerce, science, art and other measures of civilisation long before the arrival of the colonisers</p>
<h2 id=who-was-looking-for-ancient-civilizations-before-humans>Who was looking for ancient civilizations before humans?</h2>
