<h2 id=what-ships-were-involved-in-the-gulf-of-tonkin-incident>What ships were involved in the Gulf of Tonkin incident?</h2>
<p>The Gulf of Tonkin Incident occurred in August 1964. North Vietnamese warships purportedly attacked United States warships, the U.S.S. Maddox and the U.S.S. C. Turner Joy, on two separate occasions in the Gulf of Tonkin, a body of water neighboring modern-day Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-in-1964-in-the-vietnam-war>What happened in 1964 in the Vietnam War?</h2>
<p>In early August 1964, two U.S. destroyers stationed in the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam radioed that they had been fired upon by North Vietnamese forces. In response to these reported incidents, President Lyndon B. Johnson requested permission from the U.S. Congress to increase the U.S. military presence in Indochina.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-attack-on-north-vietnam>What was the first attack on North Vietnam?</h2>
<p>The First Attack. On July 31, 1964, the destroyer USS Maddox commenced a Desoto patrol off North Vietnam. Under the operational control of Captain John J. Herrick, it steamed through the Gulf of Tonkin collecting intelligence.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-uss-maddox-attacked-in-the-gulf-of-tonkin>When was the USS Maddox attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin?</h2>
<p>Shortly before, the South Vietnamese PTF force had bombarded targets further to the south of Maddox ‘s patrol area. Fragments of the North Vietnamese machine gun bullet recovered from USS Maddox following the 2 August 1964 attack in the Gulf of Tonkin.</p>

<p>In 1964 the Gulf of Tonkin Incident happened – it was claimed that a US ship was attacked by the North Vietnamese though it turned out much later that no attack had taken place. This gave them the excuse to bomb North Vietnam, forcing the Soviets to get involved. North Vietnam retaliated by attacking bases in South Vietnam.</p>
