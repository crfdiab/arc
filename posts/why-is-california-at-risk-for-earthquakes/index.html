<h2 id=why-is-california-at-risk-for-earthquakes>Why is California at risk for earthquakes?</h2>
<p>The earthquakes of California are caused by the movement of huge blocks of the earth’s crust- the Pacific and North American plates. The Pacific plate is moving northwest, scraping horizontally past North America at a rate of about 50 millimeters (2 inches) per year.</p>
<h2 id=is-california-dangerous-because-of-earthquakes>Is California dangerous because of earthquakes?</h2>
<p>California is home to two-thirds of our nation’s earthquake risk. We all know that California is earthquake country. But do you know your local risk? Learn about earthquake faults in your area, and discover the disruptions that could occur after a big quake.</p>
<h2 id=what-earthquake-in-california-caused-the-most-damage>What earthquake in California caused the most damage?</h2>
<p>Loma Prieta earthquake<br>
San Francisco earthquake of 1989, also called Loma Prieta earthquake, major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay Area, California, U.S., on October 17, 1989, and caused 63 deaths, nearly 3,800 injuries, and an estimated $6 billion in property damage.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-risks-of-earthquakes-in-california>What are the risks of earthquakes in California?</h2>
<p>Very large earthquakes that occur closer to the Northern California coast could cause damaging levels of ground shaking here too. Even moderate shaking can damage seismically-vulnerable structures and trigger landslides that could quickly block roads and highways. Soils in lowland areas away from major faults may be subject to liquefaction.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-earthquake-fault-lines-in-southern-california>Are there earthquake fault lines in Southern California?</h2>
<p>*The 75% probability of one or more magnitude 7.0 earthquakes striking Southern California is based on a 30-year period, beginning in 2014. Like all of California, the Central Valley—which is ringed by faults—is earthquake country. Shaking can begin suddenly but have lasting impacts.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-damage-is-caused-by-an-earthquake>What kind of damage is caused by an earthquake?</h2>
<p>The damage caused by earthquakes is from ground shaking, ground rupture, landslides, tsunamis, and liquefaction. Earthquake damage from fires is the most important secondary effect.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-earthquake-in-california-take-place>Where did the earthquake in California take place?</h2>
<p>The focus of the quake was about 10 miles (16 kilometers) underneath the Pacific Ocean, where a triangle of ocean and continental crust meets to form earthquake-prone faults. All earthquakes spring from faults deep underground, but what kind?</p>
