<h2 id=what-is-the-average-temperature-in-mount-everest>What is the average temperature in Mount Everest?</h2>
<p>The Everest summit temperature ranges from an average of minus 4 F to minus 31 F, but the temperature is generally warmer as the winds blow more gently from the end of May until the third week of October, according to weather reports.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-yearly-precipitation-on-mount-ararat>What is the average yearly precipitation on Mount Ararat?</h2>
<p>20.4 inch per year<br>
The rainfall in Ararat is significant, with precipitation even during the driest month. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is Cfb. The temperature here averages 13.4 °C | 56.2 °F. Precipitation here is about 518 mm | 20.4 inch per year.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-yearly-precipitation-on-k2>What is the average yearly precipitation on K2?</h2>
<p>Precipitation in Skardu amounts to 250 mm (10 in) per year, with a relative maximum between winter and spring. Here is the average precipitation. Expeditions to K2 are typically organized between the second half of July and early August.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-weather-like-at-the-top-of-mount-everest>What’s the weather like at the top of Mount Everest?</h2>
<p>The Climate of Mount Everest. 1 Temperature of Mount Everest. The temperature at the Mt. Everest summit in January is average -33° F (-36° C) and it can drop to -76° F (-60° C) even. 2 Humidity of Mount Everest. 3 Wind on Mount Everest. 4 Precipitaion of Mount Everest. 5 Climbing Seasons of Everest.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-nearest-weather-station-to-the-summit-of-mt-everest>Which is the nearest weather station to the summit of Mt Everest?</h2>
<p>The nearest weather station to the summit is at Lobuche and is known as the “Pyramid Station.” The weather station is at elevation of 5,079m and has been operating since 2006. Obtaining accurate forecasts at the summit is essential for climbers and many teams hire meteorologists to produce daily spot weather forecasts.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-wind-affect-air-pressure-on-mount-everest>How does wind affect air pressure on Mount Everest?</h2>
<p>The speed of wind can reach about 80 km/h (about 50 mph), the flag-shaped cloud will be right at an angle to the summit. The air pressure at the summit is just about one-third of that at sea level. And the winds strong like this can result in lower air pressure and cause an additional oxygen reduction to climbers.</p>
