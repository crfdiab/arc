<h2 id=what-is-a-tsunami-wave>What is a tsunami wave?</h2>
<p>A tsunami is a series of extremely long waves caused by a large and sudden displacement of the ocean, usually the result of an earthquake below or near the ocean floor. This force creates waves that radiate outward in all directions away from their source, sometimes crossing entire ocean basins.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-underwater-earthquakes-called>What are underwater earthquakes called?</h2>
<p>A submarine, undersea, or underwater earthquake is an earthquake that occurs underwater at the bottom of a body of water, especially an ocean. When the rough spots can no longer hold, the sudden release of the built-up motion releases, and the sudden movement under the sea floor causes a submarine earthquake.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-tsunami-brief>What is tsunami brief?</h2>
<p>Tsunami (pron: ‘soo-nar-me’) is a Japanese word: ‘tsu’ meaning harbour and ‘nami’ meaning wave. Tsunami are waves caused by sudden movement of the ocean surface due to earthquakes, landslides on the sea floor, land slumping into the ocean, large volcanic eruptions or meteorite impact in the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=are-tsunamis-caused-by-an-underwater-earthquake>Are tsunamis caused by an underwater earthquake?</h2>
<p>Tsunamis. These destructive surges of water are caused by underwater earthquakes. A tsunami is a series of ocean waves that sends surges of water, sometimes reaching heights of over 100 feet (30.5 meters), onto land. These walls of water can cause widespread destruction when they crash ashore.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-types-of-tsunami>What are the types of tsunami?</h2>
<p>Tsunamis can occur when the earthquake is shallow-seated and strong enough to displace parts of the seabed and disturb the mass of water over it. There are two types of tsunami generation: Local tsunami and Far Field or distant tsunami.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-deadliest-tsunami-ever-recorded>What is the deadliest tsunami ever recorded?</h2>
<p>2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami: The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami was one of the deadliest and most destructive natural disasters in human history. The undersea megathrust earthquake struck the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, on Dec. 26, 2004.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-after-an-earthquake-is-a-tsunami>How long after an earthquake is a tsunami?</h2>
<p>The tsunami can come in less than five minutes after the earthquake. Therefore, people in this area do not have enough time to wait for a warning from BMKG.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-undertow-of-a-wave-come-from>Where does the undertow of a wave come from?</h2>
<p>Undertow is a natural and universal feature for almost any large body of water: it is a return flow compensating for the onshore-directed average transport of water by the waves in the zone above the wave troughs.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-name-of-the-wave-that-breaks-along-its-length>What’s the name of the wave that breaks along its length?</h2>
<p>These are the first small waves created when the wind blows on the sea. (i.e. baby swell) Moderate local winds form little waves known as chop which can kill a good surf session. It’s also know as “wind chop.” This is a wave that breaks along its entire length at the same time making it unsurfable.</p>

<h2 id=why-are-wave-crests-parallel-to-the-underwater-contours>Why are wave crests parallel to the underwater contours?</h2>
<p>This represent the tendency of wave crests to become parallel to underwater contours as waves move into shallower waters. Waves moving in shallow waters move more slowly than waves moving in deeper water. Refraction can be seen where waves wrap round a point and their direction seems to change.</p>
