<h2 id=how-did-aboriginals-greet-each-other>How did aboriginals greet each other?</h2>
<p>Palya is a Pintupi language word used as a greeting much in the same way that two friends would say hello in English while Yaama is a Gamilaraay language word for hello used in Northern NSW.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-aboriginal-handshake>What is an Aboriginal handshake?</h2>
<p>The Sacred Indian Handshake: When you first meet an Indigenous person, hold out your left hand (NEVER, EVER, EVER USE YOUR RIGHT HAND!), lift your thumb to a 90-degree angle, then extend your index finger… There is no sacred Indian handshake.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-aboriginals-shake-hands>How do aboriginals shake hands?</h2>
<p>They lead the handshake. If they grab your hand firmly, squeeze really hard twice, while doing the salt and pepper shaker action, then you do all of that in return. You don’t lead in case they don’t do any of that.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-word-nunga-mean>What does the word nunga mean?</h2>
<p>Nunga is a term of self-identification for Aboriginal Australians, originally used by Aboriginal people in the southern settled areas of South Australia, and now used throughout Adelaide and surrounding towns. It is used by contrast with Gunya, which refers to non-Aboriginal persons.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-aboriginal-people-do-with-their-hands>What do Aboriginal people do with their hands?</h2>
<p>Five women elders from remote Western Australia share the joys and meanings of Aboriginal sign language. This opens in a new window. T alking with our hands is one of the most human things we do.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-aboriginal-people-mean-when-they-say-what>What do Aboriginal people mean when they say what?</h2>
<p>The usual response to the “what?” sign is the sign for “nothing,” indicating that there is no need to take action. A s people who often possess superior eyesight, many Aboriginal people can see signs over especially long distances. Signs are also essential for silent communication while hunting.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-i-do-to-help-aboriginal-people-in-victoria>What can I do to help Aboriginal people in Victoria?</h2>
<p>The Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages has an excellent resource to help with the pronunciation of sounds – the Talking Head application shows the position of tongue and teeth to create the sounds and gives examples from local Victorian languages. Say G’day wordle.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-use-hand-gestures-when-speaking>Why is it important to use hand gestures when speaking?</h2>
<p>Gesturing helps you access memories. Using hand gestures while you speak not only helps others remember what you say, it also helps you speak more quickly and effectively! Nonverbal explanations help you understand more.</p>
