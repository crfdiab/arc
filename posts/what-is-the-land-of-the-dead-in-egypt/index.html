<h2 id=what-is-the-land-of-the-dead-in-egypt>What is the land of the dead in Egypt?</h2>
<p>Duat (Ancient Egyptian: dwꜣt, Egyptological pronunciation “do-aht”, Coptic: ⲧⲏ, also appearing as Tuat, Tuaut or Akert, Amenthes, Amenti, or Neter-khertet) is the realm of the dead in ancient Egyptian mythology. The underworld was also the residence of various other gods along with Osiris.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-egyptians-call-their-land-the-black-land>Why did the Egyptians call their land the black land?</h2>
<p>The Egyptians called their country Kemet, literally the “Black Land” (kem meant “black” in ancient Egyptian). The name derived from the colour of the rich and fertile black soil which was due to the annually occurring Nile inundation. So Kemet was the cultivated area along the Nile valley.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-egyptians-called-their-land-and-why>What does the Egyptians called their land and why?</h2>
<p>To the ancient Egyptians themselves, their country was simply known as Kemet, which means ‘Black Land’, so named for the rich, dark soil along the Nile River where the first settlements began.</p>
<h2 id=who-ruled-the-world-of-the-dead>Who ruled the world of the dead?</h2>
<p>Osiris was the god and chief judge of the underworld. He was also god of vegetation and the annual Nile flood and was closely associated with death, resurrection and fertility.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-book-of-the-dead-exist>Does the book of the dead exist?</h2>
<p>There was no single or canonical Book of the Dead. The surviving papyri contain a varying selection of religious and magical texts and vary considerably in their illustration. The finest extant example of the Egyptian Book of the Dead in antiquity is the Papyrus of Ani. Ani was an Egyptian scribe.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-ancient-egyptians-call-the-land-of-the-dead>What did ancient Egyptians call the land of the dead?</h2>
<p>In essence, the ancient Egyptians saw the east bank as “the land of the living” since that’s where the sun rose every morning. They built their temples and homes on that side, and they thought of the west bank as “the land of the dead” since that’s where the sun sets.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-ancient-egyptians-call-their-country-the-two-lands>Why did the ancient Egyptians call their country the two lands?</h2>
<p>It coated the land along the river with minerals amidst the soil, which allowed them to grow crops. The people of Egypt called their country “the Two Lands,” which signifies the way they viewed their home—as a duality.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-nile-the-land-of-the-dead-or-the-living>Is the Nile the land of the dead or the living?</h2>
<p>The symbolic separation between the land of the dead and the living can be seen between the ancient architecture on the eastern and western sides of the Nile, in fact, the Nile itself can be seen as a representation of the river one crossed after death to get to the ‘Land of the Two Fields’.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-land-of-the-dead-come-from>Where did the land of the dead come from?</h2>
<p>The land of the dead is mentioned in several important texts, not least of all, the earliest known written story in human history; The Sumerian ‘ Epic of Gilgamesh ‘.</p>
