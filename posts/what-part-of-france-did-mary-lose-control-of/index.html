<h2 id=what-part-of-france-did-mary-lose-control-of>What part of France did Mary lose control of?</h2>
<p>During Mary’s reign she lost the strategic town of Calais which had been ruled by England for hundreds of years, so this meant that France now controlled the entire northern coastline of France and left England more vulnerable of an attack.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-mary-tudor-queen-of-france>What happened to Mary Tudor queen of France?</h2>
<p>Childless and grief-stricken by 1558, Mary had endured several false pregnancies and was suffering from what may have been uterine or ovarian cancer. She died at St. James Palace in London, on November 17, 1558, and was interred at Westminster Abbey. Her half-sister succeeded her on the throne as Elizabeth I in 1559.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-mary-tudor-queen-of-france-die>When did Mary Tudor, Queen of France Die?</h2>
<p>The date of Mary’s death is November 17th,1558, not June 25th,1533 Get it right! James, you’re talking about Mary I (Henry VIII’s daughter) and, yes, she did die in 1558, but Mary Tudor, Queen of France (Henry VIII’s sister), died in 1533. The article is correct.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-funeral-of-mary-tudor-held>Where was the funeral of Mary Tudor held?</h2>
<p>As Dowager Queen of France and sister of the king, Mary Tudor’s funeral was a lavish affair. Her body was embalmed and for three weeks Mary’s coffin, draped in deep blue or black velvet, lay in state at Westhorpe, candles burning day and night. On 10th July, Henry VIII ordered a Requiem Mass to be held for his sister at Westminster Abbey.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-mary-tudors-sister-when-she-left-england>How old was Mary Tudor’s sister when she left England?</h2>
<p>Then, when Mary was eight years old, her older sister Margaret, then fourteen, left England for Scotland to marry King James IV. Mary and her older brother Henry were the only two siblings left in England and it has been suggested that during this time, growing up together, they formed a close bond which survived until Mary’s death.</p>
