<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-there-are-two-moons-in-one-month>What is it called when there are two moons in one month?</h2>
<p>The term black moon refers to an additional new moon that appears in a month or in a season. It may also refer to the absence of a full moon or of a new moon in a month.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-you-see-two-full-moons>What does it mean when you see two full moons?</h2>
<p>Seeing two moons at the same time means you have to make a fateful choice. And it will touch both real relationships and spiritual progress. A dream of two full moons of especially bloody color is the sad forerunner of the times in which only Darkness will reign on earth.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-god-say-about-the-moon>What does God say about the Moon?</h2>
<p>“The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord,” – Joel 2:31. “The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord.” – Acts 2:20.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-two-full-moons-in-one-month>Are there two full moons in one month?</h2>
<p>And even though the Gregorian calendar — which is your average January through December calendar — evolved from the lunar calendar, the months of the year don’t quite align with the moon’s cycle. Because of that, sometimes there will be two full moons in one month — and it’s happening twice in 2018.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-second-full-moon-in-february>Is there a second full moon in February?</h2>
<p>One use of the term is for the occurrence of a second new moon in a calendar month. This is analogous to the by-month definition of a blue moon as the second full moon in a month. February is too short for a second new moon to occur.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-there-is-no-new-moon-in-a-month>What does it mean when there is no new moon in a month?</h2>
<p>It may also refer to the absence of a full moon or of a new moon in a month. One use of the term is for the occurrence of a second new moon in a calendar month. This is analogous to the by-month definition of a blue moon as the second full moon in a month.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-a-lunar-month-different-from-a-lunation-month>How is a lunar month different from a lunation month?</h2>
<p>A lunar month is the time it takes the Moon to pass through all of the Moon phases, measured from one New Moon to the next New Moon. A lunar month comprises all the Moon phases. A lunar month is also known as a lunation, while the astronomical term for this period is a synodic month, from the Greek term synodos, meaning meeting or conjunction.</p>
