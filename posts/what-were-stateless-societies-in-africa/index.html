<h2 id=what-were-stateless-societies-in-africa>What were stateless societies in Africa?</h2>
<p>Stateless Societies: these are societies that organize authority around kinship or other obligations. Sometimes these stateless societies were quite large while others were small. No need to tax people if you don’t have a large government. Authority only affected small parts of peoples lives.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-example-of-a-stateless-society>What is an example of a stateless society?</h2>
<p>Examples are the shaman diviners in Kwakiutl and many stateless societies in Asia, or the prophets and diviners in Nuer, Turkana, Tonga, and many other African societies. The stateless society is both an empirical, historical fact and a comment on political theory.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-stateless-societies-organized-in-africa>How were stateless societies organized in Africa?</h2>
<p>Stateless societies lacked a centralized hierarchy of government officials and a bureaucracy and instead were led by family groups that balanced the ruling power among them and made decisions together for the good of the whole society. Occasionally, these stateless societies even grew into cities.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-stateless-society-give-a-recent-example-in-africa>What is a stateless society give a recent example in Africa?</h2>
<p>One example of a stateless society is the Igbo people, an ethnic group who lived in modern-day Nigeria. The ancient Igbo people developed very successful stateless societies. Igbo communities were ruled over by a council of elected elders, who really had very little practical power beyond resolving disputes.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-stateless-societies-today>Are there stateless societies today?</h2>
<p>While stateless societies were the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a sovereign state, though in some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield little or no actual power.</p>
<h2 id=is-communism-a-stateless-society>Is communism a stateless society?</h2>
<p>A communist society is characterized by common ownership of the means of production with free access to the articles of consumption and is classless and stateless, implying the end of the exploitation of labour.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-stateless-state>What is a stateless state?</h2>
<p>A stateless nation is an ethnic group or nation that does not possess its own state and is not the majority population in any nation state. The term “stateless” implies that the group “should have” such a state (country). Nations without state are classified as fourth-world nations.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-stateless-society-possible>Is a stateless society possible?</h2>
<h2 id=do-communists-want-a-moneyless-society>Do Communists want a moneyless society?</h2>
<p>Communism: The end goal of human existence as described by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. A classless, stateless, moneyless society where the means of production are held by all and production is done on the basis of human need rather than profit. Can only be reached after a revolution led by the proletariat.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-stateless-society-in-ancient-africa>What was the stateless society in ancient Africa?</h2>
<p>Stateless Societies in Africa. Another form of culture that was popular in ancient Africa was the stateless society. A stateless society is a non-nomadic civilization that is not governed by any sort of central authority.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-be-in-a-stateless-society>What does it mean to be in a stateless society?</h2>
<p>Stateless society. A stateless society is a society that is not governed by a state, or, especially in common American English, has no government. In stateless societies, there is little concentration of authority; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in power and are generally not permanently held positions;</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-societies-are-there-in-africa>What kind of societies are there in Africa?</h2>
<p>Stateless Societies in Africa. A stateless society is a non-nomadic civilization that is not governed by any sort of central authority. People in a stateless society most often practice agriculture and are settled in one place, but they retain the democratic process and are opposed to one person being dramatically more powerful than the rest.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-concentration-of-authority-in-a-stateless-society>Is there a concentration of authority in a stateless society?</h2>
<p>In stateless societies, there is little concentration of authority; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in power and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small.</p>
