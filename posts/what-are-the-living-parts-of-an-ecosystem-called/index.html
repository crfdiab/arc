<h2 id=what-are-the-living-parts-of-an-ecosystem-called>What are the living parts of an ecosystem called?</h2>
<p>The living parts of an ecosystem are called biotic factors while the environmental factors that they interact with are called abiotic factors.</p>
<h2 id=do-plants-and-animals-make-up-an-ecosystem>Do plants and animals make up an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>An ecosystem is made up of all the living animals and plants and the non-living matter in a particular place, like a forest or lake. All the living things in an ecosystem depend on all the other things – living and non-living for continued survival – for food supplies and other needs.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-up-the-living-part-of-an-ecosystem>What makes up the living part of an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>These features create condi- tions that support a community of plants and animals that evolution has produced to live in these specific conditions. The living part of the ecosystem is referred to as its biotic component. Ecosystems are divided into terrestrial or land- based ecosystems, and aquatic ecosystems in water.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-a-farm-part-of-an-ecosystem>Why is a farm part of an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>A farm is an ecosystem because it is made of living and non-living things that interact and exchange energy.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-living-organism>Which is an example of a living organism?</h2>
<p>The lynx and the hare are two examples of the biotic,or living parts of an ecosystem. All living organisms – including humans, bacteria, insects, and plants – are the biotic part of an ecosystem. The lynx and the hare are also interacting with the abiotic, or non-living, parts of their ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-non-living-component-of-an-ecosystem>Which is an example of a non living component of an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>The non living components within an ecosystem are called the abiotic components, examples of abiotic components are the climate (sun light, rainfall) and rocks. The living components are biotic, these include vegetation, animals and humans. Ecosystems can be very big, or very small.</p>

<p>The living parts of an ecosystem are called biotic factors while the environmental factors that they interact with are called abiotic factors. Because living things both respond to and are influenced by their environment, it is important to study both factors together to get a full picture. Because we are talking about interactions, ecosystems</p>
<h2 id=how-is-an-ecosystem-related-to-the-environment>How is an ecosystem related to the environment?</h2>
<p>An ecosystem is a community of organisms and their physical environment interacting together. Environment involves both living organisms and the non-living physical conditions. These two are inseparable but inter-related. The living and physical components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-scientists-look-for-in-an-ecosystem>What do scientists look for in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>When studying an ecosystem scientists look at all the various living components and how they interact with one another as well as how they interact with their surrounding environment. The living parts of an ecosystem are called biotic factors. This includes all the living organisms in the ecosystem, such as plants, animals, fungi,…</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-function-and-structure-of-an-ecosystem>What is the function and structure of an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>The ecosystem is the structural and functional unit of ecology where the living organisms interact with each other and the surrounding environment. In other words, an ecosystem is a chain of interaction between organisms and their environment.</p>
