<p>The in-store drop-off recycling program collects old shoes and turns them into new Nike products. The program collects old, worn-out athletic shoes for recycling and transforms them into Nike Grind, a material used in creating athletic and playground surfaces as well as select Nike products. …</p>

<p>On average you should keep your shoes for between 8 and 12 months before replacing them. This averages to around 300 to 500 miles for running shoes. One good indicator that your shoes are worn is when the support and cushioning start to become compressed and the material doesn’t bounce back the way it used to.</p>

<p>A newly developed recycling process could make landfill sites filled with old shoes a thing of the past. “Footwear is incredibly difficult to recycle as it can contain up to forty different types of material, many of which are stitched or glued together,” says Professor Shahin Rahimifard, who led the project.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-should-a-pair-of-shoes-last>How long should a pair of shoes last?</h2>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, shoes should be replaced every 8-12 months for most people or every 500-700 kilometres for running shoes. Some shoes will last longer, and some will wear out more quickly.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-put-shoes-in-black-bin>Can you put shoes in black bin?</h2>
<p>Don’t put them in your food waste bin: clothes, shoes and textiles. black refuse bags.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-ok-to-wear-the-same-shoes-everyday>Is it OK to wear the same shoes everyday?</h2>

That sounds pretty gross, but it’s totally normal — as long as you give the shoe ample time to dry. “If you wear the same pair everyday, your shoes don’t have ample time to dry and they won’t maintain their shape,” Kass told us …</p>
<h2 id=can-worn-out-shoes-hurt-your-feet>Can worn out shoes hurt your feet?</h2>
<p>Old Shoes – Old or worn out shoes are one of the most common problems we see as podiatrists. Usually people use the oldest shoes to do the dirtiest work or hardest work. This can cause problems such as plantar fasciitis, achilles tendonitis or other foot conditions caused by a lack of support.</p>

<h2 id=how-do-you-tell-if-your-shoes-are-worn-out>How do you tell if your shoes are worn out?</h2>
<p>Take your shoes off your feet and set them side by side on a level surface. Get down so your eyes are level with the surface and check to see if there’s a visible slant to the soles at the heels. If there is, you’ve got a worn out pair of shoes on your hands.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-way-to-repurpose-an-old-shoe>Is there a way to repurpose an old shoe?</h2>
<p>Shoe lovers in your life can, ironically, be hard to shop for. Shoes in general are out, unless you know their size in a particular brand. Crafting something from an old shoe is a way to repurpose an item that would otherwise be tossed.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-shoes-that-can-be-re-soled>Are there any shoes that can be re-soled?</h2>
<p>Some rubber-bottom shoes and boots can be re-soled, too. Vibram soles are often recommended. There will be a few exceptions, but overall sneakers are nearly impossible to re-sole. Their soles are typically integrated into their overall design and cannot be replaced. Some repairs are possible, though, so ask to be sure.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-do-with-old-nike-shoes>What can you do with old Nike shoes?</h2>
<p>ASICS will take old clothes and shoes and repurpose them into other clothing, toy stuffing, carpet padding, and insulation fibers. This New Atlas article outlines the fate of other recycled shoes. First, they get their eyelets and other metal parts taken out. Then, like with Nike, the shoes go through a shredder and a granulator.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-re-sole-a-leather-bottom-shoe>Can you re-sole a leather bottom shoe?</h2>
<p>YES: Re-sole Leather-bottom Shoes. We’ll start basic: Most shoes with leather or faux leather soles can be re-soled when they begin to show wear. Your cobbler may suggest a sturdier sole style than the shoe came with to extend its life.</p>
