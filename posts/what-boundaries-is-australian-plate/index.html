<h2 id=what-boundaries-is-australian-plate>What boundaries is Australian plate?</h2>
<p>The Hikurangi tectonic plate boundary is a convergent boundary. This means that the Australian and Pacific plates are pushing against each other.</p>
<h2 id=what-continents-are-on-the-indo-australian-plate>What continents are on the Indo-Australian Plate?</h2>
<p>The Indo-Australian Plate. The Indo-Australian Plate is a large crustal plate that includes the continent of Australia and the sub-continent of India.</p>
<h2 id=are-india-and-australia-on-the-same-tectonic-plate>Are India and Australia on the same tectonic plate?</h2>
<p>The Indian Plate or India Plate is a minor tectonic plate straddling the Equator in the Eastern Hemisphere. Once fused with the adjacent Australia to form a single Indo-Australian Plate, recent studies suggest that India and Australia have been separate plates for at least 3 million years and likely longer.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-causing-the-australian-plate-to-move>What is causing the Australian Plate to move?</h2>
<p>Australia’s movement is caused by the shifting tectonic plates that make up the earth’s surface. The North American plate, by contrast, travels roughly one inch per year.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-tectonic-plates-in-australia>Are there tectonic plates in Australia?</h2>
<p>Australia doesn’t sit on the edge of a tectonic plate. However, the Indo-Australian plate, at the centre of which our continent lies, is being pushed to the north-east at about 7cm per year. It’s colliding with the Eurasian, Philippine and Pacific plates, causing stress to build up in the 25km-thick upper crust.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-indian-plate-the-same-as-the-australian-plate>Is the Indian Plate the same as the Australian Plate?</h2>
<p>In orange and red is the Indo-Australian plate, shown as divided between the Indian Plate and the Australian Plate The Indo-Australian Plate is a major tectonic plate that includes the continent of Australia and surrounding ocean, and extends northwest to include the Indian subcontinent and adjacent waters.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-car-registration-plates-come-from-in-australia>Where do car registration plates come from in Australia?</h2>
<p>In Australia, vehicle registration plates, usually known as number plates or ‘rego plates’, are normally issued by the State or Territory government; until 2000 some were issued by the Commonwealth government.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-eastern-part-of-the-australian-plate-moving>How is the eastern part of the Australian Plate moving?</h2>
<p>Plate movements. The eastern part (Australia) is moving northward at the rate of 5.6 cm (2.2 in) per year while the western part (India) is moving only at the rate of 3.7 cm (1.5 in) per year due to the impediment of the Himalayas. This differential movement has resulted in the compression of the former plate near its centre at Sumatra and…</p>
<h2 id=how-many-countries-are-in-australia-and-oceania>How many countries are in Australia and Oceania?</h2>
<p>The 15 countries of Australia and Oceania vary widely by culture and occupy a large swath of the world ocean. With the exception of continent/country Australia, the region does not occupy a great deal of land.</p>
