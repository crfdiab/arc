<h2 id=what-formed-the-ouachita-mountains>What formed the Ouachita Mountains?</h2>
<p>The Ouachita Mountains (/ˈwɒʃɪtɔː/), simply referred to as the Ouachitas, are a mountain range in western Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma. They are formed by a thick succession of highly deformed Paleozoic strata constituting the Ouachita Fold and Thrust Belt, one of the important orogenic belts of North America.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-ouachita-orogeny-occur>When did the Ouachita orogeny occur?</h2>
<p>The deformation is Late Paleozoic in age, probably culminating between the Late Carboniferous and the Early Permian (about 318 million to 271 million years ago). The orogeny resulted in a northward and westward compression in the geosynclinal strata onto adjacent platform rocks.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-antler-orogeny>What caused the Antler orogeny?</h2>
<p>As outlined in the following paragraphs, plate motion along the western margin of the North American continent in the Late Devonian has been offered as the cause of the orogeny and three varieties of it have been tried—east dipping subduction, west-dipping subduction, and strike-slip motion.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-laramide-orogeny-form>How did the Laramide orogeny form?</h2>
<p>The Laramide orogeny occurred from approximately 70 million years ago to 40 million years ago during a period when the Farallon oceanic plate was subducting rapidly beneath the western coast of the U.S. The most unusual aspect of the Laramide orogeny is the fact that the mountain ranges created during this period were …</p>
<h2 id=what-two-rivers-are-in-craighead>What two rivers are in Craighead?</h2>
<p>Craighead County has 27 named lakes and reservoirs, two rivers (St. Francis and Cache Rivers,) and countless ditches and sloughs, so the need is great.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-are-the-ouachita-mountains-in-oklahoma>How old are the Ouachita Mountains in Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>The Ouachita Mountains in southeastern Oklahoma are part of the only major mountain region between the Rockies and the Appalachians. The Ouachitas are fold mountains, formed about 300 million years ago when the South American Plate drifted northward, colliding with the North American Plate.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-ouachita-mountains-form-in-south-america>When did the Ouachita Mountains form in South America?</h2>
<p>The Ouachitas are fold mountains, formed about 300 million years ago when the South American Plate drifted northward, colliding with the North American Plate. The first recorded exploration by Europeans was in 1521 by Hernando de Soto. Forming part of the Louisiana Purchase, President Jefferson sent William Dunbar and Dr.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-ouachita-mountains-located-in-arkansas>Where are the Ouachita Mountains located in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>The Central Ouachita Mountains region, sometimes called the Novaculite Uplift, is the most diverse subdivision of the Ouachitas. It stretches from near Oklahoma to Little Rock and is widest (north to south) near the middle, west of Hot Springs, narrowing both to the east and west.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-ouachita-mountains-national-forest>How big is the Ouachita Mountains National Forest?</h2>
<p>The Ouachita National Forest covers approximately 1.8 million acres of the Ouachitas. It is one of the largest and oldest national forests in the Southern U.S., created through an executive order by President Theodore Roosevelt on December 18, 1907.</p>
