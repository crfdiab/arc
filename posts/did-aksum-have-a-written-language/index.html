<h2 id=did-aksum-have-a-written-language>Did Aksum have a written language?</h2>
<p>The oldest known inscription in the language dates from the 3rd or 4th century and is written in a script that does not indicate vowels. Subsequent inscriptions found in the ancient Ethiopian capital of Aksum were written from the 4th through the 9th century in a script that does indicate vowels.</p>
<h2 id=which-two-languages-did-aksum-use-for-its-written-records>Which two languages did Aksum use for its written records?</h2>
<p>Some of these stelae are among the largest known from the ancient world. The Aksumites left behind a body of written records, that, although not voluminous, are nonetheless a legacy otherwise bequeathed only by Egypt and Meroë among ancient African kingdoms. These records were written in two languages–Gi’iz and Greek.</p>

<p>There is some linguistic (though not written) evidence of Semitic languages being spoken in Eritrea and Ethiopia since approximately 2000 BC. However, the Ge’ez script later replaced Epigraphic South Arabian in the Kingdom of Aksum. This article or section appears to contradict itself.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-south-arabian-culture-important-to-ethiopia>Why was South Arabian culture important to Ethiopia?</h2>
<p>South Arabian culture [was] a foreign commodity from which the Ethiopians were able to freely pick and chose when they saw fit, rather than an entire civilization imposed by foreign rulers.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-capital-of-the-kingdom-of-aksum>Where was the capital of the Kingdom of Aksum?</h2>
<p>The Kingdom of Aksum ( Ge’ez: መንግሥተ አክሱም ), also known as the Kingdom of Axum or the Aksumite Empire, was an ancient Ethiopian kingdom that spanned what are now Eritrea, northern Ethiopia, much of eastern Sudan and southern/eastern Yemen at its peak. It was centralized in Northern Ethiopia, with its capital in the city of Aksum or Axum.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-people-of-aksum-do-for-a-living>What did the people of Aksum do for a living?</h2>
<p>The people of Aksum also raised cattle, sheep, and camels. Wild animals were also hunted for things such as ivory and rhinoceros horns. They traded with Roman traders as well as with Egyptian and Persian merchants. The empire was also rich with gold and iron deposits.</p>
