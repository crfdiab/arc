<p>do-over<br>
The basic definition of mulligan, a term most associated with golf, is a “do-over,” a second try after your first has gone awry. The second story is that the ride to Mulligan’s course in Montreal was an extremely bumpy one, and the drive in left Mulligan so shaken on the first tee that he was allowed a second shot.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-first-surety-company-in-america>What was the first Surety Company in America?</h2>
<p>150 AD: The Roman Empire developed its first laws about surety. 1837: William L. Haskins proposed the first surety company in America – the New York Guarantee Company. (Practical Guide to Construction Contract Surety Claims) 1840: The first successful corporate surety, Guaranty Society of London, was founded.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-contract-security-guards>Why are there so many contract security guards?</h2>
<p>Because of a high turnover rate, contract security guards aren’t given the opportunity to become as friendly with employees. This can affect their loyalty and commitment and adversely, to your detriment, affect their performance.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-need-a-contract-security-service>When do you need a contract security service?</h2>
<p>There may be periods of time when a company may have to add or lay off workers, which can create a security problem within a company. By using a contract security service, companies have the opportunity to deal with staffing problems easily and quickly.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-need-a-proprietary-security-company>When do you need a proprietary security company?</h2>
<p>If your company requires daily security organization that needs to be micromanaged, having day-to-day proprietary security may be the way to go. An important consideration when deciding which type of company to use is that regardless of which type of security company you select, employee turnover is a possibility.</p>
