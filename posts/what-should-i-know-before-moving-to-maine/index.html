<p>15 Things to Know Before Moving to Maine</p>
<ul>
<li>Your first fall in Maine will blow your mind.</li>
<li>Maine’s restaurant scene is booming.</li>
<li>Maine winters can be harsh.</li>
<li>Food shacks are to Maine what food trucks are to other states.</li>
<li>Maine’s state cat is the Maine Coon.</li>
<li>Maine’s population is older.</li>
<li>You’ll want to get your sea legs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=will-maine-pay-you-to-move-there>Will Maine pay you to move there?</h2>
<p>Maine. If you graduated from any college or university in the US from 2016 on, then Maine has moving opportunities. They offer a tax credit depending on graduation year and degree type that saves big on your student loans.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-maine-important-to-the-united-states>Why is Maine important to the United States?</h2>
<p>By most statistical measures Maine is an economically depressed state, yet the rugged beauty and challenge of its climate and landscape and the character of its people have given Maine an importance beyond its economic and political power. Limited economic growth has contributed to the preservation of much of its natural appearance.</p>
<h2 id=whats-it-really-like-to-live-in-maine>What’s it really like to live in Maine?</h2>
<p>Maine is the most beautiful place I’ve ever been. It can be a little lonely. Everyone’s a transplant in New York, which, I found, meant that people were pretty open to making friends. Most people that live in Portland were raised in neighboring towns and still roll deep with their elementary or high school friends.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-state-of-maine-a-beautiful-place>Is the state of Maine a beautiful place?</h2>
<p>If you have been to Maine, then you’re probably jealous. I say this with as little hyperbole and sentimentalism as I can muster: Maine is the most beautiful place I’ve ever been.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-food-like-in-the-state-of-maine>What’s the food like in the state of Maine?</h2>
<p>The Indian food is watery. The Thai food gives me a stomachache. And there is absolutely no real Chinese food, nothing even close to the peppercorn and chile-flecked delight I’d eat regularly for lunch in midtown Manhattan. It’s very white. In 2009, Maine was awarded its most humiliating honor as the whitest state.</p>
