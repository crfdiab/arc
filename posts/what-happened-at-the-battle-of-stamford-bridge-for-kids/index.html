<h2 id=what-happened-at-the-battle-of-stamford-bridge-for-kids>What happened at the Battle of Stamford Bridge for kids?</h2>
<p>The Battle of Stamford Bridge took place near the village of Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire, in England. After a bloody and brutal battle, both Hardrada and Tostig along with a large number of the Norwegians were killed. Godwinson’s achieved a complete victory.</p>
<h2 id=how-significant-was-the-battle-of-stamford-bridge>How significant was the Battle of Stamford Bridge?</h2>
<p>The Battle of Stamford Bridge was important as it destroyed the Vikings. They left with only 28 of their longships, instead of the 200+ they sailed with. One of the reasons Hardrada won the Battle of Stamford Bridge was that Godwinson’s army left their armour on their ships.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-stamford-bridge-in-fulham>Why is Stamford Bridge in Fulham?</h2>
<p>It was initially offered to Fulham Football Club, but they turned it down for financial reasons. After considering the sale of the land to the Great Western Railway Company, the Mears decided to found their own football club, Chelsea, to occupy the ground as a rival to Fulham.</p>
<h2 id=who-stopped-the-saxons-from-easily-crossing-the-bridge>Who stopped the Saxons from easily crossing the Bridge?</h2>
<p>Norse axeman<br>
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has it that a giant Norse axeman (possibly armed with a Dane Axe) blocked the narrow crossing and single-handedly held up the entire English army.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-significance-of-the-battle-of-stamford-bridge>What was the significance of the Battle of Stamford Bridge?</h2>
<p>Although often overshadowed by the Battle of Hastings, which took place just 19 days later, the clash at Stamford Bridge on 25 September 1066 is commonly seen as both marking the end of the Viking Age and paving the way for the Norman conquest of England.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-viking-army-at-stamford-bridge>How big was the Viking army at Stamford Bridge?</h2>
<p>Nearly half of the Viking army was elsewhere The invading force was made up of around 11,000 Norwegians and Flemish mercenaries – the latter hired by Tostig. But only some 6,000 of them were at Stamford Bridge when Harold arrived with his army.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-was-harold-in-the-battle-of-stamford-bridge>How tall was Harold in the Battle of Stamford Bridge?</h2>
<p>Tostig asked what his brother Harold would be willing to give Hardrada for his trouble. The rider replied “Seven feet of English ground, as he is taller than other men.” Then he rode back to the Saxon host.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-stamford-bridge-mentioned-in-the-domesday-book>Why was Stamford Bridge mentioned in the Domesday Book?</h2>
<p>An alternative explanation is given by Darby and Maxwell who state, “Stamford Bridge does, in fact, exemplify that small number of places which, though not mentioned in the Domesday Book, must have existed, or at any rate been named, in Domesday times because they appear in both pre-Domesday and post-Domesday documents.”</p>
