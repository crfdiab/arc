<h2 id=what-percentage-of-austria-is-rural>What percentage of Austria is rural?</h2>
<p>Rural population (% of total population) in Austria was reported at 41.25 % in 2020, according to the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources.</p>
<h2 id=is-austria-urban-or-rural>Is Austria urban or rural?</h2>
<p>Austria has a lower urban population (56%) than most other industrialized countries. This low rate reflects the availability of tourist related jobs in the rural areas. 98% of the population is Austrian, the official language is German, and most of the inhabitants are Roman Catholic.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a-traditional-austrian-breakfast-consist-of>What does a traditional Austrian breakfast consist of?</h2>
<p>The traditional Austrian breakfast comprises of: Semmeln (a type of breadroll; singular: Semmel); butter; coffee (not tea, although hotels these days almost always offer tea as well); muesli (often more than one kind); cold cuts (ham, sometimes smoked bacon called Speck or Schinkenspeck, cut sausages); boiled egg ( …</p>
<h2 id=is-austria-protestant-or-catholic>Is Austria Protestant or Catholic?</h2>
<p>Christianity is the predominant religion in Austria. At the 2001 census, 73.6% of the country’s population was Catholic. As of 2018, the number of Catholics has dropped to 56.9% of the population, according to data provided by the Austrian Catholic Church itself.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-austrias-national-dish>What is Austria’s national dish?</h2>
<p>Tafelspitz<br>
Tafelspitz is generally considered to be the national dish of Austria, and it a boiled beef broth which is then served with horseradish, root vegetables, spices and minced apples.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-a-rural-area-different-from-an-urban-area>How is a rural area different from an urban area?</h2>
<p>(The Census definition of an urban area is a town with a total population of 1,500 or more and therefore towns with a population of less than 1,500 are included in rural areas.) This approach does not address the underlying characteristics which might separate one rural area from another.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-rural-country-in-the-eu>Which is the most rural country in the EU?</h2>
<p>The highest proportion of people in the EU living in rural areas was 54.9% in Lithuania. In all other EU countries less than 50% of the population live in rural areas, with the lowest proportion in Malta at 0.2%.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-urban-population-and-rate-of-urbanization-related>How are urban population and rate of urbanization related?</h2>
<p>The first, urban population, describes the percentage of the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the country. The second measure, rate of urbanization, describes the projected average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the given period of time.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-definition-of-rural-in-eurostat>What is the definition of rural in Eurostat?</h2>
<p>The definition of rural applied in this instance is that adopted by Eurostat as part of its degree of urbanisation (DEGURBA) 2 classification (that indicates the character of an area). For the definition of rural for Census as used in this report see below.</p>
