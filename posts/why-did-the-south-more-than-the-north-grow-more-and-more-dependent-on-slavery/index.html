<h2 id=why-did-the-south-more-than-the-north-grow-more-and-more-dependent-on-slavery>Why did the South more than the North grow more and more dependent on slavery?</h2>
<p>Rather than industrializing like the northern states, the southern states were primarily agriculture. After the invention of the cotton gin, the southern states relied most heavily on growing cotton, again a labor intensive form of agriculture that remained profitable because of the low-cost labor provided by slaves.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-founding-fathers-not-eliminate-slavery>Why did the founding fathers not eliminate slavery?</h2>
<p>Although many of the Founding Fathers acknowledged that slavery violated the core American Revolutionary ideal of liberty, their simultaneous commitment to private property rights, principles of limited government, and intersectional harmony prevented them from making a bold move against slavery.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-slavery-prosper-in-the-south-than-in-the-north>Why did slavery prosper in the south than in the north?</h2>
<p>Slavery prospered more in the South than in the North. Many have wondered why this occurred. This happened for several reasons. To begin with, the South needed additional workers to operate their farms and plantations. Another reason they had slaves was to increase the size of their military force.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-missouri-want-to-become-a-slave-state>Why did Missouri want to become a slave state?</h2>
<p>In November 1819, Missouri requested to become a new state, one which allowed slavery. The North wanted to block the spread of slavery. They were also concerned that an extra slave state would give the South a political advantage.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-north-and-south>What was the relationship between North and South?</h2>
<p>For many years there was an uneasy alliance between the Northern free states and the Southern slave states. This was not to last for long. As more people from both the North and the South were moving west, the issue of slavery started to create problems.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-slavery-begin-in-the-united-states>Why did slavery begin in the United States?</h2>
<p>The genesis of the form of slavery that we refer to when we talk about slavery, American plantation slavery, occurred because of a confluence of economic factors. It grew to dominate two industries completely and several other partially before it was abolished. The story is generally known to have begun with cotton.</p>
