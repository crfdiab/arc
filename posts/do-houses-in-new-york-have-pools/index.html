<p>The three-story penthouse at 1110 Park Avenue comes with more than 1,700 square feet of outdoor space, including a swimming pool, a wood-burning fireplace, a barbecue and a bar. In addition to views of Central Park, the pool features a Badu SwimJet System—which creates a current to swim against—so residents can fit in a rooftop workout.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-riverside-park-apartment-building>How big is the Riverside Park apartment building?</h2>
