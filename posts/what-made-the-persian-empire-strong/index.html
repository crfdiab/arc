<h2 id=what-made-the-persian-empire-strong>What made the Persian Empire strong?</h2>
<p>The different factors that contributed to Persia’s major success as an influential empire were transportation, coordination, and their tolerance policy. Persia being accepted by those that they ruled is one of the reasons why it became successful because there weren’t many rebellions during the Persian rule.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-turkish-and-persian>What is the difference between Turkish and Persian?</h2>
<p>Persian, or Farsi, is an IndoEuropean language and therefore related – albeit fairly distantly – to English and other Western European languages. Turkish belongs to a separate language family – called, predictably, the Turkic language family – and is related to Azeri, Kazakhi, Turkmen, and a few others.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-persian-empire-referred-to-as-the-first-superpower>Why is the Persian Empire referred to as the first superpower?</h2>
<p>The first Persian Empire under Cyrus the Great soon became the world’s first superpower. He unified the empire through introducing standard currency and weights and measures; making Aramaic the official language and building roads.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-two-main-things-that-connected-the-persian-empire>What were the two main things that connected the Persian Empire?</h2>
<p>The empire was connected by many roads and a postal system. The most famous road was the Royal Road built by King Darius the Great.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-persia-changed-to-iran>Why was Persia changed to Iran?</h2>
<p>When Persia became Iran Iran was always known as ‘Persia’ to foreign governments and was once heavily influenced by Great Britain and Russia. As a cognate of the word ‘Aryan’, this name change to Iran was also a nod to the population’s Aryan race and encompassed all ethnicities in the country, not just the Persians.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-they-change-the-name-persia-to-iran>Why did they change the name Persia to Iran?</h2>
<p>To signal the changes that had come to Persia under the rule of Reza Shah, namely that Persia had freed itself from the grip of the British and Russians, it would be known as Iran. When this name change first took place, ‘Iran’ sounded quite foreign and many even failed to connect it to Persia.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-the-turks-in-the-persian-empire>What was the role of the Turks in the Persian Empire?</h2>
<p>This brings them within the Muslim caliphate, which from762 is based in Baghdad. The Baghdad caliphateis in one sense the Persian empire in a new guise. Within this empire the Turks play an increasingly important role, both as tribal allies and as slaves in Persian armies. Gradually the Turks begin to carve out territories for themselves.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-turkish-language-related-to-the-persians>How is the Turkish language related to the Persians?</h2>
<p>The Turkish language is related to Mongolian, Kazakh, and Korean. Of course, Turks did mix with Persian tribes (Tajiks, Persians) as well as Armenians, indigenous inhabitants with Celtic ancestry, Greeks, Slavs, Arabs, and South Asians.</p>
<h2 id=are-the-haplogroups-of-turks-and-persians-the-same>Are the haplogroups of Turks and Persians the same?</h2>
<p>Looking at haplogroups (y chromosomes) of both nations, it looks roughly the same. Both Persians and Turks are J2 majority. Turkey and Iran share the same R1a/R1B, G and J haplogroups in roughly the same percentages. Genetically, they are similar but the European pe…</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-people-of-iran-and-turkey-alike>How are the people of Iran and Turkey alike?</h2>
<p>The original peoples of turkey were the Anatolians which shared roughly the same genetics as Iranians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Looking at haplogroups (y chromosomes) of both nations, it looks roughly the same. Both Persians and Turks are J2 majority. Turkey and Iran share the same R1a/R1B,…</p>
