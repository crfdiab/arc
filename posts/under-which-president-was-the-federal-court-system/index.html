<h2 id=under-which-president-was-the-federal-court-system>Under Which president was the federal court system?</h2>
<p>President George Washington<br>
The Judiciary Act of 1789 established the federal court system separate from individual state courts. It was one of the first acts of the First Congress. President George Washington signed it into law on September 24, 1789.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-federal-court-established>Why was federal court established?</h2>
<p>The U.S. Courts were created under Article III of the Constitution to administer justice fairly and impartially, within the jurisdiction established by the Constitution and Congress.</p>
<h2 id=who-has-the-power-to-establish-federal-courts>Who has the power to establish federal courts?</h2>
<p>Congress<br>
Article III of the Constitution invests the judicial power of the United States in the federal court system. Article III, Section 1 specifically creates the U.S. Supreme Court and gives Congress the authority to create the lower federal courts.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-cases-do-federal-courts-handle>What kind of cases do federal courts handle?</h2>
<p>More specifically, federal courts hear criminal, civil, and bankruptcy cases. And once a case is decided, it can often be appealed.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-article-2-judge>What is an article 2 judge?</h2>
<p>In the United States, the title of federal judge means a judge (pursuant to Article Three of the United States Constitution) nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate pursuant to the Appointments Clause in Article II of the United States Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-most-federal-court-cases-originate>Where do most federal court cases originate?</h2>
<p>district courts<br>
Most cases that deal with federal questions or offenses begin in district courts, which are almost always granted original jurisdiction. District courts hear appeals cases only in the rare case of a constitutional question that may arise in state courts.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-federal-court-established-and-where>When was the Federal Court established and where?</h2>
<p>The Federal Court came into being on 1 October 1937. The seat of the court was the Chamber of Princes in the Parliament building in Delhi. It began with a Chief Justice and two puisne judges.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-main-levels-of-federal-courts>What are the three main levels of federal courts?</h2>
<p>The federal court system has three main levels: district courts (the trial court), circuit courts which are the first level of appeal, and the Supreme Court of the United States, the final level of appeal in the federal system.</p>
<h2 id=what-cases-are-not-heard-in-federal-court>What cases are not heard in federal court?</h2>
<p>Federal court jurisdiction is limited to certain types of cases listed in the U.S. Constitution. For the most part, federal court jurisdictions only hear cases in which the United States is a party, cases involving violations of the Constitution or federal law, crimes on federal land, and bankruptcy cases.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-chief-justice-of-the-federal-courts>Who was the Chief Justice of the federal courts?</h2>
<p>The Creation of the Federal Courts John Marshall was chief justice of the United States from 1801 to 1835. His decisions defined constitutional law and judicial precedent. “An act of the legislature repugnant to the Constitution is void — it is emphatically the province of the judicial department to say what the law is.”</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-power-of-judicial-review-established>When was the power of judicial review established?</h2>
<p>The power of judicial review may be traced to the famous 1803 court case of Marbury v. Madison . The election of 1800 gave that the presidency to an opposing political party for the first time.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-time-period-of-the-supreme-court>What was the time period of the Supreme Court?</h2>
<p>This period may be divided into two sub-heads: from 1861 till 1935 (the era of High Court); and from 1935 till 1947 (the era of High Court and the Federal Court). As a result of severe clash between the executive and the Supreme Court, within only seven years time the Supreme Court came to be a body disliked by all.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-creation-of-the-supreme-court>What was the purpose of the creation of the Supreme Court?</h2>
<p>Article III specifically creates only one court (the Supreme Court), allows judges to serve for life and to receive compensation, broadly outlines original and appellate jurisdiction, and outlines the trial procedure for and limitations of congressional power against those accused of treason. That’s all.</p>
