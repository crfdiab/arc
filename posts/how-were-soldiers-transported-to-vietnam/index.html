<p>During the Vietnam War, the women who served on special Pan Am flights flew into a war zone to transport soldiers. The 707 was a first-generation long-distance jet with four engines, but it could fly on just three. In an all-economy configuration, it could carry 180 GIs.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-tan-son-nhut-air-base>What happened to Tan Son Nhut Air Base?</h2>
<p>Tan Son Nhut Air Base (Vietnamese: Căn cứ không quân Tân Sơn Nhứt) (1955–1975) was a Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) facility. Following the Fall of Saigon, it was taken over as a Vietnam People’s Air Force (VPAF) facility and remains in use today.</p>

<p>The communists’ Tet Offensive of 1968 crushed U.S. hopes of an imminent end to the conflict and galvanized U.S. opposition to the war. Richard Nixon, the new U.S. president, began U.S. troop withdrawal and “Vietnamization” of the war effort that year, but he intensified bombing.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-most-soldiers-get-to-vietnam>How did most soldiers get to Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Travel to and from Vietnam was made possible by US Military Airlift Command (MAC) flights or US civilian airlines chartered by the US military. Flights were over the Pacific. Early in the war most were transported by MSTS transport ships. Later, most were air transported.</p>

<p>Cam Ranh Air Force Base is located on Cam Ranh Bay in Khánh Hòa Province, Vietnam. It was one of several air bases built and used by the United States Air Force (USAF) during the Vietnam War. As Vietnam considers the facility to be important to its defense, a small garrison of troops are stationed there.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-tan-son-nhut-become-a-military-base>When did Tan Son Nhut become a military base?</h2>
<p>In 1953, Tan Son Nhut started being used as a military air base for the fledgling RVNAF, and in 1956 the headquarters were moved from the center of Saigon to Tan Son Nhut. But even before that time, French and Vietnamese military aircraft were in evidence at Tan Son Nhut.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-us-mortuary-during-the-vietnam-war>Where was the US mortuary during the Vietnam War?</h2>
<p>The remains of four U.S. servicemen killed in the Vietnam War prepare to make the final journey home from the U.S. Army mortuary at Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon. The faces haunt him wherever he goes. Day, night, asleep, awake; the dead are unrelenting.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-americans-were-killed-at-tan-son-nhut>How many Americans were killed at Tan Son Nhut?</h2>
<p>U.S. losses were 22 killed and 82 wounded, ARVN losses 29 killed and 15 wounded, VC losses were more than 669 killed and 26 captured. 14 aircraft were damaged at the base. Over the next three weeks, the RVNAF flew over 1,300 strike sorties, bombing and strafing PAVN/VC positions throughout South Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-t-28-trojan-arrive-at-tan-son-nhut>When did the T-28 Trojan arrive at Tan Son Nhut?</h2>
<p>In October 1959 the 2nd Liaison Squadron equipped with L-19 Bird Dogs moved to the base from Nha Trang. In mid-December 1961 the USAF began delivery of 30 T-28 Trojans to the RVNAF at Tan Son Nhut. In December 1962 the 293rd Helicopter Squadron was activated at the base, it was inactivated in August 1964.</p>
