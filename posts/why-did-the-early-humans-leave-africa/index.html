<h2 id=why-did-the-early-humans-leave-africa>Why did the early humans leave Africa?</h2>
<p>In a study published today in Nature, researchers report that dramatic climate fluctuations created favorable environmental conditions that triggered periodic waves of human migration out of Africa every 20,000 years or so, beginning just over 100,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-first-men-to-leave-africa>What were the first men to leave Africa?</h2>
<p>Homo ergaster (or African Homo erectus) may have been the first human species to leave Africa. Fossil remains show this species had expanded its range into southern Eurasia by 1.75 million years ago.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-early-humans-migrate-out-of-africa>When did early humans migrate out of Africa?</h2>
<p>Homo sapiens, the first modern humans, evolved from their early hominid predecessors between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. They developed a capacity for language about 50,000 years ago. The first modern humans began moving outside of Africa starting about 70,000-100,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-early-africa>What was life like in early Africa?</h2>
<p>The commoners in Ancient Africa were typically very poor and had to work hard all their lives. Farmers – Most people in Ancient Africa were farmers. They spent much of their day working the land growing crops such as yams, sorghum, barley, and wheat.</p>
<h2 id=did-neanderthals-come-out-of-africa>Did Neanderthals come out of Africa?</h2>
<p>The ancestors of humans and Neanderthals lived about 600,000 years ago in Africa. The Neanderthal lineage left the continent; the fossils of what we describe as Neanderthals range from 200,000 years to 40,000 years in age, and are found in Europe, the Near East and Siberia.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-early-humans-leave-africa-for-the-rest-of-the-world>Why did early humans leave Africa for the rest of the world?</h2>
<p>Where there are dense populations of humans, there is a higher chance of spontaneous migration occurring. Given that Africa bore the largest density of humans, it was from Africa that humans would disperse — without any invocation of weather or food — to seed humankind to the rest of the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-need-to-move-out-of-africa>Why did people need to move out of Africa?</h2>
<p>The extensive arid environments of northern Africa and the Middle East were a major barrier blocking movement out of Africa. Before they could spread out of Africa, our ancestors needed to develop physical and mental capabilities that would enable them to survive in these harsh environments where food and fresh water were highly seasonal resources.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-leave-africa>Who was the first person to leave Africa?</h2>
<p>Homo ergaster (or African Homo erectus) may have been the first human species to leave Africa. Fossil remains show this species had expanded its range into southern Eurasia by 1.75 million years ago. Their descendents, Asian Homo erectus, then spread eastward and were established in South East Asia by at least 1.6 million years ago.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-humans-come-to-africa>When did the first humans come to Africa?</h2>
<p>(Photo: Wikimedia Commons) Modern humans emerged in Africa something like 200,000 years ago, but they didn’t leave the continent en masse until much later, giving rise to a great mystery: If they stuck around Africa for so long, why on Earth did they pick up and leave?</p>
