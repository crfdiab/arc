<h2 id=why-does-article-3-refer-to-the-court-as-supreme>Why does Article 3 refer to the court as supreme?</h2>
<p>Article III, Section II of the Constitution establishes the jurisdiction (legal ability to hear a case) of the Supreme Court. The Court has original jurisdiction (a case is tried before the Court) over certain cases, e.g., suits between two or more states and/or cases involving ambassadors and other public ministers.</p>
<h2 id=does-article-3-establish-the-limits-of-court-powers>Does Article 3 establish the limits of court powers?</h2>
<p>Article III and the Courts Article III tells us that the federal courts will hear cases arising under the U.S. Constitution. Article III tells us the specific qualifications that judges must meet to get a job in the Federal courts, including age limits, citizenship requirements, and residency guidelines.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-shortest-article-of-the-constitution>Which is the shortest article of the Constitution?</h2>
<p>It is also the shortest of the articles of the Constitution that deal with the three main branches – and has some very interesting phrasing embedded in its three short sections. Section 1 defines the basic structure of the judiciary and the requirements for judges.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-article-3-of-the-constitution-say-about-courts>What does Article 3 of the constitution say about courts?</h2>
<p>Article III of the U.S. Constitution Section 1 The Judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-last-sentence-of-article-3>What is the last sentence of Article 3?</h2>
<p>The final sentence of Article III, Section 3, has one of the most colorfully phrased sentences in the Constitution. “The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.” Well!</p>
<h2 id=what-does-article-3-of-the-constitution-say-about-treason>What does Article 3 of the constitution say about treason?</h2>
<p>The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted. Section 3 of Article III deals with the crime of treason, first by giving us a definition of the crime, then by telling us how the crime will be tried.</p>
