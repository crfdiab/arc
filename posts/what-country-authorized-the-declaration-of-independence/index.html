<h2 id=what-country-authorized-the-declaration-of-independence>What country authorized the Declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>The Declaration of Independence, the founding document of the United States, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, and announced the separation of 13 North American British colonies from Great Britain.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-helped-the-united-states-become-independent>What countries helped the United States become independent?</h2>
<p>The French decided to back the U.S. in its military efforts until the U.S. had full independence from Great Britain. After that, the treaty required France and the U.S. to work together on any peace agreement. Did you know the French helped the U.S. to win the Revolutionary War?</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-colonies-support-the-declaration-of-independence>When did the colonies support the declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>By the middle of May 1776, eight colonies had decided that they would support independence. On May 15, 1776, the Virginia Convention passed a resolution that “the delegates appointed to represent this colony in General Congress be instructed to propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent states.”</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-declaration-of-independence>Who was involved in the declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a motion in Congress to declare independence. Other members of Congress were amenable but thought some colonies not quite ready.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-states-that-signed-the-declaration-of-independence>Who are the states that signed the declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>The declaration was signed by representatives from New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-great-britain-recognize-the-us-as-an-independent-country>When did Great Britain recognize the US as an independent country?</h2>
<p>Although Spain joined the war against Great Britain in 1779, it did not recognize U.S. independence until the 1783 Treaty of Paris. Under the terms of the treaty, which ended the War of the American Revolution, Great Britain officially acknowledged the United States as a sovereign and independent nation.</p>
