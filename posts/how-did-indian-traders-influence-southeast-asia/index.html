<h2 id=how-did-indian-traders-influence-southeast-asia>How did Indian traders influence Southeast Asia?</h2>
<p>Arrival of Buddhism and impact of Indian literature (3rd century CE onward) The Mons strongly influenced by their contacts with Indian traders during the 3rd century B.C adopted Indian literature and art and the Buddhist religion. The Mons were the earliest known civilization in Southeast Asia.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-effects-of-indian-culture-in-southeast-asia>What were the effects of Indian culture in Southeast Asia?</h2>
<p>The impact of Indian culture was profound, especially in parts of Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Cambodia, and the Indonesian archipelago. Local rulers adopted concepts of state and kingship as well as urban development and hydraulic engingeering. They also embraced a script and literature in the Sanskrit language.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-southeast-asia-trade-on-the-indian-ocean>What did Southeast Asia trade on the Indian Ocean?</h2>
<p>These included Kilwa, Sofala, Mombasa, Malindi, and others. The city-states traded with inland kingdoms like Great Zimbabwe to obtain gold, ivory, and iron. These materials were then sold to places like India, Southeast Asia, and China.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-india-start-to-trade-with-southeast-asia>When did India start to trade with Southeast Asia?</h2>
<p>During the 4th century c.e. the Indian subcontinent was at a deficiency for gold due to extensive control of overland trade routes by the Roman Empire, and this period is when we see the first evidence of Indian trade in Southeast Asia. Vaishya traders had turned to maritime trade to acquire gold, and they set their sails for Southeast Asia.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-vaishya-traders-spread-indianization-to-southeast-asia>How did Vaishya traders spread Indianization to Southeast Asia?</h2>
<p>Vaishya traders had turned to maritime trade to acquire gold, and they set their sails for Southeast Asia. However, the conclusion that Indianization was just spread through trade is insufficient, as Indianization permeated through all classes of Southeast Asian society, not just the merchant classes</p>
<h2 id=how-did-india-influence-culture-in-southeast-asia>How did India influence culture in Southeast Asia?</h2>
<p>Thus, it is not surprising that Indian religious beliefs and motifs began to influence the emerging Southeast Asian societies around the beginning of the common era, resulting in the localization of many aspects of Hindu-Buddhist culture in Southeast Asia.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-trading-world-of-india-in-the-early-modern-period>What was the trading world of India in the early modern period?</h2>
<p>The Trading World of India and Southeast Asia in the Early Modern Period Denys Lombard was one of the more influential of the small band of historians who have consistently emphasized in their work the close cultural and commercial ties that have bound India and the Malay-Indonesian world over many centuries.</p>
