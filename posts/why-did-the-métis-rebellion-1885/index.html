<h2 id=why-did-the-métis-rebellion-1885>Why did the Métis rebellion 1885?</h2>
<p>It was caused by rising fear and insecurity among the Métis and First Nations peoples as well as the white settlers of the rapidly changing West. A series of battles and other outbreaks of violence in 1885 left hundreds of people dead, but the resisters were eventually defeated by federal troops.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-métis-want>What did the Métis want?</h2>
<p>Their obtrusive, aggressive ways led the Roman Catholic Métis to want to preserve their religion, land rights and culture. Neither the British nor the Canadian government had any appreciation for the Métis people. No efforts were made to ease their fears.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-métis-after-1885>What happened to the Métis after 1885?</h2>
<p>After the 1885 Northwest Resistance, many Métis were dispersed from their traditional lands to locations in the United States such as Fort Belknap or Lewiston in north central Montana and Turtle Mountain in North Dakota. Others would become the wandering nucleus of the Rocky Boy or Little Shell bands in Montana.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-in-1885-that-impacted-the-métis-people-living-in-canada>What happened in 1885 that impacted the Métis people living in Canada?</h2>
<p>1884 – 1885 Canada sends troops from central Canada to quell what the federal government perceives as an uprising, leaving many Métis dead. These dramatic events become known as the Northwest Resistance. For their roles, Louis Riel and other Métis and Indian leaders are arrested.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-causes-of-the-northwest-rebellion>What were the causes of the Northwest Rebellion?</h2>
<p>The North-West Rebellion was triggered by rising concern and insecurity among the Métis about their land rights and survival following an influx of white settlers and a decline in bison—a major food source for the Métis and indigenous peoples in west-central Canada.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-metis-resistance-in-1885>Who was involved in the Metis resistance in 1885?</h2>
<p>The Métis formed a semi-circle to attack the police on both flanks. At this time, Louis Riel led a force of Métis reinforcements. Isidore Dumont and Assiyiwin—an elderly half-blind Cree headman—moved towards Crozier’s men waving a white blanket. Joseph McKay, an English Métis interpreter, moved to meet them, with Crozier following behind.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-canadian-government-do-with-riel-and-the-metis>What did the Canadian government do with Riel and the Metis?</h2>
<p>They accepted the Metis “List of Rights” and also turned the Red River settlement into a new province which they named Manitoba.9 Riel and the Metis had been amazingly successful. However, the Canadian government also sent 1200 soldiers to the newly created province.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-metis-begin-to-negotiate-with-the-government>When did the Metis begin to negotiate with the government?</h2>
<p>In December 1884, Louis Riel drafted a new petition, which had the same principles as the preceding ones, but was more urgent in tone. The government responded in January 1885, saying it would not negotiate with Riel and would only consider the Métis’ demands if these were presented at the proper time and place.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-leaders-of-the-metis-rebellion>Who are the leaders of the Metis rebellion?</h2>
<p>Over time, their descendants developed their own culture and became known as Metis. Two Leaders: This factual story is about the Metis and two of their leaders: Louis Riel and Gabriel Dumont. Riel and Dumont were two different kinds of men. They were an odd pair with contrasting backgrounds.</p>
