<h2 id=where-did-the-idea-of-a-republic-form-of-government-come-from>Where did the idea of a republic form of government come from?</h2>
<p>The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BC.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-republic-come-from>What does republic come from?</h2>
<p>The word republic is first recorded in English 1595–1605. It comes from the Latin rēs pūblica, meaning “public thing,” characterizing that a state is ultimately run by its people—as opposed to monarchy or tyranny. For nearly 500 years, ancient Rome was a republic before it became ruled by emperors.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-a-republic>What are the disadvantages of a republic?</h2>
<p>Disadvantages of a republic government include that it requires too many people to make a decision and that it was slow to render a decision. It also occasionally resulted in dictatorship, and wealth still dictated power within republic society. The basis of a republic government is that it is ruled by the people.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-being-a-republic-country-mean>What does being a republic country mean?</h2>
<p>Republic, form of government in which a state is ruled by representatives of the citizen body. Because citizens do not govern the state themselves but through representatives, republics may be distinguished from direct democracy, though modern representative democracies are by and large republics.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-idea-of-a-modern-republic>What was the idea of a modern Republic?</h2>
<p>Modern republics are founded on the idea that sovereignty rests with the people, though who is included and excluded from the category of the people has varied across history.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-word-republic-come-from-in-english>Where does the word republic come from in English?</h2>
<p>Etymology. The term politeia can be translated as form of government, polity, or regime and is therefore not always a word for a specific type of regime as the modern word republic is. One of Plato ‘s major works on political science was titled Politeia and in English it is thus known as The Republic.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-roman-republic-first-come-about>How did the Roman Republic first come about?</h2>
<p>Q: How and when did the Roman Republic first come about? A: The Roman Republic actually went through a series of phases, which historians usually refer to as the early, mid and late Republic.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-definition-of-a-republic-before-the-17th-century>What was the definition of a republic before the 17th century?</h2>
<p>At the end… Prior to the 17th century, the term was used to designate any state, with the exception of tyrannical regimes. Derived from the Latin expression res publica (“the public thing”), the category of republic could encompass not only democratic states but also oligarchies, aristocracies, and monarchies.</p>
