<h2 id=who-controlled-the-land-north-of-the-great-lakes-during-the-american-revolution>Who controlled the land north of the Great Lakes during the American Revolution?</h2>
<p>The British controlled the land North of the Great Lakes during the Revolutionary War.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-a-lot-of-battles-fought-on-the-great-lakes>Why was there a lot of battles fought on the Great Lakes?</h2>
<p>These battles were fought between the British and the United States, during what Americans call the war of 1812. These lakes allowed easy trade to inland areas for both sides. Also, control of these lakes allowed for the ability to attack or defend cities such as Chicago, Detroit, Montreal, and Quebec city.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-north-most-great-lake>What is the North Most Great lake?</h2>
<p>Lake Superior<br>
Lake Superior, bordered by Ontario, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, is the northernmost and westernmost lake and can be considered the headwater of the system.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-geography-of-the-great-lakes-influence-the-war-of-1812>How did the geography of the Great Lakes influence the War of 1812?</h2>
<p>Still, as European settlement advanced, the area around the Great Lakes became important commercial centers for the fishing and fur trade industries. Even more important, for a military context at least, the lakes provide the most convenient supply route between America and Canada.</p>
<h2 id=who-controlled-the-lakes-near-the-end-of-the-war-of-1812>Who controlled the lakes near the end of the War of 1812?</h2>
<p>Nine vessels of the United States Navy defeated and captured six vessels of the British Royal Navy. This ensured American control of the lake for the rest of the war, which in turn allowed the Americans to recover Detroit and win the Battle of the Thames to break the Indian confederation of Tecumseh.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-war-of-the-great-lakes-take-place>Where did the war of the Great Lakes take place?</h2>
<p>It actually took place from June 1812 to February 1815. The battles themselves played out, predominantly, in the Great Lakes Region. American Boats pursued by a squadron of British warships, 18th July 1812. Photo Credit: U.S. Naval Historical Center ( Link)</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-great-lakes-important-in-the-war-of-1812>Why was the Great Lakes important in the war of 1812?</h2>
<p>Control of Lake Ontario especially granted access to the St. Lawrence River, providing a clear supply route that can guide an invader right through Montreal and up to Quebec City, the two most important cities in Canada at the time. The Great Lakes, therefore, were important objectives for both American and British war efforts during the war.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-northwest-territory-during-the-american-revolution>Where was the Northwest Territory during the American Revolution?</h2>
<p>American Revolution. The Old Northwest Territory included all the then-owned land of the United States west of Pennsylvania, east of the Mississippi River, and northwest of the Ohio River. It covered all of the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, as well as the northeastern part of Minnesota.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-battle-of-lake-erie-take-place>Where did the Battle of Lake Erie take place?</h2>
<p>After its launch, the United States did not even attempt to take back control. The most famous Great Lakes engagement, however, took place on neighboring Lake Erie, near the island of Put-In-Bay, Ohio.</p>
