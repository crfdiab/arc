<h2 id=why-is-genetic-diversity-important-for-survival>Why is genetic diversity important for survival?</h2>
<p>Genetic diversity helps maintain the health and vigor of a population to resist infectious diseases, pests and other stresses. And it better equips a species to survive in a changing environment. Many deleterious alleles are recessive and a different dominant allele would mask it so that the disease does not manifest.</p>
<h2 id=why-diversity-is-important-for-the-survival>Why diversity is important for the survival?</h2>
<p>Explanation: Increased genetic diversity leads to increased chance of species survival. Species with a limited variety of phenotypes and where all members of the species are similar to one another have a smaller chance of coping with environmental variability compared to a species with greater diversity.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-better-to-be-genetically-diverse>Is it better to be genetically diverse?</h2>
<p>The greater the genetic diversity within a species, the greater is the chance of that species to survive. Conversely, the lower the genetic diversity within a species, the lower is the chance of survival. This is because unfavorable traits, such as inherited diseases, may become widespread within a population.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-one-benefit-of-genetic-diversity-within-a-species>What is one benefit of genetic diversity within a species?</h2>
<p>It strengthens the ability of species and populations to resist diseases, pests, changes in climate and other stresses. Gene variations underpin their capacity to evolve and their flexibility to adapt.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-there-is-a-change-in-genetic-diversity>What happens if there is a change in genetic diversity?</h2>
<p>7. What happens if there is a change in genetic diversity? Explanation: The interdependence between genetic and species diversity is very delicate. Change in genetic diversity, such as in loss of species leads to a loss of biological diversity.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-diversity-important-in-an-animal-population>Why is diversity important in an animal population?</h2>
<p>Therefore to conserve genetic diversity, different populations of a species need to be conserved. – Species Diversity – this is seen at a habitat or regional level. It is important to maintain species diversity within habitats to ensure they are functioning productively.</p>
<h2 id=what-role-does-biodiversity-play-in-the-survival-of-life-on-earth>What role does biodiversity play in the survival of life on Earth?</h2>
<p>Ecological life support— biodiversity provides functioning ecosystems that supply oxygen, clean air and water, pollination of plants, pest control, wastewater treatment and many ecosystem services. Recreation—many recreational pursuits rely on our unique biodiversity , such as birdwatching, hiking, camping and fishing.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-humans-have-low-genetic-diversity>Why do humans have low genetic diversity?</h2>
<p>Human genetic diversity decreases in native populations with migratory distance from Africa, and this is thought to be due to bottlenecks during human migration, which are events that temporarily reduce population size.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-significance-of-large-genetic-diversity-in-a-population>What is the significance of large genetic diversity in a population?</h2>
<p>Genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more likely that some individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-population-size-influence-the-effects-of-genetic-drift>How does population size influence the effects of genetic drift?</h2>
<p>Small populations tend to lose genetic diversity more quickly than large populations due to stochastic sampling error (i.e., genetic drift). This is because some versions of a gene can be lost due to random chance, and this is more likely to occur when populations are small.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-genetic-diversity-help-organisms-to-survive>How does genetic diversity help organisms to survive?</h2>
<p>Genetic diversity of our plants, animals and other living organisms is what enables us to survive and thrive in this world. The capacity of species to adapt to new circumstances, whether this is resource scarcity, a changing environment or other disturbances to their natural environment, depends on genetic diversity.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-genetic-diversity-related-to-resource-scarcity>How is genetic diversity related to resource scarcity?</h2>
<p>The capacity of species to adapt to new circumstances, whether this is resource scarcity, a changing environment or other disturbances to their natural environment, depends on genetic diversity. Essentially, genetic diversity is the total number of characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species [1].</p>
<h2 id=how-are-genes-used-to-adapt-to-the-environment>How are genes used to adapt to the environment?</h2>
<p>The greater the variation in genes, the more likely is that individuals in a population will possess the differentiated genes which are needed to adapt to an environment. In scientific literature, these differentiated genes are called “alleles” and their presence is what will help species survive.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-genetic-diversity-important-for-agricultural-monocultures>Why is genetic diversity important for agricultural monocultures?</h2>
<p>Absence or low genetic diversity is also in part what makes agricultural monocultures more susceptible to disease. Many studies have also highlighted how species diversity (i.e. biodiversity) and genetic diversity are inter-linked, inter-dependent and equally important.</p>
