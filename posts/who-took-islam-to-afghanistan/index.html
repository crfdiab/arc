<h2 id=who-took-islam-to-afghanistan>Who took Islam to Afghanistan?</h2>
<p>During the 7th century, the Rashidun Caliphate Arabs entered the territory that is now Afghanistan after defeating the Sassanian Persians in Nihawand. After this colossal defeat, the last Sassanid emperor, Yazdegerd III, fled eastward deep into Central Asia.</p>
<h2 id=did-muslims-invade-afghanistan>Did Muslims invade Afghanistan?</h2>
<p>The Muslim conquests of Afghanistan began during the Muslim conquest of Persia as the Arab Muslims migrated eastwards to Khorasan, Sistan and Transoxiana. The Arabs had begun to move towards the lands east of Persia and in 652 they captured the city of Herat, establishing an Arab governor there.</p>

<h2 id=what-did-the-islamic-emirate-of-afghanistan-do>What did the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan do?</h2>
<p>Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. At its peak, the Taliban established control over approximately 90% of the country, whereas remaining parts of the country in the northeast were held by the Northern Alliance, which became the widely recognized government of Afghanistan. The Taliban provided a safe haven for Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda officials,…</p>
<h2 id=is-there-such-a-thing-as-islamic-republic-of-afghanistan>Is there such a thing as Islamic Republic of Afghanistan?</h2>

<p>The attack killed at least 10 and injured 16 others, all of which were Afghan citizens. The charity, HALO Trust, clears land mines all throughout Afghanistan.
