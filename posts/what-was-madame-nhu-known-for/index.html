<h2 id=what-was-madame-nhu-known-for>What was Madame Nhu known for?</h2>
<p>Trần Lệ Xuân (22 August 1924 – 24 April 2011), more popularly known in English as Madame Nhu, was the de facto First Lady of South Vietnam from 1955 to 1963. As Diệm was a lifelong bachelor and because she and her family lived in Independence Palace together with him, she was considered to be the first lady.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-madame-hue>What happened to Madame Hue?</h2>
<p>Madame Nhu, who as the glamorous official hostess in South Vietnam’s presidential palace became a politically powerful and often harshly outspoken figure in the early years of the Vietnam War, died on Sunday in Rome, where she had been living. She was 86. Her death was confirmed by her sister, Lechi Oggeri.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-president-kennedy-support-the-government-of-ngo-dinh-diem>Why did President Kennedy support the government of Ngo Dinh Diem?</h2>
<p>The United States supported a military government in the South and the decision of its leader, Ngo Dinh Diem, to prevent free elections which might result in the unification of the country under the control of the Communists.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-strategic-hamlet-program-unsuccessful>Why was the strategic hamlet program unsuccessful?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the greatest shortcoming of the Strategic Hamlet Program was its failure to provide the basic security envisioned by its proponents. This failure was partly due to poor placement of the hamlets.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-strategic-hamlet-program-unsuccessful-quizlet>Why was the Strategic Hamlet Program unsuccessful quizlet?</h2>
<p>Preceded by the equally ineffective Agroville Program, it failed due to poor execution, corruption, lack of protection and resistance by the relocated peasants.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-madame-ngo-dinh-nhu-and-what-did-she-do>Who was Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu and what did she do?</h2>
<p>Born in 1924 — the date is uncertain, though some sources say April 15 — she spent the last four decades in Rome and southern France. Her parents named her Tran Le Xuan, or “Beautiful Spring.” As the official hostess to the unmarried president of South Vietnam, her brother-in-law, she was formally known as Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-dragon-lady-in-south-vietnam>Who was the dragon lady in South Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Known in the media as the “Dragon Lady,” Madame Nhu made frequent public pronouncements that spawned great resentment in South Vietnam and revulsion around the world.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-hostess-to-the-unmarried-president-of-south-vietnam>Who was the hostess to the unmarried president of South Vietnam?</h2>
<p>As the official hostess to the unmarried president of South Vietnam, her brother-in-law, she was formally known as Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-correct-vietnamese-name-xuan-or-tran>Which is the correct Vietnamese name Xuan or Tran?</h2>
<p>In this Vietnamese name, the family name is Trần, but is often simplified to Tran in English-language text. According to Vietnamese custom, this person should properly be referred to by the given name Xuân.</p>
