<p>Sooner is the name first applied about six months after the Land Run of 1889 to people who entered the Oklahoma District (Unassigned Lands) before the designated time. So-called “legal sooners” had permission to enter before the designated time but nonetheless had the same unfair advantage.</p>

<h2 id=who-named-the-state-oklahoma>Who named the state Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>What does Oklahoma mean? Recorded history for the name “Oklahoma” began with Spanish explorer Coronado in 1541 on his quest for the “Lost City of Gold.” Oklahoma became the 46th state on November 16, 1907.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-boomer-mean-in-oklahoma>What does Boomer mean in Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>“Boomers” is the name used for two groups of settlers in the Southern United States in what is now the state of Oklahoma. Their belief was based on a clause in the Homestead Act of 1862 which said that any settler could claim 160 acres (0.65 km2; 0.25 sq mi) of “public land.”</p>

<p>For other uses, see Sooner (disambiguation). Sooners is the name given to settlers who entered the Unassigned Lands in what is now the state of Oklahoma before the official start of the Land Rush of 1889. President Benjamin Harrison officially proclaimed the Unassigned Lands open to settlement on April 22, 1889.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-sooners-called-the-sooner-state>Why are the Sooners called the Sooner State?</h2>
<p>The Homestead Act of 1862 provided that a legal settler could claim 160 acres of public land, and those who lived on and improved the claim for five years could receive title. People who entered the district illegally to lay claim to lands, before the designated entry time, were called “Sooners.”</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-university-of-oklahoma-get-its-nickname>When did the University of Oklahoma get its nickname?</h2>
<p>(A number of sooner claims later were contested.) In 1907, Oklahoma became America’s 46th state, and the next year the University of Oklahoma’s football team took “Sooners” as its nickname.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-word-sooner-negative-in-oklahoma-history>Is the word sooner negative in Oklahoma History?</h2>
<p>According to the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, the designation “Sooner” initially had a very negative connotation. However, the negative connotation began to change by the time of statehood, and is no longer considered negative by most residents.</p>
