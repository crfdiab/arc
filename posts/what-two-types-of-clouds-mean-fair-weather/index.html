<h2 id=what-two-types-of-clouds-mean-fair-weather>What two types of clouds mean fair weather?</h2>
<p>The two types of clouds that indicate fair weather are cirrus and cumulus. Cirrus is a type of clouds that is compared and nicknamed sometimes as the hairs of an angel because it is so thin. Unlike cirrus that appears at high altitudes, cumulus generally are formed closer to the earth surface.</p>

<p>Cumulus humilis clouds<br>
Cumulus humilis clouds usually indicate fair weather. Cumulus mediocris clouds are similar, except that they have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-clouds-predict-rain>How do clouds predict rain?</h2>
<p>If it is rows of low, dark, lumpy clouds, then the weather is otherwise okay, but watch for further developments. If there is a low, dark, grey sheet, then it’s probably raining. If it’s not, quickly go get your umbrella. If your clouds are low, fluffy, and white like cottonballs in the sky, then the weather is okay.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-clouds-are-associated-with-pleasant-weather>What kind of clouds are associated with pleasant weather?</h2>
<p>Typically, cumulus clouds are associated with pleasant weather where you can lie back on the grass and admire the sky. If updrafts become stronger, those seemingly innocuous cumulus clouds may grow taller into what we call cumulonimbus clouds.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-cumulus-cloud-a-fair-weather-cloud>What makes a cumulus cloud a fair weather cloud?</h2>
<p>Towering cumulus clouds usually indicate fair, dry conditions. The bases of these clouds form at altitudes below 2000 m. They are mostly made of drops of water. Cumulus – known as fair-weather clouds because they usually indicate fair, dry conditions.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-name-of-the-cloud-with-little-vertical-growth>What’s the name of the cloud with little vertical growth?</h2>
<p>In fact, their name depends on the degree of vertical development. For instance, scattered cumulus clouds showing little vertical growth on an otherwise sunny day used to be termed “cumulus humilis” or “fair weather cumulus,” although normally they simply are referred to just as cumulus or flat cumulus.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-clouds-are-made-of-drops-of-water>What kind of clouds are made of drops of water?</h2>
<p>They are mostly made of drops of water. Cumulus – known as fair-weather clouds because they usually indicate fair, dry conditions. If there is precipitation, it is light. The clouds have a flattish base with rounded stacks or puffs on top. When the puffs look like cauliflower heads they’re called cumulus congestus or towering cumulus.</p>
