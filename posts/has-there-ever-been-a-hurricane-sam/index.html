<h2 id=has-there-ever-been-a-hurricane-sam>Has there ever been a hurricane Sam?</h2>
<p>Hurricane Sam was the latest major hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean in recorded history, as well as the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded in the month of December. Early on December 4, Sam transitioned to a post-tropical cyclone over the central Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=has-there-ever-been-a-300-mph-hurricane>Has there ever been a 300 mph hurricane?</h2>
<p>Mexico. Cozumel was struck directly by the hurricane, as the hurricane’s wind were estimated to be above 300 mph (480 km/h). The enormous size of the storm helped to produce a storm surge of 50 feet, killing over 20,000 on the island and in the Yucatán Peninsula.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-track-of-hurricane-hazel-in-1954>What was the track of Hurricane Hazel in 1954?</h2>
<p>Hazel made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane near Calabash, North Carolina, close to the North Carolina/South Carolina state border, halfway between Myrtle Beach and Wilmington. The hurricane brought a storm surge of over 18 feet to a large area of the North Carolina coastline, producing severe coastal damage.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-date-of-the-hurricane-samuel>What was the date of the hurricane Samuel?</h2>
<p>Hurricane Samuel started when a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa, on August 19. With water temperatures of 90*F (32*C) and low vertical wind shear, the wave created a tropical depression, which intensified into a tropical storm over 12 hours while maintaining a forward speed of 10 mph (16 km/h).</p>
<h2 id=how-much-damage-did-hurricane-samuel-do-to-dominica>How much damage did Hurricane Samuel do to Dominica?</h2>
<p>In Dominica, the storm hit the capital directly, producing a storm surge of 30 feet. Over 800 people were killed all around the island. A total of 2,900 people perished around the islands. Hurricane-force winds and heavy rain caused landslides on the island. A total of 100 people perished. $500 million in damage was done.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-they-start-naming-hurricanes-after-saints>When did they start naming hurricanes after Saints?</h2>
<p>Spanish explorers adopted the word and then began giving hurricanes the names of patron saints on whose feast days the storms occurred. Later, hurricanes were identified by their longitude and latitude. In 1950, a formal practice for storm naming was first developed by the U.S. National Hurricane Center.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-hurricane-that-hit-new-york>How big was the hurricane that hit New York?</h2>
<p>The storm was, besides Typhoon Noelani in Japan, the strongest storm on record. It also was second largest, with a diameter exceeding 2,500 miles (4,000 km) when it was in the Gulf of Mexico, and about 1,800 miles wide when it hit New York City. The storm left millions dead all along the East Coast of the US, Florida, and the Caribbean.</p>
