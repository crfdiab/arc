<h2 id=what-event-lured-northern-investors-to-georgia>What event lured Northern investors to Georgia?</h2>
<p>The International Cotton Exposition – a series of three large events (1881, 1885, and 1895) established to display Atlanta’s growth and industrial capabilities and to lure Northern investment to the region.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-ivan-allen-jr-best-known-for>What is Ivan Allen Jr best known for?</h2>
<p>Ivan Allen Jr. served as mayor of Atlanta from 1962 to 1970. He is credited with leading the city through an era of significant physical and economic growth and with maintaining calm during the civil rights movement. In 1965 he persuaded the Braves to move to Atlanta from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-william-hartsfield-promote-civil-rights-in-atlanta>How did William Hartsfield promote civil rights in Atlanta?</h2>
<p>As mayor of Atlanta, William B. Hartsfield helped negotiate desegregation of the city’s businesses. He joined the Atlanta City Council in 1923, and went on to serve in the State Legislature a decade later. In 1937, he was elected mayor of Atlanta and served until his retirement in 1961.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-atlanta-called-before-it-was-called-atlanta>What was Atlanta called before it was called Atlanta?</h2>
<p>Marthasville<br>
Atlanta was founded in 1837 as the end of the Western & Atlantic railroad line (it was first named Marthasville in honor of the then-governor’s daughter, nicknamed Terminus for its rail location, and then changed soon after to Atlanta, the feminine of Atlantic — as in the railroad).</p>
<h2 id=who-came-up-with-the-city-too-busy-to-hate>Who came up with the city too busy to hate?</h2>
<p>During Allen’s administration, Atlanta was dubbed “the City Too Busy To Hate.” In the summer of 1966, Allen tried to live up to that image by going into the black inner city community of Summerhill to try to calm racial tension. In 1981, Coretta Scott awarded Ivan Allen, Jr. the Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
<h2 id=what-has-william-hartsfield-done-in-his-life>What has William Hartsfield done in his life?</h2>
<p>Hartsfield became mayor in 1936 and served a total of 23 years. He built biracial coalitions and his steady leadership navigated Atlanta through the civil rights movement, avoiding the violence that plagued cities like Birmingham. After his death in 1971, Atlanta named the airport in his honor.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-major-companies-located-in-georgia>Are there any major companies located in Georgia?</h2>
<p>This list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark taxonomy. Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct. TBC Bank in Tbilisi . Georgian Airways Boeing 737-500 .</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-largest-employers-in-the-state-of-georgia>Who are the largest employers in the state of Georgia?</h2>
<p>A household name for more than a century, Coca-Cola is one of the world’s most powerful companies and dominates the soft drink market. Coca-Cola’s company headquarters ranks as Georgia’s third-largest industrial employer, home to 4,750 employees.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-largest-cable-companies-in-georgia>Who are the largest cable companies in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Southwire Co. is one of North America’s largest cable and wire companies, producing everything from transmission cable and electronic cord products to OEM wire products and engineered products. Established in 1950, its facility in Carrolton, GA employs 2,500.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-textile-industry-located-in-georgia>Where was the textile industry located in Georgia?</h2>
<p>The locations of these factories were confined to areas in which swiftly moving waterways could be harnessed to power the mill machinery. As a result, the mills were located along the fall line, a land area several miles wide that runs along the border between the hilly Piedmont region and the Upper Coastal Plain, from Columbus to Augusta.</p>
