<h2 id=where-was-pasta-first-made-in-italy>Where was pasta first made in Italy?</h2>
<p>For those who don’t know, Genoa is a sea port in Italy. Further, the modern pasta like we know it was first described in 1154 by an Arab geographer, Idrisi, as being common in Sicily. So Marco Polo could not have brought pasta to Italy via China. It was already in Italy at that time.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-pasta-made-in-italy>Where was pasta made in Italy?</h2>
<p>While we do think of pasta as a culturally Italian food, it is likely the descendent of ancient Asian noodles. A common belief about pasta is that it was brought to Italy from China by Marco Polo during the 13th century.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-pasta-first-made-in-italy>When was pasta first made in Italy?</h2>
<p>Although popular legend claims Marco Polo introduced pasta to Italy following his exploration of the Far East in the late 13th century, pasta can be traced back as far as the 4th century B.C., where an Etruscan tomb showed a group of natives making what appears to be pasta.</p>

<p>Naples<br>
Naples becomes the pasta capital.</p>
<h2 id=is-pasta-made-in-italy-better>Is pasta made in Italy better?</h2>
<p>Italian pasta typically has strict government quality standards and control around it, and is made with 100% durum wheat, called semolina flour, or semola di grano duro in Italian. This means that not only is the pasta higher in protein, but more importantly it stands up to the rigors of cooking well.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, Genoa is a sea port in Italy. Further, the modern pasta like we know it was first described in 1154 by an Arab geographer, Idrisi, as being common in Sicily. So Marco Polo could not have brought pasta to Italy via China. It was already in Italy at that time. So how did it get there?</p>
<h2 id=where-did-pasta-come-from-before-marco-polo>Where did pasta come from before Marco Polo?</h2>
<p>There is another excellent reason why the story, attractive though it may be, should not be given much credence. This is that pasta was being eaten in Italy long before Marco Polo turned up with his traveller’s tales. There is a record dating from 1154 to the effect that pasta was being made at that date in Sicily.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-pasta-and-signor-spaghetti-come-from>Where did pasta and Signor Spaghetti come from?</h2>
<p>If pasta did not originate in Italy, and it was not introduced by Signor Spaghetti and his boss Marco Polo, then where did it come from? There are various mentions of products made from dried sheets of dough from as far back as the 5th century, with the Arabs apparently being their first users.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-pasta-di-gragnano-begin-to-travel-beyond-italy>When did pasta di Gragnano begin to travel beyond Italy?</h2>
<p>In 1885, Gragnano was the first city in Campania to gain a direct rail connection to Napoli, proof of the growing importance of this place. Finally, the last century was the era of globalization, when Pasta di Gragnano began to travel beyond Italy’s borders to the rest of the world.</p>
