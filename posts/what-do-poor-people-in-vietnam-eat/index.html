<p>Hear this out loudPausePoor and rural households consume less meat, fish, tofu, fats, and oils than the nonpoor and urban households. Therefore, the composition of their energy intake from these foods also is less than that of urban residents.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-lose-weight-eating-vietnamese-food>Can I lose weight eating Vietnamese food?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseWhile Vietnamese is an excellent weight loss diet, you also need to watch for carbs. If you eat many carbs, you will feel sluggish and it’ll convert into fat you don’t need. In some dishes – Vietnamese pho, for example – these can easily become packed with carbs in the form of noodles. Rice is also a big carb.</p>
<h2 id=is-pho-good-for-losing-weight>Is pho good for losing weight?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseThe more protein you have, the fewer carbs you’re going to consume. Pho is a great weight loss dish with the only real concern being sodium. This doesn’t make it unhealthy. A single bowl of pho can be an important part of a balanced diet.</p>

<h2 id=go-for-more-meat-and-veggies-instead-of-rice-what-is-a-typical-vietnamese-diet>Go for more meat and veggies instead of rice. What is a typical Vietnamese diet?</h2>
<p>The Vietnamese diet is usually comprised of nutrient-dense foods such as rice, vegetables and fish. Because this traditional diet is low in whole grains, it can also be low in fiber, according to the University of Washington.</p>
<h2 id=is-vietnamese-food-the-healthiest-in-the-world>Is Vietnamese food the healthiest in the world?</h2>
<p>Vietnamese cuisine focuses on preparing food with the freshest of ingredients and uses meat mainly as a condiment. It is also done with minimal use of oil and dairy and relies more on the light, fresh flavors of herbs and vegetables. As a result, Vietnamese cuisine is one of the healthiest cuisines in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-vietnamese-food-so-delicious>What makes Vietnamese food so delicious?</h2>
<p>Deriving its flavor from vegetable and herbs rather than being fried long time in oil, making it pretty light but still savory is what makes Vietnamese food stand out. Among many other ethnic cuisines making use of herbs, Vietnamese cuisine is the most outstanding for its plentiful and frequent use of many exotic and unique kinds of herbs.</p>
