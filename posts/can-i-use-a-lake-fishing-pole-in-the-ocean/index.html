<h2 id=can-i-use-a-lake-fishing-pole-in-the-ocean>Can I use a lake fishing pole in the ocean?</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, yes, you can use your lake pole for ocean fishing. But not all poles are created equally. Some will work better than others. It depends on what type of fishing you plan to do and what kind of fish you plan to catch.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-you-put-a-freshwater-fish-in-the-ocean>What would happen if you put a freshwater fish in the ocean?</h2>
<p>If we were to put a freshwater fish in salt water (or a saltwater fish in fresh water), they would fare similarly to our raisins and potatoes. The freshwater fish in salt water is now less salty than its surroundings. The surrounding water flows into their cells and they begin to swell and bloat, possibly rupturing.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-fish-in-oceans>Can you fish in oceans?</h2>
<p>Where and when can I fish in the ocean without a fishing license? Anyone 16 years and older must have a fishing license to take any kind of fish, mollusk, invertebrate or crustacean in California, except for persons angling from a public pier for non-commercial purposes in ocean or bay waters.</p>
<h2 id=can-fish-be-found-in-lakes>Can fish be found in lakes?</h2>
<p>Although we often tend to think of fish in lakes as lake dwellers, many of these species use rivers during parts of their life cycles. For example, Yellowstone cutthroat trout occupy a number of lakes throughout their range, but use rivers for spawning.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-use-freshwater-fishing-gear-in-saltwater>Can you use freshwater fishing gear in saltwater?</h2>
<p>Yes, you absolutely can use freshwater reels for some types of saltwater fishing! That’s because freshwater reels are not made to withstand the damaging effects of saltwater, nor do they usually have the size to handle the bigger fish that roam the oceans.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-use-fresh-water-hooks-in-saltwater>Can you use fresh water hooks in saltwater?</h2>
<p>It is not recommended for you to use your slimmer and lighter freshwater rods to fish in saltwater. It is not only due to the corrosive environment of saltwater fishing but also because a saltwater rod is not designed to withstand the sheer fighting power of saltwater fish.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-fish-go-in-lakes>Where do fish go in lakes?</h2>
<p>Structure causes fish to concentrate in certain areas. Lakes and ponds may have shoreline structures such as docks, logs, stump fields, brush, rock piles, grass beds, and downed trees that provide shelter, shade, and protection for fish.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-fly-fish-in-salt-water>Can you fly fish in salt water?</h2>
<p>There is an art to fly fishing, and when you mix it with saltwater prepare for fantastic strikes and unforgettable fights. Saltwater fishing is a varied experience, but you may be wondering why you would want to toss a line onto the top of the water while fishing out in the middle of the deep ocean.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-fish-that-can-live-on-land>Are there any fish that can live on land?</h2>
<p>This type of fish is special in so many ways. They can even travel on land in short distances to get back to the sea as well. Sockeye Salmon’s names are various in places. People also called them as Red Salmon, Kokanee Salmon, and Blueback Salmon. Their habitat is in the Northern part of Pacific Ocean as well as rivers discharge to the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-fish-that-live-in-freshwater>Are there any fish that live in freshwater?</h2>
<p>You can find them on the eastern coast of North America. This type of eel lives in freshwater just like the others, but they migrate to Atlantic Ocean during spawning season. A female American eel can lay up to 4 million eggs, and dies after that. People often use them as bait in fishing.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-freshwater-fish-or-ocean-fish>Which is better freshwater fish or ocean fish?</h2>
<p>In contrast, freshwater fish do not have a briny flavor and tend to have a milder flavor profile. If you are not a fan of the “fishy” taste of seafood, freshwater fish are the best choice. For example, freshwater perch is popular for homemade fish sticks and fish tacos because of its mild taste.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-fish-end-up-in-isolated-bodies-of-water-like-lakes>How do fish end up in isolated bodies of water like lakes?</h2>
<p>Leaving aside the obvious answer that humans often deliberately introduce fish to lakes and ponds, we can draw a comparison with the population of isolated islands. Just as an island may once have been connected by a land bridge, so lakes may originally have been part of river systems that dried up.</p>
