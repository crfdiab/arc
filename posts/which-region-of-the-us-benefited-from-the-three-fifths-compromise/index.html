<h2 id=what-was-the-main-idea-of-the-three-fifths-compromise>What was the main idea of the three fifths compromise?</h2>

<h2 id=when-did-the-three-fifths-compromise-take-place>When did the Three Fifths Compromise take place?</h2>

<h2 id=why-did-the-federalists-support-the-3--5-compromise>Why did the Federalists support the 3 / 5 compromise?</h2>
<p>The ratification of the United States Constitution was the subject of intense debate between 1787 and 1789. In this regard, did federalists support the 3/5 compromise? The Three-Fifths Compromise appeased Southern representatives by allowing them to count slaves for representation and taxation purposes.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-compromise-with-the-southern-states>What was the compromise with the southern states?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the delegates who strongly opposed slavery realized that pressing against it would make it impossible for the states to come together. They worked out a compromise with the Southern states. They agreed that Congress could not tax exports and that no law could be passed to ban the slave trade until 1808.</p>
