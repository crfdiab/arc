<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-evaporated-water-turns-into-clouds>What is it called when evaporated water turns into clouds?</h2>
<p>Condensation is the process by which water vapor in the air is changed into liquid water. Condensation is crucial to the water cycle because it is responsible for the formation of clouds. Condensation is the opposite of evaporation.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-evaporated-water-condense-and-form-clouds>Why does the evaporated water condense and form clouds?</h2>
<p>Together, evaporation and transpiration contribute the water vapor in the air that can eventually form clouds. Warm, moist air is less dense than the air around it, so it begins to rise higher into the sky. As more water vapor condenses into water droplets, a visible cloud forms.</p>
<h2 id=does-evaporated-water-make-clouds>Does evaporated water make clouds?</h2>
<p>Water Vapor Evaporates into the Air When air cools, it’s not able to hold all of the water vapor it once was. Air also can’t hold as much water when air pressure drops. The vapor becomes small water droplets or ice crystals and a cloud is formed.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-evaporated-water-go-up>Why does evaporated water go up?</h2>
<p>When a molecule near the surface absorbs enough energy to overcome the vapor pressure, it will escape and enter the surrounding air as a gas. Evaporation of water occurs when the surface of the liquid is exposed, allowing molecules to escape and form water vapor; this vapor can then rise up and form clouds.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-water-go-after-evaporation>Where does the water go after evaporation?</h2>
<p>Once evaporated, a molecule of water vapor spends about ten days in the air. As water vapor rises higher in the atmosphere, it begins to cool back down. When it is cool enough, the water vapor condenses and returns to liquid water. These water droplets eventually gather to form clouds and precipitation.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-clouds-formed-from-evaporation-into-the-clouds>How are clouds formed from evaporation into the clouds?</h2>
<p>It does… It’s just not very salty water. Clouds form from water vapor (water in gaseous form) present in the atmosphere, when the atmospheric humidity is close to or at 100%. However, in order for the water droplets to form, something called a cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) is needed for the water to condense on to.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-water-when-it-evaporates-in-the-air>What happens to water when it evaporates in the air?</h2>
<p>Water is evaporating, but staying in the air as a vapor. Once water evaporates, it also helps form cloud s. The clouds then release the moisture as rain or snow. The liquid water falls to Earth, waiting to be evaporated.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-liquid-water-in-a-cloud>What happens to liquid water in a cloud?</h2>
<p>liquid water. When a cloud’s temperature increases, evaporation occurs and reduces the liquid moisture A cloud can be warmed by solar radiation and longwave emission from the earth’s surface. Daytime heating increases the capacity of the air to evaporate liquid water.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-a-rain-drop-formed-from-evaporation>How is a rain drop formed from evaporation?</h2>
<p>Essentially, a rain drop (diameter roughly 2-5 mm) formed from salt will contain almost 100% water and only a microscopic amount of salt. The evaporation process “filters” it. Water is H2O. Sea water is H2O with NaCL dissolved in it and dissociated into ions Na+ and Cl-</p>
