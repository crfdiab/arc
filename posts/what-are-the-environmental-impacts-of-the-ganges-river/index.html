<h2 id=what-are-the-environmental-impacts-of-the-ganges-river>What are the environmental impacts of the Ganges River?</h2>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people and a huge range of wildlife rely on the Ganges. But pollution, dams and removal of too much water (mostly for agriculture) have affected the flow and health of this vital river. One of the river’s most at-risk animals is the Ganges river dolphin.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-human-effects-of-the-ganges-river-pollution>What are some of the human effects of the Ganges River pollution?</h2>
<p>The result of this pollution is an array of water-borne diseases including cholera, hepatitis, typhoid and amoebic dysentery. An estimated 80% of all health problems and one-third of deaths in India are attributable to water-borne diseases.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-threats-facing-the-river-ganges>What are some of the threats facing the river Ganges?</h2>
<p>Pollution, rising temperatures and excessive use via unregulated tubewells are making the Ganges’ groundwater toxic and hard to access. Less than 1/4 of the 4,800 million liters of sewage that flow daily into the river is treated.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-ganges-river-affect-the-economy>How does the Ganges River affect the economy?</h2>
<p>The Ganges basin, with its fertile soil, is a significant contributor to the agricultural economies of both India and Bangladesh. The Ganges and its tributaries provide a perennial source of irrigation to a large area, in addition to recharging the groundwater table all along their course.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-and-effects-of-pollution-in-the-ganges-river>What are the causes and effects of pollution in the Ganges River?</h2>
<p>The main causes of water pollution in the Ganga river are the disposal of human sewage and animal waste, increasing population density, and disposal of industrial waste into the river.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-toxic-pollution-of-the-river>What is the most toxic pollution of the river?</h2>
<p>1. Citarum River, Indonesia – The Citarum River is known as the most polluted river in the world and is located in West Java, Indonesia.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-live-in-the-ganges-river-basin>How many people live in the Ganges River basin?</h2>
<p>More than four hundred million people in India live in the area that feeds the river, known as the Ganges River Basin. A river basin is a region that is drained by a river, such as the Ganges, and any of its tributaries. This means that surface water and rainwater in the basin area flow into the nearby rivers.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-ecology-of-the-river-ganga>How is the ecology of the river Ganga?</h2>
<p>Thus the Ganga Basin is one of the most densely instead of river channels in the Himalaya. This has badly affected the ecological integrity of the rivers. The fast flowing pristine water of the completely been devoid of flow. The rising levels of water in different deposits which are highly fragile. The dried River Bhagirathi at Uttar Kashi.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-ganges-river-used-for-irrigation>Why was the Ganges river used for irrigation?</h2>
<p>Use of the Ganges water for irrigation, either when the river is in flood or by means of gravity canals, has been common since ancient times.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-hydroelectric-potential-of-the-ganges-river>Where is the hydroelectric potential of the Ganges River?</h2>
<p>The hydroelectric potential of the Ganges is 13 million kilowatts, two fifths of which lies in India and the rest in Nepal. The Haridwar dam diverts melted snow from the Himalayas to the Upper Ganges Canal which was built by the British in 1854.</p>
