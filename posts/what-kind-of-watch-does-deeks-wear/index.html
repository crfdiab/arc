<h2 id=how-accurate-is-ncis-los-angeles>How accurate is NCIS: Los Angeles?</h2>
<p>“NCIS LA is very realistic of what we do,” special agent Bob Milie says. All the various iterations of NCIS you see on TV hit the bullseye when it comes to portraying agents’ dedication to the job. The passion for the job and the way agents carefully investigate crimes are the same on TV as they are in real life.</p>

<h2 id=why-is-deeks-leaving-ncis>Why is Deeks leaving NCIS?</h2>
<p>On-screen, Deeks has been under serious pressure after his position of LAPD liaison officer was terminated. The LAPD furloughed him due to budget issues. And it seemed that he had no future at NCIS when he learned that he was too old to attend FLETC. But Hetty (Linda Hunt) steps in and gets him accepted to FLETC.</p>

<h2 id=is-eric-olsen-related-to-mary-kate-and-ashley>Is Eric Olsen related to Mary Kate and Ashley?</h2>
<p>No, it means they share identical genetics, like their DNA. Not sure what a “sororal” twin is, because sororal means simply… sister. So yeah, they are sororal.</p>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-watch-does-kensi-wear-on-ncis-los-angeles>What kind of watch does Kensi wear on NCIS Los Angeles?</h2>

<h2 id=why-does-nell-on-ncis-la-always-wear-tights>Why does Nell on NCIS LA always wear tights?</h2>
<p>On the other hand, tights feel slightly cooler and more comfortable to wear with that kind of climate. Practicality is key – but for Nell, this is also part of her own sense of style. As a special agent, it is assumed that she would not have too much time to dwell on what she is wearing.</p>
