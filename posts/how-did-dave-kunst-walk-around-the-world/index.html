<h2 id=how-did-dave-kunst-walk-around-the-world>How did Dave Kunst walk around the world?</h2>
<p>His walk was officially stated to be 14,452 miles (23,258 km). Kunst’s walk may not have been the first circumnavigation by foot, in particular Guinness World Records mentions George Matthew Schilling as being reputed to have circumnavigated the globe between 1897 and 1904….</p>

<p>8,300 hours<br>
QUESTION: How long would it take for someone to walk around the world? ANSWER: It is close to 25,000 miles (circumference) around the Earth. The average walking speed for most people is about 3 miles per hour. So we’re looking at 8,300 hours of walking.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-dave-kunst-walk-around-the-world>When did Dave Kunst walk around the world?</h2>
<p>In 1970, Dave Kunst of Waseca, Minnesota, started a walk around the world with his brother John. Part 1 of this story covered their travels east to New York, by plane to Portugal, and then on foot with a mule to Afghanistan where John was shot and killed by bandits. Dave was wounded and returned to Minnesota to recover in November 1972.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-would-it-take-to-walk-around-the-world>How long would it take to walk around the world?</h2>
<p>It will take a man, walking in a steady and uninterrupted pace of 3 miles per hour (mph), to walk one complete circuit around the entire equatorial circumference of the Earth in 8,300.33 hours. This is approximately 345.8 days, 49.4 weeks, 11.5 months or .95 years of steady walking in a straight line.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-walk-around-the-world-on-foot>Who was the first person to walk around the world on foot?</h2>
<p>Dave Kunst, originally from Minnesota, now from California, claims that he was “the first person verified to have completed circling the entire land mass of the earth on foot.” Kunst’s 1970-74 walk has historic importance for the modern-era of ultra-distance walking.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-dave-kunst-when-he-was-killed>Where was Dave Kunst when he was killed?</h2>
<p>John was killed when bandits shot him in the mountains of Afghanistan in October 1972. Dave was shot in the chest during the same attack, but survived by playing dead. After spending 4 months recovering from his injuries, Dave resumed his journey along with his brother Pete, from the spot where John was killed.</p>
