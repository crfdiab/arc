<h2 id=how-many-people-in-kenya-have-no-clean-water>How many people in Kenya have no clean water?</h2>
<p>There are about 40 million people living in Kenya, of which about 17 million (43 percent) do not have access to clean water.</p>
<h2 id=does-everyone-have-access-to-a-clean-water-supply>Does everyone have access to a clean water supply?</h2>
<p>Billions of people across the world lack access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. One out of every five people does not have safe water to drink, and nearly one out of every two people doesn’t have access to a decent toilet. That water was often contaminated with pathogens and disease.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-clean-usable-water-do-we-have-access-to-as-humans>What percentage of clean usable water do we have access to as humans?</h2>
<p>Even then, just 1 percent of our freshwater is easily accessible, with much of it trapped in glaciers and snowfields. In essence, only 0.007 percent of the planet’s water is available to fuel and feed its 6.8 billion people.</p>
<h2 id=who-has-no-access-to-clean-water>WHO has no access to clean water?</h2>
<p>29% of the world does not have access to safe drinking water Looking at ‘safely’ drinking water does guarantee this, although data is not currently available for all countries. It’s estimated that only 71% of the world population has access to safe drinking water. This means 29% of the world does not have access.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-have-access-to-drinking-water-in-kenya>How many people have access to drinking water in Kenya?</h2>
<p>Estimates from the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) show that 58% of Kenyans (83% in urban areas and 50% in rural areas) had access to at least basic drinking water sources in 2015.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-lack-access-to-basic-sanitation-in-kenya>How many people lack access to basic sanitation in Kenya?</h2>
<p>The total number of people lacking access to at least basic sanitation in 2015 was 32 million people. Countrywide estimates for 2015 by the JMP indicate that 30% (43% of urban and 28% of rural) Kenyans had access to at least basic sanitation, including sewerage. In urban areas an additional 27% of the population used shared latrines.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-water-crisis-in-kenya>How big is the water crisis in Kenya?</h2>
<p>Kenya’s water and sanitation crisis With a population of 50 million, 32 percent of Kenyans rely on unimproved water sources, such as ponds, shallow wells and rivers, while 48 percent of Kenyans lack access to basic sanitation solutions.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-in-afghanistan-have-access-to-clean-water>How many people in Afghanistan have access to clean water?</h2>
<p>Access to clean water. Only 22% of Afghanis have clean drinking water – and only 30% of them have proper sanitation facilities. These figures are the latest available from the World Health Organisation, which has a searchable database of every possible health indicator in the world and is the most credible source available.</p>
