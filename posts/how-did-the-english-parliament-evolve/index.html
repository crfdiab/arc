<h2 id=how-did-the-english-parliament-evolve>How did the English Parliament evolve?</h2>
<p>The first English Parliament was convened in 1215, with the creation and signing of the Magna Carta, which established the rights of barons (wealthy landowners) to serve as consultants to the king on governmental matters in his Great Council. This became the model for the composition of all future Parliaments.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-parliament-in-the-middle-ages>What was Parliament in the Middle Ages?</h2>
<p>In its earliest history ‘Parliament’, first used as a technical term in 1236, was a gathering of the same type, an assembly of prominent men, summoned at the will of the King once or twice a year, to deal with matters of state and law. So it remained for much of the 13th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-houses-of-parliament-look-like-in-1605>What did the Houses of Parliament look like in 1605?</h2>
<p>In 1605 the House of Lords met in a building originally built in the 13th century, surrounded by a number of outbuildings. When these were being demolished in the early 19th century, the doorway from which Guy Fawkes was said to have planned his escape was clearly visible.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-parliament-develop-in-the-middle-ages>Why did parliament develop in the Middle Ages?</h2>
<p>The development of parliament was driven by the monarch’s need to raise money through taxes. The real driving force behind this development was parliament’s role in granting taxation to the king.</p>
<h2 id=is-portcullis-house-part-of-parliament>Is Portcullis House part of Parliament?</h2>
<p>Portcullis House (PCH) is an office building in Westminster, London, England, that was commissioned in 1992 and opened in 2001 to provide offices for 213 members of parliament and their staff. Part of the Parliamentary Estate, the building augments limited space in the Palace of Westminster and surroundings.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-laws-of-england-change-in-1066>How did the laws of England change in 1066?</h2>
<p>castles grew up all across the country, wooden at first, and were rebuilt in stone later. Cathedrals and churches were also rebuilt in stone. The laws of Saxon England were replaced by Norman laws. Some of these were extremely strict to discourage rebellions and uprisings against the Normans.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-parliament-change-over-the-years>How did the Parliament change over the years?</h2>
<p>In this section we chart the development of parliamentary sovereignty, from absolute rule by the Sovereign, to Parliament asserting its authority over the monarchy, through to a modern democratic legislature in a technological age. The development of Parliament over one thousand years, from the Anglo-Saxon Witan to the reign of Elizabeth I</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-official-language-of-england-in-1066>What was the official language of England in 1066?</h2>
<p>England’s official language became French – and stayed that way for almost three hundred years. castles grew up all across the country, wooden at first, and were rebuilt in stone later. Cathedrals and churches were also rebuilt in stone. The laws of Saxon England were replaced by Norman laws.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-difference-between-parliament-and-parliament-in-1660>What was the difference between Parliament and Parliament in 1660?</h2>
<p>In 1660, as the 20th century historian GM Trevelyan memorably observed, it was Parliament who summoned the king. The very use of a capital P in that sentence denotes the difference: parliament had reinvented itself as more than just ‘a parliament’ – a meeting of representatives held at the king’s behest.</p>
