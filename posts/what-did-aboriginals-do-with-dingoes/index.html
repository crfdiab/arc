<h2 id=what-did-aboriginals-do-with-dingoes>What did Aboriginals do with dingoes?</h2>
<p>Dingoes helped Aboriginal people to catch small animals, often opportunistically. Aboriginal men also used them to effectively hunt large animals like kangaroo. Domestic dogs introduced by Europeans were used to hunt in different ways. Arrival of the dingo was a multifaceted driving force in Holocene dietary breadth.</p>
<h2 id=did-aborigines-have-pet-dingoes>Did Aborigines have pet dingoes?</h2>
<p>The relationship between canids and Indigenous Australians is intricate, but unique in that these peoples never domesticated the wild dingo. Neither were dingoes and dogs seen as a source of food nor in many cases considered practical hunting assistants, yet they were highly prized.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-aboriginal-name-for-dingo>What is the Aboriginal name for dingo?</h2>
<p>Dharug<br>
When “deadly” is wonderful</p>

<h2 id=are-dingoes-australian>Are dingoes Australian?</h2>
<p>The dingo is Australia’s first introduced species, but its history has been uncertain until recently. While the dingo is an introduced species, it has been in Australia long enough to become a functional part of the natural ecological system as a top-order predator.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-dream-time-like-for-the-aboriginals>What was the dream time like for the Aboriginals?</h2>
<p>Here are Dreamtime stories from Aboriginal Australia: At the beginning of the Dreamtime, the earth was flat and dry and empty. There were no trees, no rivers, no animals and no grass.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-stories-do-aboriginal-people-tell>What kind of stories do Aboriginal people tell?</h2>
<p>Aboriginal Dreamtime stories speak of events from the time of creation. These stories have been passed on from one generation to the next for thousands of years. Dreamtime stories are also preserved in our songs and dances.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-story-of-the-dingo-come-from>Where did the story of the dingo come from?</h2>
<p>The following dingo stories originate from the Yamatji (Tjupan) nation around the Mount Magnet, Meekatharra, and Sandstone in the Murchison of Western Australia. These stories were told to Lorraine Barnard by her elders about the dingo or Wunghoo. Stories written by Jeff Barnard for Nic Papalia.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-snake-people-in-aboriginal-dreamtime-stories>Who are the Snake People in Aboriginal Dreamtime stories?</h2>
<p>There are many references to snake people and lizard people in Aboriginal Dreamtime stories, a variation on the Wandjina creator belief. Known by many names, the Rainbow Serpent creator god appears in many Aboriginal creation stories. This is a term first coined by British anthropologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown in 1926.</p>
