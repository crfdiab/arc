<h2 id=what-areas-did-the-viking-explore>What areas did the Viking explore?</h2>
<p>Erupting out of Scandinavia in the eighth century AD, the Vikings dominated northern Europe, but their influence stretched as far as Russia, Asia, North Africa and the Middle East. They discovered the major islands of the North Atlantic, and set up a colony in America five centuries before Columbus.</p>
<h2 id=where-and-why-did-the-vikings-explore>Where and why did the Vikings explore?</h2>
<p>The exact reasons for Vikings venturing out from their homeland are uncertain; some have suggested it was due to overpopulation of their homeland, but the earliest Vikings were looking for riches, not land.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-place-the-vikings-explored>Where was the first place the Vikings explored?</h2>
<p>The Vikings first arrived here from Greenland in the late 10th century, led by Leif Erikson. He initially called the land Vinland (though the exact location of Vinland is disputed), because when the Vikings arrived they found grapes and vines.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-vikings-come-from-and-where-did-they-settle>Where did the Vikings come from and where did they settle?</h2>
<p>The Vikings originated from the area that became modern-day Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. They settled in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Iceland, Greenland, North America, and parts of the European mainland, among other places.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-viking-to-explore-north-america>Who was the first Viking to explore North America?</h2>
<p>By the late 10th century, some Vikings (including the famous Erik the Red) moved even further westward, to Greenland. According to later Icelandic histories, some of the early Viking settlers in Greenland (supposedly led by the Viking hero Leif Eriksson, son of Erik the Red) may have become the first Europeans to discover and explore North America.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-vikings-leave-their-mark-on-the-world>Where did the Vikings leave their mark on the world?</h2>
<p>Over the next three centuries, they would leave their mark on much of Britain and the European continent, as well as parts of modern-day Russia, Iceland, Greenland and Newfoundland.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-vikings-find-the-faroe-islands>Where did the Vikings find the Faroe Islands?</h2>
<p>The Faroe Islands were the first largely uninhabited lands in the North Atlantic Ocean that the Vikings reached in the main, westward part of their expansion. The Faroes, which jut out abruptly from the ocean, are located about halfway between northern Scotland and eastern Iceland.</p>
