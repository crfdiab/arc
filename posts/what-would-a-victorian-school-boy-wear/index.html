<h2 id=what-would-a-victorian-school-boy-wear>What would a Victorian school boy wear?</h2>
<p>The Victorian schoolboy (not those in public schools) would have worn jackets and stout trousers. On their feet they wore ankle boots, and those in short trousers wore long socks. Boys would wear a waistcoat or jumper under their jacket.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-victorian-boys-do-at-school>What did Victorian boys do at school?</h2>
<p>Typical lessons at school included the three Rs – Reading, WRiting and Dictation, and ARithmetic. In addition to the three Rs which were taught most of the day, once a week the children learned geography, history and singing.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-a-poor-victorian-boy-wear>What did a poor Victorian boy wear?</h2>
<p>The Victorian boy would also often wear a sailors suit. Poor Victorian men wore a vest, a shirt, a bow tie, coat (sometimes even down to their knees because it was bought from a 3rd or 4th hand shop and they wouldn’t try it on to see if it was the right size for them) pants, trousers, rarely shoes and a cap.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-poor-children-wear-in-victorian-times>What did poor children wear in Victorian times?</h2>
<p>Poor children wore simplified hand me down versions of outdated rich kids clothing. Boys and girls wore white gowns as infants and toddlers, graduating to suits, sailor clothes or sporty knicker outfits for boys and long or short dresses with aprons for girls.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-clothes-did-boys-and-girls-wear>What kind of clothes did boys and girls wear?</h2>
<p>Girls wore skirts and dresses, which increased in length as the girls got older. Older girls also wore corsets. Boys wore frocks, blouses, and tunics with pleated skirts at a younger age, and also wore knickerbockers and collarless jackets. Boys also wore a naval-style uniform, and different styles of the clothing changed as the boys aged.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-boys-go-to-school-in-the-victorian-era>Why did boys go to school in the Victorian era?</h2>
<p>Much of it came from a combination of cultural shifts — such as the Victorian era, which characterized a modest period with social norms — and sociological trends, such as more people going to school. Probably no school had a bigger impact on how boys dressed for school than Eton College in England.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-children-wear-to-school-in-the-1800s>What did children wear to school in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>Historically, schooling was not universal for English children; however, by the 1800s, school had finally opened to the masses. To help children from non-aristocratic backgrounds perform well in class, clothes were often donated to lower- and middle-class children so they could be more comfortable with aristocratically dressed children.</p>
