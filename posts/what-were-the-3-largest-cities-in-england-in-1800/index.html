<p>The Growth of Big Cities in England. The growth of most of the largest cities in England commenced at the onset of the industrial age in the 18th century. They experienced intense development during the 19th century, changing beyond recognition. Before the Industrial Revolution, the cities were all small towns with very low population densities.</p>
