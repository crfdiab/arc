<h2 id=what-happened-when-thomas-jefferson-took-office>What happened when Thomas Jefferson took office?</h2>
<p>When Jefferson assumed the Presidency, the crisis in France had passed. He slashed Army and Navy expenditures, cut the budget, eliminated the tax on whiskey so unpopular in the West, yet reduced the national debt by a third.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-slaves-did-jefferson-own-when-he-wrote-the-declaration-of-independence>How many slaves did Jefferson own when he wrote the Declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>600<br>
How many people did Thomas Jefferson own? Thomas Jefferson enslaved over 600 human beings throughout the course of his life. 400 people were enslaved at Monticello; the other 200 people were held in bondage on Jefferson’s other properties. At any given time, around 130 people were enslaved at Monticello.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-thomas-jefferson-do-in-1809>What did Thomas Jefferson do in 1809?</h2>
<p>March 1, 1809 Jefferson signs the Non-Intercourse Act, which effectively repeals the Embargo Act of 1807 but continues restrictions on trade with Great Britain.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-slaves-did-jefferson-own-during-his-lifetime>How many slaves did Jefferson own during his lifetime?</h2>
<p>Despite working tirelessly to establish a new nation founded upon principles of freedom and egalitarianism, Jefferson owned over 600 enslaved people during his lifetime, the most of any U.S. president. 1</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jefferson-do-in-his-two-terms-as-president>What did Jefferson do in his two terms as president?</h2>
<p>Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican who thought the national government should have a limited role in citizens’ lives, was elected president in 1800. During his two terms in office (1801-1809), the U.S. purchased the Louisiana Territory and Lewis and Clark explored the vast new acquisition.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-jefferson-and-adams-get-into-office>How did Jefferson and Adams get into office?</h2>
<p>Jefferson defeated Adams; however, due to a flaw in the electoral system, Jefferson tied with fellow Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr (1756-1836). The House of Representatives broke the tie and voted Jefferson into office.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-oldest-president-to-take-office-in-the-united-states>Who was the oldest president to take office in the United States?</h2>
