<h2 id=how-does-air-pressure-affect-floods>How does air pressure affect floods?</h2>
<p>There were two reasons for these disastrous floods: rain caused by a mass of moist air sucked into the high rocky mountains by a low-pressure system, and the steep canyon walls that this water had to escape through. The low-pressure system caused the moist air to rise, cool and rain.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-floods-get-measured>How do floods get measured?</h2>
<p>Measuring Floods Floods are measured by stream gauges that are installed in bodies of water located near populated areas. If the water level rises dramatically in a specific area, the ALERT gauge sends the warning through a satellite to be analyzed immediately.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-low-pressure-cause-floods>How does low pressure cause floods?</h2>
<p>low pressure region created by solar heating also changes latitude. This low pressure regions sees continued rise of moist wind from the sea surface to the upper layers of the atmosphere, where the cooling means the air can no longer hold so much moisture resulting in precipitation.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-scale-to-measure-floods>Is there a scale to measure floods?</h2>
<p>The Flood Magnitude value is a measure of “how severe” a flood is, as a strictly hydrological occurrence (no assessment of damage is implied). “0” is the smallest reported value (discharge is below the 1.5 y recurrence interval discharge; no flooding).</p>
<h2 id=what-front-causes-floods>What front Causes floods?</h2>
<p>This process, called frontal overrunning, produces clouds and rains north of the frontal boundary. Heavy rain and thunderstorms can develop north of the surface frontal position. days, the rain accumulated can lead to local flash flooding or even widespread flooding.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-high-air-pressure-affect-the-weather>How does high air pressure affect the weather?</h2>
<p>High air pressure produces clear sky, dry and stable weather. In a low pressure zone, wind is circulated inwards and upwards rapidly. As a result, air rises and cools; clouds and precipitate are formed.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-force-of-flood-water>How big is the force of flood water?</h2>
<p>Let’s lay out some impressive facts about floodwater. Six inches of flowing water can knock a person off their feet. Water flowing at 7 mph has the equivalent force per unit area as air blowing at EF5 tornado wind speeds. Water moving at 25 mph has the pressure equivalent of wind blowing at 790 mph, faster than the speed of sound.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-air-flow-in-a-high-pressure-system>Where does the air flow in a high pressure system?</h2>
<p>Air near the surface flows down and away in a high pressure system (left) and air flows up and together at a low pressure system (right).</p>
<h2 id=how-much-pressure-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-atmosphere>How much pressure is at the bottom of the atmosphere?</h2>
<p>We live at the bottom of the atmosphere, and the weight of all the air above us is called air pressure. Above every square inch on the surface of the Earth is 14.7 pounds of air. That means air exerts 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi) of pressure at Earth’s surface.</p>
