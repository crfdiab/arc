<p>White women and children were left to fend for themselves, and many became widows and orphans when one in five Confederate soldiers died. In the countryside, armies destroyed and appropriated property, seized food, burned fences, and turned houses into hospitals.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-the-battle-of-vicksburg>What impact did the battle of Vicksburg?</h2>
<p>It cut off the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas from the rest of the Confederate States, effectively splitting the Confederacy in two for the duration of the war. The Union victory also permanently severed communication between the Trans-Mississippi Department and the balance of the Confederacy.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-eat-during-the-siege-of-vicksburg>What did people eat during the Siege of Vicksburg?</h2>
<p>To protect themselves from the bombardments, civilians dug caves into the hills in the city, cooking outside the entrances to their caves when the shelling was light. Foods commonly eaten in these makeshift shelters included rice and “coffee” brewed from sweet potatoes.</p>
<h2 id=what-problems-did-the-confederates-face-on-the-homefront>What problems did the Confederates face on the homefront?</h2>
<p>Poverty and poor relief, especially in times of acute food shortages, were major challenges facing Virginia and Confederate authorities during the American Civil War (1861–1865). At first, most Confederates were confident that hunger would not be a problem for their nation.</p>

<h2 id=how-many-civilians-died-during-the-siege-of-vicksburg>How many civilians died during the Siege of Vicksburg?</h2>
<p>The caves were very successful at protecting Vicksburg’s residents from the shells and minie balls being fired into the city – less than 20 civilians can be documented as being killed during the siege.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-union-artillery-fire-at-vicksburg>Where did the Union artillery fire at Vicksburg?</h2>
<p>They literally had to face incoming fire from all directions – Union artillery shells from the siege lines outside the city often skimmed over the Confederate earthworks and slammed into the city. The Union navy also fired thousands of rounds of artillery into Vicksburg from the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>While the fighting raged on the front lines, the civilians trapped in Vicksburg were learning firsthand the horrors of war.
