<h2 id=what-is-a-double-bed-in-europe>What is a double bed in Europe?</h2>
<p>In Europe a double bed is either 4ft 6 or 5ft wide. In the US you would call it a Queen or King. It usually means one bed but can on occasion be 2 beds put together though this is more unusual.</p>
<h2 id=is-single-and-twin-bed-the-same>Is single and twin bed the same?</h2>
<p>Single and twin are two terms for the same bed size. There is no difference between the two, and both terms are often used interchangeably. “Single” used to be the more popular terminology, but today, “twin” is more commonly used.

<h2 id=what-does-double-room-king-bed-mean>What does double room king bed mean?</h2>
<p>double occupancy room<br>
In hotel terminology a double king room means, a double occupancy room (for 2 people) with a king bed. It means ONE king size bed and double occupancy as in two people.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-european-bed-sizes>What are European bed sizes?</h2>
<p>European Sizes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>European Single. 90cm x 200cm / 3′ x 6’6″ Euro Single. The same width as a standard UK single size, but slightly longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>European Double. 140cm x 200cm / 4’9 x 6’6″ Euro Double. Slightly wider and slightly longer than a standard UK double mattress.</p>
</li>

<h2 id=european-king-160cm-x-200cm--53-x-66-euro-king-is-a-double-bed-the-same-as-a-queen-in-europe>European King. 160cm x 200cm / 5’3 x 6’6″ Euro King. Is a double bed the same as a queen in Europe?</h2>
<p>A U.S. full or double bed (54″ x 75″ or 137 x 191 cm) is similar to UK/Ireland’s double bed (54″ x 75″ or 137 x 191 cm) and European 140 x 200 cm (55″ x 79″). A U.S. queen (60″ x 80″ or 152 x 203 cm) is equivalent to UK/Ireland’s king size (60″ x 78″ or 152 x 198 cm) and Europe’s 160 x 200 cm (63″ x 79″).</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-mattress-smaller-than-a-twin>Is there a mattress smaller than a twin?</h2>
<p>Is There a Mattress Smaller Than a Twin? A twin, also known as a single mattress, is the smallest size available on the market today. Casper twin mattresses are 38 inches by 75 inches and are the perfect size for a child or short single sleeper.</p>
<h2 id=do-2-twins-make-a-king>Do 2 Twins make a king?</h2>
<p>Twin XLs are just as long as a king and queen mattress but half as wide. When you combine two twin XL mattresses, you get the exact same size as a king bed — 76 by 80 inches — with the freedom to opt for two different mattress types.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-twin-beds-in-european-hotel-rooms>Are there twin beds in European hotel rooms?</h2>
<p>I Don’t Understand European Hotel Twin Beds! Generally speaking you have better chances of an upgrade when booking a room with one bed, since that’s the configuration of most suites/premium rooms</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-double-room-and-a-twin-room>What’s the difference between a double room and a twin room?</h2>
<p>Unlike the double room, the twin room has twin beds that may be also called as single beds. But in double room, there is only one single bed. In twin room, the beds are separate where as in double there is no separation of the bed.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-have-two-beds-in-a-twin-room>Can you have two beds in a twin room?</h2>
<p>A twin room will give you two, separate “twin-sized” beds. They aren’t very wide, but are long enough for most people. Depending on the size of the room, the beds might be very close together – as in right next to each other – so it’s best to search for photos.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-a-twin-size-bed-in-europe>How big is a twin size bed in Europe?</h2>
<p>Generally, there are equivalents for American sizes in Europe, although they are rough. A U.S. twin bed is 39″ x 75″ (97 x 191 cm), which roughly compares with UK/Ireland’s single (36″ x 75″ or 91 x 191 cm) and continental European 90 x 200 cm (35″ x 79″). A U.S. full or double bed (54″ x 75″ or 137 x 191 cm) is similar to UK/Ireland’s double…</p>
