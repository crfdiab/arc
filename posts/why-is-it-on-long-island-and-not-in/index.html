<h2 id=why-is-it-on-long-island-and-not-in>Why is it on Long Island and not in?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseThe Reason Long Island Isn’t Considered an Island In 1985, all nine justices on the Supreme Court agreed. Long Island, that mass of land completely surrounded by water, is not an island. It’s a peninsula. According to the ruling, Long Island’s north shore follows the south shore of the opposite mainland.</p>
<h2 id=is-long-island-a-bad-place-to-live>Is Long Island a bad place to live?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseIn fact, Long Island is one of the most expensive places to live in the United States beating out New York City. It costs a family of four around $140,000 just to get by comfortably. Taxes, of course, are what make the bulk of expenses, followed by housing, transportation, and health care.</p>
<h2 id=why-people-are-leaving-long-island>Why people are leaving Long Island?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseThe majority of the relocated are young people like ourselves who just couldn’t afford to stay any longer. So, to answer your question: it was the unreasonably high cost of living, the traffic and the expensive LIRR commute that caused me to dislike living on Long Island.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-worth-living-on-long-island>Is it worth living on Long Island?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseRated One of the Best Places to Live in America Oyster Bay and Huntington made it to the top 50 most livable towns in the US, rated by Money Magazine – and for good reason. Oyster Bay and a number of other towns within Long Island itself are home to a range of excellent schools.</p>
<h2 id=is-living-in-long-island-boring>Is living in Long Island boring?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseBoring, expensive, riddled with crime and drugs. Crime rates and drug use has also steadily increased over the years, making the island relatively unsafe in certain areas.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-so-many-people-moving-to-long-island>Why are so many people moving to Long Island?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseBeing just a short drive away from major business centers, Long Island is a good choice for commuters as well. As it turns out, this is one of the reasons why people move to Long Island – they are close enough to all important spots and far enough from the big city hustle and bustle.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-whitest-town-on-long-island>What is the whitest town on Long Island?</h2>
<table><tr><th>Sayville, New York</th></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>State</td><td>New York</td></tr><tr><td>County</td><td>Suffolk</td></tr><tr><td>Area</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-do-people-want-to-live-on-long-island>Why do people want to live on Long Island?</h2>
<p>There are the obvious reasons like the beaches, its close proximity to New York City without having to feel like you’re living in the hustle and bustle of it, the four changing seasons, and then there are the things you probably didn’t know about the Island.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-live-on-long-island-or-in-a-borough>Do you live on Long Island or in a borough?</h2>
<p>Generally you live on an island but in a jurisdiction. So if Long Island were a town or borough or other political entity, it would be ambiguous, but that isn’t the case today. Not the answer you’re looking for?</p>
<h2 id=can-a-family-move-out-to-long-island>Can a family move out to Long Island?</h2>
<p>It is not uncommon for families to move out to Long Island, pay off their mortgage, and then need to move back to the city because they couldn’t afford the property taxes on their home. When you live here, then you’ll know almost all of your expenses upfront.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-good-to-live-in-new-york-city>Is it good to live in New York City?</h2>
<p>Living in New York City can be one of the best experiences in life. It can also become a problem if you choose to live in the wrong location for your lifestyle. Two of the most popular choices today for settling into an NYC way of life are Manhattan and Long Island.</p>
