<h2 id=what-do-i-call-my-brother-in-law>What do I call my brother-in-law?</h2>
<p>More commonly a sibling-in-law is referred to as a brother-in-law for a male sibling-in-law, and a sister-in-law for a female one. Sibling-in-law also refers to the reciprocal relationship between a person’s spouse and their sibling’s spouse.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-correct-to-say-brother-in-laws>Is it correct to say brother in laws?</h2>
<p>The plural of brother-in-law is brothers-in-law because the base noun is made plural. However, when forming possessives, the compound noun is considered as a unit. Hence the singular possessive brother-in-law’s and the (awkward) plural possessive brothers-in-law’s.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-english-of-balae>What is the English of Balae?</h2>
<p>translations balae en A woman’s child’s mother-in-law.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-marry-your-sisters-husbands-sister>Can you marry your sisters husbands sister?</h2>
<p>You certainly can. I am assuming that your sister’s sister-in-law is not your brother’s wife, which, while such a union would be legal and genetically sound once their divorce was final, would not be a very nice thing to do. However, marriage to your sister’s husband’s or wife’s sister, would be wonderful!</p>
<h2 id=can-2-brothers-marry-2-sisters>Can 2 brothers marry 2 sisters?</h2>
<p>Double Cousins A double cousinship occurs only when a set of siblings marries another set of siblings and both have children. This could be two sisters marrying two brothers. In your case, this is a brother and sister marrying a sister and brother. Double cousins actually share the same gene pool as siblings.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-say-brother-in-law-in-english>How do you say brother-in-law in English?</h2>

<h2 id=who-is-a-son-in-law>Who is a son in law?</h2>
<p>: the husband of one’s daughter or son.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-a-co-sister>Who is a co sister?</h2>
<p>co-sister. plural. co-sisters. DEFINITIONS1. the wife of your husband’s brother.</p>

<p>“It is a humbling experience to come here and spend time listening to instruction,” Brother Swingle said, adding: “You go away from here much better equipped to magnify Jehovah.”</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-family-terms-in-tagalog>What are the names of the family terms in Tagalog?</h2>

<h2 id=what-are-the-tagalog-terms-for-great-grandparents>What are the Tagalog terms for great grandparents?</h2>
<p>The Tagalog terms include the great uncles and the great aunts from British and American English. Likewise, the Tagalog terms for great grandparents, lolo sa tuhod and lola sa tuhod, includes their brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-a-cousin-in-tagalog>What do you call a cousin in Tagalog?</h2>
<p>Any kind of cousin, once removed, is called the same thing as a niece or nephew, pamangking. Which reminds me… There are three words that are so close to being pronounced the same, most Tagalog speakers only use one of them.</p>
