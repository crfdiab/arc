<p>Examples of deep-sea gigantism include the big red jellyfish, the giant isopod, giant ostracod, the giant sea spider, the giant amphipod, the Japanese spider crab, the giant oarfish, the deepwater stingray, the seven-arm octopus, and a number of squid species: the colossal squid (up to 14 m in length), the giant squid …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-largest-creature-to-ever-live>What is the largest creature to ever live?</h2>
<p>blue whale<br>
Far bigger than any dinosaur, the blue whale is the largest known animal to have ever lived. An adult blue whale can grow to a massive 30m long and weigh more than 180,000kg – that’s about the same as 40 elephants, 30 Tyrannosaurus Rex or 2,670 average-sized men.</p>
<h2 id=what-living-thing-live-in-the-ocean>What living thing live in the ocean?</h2>
<p>The variety and number of invertebrates, animals without a backbone, is truly remarkable. Marine invertebrates include sea slugs, sea anemones, starfish, octopi, clams, sponges, sea worms, crabs, and lobsters. Most of these animals are found close to the shore, but they can be found throughout the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=is-blue-whale-bigger-than-megalodon>Is blue whale bigger than Megalodon?</h2>
<p>A blue whale can grow to up to five times the size of a megalodon. Blue whales reach a maximum length of 110 feet, which is far larger than even the biggest meg. Blue whales also weigh significantly more compared to the megalodon.</p>

<p>Alan Weir / Flickr / CC BY 2.0 While the blue whale is the overall-largest king of the sea, the lion’s mane jellyfish goes to the top of the list for being the longest. And as the longest medusozoa of all, these languid beauties have tentacles that reach an astonishing 120 feet in length.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-biggest-fish-in-the-ocean>Which is the biggest fish in the ocean?</h2>
<p>Thanks for signing up for Ocean Conservancy emails. Whale sharks are the biggest fish in the world and can grow up to 40 feet long and weigh up to 20,000 pounds. That is as tall as two giraffes stacked on top of each other and the weight of two elephants combined! Whale sharks are gentle giants.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-biggest-animal-in-the-world>Which is the biggest animal in the world?</h2>
<p>Most of us have seen photos of a glorious, gigantic blue whale. The blue whale is the largest animal ever known to have existed — even out-sizing dinosaurs. They weigh up to 441,000 pounds. Their hearts are the size of a car; its beat can be detected from two miles away.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-biggest-whale-on-earth>How big is the biggest whale on Earth?</h2>
<p>How Big Is a Blue Whale. Blue whales are thought to be the largest animal ever to live on the Earth. They reach lengths up to about 100 feet and weights of an amazing 100-150 tons.</p>
