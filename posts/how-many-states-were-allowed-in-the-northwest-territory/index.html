<h2 id=how-many-states-were-allowed-in-the-northwest-territory>How many states were allowed in the Northwest Territory?</h2>
<p>Also known as the Ordinance of 1787, the Northwest Ordinance established a government for the Northwest Territory, outlined the process for admitting a new state to the Union, and guaranteed that newly created states would be equal to the original thirteen states.</p>
<h2 id=which-areas-of-the-northwest-territory-were-settled-first>Which areas of the Northwest Territory were settled first?</h2>
<p>In 1820, prices and farm sizes were reduced until eighty acres could be purchased at $1.25 per acre. Congress surveyed Ohio land over a period of thirty years. This territory was the first region of the Northwest Territory to be settled because it was nearest to the older settlements.</p>
<h2 id=what-state-joined-the-northwest-territory-first>What state joined the Northwest Territory first?</h2>
<p>Ohio<br>
The first state to be formed from the Northwest Territory was Ohio, the seventeenth state of the United States of America. While the United States government had now established how the Northwest Territory would be governed, American Indians living in the area did not consent to American control of the region.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-old-northwest-territory-of-the-united-states>Where was the Old Northwest Territory of the United States?</h2>
<p>The Old Northwest Territory included all the then-owned land of the United States west of Pennsylvania, east of the Mississippi River, and northwest of the Ohio River.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-provinces-of-the-northwest-territories>What are the provinces of the Northwest Territories?</h2>
<p>The creation in 1999 of the territory of Nunavut out of the eastern portion of the Northwest Territories reduced the area of the latter by more than half. The Northwest Territories are bordered by Nunavut to the east, the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia to the south, and Yukon to the west.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-integration-of-the-northwest-territory>What was the integration of the Northwest Territory?</h2>
<p>Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Integration of the Northwest Territory into a political unit, and settlement, depended on three factors: relinquishment by the British, extinguishment of states’ claims west of the Appalachians, and usurpation or purchase of lands from the Indians.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-people-in-the-old-northwest-territory>Who are the people in the Old Northwest Territory?</h2>
<p>In the 1780s, there were far more British citizens here than Americans. The vast wilderness was also populated by Indians including the Delaware, Miami, Potawatomi, Shawnee, and others.</p>
