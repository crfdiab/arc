<h2 id=what-caused-the-nobles-to-fight-back-against-king-john>What caused the nobles to fight back against King John?</h2>
<p>King John vs. While King John carried on his dispute with the Pope, powerful English landowners called barons conspired against him. Fuming over John’s heavy taxes and other abuses of power, the barons plotted rebellion.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-at-runnymede-with-king-john-and-the-nobles>What happened at Runnymede with King John and the nobles?</h2>
<p>On June 15, 1215, John met the barons at Runnymede on the Thames and set his seal to the Articles of the Barons, which after minor revision was formally issued as Magna Carta. In immediate terms, Magna Carta was a failure—civil war broke out the same year, and John ignored his obligations under the charter.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-the-nobles-especially-unhappy-with-john-in-1215>Why were the nobles especially unhappy with John in 1215?</h2>
<p>Why were the nobles especially unhappy with John in 1215? He raised the taxes on the barons to pay for soldiers to invade France.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-barons-rebel-against-king-john-in-1215>Why did the barons rebel against King John in 1215?</h2>
<p>In 1215, unhappy with King John’s greed, cruelty and his unwillingness to abide by the terms of the magna carta, the English barons rebelled and invited Prince Louis of France to come and be king of England. Louis met with little initial resistance quickly moved through Kent.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-runnymede-chosen-for-the-magna-carta>Why was Runnymede chosen for the Magna Carta?</h2>
<p>Was it a good choice? Runnymede is situated close to the Roman river crossing at Staines where King John’s barons were residing during the Magna Carta negotiations while he was at Windsor Castle. By using this crossing, the barons would have had direct access to the bank opposite the meadow, perhaps suggesting a fixed location for the agreements.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-king-john-spend-his-time-at-runnymede>Where did King John spend his time at Runnymede?</h2>
<p>King John’s advisors included the Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton, and a number of other loyal clerics and barons. The King himself did not spend the whole time at Runnymede; he spent the nights at the nearby castle of Windsor.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-england-in-1215>Who was the King of England in 1215?</h2>
<p>Led by Baron Robert Fitzwalter, they marched on London calling themselves the “army of God”. Armed and ready, they gathered a huge force of nobles at the town of Runnymede. They brought the king there. The archbishop read aloud to the king from a parchment he held, a parchment called the Magna Carta, the Great Charter.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-magna-carta-affect-king-john>How did the Magna Carta affect King John?</h2>
<p>How did the Magna Carta affect the king’s power? The Magna Carta was signed by King John in June 1215 and was the first document to impose legal limits on the king’s personal powers. Clause 61 stated that a committee of twenty five barons could meet and overrule the will of the king —a serious challenge to John’s authority as ruling monarch.</p>
