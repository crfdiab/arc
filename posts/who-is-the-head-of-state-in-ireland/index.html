<h2 id=who-is-the-head-of-state-in-ireland>Who is the head of State in Ireland?</h2>
<p>The President of Ireland (Irish: Uachtarán na hÉireann) is the head of state of Ireland and the Supreme Commander of the Irish Defence Forces. The president holds office for seven years, and can be elected for a maximum of two terms.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-taoiseach-of-ireland-have-to-resign>When does the Taoiseach of Ireland have to resign?</h2>
<p>The Taoiseach is required to resign if he has “ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Eireann,” unless he asks the president to dissolve the Dáil. The president has the right to refuse such a request, in which case the Taoiseach must resign immediately.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-members-of-the-central-bank-of-ireland>Who are the members of the Central Bank of Ireland?</h2>
<p>The president appoints, on the advice of the government, the Senior Professors and chairman of the council of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies; the governor of the Central Bank of Ireland; the members of the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal; the Ombudsman; and the members of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.</p>

<h2 id=who-is-the-candidate-for-president-of-ireland>Who is the candidate for president of Ireland?</h2>
<p>Dana, it turns out, is an American citizen, which seems a little odd for someone who wants to be an Irish president. The Sinn Fein candidate Martin McGuinness faced even more questions last week about his IRA past and is still not answering any of them.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-most-powerful-person-in-ireland>Who is the most powerful person in Ireland?</h2>
<p>The president is the first citizen of Ireland, and the Constitution says he or she takes “precedence over all other persons in the state.” That much is clear. Does this mean the president is the most powerful person in the country? Certainly not. The role is mainly ceremonial and symbolic.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-president-of-ireland-resign-after-taking-office>Can a president of Ireland resign after taking office?</h2>
<p>A President certainly has the power to resign immediately after taking office but, beyond that, many of the other highly-publicised promises made by prospective candidates simply go beyond the scope of the powers of the office. The President of Ireland is the Head of State, not the Head of Government.</p>
