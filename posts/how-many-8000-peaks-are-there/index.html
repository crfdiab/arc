<p>14<br>
The eight-thousanders are the 14 independent mountains on Earth that are more than 8,000 metres (26,247 ft) high above sea level.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-peaks-in-the-world-are-above-8000-meters>How many peaks in the world are above 8000 meters?</h2>
<p>14 peaks<br>
Only 14 peaks in the world raise up over 8000m into what today is known as “the dead zone”. All are situated in the Himalaya range spread over countries like: Nepal, India, Pakistan and Tibet.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-of-the-highest-peaks-in-the-world-are-over-8000-metres-26247-ft->How many of the highest peaks in the world are over 8000 Metres 26247 ft )?</h2>
<p>14 mountains<br>
There are 14 mountains over 8,000 metres (26,247 ft), which are often referred to as the Eight-thousanders. All are in the two highest mountain ranges in the world, the Himalayas and the Karakoram.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-easiest-8000-meter-peak-to-climb>What is the easiest 8000 meter peak to climb?</h2>
<p>Cho Oyu is the world’s sixth highest mountain and considered to be the easiest of the fourteen 8,000m peaks. As with all ascents at high altitude, the climbing is strenuous and a high standard of fitness is required, but as a peak to experience the thin air at 8,000m for the first time, Cho Oyu is ideal.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-hardest-8000-meter-peak-to-climb>What is the hardest 8000 meter peak to climb?</h2>
<p>Annapurna Massif<br>
Since its first ascent on the 1950 expedition led by Maurice Herzog, Annapurna Massif in Nepal has been climbed by more than almost 300 people, but at least 73 have died trying. This high fatality rate makes Annapurna, the 10th highest mountain in the world, the most statistically dangerous of the 8,000-meter peaks.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-most-difficult-8000-meter-peak>What is the most difficult 8000 meter peak?</h2>
<p>The extremely steep south face, a wall of rock that rises 3,000 meters (9,800 feet), is said to be one of the most difficult climbs in the world. Annapurna is the only 8,000 meter-peak to be conquered on the first try—and Herzog and Lachenal did it without bottled oxygen. However, the feat came with a high price.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-annapurna-so-dangerous>Why is Annapurna so dangerous?</h2>
<p>One of the reasons why is Annapurna so deadly is because of its unpredictable climate. Annapurna remains cold and covered with snow throughout the year, on top of that, it can receive high velocity wind and snowfall in any season, which makes climbing the mountain tough for the climbers.</p>

<h2 id=how-tall-are-the-14-highest-mountains-in-the-world>How tall are the 14 highest mountains in the world?</h2>
<p>The world’s 14 highest mountains are an exclusive club of peaks whose summits tower more than 8,000 meters (26,247 feet) above sea level. These mountains, besides their highest main summit, also have 22 subsidiary summits, many of which have not been climbed. The Eight-Thousanders all lie in the lofty Himalayan and Karakoram ranges in central Asia.</p>

<p>Reinhold Messner was the 1st person to climb all 14 of the 8000 meter peaks. At 42-years-old, Messner accomplished the task in 16 years from 1970 to 1986. How many of the 8000 meter peaks have you climbed or skied? If you could climb any of them, which one would you climb first? Tell us in the comments below.</p>
