<h2 id=what-was-happening-in-vietnam-in-1964>What was happening in Vietnam in 1964?</h2>
<p>In early August 1964, two U.S. destroyers stationed in the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam radioed that they had been fired upon by North Vietnamese forces. In response to these reported incidents, President Lyndon B. Johnson requested permission from the U.S. Congress to increase the U.S. military presence in Indochina.</p>
<h2 id=was-laos-a-part-of-vietnam>Was Laos a part of Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Laos was a key part of the Vietnam War since parts of Laos were invaded and occupied by North Vietnam for use as a supply route for its war against South Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-us-get-involved-in-laos>Why did the US get involved in Laos?</h2>
<p>The U.S. aim as the war went on basically became: use Laos as a charnel house, where most of the reason for the fight was to occupy North Vietnamese Army and to kill as many North Vietnamese as possible — the theory being that then, they could not be involved in the fight in Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-soldiers-were-in-vietnam-in-1964>How many soldiers were in Vietnam in 1964?</h2>
<table><tr><th>1964 in the Vietnam War</th></tr><tr><th>← 1963 1965 →</th></tr><tr><td>Strength</td></tr><tr><td>US: 23,310 (31 Dec 1964) South Vietnam: 514,000 (includes militia)</td><td>PAVN/VC:100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Casualties and losses</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-did-the-us-get-involved-in-vietnam-go-beyond-the-events-of-1964>Why did the US get involved in Vietnam go beyond the events of 1964?</h2>
<p>Johnson’s anxieties about U.S. credibility, combined with political instability in Saigon, China’s resistance to negotiations, and Hanoi’s refusal to remove troops from South Vietnam and stop aiding the National Liberation Front led him to escalate the U.S. military presence in Vietnam from 1964 through 1967.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-us-fear-would-happen-if-it-did-not-get-involved-in-vietnam>What did the US fear would happen if it did not get involved in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Some Americans questioned the fairness of the draft because? What did the United States fear would happen if it did not get involved in Vietnam? Communists would take over. What congressional action gave President Johnson the authority to escalate the Vietnam War?</p>
<h2 id=is-laos-a-us-ally>Is Laos a US ally?</h2>
<p>The United States established full diplomatic relations with Laos in 1955, following its full independence from France in 1954. Within a few years, Laos entered into a civil war, and the United States supported the country’s royalist government.</p>
<h2 id=is-vietnam-an-ally-of-the-us>Is Vietnam an ally of the US?</h2>
<p>Vietnam is now regarded as America’s closest ally in Southeast Asia, while Washington regularly goes out of its way to champion Hanoi and improve its international standing. In 1991, Vietnam’s communist government opened a POW/MIA office in Hanoi, while American tourists were allowed to enter the country months later.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-vietnam-war-start-in-laos>When did the Vietnam War start in Laos?</h2>
<p>Aerial reconnaissance photo of North Vietnamese trucks on the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos. The so-called “Secret War in Laos” began in 1965 when the low intensity conflict was replaced by major military operations.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-north-vietnam-want-control-of-laos>Why did North Vietnam want control of Laos?</h2>
<p>Control over Laos allowed for the eventual construction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail that would serve as the main supply route (MSR) for enhanced NLF (the National Liberation Front, the Vietcong) and NVA (North Vietnamese Army) activities in the Republic of Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-cia-start-the-bombing-of-laos>When did the CIA start the bombing of Laos?</h2>
<p>The bombing campaign began in 1964 and lasted until 1973. This proxy war was unknown to many at the time. An airline secretly owned by the CIA, Air America, hugely assisted in the operation. The fate of the CIA proxy war in Laos became inextricably linked to the war in Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-get-involved-in-laos>How did the US get involved in Laos?</h2>
<p>The Geneva Accords blocked any direct involvement, but in support of U.S. policy, military and economic aid was sent to Laos followed in 1957 by CIA involvement in secret missions. When the Communist insurgency resumed in northern Laos in 1959, the CIA’s Air America and Special Forces teams helped FAR with supply, logistics and training.</p>
