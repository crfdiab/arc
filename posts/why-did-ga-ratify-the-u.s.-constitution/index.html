<h2 id=why-did-ga-ratify-the-us-constitution>Why did GA ratify the U.S. Constitution?</h2>
<p>Georgians had several reasons to support the ratification of a new constitution. Georgia’s lawmakers and farmers hoped that a stronger central government would assist the state in its negotiations with the Creek Nation, which claimed large portions of Georgia as part of its land.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-georgia-ratify-the-articles-of-confederation>When did Georgia ratify the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>January 2, 1788<br>
Delaware: December 7, 1787. Pennsylvania: December 12, 1787. New Jersey: December 18, 1787. Georgia: January 2, 1788.</p>
<h2 id=which-did-georgia-support-for-the-us-constitution>Which did Georgia support for the U.S. Constitution?</h2>
<p>Georgia support for the U.S. Constitution took place to create strong central government. While they also supported to replace the Articles of Confederation altogether.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-it-take-so-long-to-ratify-the-articles-of-confederation>Why did it take so long to ratify the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>The Articles of Confederation took four years to be ratified, it took so long because there were several land claims between Virginia and Maryland. During this period of struggle, despite the lack of ratification of all States, Congress took the Articles as a de facto government.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-the-us-constitution-and-the-georgia-constitution>What is the difference between the U.S. Constitution and the Georgia Constitution?</h2>
<p>The Georgia Constitution, like the US Constitution makes mention of the three branches of government—legislative, executive, and judicial. Overall, the Georgia state constitution is more detailed and lengthier than the federal Constitution. It has been revised many more times to meet current issues of the period.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-georgia-want-to-ratify-the-constitution>Why did Georgia want to ratify the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Since Georgia was the youngest state, it needed help and a strong government to help protect it from Indian threats and to acquire lands from the Indians. After all this happened, there was a ‘special’ convention which was called to consider ratification of the U.S. constitution.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-georgia-the-youngest-state-to-ratify-the-constitution>Why was Georgia the youngest state to ratify the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Since Georgia was the youngest state, it needed help and a strong government to help protect it from Indian threats and to acquire lands from the Indians. After all this happened, there was a ‘special’ convention which was called to consider ratification of the U.S. constitution. By January 4, 1788.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-fourth-state-to-ratify-the-constitution>Which is the fourth state to ratify the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Georgia was the fourth state to do so. Georgia’s ratification message was short and to the point.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-included-in-the-georgia-state-constitution>What was included in the Georgia State Constitution?</h2>
<p>As in other seceded states, this convention was charged with framing a state constitution that would be acceptable to the federal government. The document had to include a repeal of the Ordinance of Secession, the abolition of slavery, and a repudiation of the war debt.</p>
