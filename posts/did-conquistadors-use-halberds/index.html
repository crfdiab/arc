<h2 id=did-conquistadors-use-halberds>Did conquistadors use halberds?</h2>
<p>Conquistador infantry also made use of spears and halberds. Combining an axe blade with a stabbing tip, the halberd was a versatile weapon. Measuring at least six feet in length, it could be used effectively in both defensive and offensive situations.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-spanish-helmets-called>What were the Spanish helmets called?</h2>
<p>morion<br>
A morion (Spanish: morrión) is a type of open helmet originally from the Kingdom of Castile (Spain), used from the beginning 16th to early 17th centuries, usually having a flat brim and a crest from front to back.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-spanish-have-better-weapons-than-the-aztecs>Did the Spanish have better weapons than the Aztecs?</h2>
<p>There were many different reasons why the Spanish were able to take over the Aztec Empire. Different wepons were used through the battle to help Cortes overrule the aztecs. First, their weapons and armor were better than the Aztecs’. The Spanish had metal armor and shields.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-wear-in-spain-to-look-like-a-local>What to wear in Spain to look like a local?</h2>
<p>If you want to look like a local, focus on what the locals wear in the places you’ll be visiting. Dressing like a local in Spain can be… challenging. On the surface, Spanish style doesn’t seem that different from the rest of Europe, or even from the States. Jeans, sneakers, high waisted pants, and well matched basics are everywhere.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-shorts-do-guys-wear-in-spain>What kind of shorts do guys wear in Spain?</h2>
<p>Lots of guys wear espadrilles with no socks and their pants rolled up. And if you really need to wear shorts, remember that Spanish guys either wear their shorts long and tight or really, really short. It’s weird, but true. The good news for ladies, is that it’s almost comically easy to blend in with Spanish styles.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-some-of-the-famous-spanish-explorers>Who are some of the famous Spanish explorers?</h2>
<p>Hernán Cortés. Hernán Cortés, marqués del Valle de Oaxaca, was a Spanish conquistador who overthrew the Aztec empire and won Mexico for the crown of Spain. Francisco Vázquez de Coronado. The expedition team of Francisco Vázquez de Coronado discovered the Grand Canyon and many other famous landmarks.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-pack-for-a-trip-to-spain>What should I pack for a trip to Spain?</h2>
<p>Try to pack at least one nice button up shirt, and a pair of pants that you’d actually wear to work. I have some great travel pants from Bluffworks and Western Rise, but they don’t look like travel pants.</p>
