<h2 id=what-country-has-a-higher-birth-rate-than-death-rate>What country has a higher birth rate than death rate?</h2>
<p>In the United States, birth rates are higher than death rates at present, partly due to the relatively young age structure of the U.S. population. Immigrants, who are younger on average than the U.S.-born population, play a significant role in keeping the United States younger than most other developed countries.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-the-highest-birth-rate-per-1000-people>Which country has the highest birth rate per 1000 people?</h2>

<p>Based on UNICEF health records and self-reported household surveys, we list some of the countries with the highest rates of contraceptive use among sexually active women (both married and unmarried) in the world today. Most of these countries are to be found in the developing world.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-some-countries-have-a-low-birth-rate>Why do some countries have a low birth rate?</h2>
<p>Low birth rates are attributed to the high costs of raising a child, people choosing to further their careers over starting a family, and older average ages for first-time mothers. On the other end, some countries face overpopulation and the problems associated with it, such as overcrowding and poverty.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-costa-rica-have-a-high-birth-rate>Why does Costa Rica have a high birth rate?</h2>
<p>Due in part to the nation’s effective health care system, its citizens enjoy a high life expectancy, with many residents living past the age of 100. Prevention is a key component in Costa Rica’s efforts to maintain a healthy population.</p>
