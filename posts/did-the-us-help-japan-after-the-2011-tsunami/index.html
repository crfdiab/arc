<h2 id=how-tall-was-the-japanese-tsunami>How tall was the Japanese tsunami?</h2>
<p>The March 11, 2011, earthquake generated a tsunami with a maximum wave height of almost 40 meters (130 feet) in the Iwate Prefecture. Researchers also determined that a 2,000-kilometer (1,242-mile) stretch of Japan’s Pacific coast was impacted by the tsunami.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-2011-japan-tsunami>What caused the 2011 Japan tsunami?</h2>
<p>On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced the strongest earthquake in its recorded history. The earthquake struck below the North Pacific Ocean, 130 kilometers (81 miles) east of Sendai, the largest city in the Tohoku region, a northern part of the island of Honshu. The Tohoku earthquake caused a tsunami.</p>

<p>approximately six minutes<br>
The 9.1-magnitude (Mw) undersea megathrust earthquake occurred on 11 March 2011 at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) in the north-western Pacific Ocean at a relatively shallow depth of 32 km (20 mi), with its epicenter approximately 72 km (45 mi) east of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku, Japan, lasting approximately six minutes.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-japan-earthquake-and-tsunami>Who was involved in the Japan earthquake and tsunami?</h2>
<p>Several countries, including Australia, China, India, New Zealand, South Korea, and the United States, sent search-and-rescue teams, and dozens of other countries and major international relief organizations such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent pledged financial and material support to Japan.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-help-japan-after-the-earthquake>How can we help Japan after the earthquake?</h2>
<p>Even if you’re thousands of miles away, there are ways that you can offer support to the earthquake and tsunami relief effort in Japan. Here are a few of them: Red Cross: The Japanese Red Cross has already deployed 11 disaster-response teams, but you can support the organization by donating money.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jacl-do-after-the-japan-earthquake>What did JACL do after the Japan earthquake?</h2>
<p>JACL and Direct Relief leveraged the generous attention received after the earthquake and tsunami by passing funding and resources on to small, grass-roots Japanese groups. Organizations supported, such as AAR Japan, responded immediately after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-aid-come-from-after-the-japan-earthquake>Where did the aid come from after the Japan earthquake?</h2>
