<p>How do sea and wind affect the climate of the Caribbean islands? When the winds blow onshore, they moderate the land temperature. As the breeze blows over the Caribbean Sea, it takes on the cooler temperature of the water. facing away from the wind-rainfall may be only 30 inches a year.</p>

<h2 id=volcanoes-which-caribbean-island-has-the-longest-river>Volcanoes. Which Caribbean island has the longest river?</h2>
<p>Cuba<br>
The longest river on a Caribbean Island is in Cuba, where the Cauto flows for 230 mi (370 km) from its source in the Sierra Maestra.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-main-crops-of-the-caribbean-islands>What are the three main crops of the Caribbean islands?</h2>
<p>crops in the Caribbean mainly comprise on sugar cane, bananas, coffee, tobacco, root crops (cassava, sweet potato and yams), some citrus fruits and cacao (Figure 3). Other commercial crops grown in the region include vegetables and fruits ( Figure 3).</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-islands-of-the-caribbean-formed>How are the islands of the Caribbean formed?</h2>
<p>There was also volcanic activity from the collision that helped form the islands. Material pushed up through the ocean by volcanic, seismic and tectonic activity created the basic Caribbean islands. Over time, material built up so that it broke through the surface of the ocean to make the current physical islands.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-landforms-are-found-in-the-caribbean>What kind of landforms are found in the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>RAINFORESTS: Rainforests are found across the Caribbean, with those on Dominica and Jamaica, the most prominent. Most islands have several ( small) waterfalls, normally located in the higher elevations. CORAL REEFS: The Caribbean is home to about 9% of the world’s coral reefs, covering about 52,000 sq km ( 20,000 sq miles ).</p>
<h2 id=are-there-volcanoes-on-most-of-the-caribbean-islands>Are there volcanoes on most of the Caribbean islands?</h2>
<p>VOLCANOES: Most of the Caribbean is volcanic in origin, and many of the smaller (as well as larger) islands have a central volcanic peak or a mountainous interior.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-bodies-of-water-in-the-caribbean>What are the major bodies of water in the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>BODIES OF WATER: The major bodies of water in the Caribbean include the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and to a smaller extent, the Gulf of Mexico. The Caribbean Sea itself is one of the largest salt water seas on the planet with an area of about 2,754,000 sq km (1,063,000 sq. miles).</p>
