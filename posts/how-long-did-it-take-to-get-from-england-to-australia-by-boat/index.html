<p>Expect Europe to Australia by sea to take at least 32-40 days and cost at least £4,000+ one-way by freighter including cabin & meals, much more if you use a cruise.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-to-get-from-england-to-australia-in-the-1850s>How long did it take to get from England to Australia in the 1850s?</h2>
<p>Prior to the 1850s it was common for sailing ships to stop en route but, by the early 1850s, most ships made the trip without stopping. The voyage became faster, with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the increasing speed of ocean-going steamships, but still took six or seven weeks to reach Australia.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-shipping-routes-of-the-18th-century-mapped>How are shipping routes of the 18th century mapped?</h2>
<p>18th Century British shipping routes visualised using modern mapping technologies. Illustration: James Cheshire, Spatial Analysis CLICK FOR FULL SIZE IMAGE Last month we looked at an example of an old mapping style being applied to modern data. This time it’s the other way round.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-ships-do-in-the-18th-century>What did ships do in the 18th century?</h2>
<p>There were two types of ships, the overseas vessel and the smaller “coasting” vessel. Overseas vessels transported cargo and passengers to destinations like America, Nova Scotia, and China. Coastal vessels transported goods and people along the coasts, such as the American east coast. They were not meant for crossing the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-fastest-sailing-route-around-the-world>Which is the fastest sailing route around the world?</h2>
<p>The clipper route fell into commercial disuse with the introduction of steam ships, and the opening of the Suez and Panama Canals. However, it remains the fastest sailing route around the world, and as such has been the route for several prominent yacht races, such as the Around Alone and Vendée Globe.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-ships-and-boats-go-after-1840>Where did ships and boats go after 1840?</h2>
<p>This overview looks at ships and boats built after 1840. Principally drawing on archaeological, technological and historical sources, it describes vessels used on English inland and coastal waters and in the open sea. The evidence of wrecks and abandoned vessels is drawn on, as well as extant vessels. Also included is the early</p>
