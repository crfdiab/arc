<h2 id=what-kind-of-metal-mines-are-the-largest-in-az>What kind of metal mines are the largest in AZ?</h2>
<p>The Morenci mine, owned jointly by Freeport-McMoran and Sumitomo, is the largest copper producer in the state, and regularly contributes about half of Arizona’s copper production.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-of-the-worlds-copper-comes-from-arizona>How much of the worlds copper comes from Arizona?</h2>

<h2 id=is-there-silver-in-arizona>Is there silver in Arizona?</h2>
<p>Silver mining in Arizona was a powerful stimulus for exploration and prospecting in early Arizona. Cumulative silver production through 1981 totaled 490 million troy ounces (15 million kg). However, only about 10% of Arizona’s silver production came from silver mining.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-silver-in-arizona-1>Is there Silver in Arizona?</h2>
<h2 id=why-is-there-so-much-copper-in-arizona>Why is there so much copper in Arizona?</h2>
<p>Copper mines became more abundant in Arizona during the 20th century due to several factors, including the ability to exploit low-grade ore deposits (averaging less than one percent of copper) by the use of large-scale operations such as open-pit mining and the flotation process wherein copper minerals are separated …</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-metals-are-found-in-arizona>What kind of metals are found in Arizona?</h2>

<h2 id=how-many-copper-mines-are-there-in-arizona>How many copper mines are there in Arizona?</h2>
<p>Arizona has nine active copper mines, which together account for 68% of the country’s copper output. Anything with an on/off switch uses copper.

<h2 id=what-are-the-precious-metals-in-the-commodity-market>What are the precious metals in the commodity market?</h2>
<p>The precious metals with active commodities markets include gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. The remaining PGMs – rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, and iridium – have much smaller markets compared to the main four. Why Is Gold Traded? Gold is the main precious metal utilized by speculators as a trading vehicle.</p>
