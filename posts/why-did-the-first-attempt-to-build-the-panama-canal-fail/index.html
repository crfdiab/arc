<h2 id=why-did-the-first-attempt-to-build-the-panama-canal-fail>Why did the first attempt to build the Panama Canal fail?</h2>
<p>However, after $287 million in expenditures and more than 20,000 deaths, the French attempt failed. The debacle was blamed on poor administration and corruption, but the main causes more likely were yellow fever and malaria. Count Ferdinand de Lesseps (1805-1894).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-us-succeed-in-building-the-panama-canal>Why did the US succeed in building the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>The canal was a geopolitical strategy to make the United States the most powerful nation on earth. Americans knew they needed this to move ships from east to west quickly. If they did that, they would control power because they would control the oceans.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-french-died-building-the-panama-canal>How many French died building the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>The French had tried — and failed — to build a canal in the 1880s, finally giving in after years of fighting a recalcitrant landscape, ferocious disease, the deaths of some 20,000 workers and spiralling costs.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-build-the-panama-canal>Who was the first person to build the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>By the late nineteenth century, technological advances and commercial pressure allowed construction to begin in earnest. Noted canal engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps led an initial attempt by France to build a sea-level canal.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-easier-to-build-panama-canal-or-suez-canal>Which is easier to build Panama Canal or Suez Canal?</h2>
<p>DeLesseps, who had been successful in building the Suez canal against all odds, assured everyone that building a canal in Panama would be easier to make than the Suez Canal. However, after $287 million in expenditures and more than 20,000 deaths, the French attempt failed.</p>

<p>However, after $287 million in expenditures and more than 20,000 deaths, the French attempt failed. The debacle was blamed on poor administration and corruption, but the main causes more likely were yellow fever and malaria. Count Ferdinand de Lesseps (1805-1894). The Daily Graphic, February 26, 1880.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-died-during-the-construction-of-the-panama-canal>How many people died during the construction of the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>Although there is no way of knowing the exact number of workers who died during construction, it is estimated from 6,000 up to 12,000 dead, many of them from cholera and malaria. Until the opening of the Panama Canal, the railroad transported the increased freight volume per unit length of any railroad in the world.</p>
