<h2 id=how-is-silk-quality-measured>How is silk quality measured?</h2>
<p>The important silk quality measure is the weight, which we refer to as the momme count. The momme count is found by weighing a piece of fabric (always 100 feet long by 45 inches wide) in pounds. Manito silk is 22 momme count which means that 100 yards of our silk weighs 22 pounds.</p>

<table><tr><th>unit of weight of silk (6)</th></tr><tr><td>Unit of weight of gemstones (5)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARAT</td></tr><tr><td>Units of weight of 1000 grams (5)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILOS</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-are-fabrics-measured>How are fabrics measured?</h2>
<p>Fabrics come in various widths, so a yard of the fabric refers to the length of material only. The material is unrolled from the bolt, and you should measure 36 inches or 3 feet. That’s precisely how much a yard of fabric is.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-silk-known-as>What is silk known as?</h2>
<p>Silk is known as the Queen of all textile fibres because of its sheen and luster. It is one of the most beautiful and precious fibres given to us by nature and has been very much overshadowed over the past few decades by the other natural fibres and more particularly by synthetics.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-captain-hooks-sidekick>Who is Captain Hook’s sidekick?</h2>
<p>Smee<br>
Smee (voiced by Ed Gilbert in an Irish accent) is Captain Hook’s right-hand man. His weapon is named Johnny Corkscrew.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-deputy-head-of-a-monastery-called>What is the deputy head of a monastery called?</h2>
<table><tr><th>deputy head of a monastery (5)</th></tr><tr><td>Office of the head of a monastery (6)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ABBACY</td></tr><tr><td>Pertaining to the head of a monastery (8)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ABBATIAL</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-much-fabric-is-a-meter>How much fabric is a meter?</h2>
<p>1 meter = 1.0936133 yards.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-word-silk-come-from-in-english>Where does the word silk come from in English?</h2>
<p>The word silk comes from Old English: sioloc, from Ancient Greek: σηρικός, romanized: sērikós, “silken”, ultimately from an Asian source — compare Mandarin sī “silk”, Manchurian sirghe, Mongolian sirkek.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-make-silk>Who was the first person to make silk?</h2>
<p>Silk was made by Yuri Vishnevsky, with music and sound crafted by Mat Jarvis. Art shared with Silk is licensed under Creative Commons. If you enjoyed Silk, please let me know! Press Space to start anew. Press Z to undo. Try different colors and symmetries. Sally forth, you weaver of wonder, sower of silken waves.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-cocoons-are-used-to-make-silk>What kind of cocoons are used to make silk?</h2>
<p>In commercial use, silk is almost entirely limited to filaments from the cocoons of domesticated silkworms (caterpillars of several moth species belonging to the genus Bombyx ). See also sericulture. Commercial silk is made from the fibrous cocoons of silkworm caterpillars ( Bombyx species).</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-make-a-kilogram-of-silk>How long does it take to make a kilogram of silk?</h2>
<p>The process takes around 40 hours to produce a half kilogram of silk. Many local operations use a reeling machine for this task, but some silk threads are still hand-reeled. The difference is that hand-reeled threads produce three grades of silk: two fine grades that are ideal for lightweight fabrics, and a thick grade for heavier material.</p>
