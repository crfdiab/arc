<h2 id=what-three-things-did-jane-addams-do>What three things did Jane Addams do?</h2>
<p>Jane Addams cofounded and led Hull House, one of the first settlement houses in North America. Hull House provided child care, practical and cultural training and education, and other services to the largely immigrant population of its Chicago neighbourhood. Addams also successfully advocated for social reform.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-some-of-jane-addams-accomplishments>What were some of Jane Addams accomplishments?</h2>
<p>Jane Addams was the second woman to receive the Peace Prize. She founded the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom in 1919, and worked for many years to get the great powers to disarm and conclude peace agreements.</p>
<h2 id=which-sociologist-won-the-nobel-peace-prize>Which sociologist won the Nobel Peace Prize?</h2>
<p>Durkheim is commonly cited as the father of sociology. He was concerned with how societies could maintain their solidarity. Addams was the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-jane-addams-do-most-of-her-work>Where did Jane Addams do most of her work?</h2>
<p>While she was in London, she visited a settlement house called Toynbee Hall. Settlement houses were created to provide community services to ease urban problems such as poverty. Inspired by Toynbee Hall, Addams and her friend, Ellen Gates Starr, opened Hull House in a neighborhood of slums in Chicago in 1889.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-jane-addams-called-the-beloved-lady>Why was Jane Addams called the beloved lady?</h2>
<p>Jane Addams was called the “beloved lady” of American reform. She was a social worker, reformer, and pacifist. One of her most important accomplishments was to create a settlement house, a center that provides services to members of a poor community.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-jane-addams-and-ellen-starr-live>Where did Jane Addams and Ellen Starr Live?</h2>
<p>Inspired in part by the Toynbee Hall settlement house in London’s East End, where university graduates lived in community with working class and poor people, Jane Addams and Ellen Starr founded their own settlement house on Chicago’s West Side in 1889.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-jane-addams-write-20-years-at-hull-house>Why did Jane Addams write 20 years at Hull House?</h2>
<p>In her autobiography, 20 Years at Hull-House (1910), she argued that society should both respect the values and traditions of immigrants and help the newcomers adjust to American institutions. A new social ethic was needed, she said, to stem social conflict and address the problems of urban life and industrial capitalism.</p>
