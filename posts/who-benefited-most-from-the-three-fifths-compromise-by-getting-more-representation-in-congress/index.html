<h2 id=who-benefited-most-from-the-three-fifths-compromise-by-getting-more-representation-in-congress>Who benefited most from the Three-Fifths Compromise by getting more representation in Congress?</h2>
<p>Origins of the Three-Fifths Compromise It benefitted Southern states to include enslaved people in their population counts, as that calculation would give them more seats in the House of Representatives and thus more political power.</p>
<h2 id=which-state-has-the-most-representatives-based-on-the-population-for-representation-35-compromise>Which state has the most representatives based on the population for representation 3/5 compromise?</h2>
<p>Northern states disagreed. The delegates compromised. To figure out the number of representatives each had they would count the free population and add 3/5 of the number of slaves held in that state….</p>
<table><tr><th>State Name</th><td>Pennsylvania</td></tr><tr><th>Total Population</th><td>433,611</td></tr><tr><th>Free Population</th><td>429,904</td></tr><tr><th>Slave Population</th><td>3,707</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=did-the-35-compromise-help-the-northern-or-southern-states>Did the 3/5 compromise help the northern or Southern states?</h2>
<p>The Three-Fifths compromise gave southern states disproportionate representation in the House of Representatives relative to free states, thereby helping the southern states to preserve slavery.</p>
<h2 id=why-would-southern-states-be-happy-with-the-35ths-compromise>Why would Southern states be happy with the 3/5ths compromise?</h2>
<p>Southern states had wanted representation apportioned by population; after the Virginia Plan was rejected, the Three-Fifths Compromise seemed to guarantee that the South would be strongly represented in the House of Representatives and would have disproportionate power in electing Presidents.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-three-fifths-compromise-at-the-constitutional-convention>What was the Three Fifths Compromise at the Constitutional Convention?</h2>
<p>The three-fifths compromise was an agreement, made at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, that allowed Southern states to count a portion of its enslaved population for purposes of taxation and representation. The compromise gave the South more power than it would have had if enslaved people had not been counted.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-great-compromise>What was the result of the Great Compromise?</h2>
<p>Neither the large nor the small states would yield, but the deadlock was resolved by the Connecticut, or Great, Compromise, which resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature with proportional representation in the lower house and equal representation of the states in the upper house.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-compromise-create-a-bicameral-legislature>How did the Great Compromise create a bicameral legislature?</h2>
<p>The “good joint” that emerged from weeks of stalemate was called the “Great Compromise” and created a bicameral legislature with a House, where membership was determined by state population, and a Senate, where each state had two seats regardless of population.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-compromise-of-the-virginia-plan>What was the Compromise of the Virginia Plan?</h2>
<p>On July 16th the delegates adopted, by a narrow margin, the “Connecticut Compromise” which retained the bicameral legislature of the Virginia Plan but gave equal representation to the people in the House and equal representation to each State in the Senate.</p>
