<p>What Was the Largest Hurricane to Hit the United States? Damage from the Great Galveston Hurricane. Damage from the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 was caused by the hurricane itself and its resulting storm surge. This was the greatest natural disaster, in terms of loss of life, in U.S. history.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-highest-wind-speed-ever-recorded-in-a-hurricane>What was the highest wind speed ever recorded in a hurricane?</h2>
<p>Hurricane Camille of 1969 had the highest wind speed at landfall, at an estimated 190 miles per hour when it struck the Mississippi coast. This wind speed at landfall is the highest ever recorded worldwide. Actual maximum sustained winds will never be known because the hurricane destroyed every wind-recording instrument in the landfall area.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-deadliest-hurricane-in-the-world>What was the most deadliest hurricane in the world?</h2>
<p>The Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900 was the deadliest hurricane to ever hit the United States and caused between 8000 and 12000 deaths. The storm reached the Texas coast south of Galveston on September 8 as a Category 4 hurricane with a storm surge of 8 to 15 feet.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-largest-hurricane-to-hit-puerto-rico>What was the largest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>The Okeechobee Hurricane, also known as the San Felipe Segundo Hurricane, had the highest wind speed at landfall of any hurricane to impact an inhabited U.S. territory. It had wind speeds of 160 miles per hour when it made landfall in Puerto Rico in 1928. The Okeechobee Hurricane is the only hurricane to strike Puerto Rico as a Category 5 storm.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-costliest-hurricane-in-us-history>What was the costliest hurricane in US history?</h2>
<p>When the hurricane hit Miami, Florida, in 2005, it was labeled as a Category 5, but later turned into a Category 3 when reaching Louisiana. An estimated 1,200 lives were lost during this storm and the total cost in damages is approximately $108 billion. For this reason, Hurricane Katrina is also the costliest hurricane in U.S. history.</p>
