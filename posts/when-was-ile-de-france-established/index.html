<h2 id=when-was-ile-de-france-established>When was Ile de France established?</h2>
<p>It was created as the “District of the Paris Region” in 1961. In 1976, its status was aligned with the French administrative regions that were created in 1972, it was renamed after the historic province of Île-de-France. Residents are sometimes referred to as Franciliens, an administrative word created in the 1980s.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-ile-de-france-important>Why is Ile de France Important?</h2>
<p>Europe’s leading economic area. With 12 million inhabitants, 944,000 businesses and 646,000 students, Ile de France accounts for 4.6% of EU GDP, making it Europe’s leading economic area. The €640 billion of GDP it generates is as much as the Netherlands, and more than Switzerland (Paris Region Key Figures).</p>

Abandoned by the Dutch, the island became a French colony when, in September 1715, Guillaume Dufresne D’Arsel landed and took possession of this precious port of call on the route to India. He named the island “Isle de France”, but it was only in 1721 that the French started their occupation.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-decide-to-conquer-ile-de-france>Why did the British decide to conquer Ile de France?</h2>
<p>The Battle of Grand Port was a naval battle between squadrons of frigates from the French Navy and the British Royal Navy.

<h2 id=are-mauritians-white>Are Mauritians white?</h2>
<p>Nowadays, a significant proportion of them are predominantly black with varying amounts of French and Indian ancestry. Rodriguais and Chagossians are usually incorporated within the Creole ethnic group. Franco-Mauritians (Mauritians of French ancestry) form around two percent of the population.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-mauritius-once-called>What was Mauritius once called?</h2>
<p>It was originally known as Bourg Mahé. From that year until 1810, the island was in charge of officials appointed by the French Government, except for a brief period during the French Revolution, when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France.</p>
<h2 id=is-mauritius-owned-by-france>Is Mauritius owned by France?</h2>
<p>France took control in 1715, renaming it Isle de France. In 1810, the island was seized by Great Britain, and four years later France ceded Mauritius and its dependencies to Britain. Mauritius remained a primarily plantation-based colony of the United Kingdom until independence in 1968.</p>
<h2 id=what-name-did-the-british-gave-to-mauritius>What name did the British gave to Mauritius?</h2>

<p>The first direct election of the regional council by the inhabitants of Île-de-France was held on 16 March 1986. The powers and visibility of the region were henceforth greatly increased as the process of devolution and regionalisation increased. The Île-de-Province was divided into several sub-provinces (French: pays ).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-ile-de-france-important-to-france>Why is the Ile de France important to France?</h2>
<p>Île-de-France is the most densely populated région in France. In the century between 1850 and 1950, when most areas of France were losing population, Paris attracted migrants from all over the country, as well as a large number of immigrants. Île-de-France had a fourfold growth in population between 1850 and 1968.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-departments-does-the-ile-de-france-have>How many departments does the Ile de France have?</h2>
<p>It is composed of eight departments centred on its innermost department and capital, Paris. Around the departmental of Paris, urbanisation fills a first concentric ring of three departments commonly known as the petite couronne (“small ring”); it extends into a second outer ring of four departments known as the grande couronne (“large ring”).</p>
