<h2 id=who-are-the-2-most-famous-footballers-from-argentina>Who are the 2 most famous footballers from Argentina?</h2>
<p>Argentina is one of the most popular football teams in the world. They’ve won two World Cups and a number of Copa America titles. We’ve seen many world-famous footballers represent this country. Football legend Diego Maradona and current sensation Lionel Messi are the two most well-known names in Argentine football.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-argentinas-best-player>Who is Argentina’s best player?</h2>
<p>1. Lionel Messi. There should not be too much discussion over who leads this list of Argentina’s best. Lionel Messi may not be the towering force he was two years ago, but the little Barcelona genius remains the best player in the world and an inspiration for any team blessed with his presence.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-greatest-argentine-football-player-of-all-time>Who is the greatest Argentine football player of all time?</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that Diego Maradona is the greatest footballer ever to grace the game. That means that he is surely the greatest to play for Argentina. Having single-handedly won his country the 1986 world cup, Maradona would become known as one of the greatest naturally talented players to step onto the pitch.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-players-are-in-a-football-team-in-argentina>How many players are in a football team in Argentina?</h2>
<p>The teams consisted of eight players each as the organisers were unable to find more players for the match.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-argentine-soccer-player-that-died>Who was the Argentine soccer player that died?</h2>
<p>Emiliano Sala was an Argentine football player who played for prominent French clubs like Bordeaux and Nantes. He was renowned for his powerful strike and eye for goal. In 2019, he was included in the Nantes Team of the Decade. Emiliano Sala died in a plane crash on 21 January 2019. His body was recovered four days after the crash.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-youngest-soccer-player-in-argentina>Who is the youngest soccer player in Argentina?</h2>
<p>Argentine footballer and Manchester City striker Sergio Agüero was the youngest footballer of the Argentine Primera División, at 15. From scoring two goals in the semi-final to help Argentina win the 2008 Olympic gold medal, to being the fourth-highest goal-scorer of Premier League, he has many feats to his credit.</p>
