<h2 id=where-is-the-hang-river>Where is the Hang river?</h2>
<p>Northern China<br>
The Huang He River, also known as the Yellow River, is a prevalent body of water located in Northern China. It is the country’s second largest river and the sixth longest river in the world, expanding 5474 km.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-yellow-river-the-yangtze-river>Is the Yellow river the Yangtze River?</h2>
<p>Two great rivers run through China Proper: the Yellow River in the north, and the Yangtze (or Yangzi ) River to the south. In fact, most of China Proper belongs to the drainage-basins of these two rivers. Both originate to the far west in the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-a-river-begin-on-its-journey>Where does a river begin on its journey?</h2>
<p>Every river has a ‘ source ‘, a place where the river begins its journey. Where is the source of a river? The source of a river is usually found in high places such as hills or mountains. A river can have more than one source. Some rivers begin where a natural spring releases water from underground.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-snake-river-begin-and-end>Where does the Snake River begin and end?</h2>
<p>The two major catastrophic flooding events which are believed to have significantly affected the river and its surrounding area are the Bonneville floods and the Missoula floods. The Snake River begins its journey from the western side of the state of Wyoming and flows across the Snake River Plain in the southern part of Idaho.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-brazos-river-begin-and-end>Where does the Brazos River begin and end?</h2>
<p>The Brazos flows east across Dallas before turning south and flowing through Baylor University. It runs further south towards Calvert and Brayan and into Richmond. It drains into the Mexican Gulf, a few miles from Freeport. The river is dammed thrice to form Lake Granbury, Lake Whitney, and Possum Kingdom Lake.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-channels-in-a-river-formed>How are the channels in a river formed?</h2>
<p>At first, the channels are small and are called rills. As more water enters the channels they grow forming gullies (larger channels). The streams in the gullies eventually become big enough to form a river. The source of some rivers is a lake.</p>
