<p>Hollande was inaugurated on 15 May 2012, and shortly afterwards appointed Jean-Marc Ayrault to be his Prime Minister. He was the first Socialist Party president since François Mitterrand left office in 1995. The President of the French Republic is one of the two joint heads of state of the Principality of Andorra.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-president-of-france-from-2007-to-2012>Who was the president of France from 2007 to 2012?</h2>

<h2 id=why-is-nicolas-sarkozy-famous>Why is Nicolas Sarkozy famous?</h2>
<p>Nicolas Sarkozy, born on 28 January 1955 in Paris, France, is a French politician. He was the 23rd President of France and, because of that position, ex officio Co-Prince of Andorra from 16 May 2007 to 15 May 2012 succeeding Jacques Chirac.</p>
<h2 id=what-animal-is-the-symbol-of-france>What animal is the symbol of France?</h2>
<p>The Gallic Rooster. The Latin word “gallus” means both “rooster” and “inhabitant of Gaul”. Certain ancient coins bore a rooster, but the animal was not used as the emblem of the tribes of Gaul. Gradually the figure of the rooster became the most widely shared representation of the French people.</p>
