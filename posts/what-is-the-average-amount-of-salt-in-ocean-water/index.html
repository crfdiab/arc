<p>about 35 parts per thousand<br>
The average salinity is about 35 parts per thousand. Stated in another way, about 3.5 percent of the weight of seawater comes from the dissolved salts.</p>
<h2 id=what-percent-salt-is-in-the-ocean>What percent salt is in the ocean?</h2>
<p>3.5%<br>
The concentration of salt in seawater (its salinity) is about 35 parts per thousand; in other words, about 3.5% of the weight of seawater comes from the dissolved salts.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-salt-is-in-a-liter-of-ocean-water>How much salt is in a liter of ocean water?</h2>
<p>The salinity (saltiness) of the ocean is about 35 parts per thousand. This means that in every liter of water, there are 35 grams of salt, or about 3.5% of the weight of sea water comes from salts. The average ocean salinity is 35 parts per thousand but can vary from about 30 to 37 parts per thousand.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-salinity-of-the-average-ocean-water>What is the salinity of the average ocean water?</h2>
<p>This would be the salt concentration in parts-per-thousand ( ). Average ocean water has a salinity of 35g of dissolved salts. Expressed in %, it would be 96.5% pure water molecules and 3.5% of salts, dissolved gases, organic materials and undissolved particles.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-most-of-the-salt-in-the-ocean-come-from>Where does most of the salt in the ocean come from?</h2>
<p>The concentration of salt in seawater (salinity) varies with temperature, evaporation, and precipitation. Salinity is generally low at the equator and at the poles, and high at mid-latitudes. The average salinity is about 35 parts per thousand. Stated in another way, about 3.5 percent of the weight of seawater comes from the dissolved salts.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-salt-content-of-seawater-determined>How is the salt content of seawater determined?</h2>
<p>If the salt(s) concentration is more than 9 then ocean water is HYPERTONIC. 21 seawater is sometimes called “Duplase” but it is not often used. It has roughly 2/3 the salt content of regular seawater. Ocean salinity (expressed in – per mil) is approximately equal to the weight, in grams, of salts dissolved in 1000g of seawater.</p>
