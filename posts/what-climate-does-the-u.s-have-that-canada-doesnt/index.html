<p>The climates of the United States and Canada include the tundra of northern Canada and Alaska, the tropical climate of southern Florida and Hawaii, the humid type of the eastern United States, the seasonal type of the northern United States and most of Canada, and the arid climate of the Southwest and Great Plains.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-the-united-states-and-canada>What’s the difference between the United States and Canada?</h2>
<p>The United States of America and Canada are two different countries located in North America. The United States of America is commonly known as the United States, USA, US and America.

<p>If you look at the map on page 125, you will see that the United States has more climate zones than Canada. This variety, ranging from tundra to tropical, occurs because the country extends over such a large area north to south. Most of the United States is located in the mid-latitudes, where the climates are moderate.</p>

<h2 id=which-is-the-milder-climate-north-america-or-canada>Which is the milder climate North America or Canada?</h2>
<p>The milder, dry, and tropical climates of North America are found south of 40°N latitude. Much of the United States is located in these climate zones; little of Canada is.</p>
