<h2 id=what-climate-does-the-us-have-that-canada-doesnt>What climate does the U.S have that Canada doesnt?</h2>
<p>“What climate regions are found in the United States but not in Canada? Mediterranean, humid subtropical, desert, and tropical wet.</p>
<h2 id=what-types-of-climates-do-not-exist-in-the-us-and-canada>What types of climates do not exist in the U.S and Canada?</h2>
<p>Tropical climate does not exist in Canada, the two U.S states that have tropical climates are Florida and Hawaii. What are the Everglades?</p>
<h2 id=what-climate-regions-are-located-in-us-and-canada>What climate regions are located in U.S and Canada?</h2>
<p>The climates of the United States and Canada include the tundra of northern Canada and Alaska, the tropical climate of southern Florida and Hawaii, the humid type of the eastern United States, the seasonal type of the northern United States and most of Canada, and the arid climate of the Southwest and Great Plains.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-the-united-states-and-canada>What’s the difference between the United States and Canada?</h2>
<p>The United States of America and Canada are two different countries located in North America. The United States of America is commonly known as the United States, USA, US and America. USA and Canada are neighbors, as in they share a border, the world’s longest land border in fact. Canada is located in the northern part of North America.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-united-states-have-more-climate-zones-than-canada>Why does the United States have more climate zones than Canada?</h2>
<p>If you look at the map on page 125, you will see that the United States has more climate zones than Canada. This variety, ranging from tundra to tropical, occurs because the country extends over such a large area north to south. Most of the United States is located in the mid-latitudes, where the climates are moderate.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-climate-does-the-united-states-have>What kind of climate does the United States have?</h2>
<p>Much of the United States is located in these climate zones; little of Canada is. Most southern states have a humid subtropical climate. This means that summers are hot and muggy, with temperatures ranging from about 75°F to 90°F. Winters are usually mild and cool.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-milder-climate-north-america-or-canada>Which is the milder climate North America or Canada?</h2>
<p>The milder, dry, and tropical climates of North America are found south of 40°N latitude. Much of the United States is located in these climate zones; little of Canada is.</p>
