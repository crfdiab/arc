<h2 id=why-is-lesotho-surrounded-by-south-africa>Why is Lesotho surrounded by South Africa?</h2>
<p>History. The area known as Lesotho is completely surrounded by South Africa. Lesotho (then Basutoland, a British protectorate) was annexed to the Cape Colony in 1871, but became separate again (as a crown colony) in 1884. In 1986, South Africa supported the coup d’état in Lesotho which brought Justin Lekhanya to power.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-in-africa-is-surrounded-by-lesotho>What country in Africa is surrounded by Lesotho?</h2>
<p>the Republic of South Africa<br>
Lesotho is a democratic, sovereign and independent country with the unique characteristic of being totally surrounded by its neighbour, the Republic of South Africa. The country formerly known as Basutoland was renamed to the Kingdom of Lesotho upon independence from the UK in 1966.</p>

<p>South Africa’s home affairs spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa rejected the idea that Lesotho should be treated as a special case. “It is a sovereign country like South Africa. We sent envoys to our neighbours – Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Lesotho – before we enforced the passport rule.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-lesotho-get-its-foreign-exchange>How does Lesotho get its foreign exchange?</h2>
<p>Lesotho gets most of its foreign exchange through earnings from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), water exports to South Africa, and, to a decreasing extent, remittances from migrant laborers employed in South Africa. Lesotho has relatively low inflation, around 5.4% at the end of 2014. The economy is mostly export driven.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-lesotho-a-member-of-the-sacu>Is the Lesotho a member of the SACU?</h2>
<p>Lesotho is a member of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), and as such, does not pay tariffs to export goods to other SACU members (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland). With the exception of Botswana, these countries also form a common currency and exchange control area known as the Common Monetary Area (CMA).</p>
