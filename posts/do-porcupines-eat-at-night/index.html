<h2 id=where-do-porcupines-sleep>Where do porcupines sleep?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-a-porcupines-diet>What is a porcupines diet?</h2>

<h2 id=what-do-porcupines-hate>What do porcupines hate?</h2>

<h2 id=what-are-porcupines-afraid-of>What are porcupines afraid of?</h2>
<p>Predator Sprays Coyote or fox scent applied around your yard can help keep porcupines away, but it must be applied often. Some people claim that porcupines often catch on to the fact that there is no real predators around and start coming back.</p>
<h2 id=do-hedgehogs-have-poison-in-their-quills>Do hedgehogs have poison in their quills?</h2>
<p>Physical description. Hedgehogs are easily recognized by their spines, which are hollow hairs made stiff with keratin. Their spines are not poisonous or barbed and, unlike the quills of a porcupine, do not easily detach from their bodies. Spines can also shed when the animal is diseased or under extreme stress.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-does-a-porcupine-eat>What kind of food does a porcupine eat?</h2>
<p>And unlike most of what I learned at Scout camp, this bit of lore was actually based on truth. Porcupines really do frequent backwoods outhouses. Because they eat them. A porcupine finds a salty snack = urine + plywood. Photo by Education Specialist/Flickr through a Creative Commons license.</p>
<h2 id=what-foods-do-they-eat-in-the-appalachian-mountains>What foods do they eat in the Appalachian Mountains?</h2>
