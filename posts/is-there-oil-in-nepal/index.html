<h2 id=is-there-oil-in-nepal>Is there oil in Nepal?</h2>
<p>Nepal has no known major oil, gas, or coal reserves, and its position in the Himalayas makes it hard to reach remote communities. Consequently, most Nepali citizens have historically met their energy needs with biomass, human labor, imported kerosene, and/or traditional vertical axis water mills.</p>
<h2 id=does-nepal-have-earthquakes>Does Nepal have earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Loading up an earthquake Nepal is no stranger to earthquakes. The Himalaya are among the most seismically active regions in the world, the result of an ongoing collision between two continental plates: the Indian and the Eurasian.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-petrol-price-in-nepal-today>What is petrol price in Nepal today?</h2>
<p>If we look at the prices of petrol and diesel, there is a difference of Rs 25 to Rs 30 in the prices in India and Nepal. In Indian territories, the price of petrol is ₹ 97.29 paise and diesel ₹ 90.30 paise per litre, while in Nepal petrol is available for ₹78 (125 Nepali currency) and diesel ₹66 per litre.</p>

According to this treaty, the fuel should be sold at the cost price and only refinery charges should be added to it. that is the reason why petrol is cheaper in Nepal.</p>
