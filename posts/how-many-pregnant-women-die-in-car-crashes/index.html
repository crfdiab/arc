<h2 id=how-many-pregnant-women-die-in-car-crashes>How many pregnant women die in car crashes?</h2>
<p>It is actually hard to tell exactly how many pregnancies are lost due to motor vehicle crashes. Different studies on driving and pregnancy estimate different numbers, anywhere from 300-5,000 fetal deaths from car crashes.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-unborn-babies-die-in-accidents>How many unborn babies die in accidents?</h2>
<p>Car accidents are a serious risk factor for an unborn baby and mother. The New York Times reports that anywhere from 300 to 1,000 unborn children die as a result of car accidents every year.</p>
<h2 id=do-pregnant-women-get-in-more-car-accidents>Do pregnant women get in more car accidents?</h2>
<p>Pregnant women may be at a much higher risk of car crashes than others, especially during the second trimester, a new study finds. In the three years before they were pregnant, the women were involved in 177 car crashes a month. During pregnancy, the number jumped to 252 per month — a significant increase.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-deaths-occur-each-year-from-car-accidents>How many deaths occur each year from car accidents?</h2>
<p>Each year, 1.35 million people are killed on roadways around the world. Every day, almost 3,700 people are killed globally in crashes involving cars, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, trucks, or pedestrians. More than half of those killed are pedestrians, motorcyclists, or cyclists.</p>
<h2 id=can-slamming-on-brakes-hurt-the-baby>Can slamming on brakes hurt the baby?</h2>
<p>A woman’s womb does offer a significant level of protection for the baby inside, but any type of sudden impact or extreme force—whether that be from contact with another vehicle or just from slamming on the brakes—can cause the placenta to separate from the uterus.</p>
<h2 id=can-an-airbag-kill-a-fetus>Can an airbag kill a fetus?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, it is true that in an accident, a seat belt or airbag has the potential to cause the placenta to separate from the uterus. This is something that could not only be fatal for the fetus, but for the mother as well. And, although an air bag could harm the fetus, they should never be turned off.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-fetus-survive-a-car-accident>Can a fetus survive a car accident?</h2>
<p>Miscarriage The baby is very well protected in its amniotic fluid, so unless the stomach and uterus is punctured, or the woman undergoes a period of cardiac arrest, without breathing, the baby should survive. A miscarriage is rare in the case of most accidents, but you should still get checked.</p>
<h2 id=does-pregnancy-affect-your-driving>Does pregnancy affect your driving?</h2>
<p>Driving While Pregnant Is Riskier Than You Might Think : Shots – Health News Expectant mothers are more likely to get into serious car crashes, a study finds. The risk is highest in the second trimester, when accident rates are similar to those for people with sleep apnea.</p>
<h2 id=can-speed-bumps-hurt-baby>Can speed bumps hurt baby?</h2>
<p>Based on their data, the researchers found that speed bumps, if driven over quickly, can lead to minor injuries to the fetal brain, cause an abnormal fetal heart rate, abdominal pain, uterine contraction, increasing uterine activity, and other complications.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-bumpy-car-ride-hurt-baby>Can a bumpy car ride hurt baby?</h2>
<p>Although there is no evidence that taking a bumpy car ride works, rest assured that it won’t harm your baby either. Your baby is well-cushioned by your pelvis, tummy muscles and the amniotic fluid that surrounds her.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-children-are-killed-by-drunk-driving-each-year>How many children are killed by drunk driving each year?</h2>
<p>More than 230 children, aged 14 and under, were killed in drunk-driving crashes in 2018, the NHTSA reports. Drunk driving crashes cause more than 10,000 deaths every year, almost 30% of all traffic-related deaths. Drinking and driving costs more than $44 billion in deaths and damages annually. Drunk driving deaths per year</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-died-from-drunk-driving-in-2017>How many people died from drunk driving in 2017?</h2>
<p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 37,133 people died in traffic crashes in 2017 in the United States (latest figures available), including an estimated 10,874 people who were killed in drunk driving crashes involving a driver with an illegal BAC (.08 or greater).</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-leading-cause-of-death-from-drunk-driving>Who is the leading cause of death from drunk driving?</h2>
<p>In 2017, 21% of men were drunk in these crashes, compared to 14% for women. Car crashes are the leading cause of death for teens, and about a quarter of those crashes involve an underage drinking driver. In 2017, young drivers, 16 to 24 years old, made up 42% of drivers involved in fatal drunk-driving crashes.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-injured-in-drink-driving-accidents-in-the-uk>How many people are injured in drink driving accidents in the UK?</h2>
<p>An average of 3,551 people were seriously injured in drink driving related accidents in Great Britain each year. Approximately 85,000 people are convicted of drink driving related offences each and every year in England and Wales alone.</p>
