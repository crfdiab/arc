<h2 id=why-is-the-rhine-river-polluted>Why is the Rhine river polluted?</h2>
<p>In 1986, a fire broke out in a production plant storage room at the pharmaceutical company Sandoz in the Swiss city of Basel. As a result, huge amounts of pesticides were released into the Upper Rhine, killing a multitude of fish and micro-organisms. The accident turned the river into Europe’s biggest sewer.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-polluting-the-rhine-river>What is polluting the Rhine river?</h2>
<p>Among investigated rivers, the Rhine is thus among those most heavily polluted with microplastics. This is reported by researchers from the University of Basel, who evaluated, for the first time, the plastic concentration at the surface of one of the big European rivers.</p>

<p>Operation Plunder was a military operation to cross the Rhine on the night of 23 March 1945, launched by the 21st Army Group under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery….</p>

<h2 id=is-the-rhine-river-the-most-polluted-river-in-europe>Is the Rhine River the most polluted river in Europe?</h2>
<p>Many years ago, the Rhine was considered as one of the most polluted rivers in Europe. In 1986 the river was severely polluted by a chemical factory fire (Chemical spill turns Rhine Red – BBC News 1986 ).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-rhine-a-major-shipping-highway>Why is the Rhine a major shipping Highway?</h2>
<p>The river Rhine is a major shipping highway. To enable larger barges to use it and to speed up the journey time it has been strengthened, deepened and canalised. When a storm takes place the flow of water (or discharge) does not increase straight away. There is a gap, called a ‘Time Lag’ between the high rainfall and the peak discharge.</p>
