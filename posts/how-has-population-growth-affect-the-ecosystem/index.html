<h2 id=how-has-population-growth-affect-the-ecosystem>How has population growth affect the ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Population growth set to significantly affect ecosystem services. Changing land use can have a significant impact on a region’s vital ecosystem services, a recent research study has revealed. Large increases in urbanisation can lead to more concrete and asphalt reducing an area’s flood mitigation services.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-humans-affected-by-population-growth-of-other-organisms-in-an-area>How are humans affected by population growth of other organisms in an area?</h2>
<p>If no changes are made in the ways humans use resources on earth, there will continue to be a degradation of biodiversity until human lives can no longer be sustained. Humans affect biodiversity by their population numbers, use of land, and their lifestyles, causing damage to habitats for species.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-population-growth>What is the importance of population growth?</h2>
<p>Why Population is Important As human populations grow, human demands for resources like water, land, trees, and energy also grow. Unfortunately, the price of all this “growth” is paid for by other endangered plants and animals and an increasingly volatile and dangerous climate.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-impact-of-population-growth>What are the three impact of population growth?</h2>
<p>Population growth causes a disproportionate negative impact on the environment. Problems of population size and growth, resource utilization and depletion, and environmental deterioration must be considered jointly and on a global basis.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-the-population>What is the importance of the population?</h2>
<p>Why is population important ? The total number of people living in a particular area in a particular time is known as the population. The population is one of the important factors which helps to balance the environment , the population should in a balance with the means and resources .</p>
<h2 id=how-are-living-organisms-affected-by-an-ecosystem>How are living organisms affected by an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>An ecosystem can be defined as a group of living organisms and all the abiotic environmental factors that they interact within a given area. Both the abundance of populations of each organism and the nature of the environmental factors, affect the ecosystem and can cause it to change.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-biomes-are-most-affected-by-human-activity>What kind of biomes are most affected by human activity?</h2>
<p>The ecosystems and biomes that have been most significantly altered globally by human activity include marine and freshwater ecosystems, temperate broadleaf forests, temperate grasslands, Mediterranean forests, and tropical dry forests.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-community-and-an-ecosystem>What is the difference between a community and an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>A community is only the living organisms that interact within a given area. What is Ecosystem? An ecosystem can be defined as a group of living organisms and all the abiotic environmental factors that they interact within a given area.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-mountain-ecosys-tems-affected-by-human-activity>How are mountain ecosys-TEMS affected by human activity?</h2>
<p>Mountain ecosys- tems are extremely fragile as degradation of forest cover leads to severe erosion of soil and changes in river courses. Island ecosystems are easily affected by any form of human activity which can lead to the rapid extinction of sev- eral of their unique species of plants and ani- mals.</p>
