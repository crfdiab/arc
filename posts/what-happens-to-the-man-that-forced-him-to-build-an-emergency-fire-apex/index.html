<h2 id=why-does-the-mans-third-fire-go-out-in-to-build-a-fire>Why does the man’s third fire go out in to build a fire?</h2>
<p>When the time to light a third fire comes, his hands have got frosbitten to keep it burning. The man has managed to light it , but as he knows he will not be able to handle the matches to light it again, he spreads it – snuffs it – out and the fire , finally, goes out.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-mans-fire-in-to-build-a-fire>What happens to the man’s fire in to build a fire?</h2>
<p>When the man builds his fire under the tree, snow falls on it from the boughs. The man is really struggling because he does not seem to have outdoorsman skills. He stumbles his way into the limited shelter of the tree, and that is where he chooses to build his fire.</p>
<h2 id=what-mistake-does-the-man-make-in-to-build-a-fire>What mistake does the man make in To Build a Fire?</h2>

<h2 id=what-mistake-does-the-man-make-in-to-build-a-fire-1>What mistake does the man make in to build a fire?</h2>

<p>Even when nothing has gone wrong, the man needs a fire to survive. The building of a fire thus symbolizes life in the story, but also life through human knowledge, skill, and technology. And the failure of the man to build a fire is the failure of these things, as expressed in the man, and in the brutal cold of nature.</p>

<h2 id=why-did-the-man-build-the-third-fire>Why did the man build the third fire?</h2>
<p>The dog really doesn’t want to leave any of the fires but the man pushes on, after the first two, because he thinks he can beat nature at her own game. He makes the mistake with the third fire because he lacked judgment from his cold and desperation. what’s the man’s mission ?</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-boys-represent-in-to-build-a-fire>What do the boys represent in to build a fire?</h2>
<p>To Build A Fire Summary & Analysis. The boys represent civilization and protection from nature. The man is alone in nature, which is dangerous.
