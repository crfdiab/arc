<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-be-called-latino>What does it mean to be called Latino?</h2>
<p>A Latino/a or Hispanic person can be any race or color. In general, “Latino” is understood as shorthand for the Spanish word latinoamericano (or the Portuguese latino-americano) and refers to (almost) anyone born in or with ancestors from Latin America and living in the U.S., including Brazilians.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-term-latino-come-from>Where does the term Latino come from?</h2>
<p>In the English language, the term Latino is a loan word from American Spanish. (Oxford Dictionaries attributes the origin to Latin-American Spanish.) Its origin is generally given as a shortening of latinoamericano, Spanish for ‘Latin American’.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-term-is-hispanic>What kind of term is Hispanic?</h2>
<p>People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino or Spanish may be of any race.” The U.S. Department of Transportation defines Hispanic as, “persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish or Portuguese culture or origin, regardless of race.”</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-latina-and-latino>What’s the difference between Latina and Latino?</h2>
<p>LATINO/LATINA Someone who is native of, or descends from, a Latin American country. The term Latino/Latina includes people from Brazil and excludes those who were born in or descended from Spain. Thus, Hispanic refers more to language, while Latino/Latina refers more to culture.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-latino-and-a-hispanic>What’s the difference between a Latino and a Hispanic?</h2>
<p>The term Latino is one that came into popular use in the 1990s as an alternative to the term Hispanic, although the word was in existence long before. Latino is a shortened way of saying Latinoamericano meaning Latin-American.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-so-many-people-call-themselves-latino>Why do so many people call themselves Latino?</h2>
<p>You don’t hear people say ‘Hispanic music,’ they say ‘Latino music,’ ” said Joe Kutchera, author of “Latino Link: Building Brands Online with Hispanic Communities and Content.” “Latino media outlets have turned to Latino more because the term feels more inclusive, but that can always change.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-word-latino-a-masculine-or-feminine-noun>Is the word Latino a masculine or feminine noun?</h2>
<p>“Latino” is a masculine noun but is also used to describe a group of people of mixed gender. Additionally, there is growing concern that the term Latino is exclusionary of those of Afro -Latino backgrounds. For these reasons it’s no surprise, this term is also imperfect. Enter the creation of the newly popular Latinx.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-so-many-people-uncomfortable-with-the-term-latinx>Why are so many people uncomfortable with the term Latinx?</h2>
<p>Scharrón-del Río says that Latinx often “creates discomfort” because it reclaims the history of LGBTQ Latinos and Latinas who have been overlooked and neglected. Scharrón-del Río says despite the Pew data, they hope Latinx sticks around.</p>
