<h2 id=how-did-humans-migrate-from-asia-to-alaska>How did humans migrate from Asia to Alaska?</h2>
<p>For more than half a century, the prevailing story of how the first humans came to the Americas went like this: Some 13,000 years ago, small bands of Stone Age hunters walked across a land bridge between eastern Siberia and western Alaska, eventually making their way down an ice-free inland corridor into the heart of …</p>
<h2 id=how-did-humans-migrate-to-alaska>How did humans migrate to Alaska?</h2>
<p>There is plenty of evidence to suggest that humans migrated to the North American continent via Beringia, a land mass that once bridged the sea between what is now Siberia and Alaska.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-first-humans-in-alaska>Who were the first humans in Alaska?</h2>
<p>Trade with both Asia and southern tribes was active even before the advent of Europeans. Today, early Alaskans are divided into several main groups: the Southeastern Coastal Native Americans (the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian), the Athabascans, the Aleut, the two groups of Eskimos, and Inupiat and Yup’ik.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-people-migrate-from-asia-to-america>Where did people migrate from Asia to America?</h2>
<p>They conclude that the ancestors of these infants started out in East Asia about 35,000 years ago. As they traveled east, they became genetically isolated from other Asians. At some point during the last ice age they crossed a frozen land bridge from Siberia to Alaska called ” Beringia .”</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-migration-to-the-americas>When was the first migration to the Americas?</h2>
<p>The first, led by the Centre for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen and published in Science, found there was only one initial migration, no more than 23,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-americans-cross-from-asia>Where did the first Americans cross from Asia?</h2>
<p>Crossing From Asia, the First Americans Rushed Into the Unknown. One group turned and headed north, following the retreating glaciers into Canada and back to Alaska. The other branch took a remarkable journey south. The genetic data suggest that this group spread swiftly across much of North America and South America about 14,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-are-the-human-remains-found-in-alaska>How old are the human remains found in Alaska?</h2>
<p>In Alaska, scientists have uncovered something they say is remarkable: the remains of two infants dating back more than 11,000 years. Their discovery is evidence of the earliest wave of migration into the Americas.</p>
