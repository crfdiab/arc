<h2 id=is-there-any-agriculture-land-in-singapore>Is there any agriculture land in Singapore?</h2>
<p>Singapore is a small country with only around 720 square kilometres of land….Number of licensed local farms in 2019.</p>
<table><tr><th>Number of licensed local farms in 2019</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Land-based</td><td>Fish (including 1 indoor farm)</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Leafy vegetables (including 25 indoor and 2 rooftop farms</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Beansprouts</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Hen and quail eggs</td><td>5</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-much-is-agricultural-land-in-singapore>How much is agricultural land in Singapore?</h2>
<p>Agricultural land (% of land area) in Singapore was reported at 0.93089 % in 2018, according to the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources.</p>
<h2 id=how-singapore-is-farming-in-the-sky>How Singapore is farming in the sky?</h2>
<p>Now Singapore is applying the vertical model to urban agriculture — experimenting with rooftop gardens and vertical farms in order to feed its many residents. Currently only seven percent of Singapore’s food is grown locally. “But money (is) worthless without food,” according to Sky Greens Director Jack Ng.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-singaporean-farmers-were-using-indoor-farming>Why do Singaporean farmers were using indoor farming?</h2>
<p>In addition, indoor farming keeps pests out, thus eliminating the need for pesticides. It also allows us to cultivate temperate plants that otherwise would not be able to thrive in Singapore’s tropical climate. Instead of sunlight, vegetables in Farm deLight depend on the red and blue LED lights to photosynthesize.</p>
<h2 id=why-there-is-no-agriculture-in-singapore>Why there is no agriculture in Singapore?</h2>
<p>The agricultural production in Singapore is not enough to deliver to the needs of the country’s people, and as such, about 90 percent of the country’s food comes from overseas imports, making food security an important issue.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-does-not-have-agriculture>Which country does not have agriculture?</h2>
<p>According to a recent World Bank report, the countries with the smallest percentages of land used for agriculture today include Suriname, Greenland, Singapore, the Bahamas, the Seychelles, and Norway.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-become-a-farmer-in-singapore>How can I become a farmer in Singapore?</h2>
<p>You will need to apply for a farm licence when your leasehold has been successfully tendered or tenancy land has been approved for farming. As per licence application requirement, you have to be the lessee or tenant of the farmland or the premises approved for farming use. The licence fee payable is S$100 per annum.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-challenges-for-farming-in-singapore>What are the challenges for farming in Singapore?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Singapore’s food security challenge.</li>
<li>Price-sensitive Singaporeans.</li>
<li>Ill-prepared and Fragmented Industry.</li>
<li>Looking ahead.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-the-problem-with-agriculture-in-singapore>What is the problem with agriculture in Singapore?</h2>
<p>The problem faced in Singapore is that small farms were side lined due to the country’s focus on rapid industrialization. In 2014, only 1% of the land was used for agricultural purposes, a number which later shrank to 0.5%. In order to bring agriculture back to the country, the government will need to focus on land intensification.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-most-of-the-farming-take-place-in-singapore>Where does most of the farming take place in Singapore?</h2>
<p>Farming takes place mostly in the countryside region of Singapore, where the farms are located. About 113.9 hectares of land are allocated for vegetable farming as of 2014. Agriculture in the country is responsible for less than 0.5 percent of the country gross domestic product (GDP), as of 2010.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-agricultural-products-does-singapore-produce>What kind of agricultural products does Singapore produce?</h2>
