<h2 id=where-did-the-angles-come-from-before-england>Where did the Angles come from before England?</h2>
<p>he Saxons, Angles, Jutes and Frisians were tribes of Germanic people who originally came from the area of current northern Germany and Denmark. These tribes invaded Britain during the Roman occupation and again once it had ended.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-angles-come-from-denmark>Did the Angles come from Denmark?</h2>
<p>The Angles gradually migrated west from what is now Poland about the first century AD until, by the fourth century they had settled in modern central Denmark, replacing the Germanic Cimbri and Teutones who had existed there in diminished numbers since before the first century BC.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-people-of-the-angles-come-from>Where did the people of the angles come from?</h2>
<p>The Angles (Old English: Ængle, Engle; Latin: Angli; German: Angeln) were one of the main Germanic peoples who settled in Great Britain in the post-Roman period. They founded several kingdoms in Anglo-Saxon England, and their name is the root of the name England (“land of Ængle”).</p>
<h2 id=how-are-angels-related-to-the-creation-of-the-earth>How are angels related to the creation of the Earth?</h2>
<p>Angels are personal spirit beings created to worship and serve God. We don’t know when angels were created in relation to the events of Genesis 1—2, but Scripture indicates that angels were present when God created the earth ( Job 38:4–7 ). Angels are mysterious to us, and they are powerful beings, but they are created as all things are.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-bible-say-about-the-origin-of-angels>What does the Bible say about the origin of Angels?</h2>
<p>The best place to answer the question about the origin of angels is to turn to Scripture. We know from the Bible that Angels were created by God. We know from Scripture that angels haven’t always existed. They were specifically created by God before He even made the universe.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-angles-live-in-ancient-germany>Where did the angles live in ancient Germany?</h2>
<p>Angles an ancient Germanic tribe that inhabited the north-eastern coast of Germany and the central part of the Jutland peninsula at the beginning of our era. It is first mentioned in written sources by ancient Roman historians Tacitus and Ptolemy.</p>
