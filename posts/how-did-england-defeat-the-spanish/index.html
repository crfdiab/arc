<h2 id=how-did-england-defeat-the-spanish>How did England defeat the Spanish?</h2>
<p>In 1588, King Philip II of Spain sent an armada (a fleet of ships) to collect his army from the Netherlands, where they were fighting, and take them to invade England. However, an important reason why the English were able to defeat the Armada was that the wind blew the Spanish ships northwards.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-england-defeat-the-spanish-armada-sent-to-invade-them>How did England defeat the Spanish Armada sent to invade them?</h2>
<p>English ships sailed from Plymouth to attack the Armada. They were faster and more manoeuvrable than the larger Spanish galleons, enabling them to fire on the Armada without loss as the Armada sailed east off the south coast of England….Spanish Armada.</p>
<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>July–August 1588</th></tr><tr><td>Result</td><td>English victory</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-did-the-english-and-spanish-fight>Why did the English and Spanish fight?</h2>
<p>The Anglo-Spanish War broke out in 1585, following the seizure of English merchant ships in Spanish harbors. In August, England joined the Eighty Years’ War on the side of the Dutch Protestant United Provinces, which had declared their independence from Spain.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-defeat-of-the-spanish-armada-affect-england>How did the defeat of the Spanish Armada affect England?</h2>
<p>Spain, after the defeat of the Armada, remained the premier maritime power outside China. However, the defeat of the Armada did lead to long-term changes that proved to be very important in the rise of England as a naval power.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-spanish-want-to-invade-england>Why did the Spanish want to invade England?</h2>
<p>Spain was the richest and the most powerful Empire in Europe, and Phillip decided to invade England. He believed that it would help him secure many of Europe’s strategic objectives if he were successful. The Spanish presented the Armada as a Catholic crusade, and the Papacy partially funded it.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-spain-give-up-in-the-spanish-american-war>What did Spain give up in the Spanish American War?</h2>
<p>Spain relinquishes sovereignty over Cuba; cedes Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippine Islands to the United States. $20 million paid to Spain by the United States for infrastructure owned by Spain. The higher naval losses may be attributed to the disastrous naval defeats inflicted on the Spanish at Manila Bay and Santiago de Cuba.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-english-declare-war-on-spain-in-1585>Why did the English declare war on Spain in 1585?</h2>
<p>Philip took this to be an open declaration of war against his rule in the Netherlands. The Anglo-Spanish War broke out in 1585, following the seizure of English merchant ships in Spanish harbors. In response the English privy council immediately authorised a campaign against the Spanish fishing industry in Newfoundland and off the Grand Banks.</p>
