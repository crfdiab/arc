<h2 id=when-did-india-become-a-british-colony>When did India become a British colony?</h2>
<p>1858<br>
In 1858, British Crown rule was established in India, ending a century of control by the East India Company.</p>
<h2 id=which-are-the-british-colonies-in-india>Which are the British colonies in India?</h2>
<p>At the inception of the Raj in 1858, Lower Burma was already a part of British India; Upper Burma was added in 1886, and the resulting union, Burma (Myanmar), was administered as an autonomous province until 1937, when it became a separate British colony, gaining its own independence in 1948.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-british-colony-in-india>What was the first British colony in India?</h2>
<p>Surat<br>
The British first landed in India in Surat for the purpose of trade. Here’s how and why a simple trading company, the British East India Company, became one of the biggest challenges the subcontinent had ever dealt with. The British landed in India in Surat on August 24, 1608.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-was-india-colonized-by-the-british>How long was India colonized by the British?</h2>
<p>British raj, period of direct British rule over the Indian subcontinent from 1858 until the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-british-settlement-in-india>Where was the first British settlement in India?</h2>
<p>In 1608, Mughal authorities allowed the English East India Company to establish a small trading settlement at Surat (now in the state of Gujarat ), and this became the company’s first headquarters town.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-british-colonize-most-of-india>How did the British colonize most of India?</h2>
<p>They not only succeeded in controlling most of the Indian Territory, but also successfully colonized various aspects of the Indian society like culture, politics, economy and education. They have since become an inseparable part of our history.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-british-take-over-the-east-india-company>When did the British take over the East India Company?</h2>
<p>When the British Crown took over the government from the East India Company in 1858, Queen Victoria proclaimed the British would not interfere in Indian customs. But by 1870, the British had decided to act against female infanticide, and a bill was passed banning the practice.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-other-countries-that-were-part-of-british-india>Are there any other countries that were part of British India?</h2>
<p>British India did not apply to other countries in the region, such as Sri Lanka (then Ceylon ), which was a British Crown colony, or the Maldive Islands, which were a British protectorate.</p>
