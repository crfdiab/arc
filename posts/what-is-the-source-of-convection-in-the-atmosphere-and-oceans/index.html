<h2 id=what-is-the-source-of-convection-in-the-atmosphere-and-oceans>What is the source of convection in the atmosphere and oceans?</h2>
<p>Convection currents are the result of differential heating. Lighter (less dense), warm material rises while heavier (more dense) cool material sinks. It is this movement that creates circulation patterns known as convection currents in the atmosphere, in water, and in the mantle of Earth.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-source-of-energy-in-the-atmosphere>What is the main source of energy in the atmosphere?</h2>
<p>At the top of the atmosphere – Incoming energy from the sun balanced with outgoing energy from the earth.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-provides-the-energy-that-drives-convection-within-the-atmosphere-and-ocean>Which of the following provides the energy that drives convection within the atmosphere and ocean?</h2>
<p>The Sun provides the energy that drives convection within the atmosphere and oceans, producing winds and ocean currents.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-main-sources-of-energy>What are the two main sources of energy?</h2>
<p>There are two main sources of energy. They are conventional and non conventional sources of energy. i) Conventional sources of energy :- are wood, flowing water and fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas).</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-earth-atmosphere-energy-balance-achieved>How is the Earth-atmosphere energy balance achieved?</h2>
<p>The earth-atmosphere energy balance is achieved as the energy received from the Sun balances the energy lost by the Earth back into space. In this way, the Earth maintains a stable average temperature and therefore a stable climate. Using 100 units of energy from the sun as a baseline the energy balance is as follows:</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-energy-from-the-sea-come-from>Where does the energy from the sea come from?</h2>
<p>Energy from the sea is obtained in three different forms. They are Tidal energy, Sea wave energy and Ocean thermal energy. The periodic rise and fall of sea level due to gravitational attraction of the moon causes tides. A dam is constructed at a narrow opening between the land and sea.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-non-conventional-source-of-energy>Which is a non conventional source of energy?</h2>
<p>4) Non conventional sources of energy :- Solar energy is the energy obtained from the sun in the form of heat and light. The heat energy is used in solar heating devices like solar cooker, solar water heater, solar furnaces etc. The light energy is used in solar cells. The box type solar cooker has an insulated box painted black inside.</p>
