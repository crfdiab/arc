<h2 id=why-was-kublai-khan-successful-in-governing-china>Why was Kublai Khan successful in governing China?</h2>
<p>In deference to the learning and customs of the population under his control, Kublai surrounded himself with Chinese advisers and established a new northern capital called Shangdu. No mere bureaucrat, Kublai also helped his brother expand the empire with successful military campaigns of his own.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-kublai-khan-change-chinese-government>How did Kublai Khan change Chinese government?</h2>
<p>Kublai Khan changed the Chinese government by installing a dynasty of puppet emperors remembered as the Yuan Dynasty.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-kublai-khan-accepting-of-chinese-culture>How was Kublai Khan accepting of Chinese culture?</h2>
<p>Kublai Khan contributed to the fast growth of China’s economy by reopening and enhancing trade routes. He reformed China’s political structure to have a closed social hierarchy. His dynasty, the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), led to the development of Chinese literature and architectural style.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-kublai-khan-learn-from-his-mother>What did Kublai Khan learn from his mother?</h2>
<p>Kublai and his brothers were largely raised by their mother, an intelligent and tolerant woman who dedicated herself to her sons’ careers. Kublai was also exposed to Chinese philosophy and culture early on thanks to his mother, who also ensured that he learned to read and write Mongol (though he wasn’t taught Chinese).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-kublai-khan-change-the-government-of-china>How did Kublai Khan change the government of China?</h2>
<p>The correct answer is C. He only allowed members of his own family to hold official positions. Kublai Khan changed China’s government practice where under the rule of Kublai Khan, the grandson to Genghis Khan, the power and influence of the Mongols over China was absolute.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-kublai-khan-important-to-the-song-dynasty>Why was Kublai Khan important to the Song dynasty?</h2>
<p>With that prestige to back him, relying on his dominant personality, and building on the foundations of the brilliant civilization developed in China by the preceding Song dynasty (960–1279), Kublai could maintain the illusion for a while that Mongol supremacy was firmly based.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-arigboge-refuse-to-recognize-kublai-khan>Why did arigboge refuse to recognize Kublai Khan?</h2>
<p>Because primogeniture was not a recognized principle at that time, Arigböge, with some powerful supporters, held a kuriltai of his own at Karakorum (the original capital of the Mongol empire, now in northern Mongolia) and had himself declared khan, ignoring Kublai’s action.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-genghis-khan-and-his-grandson-kublai-khan-conquer>Where did Genghis Khan and his grandson Kublai Khan conquer?</h2>
<p>After uniting the individual nomadic tribes on the Mongolian plateau, Genghis Khan went on to conquer large portions of central Asia and China. By the time Genghis’ grandson Kublai was born in 1215, the Mongol empire stretched from the Caspian Sea east to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
