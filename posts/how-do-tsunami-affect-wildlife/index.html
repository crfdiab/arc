<h2 id=how-do-tsunami-affect-wildlife>How do tsunami affect wildlife?</h2>
<p>When tsunamis strike, birds and other small animals can be washed into the water and be unable to get back to dry land. Fishes are washed ashore where they suffocate because they can’t breathe outside of water. Some beaches are washed away, and freshwater habitats can be flooded with saltwater.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-earthquakes-affect-wildlife>How do earthquakes affect wildlife?</h2>

<h2 id=how-do-natural-disasters-affect-wildlife>How do natural disasters affect wildlife?</h2>
<p>Floods and wild fires are two of the most difficult occurrences for wild animals to survive. Fires that spread rapidly with powerful wind can be disorienting and sometimes impossible to escape. They also result in extensive damage to the natural habitat, which has long-term ramifications for the animals.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-earthquakes-affect-plant-and-animal-life>How do earthquakes affect plant and animal life?</h2>
