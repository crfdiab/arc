<h2 id=what-amendments-were-anti-federalists>What amendments were Anti-Federalists?</h2>
<p>The First Amendment Encyclopedia<br>
Anti-Federalists | The First Amendment Encyclopedia.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-anti-federalists-believe-was-needed>What did the Anti-Federalists believe was needed?</h2>
<p>On one side of the Constitution debate, anti-federalists wanted a small central government. They believed local governments best understood what citizens needed and would best protect citizens’ freedom. Anti-federalists opposed parts of the Constitution they thought limited the power of the states.</p>
<h2 id=did-anti-federalists-want-amendments>Did Anti-Federalists want amendments?</h2>
<p>Antifederalists wanted to amend the Constitution before it was implemented; while Federalists argued that amendments could best be considered only after experience under the Constitution demonstrated the need for change.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-anti-federalists-feel-the-bill-of-rights-was-necessary>Why did Anti-Federalists feel the Bill of Rights was necessary?</h2>
<p>Federalists argued that the Constitution did not need a bill of rights, because the people and the states kept any powers not given to the federal government. Anti-Federalists held that a bill of rights was necessary to safeguard individual liberty.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-federalists-support-amending-the-constitution-with-a-bill-of-rights>Why did the Federalists support amending the Constitution with a Bill of Rights?</h2>
<p>Bill of Rights was added to Constitution to ensure ratification. To ensure ratification of the document, the Federalists offered concessions, and the First Congress proposed a Bill of Rights as protection for those fearful of a strong national government.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-anti-federalists-think-about-the-constitution>What did Anti Federalists think about the Constitution?</h2>
<p>The anti-Federalists were chiefly concerned with too much power invested in the national government at the expense of states. (Howard Chandler Christy’s interpretation of the signing of the Constitution, painted in 1940.)</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-bill-of-rights-important-to-the-federalists>Why was the Bill of Rights important to the Federalists?</h2>
<p>One important issue is the Bill of Rights. The federalist when they were proposing the constitution and arguing for its ratification were opposed to a Bill of Rights. In fact, some of the time even made arguments it would be dangerous, it would be a bad thing. They also argued it was unnecessary.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-major-writers-of-the-anti-federalist-movement>Who are the major writers of the Anti Federalist Movement?</h2>
<p>Nonetheless, historians have concluded that the major Anti-Federalist writers included Robert Yates (Brutus), most likely George Clinton (Cato), Samuel Bryan (Centinel), and either Melancton Smith or Richard Henry Lee (Federal Farmer).</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-producers-of-the-federalists-vs-anti-federalists>Who are the producers of the Federalists vs Anti-Federalists?</h2>
