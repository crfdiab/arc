<h2 id=what-purpose-did-the-space-race-serve-the-united-states>What purpose did the Space Race serve the United States?</h2>
<p>Spaceflight series The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War adversaries, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), to achieve superior spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations following World War II.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-united-states-goal-in-the-space-race-brainly>What was the United States goal in the Space Race Brainly?</h2>
<p>The goal of the United States in the space race was to successfully land on the moon before the Soviets.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-mission-of-the-space-race>What was the mission of the Space Race?</h2>
<p>The Space Race was a 20th Century struggle between two nation-states, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US). The Space Race produced groundbreaking efforts to launch artificial satellites; space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human space voyages in low Earth orbit and lunar missions.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-winning-the-space-race-so-important-to-the-united-states-quizlet>Why was winning the Space Race so important to the United States quizlet?</h2>
<p>The space race is significant due to it’s role in the Cold War, a period of tension between the USA and USSR. The Space Race was considered an important part of the Cold War it showed the world which country had the best science, technology, and economic system.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-us-considered-to-have-won-the-space-race>Why is the US considered to have won the Space Race?</h2>
<p>By landing on the moon, the United States effectively “won” the space race that had begun with Sputnik’s launch in 1957. For their part, the Soviets made four failed attempts to launch a lunar landing craft between 1969 and 1972, including a spectacular launch-pad explosion in July 1969.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-us-space-policy-in-the-1960s>What was the US space policy in the 1960s?</h2>
<p>The early history of United States space policy is linked to the US–Soviet Space Race of the 1960s, which gave way to the Space Shuttle program. There is a current debate on the post-Space Shuttle future of the civilian space program.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-soviet-union-start-the-space-race>When did the Soviet Union start the Space Race?</h2>
<p>In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the satellite Sputnik, and the space race was on. The Soviets’ triumph jarred the American people and sparked a vigorous response in the federal government to make sure the United States did not fall behind its Communist rival.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-us-president-to-go-to-space>Who was the first US President to go to space?</h2>
<p>In general, Kennedy felt great pressure to have the United States “catch up to and overtake” the Soviet Union in the “space race.” Four years after the Sputnik shock of 1957, the cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had become the first human in space on April 12, 1961, greatly embarrassing the U.S.</p>
