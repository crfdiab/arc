<h2 id=does-smoking-affect-sleep>Does smoking affect sleep?</h2>
<p>While you’re smoking: Nicotine disrupts sleep – and smoking can also raise the risk of developing sleep conditions, such as sleep apnea. But since nicotine is a stimulant, smoking can mask your exhaustion. After all, if you’re feeling sleepy, a hit of nicotine can wake you up and make you feel alert the next day.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-factors-that-affect-your-sleep>What are the factors that affect your sleep?</h2>
<p>Factors that can cause sleep problems include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical disturbances (for example, chronic pain from arthritis, headaches, fibromyalgia)</li>
<li>Medical issues (for example, sleep apnea)</li>
<li>Psychiatric disorders (for example, depression and anxiety disorders)</li>
<li>Environmental issues (for example, it’s too bright, your partner snores)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sleep disturbances are a common side effect of nicotine withdrawal. New ex-smokers might sleep more than usual through this phase of smoking cessation.
