<h2 id=how-many-feet-of-snow-does-mount-everest-get-a-year>How many feet of snow does Mount Everest get a year?</h2>
<p>Basically here are the main problems as I see them which are that Chimborazo gets 310.5153 feet of snow, Kilimanjaro 158.9714 feet, “Antarctica” gets 107.3809 feet(it just says “Antarctica” but no specific location in Antarctica which makes that claim even more absurd) and Mount Everest with 101.350 feet of annual …</p>

<p>Winter<br>
Winter Weather at Everest: Winter weather (Nov to Feb) is dominated by the southward migration of the northern hemisphere jet stream which brings high winds, cold temperatures and on occasion heavy snow falls. Winter can be a great time for trekking as the crowds trying to avoid the cold clear out.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-summit-of-mount-everest-too-high-to-receive-snow>Is the summit of Mount Everest too high to receive snow?</h2>
<p>Not at all. The base camp at Mount Everest, at an altitude of 17,600 feet receives an average annual precipitation of 18” . Most cirrus clouds at this latitude, comprised of ice particles, are above this height. The monsoon season, in the summertime, can have clouds that readily exceed this height.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-mt-everest-compared-to-the-clouds>How tall is Mt Everest compared to the clouds?</h2>
<p>Clouds can form just above ground or at just about any level within the atmosphere. There are clouds far higher up than the top of mount Everest. Mt. Everest is 29,029 ft, whereas the highest clouds in that region reach 60,000 feet. The determining factor is a cloud on the ground is called fog.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-weather-like-on-mt-everest-in-may>What’s the weather like on Mt Everest in May?</h2>
<p>Mt. Everest is always covered in snow and ice. Many successful climbs to the summit happen in May. This is because the weather conditions are more favorable. The temperature on the mountain gets well below freezing at – 80oF (- 62oC) and the wind can blow at speeds of 200 mph (322 Km/hr).</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-have-summited-mount-everest-and-how-many-have-died>How many people have summited Mount Everest and how many have died?</h2>
<p>Some of the bodies have never been found, some serve as grim “markers” along the route, and some are only exposed years later when weather changes. As of January 2021 there have been 10,184 successful summits of Everest – some people have been multiple times so that makes 5,739 individuals. This info comes from the Himalayan Database.</p>
