<h2 id=what-is-the-employment-rate-of-germany>What is the employment rate of Germany?</h2>
<p>Employment Rate in Germany averaged 69.69 percent from 1992 until 2020, reaching an all time high of 77 percent in the third quarter of 2019 and a record low of 63.60 percent in the second quarter of 1997.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-civil-servants-are-there-in-germany>How many civil servants are there in Germany?</h2>
<p>Public servants have considerable social status in Germany. Civil servants are categorized into three groups. Slightly over 2 million are career civil servants (Beamten ; sing., Beamte ); about 3 million are employees (Angestellten ; sing., Angestellte ); and roughly 1.5 million are workers (Arbeiter ).</p>
<h2 id=does-germany-have-a-tight-or-loose-labour-market>Does Germany have a tight or loose Labour market?</h2>
<p>The German labor market is in good shape: unemployment is low, participation rates are high, and wages are increasing moderately. The labor market has also been remarkably robust to policy experiments, such as the introduction of a statutory minimum wage, and to demand side shocks, such as the Great Recession.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-civil-servant-and-public-servant>What’s the difference between civil servant and public servant?</h2>
<p>Civil servants include members of the government, members of various government’s department and members of embassies and consulates. Public servants include firefighters and police officers, but also volunteers and privates that provide services to the community and to the neediest segments of society.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-civil-servant-in-germany>What is a civil servant in Germany?</h2>
<p>The German word Beamter (female: Beamtin or Beamte, plural: Beamte) means civil servant, and is pronounced [bəˈʔamtɐ], with a glottal stop between the “e” and the “a”. However, unlike Beamte, judges are not subject to the usual hierarchy and order of command of government, in order to preserve judicial independence.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-non-eu-citizens-work-in-germany>How many non EU citizens work in Germany?</h2>
<p>The number of non-EU citizens with a work permit in Germany rose from 217,000 in 2017 to 266,000 in 2018. It is the third year in a row the number has risen by 20 percent. Most of the foreigners came from India (12%), China (9%), Bosnia and Herzegovina (8%), and the United States (7%).</p>
<h2 id=how-many-foreign-workers-are-there-in-germany>How many foreign workers are there in Germany?</h2>
<p>Germany is with a labour force of 45 million, including 3.3 million foreign employees, and with 1.2 million job vacancies the largest job market in Europe and one that is among the most open to foreign job seekers. To sustain the growth of the German economy the country needs foreign specialists of certain professions.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-can-you-make-working-in-germany>How much money can you make working in Germany?</h2>
<p>The starting salary of a graduate of mechanical or electrical engineering or a STEM graduate in general is in the range of 36,000 – 45,000 Euros a year and it is not uncommon for people with 15 years of experience in the field to earn 70,000 Euros a year. Who Can Get a Job in Germany?</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-unemployment-benefits-do-you-get-in-germany>What kind of unemployment benefits do you get in Germany?</h2>
<p>There are two types of unemployment benefit in Germany: unemployment benefit I and unemployment benefit II ( Arbeitslosengeld I and Arbeitslosengeld II ). Which one you receive depends on whether you have made contributions to statutory unemployment insurance, and how long you have been unemployed for.</p>
