<h2 id=do-people-live-near-the-yangtze-river>Do people live near the Yangtze River?</h2>
<p>People & Communities Today, the Yangtze region is home to more than 400 million people, or nearly one-third of China’s population. Some of China’s largest cities—Chengdu, Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai—are all located in the plains that adjoin the banks of the Yangtze River and its tributaries in the basin.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-yangtze-river-affect-people>How does the Yangtze River affect people?</h2>
<p>The 700,000-square-mile Yangtze River basin provides water, transport, and food for almost one-third of China’s 1.3 billion people and supplies more than 40% of the country’s GDP.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-humans-use-the-yangtze-river>How do humans use the Yangtze River?</h2>
<p>For thousands of years, the river has been used for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking and war. The prosperous Yangtze River Delta generates as much as 20% of China’s GDP. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-yangtze-river-turn-red>Why did the Yangtze River turn red?</h2>
<p>The Yangtze has also seen its fair share of scarlet waters. In 2012, the river mysteriously turned red. Scientists told Nature at the time the strange hue may have been caused by sediments flowing through the water, or even an unusually large algal bloom.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-and-effects-of-pollution-on-the-yangtze-river>What are the causes and effects of pollution on the Yangtze River?</h2>
<p>The answer is yes. Industrial wastewater discharge, agricultural chemical fertilizer, sediment accumulation, ship garbage and acid rain were the main Yangtze River pollution causes. Only in 2016, there were 35.32 billion ton waste water flowed into the Yangtze River.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-yellow-and-yangtze-rivers-affect-the-lives-of-people>How did the yellow and Yangtze rivers affect the lives of people?</h2>
<p>How did the Yellow and Yangtze rivers affect the life of people living near there? They provide enough irrigation water to the farmlands on both banks, bringing harvest for people. Some sections of both rivers have been developed into scenic areas attracting numerous visitors.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-animals-live-in-the-yangtze-river>How many animals live in the Yangtze River?</h2>
<p>It is a region of extremes which boasts an array of wildlife. The waters sustain animal and plant life in a 3.7 million square mile area. Every sized creature, from the tiniest fish to providing life to the bamboo forests that feed the giant panda, finds something to benefit from the Yangtze.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-water-quality-of-the-yangtze-river-good>Is the water quality of the Yangtze River good?</h2>
<p>The pollution of Yangtze River reduced and was improved in the past a few years. However, its water quality is still not as good as before and ecological system is still weak. Great efforts still need to be made to control and improve the pollution. – Last modified on Jan. 06, 2020 -.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-yangtze-river-start-and-end>Where does the Yangtze River start and end?</h2>
<p>The Yangtze is the world’s third longest river, running a 6,300-kilometer course that starts high in the Tibetan plateau and ends at the East China Sea near Shanghai. It is one of the world’s most ecologically and socio-economically critical rivers for biodiversity, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
