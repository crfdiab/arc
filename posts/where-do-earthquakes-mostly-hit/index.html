<h2 id=where-do-earthquakes-mostly-hit>Where do earthquakes mostly hit?</h2>
<p>The world’s greatest earthquake belt, the circum-Pacific seismic belt, is found along the rim of the Pacific Ocean, where about 81 percent of our planet’s largest earthquakes occur. It has earned the nickname “Ring of Fire”.</p>
<h2 id=which-belt-is-called-the-ring-of-fire>Which belt is called the Ring of Fire?</h2>
<p>The Ring of Fire, also referred to as the Circum-Pacific Belt, is a path along the Pacific Ocean characterized by active volcanoes and frequent earthquakes. The majority of Earth’s volcanoes and earthquakes take place along the Ring of Fire.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-earthquake-prone-state-in-the-world>Which is the most earthquake prone state in the world?</h2>
<p>In fact, according to a recent World Geological Survey, California is more than 99% likely to be hit by a big earthquake – one that ranks above a 6.7 magnitude – within the next 30 years. Although both cities are highly developed, neither are fully outfitted to face a quake without shaking.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-an-earthquake-occur-in-california>How often does an earthquake occur in California?</h2>
<p>There are over 500 active faults in California and most of its residents live within 30 miles of an active fault. 16 major earthquakes, of the magnitude 7 range, occur each year. The world’s greatest earthquake zone, the Circum-Pacific Seismic Belt, is found along the Pacific Ocean rim, where about 81% of the world’s largest earthquakes occur.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-killed-each-year-by-earthquakes>How many people are killed each year by earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Earthquakes kill roughly 20,000 people each year, on average. A new global mapping project shows which regions of the world are most at risk of earthquakes. 15 countries account for most of the death and destruction caused by quakes. Earthquakes kill, on average, about 20,000 people every year.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-earthquakes-occur-in-the-united-states>Where do earthquakes occur in the United States?</h2>
<p>The remaining shocks are scattered in various areas of the world. Earthquakes in these prominent seismic zones are taken for granted, but damaging shocks can occur outside these zones. Examples in the United States include New Madrid, Missouri (1811-1812) and Charleston, South Carolina (1886). However, many years usually elapse between such shocks.</p>
