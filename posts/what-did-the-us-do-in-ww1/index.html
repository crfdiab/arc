<h2 id=what-did-the-us-do-in-ww1>What did the US do in ww1?</h2>
<p>The Americans helped the British Empire, French and Portuguese forces defeat and turn back the powerful final German offensive (Spring Offensive of March to July, 1918), and most importantly, the Americans played a role in the Allied final offensive (Hundred Days Offensive of August to November).</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-us-choose-to-do-when-ww1-began>What did the US choose to do when ww1 began?</h2>
<p>At the start of the war, President Woodrow Wilson declared that the United States would be neutral. However, that neutrality was tested and fiercely debated in the U.S.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-world-war-1-affect-the-united-states>How did World war 1 affect the United States?</h2>
<p>However, there were also negative effects of the war. The war left US society in a hyper-vigilant mode, which led to outbreaks of violence against people who were viewed as disloyal to the United States. The people who suffered the most were German-Americans. Socialists and immigrants were also threatened and harassed.</p>
<h2 id=why-would-the-us-not-be-able-to-fight-in-wwi-in-1914>Why would the US not be able to fight in WWI in 1914?</h2>
<p>Q: Why did the United States choose to stay neutral in 1914? Put simply the United States did not concern itself with events and alliances in Europe and thus stayed out of the war. Wilson was firmly opposed to war, and believed that the key aim was to ensure peace, not only for the United States but across the world.</p>
<h2 id=could-the-united-states-have-avoided-entering-world-war-1>Could the United States have avoided entering world war 1?</h2>
<p>The U.S. could easily have avoided the war, if it chose to. When the war began in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson immediately declared U.S. neutrality. In 1916, he won another term with the slogan “He Kept Us Out of War.” Five months later, he declared war on Germany; Congress approved with 56 “No” votes.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-united-states-enter-world-war-1>Why did the United States enter World War 1?</h2>
<p>The U.S. entered World War I because Germany embarked on a deadly gamble. Germany sank many American merchant ships around the British Isles which prompted the American entry into the war. Rochester political scientist Hein Goemans answers the question why Germany was willing to risk American entry into the war. Woodrow Wilson did not want war.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-united-states-neutrality-in-world-war-1>Why was the United States neutrality in World War 1?</h2>
<p>For three years, the United States walked the tightrope of neutrality as President Woodrow Wilson opted to keep the country out of the bloodbath consuming Europe. Even as Germany’s campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic put American sailors and ships in jeopardy, the United States remained aloof.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-world-war-1-without-the-us>What was the outcome of World War 1 without the US?</h2>
<p>Without the backing of American weaponry, munitions and loans, the Allies would have been forced to abandon their goal of the knockout blow. The war might have ended in 1915 or 1916 with a negotiated peace based on the mutual admission that the conflict had become a stalemate.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-america-save-the-day-in-world-war-one>How did America save the day in World War One?</h2>
<p>The Americans saved Britain and France in the spring and summer and destroyed the German army in the fall.</p>
