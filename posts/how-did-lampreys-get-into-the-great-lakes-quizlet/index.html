<h2 id=how-did-lampreys-get-into-the-great-lakes-quizlet>How did lampreys get into the Great Lakes quizlet?</h2>
<p>Terms in this set (8) The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is a marine invader from the Atlantic Ocean that entered the Great Lakes through the ship canals and locks built to bypass obstacles like Niagara Falls. The sea lamprey was one of the first to invade the Great Lakes.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-sea-lamprey-get-to-ohio>How did sea lamprey get to Ohio?</h2>
<p>When the Welland Canal was completed in 1829, linking Lake Ontario with Lake Erie, it provided a corridor through which the sea lamprey was able to invade, but it took over a century for the first sea lamprey to be found in Lake Erie. The sea lamprey had successfully invaded the largest freshwater lake system on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-still-lampreys-in-lake-michigan>Are there still lampreys in Lake Michigan?</h2>
<p>According to Jones, sea lamprey remain in lakes Michigan and Ontario because others simply migrate in from the other lakes. Eradication efforts would need to be basin wide, but the most widespread method of removing lamprey, poisons called lampricides, don’t work in every stream lamprey occupy.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-you-think-the-sea-lamprey-is-considered-such-a-problem-in-the-great-lakes>Why do you think the sea lamprey is considered such a problem in the Great Lakes?</h2>
<p>The sea lamprey is considered a problem in the Great Lakes because the sea lamprey feed off of the lake trout. Without the lake trout, the population goes down making it hard for fishermen to sell the fish. The Sea Lamprey live near the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-sea-lamprey-get-to-the-great-lakes>How did the sea lamprey get to the Great Lakes?</h2>
<p>Niagara Falls acted as a natural barrier preventing sea Lamprey movement to Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior. However, when the Welland Canal (constructed to bypass the falls) was deepened in 1919, sea lampreys gained access to the rest of the Great Lakes. By 1938, they had invaded all of the Great Lakes.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-pounds-of-fish-does-a-sea-lamprey-kill>How many pounds of fish does a sea lamprey kill?</h2>
<p>One lamprey kills about 40 pounds of fish every year. Sea lampreys invaded the Great Lakes in the 1830s via the Welland Canal, which connects Lakes Ontario and Erie and forms a key section of the St. Lawrence Seaway.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-silver-lamprey-a-special-concern>What makes a silver lamprey a special concern?</h2>
<p>“Special concern” means the species lives in the wild in Ontario, is not endangered or threatened, but may become threatened or endangered due to a combination of biological characteristics and identified threats. The silver lamprey is an eel-shaped fish with a sucking disc mouth. Like all lampreys, it does not have jaws or paired fins.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-find-silver-lamprey-in-canada>Where can you find silver lamprey in Canada?</h2>
<p>Outside Ontario, the silver lamprey is found in tributaries that feed the St. Lawrence River in Quebec and New York west through to Manitoba and tributaries of the Nelson River. Silvery lampreys are also found in the upper Mississippi River tributaries.</p>
