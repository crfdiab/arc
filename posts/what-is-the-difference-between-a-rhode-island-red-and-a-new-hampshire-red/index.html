<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-rhode-island-red-and-a-new-hampshire-red>What is the difference between a Rhode Island Red and a New Hampshire Red?</h2>
<p>The New Hampshire Red differs from the Rhode Island in that it produces more meat (and therefore fewer eggs), it’s faster to grow and feather out, it matures early and it’s even more vigorous.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-you-tell-a-rhode-island-red-chicken>How can you tell a Rhode Island Red chicken?</h2>
<p>A full-grown Rhode Island Red hen will weigh about 6.5 pounds and have yellow legs and feet, red/orange eyes, and a red/brown beak. Their color will vary from darker red/brown to a light rust, and some hens will exhibit dark black/green tail feathers.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-chickens-make-a-rhode-island-red>What two chickens make a Rhode Island Red?</h2>
<p>The Rhode Island Red was bred in Rhode Island and Massachusetts in the second half of the nineteenth century, by selective breeding of birds of Oriental origin such as the Cochin, Java, Malay and Shanghai with brown Leghorn birds from Italy. The characteristic deep red plumage derived from the Malay.</p>
<h2 id=what-color-is-nh-chicken>What color is NH chicken?</h2>
<p>The New Hampshire chicken is a beautiful relatively new breed of chickens. They have a distinct red-brown color. The New Hampshire chicken is often compared to the Rhode Island Red chicken and it is sometimes overshadowed by that breed. The New Hampshire chicken is considered to be a dual-purpose hen.</p>
<h2 id=are-rhode-island-reds-aggressive>Are Rhode Island Reds aggressive?</h2>
<p>Temperament & Personality The Rhode Island Red chicken breed has a reputation for being somewhat aggressive and remarkably territorial -this is especially true among the roosters. While hens aren’t known for being overly antagonistic, they can be ornery toward each other.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-life-expectancy-of-a-rhode-island-red-chicken>What is the life expectancy of a Rhode Island Red chicken?</h2>
<p>around five years<br>
Health. These birds have a reputation of being one of the hardiest breeds and are good doers. While they live around five years, hens lay well for only three. Regular worming and vaccinations required.</p>
<h2 id=are-rhode-island-reds-noisy>Are Rhode Island Reds noisy?</h2>
<p>#17 Rhode Island Reds are noisy. These birds are noisy before, during, and after egg-laying. They are very intense when preparing to lay an egg, and make extremely loud, agitated squawking noises pretty much non-stop. I love the noises they make—they are certainly expressive.</p>
<h2 id=at-what-age-do-new-hampshire-reds-start-laying>At what age do New Hampshire Reds start laying?</h2>
<p>Most non-hybrids start laying at 5 to 7 months of age. These include New Hampshire Reds, Black Australorps, Buff Orpingtons, Barred Rocks, Wyandottes, and many of our other breeds.</p>
<h2 id=are-nh-chickens-aggressive>Are NH chickens aggressive?</h2>
<p>The New Hampshire is a family friendly bird, making great pets as they are easy to tame. As a medium sized bird, they can be quite food aggressive and are willing to push and shove flock mates out of the way; certainly not a good thing if you have shy, docile breeds already.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meanest-chicken-breed>What is the meanest chicken breed?</h2>
<p>Malay Roosters. Malay chickens were originally brought to England from India and Asia. They were bred to be cockfighting birds and so are generally very aggressive. They are perhaps the most aggressive breed of chickens, although the English Game can compete with them.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-red-does-a-new-hampshire-chicken-have>What kind of red does a New Hampshire chicken have?</h2>
<p>The mature birds are a rich chestnut red, of a somewhat lighter and more even shade than the Rhode Island Reds. The chicks are also a lighter red. The New Hampshire was developed in 1915 from a strain of Rhode Island Red brought into New Hampshire state.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-rhode-island-and-new-hampshire-chicken>What’s the difference between Rhode Island and New Hampshire chicken?</h2>
<p>Although it is a direct descendant from the Rhode Island Red chicken, the New Hampshire chicken’s feather coloration and positioning are different. The Rhode Island Red chicken has a darker reddish-brown color and the New Hampshire chicken has a golden color with yellow highlights.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-does-a-rhode-island-red-chicken-get>How big does a Rhode Island Red Chicken get?</h2>
<p>The Rhode Island Red chicken has a darker reddish-brown color and the New Hampshire chicken has a golden color with yellow highlights. The New Hampshire chicken weighs 6 – 8 pounds. There is a bantam version of this breed available. The bantam weighs between 30 – 34 ounces. There are two additional varieties of the New Hampshire chicken:</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-new-hampshire-chicken-come-from>Where did the New Hampshire chicken come from?</h2>
<p>It was developed in New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a separate strain of Rhode Island Red chickens. Around 1910 or so, poultry breeders of New Hampshire were selecting hens for faster feathering, faster growth and maturity from the Rhode Island Red strains that were around at the time.</p>
