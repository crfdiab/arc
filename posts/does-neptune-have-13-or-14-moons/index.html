<h2 id=does-neptune-have-13-or-14-moons>Does Neptune have 13 or 14 moons?</h2>
<p>Neptune, the farthest planet from the sun, has 14 known moons. Almost half of the discoveries took place decades after NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft swung by the planet and its system, demonstrating just how far telescope technology has progressed. (One moon was also spotted in 2013 after being lost for nearly 25 years.)</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-moon-on-neptune>What is the biggest moon on Neptune?</h2>
<p>Triton<br>
Triton is the largest of Neptune’s 13 moons. It is unusual because it is the only large moon in our solar system that orbits in the opposite direction of its planet’s rotation―a retrograde orbit.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-neptunes-4-biggest-moons>What are Neptune’s 4 biggest moons?</h2>
<p>Neptune Moons</p>
<ul>
<li>Proteus was discovered in 1989 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft.</li>
<li>Psamathe was discovered by Scott S.</li>
<li>Sao was discovered Aug.</li>
<li>Thalassa was discovered in August 1989 in images taken by Voyager 2.</li>
<li>Triton is the only known satellite in our solar system to have a surface made mainly of nitrogen ice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=does-neptune-have-67-moons>Does Neptune have 67 moons?</h2>
<p>Many of the planets of our solar system have moons. Neptune has 14 moons.</p>
<h2 id=what-planet-has-4-rings-13-moons>What planet has 4 rings 13 moons?</h2>
<p>Uranus<br>
Neptune has six known rings, and Uranus has 13 known rings. While scientists don’t know for sure how many rings Saturn has, they believe it’s in the region of 500 to 1,000. By contrast, only four rings have been identified around Jupiter.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-moons-does-neptune-have-in-the-solar-system>How many moons does Neptune have in the Solar System?</h2>
<p>Neptune takes 164 years to orbit around the Sun once. Neptune is the furthest away planet in our solar system, and has 14 moons. Neptune’s largest moon is called Triton, and is named after the Greek god of the ocean (Neptune is the name for the Roman god of the ocean). Triton was discovered by William Lassell, an English astronomer.</p>

<h2 id=how-is-the-orbit-of-triton-different-from-other-moons-of-neptune>How is the orbit of Triton different from other moons of Neptune?</h2>
<p>The orbit of Triton (red) is different from most moons’ orbit (green) in the orbit’s direction, and the orbit is tilted −23°. Triton follows a retrograde and quasi-circular orbit, and is thought to be a gravitationally captured satellite.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-moons-in-the-outer-solar-system>Are there any moons in the outer Solar System?</h2>
<p>In the outer solar system, the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune have dozens of moons. As these planets grew in the early solar system, they were able to capture smaller objects with their large gravitational fields.</p>
