<h2 id=is-compact-fluorescent-lamp-dangerous>Is Compact Fluorescent Lamp dangerous?</h2>
<p>Compact fluorescent lamps (CFL), commonly known as energy-saving lamps are identified by their fluorescent tube bent onto itself or even wrapped. These bulbs use less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs, they contain mercury, a substance that can be harmful to humans and to the environment.</p>
<h2 id=do-compact-fluorescent-bulbs-smell-when-they-burn-out>Do compact fluorescent bulbs smell when they burn out?</h2>
<p>Expect the light to dim as it nears its end. When it does burn out, expect a dramatic pop and a distinct odor. The CFL bulb might even produce smoke while the base of the bulb turns black.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-cause-a-fluorescent-light-to-smoke>What would cause a fluorescent light to smoke?</h2>
<p>Usually smoke coming from a fluorescent fixture is a sign that the ballast is toast. The ballast is behind the sheetmetal reflector that is itself behind (above) the bulbs.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-dispose-of-compact-fluorescent-light-bulbs>How do you dispose of compact fluorescent light bulbs?</h2>
<p>The EPA recommends that you bring old CFLs to qualified recyclers, rather than disposing of them in trash cans or curbside recycling bins. You can bring old CFLs to The Home Depot for free recycling. Visit the Eco Options website to learn more. If you’re concerned about the mercury content in CFLs, consider LED bulbs.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-my-fluorescent-lights-smell>Why do my fluorescent lights smell?</h2>
<p>A common source of these odors is the fluorescent light ballast. When called to such an incident, you typically will find an electrical odor or a haze of smoke. Overheating ballasts give off a distinctive odor; with experience, you will learn to easily recognize the odor at subsequent incidents.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-inhale-mercury-from-a-light-bulb>What happens if you inhale mercury from a light bulb?</h2>
<p>Mercury in CFLs are present as elemental (or metallic) mercury. Once inhaled, the mercury vapor can damage the central nervous system, kidneys, and liver. These toxic effects are why any mercury spill should be handled carefully, including one that results from a CFL breaking.</p>
<h2 id=can-fluorescent-light-bulbs-catch-on-fire>Can fluorescent light bulbs catch on fire?</h2>
<p>Overheated fluorescent lights can cause fires! Overheating of the ballast could result in the following: Ignition of nearby combustible materials. Explosion of the ballast due to the generation of gases inside.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-my-light-smoking>Why is my light smoking?</h2>
<p>This is because the voltage coming into the lamp is converted, and the proper wattage of the lightbulb is going to help things function as they should. When you put a lightbulb with the wrong wattage into a lamp or use a light fixture not rated for the voltage you are using, you could experience smoke.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-get-mercury-poisoning-from-broken-thermometer>Can you get mercury poisoning from broken thermometer?</h2>
<p>Some thermometers and light bulbs contain very small amounts of mercury. If you break one, it’s unlikely to cause any health problems. However, you should avoid contact with the mercury and take extra care when cleaning it up.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-do-with-old-compact-fluorescent>What do you do with old compact fluorescent?</h2>
<h2 id=why-do-compact-fluorescent-light-bulbs-burn-out>Why do compact fluorescent light bulbs burn out?</h2>
<p>Why do compact fluorescent bulbs burn out? CFLs are admittedly more finicky than incandescent bulbs. Some of the factors that can cause them to burn out early include vibrations, temperature, enclosures, use with incompatible dimmers, poor base contact with the fixture, and fluctuations in power.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-cfl-and-an-incandescent-bulb>What’s the difference between a CFL and an incandescent bulb?</h2>
<p>For energy efficiency of other light sources, see Luminous efficacy. A compact fluorescent lamp ( CFL ), also called compact fluorescent light, energy-saving light and compact fluorescent tube, is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent light bulb; some types fit into light fixtures designed for incandescent bulbs.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-light-bulb-is-a-compact-fluorescent>What kind of light bulb is a compact fluorescent?</h2>
<p>What are they? The compact fluorescent light bulb or lamp is a type of fluorescent lamp generally designed as a replacement for incandescent or halogen lamps. There are two major types of compact fluorescent lamp, screw-in and plug-in.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-dispose-of-compact-fluorescent-lamps>Is it safe to dispose of compact fluorescent lamps?</h2>
<p>Like all fluorescent lamps, CFLs contain toxic mercury which complicates their disposal. In many countries, governments have banned the disposal of CFLs together with regular garbage. These countries have established special collection systems for CFLs and other hazardous waste.</p>
