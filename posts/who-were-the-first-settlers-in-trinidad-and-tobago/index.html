<h2 id=who-were-the-first-settlers-in-trinidad-and-tobago>Who were the first settlers in Trinidad and Tobago?</h2>
<p>Christopher Columbus landed on Trinidad, which he named for the Holy Trinity, in 1498 and found a land quietly inhabited by the Arawak and Carib Indians. It was nearly a century later that Europeans began to settle Trinidad (called “leri&—land of the hummingbird—by the Amerindians).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-british-settle-in-trinidad>When did the British settle in Trinidad?</h2>
<p>1802<br>
Trinidad remained in the hands of the Spanish from the 15th Century until the British captured it in 1797 – we then became a British colony in 1802.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-colonizers-of-trinidad-and-tobago>Who were the colonizers of Trinidad and Tobago?</h2>
<p>Columbus discovered Trinidad and Tobago on his third voyage in 1498. Trinidad was inhabited by the Arawak Indians, who were killed by early European settlers. It was colonized by the Spanish in 1592. It continued under Spanish rule until 1797, when it was captured by the British.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-slaves-arrive-in-trinidad>When did the first slaves arrive in Trinidad?</h2>
<p>1606<br>
In 1606, four hundred and seventy (470) enslaved Africans were brought to Trinidad by Dutch slaver Isaac Duverne. This was the first recorded instance of enslaved Africans being brought to the island.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-chinese-came-to-trinidad>Why did the Chinese came to Trinidad?</h2>
<p>Between 1853 and 1866 2,645 Chinese immigrants arrived in Trinidad as indentured labour for the sugar and cacao plantations. Immigration peaked in the first half of the twentieth century, but was sharply curtailed after the Chinese Revolution in 1949.</p>
<h2 id=who-came-to-trinidad-first>Who came to Trinidad first?</h2>
<p>The history of Trinidad and Tobago begins with the settlements of the islands by Indigenous First Peoples. Both islands were visited by Christopher Columbus on his third voyage in 1498 and claimed in the name of Spain. Trinidad remained in Spanish hands until 1797, but it was largely settled by French colonists.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-someone-from-trinidad>What do you call someone from Trinidad?</h2>
<p>Trinidadians and Tobagonians, colloquially known as Trinis or Trinbagonians, are the people who are identified with the country of Trinidad and Tobago. The country is home to people of many different national, ethnic and religious origins.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-dr-eric-williams>Who was Dr Eric Williams?</h2>
<p>Eric Williams, in full Eric Eustace Williams, (born Sept. 25, 1911, Port of Spain, Trinidad—died March 29, 1981, St. Anne, near Port of Spain), first and longtime prime minister of independent Trinidad and Tobago (1962–81), who founded (1956) the People’s National Movement (PNM) and led his country to independence.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-trinidad-and-tobago-become-a-british-colony>When did Trinidad and Tobago become a British colony?</h2>
<p>Trinidad thus became a British crown colony, with a French-speaking population and Spanish laws. British rule was formalized under the Treaty of Amiens (1802). British rule led to an influx of settlers from the United Kingdom and the British colonies of the Eastern Caribbean.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-first-settlers-of-trinidad-and-tobago>Who are the first settlers of Trinidad and Tobago?</h2>
<p>The earliest settlers, termed Archaic or Ortoiroid, are believed to have settled Trinidad and Tobago from northeastern South America around 4000 BCE.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-live-in-the-uk-from-trinidad-and-tobago>How many people live in the UK from Trinidad and Tobago?</h2>
<p>The UK and Trinidad and Tobago maintain close links, especially since Trinidad and Tobago was once part of the British Empire and remains in the Commonwealth of Nations . 21,283 Trinidad and Tobago-born people were living in the UK at the time of the 2001 Census.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-barrancoids-settle-in-trinidad-and-tobago>Where did the barrancoids settle in Trinidad and Tobago?</h2>
<p>After 250 CE a third group, called the Barrancoid people settled in southern Trinidad and Tobago after migrating up the Orinoco River toward the sea. The oldest Barrancoid settlement appears to have been at Erin, on the south coast.</p>
