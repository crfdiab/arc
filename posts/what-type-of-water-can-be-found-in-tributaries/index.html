<h2 id=what-type-of-water-can-be-found-in-tributaries>What type of water can be found in tributaries?</h2>
<p>freshwater stream<br>
A tributary is a freshwater stream that feeds into a larger stream or river. The larger, or parent, river is called the mainstem. The point where a tributary meets the mainstem is called the confluence. Tributaries, also called affluents, do not flow directly into the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-tributaries-be-found>Where can tributaries be found?</h2>
<p>A tributary is a river or stream that flows into another river. The Mississippi River flows into the Gulf of Mexico, but there are lots of other rivers, or tributaries, that flow into the Mississippi. For example, the Missouri River and the Ohio River are both tributaries of the Mississippi River.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-example-of-a-tributary-river>What is an example of a tributary river?</h2>
<p>The Vermillion River (and its forks) is a highlighted example of a tributary of the Wabash River. The Wabash River is also a tributary of the Ohio River, which in turn is a tributary of the Mississippi river. The Yamuna is the second largest tributary river of the Ganges and the longest tributary in India.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-difference-between-river-and-tributaries>What is difference between river and tributaries?</h2>
<p>is that river is a large and often winding stream which drains a land mass, carrying water down from higher areas to a lower point, ending at an ocean or in an inland sea or river can be one who rives or splits while tributary is (senseid) a river that flows into a larger river or other body of water.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-tributaries-of-ganga>What are the major tributaries of Ganga?</h2>
<p>The important tributaries are the Yamuna, the Ramaganga, the Gomti, the Ghagra, the Son, the Gandak, the Burhi Gandak, the Kosi and the Mahananda. At Farakka in West Bengal, the river divides into two arms namely the Padma which flows to Bangladesh and the Bhagirathi which flows through West Bengal.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-tributaries-of-a-river-classified>How are the tributaries of a river classified?</h2>
<p>There are two leading methods geographers and potamologist s (people who study rivers) use to classify tributaries. The first method lists a river’s tributaries starting with those closest to the source, or headwater s, of the river.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-receiving-water-into-which-a-tributary-feeds>Which is the receiving water into which a tributary feeds?</h2>
<p>The receiving water into which a tributary feeds is called the “mainstem,” and the point where they come together is referred to as the “confluence.” Each tributary drains a different watershed into the mainstem, contributing to the mainstem’s larger overall watershed. “Left bank” and “right bank” tributaries are designated based on…</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-tributary-in-california>Which is an example of a tributary in California?</h2>
<p>Examples of Tributaries in California. The Feather River is the largest tributary of the Sacramento River and it acts as the main water source for the State Water Project, serving as an example of a tributary that generates a lot of water and has several tributaries of its own.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-tributaries-important-to-the-mainstem>Why are tributaries important to the mainstem?</h2>
<p>Tributaries serve as important habitats and carry various sediment, chemicals, organic matter and volumes of water that contribute to unique conditions that support various species. As tributaries merge to the mainstem, they can introduce both vital ecological components and dangerous contaminants at their confluences.</p>
