<h2 id=how-did-the-great-depression-affect-rural-vs-urban-areas>How did the Great Depression affect rural vs urban areas?</h2>
<p>From industrial strongholds to the rural Great Plains, from factory workers to farmers, the Great Depression affected millions. In cities, as industry slowed, then sometimes stopped altogether, workers lost jobs and joined breadlines, or sought out other charitable efforts.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-depression-affect-rural-america>How did the Great Depression affect rural America?</h2>
<p>The Depression changed the lives of people who lived throughout rural America. Farm families raised most of their own food – eggs and chickens, milk, meat from their own pigs and cows, and vegetables from carefully tended gardens. Tragically many farm families did, this include both farm owners and share croppers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-depression-affect-the-urban-people>How did the Great Depression affect the urban people?</h2>
<p>THE DEPRESSION IN THE CITIES In cities across the country, people lost their jobs, were evicted from their homes and ended up in the streets. They also dealt with increasing racial violence from unemployed whites competing for the same jobs. Twenty-four African Americans died by lynching in 1933.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-depression-affect-the-lives-of-americans-quizlet>How did the Great Depression affect the lives of Americans quizlet?</h2>
<p>The Great Depression affected the daily lives of average Americans by causing them to be unemployed. People who had homes or apartments became homeless because they had no money to pay rent. Families fell apart when the husbands would leave to go search for jobs. Many suffered depression and committed suicide.</p>
<h2 id=what-will-eventually-pull-america-out-of-the-great-depression>What will eventually pull America out of the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>Mobilizing the economy for world war finally cured the depression. Millions of men and women joined the armed forces, and even larger numbers went to work in well-paying defense jobs. World War Two affected the world and the United States profoundly; it continues to influence us even today.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-rural-areas-during-the-great-depression>What was life like in rural areas during the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>In rural areas, many banks failed — went bankrupt and closed — because they were unable to collect anything of value on loans they had made to farmers. Anyone who had money in these banks lost their savings. For farmers and farm communities, the Great Depression began in the 1920s.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-most-important-as-a-cause-of-the-stock-market-crash-of-1929>What was most important as a cause of the stock market crash of 1929?</h2>
<p>Among the other causes of the stock market crash of 1929 were low wages, the proliferation of debt, a struggling agricultural sector and an excess of large bank loans that could not be liquidated.</p>
<h2 id=what-industry-was-most-affected-by-the-great-depression>What industry was most affected by the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>Industries that suffered the most included agriculture, mining, logging, durable goods, construction, and automobiles. The depression caused major political changes including President Herbert Hoover’s loss in the presidential election of 1932 to Franklin Roosevelt.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-urban-areas-during-the-great-depression>What was life like in urban areas during the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>However, life in the urban areas faced struggles like very high unemployment rates, lack of places to live, scarcity of food, and higher crime rates. Since many people did not have money to afford their homes, they sought out to live in “Hoovervilles” which were make shift shacks placed on the outskirts of the cities.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-depression-affect-farmers-and-cities>How did the Great Depression affect farmers and cities?</h2>
<p>The Great Depression Hits Farms and Cities in the 1930s Farmers struggled with low prices all through the 1920s, but after 1929 things began to be hard for city workers as well. After the stock market crash, many businesses started to close or to lay off workers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-depression-affect-the-united-states>How did the Great Depression affect the United States?</h2>
<p>The Great Depression of 1929 devastated the U.S. economy. Half of all banks failed. Unemployment rose to 25 percent and homelessness increased. Housing prices plummeted 30 percent, international trade collapsed by 60 percent, and prices fell 10 percent.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-drought-start-in-the-great-depression>When did the drought start in the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>Beginning in 1932, severe droughts hit from Texas to the Dakotas and lasted until at least 1936. The droughts compounded years of agricultural mismanagement. To grow their crops, Plains farmers had plowed up natural ground cover that had taken ages to form over the surface of the dry Plains states.</p>
