<h2 id=was-there-a-general-main-in-the-civil-war>Was there a general Main in the Civil War?</h2>
<p>There were hundreds of generals commissioned in the American Civil War on both the Union and Confederate armies. Some, like Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman are household names.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-original-purpose-of-fighting-the-civil-war>What was the original purpose of fighting the Civil War?</h2>
<p>In the South, most slaves did not hear of the proclamation for months. But the purpose of the Civil War had now changed. The North was not only fighting to preserve the Union, it was fighting to end slavery. Throughout this time, northern black men had continued to pressure the army to enlist them.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-gentlemans-agreement-that-ended-the-civil-war>Where was the gentleman’s agreement that ended the Civil War?</h2>
<p>On April 9, 1865, a lone Confederate horseman violently waving a white towel (above) as a flag of truce galloped up to the men of the 118th Pennsylvania Infantry near Appomattox Court House and asked for directions to the headquarters of Major General Philip Sheridan. (National Museum of American History)</p>

<h2 id=how-did-general-grant-and-general-lee-end-the-civil-war>How did General Grant and General Lee end the Civil War?</h2>
<p>When Generals Grant and Lee sat down at Appomattox Court House, they brought an end to the struggle that had consumed the nation for five long years The two commanders sat across from each other; Lee in a tall caned armchair and Grant in a swivel chair with a padded leather back next to a small oval side table.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-civil-war>What was the outcome of the Civil War?</h2>
