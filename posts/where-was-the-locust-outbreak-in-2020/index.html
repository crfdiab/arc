<h2 id=where-was-the-locust-outbreak-in-2020>Where was the locust outbreak in 2020?</h2>
<p>Ravenous locust swarm clouds more than three times the size of New York City descended in northeast Kenya, which is battling its worst infestation in 70 years. In the Wachile region of Ethiopia, locust swarms forced more than 15,000 people to evacuate their homes in May.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-is-having-a-problem-with-locusts>What country is having a problem with locusts?</h2>
<p>In 2020, locusts have swarmed in large numbers in dozens of countries, including Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia, Eritrea, India, Pakistan, Iran, Yemen, Oman and Saudi Arabia. When swarms affect several countries at once in very large numbers, it is known as a plague.</p>
<h2 id=which-places-are-attacked-by-locust>Which places are attacked by locust?</h2>
<p>Currently, the locust invasion is most serious in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, southern Iran and in parts of Pakistan and starting in June, it will move from Kenya to throughout Ethiopia, as well as to Sudan and perhaps West Africa.</p>
<h2 id=which-state-was-warned-of-a-locust-attack>Which state was warned of a locust attack?</h2>
<p>The Locust Warning Organisation, which falls under the Ministry of Agriculture, works towards controlling locusts in India. Dr KL Gurjar, deputy director, Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), informed: “Locust attacks in India are restricted to Rajasthan and Gujarat. These are desert locusts that come over from Pakistan.</p>
<h2 id=what-the-bible-says-about-locust>What the Bible Says About locust?</h2>
<p>The Book of Exodus, Chapter 10, Verse 4 says, If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow. Exodus 10:12 says, And the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail.”</p>
<h2 id=is-locust-attack-a-biological-disaster>Is locust attack a biological disaster?</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Home Affairs has now identified locust attacks as a natural disaster and has directed states to undertake relief operations under the State Disaster Response Fund as per established procedure and the norms for assistance.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-worst-locust-attack-in-decades-has-invaded-north-india>Why the worst locust attack in decades has invaded north India?</h2>
<p>Experts attribute the current deep invasion of locusts to the fact that while rabi crops have been harvested, kharif sowing is yet to begin. The low availability of crops is leading the swarms to devour leaves on trees, and vegetable, fruit and cotton crops, and move deeper into India in search of fodder.</p>
