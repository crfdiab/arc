<h2 id=where-were-the-first-settlers-in-maryland-from>Where were the first settlers in Maryland from?</h2>
<p>Who Founded Maryland? The idea for an English colony along the Chesapeake Bay where Catholics could live and worship in peace came from George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore. In 1632, he received a charter from King Charles I to found a colony east of the Potomac River.</p>
<h2 id=what-nationality-was-the-maryland-colony>What nationality was the Maryland Colony?</h2>
<p>British<br>
The Province of Maryland was an English and later British colony in North America that existed from 1632 until 1778, when it joined the other twelve of the Thirteen Colonies in rebellion against Great Britain and became the U.S. state of Maryland.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-settlers-of-maryland-come-from>Where did the first settlers of Maryland come from?</h2>
<p>As did other colonies, Maryland used the headright system to encourage people to bring in new settlers. Led by Leonard Calvert, Cecil Calvert’s younger brother, the first settlers departed from Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, on November 22, 1633, aboard two small ships, the Ark and the Dove.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-people-lived-in-the-maryland-colony>What kind of people lived in the Maryland colony?</h2>
<p>French, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, Swedish, in addition to English. Maryland was uniquely created as a colony for Catholic aristocracy and gentry, but Anglicanism eventually came to dominate, partly through influence from neighboring Virginia.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-british-immigrants-come-to-maryland>How did the British immigrants come to Maryland?</h2>
<p>Nearly all British immigrants to colonial Maryland came either as servants or convicts. Maryland received more indentured servants than any other colony. In Maryland, it was popular to name tracts of land. English colonists often named their tract after their place of origin in the old country. This was a common practice up through the mid 1700s.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-lord-of-the-maryland-colony>Who was the First Lord of the Maryland colony?</h2>
<p>The first Lord Baltimore, a proud Catholic, envisioned the Maryland Colony as a place where English people would have religious freedom. He also wished to found the colony for economic gain.
