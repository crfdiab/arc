<h2 id=what-would-the-son-of-an-earl-be-called>What would the son of an earl be called?</h2>
<p>The younger sons of earls are styled “Honourable”; all the daughters are styled “Lady.” In formal documents and instruments, the sovereign, when addressing or mentioning any earl, usually designates him “trusty and well-beloved cousin,” a form first adopted by Henry IV.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-an-earl-and-a-duke>What is the difference between an earl and a duke?</h2>
<p>According to Debrett’s, “Earl is the third rank of the Peerage, standing above the ranks of viscount and baron, but below duke and marquess.” So, if you’re looking to marry an eligible royal, an earl might be your best pretty solid bet – although ranking-wise a duke or marquess would be more impressive.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-higher-duke-or-earl>Who is higher duke or earl?</h2>
<p>The five titles of the peerage, in descending order of precedence, or rank, are: duke, marquess, earl, viscount, baron. The highest rank of the peerage, duke, is the most exclusive.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-earls-left>Are there any Earls left?</h2>
<p>At present there are 191 earls (not including the Earl of Wessex and courtesy earldoms), and four countesses in their own right. The premier earl of England and Ireland is the Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford (created 1442). The most recent earldom to be created is Stockton, created in 1984.</p>
<h2 id=do-lords-and-ladies-still-exist>Do lords and ladies still exist?</h2>
<p>To start with, Lords and Ladies of Parliament are no longer chosen by the Monarch, though the Monarch’s consent much be sought as the font of all honours in the UK as the peerage will be issued by letters patent in the name of Her Majesty, but are chosen by a special committee who find the very best people to sit in …</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-original-singer-of-duke-of-earl>Who was the original singer of Duke of Earl?</h2>
<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ” Duke of Earl ” is a 1962 US number-one song, originally by Gene Chandler. It is the best known of Chandler’s songs, and he subsequently dubbed himself “The Duke of Earl”. The song was penned by Chandler, Bernice Williams, and Earl Edwards.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-duke-a-prince-and-an-earl>What’s the difference between a Duke, a prince and an Earl?</h2>
<p>Royal titles for men explained TITLES like ‘prince’, ‘duke’ and ‘earl’ aren’t just fancy names given to royals and their extended family members. They belong to a ranking system for British nobility known as the peerage. Here’s what you need to know. What is the peerage system and which titles belong to it?</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-earls-and-dukes-of-somerset>Who are the Earls and Dukes of Somerset?</h2>
<p>EARLS AND DUKES OF. SOMERSET In the 11th century Somerset and Dorset were under the jurisdiction of one sheriff, and for a considerable period titles derived from each of these shires were borne by the same person. (See Dorset, Earls, MARgUESSES AND Dukes Of.)</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-10th-earl-of-argyle-become-duke>When did the 10th Earl of Argyle become Duke?</h2>
<p>The 10th Earl was very much in favour and was granted the Dukedom in 1701, together with a string of titles. Before that, however, he had raised a regiment know as the Earl of Argyle’s Regiment of Foot, the unit tasked with the notorious Massacre of Glencoe, an episode inaccurately classed as an act of clan vengeance by the Campbells.</p>
