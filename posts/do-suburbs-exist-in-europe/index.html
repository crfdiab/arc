<h2 id=do-suburbs-exist-in-europe>Do suburbs exist in Europe?</h2>
<p>In Europe most of the middle and upper class live in the cities and close in suburbs, leaving the lower class in the far out suburbs, exurbs, and outskirts of metropolitan areas. This is also true in Brazil, Australia, and much of the world. Some European suburbs are nice, and some even resemble American suburbs.</p>
<h2 id=do-other-countries-have-suburbs>Do other countries have suburbs?</h2>
<p>In most English-speaking countries, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, suburb has become largely synonymous with what is called a “neighborhood” in other countries, and the term encompasses inner city areas.</p>
<h2 id=do-most-europeans-live-in-cities-suburbs-or-rural-areas>Do most Europeans live in cities suburbs or rural areas?</h2>
<p>According to the harmonised de nition by Eurostat and the OECD, urban areas — de ned as cities, towns and suburbs — provide a home to 72% of the EU-28’s population; 41% live cities and 31% in towns and suburbs. Over the past 50 years, the urban population has continued to grow.</p>
<h2 id=are-european-cities-compact>Are European cities compact?</h2>
<p>There’s no visible difference. Because European cities are so much older, buildings are smaller and closer together. Everything is more compact, everything is within walking distance of each other.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-suburbs-in-england>Are there suburbs in England?</h2>
<p>Around 80% of England’s population are suburb dwellers. Many people visualise garden cities or ‘Tudorbethan’ semi-detached houses of the 1930s when they think of suburbs, but Historic England’s new research has been targeted at understanding a greater range of suburban types.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-american-neighborhoods-in-other-countries>Are there American neighborhoods in other countries?</h2>
<p>Americans aren’t particularly concentrated in many countries/cities. Most instances where you’ll find Americans, you’ll find other foreigners (e.g. “expat neighborhoods”).</p>
<h2 id=where-do-most-europeans-live>Where do most Europeans live?</h2>
<p>There is one country where most Europeans would rather live—and one they’d all rather avoid</p>
<table><tr><th>These people…</th><th>…think life is better in…</th><th>…and best in…</th></tr><tr><td>Spaniards</td><td>Germany, Sweden, UK, France</td><td>Switzerland</td></tr><tr><td>Swedes</td><td>Germany</td><td>Switzerland</td></tr><tr><td>Swiss</td><td>Sweden</td><td>Sweden</td></tr><tr><td>Brits</td><td>Sweden, Germany, France</td><td>Switzerland</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=where-is-the-largest-urban-area-in-europe>Where is the largest urban area in Europe?</h2>
<p>Paris<br>
Urban areas over 500,000 inhabitants (2015–2020)</p>

<h2 id=which-us-city-is-most-european>Which US city is most European?</h2>
<p>The Most European Cities in America</p>
<ul>
<li>Dreaming of Paris?</li>
<li>Leavenworth, Washington is One of the Most European Cities in America.</li>
<li>Boston Is a Must-See of the Most European Cities in North America.</li>
<li>Venice May Look Like Venice.</li>
<li>St.</li>
<li>Vail, Colorado is the Alpine Village of Your Dreams.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-are-american-cities-boring>Why are American cities Boring?</h2>
<p>American cities can seem boring by comparison to Europe. The reason is they were built much more recently. Settlers moved into these areas within the last 200–300 years and literally decided “hey, this spot looks nice.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-live-in-suburbia-in-europe>How many people live in suburbia in Europe?</h2>
<p>Although cities everywhere have developed in each of these ways at various times, nowhere in Europe do urban settlements sprawl as much as in the United States. Less than a quarter of the U.S. population lived in suburbia in 1930. Now well over half does.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-australian-and-european-cities-compare-for-population>How are Australian and European cities compare for population?</h2>
<p>To make comparisons, I’ve taken the square kilometre population grid data for Europe and Australia, and summed the population and number of cells within the urban area/centre boundaries (as discussed in last post) that have at least 100 residents (ie 1 person per hectare or more) for each city.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-chinatowns-in-major-cities-in-europe>Are there Chinatowns in major cities in Europe?</h2>
<p>Chinatowns in Europe include several urban Chinatowns that exist in major European capital cities. There is a Chinatown in London, England, as well as major Chinatowns in Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle and Liverpool.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-city-in-europe-by-population>Which is the largest city in Europe by population?</h2>
<p>Moscow is the capital of the country of Russia and it is also the largest city in existence within the entire European continent. It is the home of 12.2 million people and serves as the center of culture in Europe. The city is near the Moskva River.</p>
