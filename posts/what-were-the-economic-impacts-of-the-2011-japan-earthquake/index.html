<p>The economic destruction of the “Triple Disaster” was massive: 138,000 buildings were destroyed and $360 billion in economic losses were incurred. This was the most expensive disaster in human history. Japanese response to the earthquake and tsunami was rapid, effective and life-saving.</p>

<p>The earthquake that struck the Japanese port city of Kobe in the early morning of January 17, 1995, was the most severe quake ever to strike a modern urban area.

<p>The effects of the Great Hanshin earthquake were also seen on the Japanese economy with several industries being forced to shut down, transport (including the trade of goods from the port of Kobe) coming to a standstill, several commercial complexes being razed to dust,….. and so on.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-worst-earthquake-in-japan-in-1995>Where was the worst earthquake in Japan in 1995?</h2>
<p>The Great Hanshin Earthquake Disaster of 1995 was one of the worst in Japan’s history, killing 6,433 people and causing more than $100 billion in damages. On January 17, 1995, a major earthquake struck near the city of Kobe, Japan, killing more than 6,000 and making more than 45,000 people homeless.</p>
