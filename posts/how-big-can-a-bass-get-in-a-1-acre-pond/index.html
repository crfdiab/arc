<h2 id=how-big-can-a-bass-get-in-a-1-acre-pond>How big can a bass get in a 1 acre pond?</h2>
<p>50-100 bass<br>
In a balanced bass pond stocked with prey fish such as bluegill and fathead minnows as well as some channel cats if you like, a one acre pond can generally support 50-100 bass. For natural ponds in areas with low soil fertility, that number might be on the lower end.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-pounds-of-bass-do-you-need-per-acre>How many pounds of bass do you need per acre?</h2>
<p>In ponds and small lakes, harvesting bass is not only encouraged, it is usually required to have fast bass growth rates and larger maximum sizes. Most southern states recommend harvesting anywhere from 15 to 35 pounds of bass per acre per year, depending on the specific pond situation.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-can-a-largemouth-bass-get-in-a-pond>How big can a largemouth bass get in a pond?</h2>
<p>A half acre pond, for example, probably won’t grow more than 25 pounds of largemouth bass, naturally. Since bass are top line predators, focus on forage fish production, if you want bass.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-would-a-10-lb-largemouth-bass-be>How old would a 10 lb largemouth bass be?</h2>
<p>In a Florida study, 822 trophy bass (10 pounds and up) given to taxidermists showed a mean age of 9.7 years. That’s a growth rate of about a pound a year.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-fish-to-stock-a-pond-with>What is the best fish to stock a pond with?</h2>
<p>What Fish Should You Stock In Your Farm Pond?</p>
<ul>
<li>Green sunfish.</li>
<li>Trout.</li>
<li>Carp (common and grass)</li>
<li>Goldfish.</li>
<li>Yellow perch.</li>
<li>Buffalofish.</li>
<li>Tilapia.</li>
<li>Crappies (black and white)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=will-crappie-take-over-a-pond>Will crappie take over a pond?</h2>
<p>White crappie has an extremely high reproductive capacity and can over populate in a body of water that is not large enough to support their numbers. While there is nothing wrong with the white crappie, they are not used in pond stocking or raised commercially.</p>
<h2 id=what-size-bass-should-you-keep>What size bass should you keep?</h2>
<p>What size bass should you eat? The best size largemouth bass to eat is about 10-14 inches, and ideally no bigger than 15 inches. Similar to many other fish species, younger bass have more tender meat and better flavor, while the older ones get tougher, and tend to accumulate more toxins over the years.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-bass-should-be-in-a-2-acre-pond>How many bass should be in a 2 acre pond?</h2>
<p>Too few bass will not be able to control other fish populations; too many bass will deplete the pond of its resources. If adult bass are needed, stocking them at a rate of 5-10 bass per acre will help maintain a pond’s food chain and result in a healthy, thriving pond.</p>
<h2 id=how-deep-should-my-bass-pond-be>How deep should my bass pond be?</h2>
<p>3 to 4 feet<br>
Ideally, a bass pond should have a minimum depth of at least 3 to 4 feet. Bass don’t spend much time in water shallower than that. Use soil left over from excavating shallower areas to form ridges in deeper parts of the pond.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-heaviest-bass-ever-caught>What is the heaviest bass ever caught?</h2>
<p>22 pounds, 4 ounces<br>
Official Largemouth World Record: George Perry’s Undefeated Bass. On June 2nd, 1932, George Perry caught the current world record bass out of Lake Montgomery, an oxbow lake off the Ocmulgee River in southern Georgia. The fish (the whopper) weighed 22 pounds, 4 ounces.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-a-5-pound-largemouth-bass>How old is a 5 pound largemouth bass?</h2>
<p>A 15-inch bass might be an average four-year-old, a fast growing three-year-old or a slow growing five-year-old. A typical northern-strain five-pounder might be anywhere between six and 16 years old, McHugh reports.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-a-7-lb-largemouth-bass>How old is a 7 lb largemouth bass?</h2>
<p>We have seen bass that were 7 pounds at age two and 14 pounds at age 6 ½. Three to four pounds in one year is max. 5.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-does-a-largemouth-bass-get-in-a-year>How big does a largemouth bass get in a year?</h2>
<p>As with most fish, the growth rate of largemouth bass is highly variable and depends on food supply and environmental conditions. Largemouth can grow to more than 2 pounds their first year under ideal conditions, but in nature about 0.5 pound is normal. Females are normally larger than males.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-grow-bigger-bass-in-a-pond>Is it possible to grow bigger bass in a pond?</h2>
<p>When you learn about the important principles of pond management and then enhance those principles by adding a supplemental fish feeding program, you can grow bigger bass in a pond or lake. You also understand that growing big bass is not rocket science but good stewardship of your pond or lake environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-scales-of-a-florida-largemouth-bass>What are the scales of a Florida largemouth bass?</h2>
<p>The Florida largemouth has slightly smaller scales than the northern largemouth bass in relation to the size of its body. It has 69 to 73 scales along the lateral line, compared to 59 to 65 on the northern largemouth.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-largemouth-bass-found-in-the-united-states>Where are largemouth bass found in the United States?</h2>
<p>The largemouth bass is now found in most suitable habitat across the United States, including ponds, lakes, reservoirs, and rivers from Washington state to Florida and Maine to California. The largemouth bass is one of the most widely distributed fish in the world.</p>
