<p>Spanish empire<br>
Philip II was a member of the Habsburg dynasty. He served as king of the Spaniards from 1556 to 1598 and as king of the Portuguese (as Philip I) from 1580 to 1598. The Spanish empire under Philip prospered: it attained its greatest power, extent, and influence.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-did-philip-ii-rule>What countries did Philip II rule?</h2>
<p>Philip II (Spanish: Felipe II; 21 May 1527 – 13 September 1598) also known as “Philip the Prudent” (Spanish: Felipe el Prudente) was King of Spain (1556–1598), King of Portugal (1580–1598, as Philip I, Portuguese: Filipe I), King of Naples and Sicily (both from 1554), and jure uxoris King of England and Ireland (during …</p>
<h2 id=did-philip-ii-expand-the-power-of-spain>Did Philip II expand the power of Spain?</h2>
<p>Why did Charles V divide the Hapsburg Empire? During his 42-year reign, Philip II expanded Spanish influence, strengthened the Catholic Church, and made his own power absolute. Thanks in part to silver from Spanish colonies in the Americas, he made Spain the foremost power in Europe.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-king-philip-ii-of-spain-have-dominions>Where did King Philip II of Spain have dominions?</h2>
<p>Philip’s dominions extended from the Spanish heartlands to the Netherlands and Burgundy, while his dominions in Italy included Milan, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia. His extra-European sphere of power grew through the enormous expansion of the colonial territories in the Americas and Asia.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-government-did-king-phillip-ii-have>What kind of government did King Phillip II have?</h2>
<p>Philip had a small group of advisors to help him but the Council of State made the nobles believe that they held the power. They had a quorum to vent their arguments against one another but better verbally than militarily. But the nobles as a whole had no real power. The various kingdoms were run by professional graduates.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-philip-ii-of-spain-an-absolute-monarch>Why is Philip II of Spain an absolute monarch?</h2>
<p>Philip II, as head of the government of Spain, believed in the divine right of monarchs and used this to justify a number of immoral and illegal acts, such as ordering murders. Philip developed a system of regional self-government with viceroys answering to him and he ruled as an absolute monarch.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-philippines-the-fifth-largest-country-in-the-world>Why is the Philippines the fifth largest country in the world?</h2>
<p>The Philippines’ location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the country prone to earthquakes and typhoons, but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world’s greatest biodiversity. The Philippines is the world’s fifth-largest island country with an area of 300,000 km 2 (120,000 sq mi).</p>
