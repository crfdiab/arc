<h2 id=why-does-the-earth-have-mountains-and-valleys>Why does the Earth have mountains and valleys?</h2>
<p>Tectonic plate movement under the Earth can create landforms by pushing up mountains and hills. Erosion by water and wind can wear down land and create landforms like valleys and canyons.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-valley-in-between-mountains>Is a valley in between mountains?</h2>
<p>A valley is an elongated low area often running between hills or mountains, which will typically contain a river or stream running from one end to the other. Rift valleys arise principally from earth movements, rather than erosion.</p>
<h2 id=does-earth-have-valley>Does earth Have valley?</h2>
<p>Valleys are one of the most common landforms on the Earth and they are formed through erosion or the gradual wearing down of the land by wind and water. In river valleys​, for example, the river acts as an erosional agent by grinding down the rock or soil and creating a valley.</p>
<h2 id=are-valleys-bigger-than-mountains>Are valleys bigger than mountains?</h2>
<p>is that mountain is a large mass of earth and rock, rising above the common level of the earth or adjacent land, usually given by geographers as above 1000 feet in height (or 3048 metres), though such masses may still be described as hills in comparison with larger mountains while valley is an elongated depression …</p>

<h2 id=what-does-the-bible-say-about-valleys>What does the Bible say about valleys?</h2>
<p>“Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.” (Psalm 23:4 NIV).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-gap-between-two-mountains-called>What is the gap between two mountains called?</h2>
<p>In geomorphology, a col is the lowest point on a mountain ridge between two peaks. It may also be called a gap. Cols lie on the line of the watershed between two mountains, often on a prominent ridge or arête.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-deepest-valley-in-the-world>Which is the deepest valley in the world?</h2>
<p>Arun valley<br>
located between Sagarmatha and Makalu-Barun National Park, Arun valley, “Deepest valley in world” situated 435m from above sea level. Because of it has situated status, Arun valley known as deepest valley trekking destination in a world.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-valleys-different-from-mountains-and-valleys>How are valleys different from mountains and valleys?</h2>
<p>Mountains and Valleys. A valley is a low area of land between hills or mountains, typically with a river or stream flowing through it. Valleys are one of the most common landforms on the surface of the planet. There are three main types of valleys, the V-shaped valley, the flat floored valley and the U-shaped valley.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-valleys-most-likely-to-be-found>Where are valleys most likely to be found?</h2>
<p>Valleys are most commonly drained by rivers and may occur in a relatively flat plain or between ranges of hills or mountains. Those valleys produced by tectonic action are called rift valleys.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-valleys-colder-than-areas-that-are-higher-up>Why are valleys colder than areas that are higher up?</h2>
<p>But if you got somewhere which is high up and the air can cool down on the tops of mountains, it’s then denser around it and it falls downwards and if it’s not falling very far it doesn’t compress very much, doesn’t get very much hotter so you get, locally very cold air is in bottoms of valleys but globally it’s warmer low down and colder higher.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-valleys-in-the-north-pole>Why are there valleys in the North Pole?</h2>
<p>Some river and stream valleys, especially those in the mountains or located near the North and South Poles, are transformed by glaciers. The massive blocks of snow and ice slowly creep downhill where they will meet the least resistance: valleys already cut by rivers and streams.</p>
