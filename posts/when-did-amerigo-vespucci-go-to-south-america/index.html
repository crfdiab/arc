<h2 id=when-did-amerigo-vespucci-go-to-south-america>When did Amerigo Vespucci go to South America?</h2>
<p>Amerigo discovered the northern part of South America in 1499. He even went deeper into the great river of Amazon. Later, in his third voyage to the western world in 1502, Amerigo set foot in the Bahamas. So, according to the dates of the two voyages, Columbus was the first man in the Colonial period who discovered America.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-education-did-amerigo-vespucci-have>What kind of Education did Amerigo Vespucci have?</h2>
<p>Vespucci was the son of Nastagio, a notary. As a boy Vespucci was given a humanistic education by his uncle Giorgio Antonio. In 1479 he accompanied another relation, sent by the famous Italian family of Medici to be their spokesman to the king of France.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-amerigo-vespucci-become-manager-of-sevilla-agency>When did Amerigo Vespucci become manager of Sevilla agency?</h2>
<p>When Berardi died, either at the end of 1495 or at the beginning of 1496, Vespucci became manager of the Sevilla agency. Did you know? Thefirst use of the name “America” was in 1507, when a new world map was created based on the explorations of Amerigo Vespucci. The period during which Vespucci made his voyages falls between 1497 and 1504.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-amerigo-vespucci-write-his-first-letter>Where did Amerigo Vespucci write his first letter?</h2>
<p>Two series of documents on his voyages are extant. The first series consists of a letter in the name of Vespucci dated from Lisbon, Portugal, September 4, 1504, written in Italian, perhaps to the gonfalonier (magistrate of a medieval Italian republic) Piero Soderini, and printed in Florence in 1505;</p>

<h2 id=where-did-vespuccis-ships-dock-in-1502>Where did Vespucci’s ships dock in 1502?</h2>
<p>The ships may have journeyed still farther south, along the coast of Patagonia (in present-day southern Argentina). The return route is unknown. Vespucci’s ships anchored at Lisbon on July 22, 1502.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-vespucci-think-of-the-land-he-was-exploring>What did Vespucci think of the land he was exploring?</h2>
<p>Vespucci realized the land he was exploring was a separate continent and not part of Asia, as he and many others believed at the time.</p>

<h2 id=where-did-amerigo-vespucci-find-the-garden-of-eden>Where did Amerigo Vespucci find the Garden of Eden?</h2>
<p>The expedition explored much of the northeastern coast of South America, including stops in Trinidad and Guyana. They also visited a tranquil bay and named it “Venezuela,” or “Little Venice.” The name stuck. Like Columbus, Vespucci suspected that he may have been looking at the long-lost Garden of Eden, the Earthly Paradise.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-picture-of-vespucci-on-the-map>Which is the picture of Vespucci on the map?</h2>
<p>On the upper part of the map, with the hemisphere comprising the Old World, appears the picture of Ptolemy; on the part of the map with the New World hemisphere is the picture of Vespucci.</p>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-obstacles-did-amerigo-vespucci-face>What kind of obstacles did Amerigo Vespucci face?</h2>
<p>What obstacles did Amerigo Vespucci face? On this journey Amerigo and his crew had some obstacles such as poor maps and navigational tools and inadequate supplies. Most explorers had this problem as well.</p>
<p>Amerigo Vespucci. The Vespucci family was well-connected, and Amerigo received an excellent education by his uncle Giorgio Antonio. He became fluent in several languages, and had much interest in cartography, astronomy, and navigation techniques.
