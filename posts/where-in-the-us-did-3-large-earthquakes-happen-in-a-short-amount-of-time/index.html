<h2 id=where-in-the-us-did-3-large-earthquakes-happen-in-a-short-amount-of-time>Where in the US did 3 large earthquakes happen in a short amount of time?</h2>
<p>New Madrid earthquakes of 1811–12, series of three large earthquakes that occurred near New Madrid, Missouri, between December 1811 and February 1812.</p>
<h2 id=what-city-was-the-first-reported-earthquake-to-have-its-epicenter-in-maryland-occur>What city was the first reported earthquake to have its epicenter in Maryland occur?</h2>
<p>Annapolis<br>
The first reported earthquake to have actually had its epicenter in Maryland occurred south of Annapolis on April 25, 1758, but no record of its strength is known to exist. The shock lasted 30 seconds and was preceded by subterranean noises.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-the-mississippi-river-flow-backwards-in-1812>How long did the Mississippi River flow backwards in 1812?</h2>
<p>24 hours<br>
The storm surge ahead of Hurricane Isaac made the Mississippi River run backwards for 24 hours.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-earthquake-in-charleston-sc-in-1886-such-a-surprise>Why was the earthquake in Charleston SC In 1886 such a surprise?</h2>
<p>It is believed to have occurred on faults formed during the break-up of Pangaea. Similar faults are found all along the east coast of North America. It is thought that such ancient faults remain active from forces exerted on them by present-day motions of the North American Plate.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-36-earthquake-bad>Is a 3.6 earthquake bad?</h2>
<p>Earthquakes that fall between 3.0 to 3.9 on the scale are considered minor. We can feel the earthquake, and objects inside are going to shake around, but there very rarely is damage.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-mississippi-river-run-backwards>Why did the Mississippi river run backwards?</h2>
<p>On February 7, 1812, the most violent of a series of earthquakes near Missouri causes a so-called fluvial tsunami in the Mississippi River, actually making the river run backward for several hours. The earthquake also caused fissures—some as much as several hundred feet long–to open on the earth’s surface.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-new-madrid-earthquake>What would happen if New Madrid earthquake?</h2>
<p>Over 15,000 people would be killed. An additional 120,000 would be displaced. Nearly 200 schools and over 100 fire stations would be damaged; 37 hospitals and 67 police stations would be inoperable the day after the earthquake in the state of Missouri.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-worst-hurricane-in-south-carolina>What was the worst hurricane in South Carolina?</h2>
<p>Hurricane Hugo<br>
Hurricane Hugo, September 1989 Considered by many to be the worst hurricane in modern South Carolina history. The storm leveled parts of the Charleston area, as well as the southern Grand Strand, before cutting through the center of South Carolina, smacking the Columbia and Sumter areas, and blasting Charlotte.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-earthquake-in-venezuela-in-1812>Where was the earthquake in Venezuela in 1812?</h2>
<p>The 1812 Caracas earthquake took place in Venezuela on March 26 (on Maundy Thursday) at 4:37 p.m. It measured 7.7 on the Richter magnitude scale. It caused extensive damage in Caracas, La Guaira, Barquisimeto, San Felipe, and Mérida. An estimated 15,000–20,000 people perished as a result, in addition to incalculable material damage.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-san-juan-capistrano-earthquake-in-1812>Where was the San Juan Capistrano earthquake in 1812?</h2>
<p>The 1812 San Juan Capistrano earthquake, also known as the Wrightwood earthquake, occurred on December 8 at 15:00 UTC in Alta California. At the time, this was a colonial territory of the Spanish Empire.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-damage-of-the-1812-wrightwood-earthquake>What was the damage of the 1812 Wrightwood earthquake?</h2>

The bell structure at Mission San Gabriel Arcángel collapsed and at Mission San Juan Capistrano the Great Stone Church was destroyed and forty Native Americans were killed as the earthquake happened during the first service.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-earthquake-in-arkansas-in-1812>Where was the earthquake in Arkansas in 1812?</h2>
<p>The first principal earthquake, M7.5, occurred at about 2:15 am (local time) in northeast Arkansas on December 16, 1811. The second principal shock, M7.3, occurred in Missouri on January 23, 1812, and the third, M7.5, on February 7, 1812, along the Reelfoot fault in Missouri and Tennessee.</p>
