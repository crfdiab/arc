<h2 id=how-phosphorus-is-recycled-locally-in-most-ecosystems>How phosphorus is recycled locally in most ecosystems?</h2>
<p>55.4: Describe the phosphorus cycle and explain how phosphorus is recylcled locally in most ecosystems. Over time, rain and weathering cause rocks to release phosphate ions and other minerals. When the plant or animal dies, it decays, and the organic phosphate is returned to the soil.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-these-ecosystems-accounts-for-the-largest-amount-in--of-primary-productivity-on-earth>Which of these ecosystems accounts for the largest amount in %) of primary productivity on Earth?</h2>
<p>How is it that the open ocean produces the highest net primary productivity of Earth’s ecosystems, yet net primary productivity per square meter is relatively low? Oceans contain greater concentrations of nutrients compared to other ecosystems. Oceans receive a greater amount of solar energy per unit area.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-is-primarily-responsible-for-limiting-the-number-of-trophic-levels-in-most-ecosystem>Which of the following is primarily responsible for limiting the number of trophic levels in most ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Which of the following is primarily responsible for limiting the number of trophic levels in most ecosystems? Decomposers compete with higher-order consumers for nutrients and energy. Nutrient cycles involve both abiotic and biotic components of ecosystems.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-first-step-in-the-restoration-of-an-extremely-degraded-ecosystem>What is the first step in the restoration of an extremely degraded ecosystem?</h2>
<p>What is the first step in ecosystem restoration? to restore the physical structure.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-nutrients-recycled-in-ecosystems>How are nutrients recycled in ecosystems?</h2>
<p>Decomposing bacteria and fungi break down dead organisms. They help recycle minerals and nutrients to the environment, which can then be used by other organisms. As they decompose dead matter, the decomposers also respire and so release carbon dioxide to the environment, contributing to the carbon cycle .</p>
<h2 id=which-nutrient-is-most-often-limiting-for-plants>Which nutrient is most often limiting for plants?</h2>
<p>Nitrogen and phosphorus are among the elements considered most limiting to plant growth and productivity because they are often present in small quantities locally or are present in a form that cannot be used by the plant.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-energy-and-matter-used-in-ecosystems>How is energy and matter used in ecosystems?</h2>
<p>In ecosystems, matter and energy are transferred from one form to another. Decomposers break down dead plant and animal matter. Producers (plants) use sunlight and other nutrients to make their own food through photosynthesis. Consumers are the animals that consume, or eat, other living things.</p>
<h2 id=can-ecosystems-be-restored>Can ecosystems be restored?</h2>
<p>Ecological restoration is human facilitation of the repair of a damaged or destroyed ecosystem. Restored environments may take years to function without human intervention and may never be the same as their intact predecessors, but restoration remains an important part of the conservation toolbox.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-phosphorus-get-into-surface-water-bodies>How does phosphorus get into surface water bodies?</h2>
<p>Phosphorus in surface and groundwater. Phosphorus gets into water in both urban and agricultural settings. Phosphorus tends to attach to soil particles and, thus, moves into surface-water bodies from runoff.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-phosphorus-normally-enter-the-nitrogen-cycle>How does phosphorus normally enter the nitrogen cycle?</h2>
<p>In the nitrogen cycle, the organisms that replenish the atmosphere with N2 are… How does phosphorus normally enter ecosystems? Why do logged tropical rain forest soils typically have nutrient-poor soils?</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-phosphorous-in-tropical-bedrock>What happens to the phosphorous in tropical bedrock?</h2>
<p>A) Tropical bedrock contains little phosphorous. B) Logging results in soil temperatures that are lethal to nitrogen-fixing bacteria. C) Most of the nutrients in the ecosystem are removed in the harvested timber. D) The cation exchange capacity of the soil is reversed as a result of logging.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-majority-of-phosphorus-in-the-united-states-come-from>Where does the majority of phosphorus in the United States come from?</h2>
<p>The first chart below shows the amount of phosphorus, in tons per year, upstream and downstream of the Chattahoochee River at Atlanta, which is a major source of the local water supply.</p>
