<h2 id=what-did-the-spaniards-bring-to-mexico>What did the Spaniards bring to Mexico?</h2>
<p>In short term, the Spaniard introduced many things. For example, they brought advanced technologies, new faith, and non-native diseases, flora, and fauna. The Spaniard conqueror enslaved natives, and took almost all the silver and gold from the Mexican gold mine.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-spanish-looking-for-in-mexico>What were the Spanish looking for in Mexico?</h2>
<p>The Spanish conquistadors were looking for lands to conquer, gold, silver, slaves and people to preach the Catholic religion. The Spanish conquistador, Hernan Cortes came to Mexico and met the ruler of the Aztec Empire. The Aztecs believed that the Spanish Conquistador was a god.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-spanish-seeking-when-they-invaded-mexico>What were the Spanish seeking when they invaded Mexico?</h2>
<p>The conquest of Mexico began with an expedition to search for gold on the American mainland. In 1519 Cortés led about 450 men to Mexico and made his way from Veracruz on the Gulf Coast to the island city of Tenochtitlan, the stunningly beautiful Aztec capital situated in Lake Texcoco.</p>
<h2 id=who-invaded-mexico-in-1862>Who invaded Mexico in 1862?</h2>
<p>Emperor Napoleon III<br>
In 1862, French Emperor Napoleon III maneuvered to establish a French client state in Mexico, and eventually installed Maximilian of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-story-of-the-spanish-conquest-of-mexico>What was the story of the Spanish conquest of Mexico?</h2>
<p>So far, Spain has rejected that request. The story of the Spanish conquest, as it has been commonly understood for 500 years, goes like this: Montezuma surrendered his empire to Cortés. Cortés and his men entered Tenochtitlán and lived there peacefully for months until rebellious Aztecs attacked them.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-spanish-immigrants-come-to-mexico>When did the Spanish immigrants come to Mexico?</h2>
<p>Spanish Mexicans are citizens or residents of Mexico who identify as Spanish as a result of nationality or ancestry. Spanish immigration to Mexico began in the early 1500s and spans to the present day.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-did-the-spanish-capture-in-mexico>How many people did the Spanish capture in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Although the Spanish forces numbered some 500 men, they managed to capture Aztec Emperor Montezuma II. The city later revolted, forcing Cortés and his men to retreat. Five-hundred years ago, two men met and changed much of the world forever.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-in-mexico-are-of-spanish-ancestry>How many people in Mexico are of Spanish ancestry?</h2>
<p>The vast majority of Mexicans have at least partial Spanish ancestry and Mexicans of full or predominant Spanish ancestry make up close to half of the population.</p>
