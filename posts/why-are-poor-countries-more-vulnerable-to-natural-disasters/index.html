<h2 id=why-are-poor-countries-more-vulnerable-to-natural-disasters>Why are poor countries more vulnerable to natural disasters?</h2>
<p>Developing countries are more vulnerable to natural disasters because people live in areas at high risk from natural disasters (e.g., unsafe urban areas), the housing is poorly built and can be easily damaged in the event of a disaster, countries are not equipped with early warning systems, and they have few assets and …</p>
<h2 id=how-do-disasters-affect-the-poor>How do disasters affect the poor?</h2>
<p>The impact of disasters on the poor can, in addition to loss of life, injury and damage, cause a total loss of livelihoods, displacement, poor health, food insecurity, among other consequences.</p>

<h2 id=are-there-any-natural-disasters-worse-than-earthquakes>Are there any natural disasters worse than earthquakes?</h2>
<p>But earthquakes are not the only natural catastrophe to factor in: monsoons, tsunamis, and floods are all prevalent in the region. An important aspect in understanding the threat posed to Tokyo is how these events would reverberate on the world scale.</p>
