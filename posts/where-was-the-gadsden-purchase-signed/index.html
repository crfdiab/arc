<p>Mexico City<br>
The Gadsden Purchase Was Signed in Mexico City. Meeting in Mexico City on December 30, 1853, James Gadsden, U.S. Minister to Mexico, and General Antonio López de Santa Anna, president of Mexico, signed the Gadsden Purchase.</p>
<h2 id=was-mexico-ever-a-part-of-the-united-states>Was Mexico ever a part of the United States?</h2>
<p>Area Mexico ceded to the United States in 1848, minus Texan claims. The Mexican Cession consisted of present-day U.S. states of California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona, the western half of New Mexico, the western quarter of Colorado, and the southwest corner of Wyoming.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-when-the-us-bought-arizona>Who was president when the US bought Arizona?</h2>
<p>In 1853, President Franklin Pierce sent James Gadsden to Mexico City to negotiate with Santa Anna, and the United States bought the remaining southern strip area of Arizona and New Mexico in the Gadsden Purchase . Before 1846 the Apache raiders expelled most Mexican ranchers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-acquire-land-from-mexico>How did the US acquire land from Mexico?</h2>
<p>The Gadsden Purchase, or Treaty, was an agreement between the United States and Mexico, finalized in 1854, in which the United States agreed to pay Mexico $10 million for a 29,670 square mile portion of Mexico that later became part of Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-arizona-become-part-of-the-united-states>When did Arizona become part of the United States?</h2>
<p>By means of the Gadsden Purchase, the United States secured the northern part of the state of Sonora, which is now Arizona south of the Gila River in 1854. In 1863, Arizona was split off from the Territory of New Mexico to form the Arizona Territory.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-united-states-acquire-the-southwestern-united-states>When did the United States acquire the southwestern United States?</h2>
<p>Much of area had been a part of New Spain and Mexico until the United States acquired the area through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 and the smaller Gadsden Purchase in 1854. While the region’s boundaries are not officially defined, there have been attempts to do so.</p>
