<h2 id=how-much-did-the-americans-help-in-ww1>How much did the Americans help in ww1?</h2>
<p>During the war the U.S. mobilized over 4 million military personnel and suffered the loss of 65,000 men.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-us-soldiers-were-involved-in-ww1>How many US soldiers were involved in ww1?</h2>
<p>four million men<br>
On April 6, 1917, when the United States declared war against Germany, the nation had a standing army of 127,500 officers and soldiers. By the end of the war, four million men had served in the United States Army, with an additional 800,000 in other military service branches.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-us-help-a-lot-in-ww1>Did the US help a lot in ww1?</h2>
<p>U.S. military power helped to bring the war to an end—a prospect at which the German government scoffed in 1917. But the U.S. Army was, by European standards, pitiful—not quite 140,000 men. With astonishing speed, the War Department began creating a new army from scratch to take on the Germans.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-civilians-did-the-us-kill-in-ww1>How many civilians did the US kill in ww1?</h2>
<p>“These figures are approximate only, the records being incomplete.” The U.S. War Department in 1924 estimated 13,716 killed and died. Civilian deaths exceeded the prewar level by 92,000. 62,000 were caused by food shortages and German reprisals, and 30,000 by the Spanish Flu.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-americans-were-killed-in-world-war-1>How many Americans were killed in World War 1?</h2>
<p>Worldwide, an estimated 40 million people were killed or wounded, including more than 300,000 American service members. Far from the front lines, American citizens came together to support the war effort and the troops fighting “over there.”</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-united-states-use-in-world-war-1>What did the United States use in World War 1?</h2>
<p>The United States sent more than a million troops to Europe, where they encountered a war unlike any other—one waged in trenches and in the air, and one marked by the rise of such military technologies as the tank, the field telephone, and poison gas.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-members-of-the-us-army-were-in-world-war-1>How many members of the US Army were in World War 1?</h2>
<p>It was only the fourth time Congress had declared war; the others were the War of 1812, the War with Mexico in 1846 and the Spanish-American War of 1898. In early 1917, the U.S. Army had just 133,000 members.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-children-do-in-world-war-1>What did children do in World War 1?</h2>
<p>Children were enlisted to sell war bonds and plant victory gardens in support of the war effort. The United States sent more than a million troops to Europe, where they encountered a war unlike any other—one waged in trenches and in the air, and one marked by the rise of such military technologies as the tank, the field telephone, and poison gas.</p>
