<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-the-moon>How long does it take to get to the Moon?</h2>
<p>Historically, most lunar missions have taken about three days to reach the moon, assuming the moon is at an ideal distance of 240,000 miles (386,243 kilometers) away. This means astronauts travel roughly 3,333 mph (5,364 kph) on their journey to the moon.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-days-does-a-spaceship-takes-to-reach-the-mars>How many days does a spaceship takes to reach the Mars?</h2>
<p>The trip to Mars will take about seven months and about 300 million miles (480 million kilometers). During that journey, engineers have several opportunities to adjust the spacecraft’s flight path, to make sure its speed and direction are best for arrival at Jezero Crater on Mars.</p>

<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-go-to-the-moon-2020>How much does it cost to go to the Moon 2020?</h2>
<p>Some of the space tourism start-up companies have declared their cost for each tourist for a tour to the Moon. Circumlunar flyby: Space Adventures is charging $150 million per seat, a price that includes months of ground-based training, although this is only a fly-by mission, and will not land on the Moon.</p>
<h2 id=do-we-age-differently-in-space>Do we age differently in space?</h2>
<p>Spaceflight influences biology in dramatic ways, and people in space appear to experience the effects of aging faster than people on Earth. The health effects associated with spaceflight have several similarities to aging-related disorders, such as cancer and osteoporosis.</p>
<h2 id=is-going-to-mars-a-one-way-trip>Is going to Mars a one way trip?</h2>
<p>A ‘one way’ trip (or, in other words: emigration) to Mars is currently the only way we can get people on Mars within the next 20 years. This in no way excludes the possibility of a return flight at some point in the future.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-first-person-to-walk-on-the-moon>Who is the first person to walk on the Moon?</h2>
<p>Neil Armstrong<br>
Collins stayed in orbit around the moon. He did experiments and took pictures. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first human to step on the moon. He and Aldrin walked around for three hours.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-pay-to-go-in-space>Can you pay to go in space?</h2>
<p>On the day that billionaire Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos goes to space it’s worth knowing that a ticket to reach space can cost as much as $55 million for a “proper” orbital flight and a visit to the International Space Station (ISS)—and as little as nothing at all.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-a-spacecraft-to-travel-to-the-moon>How long does it take for a spacecraft to travel to the Moon?</h2>
<p>It takes about 3 days for a spacecraft to reach the Moon. During that time a spacecraft travels at least 240,000 miles (386,400 kilometers) which is the distance between Earth and the Moon. The specific distance depends on the specific path chosen. Continue the conversation on</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-luna-1-to-land-on-the-moon>How long did it take Luna 1 to land on the Moon?</h2>
<p>So it totally depends on the speed of the spacecraft that in how many days or hours it will land on the Moon. Luna 1 first investigation was launched by the USSR and it took near about 34 hours to reach within the 6000 kilometers on the Moon.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-new-horizons-to-reach-the-moon>How long did it take New Horizons to reach the Moon?</h2>
<p>It reached on the moon after 3 days, 3 hours, 49 minutes in space. On the other hand, the NASA’s one of the fastest spacecraft New Horizons Pluto mission took about eight hours and 35 minutes to reach its destination. It is the shortest time taken by any spacecraft to reach the moon.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-apollo-8-to-get-to-the-moon>How long did it take Apollo 8 to get to the Moon?</h2>
<p>This spacecraft reached the moon after a year. NASA sent eight missions on the moon among these six of landed successfully and two were crashed. Apollo 8 took 69 hours 8 minutes to reach to the moon. Other manned missions such as Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the moon.</p>
