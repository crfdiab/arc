<h2 id=why-was-the-spanish-exploration-important>Why was the Spanish exploration important?</h2>
<p>The motives for Spanish exploration was to find Northwest Passage, which they believed was a direct and efficient route to the Orient – home of spices, silks and wealth. The Spanish explorers were in search of mineral wealth, looking for El Dorado (the City of Gold) and they aspired to spread Christianity.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-spain-involved-in-the-history-of-texas>How was Spain involved in the history of Texas?</h2>
<p>The Spanish Colonial era in Texas began with a system of missions and presidios, designed to spread Christianity and to establish control over the region. The missions were managed by friars from the order of St. The missionaries hoped to spread Christianity and the Spanish culture to native groups.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-spanish-begin-to-explore-texas>When did the Spanish begin to explore Texas?</h2>
<p>Spanish exploration did not continue until the rumor of riches lured many explorers to Texas. These explorations increased Spanish knowledge of Texan geography and native people. Juan de Grivalja first explored Texas at Galveston Island in 1518.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-spain-stop-sending-explorers-to-new-mexico>Why did Spain stop sending explorers to New Mexico?</h2>
<p>Spain stopped sending these types of expeditions due to the New Laws of 1543, a human rights document aimed at limiting Spanish abuses inflicted on Native Americans. For the remainder of the 16th century, Spanish colonization progressed slowly northward with the final settlement by Juan de Oñate in New Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-spanish-take-control-of-texas>Why did the Spanish take control of Texas?</h2>
<p>Following the Louisiana Purchase, Spain began to reinforce Texas in order to protect its Mexican colony from its new neighbor, the United States. The Mexican War of Independence, which began in 1810, weakened Spanish control in Texas, which saw major battles fought between royalists and insurgents.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-spanish-discover-during-the-age-of-exploration>What did the Spanish discover during the age of exploration?</h2>
<p>As Spanish conquistadors filtered into lands occupied by the Indians, gold was discovered, which started a huge period of adventure and exploration. During the Age of Exploration, many brave men swept across the Ocean, some discussed in this article.</p>
