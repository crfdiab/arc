<h2 id=is-pagoda-chinese-or-japanese>Is Pagoda Chinese or Japanese?</h2>
<p>A pagoda is a tiered tower with multiple eaves common to Nepal, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and other parts of Asia. Most pagodas were built to have a religious function, most often Buddhist but sometimes Taoist, and were often located in or near viharas. The pagoda traces its origins to the stupa of ancient India.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-japanese-not-like-china>Why did the Japanese not like China?</h2>
<p>Most reasons for anti-Japanese sentiment in China can be directly traced to the Second Sino-Japanese War, which was one theatre of World War II. As a consequence of the war, China suffered 7 million to 16 million civilian deaths and 3 million military casualties.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-japanese-meet-the-chinese>When did the Japanese meet the Chinese?</h2>
<p>ON JULY 7, 1937 a clash occurred between Chinese and Japanese troops near Peiping in North China. When this clash was followed by indications of intensified military activity on the part of Japan, Secretary of State Hull urged upon the Japanese Government a policy of self-restraint.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-under-ground-land-in-chinese-mythology>What was the under ground land in Chinese mythology?</h2>
<p>Below was a vast under ground land, also known as Diyu, Yellow Springs, Hell, and other terms. As time progressed, the idea of an underground land in which the souls of the departed were punished for their misdeeds during life became explicit, related to developments in Daoism and Buddhism.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-chinese-influence-the-japanese-writing-system>How did the Chinese influence the Japanese writing system?</h2>
<p>It is believed that the Japanese writing system came under influence by the Chinese through its written language. In the beginning, writing in Japan was primarily done by immigrant clerks who wrote in Chinese. One individual in particular known as Wani helped introduce the Chinese characters into Japan.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-chinese-mythology-say-about-the-middle-east>What did Chinese mythology say about the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Generally, Chinese mythology regarded people as living in the middle regions of the world and conceived the exotic earthly places to exist in the directional extremes to the north, east, south, or west. Eventually, the idea of an eastern and western paradise seems to have arisen. In the west according to certain myths there was Kunlun.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-ruler-of-japan-when-the-chinese-fled>Who was the ruler of Japan when the Chinese fled?</h2>
<p>After fleeing Japan, Mugaku Sogen became an advisor to the then ruler of Japan, Hōjō Tokimune. The Chinese refugees who fled the Mongols warned the Japanese that the Mongols would also intend to invade Japan.</p>
