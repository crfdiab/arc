<h2 id=is-maryland-west-or-south>Is Maryland west or south?</h2>
<p>Md. listen) MERR-ə-lənd) is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. Baltimore is the largest city in the state and the capital is Annapolis.</p>
<h2 id=is-maryland-on-the-south-side>Is Maryland on the South Side?</h2>
<p>As defined by the United States Census Bureau, the Southern region of the United States includes sixteen states. The South Atlantic States: Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. The East South Central States: Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee.</p>
<h2 id=is-maryland-part-of-the-south-or-northeast>Is Maryland part of the South or Northeast?</h2>
<p>As Maryland is located North of Washington, D.C., it is a northern state. The south begins with Virginia, located south of Washington, D.C. Maryland is technically below the Mason Dixon line but the people in Maryland do not consider themselves part of the south.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-maryland-located-in-the-united-states>Where is Maryland located in the United States?</h2>
<p>Located in the Atlantic Region of the United States, Maryland is situated between four states along with the District of Columbia. Maryland is south of Pennsylvania. To the east of Maryland lies Delaware.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-state-of-maryland-a-southern-or-a-northern-state>Is the state of Maryland a southern or a Northern State?</h2>
<p>For many of us from the Deep South – Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana – Maryland is absolutely a northern state. Even Arkansas, Tennessee, and Georgia are seen as part of the South, but not the Deep South.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-northern-half-of-maryland-located>Where was the northern half of Maryland located?</h2>
<p>Midland – Northern half of state near the Pennsylvania border (ie, along the Mason-Dixon line). Settled largely by people of German descent who had farms without slaves. Very few plantations with black slaves were found compared to the southern part of the state.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-maryland-a-southern-state-before-the-civil-war>Why was Maryland a southern state before the Civil War?</h2>
<p>Maryland is south of the line, in “Dixie” and is considered a southern state. Maryland was a slave state before the Civil War but stayed with the union, in part because the federal government arrested Maryland state delegates who were prepared to vote for succession. However, the sentiments in the state were divided.</p>
