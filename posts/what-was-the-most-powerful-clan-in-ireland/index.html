<p>The O’Briens<br>
O’Brien: The O’Briens were one of the most powerful clans in Ireland. The majority of them originated in Munster, particularly county Clare. The name was made famous by Brian Boru, who was King of Munster and later became the High King of Ireland, the richest and most respected person in the country.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-sept-in-ireland>What is a sept in Ireland?</h2>
<p>A sept is a division of a family, especially of a Scottish or Irish family.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-the-leader-of-an-irish-clan>What do you call the leader of an Irish clan?</h2>
<p>The larger or more important clans were led by a Taoiseach or Chief who had the status of royalty and the smaller and more dependent clans were led by Chieftains.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-tribes-of-ireland>What are the tribes of Ireland?</h2>
<p>The fourteen tribes included the following families: Athy, Blake, Bodkin, Browne, D’Arcy, Deane, Font, Ffrench, Joyce (One of whom was Richard Joyce – Creator of the Claddagh Ring), Kirwan, Lynch, Martin, Morris and Skerritt.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-sept-part-of-a-clan>Is a Sept part of a clan?</h2>
<p>A sept is a large and powerful family within a clan. Individual members of a Sept may not share the same surname as the clan Chief but were nonetheless a powerful part of the group and in fact, heads of these Septs could sometimes be as powerful as the Chief himself.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-word-clan-come-from-in-irish>Where does the word clan come from in Irish?</h2>
<p>The word clan is derived from ‘clann’ meaning ‘family’ in the Irish and Scottish Gaelic languages. The word was taken into English about 1425 as a label for the tribal nature of Irish and Scottish Gaelic society.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-clan-system-start-in-ireland>When did the clan system start in Ireland?</h2>
<p>The clan system formed the basis of society up to the 17th century. Scholars sometimes disagree about whether it is better to use the terms “sept” or “clan” when referring to traditional Irish family groups. Historically, the term ‘sept’ was not used in Ireland until the nineteenth century, long after any notion of clanship had been eradicated.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-names-of-a-clan-formed>How are the names of a clan formed?</h2>
<p>Some, however, and probably the very oldest, appear to be plural names, like the names of the Celtic tribes of Gaul in Caesar’s time; while others are formed by prefixing certain words to place-names. Of words prefixed to the names of ancestors to form clan-names, we have the following:</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-name-clann-dalaigh-come-from>Where did the name Clann Dalaigh come from?</h2>
<p>Map of Ireland AD 900, with major kingdoms and principal Viking towns. The Irish word clann is a borrowing from the Latin planta, meaning a plant, an offshoot, offspring, a single child or children, by extension race or descendants. For instance, the O’Daly family were poetically known as Clann Dalaigh, from a remote ancestor called Dalach.</p>
