<p>four to six weeks<br>
After digging themselves out of the ground, cicadas climb up nearby trees and shed their skin one last time. Once they emerge from hibernating underground, cicadas live from four to six weeks.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-will-cicadas-be-in-georgia>How long will cicadas be in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Georgia hosts only one brood of 13-year cicadas. However, three broods of 17-year cicadas have been identified in the Peach State. They will make their appearance in 2017, 2021 and 2028, respectively.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-cicadas-hibernate-for-17-years>Why do cicadas hibernate for 17 years?</h2>
<p>It’s how they progress from their nymphal stage to their final adult stage.” Underground cicadas hide from predators and they remain until the soil temperature tells them it’s time to come out. They emerge wearing a protective outer shell that they shed once they’re hiding again inside the foliage of nearby trees.</p>
<h2 id=what-month-do-cicadas-come-out-in-georgia>What month do cicadas come out in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Parts of the South will also see the return of Brood X beginning in late April and early May. In Georgia, the brood is expected to emerge in only a handful of northern counties including Union, White and Gilmer counties, according to the website Cicada Mania.</p>
<h2 id=are-the-cicadas-in-georgia-yet>Are the cicadas in Georgia yet?</h2>
<p>Brood X Cicadas emerge in North Georgia Periodical Cicadas are characterized by their black bodies, bright red eyes, and orange wings. According to Dr. Nancy Hinkle, Professor of Entomology from the University of Georgia, those numbers just don’t exist in our state of Georgia.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-cicadas-to-die>What causes cicadas to die?</h2>
<p>Massospora cicadina is a fungal pathogen that infects only 13- and 17-year periodical cicadas, such as this year’s Brood X. The disease takes over their bodies, causing many to lose their lower abdomen and genitals.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-locust-and-a-cicada>What’s the difference between a locust and a cicada?</h2>
<p>They are different species of insects. Locusts belong to the same family of insects as grasshoppers. Cicadas don’t cause the same level of destruction as locusts. Although large swarms of cicadas can damage young trees as they lay their eggs in branches, larger trees can usually withstand the cicadas.</p>
<h2 id=what-month-do-cicadas-come-out-2021>What month do cicadas come out 2021?</h2>
<p>2021 cicadas: 13 facts about the Brood X cicada invasion, maps, when they will emerge. Billions of Brood X cicadas that look like this will be emerging from the ground in 15 U.S. states in May and June of 2021, and making a lot of noise.</p>
<h2 id=what-states-will-cicadas-be-in-2021>What states will cicadas be in 2021?</h2>
<p>This year, a group of cicadas known as Brood X is expected to appear in the District of Columbia and at least parts of these 15 states: Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-a-cicada-live-in-the-ground>How long does a cicada live in the ground?</h2>
<p>For example, a 17-year-old cicada lives underground for 17 years, so as to swarm and mate above the ground for a few weeks. Others are simply called ‘annuals’, because the adults appear every year, particularly ‘the dog day cicada’. Immature periodical cicadas or nymphs develop underground, sucking root plant juices.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-cicadas-invaded-georgia>When was the last time cicadas invaded Georgia?</h2>
<p>17 Years Ago, Georgia Was Invaded…. And It’s About To Happen Again. It’s been 17 years since that familiar drone of the cicada has been heard in Georgia. But it’s about to come back in full force. What’s known as the Brood VI Cicada (more commonly the 17-year cicada) has been lurking under Georgia soil since the year 2000.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-brood-vi-cicada-come-back-to-georgia>When does brood VI cicada come back to Georgia?</h2>
<p>But it’s about to come back in full force. What’s known as the Brood VI Cicada (more commonly the 17-year cicada) has been lurking under Georgia soil since the year 2000. And in a few short months, once the temperature again becomes warm enough, they will emerge in millions to various parts of the southeast.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-cicada-species-are-there-in-the-world>How many cicada species are there in the world?</h2>
<p>There exist some 3,000 cicada species, but only a part of them shares this behavior. For example, a 17-year-old cicada lives underground for 17 years, so as to swarm and mate above the ground for a few weeks. Others are simply called ‘annuals’, because the adults appear every year, particularly ‘the dog day cicada’.</p>
