<p>Peter Carl Fabergé<br>
Fabergé egg/Inventors</p>
<p>One-hundred thirty-six years ago, Tsar Alexander III of Russia commissioned Peter Carl Fabergé to create a jeweled egg as an Easter gift for his wife, Empress Maria Feodorovna. It was meant to be a one-time order, but the result was so pleasing that the tsar immediately placed an order for the following year.</p>
<h2 id=who-owns-the-fabergé-eggs-today>Who owns the Fabergé eggs today?</h2>
<p>The eggs now belong to Queen Elizabeth II, who also owns multiple other Fabergé collectables including ornaments, boxes and photo frames. Several years ago, a €20 million Fabergé egg wound up sitting unidentified at an antiques market in the United States. Like several others, the egg had been lost for years.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-last-faberge-egg-made>What was the last Faberge egg made?</h2>
<p>Constellation egg<br>
The Constellation egg is one of two Easter eggs designed under the supervision of Peter Carl Fabergé in 1917, for the last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II as an Easter gift to his wife, the Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna . It was the last Imperial Fabergé egg designed. It remains unfinished.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-know-if-my-faberge-egg-is-real>How do I know if my Faberge egg is real?</h2>
<p>Symbols. Probably the most tell-tale sign of a copy of a Faberge egg is the focus of the piece. Symbols that weren’t around during Faberge’s lifetime in Russia, for example, an American flag. Are one of the most accurate ways to tell an original Faberge egg from a Faberge egg replica.</p>
<h2 id=are-faberge-eggs-marked>Are Faberge eggs marked?</h2>
<p>Fabergé flowers are not always marked and can vary greatly in terms of style.</p>

<h2 id=where-did-the-first-faberge-egg-come-from>Where did the first Faberge egg come from?</h2>
<p>The first Fabergé egg was ordered from a St. Petersburg jeweller Karl Gustavovich Fabergé in 1885 by Emperor Alexander III as an Easter gift for his wife Maria Feodorovna. That was the beginning of the Fabergé history. The Emperor met the jeweller at an exhibition in Moscow. He highly appreciated the items made at the Fabergé workshop.</p>

<p>Fabergé was also commissioned to make twelve eggs for the industrialist Alexander Kelch, though only seven appear to have been completed.</p>

<p>In 1900, Fabergé’s work represented Russia at the 1900 World’s Fair in Paris. As Carl Fabergé was a member of the jury, the House of Fabergé exhibited hors concours (without competing).</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-founder-of-the-house-of-faberge>Who was the founder of the House of Faberge?</h2>
<p>The House of Fabergé (French pronunciation: ​[fabɛʁʒe]; Russian: Дом Фаберже) is a jewellery firm founded in 1842 in Saint Petersburg, Russia, by Gustav Faberge, using the accented name Fabergé. Gustav’s sons, Peter Carl and Agathon, and grandsons followed him in running the business until it was nationalised by the Bolsheviks in 1918.</p>
