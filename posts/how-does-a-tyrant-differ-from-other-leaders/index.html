<h2 id=how-does-a-tyrant-differ-from-other-leaders>How does a tyrant differ from other leaders?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, a leader is someone we want to follow, whereas a tyrant is someone we feel coerced to follow—If not by direct physical force, then by the powerfully manipulative force of fear.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-government-that-existed-in-sparta-could-be-described-as>What type of government that existed in Sparta could be described as?</h2>
<p>Sparta remained a military oligarchy while other citystates shifted to tyrannies and democracies. A military oligarchy is a government in which the military exercises control over the people.</p>
<h2 id=was-ancient-greece-was-dependent-on-trade-in-large-part-because-only-a-small-part-of-its-land-was-usable-for-farming>Was ancient Greece was dependent on trade in large part because only a small part of its land was usable for farming?</h2>
<p>Ancient Greece was dependent on trade in large part because only a small part of its land was usable for farming. False: The various regions of Greece were separated by MOUNTAIN.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-tyrannical-leader>What makes a tyrannical leader?</h2>
<p>These leaders micro-manage, express rage when things go wrong, and use blame and shame for motivation. A tyrant has an unhealthy relationship to power and control. A new form of leadership is being called for that creates trust, which leads to creativity and innovation.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-pericles-die>How did Pericles die?</h2>
<p>Plague<br>
Pericles/Cause of death<br>
The cause of the plague of Athens in 430BC, which devastated the city and killed up to one-third of the population, including its leader, Pericles, was typhoid fever, scientists believe.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-a-tyranny-in-ancient-greece>Who was the leader of a tyranny in ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>A tyrant was the leader of a tyranny, just as a monarch ruled the monarchy. Since they weren’t elected (as democratic rulers were) and didn’t fall within traditions of hereditary succession (as monarchical rulers did), tyrants often had to find creative ways to justify their power.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-definition-of-a-tyrant-in-ancient-greece>What was the definition of a tyrant in ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>Definition. A tyrant in ancient Greece meant something different from our modern concept of a tyrant as simply a cruel and oppressive despot. A tyrant was little more than an autocrat or leader who had overturned an existing regime of a Greek polis and was, therefore, an illegitimate ruler, a usurper.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-first-tyrant-come-to-power>How did the first tyrant come to power?</h2>
<p>In his article, “The First Tyrants in Greece,” Robert Drews paraphrases Aristotle as saying that the tyrant was a degenerate type of monarch who came to power because of how insufferable the aristocracy was. The people of the demos, fed up, found a tyrant to champion them.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-type-of-government-in-ancient-greece>What was the type of government in ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>In ancient Greece, a tyrant differed from other leaders in that he d. had authority over the military. 3. The type of government that existed in Sparta could be described as a. a monarchy. Solon is known for b. writing a legal code for Athens that included debt slavery. A phalanx was a type of b. military formation.</p>
