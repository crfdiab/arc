<h2 id=how-did-the-french-lose-louisiana>How did the French lose Louisiana?</h2>
<p>In 1762, following the brutal French and Indian War, the government of France negotiated the Treaty of Fontainebleau with their counterparts in Spain. The treaty effectively ceded the territory of Louisiana and the island of Orleans—essentially what is now New Orleans—to the Spaniards.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-french-lose-the-french-and-indian-war>Why did the French lose the French and Indian war?</h2>
<p>France was more interested in the fur trade than in settling the land. The British hurt the French traders’ business when they bought fur from the Indians. However, by 1760 the French had lost Quebec and Montreal to the British. The French and Indian War ended after the British defeated the French in Quebec.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-french-empire-fall>How did the French empire fall?</h2>
<p>Collapse of the empire The French colonial empire began to fall apart during the Second World War, when various parts of their empire were occupied by foreign powers (Japan in Indochina, Britain in Syria and Lebanon, the US and Britain in Morocco and Algeria, Germany in Tunisia).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-won-the-french-and-indian-war>Why did the British won the French and Indian war?</h2>
<p>Reasons for Britain’s Victory Collaboration with colonial authorities: Pitt gave local authorities control over supplies and recruitment, paying them for their help, while the French struggled to get manpower and supplies. The French were however better at recruiting the Indians to fight with them. A better navy.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-france-try-to-settle-in-florida>When did France try to settle in Florida?</h2>
<p>After the many attempts to settle Florida by the Spanish, it was beginning to seem like a hopeless goal. Almost as on cue after Tristan de Luna’s failure in 1559, France had three ships en route to Florida by February 1562. Although France never owned Florida, she did have some effect on south Florida and the Keys.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-france-help-in-the-american-revolution>How did France help in the American Revolution?</h2>
<p>The plan’s success hinged on French naval support. Washington and Rochambeau had requested and received the assistance of the French fleet in the West Indies commanded by Admiral François Joseph Paul de Grasse, who was sailing to Virginia.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-france-do-to-the-florida-keys>What did France do to the Florida Keys?</h2>
<p>Although France never owned Florida, she did have some effect on south Florida and the Keys. Some of the escaped Huguenots were captured in the vicinity of the Keys. A concurrent event in time is that William Shakespeare was born two years later on April 23, 1564.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spanish-defeat-the-french-at-staugustine>How did the Spanish defeat the French at St.Augustine?</h2>
<p>Not prepared to do battle, French Admiral Ribault immediately got under sail, but a storm wrecked his fleet at sea. Spanish Menendez then chose not to attack, sailed south to St. Augustine, then marched back over land to capture the French Fort Caroline completely by surprise.</p>
