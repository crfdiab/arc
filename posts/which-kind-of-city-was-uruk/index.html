<h2 id=which-kind-of-city-was-uruk>Which kind of city was Uruk?</h2>
<p>Uruk was the first major city in Sumer built in the 5th century BC, and is considered one of the largest Sumerian settlements and most important religious centers in Mesopotamia. It was continuously inhabited from about 5000 BC up to the 5th century AD.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-found-at-uruk>What was found at Uruk?</h2>
<p>By around 3200 B.C., the largest settlement in southern Mesopotamia, if not the world, was Uruk: a true city dominated by monumental mud-brick buildings decorated with mosaics of painted clay cones embedded in the walls, and extraordinary works of art.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-underwater-cities-in-the-world>Are there any underwater cities in the world?</h2>
<p>Beneath the waters of Lake Qiandao in China, there are ruins of cities and towns that used to be part of two regions called Chun’an and Sui’an. The towns were submerged in 1957, when the government at that time decided to build a hydroelectric power station in the area, according to National Geographic.</p>

<p>Temples and stone statues, a lot of shipwrecks, assorted evidence of a city that was once above ground, these underwater remnants are what can be seen and what remained from an ancient Egyptian port. The sunken city of Thonis-Heracleion in Egypt was the official port of the country a long time ago.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-city-that-is-completely-submerged-in-water>Is there a city that is completely submerged in water?</h2>
<p>A lot has changed since then, though. During the late eighties and early nineties the town slowly sank, or the waters of the nearby EpecuénLake, or Lago Epecuén, slowly rose. The town was completely submerged in water before the end of the millennium.</p>
