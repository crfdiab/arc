<h2 id=why-did-australia-went-to-war>Why did Australia went to war?</h2>
<p>When Great Britain declared war on Germany in 1914, Australia found itself automatically at war too. Most Australians believed that they were a part of the British Empire and wanted to do all they could to protect it. It was popularly believed that participation in the war would also ‘prove’ Australia as a new nation.</p>
<h2 id=has-australia-started-a-war>Has Australia started a war?</h2>
<p>Australia’s history is different from that of many other nations in that since the first coming of the Europeans and their dispossession of the Aboriginals, Australia has not experienced a subsequent invasion; no war has since been fought on Australian soil. Yet Australians have fought in ten wars.</p>

<p>The south-west of Western Australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850. The war in Queensland began in the area around Brisbane in the 1840s and continued until 1860, moving to central Queensland in the 1850s and 1860s, and then to northern Queensland from the 1860s to 1900.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-world-war-1-affect-the-history-of-australia>How did World War 1 affect the history of Australia?</h2>
<p>The world war marked a decisive moment in the history of Australia, remember to this day for the ANZAC story of the Army’s sacrifices at Gallipoli, and the coming-of-age of a young nation. The declaration of war by King George V in August 1914 automatically involved all of Britain’s colonies and dominions.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-military-history-does-australia-have>What kind of military history does Australia have?</h2>
<p>Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations, Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars, and war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity, including the Anzac spirit.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-prime-minister-of-australia-during-world-war-1>Who was Prime Minister of Australia during World War 1?</h2>
<p>C550 Australia’s involvement in the First World War began when Britain and Germany went to war on 4 August 1914, and both Prime Minister Joseph Cook and Opposition Leader Andrew Fisher, who were in the midst of an election campaign, pledged full support for Britain.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-war-and-australian-society>What was the relationship between war and Australian society?</h2>
<p>The relationship between war and Australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture: bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare.</p>
