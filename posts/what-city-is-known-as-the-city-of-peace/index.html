<h2 id=what-city-is-known-as-the-city-of-peace>What city is known as the city of peace?</h2>
<p>While today Baghdad is predominantly associated with war, tragedy, and grief, the Baghdad of the eighth and ninth centuries, also known as Madinat-al-Salam, or the City of Peace, was one of the most advanced cities in the world.</p>
<h2 id=which-city-is-known-as-peace-city-in-japan>Which city is known as peace city in Japan?</h2>
<p>Hiroshima was proclaimed a City of Peace by the Japanese parliament in 1949, at the initiative of its mayor, Shinzo Hamai (1905–1968). As a result, the city of Hiroshima received more international attention as a desirable location for holding international conferences on peace as well as social issues.</p>
<h2 id=are-city-names-translated>Are city names translated?</h2>
<p>Most cities whose names are translated are those who were present in mediæval or renaissance maps, which were written in Latin. As a rule of thumb, cities “founded or found” later than that don’t have their names translated.</p>
<h2 id=which-african-citys-name-means-place-of-peace>Which African city’s name means place of peace?</h2>
<p>From great African jazz clubs to the biggest shopping centre in Limpopo, Polokwane has an entertaining mix of city adventures, and plenty of game reserves and natural attractions right on its doorstep. The name Polokwane means “place of peace” in Sepedi or northern Sotho.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-city-of-peace-in-the-bible>What is the city of peace in the Bible?</h2>
<p>The fact is that Jerusalem – unique among the cities of Israel – is completely identified with our Jewish national mission, expressing by its very name “City of Peace” our prophetic vision for the world. Jeru means “city” in ancient Semitic languages and Shalem means “peace” (wholeness).</p>
<h2 id=do-names-of-places-change-in-french>Do names of places change in French?</h2>

<h2 id=where-did-the-name-jerusalem-come-from>Where did the name Jerusalem come from?</h2>
<p>It is believed by some scholars that the name of Jerusalem comes from Uru + Shalem, meaning the foundation of Shalem or founded by Shalem or city of Shalem, and that Shalem was the city god of the place before El Elyon.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-word-peace-come-from-in-the-bible>Where does the word peace come from in the Bible?</h2>
<p>In English, the word “peace” conjures up a passive picture, one showing an absence of civil disturbance or hostilities, or a personality free from internal and external strife. The biblical concept of peace is larger than that and rests heavily on the Hebrew root slm, which means “to be complete” or “to be sound.”</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-capital-city-of-the-world-at-peace>Which is the capital city of the world at peace?</h2>
<p>Before Jerusalem finally fulfils its appointed destiny as the city of the Prince of peace, and capital city of a world at peace, it has had to experience a long period of being trodden down (trampled, NKJV) by the Gentiles (Luke 21:24).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-jerusalem-called-the-city-of-peace>Why is Jerusalem called the city of peace?</h2>
