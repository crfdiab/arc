<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-of-rapid-growth-of-population>What are the causes of rapid growth of population?</h2>
<p>The Causes of Overpopulation</p>
<ul>

<li>Underutilized Contraception.</li>
<li>Lack of Female Education.</li>
<li>Ecological Degradation.</li>
<li>Increased Conflicts.</li>
<li>Higher Risk of Disasters and Pandemics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=is-the-main-cause-of-growth-of-population>Is the main cause of growth of population?</h2>

<h2 id=what-are-solutions-to-overpopulation>What are solutions to overpopulation?</h2>

</ul>
<h2 id=whats-the-current-population-growth-rate-in-ghana>What’s the current population growth rate in Ghana?</h2>
<p>Ghana is currently growing at a rate of 2.15% per year, which has slowly decreased from 2.95% in 1985 but still remains high. The main cause of this growth is Ghana’s high fertility rate of 3.89 births per woman and the country’s efforts to minimize birth mortalities.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-population-growth-related-to-economic-development>How is population growth related to economic development?</h2>
<p>Population growth is usually related to economic development. There occurs a typical fall in death rates and birth rates due to improved living conditions leading to low population growth, a phenomenon called demographic transition. It is associated with urbanisation and growth and occurs in four phases:</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-ghana-in-the-10th-century>What was the population of Ghana in the 10th century?</h2>
