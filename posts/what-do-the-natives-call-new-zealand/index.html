<p>Māori<br>
Māori are the tangata whenua, the indigenous people, of New Zealand. They came here more than 1000 years ago from their mythical Polynesian homeland of Hawaiki. Today, one in seven New Zealanders identify as Māori.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-māori-first-come-to-nz>When did Māori first come to NZ?</h2>
<p>listen)) are the indigenous Polynesian people of mainland New Zealand. Māori originated with settlers from eastern Polynesia, who arrived in New Zealand in several waves of waka (canoe) voyages between roughly 1320 and 1350.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-hawaiki-so-important>Why is Hawaiki so important?</h2>
<p>Hawaiki is the traditional Māori place of origin. And in Māori mythology Hawaiki is the place where Io, the supreme being, created the world and its first people. It is the place from which each person comes, and it is where each will return after death.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-maori-come-to-new-zealand>When did the Maori come to New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Māori are the indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand, they settled here over 700 years ago. They came from Polynesia by waka (canoe). New Zealand has a shorter human history than any other country.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-maori-refer-to-themselves-as-people-of-the-land>Why do Maori refer to themselves as people of the land?</h2>
<p>Māori people often use the term tangata whenua (literally, “people of the land”) to identify in a way that expresses their relationship with a particular area of land; a tribe may be the tangata whenua in one area, but not in another. The term can also refer to the Māori people as a whole in relation to New Zealand (Aotearoa) as a whole.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-people-of-new-zealand-come-from>Where did the people of New Zealand come from?</h2>
<p>The Māori originated from settlers who migrated to New Zealand from eastern Polynesia. Polynesian people settled a large area encompassing Samoa, Tahiti, Hawaii, Easter Island (Rapa Nui) – and finally New Zealand.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-moriori-come-from-in-new-zealand>Where did the Moriori come from in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Moriori are believed to have migrated to the Chathams from the South Island of New Zealand. In the late 18th century, there were about 2000 Moriori living on the Chathams. However, disease and attacks from Māori saw the numbers of this peace-loving tribe become severely depleted.</p>
