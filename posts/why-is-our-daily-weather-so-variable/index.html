<h2 id=why-is-our-daily-weather-so-variable>Why is our daily weather so variable?</h2>
<p>Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the Sun’s angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-weather-variable>Why is weather variable?</h2>
<p>These elements, such as air temperature, wind speed and direc- tion, and precipitation, are normally called the weather variables because each element changes with time, yet are all related. Learn how wind patterns affect the weather. • Learn why humidity is one of the weather variables.</p>
<h2 id=is-weather-a-highly-variable>Is weather a highly variable?</h2>
<p>Weather can be highly variable on a daily, weekly, or even yearly basis – one day it might be sunny and the next it’s snowing. Climate, on the other hand, doesn’t change day-to-day because it is based on longer time scales and averages.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-weather-so-changeable>Why is weather so changeable?</h2>
<p>Meteorologists have the job of predicting changes in weather, but there are a lot of factors that affect weather: temperature, air pressure, cloud patterns, precipitation, and wind factors including its speed, direction, and moisture level.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-variables-of-climate>What are the 3 variables of climate?</h2>
<p>Climate entails the statistical characteristics of weather conditions in a given area. Climate zones are characterized by different combinations of climate variables, such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-5-variables-of-weather>What are the 5 variables of weather?</h2>
<p>They are temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity, precipitation, and cloudiness. Together, these components describe the weather at any given time.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-most-variable-weather-on-earth-found>Where is the most variable weather on Earth Found?</h2>
<p>Rapid City<br>
Rapid City has the crown for the most variable weather.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-english-weather-so-bad>Why is English weather so bad?</h2>
<p>Why is the weather so bad? And, like much of Welsh weather, the reason behind the unsettled weather is all because of what’s happening with the jet stream over the Atlantic. And that basically means the cold and wet weather gets “stuck” – rather than move west to east like it usually does.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-weather-in-the-british-isles-so-variable>Why is the weather in the British Isles so variable?</h2>
<p>The variability of weather and climate in different regions of the British Isles is due to the different air masses that meet over the Isles. Each air mass brings with them different characteristics, as shown in the map below.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-weather-in-the-uk-so-changeable>Why is the weather in the UK so changeable?</h2>
<p>The weather of the UK is very changeable because it is affected by a number of different air masses. Britain is under an area where five main air masses meet. An air mass is a large body of air that has similar temperature and moisture properties throughout.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-weather-different-in-different-parts-of-the-uk>Why is the weather different in different parts of the UK?</h2>
<p>Different parts of the UK experience slightly different regional climates. These can be summarised as: The variability of weather and climate in different regions of the British Isles is due to the different air masses that meet over the Isles. Each air mass brings with them different characteristics, as shown in the map below.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-weather-in-your-region-affect-your-weather>How does the weather in your region affect your weather?</h2>
<p>Weather in your region will eventually affect the weather hundreds or thousands of kilometers away. For example, a snowstorm around Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, might eventually reach Chicago, Illinois, as it moves southeast through the U.S.</p>
