<h2 id=what-building-became-the-center-of-learning-in-baghdad>What building became the center of learning in Baghdad?</h2>
<p>The founding of the House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikma) by Caliph Harun al-Rashid in 830 was an impetus for the bolstering of cultural activity. This rapid growth was paralleled by a flourishing cultural and academic enterprise that would make Baghdad the world’s most famous center of learning.</p>

<p>The House of Wisdom (Arabic: بيت الحكمة‎, romanized: Bayt al-Ḥikmah), also known as the Grand Library of Baghdad, refers to either a major Abbasid public academy and intellectual center in Baghdad or to a large private library belonging to the Abbasid Caliphs during the Islamic Golden Age.</p>

<h2 id=why-was-baghdad-considered-a-center-of-learning>Why was Baghdad considered a center of learning?</h2>
<p>Baghdad was designed in such a way that it was able to utilize the two major river systems in the area: the Tigris and the Euphrates. This strategic and geographic advantage enabled Baghdad to control trading routes and also provided its inhabitants with a plentiful supply of water.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-city-of-baghdad-get-its-name>How did the city of Baghdad get its name?</h2>
<p>T he Bab al-Sharji district in the centre of Baghdad derives its name, which means east gate, from the medieval fortifications of the city. These walls were probably built around the first half of the 10th century. During the brief British stay at the end of the first world war, its gatehouse was used as a garrison church.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-ziryab-do-for-the-city-of-cordoba>What did Ziryab do for the city of Cordoba?</h2>
<p>Ibn Hayyan of Córdoba, one of Arab Spain’s greatest historians, says in his monumental Al-Muqtabas or The Citation that Ziryab knew thousands of songs by heart and revolutionized the design of the musical instrument that became the lute.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-muslims-in-baghdad-do-for-a-living>What did the Muslims in Baghdad do for a living?</h2>
<p>In addition to libraries and bookshops, the Muslims of Baghdad established an academy devoted to research and intellectual enhancement followed by an institution which is widely acknowledged as the precursor to the modern university, and the very first hospital.</p>
