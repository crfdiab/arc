<h2 id=has-the-constitution-been-in-effect-for-231-years>Has the Constitution been in effect for 231 years?</h2>
<p>In the 231 years and two months that the U.S. Constitution has been operating, congress and the various states have updated that constitution 27 times.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-constitution-still-successful-after-231-years>Why is the Constitution still successful after 231 years?</h2>
<p>Why has the Constitution survived? The framers learned from their experiences as a colony. A single ruler was unfair and would often result in tyranny. To combat this threat, they designed the Constitution so this could never happen again.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-constitution-does-the-usa-have>What type of Constitution does the USA have?</h2>
<table><tr><th>Constitution of the United States</th></tr><tr><td>Date effective</td><td>March 4, 1789</td></tr><tr><td>System</td><td>Constitutional presidential republic</td></tr><tr><td>Branches</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Chambers</td><td>Bicameral</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-is-the-us-constitution-so-successful>Why is the US Constitution so successful?</h2>
<p>Particularly through its amendments, the Constitution guarantees every American fundamental rights and protection of life, liberty, and property. Our Constitution created an effective national government, one that balances expansive powers with specific limits.</p>
<h2 id=what-has-enabled-the-constitution-to-last-so-long>What has enabled the Constitution to last so long?</h2>
<p>The Constitution has survived for so long largely for two reasons. As a previous educator has pointed out, the Constitution has only been amended 27 times in all. This is no accident. The framers of the Constitution feared radical change and so wanted to make it as difficult as possible to make amendments.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-date-that-the-constitution-was-signed>What was the date that the constitution was signed?</h2>
<p>On September 17, 1787, the Constitution was signed. As dictated by Article VII, the document would not become binding until it was ratified by nine of the 13 states.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-usconstitution-get-ratified>How did the U.S.Constitution get ratified?</h2>
<p>U.S. Constitution signed. Supporters of the document waged a hard-won battle to win ratification by the necessary nine out of 13 U.S. states. The Articles of Confederation, ratified several months before the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781, provided for a loose confederation of U.S. states, which were sovereign in most of their affairs.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-draft-of-the-constitution-adopted>When was the first draft of the Constitution adopted?</h2>
<p>On September 25, 1789, the first Congress of the United States adopted 12 amendments to the U.S. Constitution–the Bill of Rights–and sent them to the states for ratification. Ten of these amendments were ratified in 1791.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-bill-of-rights-become-part-of-the-constitution>When did the Bill of Rights become part of the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Constitution. The Bill of Rights were 10 amendments guaranteeing basic individual protections, such as freedom of speech and religion, that became part of the Constitution in 1791. To date, there are 27 constitutional amendments.</p>
