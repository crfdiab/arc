<h2 id=is-middle-east-proper-noun>Is Middle East proper noun?</h2>
<p>Middle East (proper noun)</p>
<h2 id=is-middle-eastern-supposed-to-be-capitalized>Is Middle Eastern supposed to be capitalized?</h2>
<p>Do not hyphenate compound nationalities and ethnic or regional terms: African American, Anglo German, Middle Eastern. Geographical Names. Capitalize place names when these terms are accepted as proper nouns.</p>
<h2 id=is-middle-eastern-capitalized-ap-style>Is Middle Eastern capitalized AP style?</h2>
<p>AP Style tip: Middle East is preferred term for area including southwest Asia west of Pakistan and Afghanistan and northern Africa.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-capitalize-east-as-a-direction>Do you capitalize east as a direction?</h2>
<p>You should only capitalize directions, such as north, south, east, and west, when you are referring to the direction as a proper noun, such as “in the South” or “up North.” If you are merely referring to a direction, such as “go south on I-90,” then you should keep the direction lowercase.</p>
<h2 id=is-israel-a-part-of-the-middle-east>Is Israel a part of the Middle East?</h2>
<p>A variety of countries make up the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), including Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-hyphen-in-middle-east>Is there a hyphen in Middle East?</h2>
<p>“Middle Eastern culture.” One would normally hyphenate a compound adjective like that, but “Middle East” is a proper noun and the adjective form “Middle Eastern” is a proper adjective, so no hyphen is needed.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-are-in-near-east>What countries are in Near East?</h2>
<p>According to the National Geographic Society, the terms Near East and Middle East denote the same territories and are “generally accepted as comprising the countries of the Arabian Peninsula, Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestinian territories, Syria, and Turkey”.</p>
<h2 id=is-street-abbreviated-in-ap-style>Is Street abbreviated in AP style?</h2>
<p>Abbreviate Ave., Blvd., and St. and directional cues when used with a numbered address. Always spell out other words such as alley, drive and road. If the street name or directional cue is used without a numbered address, it should be capitalized and spelled out.</p>
<h2 id=when-to-capitalize-east-west-north-south>When to capitalize east West north south?</h2>
<p>At the most basic level, the standard advice is to lowercase north, south, east and west when used as compass directions and to capitalize them when they are used as part of a proper noun or adjective or refer to regions or geographic areas.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-capitalize-the-word-middle-eastern>When do you capitalize the word Middle Eastern?</h2>
<p>Is Middle Eastern capitalized? Do not hyphenate compound nationalities and ethnic or regional terms: African American, Anglo German, Middle Eastern. Geographical Names. Capitalize place names when these terms are accepted as proper nouns. When a name applies to a well-recognized specific place, it should be capitalized as a proper noun.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-capitalize-south-south-east-and-west>Do you capitalize south, south, east and West?</h2>
<p>So, if a person is from South Africa, south would be capitalized since it’s the proper name of the country. When you’re talking about America’s West Coast or the Middle East, the directional word is also part of a proper name, and it gets a capital letter. Sometimes, people abbreviate these names which can make it a bit more confusing.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-capitalize-the-word-east-in-a-sentence>When do you capitalize the word East in a sentence?</h2>
<p>When referring to a specific region, you should capitalize the words East Coast such as “I’m traveling to the East Coast ” since “ East Coast ” is a proper noun in this case. However, if you are referring to a general region, such as “the east coast of the United States” then you should keep the words lowercase. What does EST before a date mean?</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-rules-for-capitalization-in-english>What are the rules for capitalization in English?</h2>
<p>English Capitalization Rules: In general, you should capitalize the first word, all nouns, all verbs (even short ones, like is ), all adjectives, and all proper nouns. That means you should lowercase articles, conjunctions, and prepositions—however, some style guides say to capitalize conjunctions and prepositions that are longer than five letters.</p>
