<p>First Voyages to Canada Champlain landed in Canada in 1603, on a voyage up the St. Lawrence River with François Gravé du Pont. At the time, Champlain held no official title. He published an account of this voyage, Des Sauvages, ou, Voyage de Samuel Champlain, in France.</p>
<h2 id=what-struggles-did-samuel-de-champlain-face>What struggles did Samuel de Champlain face?</h2>
<p>Like any other explorer, Champlain faced many harsh obstacles to achieve his dream. Some were because of wars, lack of newer technology, and harsh winters. In 1609, Samuel and his crewmen befriended the Huron Indians and helped them fight the Iroquois Indians.</p>

<p>First Explorations Champlain’s earliest travels were with his uncle, and he ventured as far as Spain and the West Indies. From 1601 to 1603, he was a geographer for King Henry IV, and then joined François Gravé Du Pont’s expedition to Canada in 1603.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-samuel-de-champlain-publish-his-report>When did Samuel de Champlain publish his report?</h2>
<p>His report on the expedition was soon published in France, and in 1604 he accompanied a group of ill-fated settlers to Acadia, a region surrounding the Bay of Fundy. Champlain, Samuel de: explorations Map depicting the explorations of Samuel de Champlain in North America, early 17th century. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-samuel-de-champlain-appointed-commandant-of-new-france>Why was Samuel de Champlain appointed Commandant of New France?</h2>
<p>The fur trade had heavy financial losses in 1611, which prompted Quebec’s sponsors to abandon the colony, but Champlain persuaded Louis XIII to intervene. Eventually the king appointed a viceroy, who made Champlain commandant of New France.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-samuel-de-champlain-do-as-a-kid>What did Samuel de Champlain do as a kid?</h2>
<p>Samuel de Champlain was born on August 13, 1567 in France. He was born into a family of mariners, so from a young age he learned to navigate, draw, and read and create maps and different nautical charts; he spent a lot of time at sea when he was young. He did not learn Ancient Greek or Latin, so he did not formally learn any ancient literature.</p>

<p>In 1598, young Champlain traveled on his first voyage in his uncle in law’s ship, Saint Julien. The ship traveled to Cadiz to transport the Spanish troops. And then accompany the Spanish force to West Indies. On this voyage, Champlain was given the responsibility of the ship by his uncle.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-samuel-de-champlain-start-work-on-quebec-city>When did Samuel de Champlain start work on Quebec City?</h2>
<p>Champlain continued to work on the fortifications of what became Quebec City, laying the first stone on 6 May 1624. On 15 August he once again returned to France where he was encouraged to continue his work as well as to continue looking for a passage to China, something widely believed to exist at the time.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-samuel-de-champlain-inherit-from-his-uncle>What did Samuel de Champlain inherit from his uncle?</h2>
<p>On Champlain’s return to Cadiz in August 1600, his uncle Guillermo Elena (Guillaume Allene), who had fallen ill, asked him to look after his business affairs. This Champlain did, and when his uncle died in June 1601, Champlain inherited his substantial estate. It included an estate near La Rochelle, commercial properties in Spain]</p>
<h2 id=when-did-samuel-de-champlain-serve-in-the-french-army>When did Samuel de Champlain serve in the French army?</h2>
<p>During this time period, the French were at war against the Spanish. In 1593, Champlain served in the army of Henry of Navarre – also known as King Henry IV of France. He served in the army for 5 years, until King Henry’s and France’s victory in 1598.</p>
