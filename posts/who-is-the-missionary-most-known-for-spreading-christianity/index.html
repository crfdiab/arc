<h2 id=who-is-the-missionary-most-known-for-spreading-christianity>Who is the missionary most known for spreading Christianity?</h2>
<p>Christopher Columbus<br>
One of the main goals of the Christopher Columbus expedition financed by Queen Isabella of Spain was to spread Christianity. During the Age of Discovery, Spain and Portugal established many missions in their American and Asian colonies.</p>
<h2 id=who-spread-christianity-to-asia-minor-and-greece>Who spread Christianity to Asia Minor and Greece?</h2>
<p>Asia Minor According to the New Testament, the Apostle Paul was from Tarsus (in south-central Anatolia) and his missionary journeys were primarily in Anatolia. The Book of Revelation, believed to be authored by John of Patmos (a Greek island about 30 miles off the Anatolian coast), mentions Seven churches of Asia.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-missionaries-spread-christianity-in-africa>How did missionaries spread Christianity in Africa?</h2>
<p>Christian education in Africa Unlike that of Islam, Christian missionaries were compelled to spread an understanding of their gospel in the native language of the indigenous people they sought to convert. The bible was then translated and communicated in these native languages.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-missionary-in-christianity>What is missionary in Christianity?</h2>
<p>A Christian missionary can be defined as “one who is to witness across cultures”. Missionaries can be found in many countries around the world. In the Bible, Jesus Christ is recorded as instructing the apostles to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19–20, Mark 16:15–18).</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-christianity-to-spread>What caused Christianity to spread?</h2>
<p>Bart D. Ehrman attributes the rapid spread of Christianity to five factors: (1) the promise of salvation and eternal life for everyone was an attractive alternative to Roman religions; (2) stories of miracles and healings purportedly showed that the one Christian God was more powerful than the many Roman gods; (3) …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-turkey-called-in-the-bible>What was Turkey called in the Bible?</h2>
<p>New Testament</p>
<table><tr><th>Biblical name</th><th>Mentioned in</th><th>Country Name</th></tr><tr><td>Assos</td><td>Acts 20:13</td><td>Turkey</td></tr><tr><td>Attalia</td><td>Acts 14:25</td><td>Turkey</td></tr><tr><td>Berea</td><td>Acts 17:10-13</td><td>Greece</td></tr><tr><td>Cauda</td><td>Acts 27:16</td><td>Greece</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=who-is-priscilla-in-the-bible>Who is Priscilla in the Bible?</h2>
<p>Priscilla was a woman of Jewish heritage and one of the earliest known Christian converts who lived in Rome. Her name is a Roman diminutive for Prisca which was her formal name. She is often thought to have been the first example of a female preacher or teacher in early church history.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-church-still-involved-in-missionary-work>Is the church still involved in missionary work?</h2>
<p>Can we take this to mean that if Jesus Christ’s church is on the earth today that it should still be involved in missionary work (ie. teaching all nations, baptizing them, and teaching them to observe the commandments)? If so, which churches today are the most missionary-minded (in terms of the number of missionaries they send)?</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-missionary-minded-church-in-the-world>Which is the most missionary minded church in the world?</h2>
<p>These are ours. There is no other church that I am aware of with as many fulltime proselytizing missionaries as the Mormon Church. So using that as the metric the Mormon church would be the most missionary minded Christian church in the world. – Nelson Jan 30 ’14 at 21:13 @gerdi. Nelson has given an answer for his church.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-paul-want-to-spread-the-gospel-of-jesus>Why did Paul want to spread the Gospel of Jesus?</h2>
<p>And the matter was that the Lord decided not only to stop this bloody tyrant, but also to use his remarkable fanatic energy for the good of Divine Providence. And having obeyed God, Paul turns from a violent persecutor of Christians into a restless propagandist of the Teachings of Jesus.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jesus-teach-in-the-four-gospels>What did Jesus teach in the four Gospels?</h2>
<p>One of the clearest teachings throughout all four Gospel accounts is that the way to enter the Kingdom of God is through living in obedience to the Law of Christ. Time and time again, Jesus makes very clear statements that condemn those who think that they will be saved because they believe the right things or do the right religious rituals.</p>
