<h2 id=is-west-or-east-canada-colder>Is West or East Canada colder?</h2>
<p>The west coast is warmer than the east coast. The Canadian prairies are colder than the Great Lakes provinces of Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-east-colder-than-the-west>Why is the East colder than the West?</h2>
<p>Land has a lower heat capacity than oceans, and it also heats and cools faster than oceans. During the winter, land is much colder than the oceans. When the westerly winds blow over it, the air cools substantially. Thus, the East Coast experiences extreme cold weather during the winter.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-cold-in-eastern-canada>Is it cold in Eastern Canada?</h2>
<p>The east coast is mild and rainy in the summer, with periods of sunny weather. Winters are long, cold, and snowy in the eastern provinces. The mixing of cold and warm currents creates frequent fog near Newfoundland, particularly in the Grand Banks area. Much of the upper half of Canada has only two seasons.</p>
<h2 id=is-western-canada-cold>Is western Canada cold?</h2>
<p>These areas enjoy the mildest winter weather in all of Canada, as temperatures rarely fall much below the freezing mark. Winters in both provinces can be classified as harsh with Arctic winds and −40 °C (−40 °F) temperatures possible. Winter temperatures in both provinces average between −10 and −15 °C (14 and 5 °F).</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-western-canada-and-eastern-canada>What’s the difference between Western Canada and eastern Canada?</h2>
<p>But each side is wildly different, with imposing mountains to the west and striking icebergs to the east which begs the question, where will you focus your adventure in Canada? Read here about the best time to visit West Coast, USA. Eastern Canada refers to the provinces east of Manitoba and towards the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-europe-warmer-than-the-east-coast>Why is Europe warmer than the east coast?</h2>
<p>Warm air, cold air. It was thought that Western Europe is kept warmer than it’s latitude would suggest because of the Gulf Stream, which shoots warm equatorial waters up along the eastern coast of North America and across the North Atlantic to Europe.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-europe-warmer-than-canada-because-of-the-gulf-stream>Why is Europe warmer than Canada because of the Gulf Stream?</h2>
<p>Over the years Maury’s idea became almost axiomatic—and until recently, it also remained largely untested. In climate modeling studies where the Gulf Stream was artificially swept out of existence, the temperature differences between eastern Canada and western Europe persisted.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-colder-the-pacific-northwest-or-the-east-coast>Which is colder the Pacific Northwest or the east coast?</h2>
<p>The same phenomenon happens over the Pacific, where winters on the northeastern coast of Asia are much colder than in the Pacific Northwest. A group of researchers now think they know why this discrepancy occurs between the western and eastern ends of ocean basins — warm water off the eastern coasts of these continents affects the coastal climates.</p>
