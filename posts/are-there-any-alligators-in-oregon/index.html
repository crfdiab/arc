<h2 id=are-there-any-alligators-in-oregon>Are there any alligators in Oregon?</h2>
<p>Gators rarely turn up in the wild in Oregon, though one did pop up at Roslyn Lake in Sandy a few years ago, he said. 1 when they will be considered an exotic animal and fall under the Oregon Department of Agriculture. The alligator at Applegate River was probably sunning itself, but it did pose a danger.</p>
<h2 id=do-alligators-swim-in-rivers>Do alligators swim in rivers?</h2>
<p>Alligators are primarily freshwater animals and they do not live in the ocean. While alligators can tolerate salt water for a few hours or even days, they are primarily freshwater animals, living in swampy areas, rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-alligators-or-crocodiles-in-california-lakes>Are there alligators or crocodiles in California lakes?</h2>
<p>Alligators are not native to California. Alligators prefer fresh water but can sometimes handle brackish water and can be found in rivers, lakes and other small bodies of water.</p>
<h2 id=do-alligators-live-in-washington-state>Do alligators live in Washington State?</h2>
<p>If true, it’s an unusual sighting for the state because the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife says alligators are not native to this area. Whatever is swimming in the water has a lot of people talking.</p>
<h2 id=what-time-of-day-are-alligators-most-active>What time of day are alligators most active?</h2>
<p>Alligators are most active between dusk and dawn, so plan accordingly to reduce chances of running into them. Although many Floridians have learned to coexist with alligators, the potential for conflict always exists.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-on-the-rogue-river-in-oregon>What to do on the Rogue River in Oregon?</h2>
<p>The Rogue River is a fantastic cool treat in the middle of a hot summer day. I did a rafting trip and it was a welcome respite from the 103 degree day. The area we rafted was pretty mild (Grants Pass)… Explore the best that Southern Oregon has to offer!</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-only-dinosaur-found-in-oregon>Where was the only dinosaur found in Oregon?</h2>
<p>Near the mouth of the river, the only dinosaur fragments ever discovered in Oregon were found in the Otter Point Formation, along the coast of Curry County . People have lived along the Rogue River and its tributaries for at least 8,500 years.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-rogue-river-oregon-change-its-name>When did Rogue River Oregon change its name?</h2>
<p>The settlement was known as “Woodville” for many years, but was changed to “Rogue River” about 1912. The Woodville post office operated from 1876 until 1912, when the name was changed to Rogue River. The city of Rogue River is in western Jackson County, on the north side of the Rogue River.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-water-quality-of-the-rogue-river>What is the water quality of the Rogue River?</h2>
<p>Although sometimes too warm for salmonids, the main stem Rogue is relatively clean, ranking between 85 and 97 (on a scale of 0 to 100) on the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI). Although the Rogue Valley near Medford is partly urban, the average population density of the Rogue watershed is only about 32 people per square mile (12 per km 2 ).</p>
