<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-virginia-company-of-london>What happened to the Virginia Company of London?</h2>
<p>In 1624, the company lost its charter, and Virginia became a royal colony. A spin-off, The London Company of The Somers Isles (fully the Company of the City of London for the Plantacion of The Somers Isles, but generally referred to as The Somers Isles Company), operated until 1684.</p>

<p>In 1606, James I issued a royal charter to “adventurers” (a term that referred to both investors and settlers) in the Virginia Company of London, a joint-stock company, “to make habitation, plantation, and to deduce a colony of sundry of our people into that part of America commonly called Virginia.”</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-founder-of-the-virginia-company>Who was the founder of the Virginia Company?</h2>
<p>Virginia Company, in full Virginia Company of London, also called London Company, commercial trading company, chartered by King James I of England in April 1606 with the object of colonizing the eastern coast of North America between latitudes 34° and 41° N.</p>
