<h2 id=what-is-an-irish-cross>What is an Irish cross?</h2>
<p>The Celtic Cross’ construction features a traditional cross accentuated with a circle around the intersection of the arms and stem. Subject to many different interpretations, the Celtic Cross is said to be a representation of knowledge, strength and compassion to manage life’s ups and downs.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-celtic-crosses-in-scotland>Are there Celtic crosses in Scotland?</h2>
<p>Celtic Crosses dot hundreds of cemeteries across Ireland and Scotland, as well as Wales, England, Europe, and beyond. Few symbols are as recognizable as the Celtic Cross as the embodiment of Celtic Christianity.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-irish-high-cross>What is an Irish High Cross?</h2>
<p>A high cross or standing cross (Irish: cros ard / ardchros, Scottish Gaelic: crois àrd / àrd-chrois, Welsh: croes uchel / croes eglwysig, Armenian: Խաչքար Khachkar) is a free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often richly decorated.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-catholic-wear-a-celtic-cross>Can a Catholic wear a Celtic cross?</h2>
<p>The Celts, after they became Christian (we can especially thank St. Patrick for that, I’m guessing), extended the vertical bar, making it appear like a Christian cross – but kept the intricate knot work. Catholics still use the original Celtic Cross.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-are-high-crosses-in-ireland>How old are high crosses in Ireland?</h2>
<p>800 years old<br>
The Celtic High Cross is undoubtedly one of the best known symbols of Ireland. What distinguishes the high crosses is that they are ornamental stones and at least 800 years old. Anything younger than that is not a High Cross but just a generic Irish/Celtic cross.</p>

Does the Celtic Cross predate Christianity?</h2>
<p>Found throughout Ireland and Scotland, Celtic crosses predate Christianity and were first used by pagans in the worship of the sun. In pagan times, the Celtic cross was known as a Sun Cross or Sun Wheel and was a symbol of Odin, the Norse god. The circle in the cross is now widely known to represent the sun.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-celtic-cross-an-irish-cross>What makes a Celtic cross an Irish cross?</h2>
<p>By exact definition, an Irish Cross or Celtic Cross has to have four semi-circles cut away at the four points where the horizontal and vertical beams meet. It is also a common trait that the lower vertical section is wider at the base than at the point where it meets the centre, while the other sections are rectangular.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-bigger-a-sun-cross-or-a-celtic-cross>Which is bigger a sun cross or a Celtic cross?</h2>
