The Verendrye Monument is a granite marker about 4 feet high on which is engraved the following legend: “Here on March 30, 1743 the Verendryes buried a lead tablet to claim this region for France.

<h2 id=who-were-the-brothers-who-led-the-french-expedition>Who were the brothers who led the French expedition?</h2>
<p>Six of the seventeen who had left the settlement site with La Salle continued to Canada and, eventually, France. Among them were La Salle’s brother, Abbé Jean Cavelier, Anastase Douay, and Henri Joutel, each of whom later wrote of the expedition.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-white-man-to-see-the-rocky-mountains>Who was the first white man to see the Rocky Mountains?</h2>

<h2 id=where-did-pierre-gaultier-de-varennes-explore-before-la-verendrye>Where did Pierre Gaultier de Varennes explore before La Verendrye?</h2>
<p>In 1716 a memoir drawn up by Governor Vaudreuil showed lakes and portages as far as Lake of the Woods, from which flowed a river to the ” Sea of the West “. This implies that Frenchmen had explored west of Lake Superior before Vérendrye did so. La Vérendrye questioned the Natives who came to trade.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-louis-joseph-verendrye-start-his-expedition>When did Louis Joseph Verendrye start his expedition?</h2>

<h2 id=when-did-sieur-de-la-verendrye-return-to-new-france>When did Sieur de la Verendrye return to New France?</h2>
