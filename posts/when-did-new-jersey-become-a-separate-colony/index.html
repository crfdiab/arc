<p>Settlements were sparse and scattered, yet New Jersey’s highways were the best in the colonies due to the area’s location between New York and Philadelphia, and between the northern and southern colonies. West New Jersey served as a haven for persecuted English, Irish, Welsh, and Scottish Quakers.</p>
