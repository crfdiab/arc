<h2 id=why-did-the-first-attempts-to-settle-in-roanoke-fail>Why did the first attempts to settle in Roanoke fail?</h2>
<p>These early settlers did face many problems: they didn’t know how to farm the land; they had to share the land and resources with the native Americans; and they had to rely on Amerindian help and supplies from England. But the failure was not just down to bad luck. Other reasons have to be considered.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-both-of-the-roanoke-colonies-fail>Why did both of the Roanoke Colonies fail?</h2>
<p>The primary reason that the Roanoke colony failed was that its settlers were unprepared for the challenges that faced them in the colony due to the deceit inherent in the accounts and drawings published by Raleigh’s initial explorations of the area.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-jamestown-successful-when-both-attempts-at-roanoke-failed>Why was Jamestown successful when both attempts at Roanoke failed?</h2>
<p>Jamestown colony almost failed because the Virginia Company made a poor choice when they decided where to establish it, and they were unable to successfully work together; the colony was a success because it survived, due to tobacco and the fact that the local Native American tribes were not able to destroy it because …</p>
<h2 id=what-friendly-indians-lived-near-roanoke>What friendly Indians lived near Roanoke?</h2>
<p>Manteo<br>
Manteo was a Native American Croatan, the chief of a local tribe that befriended the English explorers who landed at Roanoke Island in 1584. In 1585 the English returned to Roanoke, arriving too late in the year to plant crops and harvest food, and Manteo helped the colonists make it through the harsh winter.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-roanoke-settlement-fail-to-succeed>Why did the Roanoke settlement fail to succeed?</h2>
<p>Why Did the Roanoke Settlement Fail? The Roanoke settlement is thought to have failed because it was poorly supplied and the colonists failed to ally with or befriend the Native peoples.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-roanoke-colony-called-the-lost-colony>Why was the Roanoke colony called The Lost Colony?</h2>
<p>The Roanoke settlement is thought to have failed because it was poorly supplied and the colonists failed to ally with or befriend the Native peoples. Roanoke is referred to as the Lost Colony because of the mysterious disappearance of the settlers and the destruction of its buildings, giving birth to myths and conspiracy stories.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-spanish-destroy-the-french-colony-in-roanoke>When did the Spanish destroy the French colony in Roanoke?</h2>
<p>The Spanish destroyed two French colonies, and there is evidence that they were looking for the Roanoke colony. The Spanish were still looking for the colony in 1600, so they can’t have destroyed it in 1590.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-amerindians-refuse-to-help-the-settlers>Why did the Amerindians refuse to help the settlers?</h2>
<p>• As food supplies began to run scarce during winter, the Amerindians started to refuse to help the settlers. They stopped giving them food and helping them fish. Some of the Amerindians, led by a Chief called Pemisapan, also attacked the settlers resulting in a number of deaths (including that of Pemisapan).</p>
