<h2 id=can-you-be-a-marine-biologist-in-alaska>Can you be a marine biologist in Alaska?</h2>
<p>The biology and marine biology degree programs at the University of Alaska are delivered by top-notch faculty actively involved in a wide range of disciplines including marine ecology, marine mammalogy, phycology, comparative physiology, neurobiology, population genetics and conservation biology.</p>
<h2 id=what-states-do-marine-biologists-work>What states do marine biologists work?</h2>

<h2 id=where-is-the-best-place-to-be-a-marine-biologist>Where is the best place to be a marine biologist?</h2>
<p>Within the US, the best organizations to get jobs in marine biology are with government agencies, so the places where those agencies (NOAA, BOEM) have offices are the best places-Washington, DC and its suburbs, New Orleans, Seattle, Anchorage, Gloucester (MA), Juneau, Honolulu, St. Petersburg, Camarillo (CA).</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-high-demand-for-marine-biologists>Is there a high demand for marine biologists?</h2>
<p>Job outlook* for marine biology careers The number of these jobs available is growing at a rate of 5-9 percent through 2026, which is considered “average” growth. The good news is that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 11,000 new jobs in research-oriented marine biology fields through 2026.</p>

<h2 id=who-hires-a-marine-biologist>Who hires a marine biologist?</h2>
<p>Marine biologists can be employed at places, such as university research laboratories, private companies, government research laboratories, and non-profit environmental advocacy organizations.</p>
<h2 id=is-marine-biology-growing-or-declining>Is marine biology growing or declining?</h2>
<p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job outlook for biologists is a growth rate of 5% from 2018 to 2028, which is as fast as the average for all positions. A marine biologist can work in many different sub-fields and sectors of marine biology depending on their skills, education and specialty.</p>
<h2 id=is-marine-biology-a-good-career-choice>Is marine Biology a good career choice?</h2>
<p>Most marine biologists do their jobs because they love the work. It is a benefit in itself, even though compared to some other jobs, they don’t make a lot of money, and the work is not always steady. You will need to be good at science and biology to complete the education necessary to become a marine biologist.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-marine-biologist-be-rich>Can a marine biologist be rich?</h2>
<p>Perhaps you have a very specific skill you can market, or even running an environmental lab of some kind. Again, here there is no limit. Most marine biologists do not make a lot of money and many, even after earning a Ph. D., end up working in other fields.</p>
<h2 id=is-marine-biology-a-good-career-choice-1>Is Marine Biology a good career choice?</h2>
<h2 id=is-marine-biology-a-good-career>Is marine biology a good career?</h2>
<h2 id=is-there-a-job-for-a-marine-biologist-in-washington>Is there a job for a marine biologist in Washington?</h2>
<p>Significantly, Washington has a very active Marine Biologist job market as there are several companies currently hiring for this type of role. With only a handful of states paying above the national average, the opportunities for economic advancement by moving to a new locationas a Marine Biologist is a decision to make with some caution.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-marine-biologists-study-in-the-sea>What do marine biologists study in the sea?</h2>
<p>Marine biologists may study anything from the largest whale down to tiny plankton, microbes, and even the seawater itself. The sea and its denizens are facing the challenges of coexisting with commercial shipping, recreational boating, plastics, chemicals, and other issues associated with human activities.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-marine-biologist-move-to-another-state>Can a marine biologist move to another state?</h2>
<p>With only a handful of states paying above the national average, the opportunities for economic advancement by moving to a new locationas a Marine Biologist is a decision to make with some caution. Factoring in cost of living expenses should be considered as well.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-nonprofit-organizations-that-need-marine-biologists>Are there any nonprofit organizations that need marine biologists?</h2>
<p>Many nonprofit organizations need marine biologists in sub-fields like microbiology, engineering, deep-sea exploration and other fields. A nonprofit organization can be a great choice if you like to work as a team to reach a common goal and create solutions to some of the world’s most extensive problems.</p>
