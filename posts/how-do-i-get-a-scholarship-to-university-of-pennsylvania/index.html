<p>Colleges may offer scholarships to recruit a talented and diverse student body. The first step is to make sure you qualify for the scholarship. If the application requirements specify that you must have a 3.7 or higher GPA, and you have a 3.6 GPA, don’t bother applying.</p>

<p>The motto of the University, Leges Sine Moribus Vanae, means “Laws without morals are useless (in vain).” It comes from the longer quotation from Horace, “Quid leges sine moribus vanae proficient” the sense of which is “of what avail are empty laws without (good) morals.”</p>

<h2 id=where-can-i-apply-for-a-university-scholarship>Where can I apply for a university scholarship?</h2>
<p>Your first port of call should be your chosen university’s official website, as they may offer their own funding opportunities for students from your location or in your subject, or possibly list external scholarships you could apply to.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-have-financial-need-to-get-full-scholarship>Do you have to have financial need to get full scholarship?</h2>
<p>Although some full scholarships will be based on financial need rather than academic excellence, some will take both into account, or only be awarded to exceptional students.</p>
