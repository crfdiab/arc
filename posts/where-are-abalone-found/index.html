<h2 id=where-are-abalone-found>Where are abalone found?</h2>
<p>Abalone are shellfish found in kelp forests in ocean waters along most continents and around the southern coast of South Africa. The large mollusks play an essential “engineering” role by grazing on plants and keeping kelp forests, which support many other species, in good condition.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-get-abalone-in-the-us>Can you get abalone in the US?</h2>
<p>In just a few decades, these once-abundant animals were nearly wiped out by overfishing, disease, and climate change. Of California’s seven abalone species, two are now federally listed as endangered in the U.S. (black and white abalone) and none are currently open to fishing.</p>
<h2 id=are-abalones-dangerous>Are abalones dangerous?</h2>
<p>Abalone divers die of exhaustion, heart attacks, or becoming entangled in kelp. Abalone is also the goal of one of the most dangerous recreational games in America. Abalone diving season kicked off in Northern California on April 1, and though no fatalities have yet been reported, well, let’s just knock on wood.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-get-abalone-on-the-east-coast>Can you get abalone on the East Coast?</h2>
<p>Abalones live all over the world, They can be seen along the waters of every continent, except the Atlantic coast of South America, the Caribbean, and the East Coast of the United States.</p>
<h2 id=is-abalone-good-for-health>Is abalone good for health?</h2>
<p>Today, research has revealed that while abalone may not necessarily be medicinal, it is indeed full of nutrients. Abalone is a good source of: Vitamin E. Vitamin B12.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-harvest-abalone>Is it illegal to harvest abalone?</h2>
<p>Sport harvesting of red abalone is permitted with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card. Transportation of abalone may only legally occur while the abalone is still attached in the shell. Sale of sport-obtained abalone is illegal, including the shell.</p>

<h2 id=why-is-it-illegal-to-fish-for-abalone>Why is it illegal to fish for abalone?</h2>
<p>It is illegal to take abalone from the ocean. Numbers of abalone are now at critically low levels because of over-exploitation. Poaching is the biggest threat to abalone. People in local communities are either paid money or given drugs by large syndicates to illegally remove abalone from the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=how-expensive-is-abalone>How expensive is abalone?</h2>
<p>The quantities fished are thus limited in comparison to demand, and the price of wild abalone can run as high as $500USD per kilo, depending on size. The fact that abalone shells are quite heavy only compounds the issue, as a kilo caught roughly translates into 250 grams of meat.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-produces-the-best-abalone>Which country produces the best abalone?</h2>
<p>China<br>
China is easily the leading producer of abalone in the world, producing nearly 115 400 tonnes in 2014,and remains the foremost consuming country.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-find-abalone-on-the-menu>Where can you find abalone on the menu?</h2>
<p>We have compiled a list of restaurants that serve the tasty sea snails. Be sure to call before you go, because while some spots feature abalone on the menu year-round, others serve them only seasonally or once a week.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-species-of-abalone-are-there-in-the-world>How many species of abalone are there in the world?</h2>
<p>Abalone are marine snails. Their taxonomy puts them in the family Haliotidae, which contains only one genus, Haliotis, which once contained six subgenera. These subgenera have become alternate representations of Haliotis. The number of species recognized worldwide ranges between 30 and 130 with over 230 species-level taxa described.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-biggest-abalone-in-california>How big is the biggest abalone in California?</h2>
<p>The largest abalone recorded in California is 12.34 in (31.3 cm), caught by John Pepper somewhere off the coast of San Mateo County in September 1993. The mollusc Concholepas concholepas is often sold in the United States under the name “Chilean abalone”, though it is not an abalone, but a muricid.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-does-an-abalone-get-before-it-reaches-maturity>How big does an abalone get before it reaches maturity?</h2>
<p>Abalones reach maturity at a relatively small size. Their fecundity is high and increases with their size, laying from 10,000 to 11 million eggs at a time. The spermatozoa are filiform and pointed at one end, and the anterior end is a rounded head. The adults provide no further assistance to the larvae and they are described as lecithotrophic.</p>
