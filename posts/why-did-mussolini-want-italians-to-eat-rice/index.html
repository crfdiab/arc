<h2 id=why-did-mussolini-want-italians-to-eat-rice>Why did Mussolini want Italians to eat rice?</h2>
<p>Marinetti, attempting to upend traditional Italian cooking, detested pasta, believing it made Italians sluggish, lethargic and lazy. He recommended they eat rice instead. Mussolini was attempting to wean his country of its foreign dependence on wheat and get them to eat the home-grown Italian produce — namely rice.</p>
<h2 id=did-mussolini-make-pasta>Did Mussolini make pasta?</h2>
<p>Mussolini did not ban pasta. Rather, he initiated the growing of durum wheat in central and northern Italy in an effort to make the country self-sufficient. Factories in the north began making pasta in the 1930s, and electric drying tunnels replaced sea and volcanic breezes.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-pasta-banned-in-italy>Why is pasta banned in Italy?</h2>
<p>To make Italy less reliant on imported wheat, Mussolini’s administration had started promoting rice—which was much easier to produce domestically—over pasta. In short, they believed that pasta weighed Italians down and prevented them from achieving any kind of greatness.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-word-spaghetti-originally-mean>What does the word spaghetti originally mean?</h2>
<p>Etymology. Spaghetti is the plural form of the Italian word spaghetto, which is a diminutive of spago, meaning “thin string” or “twine”.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-macaroni-pronounced>How is macaroni pronounced?</h2>
<p>mac-uh-ROW-nee<br>
Macaroni/Pronunciation</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-italians-get-their-pasta-from-the-arabs>How did the Italians get their pasta from the Arabs?</h2>
<p>It is thought, then, that pasta was introduced to Italy during the Arab conquests of Sicily in the 9th century AD, which had the interesting side effect of drastically influencing the region’s cuisine. It also known that by the 12th century, the Italians had learned from the Arabs methods for drying pasta to preserve it while traveling.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-pasta-do-they-eat-in-italy>What kind of pasta do they eat in Italy?</h2>
<p>Not here in Italy. Except in a few regions of the north, Italians don’t bother much with pasta fresca at all. Don’t get me wrong. Beautifully made pasta fresca is glorious, but for everyday meals, whether in high-priced Milanese restaurants or humble Tuscan farmhouses, Italian cooks rely on the stuff in the box.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-true-about-the-origin-of-pasta>Which is true about the origin of pasta?</h2>
<p>Myth: Pasta originally comes from Italy. Worldwide, pasta has become synonymous with Italian cuisine. Italian immigrants themselves brought pasta everywhere they went. While it is true that the most famous varieties and recipes of cooking pasta really do come from Italy, surprisingly, the actual origin of pasta lies elsewhere!</p>
<h2 id=how-did-pasta-get-from-china-to-italy>How did pasta get from China to Italy?</h2>
<p>It states that pasta was brought to Italy by Marco Polo via China. Polo ventured to China in the time of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) and the Chinese had been consuming noodles as early as 3000 B.C. in the Qinghai province. There is even some evidence there of 4,000-year-old noodles made from foxtail and broomcorn millet.</p>
