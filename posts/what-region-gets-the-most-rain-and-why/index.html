<h2 id=what-region-gets-the-most-rain-and-why>What region gets the most rain and why?</h2>
<p>Mawsynram, India Mawsynram, located in the Meghalaya State in India, is the wettest place in the world. It receives an annual rainfall of 11,871 millimeters. The mountainous terrain of the surrounding land forces the northward-moving warm moist monsoon winds coming from the Bay of Bengal to converge over Mawsynram.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-it-normally-rain-so-much-in-the-west-pacific>Why does it normally rain so much in the West Pacific?</h2>
<p>As the warm ocean surface warms the atmosphere above it, moisture-rich air rises and develops into rain clouds. So while the majority of precipitation tends to occur over the west Pacific warm pool in neutral years, much more develops over the central and eastern Pacific during an El Niño event.</p>
<h2 id=which-region-has-the-most-rainfall-and-the-highest-point>Which region has the most rainfall and the highest point?</h2>
<p>the wettest place on Earth has been known to change from time to time. In recent years, that title has gone to the town of Mawsynram, a village located in the East Khasi Hills district of northeastern, India. With an average annual rainfall of 11,872 millimetres (467.4 in), it is arguably the wettest place on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=which-region-has-the-most-rainfall>Which region has the most rainfall?</h2>
<p>Mawsynram, Meghalaya, India The place that records the highest rainfall on the Earth is Maysynram, located in Meghalaya, India. Located only 15 kms from Cherrapunji, villagers in Mawsynram use grass to soundproof their huts from the deafening rain that pelts their homes during the rainy season.</p>
<h2 id=does-la-nina-mean-less-rain>Does La Nina mean less rain?</h2>
<p>Rain clouds normally form over warm ocean water. La Niña blows all of this warm water to the western Pacific. This means that places like Indonesia and Australia can get much more rain than usual. However, the cold water in the eastern Pacific causes less rain clouds to form there.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-rain-does-the-pacific-islands-get>How much rain does the Pacific islands get?</h2>
<p>The orographic (mountain) features of the islands increase this annual average to about 70 inches but can exceed 240 inches in the wettest mountain areas. Rainfall is distributed unevenly across each high island, and rainfall gradients are extreme (approximately 25 inches per mile), creating very dry and wet areas.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-it-rain-so-much-in-the-pacific-northwest>Why does it rain so much in the Pacific Northwest?</h2>
<p>It rains in the Pacific Northwest, and it rains a lot. Despite the gorgeous landscapes and cosmopolitan cities, the western parts of Washington and Oregon get a bad rap for how gray and dismal they can be. But why exactly does it rain so much in the Pacific Northwest?</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-country-with-the-highest-rainfall-in-the-world>Which is the country with the highest rainfall in the world?</h2>
<p>Mawsynram in India receives the highest average annual rainfall in the world. Mawsynram, India, holds the record for the highest average annual rainfall in the world. Several regions in the world have the distinction of experiencing extremities of weather such as high temperatures and heavy rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-reason-behind-high-rainfall-in-equatorial-region>What is the reason behind high rainfall in equatorial region?</h2>
<p>So the reason why some equatorial regions have high rainfall is the proximity of a generally warm/hot climate and the presence of lots of oceans all around. Clean entertainment with faith and family values. Have faith in your entertainment and stream thousands of movies, series and more.</p>
