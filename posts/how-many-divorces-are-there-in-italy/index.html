<p>The divorce (rate) in Italy increased by 60% in 2020, (according to) Italy’s National Divorce Association (l’Associazione nazionale divorzisti italiani) In 40 percent of cases, the divorces were due to the fact that lockdown made it more difficult to (hide) infidelity and “double lives,” lawyers said.</p>
<h2 id=does-italy-have-a-low-divorce-rate>Does Italy have a low divorce rate?</h2>
<p>The divorce rate in Italy is still lower than in other large European countries. In 2016, there were 1.6 divorces in Italy for every 1,000 inhabitants.

<p>How long does the divorce process take in Italy? It is a two-step process: Separation and then Divorce. It generally takes 6-8 months to obtain a (provisional) Separation Order either by mutual consent, or whereby it is not viable, via a judicial decision granted by a judge.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-divorce-rate-in-italy-compared-to-other-countries>How is the divorce rate in Italy compared to other countries?</h2>

<h2 id=whats-the-easiest-way-to-get-a-divorce-in-italy>What’s the easiest way to get a divorce in Italy?</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, there are two ways of ending a marriage in Italy: by separation and by divorce. Until recently, separation was the simplest way of exiting a marriage in Italy. In May 2015, the Government passed a new law through which Italian divorce proceedings are significantly reduced.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-divorce-rate-in-the-world>What is the divorce rate in the world?</h2>
<p>For example, if 100,000 people live in a nation, and there are 500 divorces per year, working out this equation shows five divorces per 1,000 residents. There are other ways to calculate divorce rates, but we’ll be comparing the crude divorce rate of different nations around the world for this article.</p>
