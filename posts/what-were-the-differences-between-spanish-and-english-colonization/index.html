<h2 id=what-were-the-differences-between-spanish-and-english-colonization>What were the differences between Spanish and English colonization?</h2>
<p>Spanish developed extractive industries in precious metals, whereas English were more likely to establish economies based on trade. More royal control over Spanish colonies than English because English were settled to escape political and religious persecution.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-spanish-like-english>Why is Spanish like English?</h2>
<p>How and Why Are They So Similar? While Spanish is a Romance language and English is Germanic, a portion of the English language was influenced by Romance sources and vice-versa. Many centuries ago, as these languages were still fairly new, they began to merge as the Germanic and Roman people increased communication.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-no-the-same-in-spanish-and-english>Why is no the same in Spanish and English?</h2>
<p>Because Spanish is a Romance language (which means it evolved from Latin), many of its words are either inherited from Latin or derive from Latin words. Even though the words in this list are written the same in both languages, none of them are pronounced the same—not even the word no.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-english-colonies-differ-from-france-and-spain>How did the English colonies differ from France and Spain?</h2>
<p>The English colonists, on the other hand, enjoyed far more freedom and were able to govern themselves as long as they followed English law and were loyal to the king. In addition, unlike France and Spain, England encouraged immigration from other nations, thus boosting its colonial popula- tion.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spanish-and-the-british-colonize-the-new-world>How did the Spanish and the British colonize the New World?</h2>
<p>Although the Spanish and the British started colonizing the new world relatively at the same time their colonization efforts we’re extremely different but had some overlapping similarities.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-britain-and-spain>What was the relationship between Britain and Spain?</h2>
<p>The approaches Britain and Spain had towards colonization were reflected in their treatment of Native Americans. Ultimately, both countries were primarily interested in the expansion of their empires, the enrichment of their economies and their own political power, and their treatment of the natives is indicative of these aims.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-spanish-colonies>What are the names of the Spanish colonies?</h2>
<p>Spanish Colonies Crown-sponsored conquests gained rich- es for Spain and expanded its empire. Most of the southern and southwestern regions claimed, as well as sections of the California coast. Settlements include St. Augustine, Florida (1565); Santa Fe, New Mexico (1610); and numerous cities in Texas and California.</p>
