<h2 id=how-are-florida-electoral-votes-determined>How are Florida electoral votes determined?</h2>
<p>Electoral votes are allocated among the States based on the Census. Every State is allocated a number of votes equal to the number of senators and representatives in its U.S. Congressional delegation—two votes for its senators in the U.S. Senate plus a number of votes equal to the number of its Congressional districts.</p>
<h2 id=is-florida-all-or-nothing-electoral-college>Is Florida All or Nothing Electoral College?</h2>
<p>Currently, there are 538 electors, based on 435 representatives, 100 senators from the fifty states and three electors from Washington, D.C. The six states with the most electors are California (55), Texas (38), New York (29), Florida (29), Illinois (20), and Pennsylvania (20).</p>

<h2 id=is-electoral-college-winner-take-all>Is Electoral College winner-take-all?</h2>
<p>How does a candidate win a state’s electoral votes? Voters in each state choose electors by casting a vote for the presidential candidate of their choice. The slate winning the most popular votes is the winner. Only two states, Nebraska and Maine, do not follow this winner-take-all method.</p>

<h2 id=which-states-do-not-use-the-winner-take-all-system>Which states do not use the winner-take-all system?</h2>
<p>Voters in each state choose electors by casting a vote for the presidential candidate of their choice. The slate winning the most popular votes is the winner. Only two states, Nebraska and Maine, do not follow this winner-take-all method. In those states, electoral votes are proportionally allocated.</p>
<h2 id=are-counties-winner-take-all>Are counties winner-take-all?</h2>
<p>Currently, as in most states, California’s votes in the electoral college are distributed in a winner-take-all manner; whichever presidential candidate wins the state’s popular vote wins all 55 of the state’s electoral votes.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-number-of-delegates-in-each-state-determined>How are the number of Delegates in each state determined?</h2>
<p>The number of delegates in each state depends on that state’s population, similar to how the number of electoral votes depends on that state’s population. Given this, California has the highest number of delegates, with 494 for the Democratic convention and 172 for the Republican convention.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-delegates-are-in-the-state-of-alaska>How many delegates are in the state of Alaska?</h2>
<p>State Total Delegates Republican Delegates Democrat Delegates Alaska 648 172 476 South Carolina 392 155 237 Colorado 337 99 238 New Hampshire 272 95 177</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-delegate-rich-state-in-the-united-states>Which is the most delegate rich state in the United States?</h2>
<p>California is a key state for candidates because it is the most delegate-rich state in the U.S, followed by New York, with 320 Democratic and 94 Republican, and Texas, with 228 and 155 Republican. Wyoming and North Dakota have the fewest number of delegates, with 18 Democratic and 29 Republican each.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-delegates-chosen-in-the-primaries>How are the delegates chosen in the primaries?</h2>
<p>Delegates are either won by proportion, where the candidate receives a proportionate number of delegates to the number of votes in the state’s primary, or by a winner-takes-all method, where the candidate with the majority of votes in a state wins all of that state’s delegates.</p>
