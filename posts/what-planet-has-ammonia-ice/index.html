<h2 id=what-planet-has-ammonia-ice>What planet has ammonia ice?</h2>
<p>An unusually pure cloud of young, fresh ammonia ice has been found on Jupiter by NASA’s Galileo spacecraft, the first discrete cloud of ammonia ice ever seen, though the planet is known to contain ammonia gas.</p>
<h2 id=which-planet-has-ammonia-ice-near-the-cloud-top>Which planet has ammonia ice near the cloud top?</h2>
<p>This makes the atmosphere of Uranus the coldest in the solar system. Within the troposphere are layers of clouds — water clouds at the lowest pressures, with ammonium hydrosulfide clouds above them.</p>
<h2 id=which-planet-has-a-yellow-atmosphere-of-ammonia-and-many-rings-made-of-ice-and-rock>Which planet has a yellow atmosphere of ammonia and many rings made of ice and rock?</h2>
<p>Saturn is the second largest planet in the Solar System after Jupiter. Like Jupiter, it is a Gas Giant planet and has no solid surface. It’s yellow colour comes from ammonia in the atmosphere. It is most well known for its dramatic and beautiful ring system.</p>
<h2 id=does-saturn-have-ammonia-ice>Does Saturn have ammonia ice?</h2>
<p>Saturn also has clouds made of ammonia ice crystals, but the clouds tops are considerably colder than Jupiter’s approaching -400 degrees F. However starting around -300 degrees F., the ammonia would be frozen right out of the clouds.</p>
<h2 id=does-venus-have-ice>Does Venus have ice?</h2>
<p>The surface of Venus is the hottest in the solar system! Venus is too hot to have any type of ice on it. The surface of Venus is covered by its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide. These ices could exist in the coldest places on Earth, but the substances do not exist naturally in sufficient amounts.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-jovian-lightning>What is Jovian lightning?</h2>
<p>An unexpected form of electrical discharge, ‘shallow lightning’ originates from Jovian clouds containing an ammonia-water solution, according to a new analysis of data collected by the Stellar Reference Unit instrument onboard NASA’s Juno spacecraft.</p>
<h2 id=what-color-are-the-8-planets>What color are the 8 planets?</h2>
<p>Colour therapy is also the foundation for Vedic gem therapy and basic colours of the planets are: SUN—Red (transparent), MOON—White (opaque), MARS—Red (opaque), MERCURY—Green, JUPITER- Yellow, VENUS—White (transparent), SATURN—Blue.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-earths-twin>Who is Earth’s twin?</h2>
<p>Venus<br>
Venus is sometimes called Earth’s twin because Venus and Earth are almost the same size, have about the same mass (they weigh about the same), and have a very similar composition (are made of the same material). They are also neighboring planets. However, Venus and Earth are also very different.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-5-facts-about-saturn>What are 5 facts about Saturn?</h2>
<p>Here are some fun facts about the Ringed Planet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saturn is huge.</li>
<li>You cannot stand on Saturn.</li>
<li>Its beautiful rings are not solid.</li>
<li>Some of these bits are as small as grains of sand.</li>
<li>The rings are huge but thin.</li>
<li>Other planets have rings.</li>
<li>Saturn could float in water because it is mostly made of gas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-liquids-are-on-saturn>What liquids are on Saturn?</h2>
<p>It is enveloped by liquid metallic hydrogen inside a layer of liquid hydrogen –similar to Jupiter’s core but considerably smaller. It’s hard to imagine, but Saturn is the only planet in our solar system with an average density that is less than water.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-colors-of-ammonia-ice-clouds>What are the colors of ammonia ice clouds?</h2>
<p>What is puzzling about the clouds is their color. The ammonia ice clouds should be white, yet they have a variety or red, orange, yellow, and brown colors. Sunlight striking the clouds causes photochemical reactions with the molecules in the clouds.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-clouds-on-jupiter-so-cold>What makes the clouds on Jupiter so cold?</h2>
<p>Clouds on Jupiter are made of hydrogen, with trace amounts of ammonia, methane, and water. Jupiter is much colder than Earth, with an outer temperature of roughly -150 C. A cloud is a visible mass of condensed water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere above Earth’s (or another planetary body’s) surface.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-clouds-on-other-planets-without-water>Are there clouds on other planets without water?</h2>
<p>Clouds can form without water. Clouds of liquid water droplets exist on Earth and on Venus (at high enough altitude that the temperature is reasonable), but clouds containing water ice crystals are found on Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.Clouds of ammonia and methane are found on Jupiter out.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-clouds-of-uranus-and-neptune-blue>Why are the clouds of Uranus and Neptune Blue?</h2>
<p>Uranus and Neptune both have a blue color. Instead of ammonia clouds, their clouds are made of frozen methane crystals because they are much colder than Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
