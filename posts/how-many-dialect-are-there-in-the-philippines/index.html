<h2 id=how-many-dialect-are-there-in-the-philippines>How many dialect are there in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>111 dialects<br>
The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-so-many-people-speak-english-in-the-philippines>Why do so many people speak English in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>4 Main Reasons Why Filipinos Speak English So Well. First and most important reason: The American influence on the education system. They introduced a free education system and even sent teachers from America to help spread the language and made all teachers speak English in school.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-real-name-of-the-philippines>What is the real name of the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos, during his expedition in 1542, named the islands of Leyte and Samar “Felipinas” after Philip II of Spain, then the Prince of Asturias. Eventually the name “Las Islas Filipinas” would be used to cover the archipelago’s Spanish possessions.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-major-religion-in-the-philippines>What is the major religion in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Roman Catholic<br>
The Philippines proudly boasts to be the only Christian nation in Asia. More than 86 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, 6 percent belong to various nationalized Christian cults, and another 2 percent belong to well over 100 Protestant denominations.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-dialects-are-there-in-the-philippines>How many dialects are there in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>When it comes to dialects, there are eight of them in this country. They are: Tagalog, Waray, Bikol, Cebuano, Ilocano, Kapampangan, Hiligaynon, and Pangasinan. Out of these, Tagalog’s variety known as Filipino is recognized as the official language of the country. English also enjoys the same status in the constitution of Philippines.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-other-languages-besides-tagalog-in-the-philippines>Are there any other languages besides Tagalog in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>But somehow when you travel to the Philippines in different places or province there are many dialects that Filipino can speak aside from Tagalog and English. Because Filipino was influenced by many other languages in the history of the Philippines.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-third-language-in-the-philippines>Is there a third language in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>While Filipinos are unified by 2 languages (one being English and the other being Tagalog), almost all Filipinos have a third language, which is their local dialect. There are over 170 dialects that are present in The Philippines.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-english-become-the-official-language-of-the-philippines>When did English become the official language of the Philippines?</h2>
<p>The present constitution, ratified in 1987, designates Filipino and English as joint official languages. Filipino also had the distinction of being a national language that was to be “developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages.”.</p>
