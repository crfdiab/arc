<h2 id=what-did-the-18th-and-21st-amendment-deal-with>What did the 18th and 21st Amendment deal with?</h2>
<p>The movement reached its apex in 1919 when Congress ratified the 18th Amendment, prohibiting the manufacture, transportation and sale of intoxicating liquors. In 1933, widespread public disillusionment led Congress to ratify the 21st Amendment, which repealed Prohibition.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-the-21st-amendment>What is the purpose of the 21st Amendment?</h2>
<p>In 1933, the 21st Amendment to the Constitution was passed and ratified, ending national Prohibition. After the repeal of the 18th Amendment, some states continued Prohibition by maintaining statewide temperance laws.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-prohibition-repealed-at-the-federal-level>When was prohibition repealed at the federal level?</h2>
<p>Nine months later, on December 5, 1933, Prohibition was repealed at the federal level with the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment (which allowed prohibition to be maintained at the state and local levels, however). This article was most recently revised and updated by Jeff Wallenfeldt, Manager, Geography and History.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-prohibition-in-the-18th-amendment>What was the prohibition in the 18th Amendment?</h2>
<p>II. The Amendment. Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-21st-amendment-repeal-the-18th-amendment>How did the 21st Amendment repeal the 18th Amendment?</h2>
<p>That would repeal the 18th Amendment (the “prohibition amendment”). On February 20, 1933, Congress enabled states to ratify the proposed 21st Amendment if they chose. To become an amendment to the Constitution, it needed to be ratified by 36 of the then-existing 48 states. Most states ratified rather quickly, as this list shows. II.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-prohibition-movement-reach-its-apex>When did the prohibition movement reach its apex?</h2>
<p>By the late 1800s, prohibition movements had sprung up across the United States, driven by religious groups who considered alcohol, specifically drunkenness, a threat to the nation. The movement reached its apex in 1919 when Congress ratified the 18th Amendment, prohibiting the manufacture, transportation and sale of intoxicating liquors.</p>
