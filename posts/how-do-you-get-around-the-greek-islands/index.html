<h2 id=how-do-you-get-around-the-greek-islands>How do you get around the Greek islands?</h2>
<p>The best way to travel among these islands is by boarding a fast ferry. The ferry travel times between these Greek islands vary from 2 hours to 45 minutes (Paros-Naxos). The three islands can also make an excellent escape from the bustle of Santorini and are perfect options for a one-day trip or a weekend away.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-sail-the-greek-islands>Can you sail the Greek islands?</h2>
<p>As anyone who has done it will tell you, the best way to visit the Greek Islands and the coast of mainland Greece is by sailboat. There are a large number of yacht companies, skipper-owners, flotillas, cabin cruises and even day sails cruising the Aegean and Ionian seas of Greece.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-greek-island-hopping-cost>How much does Greek island hopping cost?</h2>
<p>The Greek Island ferries can range from less than 10 Euros to around 100 Euros per person for a round trip. If you’re only going one way each time, this will cut your costs in half, but book a round trip if you’re only visiting two islands. An average ferry will probably set you back around 50 Euros.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-sail-around-the-greek-islands>How long does it take to sail around the Greek islands?</h2>
<p>As it’s your own private boat, you can set off whenever suits you. A typical day will include four to six hours of sailing so there will be plenty of time to explore your overnight destination in a little more depth, or leave a little earlier and have more time to anchor off secluded beaches or bays as you sail by.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-sail-to-greece-from-the-us>Can you sail to Greece from the US?</h2>
<p>With the exception of epic around-the-world voyages, at the time of publication only a handful of cruises departing from the United States call at ports in Greece – all on their way to Italy. They range from 25 to 47 days and call at numerous other European countries in addition to Greece.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-sail-the-greek-islands>Is it possible to sail the Greek islands?</h2>
<p>Julian has sailed the Greek Islands since the 1980s, when he chartered a sailboat out of Alimos Marina, Athens, and slightly over-stayed, returning home in 2014. He worked as a charter and delivery skipper for six years and sailed a number of his own boats in Greece.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-ferries-that-take-you-to-greek-islands>Are there ferries that take you to Greek islands?</h2>
<p>Ferries move slowly, allowing travelers to gaze at islands along the way and to talk with locals. As with most independent travel, there can be complications. With some thought and patience, a Greek Island odyssey won’t leave you stranded on Calypso’s island or caught in the whirlpools of Cherybdis.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-go-on-a-boat-tour-in-greece>When is the best time to go on a boat tour in Greece?</h2>
<p>Explore a wide diversity of boat tours through Greek Islands. We have 16 tours that vary from 4 days to 15 days. With the greatest number of departures in September, this is also the most popular time of the year. “In August 2018 I did the Athens-Santorini tour, but unfortunately I was disappointed….”</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-travel-to-the-greek-islands>How much does it cost to travel to the Greek islands?</h2>
<p>Payment per trip is up to 15 euros as a foot passenger where you can sit anywhere on the boat, and slightly more if you would like to have a specified seat on the ship with a little more comfort! The ferries are comfortable and well equipped with everything you need for your Greek Islands journey.</p>
