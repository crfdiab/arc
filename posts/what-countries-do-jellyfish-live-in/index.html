<h2 id=what-countries-do-jellyfish-live-in>What countries do jellyfish live in?</h2>
<p>Jellyfish can be found in all ocean waters. Because jellyfish tend to just follow the currents of the ocean, they can be found around the world in every type of ocean water. They can thrive in warm tropical water or cold Arctic water. They’ve been found at the bottom of the ocean and near the surface.</p>
<h2 id=do-jellyfish-live-in-antarctica>Do jellyfish live in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Diplulmaris antarctica is a species of Antarctic jellyfish in the family Ulmaridae.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-jellyfish-in-africa>Are there jellyfish in Africa?</h2>
<p>Jellyfish have few identifying features and a highly variable body type. Our group has already found a new compass jelly off the southern coast of South Africa, along with a new species of rhizostome jellyfish that appears to be completely endemic to South Africa through some of our previous research.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-jellyfish-in-south-africa>Are there jellyfish in South Africa?</h2>
<p>Three specific species are found in South African waters – the Benguela compass jellyfish, the purple compass jellyfish, and the Cape compass jellyfish. Jellyfish are planktonic – meaning they drift around in the ocean – and the cause of these mass wash-ups may be attributed to a combination of wind and current.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-deadliest-jellyfish>What’s the deadliest jellyfish?</h2>
<p>Australian box jellyfish<br>
The Australian box jellyfish is considered the most venomous marine animal. They may not look dangerous, but the sting from a box jellyfish could be enough to send you to Davy Jones’s locker-a watery grave, that is.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-box-jellyfish-see>How do box jellyfish see?</h2>
<p>The jellyfish has six eye clusters. Each contains four very simple eyes consisting of pigment-filled pits to catch light, and a pair of more complex, lensed eyes. At just a tenth of a millimetre across, the lenses are made of material that has variable optical properties.</p>
<h2 id=does-it-help-to-pee-on-a-jellyfish-sting>Does it help to pee on a jellyfish sting?</h2>
<p>A: No. Despite what you may have heard, the idea of peeing on a jellyfish sting to ease the pain is just a myth. Not only are there no studies to support this idea, but pee may even worsen the sting. Jellyfish tentacles have stinging cells called nematocysts that contain venom.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-jellyfish-known-for>What are jellyfish known for?</h2>
<p>Jellyfish have tiny stinging cells in their tentacles to stun or paralyze their prey before they eat them. Inside their bell-shaped body is an opening that is its mouth. They eat and discard waste from this opening. As jellyfish squirt water from their mouths they are propelled forward.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-jellyfish-live-in-the-world>Where does the jellyfish live in the world?</h2>
<p>Their habitat is located in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans, as well as inland seas of the equator, the tropics, subtropics and temperate climate. The biological purpose of jellyfish is the purification of water from organic debris.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-jellyfish-found-in-the-uk>Which is the largest jellyfish found in the UK?</h2>
<p>Barrel jellyfish – The largest jellyfish found in UK seas. They are translucent with a huge mushroom shaped bell and a bunch of 8 frilly tentacles below. They don’t have marginal tentacles, but do have a violet fringe around the bell.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-jellyfish-that-have-infinite-lives>Are there any jellyfish that have infinite lives?</h2>
<p>In other words, this jellyfish, as its name suggests, can have infinite lives. While this type of jellyfish was originally discovered in the Mediterranean Sea, some Turritopsis were already found swarming the seas of Japan and the Atlantic ocean near Panama.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-the-jellyfish>What do you need to know about the jellyfish?</h2>
<p>Scientists have discovered jellyfish fossil snapshots in rocks believed to be more than 500 million years old. That makes them even older than dinosaurs! 2. Jellyfish don’t have brains They don’t have a heart, lungs or a brain either! So how does a jellyfish live without these vital organs?</p>
