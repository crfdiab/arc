<h2 id=why-california-has-more-electoral-votes>Why California has more electoral votes?</h2>
<p>There are a total of 538 electoral votes, and the number of votes each state receives is proportional to its size — the bigger the state’s population the more “votes” it gets. For California, this means we get 55 votes (2 senators and 53 members of the House of Representatives) — the most of any state.</p>
<h2 id=which-state-does-not-have-winner-takes-all>Which state does not have winner takes all?</h2>
<p>Voters in each state choose electors by casting a vote for the presidential candidate of their choice. The slate winning the most popular votes is the winner. Only two states, Nebraska and Maine, do not follow this winner-take-all method.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-electoral-votes-does-ca-get>How many electoral votes does CA get?</h2>
<p>Current allocations</p>
<table><tr><th>Alabama – 9 votes</th><th>Kentucky – 8 votes</th></tr><tr><td>California – 55 votes</td><td>Massachusetts – 11 votes</td></tr><tr><td>Colorado – 9 votes</td><td>Michigan – 16 votes</td></tr><tr><td>Connecticut – 7 votes</td><td>Minnesota – 10 votes</td></tr><tr><td>Delaware – 3 votes</td><td>Mississippi – 6 votes</td></tr></table>

<p>The 1988 United States presidential election was the 51st quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 1988. The Republican nominee, incumbent Vice President George H. W. Bush, defeated the Democratic nominee, Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.</p>
<h2 id=who-won-the-presidency-in-1988>Who won the presidency in 1988?</h2>
<p>In the 1988 presidential election, Republican Vice President George H. W. Bush defeated Democratic Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts. Bush won the popular vote by just under eight points, and won 426 of the 538 electoral votes.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-presidents-that-have-won-all-50-states>Are there any presidents that have won all 50 states?</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, there was not a single president in US history that managed to win all 50 states in the election. Ever since the United States started being composed of 50 states, no presidential candidate managed to win the majority of votes in all of the states.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-electoral-votes-does-california-have-now>How many electoral votes does California have now?</h2>
<p>In 1972, California reached 45 electoral votes, passing New York for most in the country. The state’s current allotted 55 electoral votes give California more than 10% of all available electoral votes in the country.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-electoral-votes-did-reagan-win-in-california>How many electoral votes did Reagan win in California?</h2>
<p>The incumbent president beat out Democratic candidate and former Vice President Walter Mondale with ease, carrying a historic 49 of 50 states and winning 525 of 538 electoral votes. Mondale only managed to win his home state of Minnesota and Washington, D.C. California gave its then-47 electoral votes to Reagan, helping him complete a very red map.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-who-won-his-home-state>Who was president who won his home state?</h2>
<p>Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Obama all carried their respective home states when they won. It’s happened w/ 2 presidents, or w/ 6 presidents depending on if you consider their home state to be where they were born in, or where their residence is. This link explains it all pretty well.</p>
