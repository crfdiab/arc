<h2 id=why-did-the-us-support-the-shah-of-iran-quizlet>Why did the US support the Shah of Iran quizlet?</h2>
<p>Iran was caught in the larger battle between the US and USSR during the Cold War, and became an important ally for the US. Iran shared a border with the Soviet Union, and so was logistically important. It also had oil. So the US supported the Shah of Iran, even though he was a dictator because he was anti-communist.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-the-us-support-in-the-iran-iraq-war>Who did the US support in the Iran Iraq war?</h2>
<p>[T]he United States actively supported the Iraqi war effort by supplying the Iraqis with billions of dollars of credits, by providing U.S. military intelligence and advice to the Iraqis, and by closely monitoring third country arms sales to Iraq to make sure that Iraq had the military weaponry required.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-shah-of-iran-overthrown>Why was the Shah of Iran overthrown?</h2>
<p>Its causes continue to be the subject of historical debate and are believed to have stemmed partly from a conservative backlash opposing the westernization, modernization and secularization efforts of the Western-backed Shah, as well as from a more popular reaction to social injustice and other shortcomings of the …</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-iran-hostage-crisis>What caused Iran hostage crisis?</h2>
<p>During rioting in 1963, the Shah cracked down, suppressing his opposition. When the Shah came to America for cancer treatment in October, the Ayatollah incited Iranian militants to attack the U.S. On November 4, the American Embassy in Tehran was overrun and its employees taken captive. The hostage crisis had begun.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-shah-allowed-to-come-to-the-us>Why was the Shah allowed to come to the US?</h2>
<p>Periodically, the official invitation to come to the United States was renewed, but the Shah had been persuaded by his own advisers and by Sadat that the chances of a return to power would be greater if he remained in the Middle East, where he could follow events in Teheran more closely.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-us-help-overthrow-the-shah-of-iran>When did the US help overthrow the Shah of Iran?</h2>
<p>The Shah became one of America’s most trusted Cold War allies, and U.S. economic and military aid poured into Iran during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. In 1978, however, anti-Shah and anti-American protests broke out in Iran and the Shah was toppled from power in 1979.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-shah-of-iran-entangle-america>How did the Shah of Iran entangle America?</h2>
<p>How the Shah Entangled America. Mohammed Reza Shah’s rule of Iran from 1942 until 1979 spanned eight U.S. presidents. His desire for military supremacy over his neighbors and his distrust of the Soviets led him to seek a military relationship with the United States following the end of the Second World War.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-mohammad-reza-pahlavi-go-to-seek-treatment>Where did Mohammad Reza Pahlavi go to seek treatment?</h2>
<p>In 1979, the Shah left Iran. First, the Shah found refuge in the Bahamas but was later forced to leave. He then sought treatment in Mexico. Multiple recommendations urged the Shah to seek treatment in the United States. In response, the Shah stated: “How could I go to a place [USA] that had undone me?”</p>
