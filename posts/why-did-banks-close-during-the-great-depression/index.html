<p>Banks Needed Fixing By 1933, the wave of bank failures was stemmed by the decision of the newly elected president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, to declare a four-day banking “holiday” while Congress debated and passed the Emergency Banking Act, which formed the basis of the 1933 Banking Act, or Glass-Steagall Act.</p>

<p>Failure. When a bank fails, the FDIC reimburses account holders with cash from the deposit insurance fund. The FDIC insures accounts up to $250,000, per account holder, per institution. The FDIC also provides additionally insurance coverage for pay-on-death beneficiaries.</p>

<p>Deflation harmed the economy in many ways. Deflation forced banks, firms, and debtors into bankruptcy; distorted economic decision-making; reduced consumption; and increased unemployment.</p>

<p>Another phenomenon that compounded the nation’s economic woes during the Great Depression was a wave of banking panics or “bank runs,” during which large numbers of anxious people withdrew their deposits in cash, forcing banks to liquidate loans and often leading to bank failure.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-stock-market-crash-affect-the-economy>How did the stock market crash affect the economy?</h2>
<p>After the crash, panic made a bad situation worse. Public panic in the days after the stock market crash led to hordes of people rushing to banks to withdraw their funds in a number of “bank runs,” and investors were unable to return their money because bank officials had invested the money in the market.</p>

<p>4. Silver did not fare so well during stock market crashes. In fact, it rose in only one of the S&P selloffs and was basically flat in another one. This is likely due to silver’s high industrial use (about 56% of total supply) and that stock market selloffs are usually associated with a poor or deteriorating economy.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-stock-market-crash-in-2008>When did the stock market crash in 2008?</h2>
<p>The stock market crash of 2008 occurred on September 29, 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 777.68 points in intra-day trading. Until 2018, it was the largest point drop in history. It plummeted because Congress rejected the bank bailout bill.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-banks-affected-by-the-stock-market-downturn>How are banks affected by the stock market downturn?</h2>
<p>Banks are often hit again in this downturn, when many consumers can no longer pay their mortgages. Retail banks increasingly offer their customers investment services. Merrill Lynch, for many years one of Wall Street’s larger brokerage and investment houses, is now an integral part of the Bank of America.</p>
