<p>Oct. 1, 331 bc<br>
Battle of Gaugamela, also called Battle of Arbela, (Oct. 1, 331 bc) battle in which Alexander the Great completed his conquest of Darius III’s Persian Empire.</p>

Battle of Gaugamela/End dates<br>
On 1 October 331 BC, Alexander the Great won a definitive victory at Gaugamela against the Persian empire. Alexander’s charismatic leadership and brilliant use of cavalry secured his immortality, and signalled the end for his wily foe, the Persian ruler Darius III.</p>

<p>It was the second and final battle between the two kings, and is considered to be the final blow to the Achaemenid Empire, resulting in Alexander’s complete conquest of the empire. It was a decisive victory for the League of Corinth, and it led to the fall of Achaemenid Empire and of Darius III.</p>

<p>Victory. In all, Arrian states that over 300,000 Persians were killed and more captured, with only 100 Macedonian dead. These figures are almost certainly grossly inflated. A more conservative estimate is 40,000 Persian dead, and Alexander himself claimed that his army suffered about 500 killed and 5,000 wounded.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-alexander-the-great-so-successful-in-battle>Why was Alexander the Great so successful in battle?</h2>
<p>His ability to dream, plan and strategize on a large scale allowed him to win many battles, even when he was outnumbered. It also helped motivate his men, who knew they were part of one of the greatest conquests in history. Alexander could be inspiring and courageous, continued Abernethy.</p>

<p>Indian war elephants in the Achaemenid army at the Battle of Gaugamela It is possible that the Persian army could have numbered over 100,000 men. One estimate is that there were 25,000 peltasts, 10,000 Immortals, 2,000 Greek hoplites, 1,000 Bactrians, and 40,000 cavalry, 200 scythed chariots, and 15 war elephants.</p>

<p>When Alexander attacked them with his cavalry force ahead of the rest of his army, the Persian cavalry fled. Most of them escaped, but some were killed or taken prisoner. The prisoners told the Macedonians that Darius was not far away, with his encampment near Gaugamela.</p>

<p>Alexander Mosaic (depicting the Battle of Issus or the Battle of Gaugamela), from the House of the Faun, Pompeii (VI, 12, 2), Roman era, National Archaeological Museum, Naples, Italy. (Lucas/ CC BY SA 2.0 )</p>
<h2 id=why-did-darius-want-to-repeat-the-battle-of-gaugamela>Why did Darius want to repeat the Battle of Gaugamela?</h2>
<p>The use of the scorched-earth tactic and scythed chariots by Darius suggests that he wanted to repeat that battle. Alexander would have been unable to adequately supply his army if he had taken the southern route, even if the scorched-earth tactic had failed.</p>
