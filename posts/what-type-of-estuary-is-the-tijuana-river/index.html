<h2 id=what-type-of-estuary-is-the-tijuana-river>What type of estuary is the Tijuana River?</h2>
<p>intertidal coastal wetland<br>
The Tijuana River Estuary is an intertidal coastal wetland at the mouth of the Tijuana River in San Diego County, California, in the United States bordering Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico….</p>
<table><tr><th>Tijuana River Estuary</th></tr><tr><td>Designated</td><td>1973</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=are-there-mountains-in-tijuana-mexico>Are there mountains in Tijuana Mexico?</h2>
<p>Mountains run along both Mexico’s Pacific coast and the Gulf coast – the Sierra Madre Occidental range on the west and the Sierra Madre Oriental range on the east.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-tijuana-get-its-water>Where does Tijuana get its water?</h2>
<p>Officials said it was needed to protect the levels of one of Tijuana’s main reservoirs from dropping too low. It and Tijuana’s other reservoirs are filled with Colorado River water, pumped more than 100 miles from Mexicali. That river, originating in the Rocky Mountains, provides 90 percent of the city’s water.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-tijuana-river-flow-north>Does the Tijuana River flow north?</h2>
<p>The Tijuana River rises in the Sierra de Juárez of northern Baja California, approximately 45 mi (70 km) ENE of Ensenada. It flows WNW through Tijuana, crossing the border approximately 5 mi (8 km) from the Pacific. It flows west, just skirting the international border south of the San Ysidro section of San Diego.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-tijuana-river-polluted>Why is the Tijuana River polluted?</h2>
<p>The smell is really nasty.” Every time it rains, the Tijuana River floods the valley. However, the river has been polluted with millions of gallons of raw sewage from Mexico. That raw sewage and accompanying dangerous toxins eventually work their way through the Tijuana Estuary and out to local beaches.</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-live-in-tijuana-mexico>What animals live in Tijuana Mexico?</h2>
<p>We have over 370 species of birds, brush rabbits, jack rabbits, lizards, squirrels, grey foxes, and coyotes. In the Border Field area you may still find the bobcat but it is unusual. We do have rattlesnakes but they are rarely seen north of the river and are more common at Border Field.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-murders-are-there-in-tijuana>How many murders are there in Tijuana?</h2>
<p>TIJUANA (Border Report) — Tijuana is once again on track to be named the most dangerous city in the world. With the rate of 138 homicides per 100,000 residents, almost six people are killed every day in Tijuana, according to the Citizens Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-murders-have-there-been-in-tijuana-2020>How many murders have there been in Tijuana 2020?</h2>
<p>4,000 homicides<br>
The border city of Tijuana saw over 4,000 homicides in 2020, or almost 12% of the national total.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-tijuana-smell-bad>Why does Tijuana smell bad?</h2>
<p>Every time it rains, the Tijuana River floods the valley. However, the river has been polluted with millions of gallons of raw sewage from Mexico. That raw sewage and accompanying dangerous toxins eventually work their way through the Tijuana Estuary and out to local beaches. The problem has been going on for decades.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-san-diego-smell-bad-right-now-2021>Why does San Diego smell bad right now 2021?</h2>
<p>Michael Latz of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego posted on the institution’s website this week. The odor is caused by a large red tide that was first observed at a mooring off the Scripps Pier on March 25, eventually becoming visible from the shore as reddish-brown water on April 4.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-tijuana-river-drain-into-the-ocean>Where does the Tijuana River drain into the ocean?</h2>
<p>The Tijuana River drains an arid area along the U.S.—Mexico border, flowing through Mexico for most its course then crossing the border into Southern California for its lower 5 mi (8 km) to empty into the ocean in an estuary on the southern edge of San Diego .</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-tijuana-river-valley-regional-park>Where is the Tijuana River Valley Regional Park?</h2>
<p>The Tijuana River Valley Regional Park is located in the Tijuana River Valley district of San Diego. It protects over 1,800 acres (730 ha), including dense riparian forests along the Tijuana River.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-tijuana-river-research-reserve>How big is the Tijuana River research reserve?</h2>
<p>The Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve protects 2,293 acres (928 ha) and studies the Tijuana River Estuary. It was established as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve system in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-san-diego-start-using-the-tijuana-river>When did San Diego start using the Tijuana River?</h2>
<p>In the 1960s an emergency link from Tijuana into the San Diego Water System was created, by the mid-1980s it was taking in about 15 million gallons a day of sewage. During the 1970s, up to ten million gallons of sewage entered the river each day from Tijuana.</p>
