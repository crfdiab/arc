<h2 id=how-did-england-control-colonial-trade>How did England control colonial trade?</h2>
<p>The concept was mercantilism. By tariffs, navigation acts, and taxes England attempted to monopolize all trade with the American colonies.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-british-think-about-colonial-trade>What did the British think about colonial trade?</h2>
<p>Britain believed that trading with other nations would not benefit the colonies. Britain believed the colonies should develop an independent economy. Britain wanted the colonies to offer other nations poor goods at high prices. Britain did not want trade with the colonies to enrich its competitors.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-england-want-colonial-trade>Why did England want colonial trade?</h2>
<p>Trade was restricted so the colonies had to rely on Britain for imported goods and supplies. There were no banks and very little money, so colonists used barter and credit to get the things they needed. Following the French and Indian War, Britain wanted to control expansion into the western territories.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-america-separate-from-britain>Why did America separate from Britain?</h2>
<p>With the French and Indian War over, many colonists saw no need for soldiers to be stationed in the colonies. Britain also needed money to pay for its war debts. The King and Parliament believed they had the right to tax the colonies. They protested, saying that these taxes violated their rights as British citizens.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-british-trade-with-the-colonies>How did the British trade with the colonies?</h2>
<p>British officials estimated that nearly £700,000 of illicit goods was brought into the American colonies annually. Pirates, or what colonists considered privateers, also helped to perpetuate the illegal trading activities by providing a buffer between merchants and foreign ships.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-english-do-about-illegal-trading>What did the English do about illegal trading?</h2>
<p>England sought to assert itself as the maritime master and attempted to combat the colonists’ illegal trading activities. It passed more laws throughout the 17th century that forbade illegal trading. When this did not work, the English began to attack those who actively engaged in trade.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-england-control-raw-materials-in-the-colonies>How did England control raw materials in the colonies?</h2>
<p>What raw materials that England could not used could be sold by British merchants for a profit to other countries. England could control the cost and assign a value to the raw materials from the colonies much less than the value of the goods on a global open market.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-british-empire-trade-with-china>What did the British Empire trade with China?</h2>
<p>The positive effects of Great Britain’s rule was that the British gained more natural resources such as gold, ivory and rubber. Britain got these when they established trading posts that gained more money as well as the natural resources. What did the British Empire trade with China?</p>
