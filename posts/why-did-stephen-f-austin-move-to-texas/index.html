<h2 id=why-did-stephen-f-austin-move-to-texas>Why did Stephen F Austin move to Texas?</h2>
<p>The economic panic of 1819 led his father, Moses Austin (1767–1821), to leave his lead-mining business in Missouri and embark upon a scheme of colonization in Texas. Moses obtained a grant of land from the Mexican government but died soon thereafter, and in 1821 Stephen went to Texas to carry out his father’s project.</p>
<h2 id=did-stephen-f-austin-bring-first-300-families-to-texas>Did Stephen F Austin bring first 300 families to Texas?</h2>
<p>Austin’s first colony. In January 1821 Austin’s father, Moses Austin, had received a permit from the Spanish to settle 300 families in Texas, but he died in Missouri a short time later before he could realize his plans. In all, 307 titles were issued, with nine families receiving two titles each.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-stephen-f-austin-go-to-mexico-city>When did Stephen F. Austin go to Mexico City?</h2>
<p>In 1833 Austin went to Mexico City to clear up some business with the Mexican Federal government. He was bringing new demands from the Texas settlers, including separation from Coahuila (Texas and Coahuila were one state at the time) and reduced taxes.</p>

<p>Stephen Austin’s planned settlement of Texas hit many snags between 1821 and 1830, not the least of which was the fact that Mexico achieved independence in 1821, meaning he had to re-negotiate his father’s grant.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-stephen-f-austin-go-to-college>Where did Stephen F Austin go to college?</h2>
<p>Stephen F. Austin moved to Arkansas, and then to Louisiana, intending to study law at New Orleans. Meanwhile, Moses Austin headed for Texas, in Spanish-ruled Mexico, to apply for a grant of land and permission to settle 300 families there.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-stephen-f-austin-when-he-started-working>How old was Stephen F Austin when he started working?</h2>
<p>At age 17, Austin returned to Missouri and began work at his father’s side, operating a general store for the mine. By age 23 he was managing the lead mine while his father moved on to other speculative ventures. Even as a young man Austin was recognized for his maturity and leadership abilities.</p>
