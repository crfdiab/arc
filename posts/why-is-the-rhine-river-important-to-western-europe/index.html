<h2 id=why-is-the-rhine-river-important-to-western-europe>Why is the Rhine River important to Western Europe?</h2>
<p>The Rhine is western Europe’s most important waterway. It rises in the Alps, and passes through Switzerland, France, Germany and the Netherlands before flowing into the North sea. The river is 1,320 kilometres long, and, because it is navigable from Basel to Rotterdam, it serves as a highway for Europe’s freight.</p>
<h2 id=how-clean-is-the-rhine>How clean is the Rhine?</h2>
<p>Between Basel and Rotterdam, the Rhine has one of the highest microplastics pollution so far measured in rivers, with the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area showing peak numbers of up to four times the average. Among investigated rivers, the Rhine is thus among those most heavily polluted with microplastics.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-does-the-rhine-river-have-on-transportation-in-europe>What impact does the Rhine River have on transportation in Europe?</h2>
<p>As it continues on its way to the North sea, the Rhine flows over the famous Rhine Falls at Schaffhausen and through the industrial town of Basel. There it becomes is a major transport route through Europe; transporting goods and raw materials by ship….Rivers.</p>

<h2 id=can-you-swim-in-the-rhine>Can you swim in the Rhine?</h2>
<p>Swimming in the Rhine is free of charge. Participation in the official Rhine swim is also free. For a fee, you can use the showers, toilets and changing rooms at Rheinbad Breite and Rheinbad St. Johann.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-rhine-river-cleaned-up-in-1986>Why was the Rhine river cleaned up in 1986?</h2>
<p>In 1986 an environmental catastrophe provided further impetus to clean up the river. On November 1, a fire broke out in Basel’s Schweizerhalle, and toxic chemicals from the Sandoz plant leaked into the Rhine. Thousands of fish died, and some species, such as the eel, were wiped out.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-clean-a-river>What’s the best way to clean a river?</h2>
<p>In the world there are different solutions that involve the use of fixed and/or mobile barriers, but compared to these river cleaning offers better solutions: compared to a rigid barrier it does not risk breaking, nor being submerged by a greater flow of water;</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-river-cleaning-system-help-the-environment>How does the river cleaning system help the environment?</h2>
<p>The River Cleaning System collects energy directly from the river current. It does not need auxiliary power, and does not produce any type of waste. It is designed to have zero impact on the ecosystem. It only does good!</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-rhine-river-important-to-europe>Why is the Rhine River important to Europe?</h2>
<p>The Commission was born, appropriately enough, in Basel. In 1963, the countries through which the Rhine flows signed a convention to protect the river. This set ambitious goals for reducing pollution, and efforts were made to get the factories on the river’s banks to cut their waste emissions.</p>
