<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-have-a-cherry-bomb-exhaust>Is it legal to have a cherry bomb exhaust?</h2>
<p>Are Cherry Bomb exhausts legal? AFAIK there is no type approval for individual car exhaust pipe parts. So you can make your own or use whatever. Thus a Cherry Bomb won’t in and of itself be illegal.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-cherry-bomb-count-as-a-muffler>Does a cherry bomb count as a muffler?</h2>
<p>Several people commonly refer to the Glasspack Muffler as the Cherry Bomb Muffler due to its really great sound muffling abilities. These mufflers are also much better than ordinary mufflers, as they do not allow the sound to resonate back into the engine.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-have-straight-pipes-in-texas>Is it illegal to have straight pipes in Texas?</h2>
<p>The law does not specifically answer how loud a motorized vehicle can be, but it does say that a vehicle must have a good working muffler that prevents “excessive or unusual noise.” So any cutouts or bypasses, straight pipes or rusted-out mufflers and exhaust with holes are all illegal.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-pass-emissions-with-a-cherry-bomb>Can I pass emissions with a cherry bomb?</h2>
<p>The cherry bomb is illegal. It falls under section 75(1) of the HTA. It’s the same thing as a hollywood muffler. Just letting you know, so if you do get a ticket it doesn’t come as a surprise.</p>
<h2 id=do-cherry-bombs-add-horsepower>Do cherry bombs add horsepower?</h2>
<p>Cherry Bomb began manufacturing the Cherry Bomb Glasspack in 1968. With less backpressure, the muffler increased horsepower and produced an unmistakable sound that embodied the power under the hood. They feature larger-diameter pipes and free-flowing mufflers to better scavenge exhaust gas from the engine.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-cherry-bomb-a-silencer>Is a cherry bomb a silencer?</h2>
<p>Cherry bombs® feature a straight through silencer designed for extracting exhaust gases quicker, assisting the engine and giving more power when needed. Constructed in heavy gauge steel to ensure the products reliability. Finished in heat resistant cherry red paint this product not only sounds good but looks good too.</p>
<h2 id=do-cherry-bombs-get-louder-over-time>Do cherry bombs get louder over time?</h2>
<p>Over time, the glass within the glass packed muffler, or cherry bomb, starts disappearing. That creates an even louder exhaust note and rumble. As a rule of thumb, the older the glass packs, the louder they become.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-muffler-delete-illegal-in-texas>Is a muffler delete illegal in Texas?</h2>
<p>Mufflers are required on all vehicles and must prevent unusual or excessive noise. Mufflers with bypasses or cutouts are not permitted.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-cherry-bomb-glasspack-legal>Is a cherry bomb glasspack legal?</h2>
<p>AFAIK there is no type approval for individual car exhaust pipe parts. So you can make your own or use whatever. Thus a Cherry Bomb won’t in and of itself be illegal. So long as it meets the prevailing rules on noise levels you can use what you like.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-cherry-bomb-any-car>Can you cherry bomb any car?</h2>
<p>Cherry Bomb has mufflers for just about every vehicle out there and we’ve got the project vehicles to prove it!</p>
<h2 id=will-a-cherry-bomb-fit-any-car>Will a cherry bomb fit any car?</h2>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-cherry-bomb-exhaust>What do you need to know about Cherry Bomb exhaust?</h2>
<p>Cherry Bomb Exhaust is simply a brand name for a glass packed exhaust muffler. This glass packed straight through tube, which is usually a little larger in diameter than your stock exhaust pipes, replaces the stock muffler. Glass is packed around the whole diameter of this tubular muffler,…</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-cherry-bomb-muffler-come-out>When did the Cherry Bomb muffler come out?</h2>
<p>Since 1968 In the world of high-performance mufflers, Cherry Bomb is the brand that stands apart. Originally, it was a name for a Glasspack muffler, first built back in 1968 by the Maremont company. It had a simple straight-through design, essentially a long straight tube with a baffled channel filled with fiberglass.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-cherry-bomb-or-glass-bomb>Which is better Cherry Bomb or glass bomb?</h2>
<p>The end result is a lot less muffled sound as compared to stock mufflers. Glass packs, A.K.A. cherry bombs, do not increase engine performance, they are more of an inexpensive way to bring out a throaty and healthy exhaust note from an engine, right from low RPM’s. (Several glasspack brands and information could be found here ).</p>
