<h2 id=what-year-was-my-pfaff-sewing-machine-made>What year was my Pfaff sewing machine made?</h2>
<p>All Pfaff machines have a serial number, allowing the owner to determine what year the machine was made. For instance, machines manufactured in 1862, the first year of Pfaff machines, have 1 as their serial number.</p>

<p>Pfaff sewing machine factory in Kaiserslautern, Germany. Today the PFAFF® sewing machine brand continues to make history as the premier sewing machine brand that sewers aspire to own.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-a-pfaff-sewing-machine-last>How long does a Pfaff sewing machine last?</h2>
<p>My sense is that quality machines from recent decades easily last for thousands of hours of stitching over 10–20 years. Even cheaper-than-Pfaff plastic machines can last for a few thousand hours of sewing.</p>
<h2 id=is-pfaff-a-good-sewing-machine-brand>Is Pfaff a good sewing machine brand?</h2>
<p>European quality, Pfaff sewing machines are made to last years and years and will give faultless stitch results. The brand have a reputation as being one of the strongest on the market today, with a huge advantage of its unique built in dual fabric feeding system called IDT (Integrated Dual Transportation).</p>
<h2 id=are-pfaff-sewing-machines-any-good>Are Pfaff sewing machines any good?</h2>
<p>Pfaff sewing machines are among the best on the market. Pfaff brand has a long tradition of excellence and a vast number of loyal customers. A couple of brands like Singer and Brother are more prominent, but when it comes to quality I would never bet against the Pfaff.</p>

<p>Pfaff Quilt Ambition 2.0 Review The Pfaff Quilt Ambition 2.0 is what I refer to as a ‘passable’ machine, but a far cry from the best. It is, nonetheless, touted as the top of the Pfaff Ambition line. It comes with 201 on board decorative and utility stitches and lots of other features.</p>
<h2 id=do-they-still-make-pfaff-sewing-machines>Do they still make Pfaff sewing machines?</h2>
<h2 id=are-pfaff-sewing-machines-expensive>Are Pfaff sewing machines expensive?</h2>
<p>Pfaff machines are not cheap by any means, but it is so partially because they don’t produce many low-end models of sewing machines. The other part is due to the fact that Pfaff machines are premium quality, durable and reliable. Pfaff is also famous for its innovations.</p>
<h2 id=are-pfaff-and-viking-the-same>Are Pfaff and Viking the same?</h2>
<p>Thats because Husqvarna Viking and Pfaff are owned by the same company, and share designs and secrets between each other. Pfaff was founded in 1862 just ten years before Husqvarna had started making sewing machines.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-sewing-machine-made-by-pfaff>When was the first sewing machine made by Pfaff?</h2>
<p>In 1872, ten years after the company was founded, a thousand sewing machines had been manufactured. In 1902 Pfaff opened a new factory in Kaiserslautern, Germany and the production rate increased significantly, in 1910 Pfaff proudly produced their first million sewing machines.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-pfaff-sewing-machine-sold-to-husqvarna-viking>When was Pfaff sewing machine sold to Husqvarna Viking?</h2>
<p>The founder’s son took over in 1993 and in 1999 was sold to Husqvarna Viking. This sale and other negative business issues were the results of taking Pfaff public and selling shares around 1960. Husqvarna Viking then sold Pfaff in 2006 to Kohlberg & company.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-gritzner-kayser-make-the-pfaff-130>When did Gritzner Kayser make the Pfaff 130?</h2>
<p>The year 1932 saw yet another milestone, launching the famous Pfaff 130, a high-performance zigzag machine to meet the ever-increasing demands on the market. After the Second World War the company continued to expand taking over the Gritzner-Kayser brand in 1957.</p>
