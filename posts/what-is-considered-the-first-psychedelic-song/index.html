<h2 id=what-is-considered-the-first-psychedelic-song>What is considered the first psychedelic song?</h2>
<p>One of the first musical uses of the term “psychedelic” in the folk scene was by the New York-based folk group The Holy Modal Rounders on their version of Lead Belly’s ‘Hesitation Blues’ in 1964.</p>
<h2 id=who-started-psychedelic-music>Who started psychedelic music?</h2>
<p>From England, two former guitarists with the Yardbirds, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, moved on to form key acts in the genre, The Jeff Beck Group and Led Zeppelin respectively. Other major pioneers of the genre had begun as blues-based psychedelic bands, including Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Judas Priest and UFO.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-psychedelic-record>What was the first psychedelic record?</h2>
<p>The 13th Floor Elevators<br>
The first album to define its own contents as psychedelic was the debut album by Texas garage rockers The 13th Floor Elevators, in October 1966 (The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators).</p>
<h2 id=did-the-beatles-invent-psychedelic-rock>Did the Beatles invent psychedelic rock?</h2>
<p>No. They were great practitioners of it, and some of their stuff was extremely high quality but it was never a focus of what they did. For me, psychedelic music came out of San Francisco in 1965–1969–1970.</p>
<h2 id=is-pink-floyd-psychedelic-rock>Is Pink Floyd psychedelic rock?</h2>
<p>By the spring of 1967, Pink Floyd was at the forefront of the psychedelic rock movement that was pushing its way into mainstream popular culture.</p>
<h2 id=is-cream-a-psychedelic>Is cream a psychedelic?</h2>
<p>Cream were a British rock band formed in London in 1966. Their music spanned many genres of rock music, including blues rock (“Crossroads”, “Born Under a Bad Sign”), psychedelic rock (“Tales of Brave Ulysses”, “White Room”), and hard rock (“Sunshine of Your Love”, “SWLABR”).</p>
<h2 id=is-led-zeppelin-a-psychedelic>Is Led Zeppelin a psychedelic?</h2>
<p>They are certainly a psychedelic rock band in that they are a rock band whose music was clearly inspired by psychedelic experiences. In fact, the founders of Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page and Chris Dreja, were members of one of the first psychedelic rock bands, the Yardbirds.</p>
<h2 id=which-beatles-album-is-most-psychedelic>Which Beatles album is most psychedelic?</h2>
<p>Revolver, Sgt Pepper and MMT definitely are their most psychedelic.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-pink-floyd-fans-called>What are Pink Floyd fans called?</h2>
<p>Us (as in “Us and Them”) Crazy Diamonds. Animals (Pigs, Dogs and Sheep) Bricks in the Wall.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-eric-clapton-leave-cream>Why did Eric Clapton leave cream?</h2>
<p>Goodbye and break-up (1968–1969) From its creation, Cream was faced with some fundamental problems that would later lead to its dissolution in November 1968. The antagonism between Bruce and Baker created tensions in the band. Clapton also felt that the members of the band did not listen to each other enough.</p>
<h2 id=who-gave-heavy-metal-its-name>Who gave heavy metal its name?</h2>
<p>novelist William Burroughs<br>
Although the origin of the term heavy metal is widely attributed to novelist William Burroughs, its use actually dates well back into the 19th century, when it referred to cannon or to power more generally. It also has been used to classify certain elements or compounds, as in the phrase heavy metal poisoning.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-most-popular-psychedelic-songs>What are some of the most popular psychedelic songs?</h2>
<p>The top 100 psychedelic songs. 6. “White Room” by Cream, from “Wheels of Fire” (1968) 9. “Eight Miles High” by the Byrds, from “Fifth Dimension” (1966) 10. “Happenings Ten Years Time Ago” by the Yardbirds, single (1966) 12. “Fire” by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown from “The Crazy World of Arthur Brown” (1968)</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-band-to-play-psychedelic-music>Who was the first band to play psychedelic music?</h2>
<p>Building on the funk sound of James Brown, it was pioneered by Sly and the Family Stone with songs like ” Dance to the Music ” (1968), ” Everyday People ” (1968) and ” I Want to Take You Higher ” (1969) and The Temptations with “Cloud Nine”, ” Runaway Child, Running Wild ” (1969) and ” Psychedelic Shack ” (1969).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-psychedelic-record-ever-made>What was the first psychedelic record ever made?</h2>
<p>His 1963 album Fantasias for Guitar and Banjo explores various styles and “could also be accurately described as one of the very first psychedelic records”.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-psychedelic-song-by-the-grateful-dead>What was the first psychedelic song by the Grateful Dead?</h2>
<p>Not sure about the first, but the Grateful Dead were the house band of the Acid Tests in the 1960s, and it greatly formed their sound and improvisational style. My personal first psychedelic song was Dark Star from the album Live Dead.</p>
