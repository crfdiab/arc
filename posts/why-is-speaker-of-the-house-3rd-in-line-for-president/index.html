<h2 id=why-is-speaker-of-the-house-3rd-in-line-for-president>Why is Speaker of the House 3rd in line for president?</h2>
<p>A 1947 law changed the order of succession to place the Speaker of the House in line after the vice president, followed by the president pro tempore, and then the secretary of state and other cabinet officers in order of their departments’ creation. This is the system in effect today.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-speaker-of-the-house-third-in-line-to-be-president>Is the Speaker of the House third in line to be president?</h2>
<p>The Speaker of the House is by law second in line to succeed the President, after the Vice President, and 25th Amendment makes the Speaker a part of the process announcing presidential disability.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-speaker-of-the-house-become-president-if-no-president-is-chosen>Does the Speaker of the House become president if no president is chosen?</h2>
<p>Under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, the Speaker of the House would become acting president until either the House selects a president or the Senate selects a vice president.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-speaker-of-the-house-2nd-in-line-for-the-presidency>Why is the Speaker of the House 2nd in line for the presidency?</h2>
<p>The 1792 act was intended to formalize how that would work and listed the President Pro Tempore followed by the Speaker. The Speaker of the House is 2nd in line for the Presidency; the Vice President is first in line. The House of Representatives members are directly elected; it is The People’s House. As is the President.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-2nd-in-line-for-the-presidency>Who is 2nd in line for the presidency?</h2>
<p>The Speaker of the House is 2nd in line for the Presidency; the Vice President is first in line. The House of Representatives members are directly elected; it is The People’s House. As is the President. Senators were originally elected by the leaders in the Statehouses, so not by direct election.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-the-speaker-of-the-house-is-not-born-in-the-us>What happens if the Speaker of the House is not born in the US?</h2>
<p>Under this interpretation, what is the likely outcome if the President and Vice President are unable to serve, and the third in line of succession, the Speaker of the House, was not born in the U.S.? Presumably, the Speaker would be skipped over.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-speaker-of-the-house-become-president>Can a Speaker of the House become president?</h2>
<p>A Speaker born in France, who’s father is German and mother is American, can become president. Both Senator John McCain, who was born in Panama, and Senator Ted Cruz, who was born in Canada, ran for president under the “citizen at birth” interpretation of “natural born”.</p>
