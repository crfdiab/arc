<h2 id=how-cold-is-it-in-antarctica-in-the-winter>How cold is it in Antarctica in the winter?</h2>
<p>Interesting facts About Antarctica The coldest temperature recorded in Antarctica was -89.6°C at Vostok station in 1983. The average winter temperature at the South Pole is about -49°C. Your home freezer is only about -15°C. The wind chill factor means that it can feel much colder.</p>
<h2 id=is-antarctica-summer-or-winter>Is Antarctica summer or winter?</h2>
<p>Antarctica has just two seasons: summer and winter. Antarctica has six months of daylight in its summer and six months of darkness in its winter. The seasons are caused by the tilt of Earth’s axis in relation to the sun. The direction of the tilt never changes.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-moisture-in-antarctica>Is there moisture in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>The relative humidity of air at the South Pole is often as low as 0.03%, and the continent is a polar desert. This may at first seem surprising with 99% of its area being covered by ice; and Antarctica certainly doesn’t conform to the image that most people have of a desert.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-weather-in-antarctica-during-the-winter>How is the weather in Antarctica during the winter?</h2>
<p>Sun warms up lower layers of the atmosphere and katabatic winds are calming down allowing warmer air from above the ocean to travel inland. Winter comes to Antarctica at Match and lasts to October. This is the time of strong katabatic winds and polar night. Averages in central regions are between -57 and -66 °C (-71…-81 °F).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-it-like-to-live-in-antarctica>What is it like to live in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Darkness comes rapidly at the beginning of an Antarctic winter and then it stays, and it stays and feels like it just won’t go away! It’s not all doom and gloom though, while the days are spent stumbling around in constant twilight, the dark nights are broken up with stunning auroras. An Antarctic winter is no holiday destination.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-seasons-does-antarctica-have-in-a-year>How many seasons does Antarctica have in a year?</h2>
<p>Antarctica only has two seasons: summer and winter. Because it’s located in the southern hemisphere, Antarctica’s summer is from October to February. During this time, the sun is almost always in the sky.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-sun-set-in-antarctica-in-the-summer>When does the sun set in Antarctica in the summer?</h2>
<p>Antarctica only has two seasons: summer and winter. Because it’s located in the southern hemisphere, Antarctica’s summer is from October to February. During this time, the sun is almost always in the sky. Days rapidly get longer there in summer, until, eventually, the sun doesn’t set at all. This phenomenon is called the Midnight Sun.</p>
