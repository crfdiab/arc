<h2 id=what-is-greek-called-now>What is Greek called now?</h2>
<p>Hellenes. The civilization and people of what is known in English as Greece have never referred to themselves as “Greek.” In fact, they refer to themselves as Hellenes, and the region Hellas, as they have since their literary history was first established.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-other-name-for-greece>What is the other name for Greece?</h2>
<p>It turns out that both “Greece” and “Hellas” have Greek roots, but “Greece” was adopted by the Romans (as the Latin word “Graecus”), and later adopted into English, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.</p>
<h2 id=who-gave-greece-its-name>Who gave Greece its name?</h2>
<p>Greece (Greeks) comes from the latin word Graecus which in turn comes from the greek word Γραικός. The name of a tribe from Boeotia which immigrated to Italy in the 8th century BC (BCE). The name then was used for all people living on the other side of the sea.</p>
<h2 id=do-turks-call-greeks-romans>Do Turks call Greeks Romans?</h2>
<p>The citizens, including the Greek ones, of the Eastern Roman Empire even called their language ‘Romeika, Greek: Ρωμαίικα’. Turks call the Greeks in Asia Minor Rum. Sure, the Greeks in the area part of the Eastern Roman Empire called themselves ‘Roman’ at the time as citizens.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-for-greece-in-greek>What is the name for Greece in Greek?</h2>
<p>The name of Greece differs in Greek compared with the names used for the country in other languages and cultures, just like the names of the Greeks. The ancient and modern name of the country is Hellas or most common Hellada (Greek: Ελλάς, Ελλάδα), and its official name is the Hellenic Republic “Helliniki Dimokratia”.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-greece-called-yunan>Why is Greece called Yunan?</h2>
<p>In Homer, the Hellenes themselves are only one Greek tribe; in later usage, so were the Achaeans. It is likely that the Hittites used a variant of Achaeans, Ahhiyawa, to refer to Greeks. * The Persians were first in contact with the Ionian Greeks, so they called Greeks Yunan.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-arabs-call-the-romans>What did the Arabs call the Romans?</h2>
<p>Rûm<br>
Thus, during the Middle Ages the Arabs called the native inhabitants of what is now Turkey, the Balkans, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine “Rûm” (Romans), and called what is now Turkey and the Balkans “the land of the Rûm,” while referring to the Mediterranean as “the Sea of the Rûm”.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-smyrna-called-today>What is Smyrna called today?</h2>

<p>From its establishment after the outbreak of the Greek War of Liberation in 1821, the modern Greek state has used a variety of official names, most often designating changes of regime. Internally, the country was called Hellas, not Greece, even in the cases below where the name was translated internationally as Greece.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-second-greek-republic>What was the name of the second Greek Republic?</h2>
<p>1924–35: ” Hellenic Republic ” (Ἑλληνική Δημοκρατία), known historiographically as the Second Hellenic Republic, from 1924 until the 10 October 1935 coup by Georgios Kondylis and the restoration of the monarchy.</p>
