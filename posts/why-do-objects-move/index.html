<h2 id=why-do-objects-move>Why do objects move?</h2>
<p>Forces and Motion – What makes objects move the way they do? changed by pushing or pulling. The size of the change in an object’s motion is related to the strength of the push or pull. The more massive an object is, the less effect a given force will have on its motion.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-things-move-around-us>How do things move around us?</h2>
<p>The world around us is in motion, full of living and nonliving things that move in ways that can be predicted and described. Pushing, pulling, friction, and gravity are forces that affect objects at rest and in motion.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-three-ways-things-can-move>What are three ways things can move?</h2>
<p>There are three basic ways objects (as opposed to atoms or subatomic particles)can move: translation, rotation and dilation. There are many variations of each, and combinations of two or more of these basic movements.</p>
<h2 id=which-among-the-object-is-the-hardest-to-move>Which among the object is the hardest to move?</h2>
<p>Answer: The greater the weight (or mass) of an object, the more inertia it has. Heavy objects are harder to move than light ones because they have more inertia.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-two-objects-collide>What happens when two objects collide?</h2>
<p>In a collision between two objects, both objects experience forces that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Such forces often cause one object to speed up (gain momentum) and the other object to slow down (lose momentum).</p>
<h2 id=does-it-take-a-stronger-force-to-slow-something-down-or-speed-it-up>Does it take a stronger force to slow something down or speed it up?</h2>
<p>For example if a ball is hit harder, it will speed up faster. If an object must be slowed down quickly, the force applied to the object must be greater than what is needed for a gradual slowing down. For example, the greater the force applied to the brakes of a bicycle, the more quickly it will slow down or stop.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-push-and-pull>What can you push and pull?</h2>
<p>Push and pull are the forces that are used to put an object into motion….Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Thumb Pins.</li>
<li>Opening and Closing a Door.</li>
<li>Pushing a Car.</li>
<li>Pulling a Cart.</li>
<li>Inserting and Removing a Plug.</li>
<li>Water Dispensers.</li>
<li>Pulling Curtains and Blinds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-do-you-know-an-object-is-moving>How do you know an object is moving?</h2>
<ol>
<li>An object is moving if its position relative to a fixed point is changing.</li>
<li>You can calculate the speed of an object by dividing the distance covered by time.</li>
<li>Speed is a description of how fast an object moves; velocity is how fast and in what direction it moves.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-else-can-make-things-move>What else can make things move?</h2>
<p>Force can make things move, change shape or change their speed. Some forces are direct and happen when two things touch (like a foot kicking a ball) or over a distance (such as a magnet or gravity). Friction is the force between two objects in contact with each other that will resist an attempt to move them.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-harder-to-get-something-moving-than-to-keep-it-moving>Why is it harder to get something moving than to keep it moving?</h2>
<p>For an object at rest on a flat table, static friction is zero. If you push horizontally with a small force, static friction establishes an equal and opposite force that keeps the book at rest. It is harder to move a stationary object than it is to keep a moving object in motion. …</p>
<h2 id=why-do-you-think-it-is-the-easiest-to-move>Why do you think it is the easiest to move?</h2>
<p>When two flat surfaces are sliding past each other, there will in general be friction. Breaking this bond to set the surfaces in motion, i.e. overcoming the coefficient of static friction, takes more force than just keeping the object in motion.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-know-how-things-move>Why is it important to know how things move?</h2>
<p>This unit explains these forces, and it describes the movement of objects, including how forces can move things, stop them, and change their speed and direction. Knowing how and why things move allows us to work, play, get around, and complete everyday tasks.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-forces-that-cause-things-to-move>What are the forces that cause things to move?</h2>
<p>Pushing, pulling, friction, and gravity are forces that affect objects at rest and in motion. This unit explains these forces, and it describes the movement of objects, including how forces can move things, stop them, and change their speed and direction.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-things-in-the-world-in-motion>How are things in the world in motion?</h2>
<p>Things Move. The world around us is in motion, full of living and nonliving things that move in ways that can be predicted and described. Pushing, pulling, friction, and gravity are forces that affect objects at rest and in motion.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-some-things-move-faster-than-others>Why do some things move faster than others?</h2>
<p>It shows that the greater the value of M, the greater the force required to produce a given acceleration. Or, put more simply, large masses are just more reluctant to respond to forces. If that force is gravity, however, Newton showed that the greater the mass, the stronger the gravitational force it feels.</p>
