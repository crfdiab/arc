<h2 id=is-it-expensive-to-travel-by-train-in-japan>Is it expensive to travel by train in Japan?</h2>
<p>Train fares in Japan are very expensive, with no cheap advance-purchase fares just one hefty fixed price for each journey. Even if you are only planning one round trip, a Japan Rail Pass may well save you money over point-to-point tickets. For example, a 7-day Japan Rail Pass costs ¥29,110 = £215 or $268.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-the-bullet-train-from-tokyo-to-kyoto>How much is the bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto?</h2>
<p>Nozomi trains require about 140 minutes to reach Kyoto from Tokyo, Hikari trains about 160 minutes and Kodama trains about four hours. The regular one way fare from Tokyo to Kyoto is 13,320 yen for a non-reserved seat or around 14,000 yen for a reserved seat.</p>
<h2 id=does-jr-pass-cover-bullet-train>Does JR pass cover bullet train?</h2>
<p>The PASS is valid on all Japan Railways (JR) Group Shinkansen “bullet trains” (except for the “NOZOMI” and “MIZUHO” trains), limited express trains, express trains, and local trains (Green Car passes are valid for Green Car travel) in addition to the BRT (Bus Rapid Transit system).</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-travel-japan-by-train>How long does it take to travel Japan by train?</h2>
<p>With a top speed of 320 kilometres (199 miles) per hour, Japan’s bullet train – the Shinkansen – takes just under 12 hours to complete its 1,941-kilometre (1,206-mile) journey from Aomori in the north to Kagoshima in the south.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-buy-train-tickets-in-tokyo>How do I buy train tickets in Tokyo?</h2>
<p>Tickets are sold at ticket vending machines found at every Tokyo Metro station. Tickets are available in denominations of 170 yen, 200 yen, 250 yen, 290 yen, and 320 yen. Select the fare based on the distance you will travel. Fares depend on the distance you will travel.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-price-of-a-bullet-train-ticket-in-japan>What’s the price of a bullet train ticket in Japan?</h2>
<p>Your rail options are 1) an individual shinkansen ticket at ¥14,170 OR 2) a JR Pass—which provides 7 days of unlimited travel, even on some shinkansen trains—at ¥29,650 . Which do you choose? √ Answer 1: The obvious choice for your Tokyo–Kyoto trip is the one-way shinkansen ticket, saving you more than half of the JR Pass price tag.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-a-shinkansen-ticket>How much does it cost to get a shinkansen ticket?</h2>
<p>This is a supplement fee which has to be paid in addition to the base fare, if you use shinkansen (bullet trains) or tokkyu (limited express trains). The limited express fee depends on the distance traveled and on the train. Limited express fees for shinkansen range from around 800 yen for short distances to around 11,000 yen for long distances.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-bullet-train-from-kyoto-to-tokyo>How long is the bullet train from Kyoto to Tokyo?</h2>
<p>Another being that you value your time more than money, and would rather spend said time doing than traveling. The bullet train is convenience bliss: Tokyo to Kyoto in three hours or less. Compare that to an 8-hour bus ride or an all-day local train ride riddled with cumbersome transfers. (Plus all the leg room you get is bananas!)</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-night-train-ticket-in-japan>How much is a night train ticket in Japan?</h2>
<p>Seat reservations can be made, starting one month in advance of the departure date. This is a supplement fee which has to be paid, if you use a berth or private compartment on a night train. There are several categories of berths and compartments, ranging in cost from around 6,600 to around 14,000 yen.</p>
