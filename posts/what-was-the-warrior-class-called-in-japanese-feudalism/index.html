<p>Samurai<br>
Samurai, member of the Japanese warrior caste. The term samurai was originally used to denote the aristocratic warriors (bushi), but it came to apply to all the members of the warrior class that rose to power in the 12th century and dominated the Japanese government until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-feudal-class-system-in-japan>What was the feudal class system in Japan?</h2>
<p>Feudal Japanese society was essentially divided into four different castes. The Nobles (the Emperor, Shogun and Daimyos) held the greatest status and influence. The Samurai were below the nobles, and the second most powerful caste, having significant influence and rights within society.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-four-main-classes-in-japans-feudal-system>What were the four main classes in Japan’s feudal system?</h2>

<p>While reports suggest a Matrix reboot might happen, there has been almost nothing heard about a Ninja Assassin 2. Without the Wachowskis pushing for a sequel it seems very unlikely it will happen now.</p>

<p>Samurai: The warrior class of feudal Japan Posted on September 19, 2017 The Samurai, the warrior class of ancient Japan, dominated that country’s political and social structure for centuries. The Samurai came into existence in the early thirteenth century with the establishment of a feudal society in Japan.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-four-tiered-class-system-end-in-japan>When did the four tiered class system end in Japan?</h2>
<p>The End of the Four-Tiered System. In 1868, the “Floating World” came to an end, as a number of radical shocks completely remade Japanese society. The emperor retook power in his own right, as part of the Meiji Restoration, and abolished the office of the shogun.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-class-below-the-emperor-in-japan>Who was the class below the emperor in Japan?</h2>
<p>The class below the emperor was the shogun, which was a part of the warrior division of classes in Japan. Although the shogun wasn’t technically the official leader, they held more power than the emperor and served as the true mastermind behind the emperor’s actions.</p>
