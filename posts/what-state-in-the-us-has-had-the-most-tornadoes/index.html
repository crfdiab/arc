<h2 id=what-state-in-the-us-has-had-the-most-tornadoes>What state in the US has had the most tornadoes?</h2>
<p>Texas<br>
Texas had the most tornadoes in 2019, reporting 188 tornadoes.</p>
<h2 id=does-texas-have-more-tornadoes-than-any-other-state>Does Texas have more tornadoes than any other state?</h2>
<p>More tornadoes have been recorded in Texas than in any other state, which is partly due to the state’s size. Between 1951 and 2011, 8,007 funnel clouds reached the ground, thus becoming tornadoes. The greatest number of tornadoes in Texas in a single year is 232, also in 1967.</p>
<h2 id=does-oklahoma-or-kansas-have-more-tornadoes>Does Oklahoma or Kansas have more tornadoes?</h2>
<p>Kansas and Oklahoma ranked first and second respectively in the number of tornadoes per area, per data collected through 2007, however in 2013 statistics from the National Climatic Data Center show Florida ranked first.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-most-tornados-in-the-united-states>Where are the Most tornados in the United States?</h2>
<p>The state is located at the heartlands of what scientists call Tornado Alley. The state averages 47 tornadoes in a year with most of them being category F3 and above. The worst storm to ever hit the state was the Udall tornado in 1955 that destroyed an entire town, killing 80 people and injuring 200.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-tornado-free-states-in-the-united-states>Are there any tornado free states in the United States?</h2>
<p>Every state in America experiences tornadoes. However, generally, most states west of the Rockies are typically free of the more violent tornadoes that plague much of the United States. Besides that, pretty much all of the country minus the farthest Northeastern States receieve tornadoes. The term Tornado Alley is quite misleading.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-states-that-are-in-tornado-alley>Are there any states that are in Tornado Alley?</h2>
<p>Though there is no definitive border to Tornado Alley, its core dominates the states of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and part of northern Texas, but high numbers of tornadoes can occur even in areas like Colorado, the Dakotas, and Florida.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-tornado-in-the-united-states>When was the last tornado in the United States?</h2>
<p>In 1947 the state was hit by another F5 storm that resulted in 185 fatalities, the tornado spanned across three states from Kansas to Texas as it passed through Woodward, a small town in Oklahoma.</p>
