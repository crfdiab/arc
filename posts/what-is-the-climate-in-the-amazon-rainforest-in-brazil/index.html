<h2 id=what-is-the-climate-in-the-amazon-rainforest-in-brazil>What is the climate in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil?</h2>
<p>In a large area of northern Brazil, covered by the Amazon rainforest, the climate is equatorial, hot and humid throughout the year, with constant rainfall. Within the forest, the temperature remains below 30 °C (86 °F) even during the day, but relative humidity is consistently close to 100%.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-rainforest-like-in-brazil>What is the rainforest like in Brazil?</h2>
<p>The Amazon Rainforest stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the tree line of the Andes in the west. The forest widens from a 200-mile (320-km) front along the Atlantic to a belt 1,200 miles (1,900 km) wide at the Andean foothills. Brazil holds approximately 60 percent of the Amazon within its borders.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-brazilian-rainforest-the-same-as-the-amazon>Is the Brazilian rainforest the same as the Amazon?</h2>
<p>The Amazon rainforest is the world’s largest intact forest. While it covers 2.6 million square miles across nine countries — Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana — about 60 percent of the Amazon Basin is in Brazil, where Greenpeace has focused its efforts.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-weather-like-in-the-amazon-rainforest>What’s the weather like in the Amazon rainforest?</h2>
<p>* The Amazon Rainforest is a tropical rainforest and is located very close to the Equator. * As a result of being a tropical rainforest, the Amazon’s weather and climate is very hot, humid and damp. * Its average temperature is 27 degrees. * There is no seasons like Summer, Autumn,…</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-amazon-rainforest-located-in-the-world>Where is the Amazon rainforest located in the world?</h2>
<p>The Amazon rainforest occupies territories in nine South American countries including Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and Peru. This region features the largest river in the world by volume as well as some of the highest levels of biodiversity on the planet.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-amazon-rainforest-important-to-europe>Why is the Amazon rainforest important to Europe?</h2>
<p>A substantial part of the Amazon rainforest economy comes from illegal activities, like drug dealing, biological trade and wood cutting. Most drugs that reach Europe and United States are not farmed in the region, but Amazon rainforest serves as a path to drug dealers to deliver their production.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-worst-activity-in-the-amazon-rainforest>Which is the worst activity in the Amazon rainforest?</h2>
<p>Biological trade, also illegal, is one of the worst activities in the Amazon rainforest because it exploits the wild life, usually threatening the most endangered species. Wood cutting is a major economic sector in the Amazon rainforest.</p>
