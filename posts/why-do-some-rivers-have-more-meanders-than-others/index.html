<h2 id=why-do-some-rivers-have-more-meanders-than-others>Why do some rivers have more meanders than others?</h2>
<p>The river erodes soil from the outer curve and deposits on the inner curve. This causes the meanders to grow larger and larger over time. The bend gets more and more pronounced with time.</p>
<h2 id=how-the-course-of-a-river-has-altered-is-called>How the course of a river has altered is called?</h2>
<p>In its youthful stage the river causes erosion in the water-course, deepening the valley. Hydraulic action loosens and dislodges the rock which further erodes the banks and the river bed. Over time, this deepens the river bed and creates steeper sides which are then weathered.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-one-way-a-river-can-change-land-because-of-a-flood>What is one way a river can change land because of a flood?</h2>
<p>Water that flows across the land runs downhill. Along the way, it can pick up and carry sediment ranging from fine clay to coarse sand or gravel. As the water runs downhill, it cuts into the soil, forming channels called gullies. Fast-moving or large streams can carry more sediment than slow-moving or small streams.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-a-river-meander-in-its-course>Why does a river meander in its course?</h2>
<p>The rivers meander due to low gradient and discharge of water. On plain areas rivers tend to take the easiest way, the routes least resistant. The places that are easier cut or eroded will be the path the river takes.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-course-of-the-mississippi-river-changes>What happens when the course of the Mississippi River changes?</h2>
<p>This change in energy results in an area of erosion and an area of deposition in each meander. Along the outside of the meander, where the water is moving at a higher velocity, the banks of the riverbed are being cut away.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-a-river-change-its-course-in-a-flood-plain>Why does a river change its course in a flood plain?</h2>
<p>This is because in the lower course there are no fixed banks as it flows through a flood plain where the soil is too soft. The river carries a huge amount of sediment that begins depositing due to the slow speed as a result of low gradient of land.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-meandering-rivers-in-the-world>Are there any meandering rivers in the world?</h2>
<p>Meanders are present even in oceans as formed by the well known Atlantic Gulf Stream, while passing along the coast of Florida towards north, alongside New England and then east ward to Europe. Meanders form even when there are no banks; as exemplified by the flow from a small nozzle on a slightly inclined glass plate.</p>
