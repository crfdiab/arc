<h2 id=why-were-people-mad-about-the-kansas-nebraska-act>Why were people mad about the Kansas-Nebraska Act?</h2>
<p>People were angry about the Kansas-Nebraska Act because it was a de facto repeal of the 1820 Missouri Compromise. In 1820, the abolitionist movement compromised with pro-slavery advocates for the gradual abolition of slavery by containing it to the south.</p>
<h2 id=what-states-were-affected-by-the-kansas-nebraska-act>What states were affected by the Kansas-Nebraska Act?</h2>
<p>Ostensibly a bill “to organize the Territory of Nebraska,” an area covering the present-day states of Kansas, Nebraska, Montana, and the Dakotas, contemporaries called it “the Nebraska bill.” Today, we know it as the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854.</p>
<h2 id=which-controversial-concept-was-the-foundation-of-the-kansas-nebraska-act>Which controversial concept was the foundation of the Kansas-Nebraska Act?</h2>
<p>The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed each territory to decide the issue of slavery on the basis of popular sovereignty. Kansas with slavery would violate the Missouri Compromise, which had kept the Union from falling apart for the last thirty-four years.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-kansas-nebraska-act>What was the result of the Kansas Nebraska Act?</h2>
<p>The Kansas-Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise, created two new territories, and allowed for popular sovereignty. It also produced a violent uprising known as “Bleeding Kansas,” as proslavery and antislavery activists flooded into the territories to sway the vote.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-author-of-the-kansas-nebraska-bill>Who was the author of the Kansas Nebraska Bill?</h2>
<p>Illinois Democratic senator Stephen Douglas believed he had found a solution—the Kansas-Nebraska bill —that would promote party unity and also satisfy his colleagues from the South, who detested the Missouri Compromise line. In January 1854, Douglas introduced the bill.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-nebraska-bill>What was the purpose of the Nebraska Bill?</h2>
<p>In 1854 Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois presented a bill destined to be one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in our national history. Ostensibly a bill “to organize the Territory of Nebraska,” an area covering the present-day states of Kansas, Nebraska, Montana, and the Dakotas, contemporaries called it “the Nebraska bill.”</p>
<h2 id=why-did-douglas-want-to-create-kansas-and-nebraska>Why did Douglas want to create Kansas and Nebraska?</h2>
<p>To gain the southerners’ support, Douglas proposed creating two territories in the area– Kansas and Nebraska–and repealing the Missouri Compromise line. The question of whether the territories would be slave or free would be left to the settlers under Douglas’s principle of popular sovereignty.</p>
