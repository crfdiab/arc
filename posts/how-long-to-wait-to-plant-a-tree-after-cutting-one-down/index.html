<h2 id=how-long-to-wait-to-plant-a-tree-after-cutting-one-down>How long to wait to plant a tree after cutting one down?</h2>
<p>The tree that was removed will most likely still have roots in the soil, and these roots will slowly but surely decompose, but it’s not an overnight process. Ideally, one should wait about a year before planting a new tree in the same spot a tree was removed from.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-plant-a-tree-when-you-cut-one-down>Do you have to plant a tree when you cut one down?</h2>
<p>While it is certainly possible to replant in the same spot after tree removal, doing so isn’t ideal. Certified arborists usually recommend choosing a new planting site for these reasons: The soil may be stripped of nutrients essential to the growth of a sapling.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-plant-new-trees-after-cutting-one-down>Why is it important to plant new trees after cutting one down?</h2>
<p>Removing one older tree often allows several smaller, younger ones to flourish. Younger trees also absorb more nitrogen than older trees, which helps clean an ecosystem’s air and water. Cutting down older trees also creates room for planting new saplings.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-plant-tree-seedlings>How do you plant tree seedlings?</h2>
<p>The seedling should be planted with the root collar just below the soil surface. The roots need to be straight within the hole, not twisted or bent (J-rooted). The soil should be firmly packed around the seedling to avoid air pockets, which can cause the roots to dry out and thus kill the seedling.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-move-a-tree-without-killing-it>How do you move a tree without killing it?</h2>
<p>Tie the branches to the main tree trunk so they don’t get in your way when you move the tree; do this just before moving the tree, says This Old House. You can use soft twine to wrap individual branches or wrap the entire tree in soft netting, a material commonly used to bundle evergreens before transport.</p>
<h2 id=should-i-remove-old-roots-before-planting>Should I remove old roots before planting?</h2>
<p>In the case of soil in potted plants, the soil will not have such luxury as having additional bacteria and other beneficial insects to remove the old roots. You should remove the old roots from potting soil as this can definitely become an issue when new plants are planted in the same limited space as the old plant.</p>
<h2 id=what-will-be-the-result-if-trees-are-not-taken-care-of>What will be the result if trees are not taken care of?</h2>
<p>Life could not exist on Earth without trees because they produce most of the oxygen that humans and wildlife breathe. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen using the process of photosynthesis. Additionally, trees provide a supply of lumber, seeds, and fruit.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-know-that-the-seedlings-are-ready-to-plant>How do you know that the seedlings are ready to plant?</h2>
<p>The general rule of thumb is that when a seedling has three to four true leaves, it’s large enough to plant out in the garden (after it has been hardened off). When you plant a seed, the first leaves to emerge are the cotyledons. These leaves will look different from leaves that will grow later.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-should-you-water-tree-seedlings>How often should you water tree seedlings?</h2>
<p>Newly planted trees or shrubs require more frequent watering than established trees and shrubs. They should be watered at planting time and at these intervals: 1-2 weeks after planting, water daily. 3-12 weeks after planting, water every 2 to 3 days.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-cut-down-an-old-tree-and-plant-a-new-one>What happens if you cut down an old tree and plant a new one?</h2>
<p>The sawdust left behind from the removal or stump grinding could also change the soil’s nutrient balance. If any of the old tree’s roots are still there, your young tree may not have enough room to grow. If an old tree was removed because of a disease, that pathogen could still be lingering in the soil.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-if-you-cut-down-a-tree-in-your-yard>What to do if you cut down a tree in your yard?</h2>
<p>That could mean using a pickaxe to chop out all the old roots so the new tree has plenty of root room to establish itself. If there is still a stump in your yard, you can encourage it to decompose.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-plant-a-new-tree-over-a-ground-out-stump>Can you plant a new tree over a ground out stump?</h2>
<p>Can you plant a new tree over a ground out stump? As we mentioned above, you don’t want to plant a new tree in the same spot or over a ground out stump. But you can plant your new tree near an old tree’s stump. Shoot for an area about six to eight feet away from the stump.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-plant-a-tree-seedling>What’s the best way to plant a tree seedling?</h2>
<p>Pack the soil firmly enough around the roots so a vigorous pull is required to loosen the seedling. Plant bare-root seedlings so roots are spread out as much as possible. Avoid unnatural J-shaped bends in the roots. This often occurs when root systems are stuffed into planting holes that are too small.</p>
