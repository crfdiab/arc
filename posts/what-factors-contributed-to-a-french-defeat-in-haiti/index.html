<h2 id=what-factors-contributed-to-a-french-defeat-in-haiti>What factors contributed to a French defeat in Haiti?</h2>
<p>Among the causes of the conflicts were the affranchis’ frustrations with a racist society, turmoil created in the colony by the French Revolution, nationalistic rhetoric expressed during Vodou ceremonies, the continuing brutality of slave owners, and wars between European powers.</p>
<h2 id=what-disease-helped-the-haitians-win-the-rebellion-against-france>What disease helped the Haitians win the rebellion against France?</h2>
<p>yellow fever<br>
The rebels, now led by Dessalines, resumed hostilities against the French. Without a doubt, they were encouraged by the effects of yellow fever on the Europeans.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-haitian-revolution-succeed>How did the Haitian revolution succeed?</h2>
<p>The Haitian Revolution has often been described as the largest and most successful slave rebellion in the Western Hemisphere. Slaves initiated the rebellion in 1791 and by 1803 they had succeeded in ending not just slavery but French control over the colony.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-toussaint-l-ouverture-gain-his-freedom>How did Toussaint L Ouverture gain his freedom?</h2>
<p>Standing steadfastly, he fought to end slavery and gain Haiti’s independence from European powers, France and Spain. Forming an army of former slaves and deserters from the French and Spanish armies, he trained his followers in guerrilla warfare and successfully ended slavery in Hispaniola by 1795.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-haitian-revolution-of-1791>Who was involved in the Haitian Revolution of 1791?</h2>
<p>Haitian Revolution, series of conflicts between 1791 and 1804 between Haitian slaves, colonists, the armies of the British and the French colonizers, and a number of other parties.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-the-affranchis-in-the-haitian-revolution>What was the role of the affranchis in the Haitian Revolution?</h2>
<p>The affranchis, most of them mulattoes, were sometimes slave owners themselves and aspired to the economic and social levels of the Europeans. They feared and spurned the slave majority but were generally discriminated against by the white European colonists, who were merchants, landowners, overseers, craftsmen,…</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-french-surrender-in-the-haitian-revolution>Where did the French surrender in the Haitian Revolution?</h2>
<p>On November 18 the Armée indigène (French: “Indigenous Army”) under Dessalines defeated the French at the Battle of Vertières, and French Gen. Jean-Baptiste-Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, surrendered Cap-Français (now Cap-Haïtien), the last significant French stronghold.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-slaves-die-during-the-haitian-revolution>How did slaves die during the Haitian Revolution?</h2>
<p>Slaves endured long, backbreaking workdays and often died from injuries, infections, and tropical diseases. Malnutrition and starvation also were common. Some slaves managed to escape into the mountainous interior, where they became known as Maroons and fought guerrilla battles against colonial militia.</p>
