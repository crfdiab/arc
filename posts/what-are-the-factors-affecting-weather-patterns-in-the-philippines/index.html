<p>Temperature, humidity, and rainfall, which are discussed hereunder, are the most important elements of the country’s weather and climate.</p>

<p>Which factor affects each of the four types of climate based on rainfall distribution in the Philippines? Prevailing winds.</p>

<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-of-seasons-in-the-philippines>What are the causes of seasons in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>In summary, because the Philippines is in the tropical zone, the seasons are not determined by the amount of daylight. Rather, they are determined by the amount of rainfall, which varies throughout the year and from one part of the country to another because of seasonal variations in the prevailing wind patterns.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-the-philippines-only-have-2-season-types>Why do the Philippines only have 2 season types?</h2>
<p>Why philippines have two seasons? The Philippines is located near the equator. Areas near or at the equator receive high amounts of sunlight due to the inclination of the earth. Because more amount of sunlight is received in these areas, there are only two seasons here: the summer and the rainy season.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-rain-does-the-philippines-get-from-tropical-cyclones>How much rain does the Philippines get from tropical cyclones?</h2>
<p>At least 30 percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines can be traced to tropical cyclones, while the southern islands receiving less than 10 percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-el-nino-in-the-philippines>What are the effects of El Nino in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Excessive rains brought about by strong monsoon activity during these ENSO events have created massive floods and landslides in the urban and rural areas. Notable increases in strong tropical cyclones surrounding the Philippines have generated devastating winds and increased storm surges over coastal areas.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-a-typhoon-hit-the-philippines>How often does a typhoon hit the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Bagyo is the Filipino term for any tropical cyclone in the Philippine Islands. From the statistics gathered by PAGASA from 1948 to 2004, around an average of 28 storms and/or typhoons per year enter the PAR (Philippine Area of Responsibility) – the designated area assigned to PAGASA to monitor during weather disturbances.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-important-source-of-rainfall-in-the-philippines>Which is the most important source of rainfall in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>ENSO is the most important source of interannual variability of rainfall in the Philippines along with many other areas of the world (Ropelewski and Halpert 1987; Allen et al. 1996).</p>
