<h2 id=how-can-we-maintain-balance-between-environment-and-development>How can we maintain balance between environment and development?</h2>
<p>1 Answer</p>
<ol>
<li>The three ways to maintain a balance between environment and development to survive are :</li>
<li>(i) Forest resources should be used in an environmentally and developmentally sound manner.</li>
<li>(ii) Instead of using non-renewable natural resources use of renewable natural resources should be preferred.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-maintain-a-balance-between-nature-and-society>Why is it important to maintain a balance between nature and society?</h2>
<p>Ecological balance is a term used to describe the equilibrium between living organisms such as human being, plants, and animals as well as their environment. Therefore, this balance is very important because it ensures survival, existence and stability of the environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-social-economic-and-environmental-impacts>What is the difference between social economic and environmental impacts?</h2>
<p>Social impacts refer to how a management method will affect people. It will look at how it impacts their houses and where they live, how it will affect their daily lives and their food and water supply. Environmental impacts refer to how management methods will impact the natural environment.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-protect-environment-along-with-the-maintenance-of-sustainable-development>How can we protect environment along with the maintenance of sustainable development?</h2>
<p>Some of the important measures for sustainable development are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>(i) Technology:</li>
<li>(ii) Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle Approach:</li>
<li>(iii) Promoting Environmental Education and Awareness:</li>
<li>(iv) Resource Utilization as Per Carrying Capacity:</li>
<li>(v) Improving Quality of Life Including Social, Cultural and Economic Dimensions:</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=why-are-environmental-regulations-good>Why are environmental regulations Good?</h2>
<p>Environmental regulations have greatly improved air and water quality, especially in areas that were dirtiest before regulation. Reducing airborne particulates is especially beneficial, saving thousands of lives and preventing millions of illnesses each year.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-a-healthy-environment-balance>Why do we need a healthy environment balance?</h2>
<p>Environment balance – things to be done to maintain their natural phenomenan. whatever resources we uses, we have a need to maintain healthy & its natural form (for environment balance) , through that it can sustain life for a long time.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-balance-conservation-and-human-development>How can we balance conservation and Human Development?</h2>
<p>The question of whether we can advance both conservation and human development is the driving force behind a new study by 13 institutions, including The Nature Conservancy and the University of Minnesota. From the outset, we stepped back and reexamined the concept of sustainability from the bottom-line up, so to speak.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-environmental-costs-related-to-environmental-benefits>How are environmental costs related to environmental benefits?</h2>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of such payments could be compared with other tools used to address community resistance to noise (i.e., airport operating restrictions, regulations, the purchase of property in noise-affected communities, zoning land for uses compatible with the level of noise, and NASA research and technology programs).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-impact-of-environment-on-society>What is the impact of Environment on society?</h2>
<p>Awareness and training of the community is considered as very useful for the protection and preservation of environment. A number of movements have been launched in different parts of the country for the protection, preservation and solution of environmental problems.</p>
