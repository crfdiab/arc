<h2 id=what-gifts-were-given-at-a-potlatch>What gifts were given at a potlatch?</h2>
<p>Historically, the potlatch functioned to redistribute wealth in what some refer to as a gift-giving ceremony. Valuable goods, such as firearms, blankets, clothing, carved cedar boxes, canoes, food and prestige items, such as slaves and coppers, were accumulated by high-ranking individuals over time, sometimes years.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-native-americans-give-gifts-at-the-potlatch>Why did Native Americans give gifts at the potlatch?</h2>
<p>Potlatch, ceremonial distribution of property and gifts to affirm or reaffirm social status, as uniquely institutionalized by the American Indians of the Northwest Pacific coast. A potlatch was given by an heir or successor to assert and validate his newly assumed social position.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-meaning-of-the-potlatch-to-the-tlingit>What was the meaning of the potlatch to the Tlingit?</h2>
<p>The word “potlatch” means “to give” from the Chinook jargin on the Columbian River.

<h2 id=what-is-potlatch-feast>What is potlatch feast?</h2>
<p>A Potlatch is an opulent ceremonial feast to celebrate an important event held by tribes of Northwest Indians of North America including the Tlingit, Tsimishian, Haida, Coast Salish and the Chinook and Dene people. The term ‘Potlatch’ has been taken from a Nootka Indian word meaning “gift”.</p>
<h2 id=are-potlatches-still-illegal>Are Potlatches still illegal?</h2>
<p>Integral to the meaning of the potlatch today, especially among the Kwakwaka’wakw and other Coastal First Nations, is the Canadian governments banning of the ceremony through legal means. Potlatching was made illegal in 1885, and the prohibition was not lifted until 1951 (Cole and Chaikin 1990).</p>
<h2 id=who-attends-a-potlatch>Who attends a potlatch?</h2>
<p>A potlatch is a gift-giving feast practiced by Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of Canada and the United States, among whom it is traditionally the primary governmental institution, legislative body, and economic system.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-tlingit-believe-in>What did the Tlingit believe in?</h2>
<p>The Tlingit tribe believed that a creator god,called Kah- shu-goon-yah, made the universe and controls its fundamental features. Raven, a Trickster god, taught the Tlingit people the institutions by which they lived. The jek, or supernatural spirits, are found in almost anything.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-potlatch-and-example>What is potlatch and example?</h2>
<p>A party where there is food, dancing, or any other merriment would be considered a potlatch. In a more general sense, to potlatch can signify giving or holding a feast, wild party, or both! Example: During the potlatch, the chieftain gave a speech to thank all of his guests.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-potlatch-celebrated>How is potlatch celebrated?</h2>
<p>Potlatches often involve music, dancing, singing, storytelling, making speeches, and often joking and games. The word comes from the Chinook Jargon, meaning “to give away” or “a gift”; originally from the Nuu-chah-nulth word paɬaˑč, to make a ceremonial gift in a potlatch.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-canada-ban-potlatches>When did Canada ban Potlatches?</h2>
<p>1885<br>
Integral to the meaning of the potlatch today, especially among the Kwakwaka’wakw and other Coastal First Nations, is the Canadian governments banning of the ceremony through legal means. Potlatching was made illegal in 1885, and the prohibition was not lifted until 1951 (Cole and Chaikin 1990).</p>
<h2 id=is-potlatch-the-same-as-potluck>Is potlatch the same as Potluck?</h2>
<p>The word “Potluck” means exactly what it looks like, the luck of the pot. The word “Potlatch,” comes from an entirely different world. Literally. It is credited to a word in what was known as Chinook Jargon, a patois used by traders in the Northwest States in the early days of European-Native American commerce.</p>
<h2 id=what-religion-is-the-tlingit-tribe>What religion is the Tlingit tribe?</h2>
<p>Between 1886-1895, in the face of their shamans’ inability to treat Old World diseases including smallpox, most of the Tlingit people converted to Orthodox Christianity. After the introduction of Christianity, the Tlingit belief system began to erode.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-potlatch-in-the-haida>What was the purpose of the potlatch in the Haida?</h2>
<p>by dancing, and by song. The Potlatch was the Haida biggest cerebration, it means to give. Unlike the parties that we have; at a Potlatch, the host would give the guests gifts. The richer the family the better the gifts. Potlatch was in ceremony to celebrate marriage or birth or death or “coming of age” birthday.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-haida-people-trade-with-each-other-for>What did the Haida people trade with each other for?</h2>
<p>The Haida traded slaves, shells and their famous canoes for copper, Chilkat blankets, and hides with the Tsimshains. With the Tlingits they traded canoes, seaweed, and dried halibut for eulachons and soapberries. The Haida people had some internal trade within Haida communities that mostly consisted of products of skilled workmanship.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-haida-indians-teach-their-children>How did the Haida Indians teach their children?</h2>
<p>parents teach us. Instead of going to school or being home schooled, the Haida kids would watch their parents dance. The Haida adults would teach their children by stories, by dancing, and by song. The Potlatch was the Haida biggest cerebration, it means to give. Unlike the parties that we have; at a Potlatch, the host would give the guests gifts.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-do-at-a-potlatch-ceremony>What did people do at a potlatch ceremony?</h2>
<p>Unlike the parties that we have; at a Potlatch, the host would give the guests gifts. The richer the family the better the gifts.
