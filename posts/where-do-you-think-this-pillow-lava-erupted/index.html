<h2 id=where-do-you-think-this-pillow-lava-erupted>Where do you think this pillow lava erupted?</h2>
<p>Pillow lava is commonly cited as the most abundant geologic landform on Earth’s surface. As described above, pillows form at low, though imprecisely known, flow rates. Pillow lavas have been observed while forming on the shallow submarine slopes of Hawaii, where subaerial lava flows enter the sea, and on W.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-pillow-basalts-occur>Where do pillow basalts occur?</h2>
<p>mid-ocean ridges<br>
Pillow basalt typically forms at volcanoes at mid-ocean ridges or at oceanic hot-spot volcanoes, such as those that formed the Hawaiian Islands. Basalt forms the crust of all the ocean basins and is therefore the most common rock in the Earth’s crust.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-pillow-lava-found>Where are pillow lava found?</h2>
<p>They occur wherever lava is extruded underwater, such as along marine hotspot volcano chains and the constructive plate boundaries of mid-ocean ridges. As new oceanic crust is formed, thick sequences of pillow lavas are erupted at the spreading center fed by dykes from the underlying magma chamber.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-pillow-lava-evidence-of>What is pillow lava evidence of?</h2>
<p>Molten material becomes the new sea floor, when it erupts from the mantle as pillow lava, and creates new oceanic crust. How is the age of the seafloor evidence for seafloor spreading? The younger rocks are in the middle at the ridge. Magma moves up from the mantle and erupts as pillow lava.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-pillow-basalts-different-from-other-types-of-lava>How are pillow basalts different from other types of lava?</h2>
<p>On the other hand, ‘a’a cools so quickly that the flow is literally breaking apart as it’s rapidly cooling and moving. Pillow basalts are the basaltic lava morphology formed when lava erupts underwater. They form when the exterior of the molten rock cools immediately when it comes in contact with the cold water.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-speckles-in-the-pillow-basalt>What makes the speckles in the pillow basalt?</h2>
<p>These are the result of gas bubbles that were captured in the lava when it cooled. Sometimes the gas bubbles are empty, but other time they get filled with quartz or calcite that precipitated out of mineral-rich water circulating through the basalt, producing the speckles.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-a-pillow-made-of-lava>How big is a pillow made of lava?</h2>
<p>The size of individual pillows varies from 10 cm up to several meters. When pahoehoe lava enters the sea it usually forms pillow basalts. However when a’a enters the ocean it forms a littoral cone, a small cone-shaped accumulation of tuffaceous debris formed when the blocky a’a lava enters the water and explodes from built-up steam.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-pillow-shaped-lava-at-the-golden-gate>What makes the pillow shaped lava at the Golden Gate?</h2>
<p>The rapid cooling of the lava by cold water on all sides forms the pillow-shaped bodies, which can then break open and extrude more of the hot lava from inside. The rapid cooling also creates pillows that are composed of volcanic glass on the outside and that have very tiny, almost invisible crystals on the interior.</p>
