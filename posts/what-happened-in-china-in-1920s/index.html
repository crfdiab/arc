<h2 id=what-happened-in-china-in-1920s>What happened in China in 1920s?</h2>
<p>China in the 1920s was a new republic confronting great challenges—economic, political, and social. One of the most devastating was the early 1920s North China famine. Triggered by a severe drought, the famine killed crops and devastated the livelihood of farmers in the northern plains of China.</p>

<p>When Nationalist leader Sun Yat-sen died of cancer in 1925, a period of political instability followed as to who was to lead. One year later, Chiang Kai-shek emerged as party leader and despite differing politically, both the Chinese Communist Party and the Nationalists advocated for the reunification of China at this time.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-china-during-the-cultural-revolution>Who was the leader of China during the Cultural Revolution?</h2>
<p>Born in 1904, Deng Xiaoping (d. 1997) was one of the first generation of Chinese Communist Party leaders. He held prominent positions in the government in the 1950s and 1960s, but he was removed from office and imprisoned during the years of the Cultural Revolution, 1966-76. His family was persecuted.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-ruler-of-china-in-the-nineteenth-century>Who was the ruler of China in the nineteenth century?</h2>
<p>China was ruled by the Qing family, though the family is better known as the Manchu’s. The Nineteenth Century has seen a marked involvement in China by European powers. Wars – the so-called “Opium Wars” – between China and Britain and France led to defeats for China.</p>
