<h2 id=how-do-plants-respond-to-seasonal-changes-in-florida>How do plants respond to seasonal changes in Florida?</h2>
<p>How do plants in Florida respond to spring? New plants start to grow and sprout. The leaves on trees start to change colors. Plants go dormant and some lose their leaves.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-plants-change-in-florida>How do plants change in Florida?</h2>
<p>The leaves of some plants start to change. When spring begins to change to summer, what seasonal changes occur in Florida plants? More sunlight is available to plants, which causes growth to slow down. Plants begin to sprout and germinate, trees grow buds, and plants begin to flower.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-florida-plants-and-animals-respond-to-seasonal-change>How do Florida plants and animals respond to seasonal change?</h2>
<p>Plants go through seasonal changes after detecting differences in day length. We know they are going to sleep when their leaves begin to fall. Different animals adapt in different ways some animals hibernate during winter, saving food in previous seasons in warm places, caves, to live on during winter.</p>
<h2 id=what-seasonal-changes-can-be-seen-in-florida-plants-during-the-winter-season>What seasonal changes can be seen in Florida plants during the winter season?</h2>
<p>In Florida, what seasonal changes do plants experience when the season changes from fall to winter? All parts of a plant freeze and will regrow in the spring. Little growth happens and some plants lose their leaves. Plants lose their leaves and go into a period of hibernation.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-plants-respond-to-winter-in-florida>How do plants respond to winter in Florida?</h2>
<p>When the fall and winter seasons arrive, we have cooler temperatures and shorter daylight hours. Plants are either long-day plants or short-day plants. When deciduous trees change color or drop leaves, they’re responding to shorter days. The slowing of turfgrass growth is a response to shorter days.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-plants-respond-to-different-seasons>How do plants respond to different seasons?</h2>
<p>Plants can respond to the change of season by losing their leaves, flowering, or breaking dormancy. Plants go through seasonal changes after detecting differences in day length.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-animals-respond-to-winter-in-florida>How do animals respond to winter in Florida?</h2>
<p>They go into torpor in really cold weather. It’s like a kind of suspended animation. Florida reptiles and amphibians become active again if things warm up. In really cold parts of the country, most reptiles brumate for the entire winter.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-plants-and-animals-respond-to-changing-seasons>How do plants and animals respond to changing seasons?</h2>
<p>Sometimes animal adaptations are triggered by weather and seasonal changes. Some plants become dormant and some animals undergo changes to prepare for the winter. Some animals collect food to store during the winter months and others hibernate, migrate, or grow thicker fur.</p>
<h2 id=at-what-temperature-should-i-cover-my-plants-in-florida>At what temperature should I cover my plants in Florida?</h2>
<p>Most plants growing in local landscapes are going to be survivors until temperatures dip to 32 degrees and below. At freezing the tender annuals plus many tropical shrubs and trees are going to show damage.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-protect-my-plants-from-frost-in-florida>How do I protect my plants from frost in Florida?</h2>
<p>When there is a predicted frost, cover plants with sheets, blankets, newspapers, cardboard boxes or other suitable materials. This covering should not be left on more than two or three days, even if you have to re-cover them later. If you use plastic, remove it the next morning.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-plants-in-the-spring>What happens to plants in the spring?</h2>
<p>Plants need water, light, warmth and soil or compost to grow. During spring they get the conditions they need to begin to grow. During the time in the year when the days are longer, like Spring and Summer, there is more sunlight to give the plants heat and light. …</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-are-active-in-winter-in-florida>What animals are active in winter in Florida?</h2>
<p>Like alligators, these cold-blooded animals don’t need as much food during the winter, so their daily activity slows way down. Mammals: Deer, raccoons, bobcats, panthers, possums, mice and the other mammals might have to work a little harder for food during winter months, said Craig Miller, curator of mammals.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-growing-seasons-in-florida>What are the three growing seasons in Florida?</h2>
<p>Florida can be broken into three growing regions: North, Central, & South. Each has a slightly different climate (mainly depending possibility of freezing temperatures). The spring growing season is the time of year to finish the last bit of the Winter harvest (mainly leafy herbs and veggies) & begin the process of planting fruiting plants.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-grow-a-summer-garden-in-florida>Can you grow a summer garden in Florida?</h2>
<p>Summer tends to be too hot for many of the Spring Plants to thrive, but many fruiting plants started during Spring can be harvested into the Summer. There are two major keys to growing a successful Summer Garden in Florida; growing the garden in Morning Sun & Afternoon Shade and making sure that plants are well-watered.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-plants-adapted-to-the-dry-season>How are plants adapted to the dry season?</h2>
<p>Many plants have to face the environment stress of drought during the dry summer season; drought can greatly affect the growth and development. Plants such as wheat respond to drought in many ways.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-plant-seeds-in-florida>When is the best time to plant seeds in Florida?</h2>
<p>South Florida typically begins in late April and can run as late as November. Florida’s Winter Growing Season runs between the slow cooling-off of the Fall through the end of Winter. This season is best suited for growing leafy veggies & herbs. Seeds can be started between Late Summer and into the Fall (September to Early December).</p>
