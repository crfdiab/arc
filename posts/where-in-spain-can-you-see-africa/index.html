<h2 id=where-in-spain-can-you-see-africa>Where in Spain can you see Africa?</h2>
<p>Gibraltar is an overseas territory of Britain. It is located on Spain’s south coast between Europe and Africa, and it is only 14 miles from Africa. This makes it a great place to see Africa from Europe.</p>
<h2 id=does-africa-and-spain-connect>Does Africa and Spain connect?</h2>
<p>The cities are surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea on one side and Morocco on the other and represent the only land connection between Europe and Africa. The fences, along with increased cooperation between Spain and Morocco, have helped control the entry of migrants, with most turned back on the spot.</p>
<h2 id=is-spain-considered-part-of-africa>Is Spain considered part of Africa?</h2>
<p>With an area of 505,990 km2 (195,360 sq mi), Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe, the second-largest country in Western Europe and the European Union, and the fourth-largest country by area on the European continent.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-from-spain-to-africa>How long does it take to get from Spain to Africa?</h2>
<p>Flying time from Spain to South Africa The total flight duration from Spain to South Africa is 10 hours, 39 minutes. If you’re planning a trip, remember to add more time for the plane to taxi between the gate and the airport runway. This measurement is only for the actual flying time.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-africa-from-malaga-and-around-spain>Can you see Africa from Malaga and around, Spain?</h2>
<p>However, due to my visa restrictions, I can only visit Spain now. I wanted to know whether anyone can suggest a good safe and accessible place that I can view Africa! The closest point is Tarifa or Algeciras. From Tarifa you can see Africa (Morocco), but be aware it is quite a distance and you weill not see too much.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-africa-from-tarifa-spain>Can you see Africa from Tarifa, Spain?</h2>
<p>From Tarifa you can see Africa (Morocco), but be aware it is quite a distance and you weill not see too much. If you simply want to be able to say that you saw Africa from Europe then just head to the highest point overlooking the coast near to where you are staying on a clear day and you will be able to see Morocco on the horizon.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-distance-between-spain-and-africa>What is the distance between Spain and Africa?</h2>
<p>Between Tangier and Tarifa -Spanish small town in the province of Cadiz- lies the Mediterranean sea that separates the two continents Europe and Africa with an approximate distance of 30 miles.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-restrictions-on-travel-to-spain-from-india>Are there any restrictions on travel to Spain from India?</h2>
<p>Flights and arrivals from Brazil and South Africa are restricted in Spain until at least June 22. Visitors from India must undergo a 10 day quarantine upon arrival. Visitors from other countries are not permitted to enter, unless they gain special permission from the Spanish government. What are the restrictions?</p>
