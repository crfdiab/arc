<h2 id=why-did-truman-create-the-marshall-plan>Why did Truman create the Marshall Plan?</h2>
<p>The Truman Doctrine essentially meant giving money and weapons to enemies of the USSR. The Marshall Plan was an attempt to get all of Europe in debt to the USA and allow the Americans to dominate it. The American view was that the Truman Doctrine was stopping the continuing spread of Communism.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-the-marshall-plan-help-the-us-economy>How did the Marshall Plan help the US economy?</h2>
<p>The Marshall Plan generated a resurgence of European industrialization and brought extensive investment into the region. It was also a stimulant to the U.S. economy by establishing markets for American goods.</p>

<p>Marshall Plan. On the basis of a unified plan for western European economic reconstruction presented by a committee representing 16 countries, the U.S. Congress authorized the establishment of the European Recovery Program, which was signed into law by President Harry S.

<h2 id=why-did-the-uk-participate-in-the-marshall-plan>Why did the UK participate in the Marshall Plan?</h2>
<p>United Kingdom: Economic crisis and relief (1947) …Soviet Union immediately denounced the Marshall Plan as the beginning of a division between the East and the West, all western European countries, including Britain, hastened to participate.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-did-the-us-donate-to-the-marshall-plan>How much money did the US donate to the Marshall Plan?</h2>
<p>During the four years the plan was in effect, the United States donated $17 billion (equivalent to $198.13 billion in 2018) in economic and technical assistance to help the recovery of the European countries that joined the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-was-the-marshall-plan-supposed-to-last>How long was the Marshall Plan supposed to last?</h2>
<p>In its legislative form as the European Recovery Program (ERP), the Marshall Plan was originally expected to last four and one-quarter years from April 1, 1948, until June 30, 1952. However, the duration of the “official” Marshall Plan, as well as amounts expended under it, are matters of some disagreement.</p>
