<h2 id=what-happened-when-india-was-colonized-by-britain>What happened when India was colonized by Britain?</h2>
<p>By the middle of the century, the British had already gained direct or indirect control over almost all of India. In 1947, India gained its independence and was partitioned into the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan, the latter of which was created as a homeland for colonial India’s Muslims.</p>
<h2 id=what-good-did-britain-do-for-india>What good did Britain do for India?</h2>
<p>The British were able to take control of India mainly because India was not united. The British signed treaties and made military and trading alliances with many of the independent states that made up India. The British were very effective at infiltrating these states and gradually taking control.</p>
<h2 id=what-if-the-british-had-not-colonized-india>What if the British had not colonized India?</h2>
<p>If the British had not conquered India they would have fought harder in United States and taken back their colonies during the War of 1812. France would not have sold Louisiana as they would still be getting money from trade with India.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-india-was-not-colonized>What would happen if India was not colonized?</h2>
<p>India had always been a peaceful nation and would have nothing to with the World War II had it not been under the rule of the British. The unscrupulous wartime policies of the British to supply food to soldiers at war led to the shortage of food in Bengal and Bihar causing millions of deaths out of starvation.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-want-to-colonize-india>Why did the British want to colonize India?</h2>
<p>British Colonization of India. The British had a clear goal: to westernize and Christianize India, using all possible means. One of the main reasons for the Europeans to sail the oceans was to find new trade routes to Asia, especially, to India.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-india-become-part-of-the-british-empire>When did India become part of the British Empire?</h2>
<p>Then, finally in 1950 CE, the process had reversed and the Indian economy had become around 64% of the British economy. This clearly shows the rise of the Britain and a simultaneous fall of the Indian economy during the period of the British engagement in India.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-british-use-divide-and-conquer-in-india>How did the British use divide and conquer in India?</h2>
<p>The British Empire adopted the age-old political strategy of divide and conquer throughout their colonization of India. The occupiers used the strategy to turn locals against each other to help them rule the region. Whenever the British felt threatened by Indian nationalism and saw it growing, they divided the Indian people along religious lines.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-british-do-in-india-after-the-mutiny>What did the British do in India after the mutiny?</h2>
<p>English Life in India. American Publishing Co., 1877/now in public domain. Following the Indian Mutiny, the East India Company was abolished and the British crown assumed full rule of India. Reforms were instituted, which included tolerance of religion and the recruitment of Indians into the civil service.</p>
