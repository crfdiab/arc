<h2 id=can-a-tornado-pick-up-a-tanker-truck>Can a tornado pick up a tanker truck?</h2>
<p>Could a tornado pick up a tank truck like in Twister? No. We have often wondered why the tank truck, weighing perhaps 80,000 pounds or more was picked up, but the pickup truck, weighing 3000 pounds, was not picked up.</p>
<h2 id=should-you-outrun-a-tornado-in-a-car-or-truck>Should you outrun a tornado in a car or truck?</h2>
<p>Cars, buses, and trucks are easily tossed by tornado winds. DO NOT TRY TO OUTRUN A TORNADO IN YOUR CAR. If you’re outside in a car or in a mobile home, go immediately to the basement of a nearby sturdy building. Sturdy buildings are the safest place to be.</p>
<h2 id=has-a-tornado-ever-picked-up-a-semi-truck>Has a tornado ever picked up a semi truck?</h2>
<p>In a scene straight out of a blockbuster disaster movie, big-rig trucks were tossed high into the air like toys when huge tornadoes slammed into Dallas yesterday (April 3). The first thing that allows them to lift trucks, he said, is that tornadoes generate a serious amount of updraft suction in their cores.</p>
<h2 id=what-equipment-do-you-need-for-a-tornado>What equipment do you need for a tornado?</h2>
<p>Keep a manual can opener and emergency tools including a fire extinguisher, battery-powered radio, flashlight and plenty of batteries. Be sure to gather the following items to ensure your family’s basic comfort and well-being in case of evacuation.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-thing-a-tornado-can-pick-up>What is the biggest thing a tornado can pick up?</h2>
<p>An EF-5 tornado, with rotational speeds of 310 to 500 miles per hour, can rip up entire houses and send them hurtling through the air. According to the records of the US Weather Service, the heaviest load lifted by a tornado was a 75-ton railroad car that was thrown hundreds of meters away. :D.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-national-weather-service-track-tornadoes>How does the National Weather Service track tornadoes?</h2>
<p>Meteorologists at the U.S. National Weather Service use Doppler radar, satellites, weather balloons, and computer modeling to watch the skies for severe storms and tornadic activity. Doppler radars record wind speeds and identify areas of rotation within thunderstorms.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-killed-each-year-by-tornadoes>How many people are killed each year by tornadoes?</h2>
<p>U.S. tornadoes cause 80 deaths and more than 1,500 injuries per year. What is a tornado? A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. It’s often portended by a dark, greenish sky.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-an-average-tornado-when-it-hits-the-ground>How big is an average tornado when it hits the ground?</h2>
<p>Once a tornado hits the ground, it may live for as little as a few seconds or as long as three hours. The average twister is about 660 feet wide and moves about 30 miles an hour. Most don’t travel more than six miles before dying out.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-tornadoes-measured-on-the-fujita-scale>How are tornadoes measured on the Fujita scale?</h2>
<p>Using units F0 to F5, the Fujita scale measures a tornado’s intensity by analysing the damage the twister has done and then matching that to the wind speeds estimated to produce comparable damage. The United States now uses the EF (Enhanced Fujita) scale, which takes more variables into account when assigning wind speeds to a tornado.</p>
