<h2 id=what-is-the-lifestyle-in-russia>What is the lifestyle in Russia?</h2>
<p>Russian culture is non-individualistic. The power of an individual in Russia is much less than in the west and most deals are pushed through family, friends and acquaintances. A famous Russian saying is, “One is not a soldier in the battlefield.” In Russia, it is necessary to know people in power to make things work.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-average-russian-live>How does the average Russian live?</h2>
<p>The average Russian family, comprised of three to four people, lives in a two-room apartment that is approximately 50 square meters in size. In fact, 64 percent of Russian families live in apartments smaller than 60 square meters. Let’s take a short tour of a typical Russian apartment.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-most-russian-people-live>How do most Russian people live?</h2>
<p>The vast majority of Russia’s population live in the western core area of the country, the region around the capital city of Moscow. Very few people live in Siberia, but the region is rich with natural resources. The most contentious region in Russia is the Caucasus Mountain region, especially the area of Chechnya.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-expensive-to-live-in-russia>Is it expensive to live in Russia?</h2>
<p>Life for expats in Russia is generally comfortable, with expenses such as groceries and utility bills being fairly inexpensive even in major cities such as Moscow. Outside of the major metropolitan areas, prices are even cheaper, with lower bills for food and transportation.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-life-does-the-russian-people-have>What kind of life does the Russian people have?</h2>
<p>Russians do not consider their life miserable. They feel that things are changing for the better and “everything’s starting to work out” for their country. Russians like to emphasize their different attitude towards material values and consider themselves as sincere]</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-life-in-russia-and-the-west>What’s the difference between life in Russia and the west?</h2>
<p>The majority of Russian people do not really understand the huge difference between life in Russia and in the West. Russians do not consider their life miserable. They feel that things are changing for the better and “everything’s starting to work out” for their country.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-best-place-to-live-in-russia>Where is the best place to live in Russia?</h2>
<p>Living in the historical center is considered to be prestigious, but the poor quality of air, the traffic situation, exorbitant prices and the prevalence of commercial buildings make a lot of streets a questionable win. Still, there are several really nice streets where most people would like to live.</p>
