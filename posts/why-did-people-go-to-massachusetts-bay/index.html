<h2 id=why-did-people-go-to-massachusetts-bay>Why did people go to Massachusetts Bay?</h2>
<p>“While the Pilgrims were occupied with the problems of survival, the better organized and provisioned Puritans who founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony came with a mission, to establish their own shining ‘citty [sic] upon a Hill,’ free of the sin and corruption of the land and society they were leaving.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-most-settlers-come-to-plymouth-and-massachusetts-bay>Why did most settlers come to Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay?</h2>
<p>Plymouth Colony, America’s first permanent Puritan settlement, was established by English Separatist Puritans in December 1620. The Pilgrims left England to seek religious freedom, or simply to find a better life.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-british-take-over-the-massachusetts-bay-colony>When did the British take over the Massachusetts Bay Colony?</h2>
<p>After King Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660, the British government attempted to take more control of the Massachusetts Bay Colony by sending a series of royal commissions, first in 1664 and then again in 1676, to settle land disputes and reform the colony’s administrations.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-massachusetts-bay-colony-move-the-praying-towns>When did the Massachusetts Bay Colony move the Praying towns?</h2>
<p>During the winter of 1675-76, the Massachusetts Bay Colony decreed that the inhabitants of the praying towns must be relocated. On October 30, 1675, a large body of Christian Indians were forced in shackles to the Charles River.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-life-like-in-the-massachusetts-bay-colony>What was the life like in the Massachusetts Bay Colony?</h2>
<p>The colony was thriving and the colonists were happy with the current system of government. The people of Massachusetts Bay Colony had labored hard and sacrificed to establish their system and were proud of their theocratic government.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-died-in-the-massachusetts-bay-colony>How many people died in the Massachusetts Bay Colony?</h2>
<p>In the preceding autumn the colony contained about three hundred, inhabitants; eighty of these had died, and a great part of the survivors were in a weak and sickly state. Their supply of corn was not sufficient for more than a fortnight, and their other provisions were nearly exhausted.</p>
