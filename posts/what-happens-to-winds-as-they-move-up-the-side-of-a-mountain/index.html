<h2 id=what-happens-to-winds-as-they-move-up-the-side-of-a-mountain>What happens to winds as they move up the side of a mountain?</h2>
<p>As winds rise up the windward side of a mountain range, the air cools and precipitation falls. On the other side of the range, the leeward side, the air is dry, and it sinks. So there is very little precipitation on the leeward side of a mountain range.</p>
<h2 id=what-side-of-a-mountain-receives-more-precipitation>What side of a mountain receives more precipitation?</h2>
<p>windward side<br>
Much of airborne moisture falls as rain on the windward side of mountains. This often means that the land on the other side of the mountain (the leeward side) gets far less rain—an effect called a “rain shadow”—which often produces a desert.</p>
<h2 id=does-wind-go-up-or-down-mountains>Does wind go up or down mountains?</h2>
<p>Mountain winds blow from mountain towards valley after sunset, when mountain cools down and valley zone is comparatively warmer. While valley breezes occur when the warm air rises up the sides of the valley, warm air in a mountain breeze will rise up the middle.</p>
<h2 id=what-will-happen-if-a-mountain-lies-in-the-way-of-a-rain-bearing-wind>What will happen if a mountain lies in the way of a rain bearing wind?</h2>
<p>Mountains and mountain ranges can cast a rain shadow. As winds rise up the windward side of a mountain range, the air cools and precipitation falls. On the other side of the range, the leeward side, the air is dry, and it sinks.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-warm-air-rises-over-a-mountain>What happens when warm air rises over a mountain?</h2>
<p>As a cloud goes over a mountain, it rises. As air rises, it expands because there is less atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes. As air expands, it cools. After it passes over the mountain, it drops down in elevation and the air becomes compressed and becomes warmer.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-windward-side-of-a-mountain-range>Which is the windward side of a mountain range?</h2>
<p>The windward side of a mountain range is the side that receives the wind; the leeward side is the side where air sinks.The descending air warms and creates strong, dry winds. Chinook winds can raise temperatures more than 20oC (36oF) in an hour and they rapidly decrease humidity.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-air-moves-up-a-mountain>What happens when air moves up a mountain?</h2>
<p>When air reaches the mountains, it is forced to rise over this barrier. As the air moves up the windward side of a mountain, it cools, and the volume decreases. As a result, humidity increases and orographic clouds and precipitation can develop.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-altitude-of-a-mountain-affect-precipitation>How does the altitude of a mountain affect precipitation?</h2>
<p>As a result, humidity increases and orographic clouds and precipitation can develop. When the air descends the leeward side, it warms and is drier because the moisture in the air was wrung out during the ascent. This area with a lack of moisture is known as a rain shadow.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-less-windy-in-a-valley-than-on-a-hill>Why is it less windy in a valley than on a hill?</h2>
<p>So winds from above affect the valley, and winds from the sides likely affect it more as well. At many times there may not be as much of the up and down as you’ve drawn… but other than that, it looks more like your top figure because of the mixing. Whereas at night, wind near the surface start to calm.</p>
