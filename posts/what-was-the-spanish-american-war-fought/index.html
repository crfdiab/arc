<h2 id=what-was-the-spanish-american-war-fought>What was the Spanish American War fought?</h2>
<p>The Spanish-American War was an 1898 conflict between the United States and Spain that ended Spanish colonial rule in the Americas and resulted in U.S. acquisition of territories in the western Pacific and Latin America.</p>
<h2 id=who-liberated-cuba-from-spain>Who liberated Cuba from Spain?</h2>
<p>Carlos Manuel de Céspedes<br>
The Struggle for Independence On 10 October 1868, the landowner Carlos Manuel de Céspedes declared Cuban independence and freedom for his slaves. This began the Ten Years’ War, which lasted from 1868 to 1878.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-us-help-cuba-gain-independence-from-spain>Why did the US help Cuba gain independence from Spain?</h2>
<p>In order to prevent the possibility of US annexation of Cuba, Congress passed the Teller Amendment, which proclaimed that the United States would help the Cuban people gain their freedom from Spain but would not annex the island after victory.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-america-fight-the-spanish-american-war>Why did America fight the Spanish American War?</h2>
<p>The reasons for war were many, but there were two immediate ones: America’s support the ongoing struggle by Cubans and Filipinos against Spanish rule, and the mysterious explosion of the battleship U.S.S. Maine in Havana Harbor. Their quest was described as a “splendid little war” by Secretary of State John Hay.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-spanish-declare-war-on-cuba>When did the Spanish declare war on Cuba?</h2>
<p>It wasn’t until the British occupation of Havana in June 1762 (shortly after England declared war on Spain) that Cuban planters were able to sell their goods on the open market. Under traditional Spanish rule, they sold their goods to the Spanish government, who set the prices and was their only legal customer.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-cuban-war-of-independence>Who was involved in the Cuban War of Independence?</h2>
<p>José Martí and The Cuban Revolutionary Party. Cuba’s second war of independence began in 1895, after years of meticulous planning by José Martí, who united some of the surviving veterans of The Ten Year War; Antonio Maceo, Máximo Gómez, Calixto García and others.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-cuba-gain-its-independence-from-spain>When did Cuba gain its independence from Spain?</h2>
<p>Cuba was a Spanish colony until Spain’s defeat in the Spanish-American War.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-ten-years-war-in-cuba>What was the outcome of the Ten Years War in Cuba?</h2>
<p>Cuba – First War for Independence / The Ten Years War – 1868-1878. However, the military victories were turned in a way into a set back due to political differences among the revolutionaries, which eventually led to Céspedes’ removal from his position as President of the Republic in Arms (1873).</p>
