<h2 id=what-does-freya-the-viking-god-like-doing>What does Freya the Viking god like doing?</h2>
<p>Freyja (Old Norse: “[the] Lady”) is the goddess of love, beauty, sex, fertility, seiðr, war, and death in Norse mythology. Freyja rules over the heavenly field(s) of Fólkvangr, where she receives half of those that die in battle, as the other half go to Valhalla. …</p>

<p>Unlike the other norse gods her death was never mentioned and worship of the goddess still continued even after the gods and their religion fell and was replaced. Freya is also a protection goddess as she looks after the dead. But just like with everyone she is thought of as evil because of some of her actions.</p>
<h2 id=is-freya-a-valkyrie-god-of-war>Is Freya a Valkyrie god of war?</h2>
<p>Valkyrie Powers: Freya was known for having Valkyrie Wings and Powers, although they were stripped from her when she broke off her marriage with Odin. Immortality: As a Vanir God, Freya is unaging, as despite being millennia old, she still retains the appearance of a woman in her prime.</p>

<h2 id=why-did-loki-kill-his-mother>Why did Loki kill his mother?</h2>
<p>Loki knows he failed his mother and regrets letting his ego get in the way. His selfish nature towards Thor inadvertently killed her and at this point, he starts to think of redemption, which is what Frigga would have wanted.</p>

<p>Óðr<br>
Freyja is married to Óðr, who goes on long travels, and the two have a very fair daughter by the name of Hnoss. While Óðr is absent, Freyja stays behind and in her sorrow she weeps tears of red gold.</p>
<h2 id=is-freya-thors-mother>Is Freya Thor’s mother?</h2>

<p>Pigs were sacred to her, and she rode a boar with golden bristles. A chariot drawn by cats was another of her vehicles. It was Freyja’s privilege to choose one-half of the heroes slain in battle for her great hall in the Fólkvangar (the god Odin took the other half to Valhalla).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-things-named-after-the-goddess-freya>What are the things named after the goddess Freya?</h2>
