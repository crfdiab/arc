<h2 id=how-was-carstensz-pyramid-formed>How was Carstensz Pyramid formed?</h2>
<p>The mountain, which is composed of middle Miocene limestone, was formed by a collision between the Australian and Pacific plates. [Related: What is Plate Tectonics?] Carstensz Pyramid is close to the world’s largest goldmine in Grasberg, making it a highly protected area.</p>

Puncak Jaya/Elevation<br>
Puncak Jaya, or Carstensz Pyramid, is a mountain peak on the continent of Oceania. It is located in Indonesia, in the province of Papua. It is part of the Sudirman mountain range. At 4,884 meters (16,024 feet) high, it is the tallest mountain in the southwestern Pacific.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-climb-carstensz-pyramid>How long does it take to climb Carstensz Pyramid?</h2>
<p>one day<br>
There are a few sections on the route that require rock climbing skills up to 5.6 difficulty. Carstensz Pyramid is a one day climb, necessitating a pre-dawn departure to avoid the afternoon equatorial precipitation. Proficiency with fixed ropes, ascenders, rappelling, and experience rock climbing are required.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-someone-climbed-the-carstensz-pyramid>When was the last time someone climbed the Carstensz Pyramid?</h2>
<p>The last time this happened was between 1995 to July 2005. If you don’t have the required permit, even a helicopter won’t help you. Pilots are not allowed to take you on board because their company would loose the permit to fly in Papua if they do.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-puncak-jaya-named-after-carstensz-pyramid>Why was Puncak Jaya named after Carstensz Pyramid?</h2>
<p>Discovery. Puncak Jaya was named “Carstensz Pyramid” after Dutch explorer Jan Carstenszoon who first sighted the glaciers on the peak of the mountain on a rare clear day in 1623. The sighting went unverified for over two centuries, and Carstensz was ridiculed in Europe when he said he had seen snow near the equator.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-carstensz-pyramid-the-highest-mountain-in-australia>Why is the Carstensz Pyramid the highest mountain in Australia?</h2>
<p>The reason stated by Messner, is that Carstensz Pyramid 4884 m (16023 ft) is the highest mountain of Australia and Oceania. This divided the mountaineers into two camps, Kosciusko and Carstensz. It was (and still is) difficult to arrive to a final judgment as discussed on our 7 Summits history page.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-last-person-to-climb-7-summits>Who was the last person to climb 7 Summits?</h2>
<p>The last peak that Reinhold Messner climbed was Vinson on 3 DEC 1986 (in Carstensz and Kosciuszko lists) It could be thus said that Patrick Allan Morrow was the first person that finished 7 Summits including the Carstensz Pyramid (Puncak Jaya), which is in present considered as a truly complete climb of the Seven Summits.</p>
