<p>Abstract: Hurricane Katrina caused significant damage to the transportation system in the Gulf Coast region. The overall cost to repair or replace the bridges damaged during the hurricane is estimated at over $1 billion.</p>

<p>While many repairs are made over long periods of time after storms, identifying when the majority of recovery takes place highlights the primary recovery period. Remodeling after Hurricane Katrina leveled out in January 2007 putting the primary recovery period at 18 months after the storm.</p>

<p>If your destroyed home was insured and in the State of California, you now have the right to collect all benefits that would have covered rebuilding your destroyed home, and use those benefits to buy a replacement home instead. California law specifically requires insurance companies to pay the same amount they would …</p>

<p>If you face a total loss, you will receive the replacement cost amount on your home whether you decide to rebuild there or not. If you do not, you will only receive the replacement cost amount if you decide to rebuild in the same spot. If you decide to cash out and move, you will receive the depreciated amount.</p>

<p>No matter the amount of damage, you likely can’t stay in your own home. If staying with friends or family isn’t an option, talk to your local disaster relief agency, such as the American Red Cross or Salvation Army. These organizations will help you find a safe place to stay temporarily. Contact your insurance agent.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cost-of-the-hurricane-katrina>What was the cost of the Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>An interesting fact is that Hurricane Katrina remains the costliest hurricane in U.S. history, causing an estimated $161 billion in damage along the U.S. Gulf Coast. It destroyed or damaged more than 850,000 homes. Between 300,000 to 350,000 vehicles were also destroyed, as well as 2,400 ships and vessels.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-died-in-new-orleans-after-hurricane-katrina>How many people died in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>While “only” a Category 3 hurricane when it hit the coast, Katrina and its aftermath resulted in 1,863 deaths. Although 90 percent of New Orleans’s pre-storm population is back and much of the city has been rebuilt, neighborhoods such as the Lower Ninth Ward have not had the same amount of post-Katrina growth.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-congress-do-for-new-orleans-after-hurricane-katrina>What did Congress do for New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>Michael Clancy: After Hurricane Katrina, Congress made a national commitment to the recovery and resilience of southeastern Louisiana.. The New Orleans District got $14.6 billion to upgrade the flood and hurricane defenses of the Greater New Orleans area.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-total-cost-of-hurricane-harvey>What was the total cost of Hurricane Harvey?</h2>
<p>The cumulative costs of the 16 separate billion-dollar weather events in the U.S. in 2017 was $306.2 billion, breaking the previous cost record of $214.8 billion (2005). It is estimated that Hurricane Harvey alone had total costs of $125 billion—second only to Hurricane Katrina in the period of record, which had an approximate cost of $161 billion.</p>
