<h2 id=how-does-climate-influence-settlement>How does climate influence settlement?</h2>
<p>The most widespread direct risk to human settlements from climate change is flooding and landslides. Projected increases in rainfall intensity and, in coastal areas, sea-level rise will be the culprits. Cities on rivers and coasts are particularly at risk. Figure 1 shows the projected impact on low-lying areas.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-climate-affect-nepal>How does climate affect Nepal?</h2>
<p>Climate change has hit Nepal hard, and it has hit fast. It is causing greater variations in weather patterns and more extreme weather events, like the drought that contributed to the exceptional number of wildfires that raged across Nepal during 2016’s pre-monsoon season.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-climate-affect-communities>How does climate affect communities?</h2>
<p>Climate change affects human health and wellbeing through more extreme weather events and wildfires, decreased air quality, and diseases transmitted by insects, food, and water. Some climate changes currently have beneficial effects for specific sectors or regions.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-has-climate-change-been-noticed-in-nepal>What impact has climate change been noticed in Nepal?</h2>
<p>It has resulted in heavy floods, landslides and soil erosion. It is also common to find drought in many parts of Nepal that comes from the impacts of climate change and it impacts sectors like forest, water resources, agriculture, human health and biodiversity.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-environment-affect-settlement>How does environment affect settlement?</h2>
<p>Impact of Human Settlement on the Environment Human settlement affects the environment in many ways. Growing and concentrated populations need land, food and water, as well as other necessities like heat and sewage disposal. In Canada’s urban and rural communities these needs put stress on the natural environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-nepal>What are the effects of Nepal?</h2>
<p>Nepal is highly vulnerable to a number of disasters for example: earthquakes, floods, landslides, fires, epidemics, avalanches, windstorms, hailstorms, lightning, glacier lake outburst floods, droughts and dangerous weather events. Among these disasters—earthquake is the most- scary and damaging.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-problems-of-human-settlement-in-developing-countries>What are the problems of human settlement in developing countries?</h2>
<p>The settlements in developing countries, suffer from various problems, such as unsustainable concentration of population, congested housing and streets, lack of drinking water facilities. They also lack infrastructure such as, electricity, sewage disposal, health and education facilities.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-altitude-affect-the-climate-in-nepal>How does altitude affect the climate in Nepal?</h2>
<p>The most important factor that has influenced the climate in Nepal is the altitude. Climatic conditions of Nepal vary from one place to another in accordance with the geographical features. It has a variety of climates ranging from tropical climate, subtropical, warm, temperate, subarctic or alpine to fully arctic or tundra climate.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-temperate-zone-in-nepal>How tall is the temperate zone in Nepal?</h2>
<p>Subtropical and tropical zones are located below 3,900 feet, the temperate zones between 3,900 and 7,900 feet, cold zones between 7,900 and 11,800 feet, subarctic zones between 11,800 and 14,400 feet, and the arctic zones above 14,400 feet.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-climate-does-nepal-have-in-winter>What kind of climate does Nepal have in winter?</h2>
<p>This region has a profound effect on the climate of the entire country and that of the entire India subcontinent. During winter, the great Himalayan range prevents the cold air from Inner Asia from reaching Nepal, making winter in the country generally dry. However, the winter temperature in this region can plummet under subzero.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-national-adaptation-plan-of-action-for-nepal>What is the National Adaptation Plan of action for Nepal?</h2>
<p>Nepal’s National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) prepared in 2010 also recognizes that climate will be uncertain and vulnerability will increase. Climate-related disasters can broadly be caused by rapid-onset events and slow-onset events.</p>
