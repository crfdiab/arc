<p>The Dreaming is the environment that the Aboriginals lived in, and it still do today. Dreamings allow Aboriginal people to understand their place in traditional society and nature, and connects their spiritual world of the past with the present and the future. The Dreamings explain the creation process.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-dreamtime-an-essential-part-of-aboriginal-life>How is Dreamtime an essential part of Aboriginal life?</h2>
<p>Dreamtime is the foundation of Aboriginal religion and culture. It dates back some 65,000 years. It is the story of events that have happened, how the universe came to be, how human beings were created and how their Creator intended for humans to function within the world as they knew it.</p>

<p>1890s<br>
How did the Dreamtime word originate? The Dreamtime came into being as a word to describe the Aboriginal Creation mythology, and was first used in the 1890s. It was developed from Aranda culture by a white man who was based in Alice Springs and had a very good working knowledge of the local Aboriginal languages.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-dream-time-like-for-the-aboriginals>What was the dream time like for the Aboriginals?</h2>
<p>Here are Dreamtime stories from Aboriginal Australia: At the beginning of the Dreamtime, the earth was flat and dry and empty. There were no trees, no rivers, no animals and no grass.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-snake-people-in-aboriginal-dreamtime-stories>Who are the Snake People in Aboriginal Dreamtime stories?</h2>
<p>There are many references to snake people and lizard people in Aboriginal Dreamtime stories, a variation on the Wandjina creator belief. Known by many names, the Rainbow Serpent creator god appears in many Aboriginal creation stories. This is a term first coined by British anthropologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown in 1926.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-the-aboriginal-people>What was life like for the Aboriginal people?</h2>
<p>According to Aboriginal belief, all life as it is today – Human, Animal, Bird and Fish is part of one vast unchanging network of relationships which can be traced to the great spirit ancestors of the Dreamtime. The Dreamtime continues as the “Dreaming” in the spiritual lives of aboriginal people today.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-origin-of-dreamtime-stories-in-australia>What are the origin of Dreamtime stories in Australia?</h2>
<p>For example, Dreamtime stories of giant spirit animals are now believed to be based on the coexistence of the original inhabitants of Australia with ancient megafauna thousands of years ago. Top image: Aboriginal origin stories abound and vary across Australia.</p>
