<h2 id=who-must-file-hawaii-state-income-tax>Who Must File Hawaii state income tax?</h2>
<p>Resident: If you lived in Hawaii for at least 200 days, you are considered a resident unless you were there for educational or work purposes (military) alone. As a resident, you must file a Hawaii state tax return if: You do business in Hawaii. You qualify for a refund or a credit.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-same-sex-married-couples-file-federal-taxes>How do same-sex married couples file federal taxes?</h2>
<p>A2. Yes. For tax year 2013 and going forward, same-sex spouses generally must file using a married filing separately or jointly filing status.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-you-have-to-live-in-hawaii-to-be-considered-a-resident>How long do you have to live in Hawaii to be considered a resident?</h2>
<p>A Hawaii Resident is an individual that is domiciled in Hawaii or an individual that resides in Hawaii for other than temporary purpose. An individual domiciled outside Hawaii is considered a Hawaii resident if they spend more than 200 days in Hawaii.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-have-to-file-state-taxes-in-hawaii>Do I have to file state taxes in Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Each year, a nonresident who earns income from Hawaiʻi sources must file a State of Hawaiʻi tax return and will be taxed only on income from Hawaiʻi sources. If the person has not received taxable income from a Hawaiʻi source during the past calendar year, a state tax return does not need to be filed.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-same-sex-couple-file-a-federal-tax-return-together>Can a same sex couple file a federal tax return together?</h2>
<p>All legally married couples must now file married returns, either jointly or separately, at both the state and federal level. At least 13 states had resisted accepting married returns from same-sex couples prior to Obergefell v. Hodges, but they were now obligated to do so and that remains the case in 2019.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-same-sex-couple-file-jointly-in-california>Can a same-sex couple file jointly in California?</h2>
<p>However, only married couples can file jointly at the federal level. In California, certain unmarried heterosexual couples who live together can also register as domestic partners and file joint state tax returns. To qualify, one of the partners must be at least age 62.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-state-tax-returns-do-unmarried-couples-have-to-file>How many state tax returns do unmarried couples have to file?</h2>
<p>Most states base their joint return computations on the figures from your joint federal return. This means that while married couples only have to file two returns – one for federal and one for state—generally, unmarried domestic partners must complete a total of four tax returns.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-virginia-couple-file-a-joint-tax-return>Can a Virginia couple file a joint tax return?</h2>
<p>The Virginia couple has never been able to file joint returns at the federal or state levels, but because the IRS has adopted a “state of celebration” standard, they may now file a joint federal return so long as they have a marriage certificate issued by another state that recognizes same-sex marriage.</p>
