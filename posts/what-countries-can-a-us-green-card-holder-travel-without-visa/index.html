<h2 id=can-green-card-holders-visit-europe-without-visa>Can green card holders visit Europe without visa?</h2>
<p>Do Green Card Holders Need a Visa to Travel to Europe? US Green Card holders, who are also nationals of third countries that have not established a visa-free regime with the EU, will need to obtain a Schengen Visa, in order to be able to travel to Europe.</p>
<h2 id=can-green-card-holders-travel-abroad-without-passport>Can green card holders travel abroad without passport?</h2>
<p>As a US permanent resident, you are allowed to freely travel outside of the US. To travel, you usually need your permanent resident card, a valid passport, and whatever visas are required by the country you intend to visit. As a US immigration lawyer, I can prepare and file your reentry permit application for you.</p>
<h2 id=do-us-green-card-holders-need-visa-for-uk>Do U.S. green card holders need visa for UK?</h2>
<p>Do Green Card Holders Need Visa for UK? Yes, they do. Unfortunately, a Green Card does not allow the holder to enter the UK just like it does not allow them to enter the European Union. You can check whether you need a visa for the UK here, and how you can apply for a UK visa if you are in the USA here.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-travel-to-dubai-with-green-card>Can I travel to Dubai with green card?</h2>
<p>If you are a citizen of a country not listed above, even if you have a US green Card or a US student visa, you will need to obtain a visa for your travel to the UAE. If your stay will be longer than one month, then regardless of citizenship, you will be required to obtain a visit visa.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-visit-uk-with-us-green-card>Can I visit UK with U.S. green card?</h2>
<p>Do U.S. green card holders need visa to visit the UK? There is usually a special visa waiver for U.S. citizens but green card holders are not that advantaged. This means that as a U.S. green card holder you will need to apply for a visa to enter into the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id=do-us-green-card-holders-need-visa-for-uk-1>Do US green card holders need visa for UK?</h2>
<p>Green Card holders or US residents may be required to obtain a visa to travel to the United Kingdom depending on their country of citizenship and the purpose of travel. The UK government has established types of visas that fit every traveler based on their purpose of entry.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-go-to-germany-with-green-card>Can I go to Germany with green card?</h2>
<p>All non-US citizens who do need a visa to enter the Schengen Area, who have legal residence status in the United States (e.g. Green Card holders; F1 (I-20), H1B, G1, J1, etc.), with three (3) months validity after returning from the Schengen area, are eligible to apply for a Germany Visa in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-stay-more-than-6-months-outside-us-with-green-card>Can I stay more than 6 months outside US with green card?</h2>
<p>Now you know the answer to “can I stay more than 6 months outside the U.S. with a green card?”. Yes, you can, as long as you only travel for a temporary purpose. Otherwise, you might be regarded as having abandoned your LPR status. Don’t be caught off guard when returning from your travels.</p>
