<p>South Africa has three cities that serve as capitals: Pretoria (executive), Cape Town (legislative), and Bloemfontein (judicial). Johannesburg, the largest urban area in the country and a centre of commerce, lies at the heart of the populous Gauteng province.</p>

<p>The most well-known example of a country with two capital cities is Bolivia. La Paz and Sucre are two cities that have agreed to divide the different parts of the government between them.</p>
<h2 id=does-russia-have-2-capitals>Does Russia have 2 capitals?</h2>
<p>From early modern times until the present, Russia (temporarily extended to the USSR) had two capital cities: Moscow and Petersburg. Moscow was the original capital, it was succeeded by Petersburg from the beginning of the 18th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-capitals-of-south-africa>What are the three capitals of South Africa?</h2>
<p>Unlike most countries in the world, South Africa has not one but three capitals. Pretoria, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein are the official capitals of South Africa. Tracing back to South Africa’s history and power struggle, it was only wise to spread out its government into various cities. This was done mostly to avoid giving one city too much power.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-only-country-to-have-three-capital-cities>Which is the only country to have three capital cities?</h2>
<p>The reason that South Africa is the only country in the world with three different official capitals goes back to the 1910 unification of South Africa. At this point in time the four founding provinces of South Africa, Cape Colony, Orange River Colony, Transvaal Colony and Natal Colony, could not decide a capital city that could be shared by all.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-legislative-capital-of-south-africa>Which is the legislative capital of South Africa?</h2>
<p>Cape Townis the legislative capital. It is home to the country’s legislative parliament, including the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces. Located in the southwest corner of South Africa in the province of Western Cape, Cape Town is the second-largest city in population. Bloemfontein is considered the judicial capital.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-cape-town-become-the-capital-of-south-africa>When did Cape Town become the capital of South Africa?</h2>
<p>After several attempts by the British to take control of the area, Cape Town became a British colony in 1814 when it was designated as the colonial capital. Two Boer republics and Natal, a British colony, were joined with the Cape Colony in 1910, founding the Union of South Africa.</p>
