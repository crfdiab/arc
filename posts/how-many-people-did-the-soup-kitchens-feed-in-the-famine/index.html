<h2 id=how-many-people-did-the-soup-kitchens-feed-in-the-famine>How many people did the soup kitchens feed in the famine?</h2>
<p>Soup kitchens were set up in all but three of Ireland’s 130 Poor Law Unions and the rations were being given to 780,000 people by May. By the start of June, this number had increased to 2,700,000. At their peak, in mid August, over three million people were being fed daily by the scheme.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-were-in-workhouses-during-the-famine>How many people were in workhouses during the famine?</h2>
<p>Who decided the new Poor Law Workhouse system was good for Ireland? When all decisions transferred to the British Parliament in London (by way of the Act of Union in 1800) it was estimated that 2.3 million people in Ireland were living on the verge of starvation.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-a-soup-kitchens-in-the-famine>What was a soup kitchens in the famine?</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1847, the government set up some soup kitchens to give the starving people hot soup. A group called the Society of Friend, or the Quakers, did a lot of work to feed the poor. They bought huge boilers in which to cook the soup. By August 1847, about 3 million people were being fed each day in total.</p>

<p>The government, under the direction of Prime Minister Russell, had decided on an abrupt change of policy “to keep the people alive.” The starving Irish were now to be fed for free through soup kitchens sponsored by local relief committees and by groups such as the Quakers and the British Relief Association, a private …</p>
<h2 id=did-the-irish-fish-during-the-famine>Did the Irish fish during the famine?</h2>
<p>Post-Famine Diet In pre-Famine Ireland, fish was seen as a luxury by those who did not live by the sea. It was eaten with bread or potatoes. When the blight struck the potato crops, people stopped eating fish as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-workhouses>What happened to the workhouses?</h2>
<p>The workhouse system was abolished in the UK by the same Act on 1 April 1930, but many workhouses, renamed Public Assistance Institutions, continued under the control of local county councils. The 1948 National Assistance Act abolished the last vestiges of the Poor Law, and with it the workhouses.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-eat-on-the-coffin-ships>What did people eat on the coffin ships?</h2>
<p>The ship was 83 years old, having been built in 1763 for a legal maximum passenger load of 165 but it set sail with 276 who had to share just 36 berths. No food was given to the passengers on the voyage. They had to survive on what little (if anything) they had brought onboard.</p>

<p>Soup kitchens were set up in all but three of Ireland’s 130 Poor Law Unions and the rations were being given to 780,000 people by May. By the start of June, this number had increased to 2,700,000. At their peak, in mid August, over three million people were being fed daily by the scheme.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-soup-made-in-the-irish-famine>Where was the soup made in the Irish Famine?</h2>
<p>Soup was cooked in large cast iron cauldrons which have come to be known as famine pots, soup boilers or workhouse pots. These durable pots were made in a Quaker iron foundry owned and run by the Darby family in Coalbrooke in the Severn Valley of England. Famine Pot, Nenagh, County Tipperary</p>

<p>It was designed to provide directly cooked food or soup as a form of relief and it was to be given freely to the people. Soup kitchens were to be established in each workhouse district or electoral division. It was in operation from June to September during the summer of 1847. There were to be no preferences on religious grounds.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-work-house-during-the-irish-famine>Where was the work house during the Irish Famine?</h2>
<p>For example, a work house in Fermoy, County Cork built for 800 people, actually kept 1,800 people in very bad conditions. Diseases spread very quickly in overcrowded spaces. By the end of the famine, there were 163 workhouses in Ireland.</p>
