<h2 id=what-factors-contributed-to-the-ferocity-of-the-japanese-resistance-to-american-forces-on-saipan-iwo-jima-and-okinawa>What factors contributed to the ferocity of the Japanese resistance to American forces on Saipan Iwo Jima and Okinawa?</h2>
<p>– Some factors that contributed to the ferocity of Japanese resistance was their motto of death over dishonor. – Also “Bushido” – to surrender was to break the bonds of duty and obligation that linked the soldier to his emperor and family. – In other words, they would rather die than surrender.</p>
<h2 id=what-ended-the-war-between-us-and-japan>What ended the war between US and Japan?</h2>
<p>When the Japanese attack the American fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, the United States enters World War II and goes to war with Japan; the war ends when the U.S. drops atomic bombs on Hiroshima (August 6) and Nagasaki (August 9) in Japan in 1945 and Japan surrenders unconditionally to the Allied …</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-end-the-japanese-war>How did the US end the Japanese War?</h2>
<p>The United States and the Japanese War. In June 1945, after eighty days of fighting and tens of thousands of casualties, the Americans captured the island of Okinawa. The mainland of Japan was open before them. It was a viable base from which to launch a full invasion of the Japanese homeland and end the war.</p>

<p>American fire bombs killed 100,000 civilians in Tokyo in March 1945. In June 1945, after eighty days of fighting and tens of thousands of casualties, the Americans captured the island of Okinawa. The mainland of Japan was open before them. It was a viable base from which to launch a full invasion of the Japanese homeland and end the war.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-us-role-in-the-pacific-war>What was the US role in the Pacific War?</h2>
<p>As Americans celebrated “V.E.” (Victory in Europe) Day, they redirected their full attention to the still-raging Pacific War. As in Europe, the war in the Pacific started slowly. After Pearl Harbor, the American-controlled Philippine archipelago fell to Japan.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-battle-of-coral-sea>What was the outcome of the Battle of Coral Sea?</h2>
<p>But as Americans mobilized their armed forces, the tide turned. In the summer of 1942, American naval victories at the Battle of the Coral Sea Coral Sea and the aircraft carrier duel at the Battle of Midway crippled Japan’s Pacific naval operations.</p>
