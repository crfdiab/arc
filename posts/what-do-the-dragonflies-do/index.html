<h2 id=what-do-the-dragonflies-do>What do the dragonflies do?</h2>
<p>The dragonfly does an amazing job of helping humans by controlling populations of pest insects, especially those that bug us most, such as mosquitoes and biting flies. A single dragonfly can reportedly eat anywhere from 30 to hundreds of mosquitoes per day.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-dragonflies-do-to-humans>What does dragonflies do to humans?</h2>
<p>Dragonflies aren’t an aggressive insect, but they can bite out of self-defense when they feel threatened. The bite isn’t dangerous, and in most cases, it won’t break human skin.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-dragonflies-rest>Why do dragonflies rest?</h2>
<p>Since they are a bit vulnerable, they will tend to seek shelter and camouflage for their resting place. You can often find them among tall grasses or under leaves near water sources while resting. The adult dragonfly has begun, though, its short life expectancy as an adult.</p>
<h2 id=do-dragonflies-carry-diseases>Do dragonflies carry diseases?</h2>
<p>Unlike many other insects, they do not damage crops or spread diseases, says Christine Lewis, director of education at the Virginia Living Museum in southeastern Virginia. Despite their intimidating size, dragonflies are harmless to humans.</p>
<h2 id=what-attracts-dragonflies-to-your-yard>What attracts dragonflies to your yard?</h2>
<p>If you want to attract dragonflies to your yard, the best lure is a body of water. Dragonflies lay eggs in or near water, where their young hatch and develop into nymphs. They live underwater for months and sometimes years before emerging as adults.</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-eat-dragonflies>What animals eat dragonflies?</h2>
<p>Who eats them? Just about everything. Birds, especially the more acrobatic fliers such as flycatchers, swallows, kingfishers, falcons and kites, eat countless dragonflies, while spiders, praying mantids, robber flies and even early-emerging bats will dine on dragonflies as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-a-dragonfly-flies-around-you>What does it mean when a dragonfly flies around you?</h2>
<p>Meaning of a Dragonfly Flying Around You A dragonfly hovering around you generally means that change is about to enter your life. It also represents freedom from captivity or the onset of freedom of opinion and uniqueness in your life. Interestingly, Vietnamese culture links flying dragonflies to changes in weather.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-insect-will-eat-a-dragonfly>What kind of insect will eat a dragonfly?</h2>
<p>Even though the dragonfly will prey on horseflies, mosquitoes, and other insects, it also has its own enemies. Adult dragonflies can be eaten by larger dragonflies, spiders, birds, and frogs. In the larval stage, its enemies include frogs, toads, and fish. Dragonflies are more than agile flyers.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-dragonfly-and-a-damselfly>What’s the difference between a dragonfly and a damselfly?</h2>
<p>The difference between each one is that a dragonfly holds its wings to the side while landed, while a damselfly will hold up its wings on its back. Dragonflies are more territorial than damselflies while mating and males may fight eachother to the death, while damselflies communicate with displays to find a mate.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-dragonflies-so-important-to-the-environment>Why are dragonflies so important to the environment?</h2>
<p>Interestingly, dragonflies are important to the environment. Dragonflies mostly feed on mosquitoes and other insects, so they do an excellent job of reducing mosquito populations around homes. Dragonflies can eat hundreds of mosquitoes each day.</p>
