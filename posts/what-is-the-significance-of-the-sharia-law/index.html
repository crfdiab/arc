<h2 id=what-is-the-significance-of-the-sharia-law>What is the significance of the Sharia law?</h2>
<p>Sharia literally means “the clear, well-trodden path to water”. Sharia law acts as a code for living that all Muslims should adhere to, including prayers, fasting and donations to the poor. It aims to help Muslims understand how they should lead every aspect of their lives according to God’s wishes.</p>
<h2 id=is-saudi-arabia-based-on-islamic-law>Is Saudi Arabia based on Islamic law?</h2>
<p>The legal system of Saudi Arabia is based on Sharia, Islamic law derived from the Qur’an and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The sources of Sharia also include Islamic scholarly consensus developed after Muhammad’s death.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-sharia-law-and-how-is-it-different-from-western-law>What is Sharia law and how is it different from Western law?</h2>
<p>The Sharīʿah is thus not merely a system of law but also a comprehensive code of behaviour that embraces both private and public activities. The second major distinction between the Sharīʿah and Western legal systems is a consequence of the Islamic concept of the law as the expression of the divine will.</p>

Governance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is based on justice, shura (consultation) and equality according to Islamic Sharia.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-law-come-from-in-saudi-arabia>Where does the law come from in Saudi Arabia?</h2>
