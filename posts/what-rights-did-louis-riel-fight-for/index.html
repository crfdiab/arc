<h2 id=what-rights-did-louis-riel-fight-for>What Rights did Louis Riel fight for?</h2>
<p>He led two resistance movements against the government of Canada and its first prime minister, John A. Macdonald. Riel sought to defend Métis rights and identity as the Northwest Territories came progressively under the Canadian sphere of influence.</p>
<h2 id=who-made-the-metis-bill-of-rights>Who made the Metis Bill of Rights?</h2>
<p>Riel<br>
Riel wrote the Métis “Revolutionary Bill of Rights” which advocated for land title for Métis families, provincial status for Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Red River, and better treatment for Indigenous peoples.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-on-the-métis-bill-of-rights>What was on the Métis Bill of Rights?</h2>
<p>It allowed the Métis to have rights to have denominational schools. The act stated that laws had to be written and enforced in both French and English, either English or French can be used in the Legislature of Manitoba and any courts established by either Canada or the Province must use both languages.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-included-in-the-list-of-rights>What was included in the list of Rights?</h2>
<p>In part, the List of Rights included such provisions as: and all sheriffs, magistrates, constables, and school commissioners will be elected by the people. A group of transplanted Loyalists saw this list as evidence of sedition and they had the ear of the Government of Canada, which procrastinated in accepting the List of Rights.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-louis-david-riel-born-and-raised>Where was Louis David Riel born and raised?</h2>
<p>Louis David Riel was born near what is now Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, on October 22, 1844.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-author-of-the-bill-of-rights>Who was the author of the Bill of Rights?</h2>
<p>The Bill of Rights was prepared at a “Convention of Forty” (20 English-speakers and 20 French-speakers) convened on January 26, 1870 to replace the List of Rights which had not been adequately debated. It was written by Louis Riel, Louis Schmidt, Charles Nolin, James Ross, Thomas Bunn, and Dr. Curtis Bird in just 2 days.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-jacques-riel-committed-to-two-asylums>Why was Jacques Riel committed to two asylums?</h2>
<p>By that point, Riel was undergoing a personal transformation in which he increasingly viewed himself as the steward for God’s chosen people and a new Christianity based in Métis homeland. Frightened by his emotional outbursts and claims of holy visions, Riel’s friends had him committed to a pair of asylums.</p>
