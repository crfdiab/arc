<h2 id=what-was-egypt-original-name>What was Egypt original name?</h2>
<p>Kemet<br>
A popular ancient name for Egypt was “Kemet,” which means the “black land.” Scholars generally believe that this name derives from the fertile soil that is left over when the Nile flood recedes in August.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-kemet-changed-to-egypt>Why was Kemet changed to Egypt?</h2>
<p>The Egyptians called their country Kemet, literally the “Black Land” (kem meant “black” in ancient Egyptian). The name derived from the colour of the rich and fertile black soil which was due to the annually occurring Nile inundation. It became “Aiguptos” in Greek and this then led to “Egypt” in English.</p>
<h2 id=who-changed-the-name-kemet-to-egypt>Who changed the name Kemet to Egypt?</h2>
<p>The rich black soil of the Nile Valley gave Egypt it’s ancient name “Kemet” or “Black Land”. The conquest of Egypt by the Greeks resulted in their mispronouncing their capital city Memphis, or Hwt-Ka-Ptah (Mansion of the spirit of Ptah) which the Greeks heard as “Aegyptos” which ultimately turned into Egypt.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-egypt-called-before-it-was-named-egypt>What was Egypt called before it was named Egypt?</h2>
<p>Actually it is not. You will be amazed by the multiple appellations for the ancient land of the Nile Valley, scholars of Ancient Egyptian history will provide you when you ask the question. They say that ancient Egypt was once called KMT, but then again they would add that appellations like, Tawy/Ta3wy and Tomry/Ta-Mert were not uncommon.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-first-capital-of-upper-egypt>Which is the first capital of Upper Egypt?</h2>
<p>This is a list of Egyptian capitals in a chronological order. Thinis (Actual Location Unknown) (before 2950 BC) the first capital of Upper and Lower Egypt. Memphis: (2950 BC – 2180 BC) – I – VIII dynasties. Herakleopolis Magna: (2180 BC – 2060 BC) – IX and X dynasties. Thebes: (2135 BC – 1985 BC) – XI dynasty.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-god-of-egypt>What was the name of the god of Egypt?</h2>
<p>Egypt was sometimes called by the name of the sixth or twelfth month of its calendar, namely (Mshiru, Masuri) and the first meaning (the god of the whirlwinds).</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-seat-of-ancient-egyptian-civilization>Where was the seat of ancient Egyptian civilization?</h2>
<p>Egypt was the seat of the ancient Egyptian civilization, one of the most advanced civilzations of its time. Egypt’s ancient civilization was built along the Nile River. Egypt is transcontinental nation spanning from the northern region of Africa all the way to the southwest of Asia via a bridge in the form of the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
