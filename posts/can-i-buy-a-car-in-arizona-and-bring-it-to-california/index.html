<h2 id=can-i-buy-a-car-in-arizona-and-bring-it-to-california>Can I buy a car in Arizona and bring it to California?</h2>
<p>The only thing you have to be concerned with is transporting the car across state lines back to California with a temporary plate. You also have to have insurance on the prospective car—get the VIN# and send to your insurance so they will issue you an ID card. Check Arizona DMV re temporary plate.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-have-to-pay-sales-tax-on-my-car-when-i-move-to-california>Do I have to pay sales tax on my car when I move to California?</h2>
<p>If you are establishing California residency you will have to pay title transfer and registration fees to the CA DMV, not sales tax.</p>
<h2 id=does-california-charge-sales-tax-on-out-of-state-car-purchases>Does California charge sales tax on out-of-state car purchases?</h2>
<p>Sales to Out-of-State Purchasers are generally exempt from DMV fees and Sales Tax provided there is proof the delivery did occur outside of California. You must arrange the transportation and keep documentation (a shipping invoice, tow bill, bill of lading, etc.) to prove the vehicle left California.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-cheaper-to-buy-a-car-in-texas-or-california>Is it cheaper to buy a car in Texas or California?</h2>
<p>That should be a no-brainer. Buy the car in Texas. If you buy it in California, you will probably pay higher sales tax, and you’ll pay a much higher registration fee. California car registration has a component which is based on the value of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Buying a Vehicle From Out of State – Can You Register It in California? If you are a California resident and acquire a new car, truck, or motorcycle from another state, it must be certified to meet California smog laws to be registered in California.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-sell-my-car-for-1-in-california>Can I sell my car for $1 in California?</h2>
<p>You can sell a car in any state in the Union for $1.00, though it will throw up red flags to the government when you go to register it. They may not believe that you bought the car for $1 and simply wrote down that you bought it for $1 to get out of paying heavy sales taxes.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-california-sales-tax-on-a-used-car>How much is California sales tax on a used car?</h2>
<p>When you’re purchasing a new or used car, it’s important to understand the taxes and fees you may face. California statewide sales tax on new & used vehicles is 7.25%. The sales tax is higher in many areas due to district taxes. Some areas have more than one district tax, pushing sales taxes up even more.</p>

<p>, and will pay no state or county tax. For nonresidents from all other states with a higher state tax rate than Arizona’s 5.6 percent TPT rate and allow credit against their state excise taxes for the state tax paid in Arizona, the state TPT and all local taxes apply to the sale if the nonresident takes delivery of the vehicle in Arizona.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-pay-sales-tax-on-used-cars-in-california>Do you have to pay sales tax on used cars in California?</h2>
<p>If you buy a used car from a private party sale in California, you may have to pay a “use tax.”. A use tax is similar to a sales tax and collected for the use, storage or consumption of personal property (including vehicles) in California. You can calculate your local use tax rate here.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-nonresident-buy-a-car-in-arizona>Can a nonresident buy a car in Arizona?</h2>
<p>Overall, Arizona statute provides an exemption for the sale of a motor vehicle to a nonresident who is from a state that has both: a state use tax or other excise tax rate (applicable to vehicle purchases or registrations) that is lower than Arizona’s 5.6 percent state transaction privilege tax rate; and,</p>

<p>However, some states such as Alaska, New Hampshire and Delaware don’t charge sales tax on car purchases in general, while Oregon charges a small use tax just when you’re buying a car out of state. On top of any state sales tax, you’ll need to add the county portion, if required, to know how much to bring for registration.</p>
