<h2 id=what-are-the-internal-and-external-forces-which-sculpt-the-surface-of-the-earth>What are the internal and external forces which sculpt the surface of the earth?</h2>
<p>Answer: INTERNAL FORCES WORK BELOW THE EARTH’S SURFACE VOLCANISM AND MOVEMENTS THAT BEND, FOLD OR LIFT THE CRUST EXTERNAL FORCES WORK ON THE EARTH’S SURFACE WEATHERING AND EROSION IT IS ON THE OUTER LAYER OR CRUST OF THE EARTH WHERE LANDFORMS DEVELOP THAT ARE CREATED BY THESE INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL FORCES.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-external-and-internal-forces-shape-the-features-of-earth-surface>How do external and internal forces shape the features of Earth surface?</h2>
<p>Wind, water, and ice erode and shape the land. Volcanic activity and earthquakes alter the landscape in a dramatic and often violent manner. And on a much longer timescale, the movement of earth’s plates slowly reconfigures oceans and continents. Each one of these processes plays a role in the Arctic and Antarctica.</p>
<h2 id=what-forces-build-up-features-on-earths-surface>What forces build up features on Earth’s surface?</h2>
<p>Constructive Forces build up features on the surface of the Earth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sediment (Deltas, sand dunes, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tectonic Plates Colliding (Mountains)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crust deformation (Folding or Faulting)</p>

<h2 id=volcanoes-makes-islands-what-are-external-forces-examples>Volcanoes (makes Islands) What are external forces examples?</h2>
<p>Examples of external forces include dead loads, such as the weight of the structure itself and the non-structural materials it supports, and live loads, which include moving loads, such as occupants, goods, and furniture, as well as wind loads, seismic loads, and impact loads, among others.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-external-forces>What are some external forces?</h2>
<p>For our purposes, we will simply say that external forces include the applied force, normal force, tension force, friction force, and air resistance force. And for our purposes, the internal forces include the gravity forces, magnetic force, electrical force, and spring force.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-internal-and-external-forces-shape-the-earth>How are internal and external forces shape the Earth?</h2>
<p>Internal and external forces that shape the earth. Volcanoes are caused when magma rises to the vent blowing smoke while holding in all the pressure and eventually it explodes Hot Lava! removes soil and rock from one location on the Earth and, then transporting it to another location.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-processes-that-shape-the-surface-of-the-earth>What are the processes that shape the surface of the Earth?</h2>
<p>Pete currently teaches middle school Science, college level introductory Science, and has a master’s degree in Environmental Education. There are many geologic processes that shape the surface of the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-scientists-able-to-describe-the-interior-of-the-earth>How are scientists able to describe the interior of the Earth?</h2>
<p>Using information about the arrival and behavior of the waves, scientists can deduce a picture of the different layers of the Earth’s interior. This is how scientists have developed a 5-layer model of the Earth consisting of a solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a liquid mantle, a taffy-like upper layer, all underneath the outer crust.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-external-and-internal-forces-related-to-each-other>How are external and internal forces related to each other?</h2>
<p>The author describes the forces of nature that shape the landmarks on the earth’s surface: external forces and internal forces. The mechanism of their action is quite different from each other, and both have played a part in the formation of the features of the earth as are known today. …</p>
