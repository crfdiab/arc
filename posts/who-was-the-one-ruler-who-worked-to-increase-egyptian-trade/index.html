<h2 id=did-the-egyptians-expand-trade>Did the Egyptians expand trade?</h2>
<p>When the Egyptians explored south along the Nile, they found the riches of Nubia. This land had other natural resources, such as gold mines and cattle. After the Egyptians conquered Nubia, they expanded trade to other parts of Africa.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-ruler-in-egypt>Who was the first ruler in Egypt?</h2>
<p>Menes<br>
Menes, also spelled Mena, Meni, or Min, (flourished c. 2925 bce), legendary first king of unified Egypt, who, according to tradition, joined Upper and Lower Egypt in a single centralized monarchy and established ancient Egypt’s 1st dynasty.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-trade-routes-of-ancient-egypt>What were the trade routes of ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Economy and Trade. The ancient Egyptians were wonderful traders. They traded gold, papyrus, linen, and grain for cedar wood, ebony, copper, iron, ivory, and lapis lazuli (a lovely blue gem stone.) Ships sailed up and down the Nile River, bringing goods to various ports.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-trade-begin-in-ancient-egypt>When did the first trade begin in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Trade began in the Predynastic Period in Egypt (c. 6000 – c. 3150 BCE) and continued through Roman Egypt (30 BCE-646 CE). For most of its history, ancient Egypt’s economy operated on a barter system without cash. It was not until the Persian Invasion of 525 BCE that a cash economy was instituted in the country.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-route-of-trade-between-nubia-and-egypt>What was the route of trade between Nubia and Egypt?</h2>
<p>Described by Herodotus as a road “traversed in forty days,” it became by his time an important land route facilitating trade between Nubia and Egypt. Its maximum extent was northward from Kobbei, 25 miles north of al-Fashir, passing through the desert, through Bir Natrum and Wadi Howar, and ending in Egypt.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-sea-route-important-to-ancient-egypt>Why was the sea route important to ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>The sea route existed because of the huge water body Nile. The sea route was such that it extended to the eastern Mediterranean Sea. This is how the Ancient Egyptian Trade was extended even overseas.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-trade-routes-in-ancient-history>Where are the trade routes in ancient history?</h2>
<p>Trade routes have popped up throughout ancient history, stitching places of production to places of commerce.</p>
