<h2 id=what-is-a-robin-hood-roundabout>What is a Robin Hood Roundabout?</h2>
<p>The Robin Hood Roundabout is a roundabout in Newbury where the former A34 crosses the A4. The junction started as split between London Road and Shaw Road, at what was then the edge of Newbury. The roundabout was built in the mid-1960s in the first effort to build a bypass of Newbury.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-robin-hood>What happened Robin Hood?</h2>
<p>The prioress treacherously lets out too much blood, killing him, or her lover Sir Roger of Doncaster stabs him while he’s weak, in revenge for Robin’s family having inherited his land and title. Robin Hood claims some consolation, though, in that he mortally wounds Roger prior to his own demise.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-approach-a-roundabout-when-driving>How do you approach a roundabout when driving?</h2>
<p>On approach to the roundabout:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check your mirrors.</li>
<li>Keep left.</li>
<li>Signal left.</li>
<li>Approach carefully, looking to your right and ahead.</li>
<li>Once you have an opportunity to your right, go and keep left.</li>
<li>Keep your signal on to inform other road users that you’re leaving the roundabout.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id=what-gear-should-you-go-around-a-roundabout>What gear should you go around a roundabout?</h2>
<p>As another general rule if the roundabout is clear you would normally select 3rd gear and if it’s looking busy then slow down a bit more and go into 2nd gear. If you know you will have to stop then you can wait till you get closer to the roundabout and then go into 1st gear.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-indicate-when-going-straight-on-at-a-mini-roundabout>Do you indicate when going straight on at a mini roundabout?</h2>
<p>As with normal roundabouts, if turning left or right at a mini-roundabout, an indication must be applied. On normal roundabouts, vehicles frequently do not indicate, on mini-roundabouts, however, vehicles usually indicate, especially if they intend on turning right.</p>
