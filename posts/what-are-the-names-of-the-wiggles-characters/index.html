<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-wiggles-characters>What are the names of the Wiggles characters?</h2>
<p>The current Wiggles line-up includes Anthony Field (The Blue Wiggle), Emma Watkins (The Yellow Wiggle), Lachy Gillespie (The Purple Wiggle), and Simon Pryce (The Red Wiggle), who have been recording and performing together since 2013.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-wiggles-are-dead>How many Wiggles are dead?</h2>
<p>Today marks the end of an era. The remaining three original members of The Wiggles are leaving the group after 21 years. The grind of touring had become too much for Jeff Fatt, Murray Cook and Greg Page, the red, purple and blue shirts behind the No. 2 top Australian entertainers, earning $28.2 million last year.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-wiggles-have-there-been>How many Wiggles have there been?</h2>
<p>The children’s music group, that was originally comprised of Greg Page (Yellow Wiggle), Murray Cook (Red Wiggle), Jeff Fatt (Purple Wiggle), and Anthony Field (Blue Wiggle), entertained viewers on screens between 1998 until 2017 — when three of the band members retired and were replaced.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-oldest-wiggle>Who is the oldest Wiggle?</h2>
<p>Jeff Fatt<br>
He says Murray Cook, 52, and Jeff Fatt, at 59 the oldest Wiggle, decided it was time to retire and spend more time with their families.</p>
<h2 id=does-emma-watkins-have-a-child>Does Emma Watkins have a child?</h2>
<p>The pair are the proud parents to six-month-old twin daughters, Lulu and Lottie, and announced their engagement in April last year.</p>

<p>We are extremely saddened by the death of Phil Hughes. May he rest in peace. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and team mates.</p>

Emma Watkins/Husband</p>
<p>Yellow Wiggle Emma Watkins announces engagement to bandmate Oliver Brian. Three years after her marriage to Purple Wiggle Lachlan Gillespie ended, Emma Watkins has announced her engagement to fellow bandmate Oliver Brian.</p>
<h2 id=does-emma-the-yellow-wiggle-wear-a-wig>Does Emma the Yellow Wiggle wear a wig?</h2>
<p>“I’m about to confirm that I do wear a wig in The Wiggles show,” Emma explained in a video titled The Wiggles’ Emma Watkins’ Entire Routine, from Waking Up to Showtime, which has been viewed more than 1.4 million times online. “So yes, I do wear a wig. And I don’t just have one, I’ve got about four wigs now.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-wiggles-and-what-are-their-names>Who are The Wiggles and what are their names?</h2>
<p>After the production of their second album, The Wiggles, who were called by their first names when they performed, began to wear costumes on stage as Fabinyi suggested and as The Cockroaches had done, and adopted colour-coded shirts: Greg in yellow, Murray in red, Jeff in purple, and Anthony in blue.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-wiggles-still-in-the-band>Who are The Wiggles still in the band?</h2>
<p>Anthony is the enduring Wiggle. The only original still in the line-up… The OG. He’s been wearing the blue skivvy for almost 30 years. Anthony has been open about his battles with mental illness, including depression, throughout his time with the group.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-shows-did-the-wiggles-do-in-one-year>How many shows did The Wiggles do in one year?</h2>
<p>Eventually, this increased to two titles per year and even more. Greg recalls that in 1994 in one tour The Wiggles performed 63 shows in 17 days, with only one day off in that period. The original Big Red Car video featured a Big Red Car made of plywood, held up on plastic milk crates and constructed by Jeff!</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-colour-of-the-wiggle-time-video>What was the colour of the Wiggle Time video?</h2>
<p>They all travelled into a Sydney department store and each picked out a colour, Murray red, Jeff purple, Greg yellow and Anthony initially picked a green shirt (a few years later Anthony changed his colour to blue as Dorothy was green). The Wiggle Time video shoot was a “do it yourself” affair as the lack of funds dictated.</p>
