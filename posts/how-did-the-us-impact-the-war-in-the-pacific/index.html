<h2 id=how-did-the-us-impact-the-war-in-the-pacific>How did the US impact the war in the Pacific?</h2>
<p>It was the first time that Allied forces were able to make headway in the Pacific. In August 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As a result, approximately 120,000 civilians died. Japan formally surrendered in September 1945.</p>
<h2 id=what-difficulties-did-the-us-face-while-fighting-in-the-pacific-theater>What difficulties did the US face while fighting in the Pacific theater?</h2>
<p>What difficulties did the U.S. face when delivering weapons, food, and medical supplies to its troops in the Pacific Theater? There were huge demands on shipping due to the fact that all supplies had to be moved by sea to many distant islands, and it was difficult to protect supply ships across the vast Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-american-strategy-in-the-pacific>What was the American strategy in the Pacific?</h2>
<p>Leapfrogging, also known as island hopping, was a military strategy employed by the Allies in the Pacific War against the Empire of Japan during World War II. The key idea is to bypass heavily fortified enemy islands instead of trying to capture every island in sequence en route to a final target.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-war-in-the-pacific-so-brutal>Why was the war in the Pacific so brutal?</h2>
<p>Every war is brutal, but especially the war in the Pacific, because here ancient hostilities between yellow and other races focused together in unnecessary killing of civilians and prisoners. For the Japanese soldiers a white man was something of a mystic monster against which his emperor led a holy war.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-turning-point-of-the-war-in-the-pacific>What was the turning point of the war in the Pacific?</h2>
<p>Though the June 1942 Battle of Midway is often seen as the turning point of the war in the Pacific, the Solomon Islands campaign, including the Battle of Guadalcanal, was equally pivotal.</p>
<h2 id=how-bad-was-the-war-in-the-pacific>How bad was the war in the Pacific?</h2>
<p>Almost overnight, some 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were locked up purely for their heritage. By the end of the Pacific War, the Japanese would sustain the second most casualties, with over one million soldiers killed or missing.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-situation-in-the-pacific-in-1942>What was the situation in the Pacific in 1942?</h2>
<p>Throughout the winter and spring of 1942 the war news reaching the United States from the Pacific was grim. The Japanese amassed a vast new empire with a defensive perimeter that ranged from western Alaska to the Solomon Islands.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-turning-point-in-the-pacific-war>What was the turning point in the Pacific War?</h2>
<p>The turning point in the Pacific war came with the American naval victory in the Battle of Midway in June 1942. The Japanese fleet sustained heavy losses and was turned back. In August 1942, American forces attacked the Japanese in the Solomon Islands, forcing a costly withdrawal of Japanese forces from the island of Guadalcanal in February 1943.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-island-hopping-in-the-pacific-war>What was the result of island hopping in the Pacific War?</h2>
<p>The result of island hopping was a chain of established bases while the result of leapfrogging was subduing certain strategically important islands while destroying military bases on other islands and thus isolating them in the process. Each of the strategies had its advantaged and was employed in the Pacific War.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-rabaul-important-to-the-war-in-the-pacific>Why was Rabaul important to the war in the Pacific?</h2>
<p>Thus, troops on islands that had been bypassed, such as the major base at Rabaul, were useless to the Japanese war effort and left to “wither on the vine.” MacArthur greatly supported this strategy in his effort to regain the Philippines. It began to be implemented in late 1943 in Operation Cartwheel.</p>
