<p>Andy Jarosz, a travel writer who has just returned from Jordan, reported seeing very few other tourists around Petra.

<p>Petra is the Center of Jordan’s Tourism Similarly, Petra is the focal point for tourism in Jordan, as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The Jordanian government has a huge vested interest in ensuring that the site is kept safe. There is a large security presence in Jordan, with a well-trained army.</p>
<h2 id=are-tourist-allowed-in-petra>Are tourist allowed in Petra?</h2>
<p>You can only enter Petra by buying tickets at the Petra visitors’ centre in Wadi Musa, the closest town. Once you’re at the site (2km from visitors’ centre), you enter through a rocky passage with very high walls called the Siq – you can do this on foot, or on horseback (horses are hired from the visitor centre).</p>

<h2 id=can-you-wear-shorts-in-petra>Can you wear shorts in Petra?</h2>
<p>Whether you are in the city of Amman, exploring Petra or trekking the desert men should refrain from wearing shorts as it is seen as disrespectful. This rule applies to both men and women so always wear shirts and t-shirts that cover the top of the arms.</p>

<p>Sitting on top of a serrated mountain is another beautiful temple called The Monastery. Its 800-step trail will beat every Stairmaster known to man – but the cardio run is worth it. Can you imagine that these paths have been there since 400 B.C.?</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-bring-to-the-city-of-petra>What should I bring to the city of Petra?</h2>
<p>The city of Petra is surrounded by a number of cliffs that visitors can easily climb up to. It is best to bring reliable hiking boots if you plan to visit as a lot of walking has to be done. When there is a lot of climbing, there should be a lot of drinking too – of water, that is.</p>

<p>There’s still a lot to see in Petra and the anticipation only grows as to what scholars will discover next in this marvellous ancient city. Jihan is a neo-Vancouverite who is enjoying discovering her new “hometown”.</p>
