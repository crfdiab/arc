<h2 id=what-factors-did-the-independence-movements-in-africa>What factors did the independence movements in Africa?</h2>
<p>Attracted by the promise of wealth from gold, diamonds, exotic hardwoods, and other natural riches, European nations claimed large portions of Africa for their colonial empires. Besides seizing the land of Africans, the Europeans also destroyed many of their freedoms and their institutions of government.</p>
<h2 id=which-african-countries-were-still-independent-by-the-early-20th-century>Which African countries were still independent by the early 20th century?</h2>
<p>As the century opened, only two countries in Africa, Ethiopia and Liberia, had independent governments; the rest of the continent was run by European governments and companies.</p>
<h2 id=in-what-20-year-period-did-most-african-countries-achieve-independence>In what 20 year period did most African countries achieve independence?</h2>
<p>The decolonisation of Africa took place in the mid-to-late 1950s to 1975, with radical regime changes on the continent as colonial governments made the transition to independent states.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-nationalism-fuel-the-independence-movement-in-africa-in-the-20th-century>How did nationalism fuel the independence movement in Africa in the 20th century?</h2>
<p>This surge in African nationalism was fueled by several catalytic factors besides the oppressive colonial experience itself: missionary churches, World Wars I and II, the ideology of Pan-Africanism, and the League of Nations/United Nations. Each of these factors will now be discussed.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-west-africa-gain-independence-from-france>How did West Africa gain independence from France?</h2>
<p>On September 28, 1958, in a referendum, the colonies were offered full internal self-government as fellow members with France of a French Community that would deal with supranational affairs. All of the colonies voted for this scheme except Guinea, where Sékou Touré led the people to vote for complete independence.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-in-control-of-south-africa-before-the-british>Who was in control of South Africa before the British?</h2>
<p>Increased European encroachment ultimately led to the colonisation and occupation of South Africa by the Dutch. The Cape Colony remained under Dutch rule until 1795 before it fell to the British Crown, before reverting back to Dutch Rule in 1803 and again to British occupation in 1806.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-independence-movement-start-in-africa>When did the independence movement start in Africa?</h2>
<p>Independence Movements Between 1957 and 1993 nearly 50 African states achieved independence from colonial rule. The first sparks of resistance to foreign control took shape much earlier, though, in some cases hundreds of years earlier. Independence movements developed throughout Africa in the mid-1900s.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-south-africa-become-an-independent-country>When did South Africa become an independent country?</h2>
<p>Here are the dates of independence for African nations. Country. Independence Date. Prior ruling country. Liberia, Republic of. July 26, 1847. -. South Africa, Republic of. May 31, 1910.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-north-africa-like-in-the-20th-century>What was North Africa like in the 20th century?</h2>
<p>Five North African countries – Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Tunisia and Morocco – were already independent, but Ghana’s independence and Nkrumah’s pan-Africanism was an electric shock that ended 60-years of domination masquerading as helpfulness.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-independence-movement-in-angola>Who was involved in the independence movement in Angola?</h2>
<p>In Angola the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) adopted communist principles and had support from the Soviet Union and Cuba. Meanwhile, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) received backing from SOUTH AFRICA, the United States, and other Western powers.</p>
