<p>Canada is made up of various provinces such as Manitoba, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia with their own unique traits however; Quebec seems to be the only province which demands a distinction. If Quebec were to become independent there would be major implications.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-separatist-movement-in-quebec-important>Why was the separatist movement in Quebec important?</h2>
<p>Quebec Separatist Movement The Canadian confederation brought promise and opportunity to a newly independent nation, this nation consisted of Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Quebec. As the only province in Canada with a French speaking minority Quebec faced discrimination and anguish.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-for-quebec-to-separate-from-canada>Is it possible for Quebec to separate from Canada?</h2>
<p>If Quebec were to separate, then they would be able to sustain themselves economically. It would be difficult severing all economic ties with Canada, including the dollar; however with time and the large work force that Quebec has it would not take long for them to create revenue.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-separatist-referendum-in-canada>What was the result of the separatist referendum in Canada?</h2>
<p>The sovereignists lost very narrowly in the October 30 referendum, 49.4 per cent to 50.6 per cent, but won a substantial majority among francophone voters. Parizeau resigned after shocking the general public by attributing the referendum defeat to “money and the ethnic vote.” He was replaced as premier by Lucien Bouchard.</p>
