<h2 id=when-did-tambora-first-erupt>When did Tambora first erupt?</h2>
<p>April 5, 1815<br>
Hear this out loudPauseThe eruption of Mount Tambora, which began on April 5, 1815, devastated much of the island of Sumbawa and the surrounding region and influenced weather across the globe.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-mt-tambora-erupt-for>How long did Mt Tambora erupt for?</h2>
<p>one to three years<br>
Hear this out loudPauseIn much of the Northern Hemisphere, though, there prevailed “rather sudden and often extreme changes in surface weather after the eruption of Tambora, lasting from one to three years,” according to a 1992 collection of scientific studies titled The Year Without a Summer?: World Climate in 1816.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-1815-eruption-of-mount-tambora>What caused the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseThe Tambora eruption was caused by ocean water penetrating cracks and fissures in the mountain. When it reacted with magma deep inside the volcano, massive pressure built up, causing the mountain to blow itself apart. In 1812, the mountain began to emit small amounts of ash and steam.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-eruption-of-mt-tambora-in-1815>Where was the eruption of Mt Tambora in 1815?</h2>
<p>Mt. Tambora, on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa, exploded the world into a new era when it erupted 200 years ago. It shook the world in many ways, some you won’t believe. Here are 12 Incredible facts about the 1815 eruption of Tambora…</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-peak-of-mount-tambora>How tall is the peak of Mount Tambora?</h2>
<p>Mount Tambora. Written By: Mount Tambora, also called Mount Tamboro, Indonesian Gunung Tambora, volcanic mountain on the northern coast of Sumbawa island, Indonesia, that in April 1815 exploded in the largest volcanic eruption in recorded history. It is now 2,851 metres (9,354 feet) high, having lost much of its top in the 1815 eruption.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-mount-tambora-thought-to-be-extinct>Why was Mount Tambora thought to be extinct?</h2>
<p>When the island was first discovered by Europeans, the mountain was thought to be an extinct volcano. However, about three years before the 1815 eruption, the mountain seemed to come to life. Rumblings were felt, and a dark smoky cloud appeared atop the summit.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-eruption-of-krakatoa-overshadowed-by-the-tambora-eruption>Why was the eruption of Krakatoa overshadowed by the Tambora eruption?</h2>
<p>The disaster on the remote island of Sumbawa in the Indian Ocean has been overshadowed by the eruption of the volcano at Krakatoa decades later, partly because the news of Krakatoa traveled quickly via telegraph. Accounts of the Tambora eruption were considerably rarer, yet some vivid ones do exist.</p>
