<h2 id=what-is-the-effect-of-air-pollution-on-the-environment>What is the effect of air pollution on the environment?</h2>
<p>Air pollution can damage crops and trees in a variety of ways. Ground-level ozone can lead to reductions in agricultural crop and commercial forest yields, reduced growth and survivability of tree seedlings, and increased plant susceptibility to disease, pests and other environmental stresses (such as harsh weather).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-effect-of-pollution>What is an effect of pollution?</h2>
<p>High levels of air pollution can cause an increased risk of heart attack, wheezing, coughing, and breathing problems, and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. Air pollution can also cause worsening of existing heart problems, asthma, and other lung complications.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-air-pollution-causes-and-effects>What is air pollution causes and effects?</h2>
<p>There are many associated risks to human health from air pollution. Those who are exposed to poor air quality can face an increased risk of developing or exacerbating a range of illnesses including lung and breathing problems, skin conditions, cancer and organ damage.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-effects-of-air-pollution>What are the major effects of air pollution?</h2>
<p>Long-term health effects from air pollution include heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Air pollution can also cause long-term damage to people’s nerves, brain, kidneys, liver, and other organs. Some scientists suspect air pollutants cause birth defects.</p>
<h2 id=does-pollution-reduce-the-life-of-human-beings>Does pollution reduce the life of human beings?</h2>
<p>Globally, the AQLI reveals that particulate pollution reduces average life expectancy by 1.8 years, making it the greatest global threat to human health. By comparison, first-hand cigarette smoke leads to a reduction in global average life expectancy of about 1.6 years.</p>
<h2 id=which-diseases-are-caused-by-air-pollution>Which diseases are caused by air pollution?</h2>
<p>The most common diseases caused by air pollution include ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer and acute lower respiratory infections in children. Particulate air pollution has been linked with strokes, which occur when the blood supply to the brain is cut-off.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-health-effects-of-air-pollution>What are the health effects of air pollution?</h2>
<p>The health effects of air pollution are serious – one third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease are due to air pollution. This is having an equivalent effect to that of smoking tobacco, and much higher than, say, the effects of eating too much salt.

<h2 id=which-is-the-best-definition-of-air-pollution>Which is the best definition of air pollution?</h2>
<p>DEFINITIONS Air pollution is defined as all destructive effects of any sources which contribute to the pollution of the atmosphere and/or deterioration of the ecosystem. Air pollution is caused by both human interventions and/or natural phenomena. It is made up of many kinds of pollutants including materials in solid, liquid, and gas phases.[18]</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-eye-affected-by-air-pollution>How is the eye affected by air pollution?</h2>
<p>The eye is a neglected vulnerable organ to the adverse effects of air suspended contaminants even household air pollution.[118,119] Clinical effects of air pollution on the eyes can vary from asymptomatic eye problems to dry eye syndrome.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-air-pollution-affect-plants-and-animals>How does air pollution affect plants and animals?</h2>
<p>Damage to respiratory systems is the most common effect on animals, but neurological problems and skin irritations are also common. Plants and crops grow less when exposed to long term air pollution. Ozone pollution harms plants by damaging structures called stomata, which are tiny pores on the underside of leaves that allow the plant to “breathe.”</p>
