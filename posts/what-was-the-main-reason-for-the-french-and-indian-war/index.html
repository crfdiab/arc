<h2 id=what-was-the-main-reason-for-the-french-and-indian-war>What was the main reason for the French and Indian War?</h2>
<p>What was the main cause of the French and Indian War? The French and Indian War began over the specific issue of whether the upper Ohio River valley was a part of the British Empire, and therefore open for trade and settlement by Virginians and Pennsylvanians, or part of the French Empire.</p>
<h2 id=who-won-french-indian-war>Who won French Indian War?</h2>
<p>British<br>
The British had won the French and Indian War. They took control of the lands that had been claimed by France (see below). France lost its mainland possessions to North America. Britain now claimed all the land from the east coast of North America to the Mississippi River.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-and-effect-of-the-french-and-indian-war>What was the cause and effect of the French and Indian War?</h2>
<p>The British victory in the French and Indian War had a great impact on the British Empire. Firstly, it meant a great expansion of British territorial claims in the New World. But the cost of the war had greatly enlarged Britain’s debt. The war had an equally profound but very different effect on the American colonists.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-french-and-indian-war>Who was involved in the French and Indian War?</h2>
<p>It was a conflict that pitted two of history’s greatest empires, Great Britain and France, against each other for control of the North American continent. Swept up in the struggle were the inhabitants of New France, the British colonists, the Native Americans, and regular troops from France and Britain.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-french-and-indian-war-end>When did the French and Indian War end?</h2>
<p>On February 10, 1763, over two years after the fighting had ended in North America, hostilities officially ceased with the signing of the Treaty of Paris between Britain, France, and Spain.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-british-turn-the-tide-in-the-french-and-indian-war>How did the British turn the tide in the French and Indian War?</h2>
<p>Boosted by the financing of future Prime Minister William Pitt, the British turned the tide with victories at Louisbourg, Fort Frontenac and the French-Canadian stronghold of Quebec. At the 1763 peace conference, the British received the territories of Canada from France and Florida from Spain, opening the Mississippi Valley to westward expansion.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-war-between-great-britain-and-france>What was the war between Great Britain and France?</h2>
<p>Since the late 17 th century, hostilities between France and Great Britain in North America had been continuous. Three major conflicts—King William’s War (1689-1697), Queen Anne’s War (1702-1713), and King George’s War (1744-1748)—had all begun in Europe and made their way to the colonies.</p>
