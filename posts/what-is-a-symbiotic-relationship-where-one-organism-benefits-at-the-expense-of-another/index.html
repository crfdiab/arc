<h2 id=what-is-a-symbiotic-relationship-where-one-organism-benefits-at-the-expense-of-another>What is a symbiotic relationship where one organism benefits at the expense of another?</h2>
<p>In parasitism, the organism benefits at the expense of another organism. The organism that benefits from the association is called a parasite whereas the one that does not benefit but rather harmed is called a host. Thus, in parasitism the symbiotic relationship is non-mutual.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-symbiotic-relationship-in-which-one-organism-benefits-and-the-other-is-harmed>What is a symbiotic relationship in which one organism benefits and the other is harmed?</h2>
<p>Parasitism – symbiotic relationship in which one organism benefits and the other is harmed or killed.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-symbiotic-relationship-explain>What is symbiotic relationship explain?</h2>
<p>Symbiosis is a close relationship between two species in which at least one species benefits. For the other species, the relationship may be positive, negative, or neutral. There are three basic types of symbiosis: mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-example-of-symbiotic-relationship>What is the example of symbiotic relationship?</h2>
<p>The symbiotic relationship between an anemone (Heteractis magnifica) and a clownfish (Amphiron ocellaris) is a classic example of two organisms benefiting the other; the anemone provides the clownfish with protection and shelter, while the clownfish provides the anemone nutrients in the form of waste while also scaring …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-symbiosis-give-an-example>What is symbiosis give an example?</h2>
<p>Symbiosis is the phenomenon by which two organisms maintain relationship with each other to be mutually benefitted. In symbiotic mode, organisms develop a special relationship with certain other organisms to obtain nourishment. e.g. Rhizobium bacteria and Leguminous plants are symbionts exhibiting symbiosis.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-symbiotic-relationship-between-two-or-more-species>Which is a symbiotic relationship between two or more species?</h2>
<p>A close relationship between two or more species where at least one benefits Parasitism A symbiotic relationship in which one organism benefits and the other is harmed A relationship in which one organism lives on or in a host and harms it. Mutualism A relationship in which both species benefit Predator An animal that naturally preys on others</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-host-species-benefit-from-the-symbiosis>How does the host species benefit from the symbiosis?</h2>
<p>The host species neither benefits nor is harmed from the relationship. In our imagined example, various species of barnacles attach themselves to the skin of whales. Scientists have not discovered the exact mechanism by which barnacles are able to do this, but it does not appear to bother the whales.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-symbiotic-relationships-in-the-ocean>Are there any symbiotic relationships in the ocean?</h2>
<p>From the Ocean to the human body, nature is full of symbiotic relationships. Derived from the Greek ‘sym’ and ‘bios’ translated as together and life, biologists and ecologists have researched how species interact whilst intimately living and working together. These fascinating bonds are great examples of the intricacy of natures ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-commensalism-and-amensalism-related-in-biology>How is commensalism and amensalism related in biology?</h2>
<p>Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one organism benefits but the other is neither helped nor harmed. Amensalism refers to a relationship between two species in which one of the partners is inhibited, while the other is not affected in any significant way.</p>
