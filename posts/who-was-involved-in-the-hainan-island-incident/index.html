<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-hainan-island-incident>Who was involved in the Hainan Island incident?</h2>
<p>The Hainan Island incident occurred on April 1, 2001, when a United States Navy EP-3E ARIES II signals intelligence aircraft and a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) J-8II interceptor fighter jet collided in mid-air, resulting in an international dispute between the United States of America (USA) and the People’s Republic of China (PRC).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-j-8-crash-on-hainan-island>How did the J-8 crash on Hainan Island?</h2>
<p>The J-8’s tail fin struck the EP-3’s left aileron forcing it fully upright, and causing the U.S. aircraft to roll to the left at 3–4 times its normal maximum rate. The impact sent the EP-3 into a 30° dive at a bank angle of 130°, almost inverted.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-chinese-do-on-hainan-island>What did the Chinese do on Hainan Island?</h2>
<p>The Chinese offered them water and cigarettes. Kept under close guard, they were taken to a military barracks at Lingshui where they were interrogated for two nights before being moved to lodgings in Haikou, the provincial capital and largest city on the island.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-us-military-base-on-hainan-island>Is there a US military base on Hainan Island?</h2>
<p>A PRC Su-27 force is based at Hainan. The island also houses a large signals intelligence facility which tracks U.S. activity in the area and monitors traffic from commercial communications satellites.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-the-us-ambassador-to-china-in-1971>Who was the US Ambassador to China in 1971?</h2>
<p>Henry Kissinger, security adviser to President Nixon, left Pakistan for Beijing in the early morning of July 9, 1971 as a secret envoy (code-name: “Marco Polo”) to the People’s Republic of China. During his 48-hour stay in Beijing, Kissinger held nearly 20 hours of talks with Premier Zhou, which further opened the door of China-US relations.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-american-diplomats-being-attacked-in-china>Why are American diplomats being attacked in China?</h2>
<p>For months, American officials have been worried that their diplomats have been subjected to targeted attacks involving odd sounds, leading to symptoms similar to those “following concussion or minor traumatic brain injury,” the State Department says.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-american-consulate-evacuated-in-china>Where was the American consulate evacuated in China?</h2>
<p>The Americans who were evacuated worked at the American Consulate in the southern city of Guangzhou, and their colleagues and family members are being tested by a State Department medical team, officials said.</p>
