<h2 id=how-did-slavery-affect-the-plantation-economy>How did slavery affect the plantation economy?</h2>
<p>With more land needed for cultivation, the number of plantations expanded in the South and moved west into new territory. The upshot: As cotton became the backbone of the Southern economy, slavery drove impressive profits. The benefits of cotton produced by enslaved workers extended to industries beyond the South.</p>
<h2 id=what-social-effect-did-the-plantation-system-have-in-the-american-colonies>What social effect did the plantation system have in the American colonies?</h2>
<p>Because the economy of the South depended on the cultivation of crops, the need for agricultural labor led to the establishment of slavery. It also created a society sharply divided along class lines. For this reason, the contrast between the rich and the poor was greater in the South than it was in the North.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-plantation-system-influence-the-economic-development-of-the-us>How did the plantation system influence the economic development of the US?</h2>
<p>How did the plantation system influence the economic development of the United States? It prevented the development of industry in the Northeast. It turned the South into a major producer of the cotton used in northern mills. It restricted agricultural expansion in the western territories.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-slavery-function-economically-and-socially>How did slavery function economically and socially?</h2>
<p>How did slavery function economically and socially? Slavery isolated blacks from whites. As a result, African Americans began to develop a society and culture of their own separate from white civilization. Slaves made their plantations profitable.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-cotton-so-important-to-the-south-economy>Why was cotton so important to the South economy?</h2>
<p>Cotton transformed the United States, making fertile land in the Deep South, from Georgia to Texas, extraordinarily valuable. Growing more cotton meant an increased demand for slaves. Slaves in the Upper South became incredibly more valuable as commodities because of this demand for them in the Deep South.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-slave-system-affect-the-plantation-system>How did the slave system affect the plantation system?</h2>
<p>Because these crops required large areas of land, the plantations grew in size, and in turn, more slaves were required to work on the plantations. This sharpened class divisions, as a small number of people owned larger and larger plantations. Thus, the wealthy landowners got wealthier, and the use of slave labor increased.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-slavery-on-societies>What was the impact of slavery on societies?</h2>
<p>Slavery has had many consequences, good and bad, on the societies that participated. The consequences of slavery impacted the societies in different ways whether the societies sold slaves, like the Kingdom of Kongo or bought the slaves, like Brazil, both were impacted by the decision to do so.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-slavery-so-profitable-to-the-planters>Why was slavery so profitable to the planters?</h2>
<p>Irrespective of the jobs that slaves did, slavery on the whole was profitable. The expense to planters for housing, clothing, and feeding slaves was considerably less than the value they produced.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-end-of-the-foreign-slave-trade>What was the impact of the end of the foreign slave trade?</h2>
<p>The formal end to the foreign slave trade in 1808 had no impact—the smuggling of slaves was common—and in any event, natural increase accounted for practically all of the slave‐population growth in the United States. The nationwide distribution of slaves also changed during this time span.</p>
