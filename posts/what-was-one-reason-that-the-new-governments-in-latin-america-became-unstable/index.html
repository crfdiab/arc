<h2 id=what-was-the-only-stability-in-latin-america>What was the only stability in Latin America?</h2>
<p>The only stability for the next century seemed to be in despots. When Fidel Castro’s revolution inspired Latin America’s underclass to rebel, a robust, transnational network of military generals swatted it down with a fierce counterinsurgency force backed by the United States, Operation Condor.</p>
