<p>The first five year plan was created in order to initiate rapid and large-scale industrialization across the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Having begun on October 1st, 1928, the plan was already in its second year when Harry Byers first set foot in the Soviet Union.</p>
<h2 id=does-five-year-plan-still-exist>Does five year plan still exist?</h2>
<p>The Five-Year Plans were laid to rest by the Narendra Modi-led NDA government in 2015. Hence, the 12th five-year plan is considered the last five-year plan of India. The decades-old Five-Year Plans was replaced by a three-year action plan, which will be part of a seven-year strategy paper and a 15-year vision document.</p>

<h2 id=is-it-true-that-five-years-planning-was-started-on-this-day>Is it true that five years planning was started on this day?</h2>
<p>How naive are you. If it is true that five years planning was started on this day as claimed by the author , then this DAY SHOULD BE NAMED as “ECONOMY DISASTER DAY ” (EDD ) – the day on which Indian economy was shackled for next seven decades.</p>
