<h2 id=is-the-hale-telescope-still-used>Is the Hale telescope still used?</h2>
<p>It was completed in 1949 and is still in active use. The Hale Telescope represented the technological limit in building large optical telescopes for over 30 years.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-mount-wilson-observatory-built>When was Mount Wilson Observatory built?</h2>
<p>1904<br>
Mount Wilson Observatory/Founded</p>
<p>Mount Wilson Observatory opened in 1904, and for most of the first half of the 20th century, it became a home for the biggest telescopes and a destination for the world’s best scientists. George Ellery Hale, who founded the institute, innovated those massive telescopes while pursuing his research of the sun.</p>
<h2 id=which-kind-of-telescope-uses-a-lens-near-the-top-to-focus-the-light-near-the-bottom>Which kind of telescope uses a lens near the top to focus the light near the bottom?</h2>
<p>refracting telescope<br>
Currently, the largest refracting telescope is the 40-inch refractor at Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin. Figure 4: Refracting and Reflecting Telescopes. Light enters a refracting telescope through a lens at the upper end, which focuses the light near the bottom of the telescope.</p>
<h2 id=is-mount-wilson-a-volcano>Is Mount Wilson a volcano?</h2>
<p>Mount Wilson shield volcano is the most prominent of a group of Pleistocene shield volcanoes between Olallie Butte and Mount Hood (Sherrod, in Wood and Kienle, 1990).</p>
<h2 id=which-telescope-has-the-best-resolution>Which telescope has the best resolution?</h2>
<p>Hubble Space Telescope<br>
Answer: The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has a highest resolution of about 0.03 arcseconds, while the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) makes images with a resolution smaller than 0.001 arcsec. So, the VLBA has the HST beat when it comes to picture resolution.</p>
<h2 id=what-towers-are-on-mount-wilson>What towers are on Mount Wilson?</h2>
<p>It is the location of the Mount Wilson Observatory, which is an important astronomical facility in Southern California with historic 60-inch (1,524 mm) and 100-inch (2,540 mm) telescopes, and 60-foot (18.3 m) and 150-foot (45.7 m) solar towers.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-george-ellery-hale-do-for-a-living>What did George Ellery Hale do for a living?</h2>
<p>The American astronomer George Ellery Hale (1868-1938) designed and built three great observatories, invented the spectroheliograph, and discovered magnetic fields in sunspots. George Ellery Hale was born on June 29, 1868, in Chicago, Illinois, the eldest surviving son of William Ellery Hale and Mary Scranton Browne.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-tools-did-george-ellery-hale-use>What kind of tools did George Ellery Hale use?</h2>
<p>His tools were those he had used in boyhood—the telescope, the spectroscope, the photographic plate; his working place was the observatory combined with laboratory and shop where astrophysical problems might be solved to discover the physical nature of the universe. In 1886 Hale entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-george-ellery-hale-get-his-telescope-built>How did George Ellery Hale get his telescope built?</h2>
<p>As he had with Yerkes, Hale pursued a local philanthropist, hardware magnate John D. Hooker, for support. Delayed by the imposing challenge of producing the mirror and then by World War I, the 100-inch reflector finally became operational at Mount Wilson in 1918. Hale had for a third time built the largest telescope in the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-george-ellery-hale-interested-in-sunspots>Why was George Ellery Hale interested in sunspots?</h2>
<p>Fascinated with the structure of sunspots, Hale was able to show by 1908 that they were magnetically active storms of swirling gas in the solar photosphere.</p>
