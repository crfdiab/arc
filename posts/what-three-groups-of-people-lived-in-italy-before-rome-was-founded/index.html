<p>It may have come from the Etruscan word for the Tiber River, “rumon”. During the early formation of Rome, Italy was settled by many different peoples. These included the Latin peoples (the first to settle Rome), the Greeks (who settled along the coast of Italy), the Sabines, and the Etruscans.</p>
<h2 id=what-culture-originally-ruled-rome>What culture originally ruled Rome?</h2>
<p>The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks, adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. Etruscan religion was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury, since Rome had once been ruled by Etruscan kings.</p>

<p>At this time, archaeologists can also discern the arrival of the Beaker culture technology, marked by advanced pottery and stonework. Before the Romans, Italy was civilized for more than a millennium.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-ruler-of-italy-before-the-romans>Who was the ruler of Italy before the Romans?</h2>
<p>For centuries. However, modern people have been residing along the Italian peninsula for thousands of years before the Romans. Who were these people? And where did they come from? Listed below are 5 of many fascinating peoples and civilizations who ruled Italy before the Romans.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-ancient-people-of-ancient-italy>Who are the ancient people of ancient Italy?</h2>
<p>This list of ancient peoples living in Italy summarises groupings existing before the Roman expansion and conquest. Many of the names are either scholarly inventions or exonyms assigned by the ancient writers of works in ancient Greek and Latin.</p>

<p>In most history classes, the story of Italy begins with the Romans, but the Romans weren’t the first people to live in ancient Italy. Who did? Well, they were called the Etruscans, and they had their own fully-formed, complex society before the Romans came barging in. The Etruscans lived just north in Rome, in Tuscany.</p>
