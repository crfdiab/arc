<h2 id=does-russia-have-a-dress-code>Does Russia have a dress code?</h2>
<p>The dress code is formal both for men and women. Russians value being well dressed and nicely groomed. Men are expected to wear dark coloured suits with shirt and tie and stylish and conservative business suits, dresses and or trousers are appropriate for women.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-coats-do-they-wear-in-russia>What kind of coats do they wear in Russia?</h2>
<p>In any case, there’s considerable diversity in the way Russians dress. For men, wool-lined leather is popular, but down parkas or wool coats are also seen; for women, fur coats or woolen overcoats are probably the most common.</p>
<h2 id=are-jeans-allowed-in-russia>Are jeans allowed in Russia?</h2>
<p>No, they were not banned, they were sold a lot. One important thing to understand when speaking about jeans cult in the USSR is that only jeans made in the USA (such as Levi’s) were considered prestigious and difficult to get.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-people-dress-in-st-petersburg>How do people dress in St Petersburg?</h2>
<p>Petersburg requires layers, a warm coat, waterproof boots, thick socks, gloves, hat and scarf. Spring begins in late March, but days and nights often remain chilly until mid-May. Melting snow creates slush-covered, muddy roads. Include waterproof shoes, a thick overcoat and layered clothing.</p>
<h2 id=is-canada-goose-in-russia>Is Canada goose in Russia?</h2>
<p>Russia has also been a habitat for the Aleutian Canada goose (Branta canadensis leucopareia) which is included in the Red Data Book of Russia. The subspecies is endemic to Komandorskiye Islands.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-clothing-do-russian-men-wear>What kind of clothing do Russian men wear?</h2>
<p>Today, Russian men increasingly dress like men in Europe and America, favoring casual, comfortable clothing over the tracksuits that were emblematic of Russian male attire in the immediate post-Soviet years.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-wear-on-a-business-trip-to-russia>What to wear on a business trip to Russia?</h2>
<p>But very often Russian businessmen don’t pay much attention to following this rule. Business trip. Planning a business trip to Russia, mind that the winters here can be extremely cold, so ensure suitable clothing to meet whatever the prevailing conditions. Be sure to take a hat, gloves and a warm scarf in winter.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-clothing-did-russians-wear-before-communism>What kind of clothing did Russians wear before communism?</h2>
<p>However, since the fall of communism, economic improvements and an increase in trade with other countries has improved the quality of clothing and fashion for middle- and upper-class Russians of all ages. Prior to the 18th century, Russian attire remained largely the same as it had been during the Middle Ages.</p>
