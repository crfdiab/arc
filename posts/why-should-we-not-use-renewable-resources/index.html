<h2 id=why-should-we-not-use-renewable-resources>Why should we not use renewable resources?</h2>
<p>Why don’t we use renewable energy all the time? Unlike natural gas and coal, we can’t store up wind and sunshine to use when we need to make more electricity. If the wind doesn’t blow or the sun hides behind clouds, there sometimes isn’t enough power for everyone.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-benefits-of-renewable-resources>What are the benefits of renewable resources?</h2>
<p>Benefits of Renewable Energy</p>
<ul>
<li>Generating energy that produces no greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and reduces some types of air pollution.</li>
<li>Diversifying energy supply and reducing dependence on imported fuels.</li>
<li>Creating economic development and jobs in manufacturing, installation, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-is-fossil-fuels-better-than-renewable-energy>Why is fossil fuels better than renewable energy?</h2>
<p>In fact, renewables like solar and wind power—apart from construction and maintenance—don’t emit any CO2 at all. When comparing renewable energy to fossil fuels, remember that renewable energy generation is cleaner, easier to sustain over time, expanding more rapidly, and sometimes even cheaper than fossil fuels.</p>
<h2 id=is-renewable-or-nonrenewable-energy-cheaper>Is renewable or nonrenewable energy cheaper?</h2>
<p>In most places in the world power from new renewables is now cheaper than power from new fossil fuels. The fundamental driver of this change is that renewable energy technologies follow learning curves, which means that with each doubling of the cumulative installed capacity their price declines by the same fraction.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-negatives-of-using-renewable-resources>What are the negatives of using renewable resources?</h2>
<p>Here are some of the negative things that renewable resources are giving the people: • This renewable resource is affected by the weather condition in the atmosphere. If the sun is not shining brightly it is difficult for people to harness these renewable resources.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-fossil-fuels-bad-for-the-environment>How are fossil fuels bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>Fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas—do substantially more harm than renewable energy sources by most measures, including air and water pollution, damage to public health, wildlife and habitat loss, water use, land use, and global warming emissions.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-good-to-have-100-renewable-energy>Why is it good to have 100% renewable energy?</h2>
<p>Currently, any variability in the energy supply can be smoothed with non-renewable energy, of which we have a steady supply. If the goal is to go 100% renewable, we need to find a way to store the excess generated for later.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-hydroelectric-power-bad-for-the-environment>How is hydroelectric power bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>Hydropower dominates the global renewable energy market. Hydropower does not cause any air quality impact directly; however, building and operating a hydroelectric reservoir can lead to several harmful impacts on the environment.</p>
