<h2 id=how-important-is-farming-in-america>How important is farming in America?</h2>
<p>The US farming industry contributes more than $100 billion to the US economy. But the farming industry is being threatened by climate change, trade wars, and a changing workforce.</p>
<h2 id=is-north-america-good-for-farming>Is North America good for farming?</h2>
<p>The various peoples who developed North America have made it a world economic leader and, in general, a well-used and productive continent. Agriculture, though no longer the principal economic activity (except in some of the southern Latin countries), is still important. Wheat field, Kansas, U.S.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-north-have-better-agriculture>Why did the North have better agriculture?</h2>
<p>The Northern free states also were proved to produce more crops than the South, even with the North having considerably smaller labor force than the South’s slave industry. The North’s increased crops is most likely due to the recent invention of many farming machines that the South did invent and utilize.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-roles-of-farmers>What are the roles of farmers?</h2>
<p>Farmers play a vital role in providing the basics for all of our food needs. Farmers can play a very important role in changing the agricultural landscape for the better. Farmers can do great good by changing their methods of production to sustainable ones.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-north-make-money>How did the North make money?</h2>
<p>In the North, the economy was based on industry. They built factories and manufactured products to sell to other countries and to the southern states. Most people in the North worked in factories or owned their own businesses. They also planted small farms or gardens to help feed their families.</p>

<p>Agriculture of North America The various peoples who developed North America have made it a world economic leader and, in general, a well-used and productive continent . Agriculture, though no longer the principal economic activity (except in some of the southern Latin countries), is still important.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-have-a-farm>Why is it important to have a farm?</h2>
<p>I can think of 3 good reasons: 1) you can make great food on a farm, 2) farming can be an important contributor to our local economies, and 3) farming is great conservation. 1. You can make great food on a farm.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-agriculture-so-important-in-world-war-2>Why was agriculture so important in World War 2?</h2>
<p>Agriculture is such an important part of a country’s infrastructure, it makes sense it would impact conflicts and war. Throughout history, the need for land to grow food fueled many conflicts. In more modern times, specifically WWI, America’s farming industry boomed because they needed to supply Europe with agricultural products.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-farming-important-to-the-local-economy>Why is farming important to the local economy?</h2>
<p>Farming can be an important contributor to our local economies. I believe that every discussion on the development of our local economy must start with farming and food and feeding those who live nearby. The area around these parts was once known as the Adirondack Crescent.</p>
