<h2 id=when-did-london-get-a-sewage-system>When did London get a sewage system?</h2>
<p>2 August 1858<br>
Parliament was forced to hurriedly legislate to create a new unified sewage system for London. The Bill became law on 2 August 1858. Sir Joseph Bazalgette (1819-1891).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-london-before-sewers>What was London before sewers?</h2>
<p>Before the construction of proper sewers, most of London’s sewage was recycled as fertilizer. Individual houses had cesspools (though often these were just the cellars).</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-sewage-system-built>When was the first sewage system built?</h2>
<p>United States. The first sewer systems in the United States were built in the late 1850s in Chicago and Brooklyn. In the United States, the first sewage treatment plant using chemical precipitation was built in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1890.</p>
<h2 id=who-built-the-first-sewer-system>Who built the first sewer system?</h2>
<p>The Minoans built latrines connected with vertical chutes to an elaborate stone sewer system. The Persians, Athenians, Macedonians, and Greeks also built impressive sewer systems. The Romans integrated earlier sewer innovations into the cloaca maxima, first built around 800 BC.</p>
<h2 id=why-shouldnt-you-drink-water-from-the-bathroom-tap>Why shouldn’t you drink water from the bathroom tap?</h2>
<p>Whilst on the subject of which taps are safe to drink from, it’s worth mentioning that it’s never a good idea to drink from the hot water tap. The hot water is often stored in tanks that can be heated and cooled many times and could lead to the growth of bacteria such as legionella.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-man-who-built-the-sewer-system-in-london>Who was the man who built the sewer system in London?</h2>
<p>Sir Joseph Bazalgette was the Victorian engineering mastermind and public health visionary behind the vast sewage system that Londoners still rely on today.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-sewage-does-the-london-sewer-system-handle>How much sewage does the London sewer system handle?</h2>
<p>Improvements, repairs and additions have been made to this sewerage system from time to time and this greatest civil engineering project of its time still handles about 1.8 billion litres of sewage everyday.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-200th-anniversary-of-the-london-sewer-system>When is the 200th anniversary of the London sewer system?</h2>
<p>Thursday 28th March 2019 marks the 200 th anniversary of the birth of Sir Joseph Bazalgette, the Victorian engineering mastermind and public health visionary behind the vast sewage system that Londoners still rely on today.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-thames-water-system-first-built>When was the Thames Water System first built?</h2>
<p>The modern system was developed during the late 19th century, and as London has grown the system has been expanded. It is currently owned and operated by Thames Water and serves almost all of Greater London .</p>
