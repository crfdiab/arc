<h2 id=what-did-the-english-bill-of-rights-establish>What did the English Bill of Rights establish?</h2>
<p>The English Bill of Rights created a constitutional monarchy in England, meaning the king or queen acts as head of state but his or her powers are limited by law. Under this system, the monarchy couldn’t rule without the consent of Parliament, and the people were given individual rights.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-bill-of-rights-help-america>How did the Bill of Rights help America?</h2>
<p>It spells out Americans’ rights in relation to their government. It guarantees civil rights and liberties to the individual—like freedom of speech, press, and religion. It sets rules for due process of law and reserves all powers not delegated to the Federal Government to the people or the States.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-english-bill-of-rights-an-important-influence-on-the-american-government>Why was the English Bill of Rights an important influence on the American government?</h2>
<p>The English Bill of Rights denounced King James II for abusing his power. The English Bill of Rights clearly established that the monarchy could not rule without consent of Parliament.

<h2 id=how-did-the-bill-of-rights-influence-the-declaration-of-independence>How did the Bill of Rights influence the declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>The Petition of Right 1628, the Declaration of Right, 1689 and the Bill of Rights 1689 established certain rights in statute. In America, the English Bill of Rights was one of the influences on the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights, which in turn influenced the United States Declaration of Independence later that year.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-bill-of-rights-and-the-us-legal-system-work>How does the Bill of Rights and the US legal system work?</h2>
<p>The possibility and option of pursuing that avenue nevertheless exists for those willing to see the pursuit of justice through to its conclusion. These are the fundamental roles of the Bill of Rights and the legal system in protecting the liberties American citizens enjoy.</p>
