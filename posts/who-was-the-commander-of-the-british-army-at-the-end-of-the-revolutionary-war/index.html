<p>William Howe<br>
William Howe, in full William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe, (born August 10, 1729—died July 12, 1814, Plymouth, Devonshire, England), commander in chief of the British army in North America (1776–78) who, despite several military successes, failed to destroy the Continental Army and stem the American Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=who-ended-up-winning-the-revolutionary-war>Who ended up winning the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>Americans<br>
After French assistance helped the Continental Army force the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, the Americans had effectively won their independence, though fighting would not formally end until 1783.</p>
<h2 id=what-ended-the-american-revolutionary-war>What ended the American Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>April 19, 1775 – September 3, 1783<br>
American Revolutionary War/Periods<br>
The Treaty of Paris, signed on September 3, 1783, ended the American Revolutionary War between Great Britain and the United States and its allies.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-the-last-british-commander-in-chief-in-america>Who was the last British commander in chief in America?</h2>
<p>The final effective British commander in chief in America was Sir Guy Carleton, who had defended Quebec in 1775, but had been passed over in favour of Burgoyne in 1777 as a result of his perceived over-caution.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-british-commander-in-chief-at-yorktown>Who was the British commander in chief at Yorktown?</h2>
<p>The reputation of General Sir Henry Clinton, the commander in chief of the British troops in North America, suffered greatly following the defeat at Yorktown and the British Empire’s loss of the Colonies. Cornwallis remained in favor, however, and continued his career as a commander and administrator in other parts of the empire.</p>
