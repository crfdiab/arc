Italy/President<br>
Sergio Mattarella OMRI OMCA (Italian pronunciation: [ˈsɛrdʒo mattaˈrɛlla]; born 23 July 1941) is an Italian politician, jurist, academic and lawyer who has served as the 12th and current President of Italy since 2015.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-people-from-naples-called-neapolitan>Why are people from Naples called Neapolitan?</h2>
<p>Napolitano (Modern Italian “Napoletano”, Neapolitan: Nnapulitano) is translated in English as Neapolitan. The word can refer to people from Napoli (Naples), their language, culture in addition to being an Italian surname.</p>
<h2 id=has-there-ever-been-a-female-president-in-italy>Has there ever been a female president in Italy?</h2>
<p>The 12 presidents came from only six of the 20 regions: three each from Campania (all born in Naples) and Piedmont, two each from Sardinia (both born in Sassari) and Tuscany and one each from Liguria and Sicily. No woman has held the office yet.</p>
<h2 id=has-sweden-ever-had-a-female-prime-minister>Has Sweden ever had a female prime minister?</h2>
<p>When Sweden got a centre-right government under Centre Party Prime Minister Thorbjörn Fälldin in 1976, she was named Minister for Foreign Affairs, the first woman ever to hold the post in Sweden.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-giorgio-napolitano-do-in-southern-italy>What did Giorgio Napolitano do in southern Italy?</h2>
<p>He became a member of the Secretariat of the Italian Economic Centre for Southern Italy in 1946, which was represented by Senator Paratore, where he remained for two years. Napolitano played a major role in the Movement for the Rebirth of Southern Italy for over ten years.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-giorgio-napolitano-when-he-resigned>How old was Giorgio Napolitano when he resigned?</h2>
<p>After a record eight and a half years as President, Napolitano resigned at age 89 in January 2015. Napolitano was often accused by his critics of having transformed a largely ceremonial role into a political one, becoming, during the years of his tenure, the real kingmaker of the Italian politics.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-giorgio-napolitano-elected-to-the-chamber-of-deputies>When was Giorgio Napolitano elected to the Chamber of Deputies?</h2>
<p>Napolitano played a major role in the Movement for the Rebirth of Southern Italy for over ten years. He was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1953 for the electoral district of Naples, and was reelected in every election until 1996.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-giorgio-napolitano-go-to-high-school>Where did Giorgio Napolitano go to high school?</h2>
<p>His father, Giovanni, was a liberal lawyer and poet; his mother was Carolina Bobbio, a descendant of a noble Piedmontese family. From 1938 to 1941 he studied at the Classical Lyceum Umberto I of Naples, but in 1941 his family moved to Padova and he was graduated to the lyceum Titus Livius.</p>
