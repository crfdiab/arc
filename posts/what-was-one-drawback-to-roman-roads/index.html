<h2 id=what-was-one-drawback-to-roman-roads>What was one drawback to Roman roads?</h2>
<p>Answer: They were bumpy and there were a lot of obstacles and bandits who were waiting for the traveler.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-a-problem-along-the-roman-roads>What was a problem along the Roman roads?</h2>
<p>Most roads were paths or dirt roads that caused problems for travelers, military, and merchants. During Ancient Roman times roads were unpaved or were simple common paths. The problem with these rudimentary roads is that when bad weather came the roads would get destroyed and the paths washed away.</p>
<h2 id=what-river-made-a-highway-for-travel-in-rome>What river made a highway for travel in Rome?</h2>
<p>Origin of the Name Tiber In his “History of Rome,” the German classicist Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) wrote that the Tiber was the natural highway for traffic in Latium and provided an early defense against neighbors on the other side of the river, which in the area of Rome runs approximately southward.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-drawbacks-of-ancient-rome>What were the drawbacks of ancient Rome?</h2>
<p>1. A disadvantages that Rome had because of their geography is since they were by so much water this could possibly cause for lots of flooding. 2. Another disadvantage that Rome had because of their geography is that there was many mountains around them so this made travel to other land harder to do.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-disadvantages-of-being-a-citizen-of-rome-compared-to-being-an-ally>What were the disadvantages of being a citizen of Rome compared to being an ally?</h2>
<p>There were disadvantages: they had to pay tribute to Rome as well as provide soldiers, indeed, by 100 BCE allies composed two-thirds of the Roman army. They subsisted in a vague second-class status called ius Latii. They had many of the benefits of a citizen but without representation in any of the city’s assemblies.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-roads-left-from-the-roman-empire>Are there any roads left from the Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>(Photo: Philip Capper/WikiCommons CC BY 2.0 ) Roman roads are still visible across Europe. Some are built over by national highway systems, while others still have their original cobbles—including some of the roads considered by the Romans themselves to be the most important of their system.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-romans-build-so-many-roads>Why did the Romans build so many roads?</h2>
<p>All roads lead to Rome, one of the reasons why the Roman Empire became as powerful as it did was because of their ingenious and long-lasting roads. The Romans were famous road builders.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-ruins-of-ancient-roman-bridges>Where are the ruins of ancient Roman bridges?</h2>
<p>There are ruins of bridges still visible, such as in Northumberland, where parts of Hadrian’s Wall and Chesters Bridge can be seen, as well as in Durham, at Piercebridge. A map of Roman roads in Britain. (Photo: Public Domain/WikiCommons)</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-roman-road-from-fosse-lead>Where did the Roman road from Fosse lead?</h2>
<p>Other minor Roman roads lead from Ilchester and Lydford-on-Fosse towards Street and the A39 route along the Polden Hills, leading to Roman salt works on the Somerset Levels, and ports at Combwich, Crandon Bridge and Highbridge.</p>
