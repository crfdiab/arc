<h2 id=who-created-the-far-side>Who created The Far Side?</h2>
<p>Gary Larson<br>
The Far Side/Authors</p>
<p>“The Far Side” creator Gary Larson has published three new cartoons on his website — with fans and fellow cartoonists rejoicing at his first fresh work in 25 years.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-far-side>When was the first far side?</h2>
<p>Dec. 31, 1979<br>
“The Far Side” launched on Dec. 31, 1979, and ran through Jan. 1, 1995. At the height of its popularity, the syndicated single-panel strip was reportedly carried by nearly 2,000 newspapers and translated into multiple languages.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-far-side-galleries-are-there>How many Far Side galleries are there?</h2>
<p>There are 23 collected editions of The Far Side, which combined have sold over 45 million copies and have generated US$70 million in revenue.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-far-side-end>When did The Far Side end?</h2>
<p>1 January 1995<br>
The Far Side/End dates<br>
He is the creator of The Far Side, a single-panel cartoon series that was syndicated internationally to more than 1,900 newspapers for fifteen years. The series ended with Larson’s retirement on January 1, 1995. In September 2019 his website alluded to a “new online era of ‘The Far Side.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-a-thagomizer>Why is it called a Thagomizer?</h2>
<p>Etymology. The term thagomizer was coined by Gary Larson in jest. In a 1982 The Far Side comic, a group of cavemen in a faux-modern lecture hall are taught by their caveman professor that the spikes on a stegosaur’s tail are so named “after the late Thag Simmons.”</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-term-far-side-mean>What does the term far side mean?</h2>
<p>1 : the farther side the far side of the lake. 2 or farside \ ˈfär-​ˌsīd \ : the side of the moon away from the earth the lunar farside. on the far side of. : beyond just on the far side of 40.</p>
<h2 id=why-cant-we-see-the-other-side-of-moon>Why can’t we see the other side of moon?</h2>
<p>As the Earth is much larger than the Moon, the Moon’s rotation is slowed down until it reaches a balance point. As this NASA animation shows (right), this means that the same portion of the Moon always faces towards the Earth, and we can never see the far side.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-spikes-on-a-dinosaur-back-called>What are the spikes on a dinosaur back called?</h2>
<p>The quadrupedal Stegosaurus is one of the most easily identifiable dinosaur genera, due to the distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates rising vertically along the rounded back and the two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of the tail.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-stegosaurus-have-plates-on-their-back>Why do Stegosaurus have plates on their back?</h2>
<p>The plates were a temperature-regulation device. If Stegosaurus was, in fact, cold-blooded (as most plant-eating dinosaurs of the Mesozoic Era presumably were), it might have used its plates to soak up light from the sun during the day and dissipate extra body heat at night.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-creator-of-the-far-side>Who is the creator of the far side?</h2>
<p>The Far Side is a popular one-panel syndicated comic strip created by Gary Larson.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-far-side-gallery-4-come-from>Where did the Far Side Gallery 4 come from?</h2>
<p>The Far Side Gallery 4 is one of many book collections showcasing his cartoons. It includes 150+ pages of monsters, mad scientists, four-eyed kids, goofy wildlife and a foreword by Robin Williams. I found it at a local thrift shop, and snapped it up.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-far-side-comic-strip-come-out>When did the Far Side comic strip come out?</h2>
<p>Additional best-of collections were published, such as The Prehistory of The Far Side, culminating in the final, most complete publication, The Complete Far Side . October 1996: Last Chapter and Worse ( ISBN 0-8362-2131-1; published after the end of the strip) April 1998: There’s a Hair in My Dirt!</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-far-side-prehistory-published>When was the far side Prehistory published?</h2>
<p>In 1989, The Prehistory Of The Far Side was published to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the strip.</p>
