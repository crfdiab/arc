<h2 id=what-is-the-sie-for>What is the SIE for?</h2>
<p>The SIE Exam is a required qualifications exam administered by FINRA. It tests basic information including products, risks, the structure & function of the securities industry & its regulatory agencies, and knowledge of regulated & prohibited practices.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-the-sie-last>How long does the SIE last?</h2>
<p>four years<br>
The SIE will be valid for four years from the date that you pass the exam. This means that if you become employed by a broker-dealer during the four-year period and need to become registered as a general securities representative, you will not need to take the SIE again.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-sie-and-series-7>What is the difference between SIE and Series 7?</h2>
<p>For example, while both cover options strategies and calculations, the SIE focuses more on basic options positions, such as single positions and hedging strategies, whereas the Series 7 Top-Off goes a step further and tests on advanced positions, such as spreads and straddles.</p>
<h2 id=how-difficult-is-the-sie>How difficult is the SIE?</h2>
<p>You need to get a score of 70%, or higher, to pass. During your SIE exam prep, be honest with yourself about how much knowledge you have going in. If you have a hard time defining a “stock” or “bond” for example, then you should expect to take about two months to study on average.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-pass-the-sie>What does it mean to pass the SIE?</h2>
<p>The Securities Industry Essentials® (SIE®) Exam is a FINRA exam for prospective securities industry professionals. In order to become registered to engage in securities business, an individual must pass the SIE and a qualification exam appropriate for the type of business the individual will engage in.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-should-i-study-for-sie>How long should I study for SIE?</h2>
<p>In order to pass the SIE exam, you will likely need to dedicate many hours over the course of weeks (or months) to study the material. While everyone retains information a bit differently, it’s recommended that you spend at least 50 hours seriously studying before your exam.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hours-should-i-study-for-the-sie-exam>How many hours should I study for the Sie exam?</h2>
<h2 id=what-is-the-sie-pass-rate>What is the SIE pass rate?</h2>
<p>74%<br>
What is the SIE exam pass rate? The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reports a 74% pass rate among 58,264 first-time test takers (as of January 2019). Although the average SIE exam pass rate is above 70%, don’t assume that it’s easy.</p>
<h2 id=is-series-6-or-7-better>Is series 6 or 7 better?</h2>
<p>After passing the Series 6 Exam, you’re able to sell mutual funds, variable annuities, and other variable products on behalf of a company. Typically, the Series 7 is the better choice if you’re interested in selling individual securities either now or in the future.</p>
<h2 id=should-i-take-sie-before-series-7>Should I take Sie before Series 7?</h2>
<p>SIE is a co-requisite for the Series 6 and Series 7 exams and can be taken any time before or after the Top-Off exams (within 4 years). We recommend, however, that you pass your SIE exam first and then prepare for Series 6 or 7 Top-Off.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-hard-to-pass-the-sie-exam>Is it hard to pass the SIE exam?</h2>
<p>What is the SIE exam pass rate? The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reports a 74% pass rate among 58,264 first-time test takers (as of January 2019). Although the average SIE exam pass rate is above 70%, don’t assume that it’s easy.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hours-should-you-study-for-sie>How many hours should you study for SIE?</h2>
<h2 id=how-to-say--i-love-you--in-polish>How to say ” I Love you ” in Polish?</h2>
<p>If you are using the love quotes on your mobile phone, you can simply copy and paste them right into the text message. Please leave a comment or question if you need guidance on winning the hand a girl from Polska. Do you love me? – Kochasz mnie? I like you – Podobasz mi się. You have to have a big hart to love a little.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-a-guy-sends-you-a-hey-you-text>What does it mean when a guy sends you a Hey you text?</h2>
<p>Whether it’s from a guy you have zero interest in or from your ex who doesn’t understand that your relationship is WAY over, checking your phone for a notification only to see that your message reads “hey u” is a disappointment no matter the sender.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a--hi--or--hey--text-mean>What does a ” hi ” or ” Hey ” text mean?</h2>
<p>A casual “hi,” “hey,” or “hello” seems so simple, but it can actually mean a lot. First, the fact that your crush went out of their way to send you a greeting means they were obviously thinking about you. You don’t just send someone a “hi” text just for the heck of it.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-a-girl-sends-a-friend-zone-text>What does it mean when a girl sends a friend zone text?</h2>
<p>If this happens to you, accept it: She’s not interested in you sexually. She really just likes you as a friend. So she strategically only invites you to things she knows will become group events. This is the text that reads, “Hey, I can’t do drinks on Friday but (insert mutual friend here) is having a party Saturday. You should come!”</p>
