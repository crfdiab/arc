<h2 id=how-did-ghana-become-a-nation>How did Ghana become a nation?</h2>
<p>Formerly known as the Gold Coast, Ghana gained independence from Britain in 1957, becoming the first sub-Saharan nation to break free from colonial rule. Gold, cocoa and more recently oil form the cornerstone of Ghana’s economy and have helped fuel an economic boom.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-ghana-succeed>How did Ghana succeed?</h2>
<p>Once an African success story built on gold, oil and cocoa, Ghana leveraged its natural resources to produce strong economic growth in the early years of this century. It met the millennium development goal of halving poverty rates by 2015, and was hailed as a model of political stability after peaceful elections.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-ghana-become-a-sovereign-nation-in-the-world>When did Ghana become a sovereign nation in the world?</h2>
<p>The nation Ghana assum its status of sovereign nationhood in 1957, when what started as the British colony called the Gold Coast, was officially registered at the United Nation as a nation that was accorded a sovereign status, under the formal name Ghana.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-nation-of-ghana-a-formal-state>Is the nation of Ghana a formal state?</h2>
<p>The nation of Ghana is a formal state with its own unique nationality. Like any modern nation in the world, the nation of Ghana was form out of serveral tribal nations, each with its unique characteristics and nationals.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-nationals-of-the-ghanaian-nation>Who are the Nationals of the Ghanaian nation?</h2>
<p>Therefore the nationals of Ghana to the layman are the members of the tribal nations, whether they are officially Ghanaians or not. However the official position is, Ghana is a nation in its own right and a national of Ghana is any one officially recognise as a Ghanaian.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-be-ghanaian-to-be-a-ghanaian>Do you have to be Ghanaian to be a Ghanaian?</h2>
<p>The identity of a Ghanaian can not and must not be Dagbani, Gonja, Dagati, Fanti, Ga, Ewe or Twi, as all these are informal nationalities and characterisations. The formal nationality of a Ghanaian must be a Ghanaian and clearly back by documentation to establish the individual’s identity.</p>
