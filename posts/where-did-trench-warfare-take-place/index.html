<h2 id=where-did-trench-warfare-take-place>Where did trench warfare take place?</h2>
<p>Trenches were common throughout the Western Front. Trench warfare in World War I was employed primarily on the Western Front, an area of northern France and Belgium that saw combat between German troops and Allied forces from France, Great Britain and, later, the United States.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-trenches-in-france>Where are the trenches in France?</h2>
<p>One of the places to see preserved First World War trenches is at the Vimy Memorial Park in northern France.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-ww1-battlefields-in-france>Where are the ww1 battlefields in France?</h2>
<p>Here are four tunnels and trenches visitors can see firsthand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canadian Memorial, Vimy, France.</li>
<li>Wellington Quarry, Arras, France.</li>
<li>Sanctuary Wood, Ypres, Belgium.</li>
<li>Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial, Beaumont-Hamel, France.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=did-france-dig-trenches-in-ww1>Did France dig trenches in ww1?</h2>
<p>By the end of October 1914, the whole front in Belgium and France had solidified into lines of trenches, which lasted until the last weeks of the war.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-they-build-trenches-in-ww1>Why did they build trenches in WW1?</h2>
<p>After the early war of movement in the late summer of 1914, artillery and machine guns forced the armies on the Western Front to dig trenches to protect themselves. Fighting ground to a stalemate.</p>
<h2 id=are-the-trenches-from-ww1-still-there>Are the trenches from WW1 still there?</h2>
<p>Trench Remains There are a small number of places where sections of trench lines can still be visited. Nevertheless, there are still remains of trenches to be found in remote parts of the battlefields such as the woods of the Argonne, Verdun and the mountains of the Vosges.</p>
<h2 id=do-the-trenches-from-ww1-still-exist>Do the trenches from WW1 still exist?</h2>
<p>A few of these places are private or public sites with original or reconstructed trenches preserved as a museum or memorial. Nevertheless, there are still remains of trenches to be found in remote parts of the battlefields such as the woods of the Argonne, Verdun and the mountains of the Vosges.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-world-war-1-trenches-look-like>What did World War 1 trenches look like?</h2>
<p>Trenches were long, narrow ditches dug into the ground where soldiers lived. They were very muddy, uncomfortable and the toilets overflowed. There were many lines of German trenches on one side and many lines of Allied trenches on the other.</p>
<h2 id=did-lance-corporal-william-schofield-survive>Did Lance Corporal William Schofield survive?</h2>
<p>Lance Corporal William Schofield South Wales Borderers. Died Saturday 19 May 1917 – A Street Near You.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-trench-warfare-fall-out-of-favour>Why did trench warfare fall out of favour?</h2>
<p>Trench warfare was too rigid and impractical on larger fronts. Trenches are still common in warfare. However massive trench networks are impractical to produce, and become useless if the enemy makes it past the trench, or if the people manning the trench chose to attack. Even during WW1 trenches were uncommon in the eastern (Russian western) front.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-trench-warfare-start-on-the-western-front>When did trench warfare start on the Western Front?</h2>
<p>Trench warfare prevailed on the Western Front from late 1914 until the Germans launched their Spring Offensive on March 21, 1918. After the buildup of forces in 1915, the Western Front became a stalemated struggle between equals to be decided by attrition.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-trenches-work-in-world-war-2>How did trenches work in World War 2?</h2>
<p>Communications trenches connected the front line to the second. Units rotated among these successive lines of defence, which were protected by dense curls of barbed wire. Each trench was dug in a hatched pattern so that even if enemy soldiers entered a trench during an attack they could not fire down its entire length.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-weather-like-in-the-french-trenches>What was the weather like in the French trenches?</h2>
<p>As most of the Western Front was located on relatively flat terrain in a wet climate, with the water table quite close to the surface, “ever-present mud, the regular flooding of trenches, and the general confusion of physical space profoundly shaped soldiers’ experience.” French trenches paled in comparison to their German counterparts.</p>
