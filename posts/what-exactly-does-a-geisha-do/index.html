<h2 id=what-exactly-does-a-geisha-do>What exactly does a geisha do?</h2>
<p>Geisha (or geiko) are professional entertainers who attend guests during meals, banquets and other occasions. They are trained in various traditional Japanese arts, such as dance and music, as well as in the art of communication.</p>

<p>Onna-Bugeisha<br>
While the word “samurai” is a strictly masculine term, female warriors have existed in Japan since as early as 200 AD. Known as “Onna-Bugeisha” (literally meaning “woman warrior”), these women were trained in martial arts and strategy, and fought alongside the samurai to defend their homes, families and honour.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-a-geisha-in-japan>What is the role of a geisha in Japan?</h2>
<p>The role of geisha is to entertain guests through conversation, drinking games, dance performances, and more during meals, parties, banquets and other occasions. For these occasions, they usually serve their clients at an ochaya (tea house) or at a ryōtei (traditional Japanese restaurant).</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-most-literal-translation-of-the-word-geisha>What’s the most literal translation of the word geisha?</h2>
<p>The most literal translation of “geisha” in the English language would be “artist”, “performing artist” or “artisan”. Another regional term for geisha with a slightly different meaning is geiko, a term used to describe geisha in Western Japan, including Kyoto and Kanazawa.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-a-girl-to-become-a-geisha>How long does it take a girl to become a geisha?</h2>
<p>The early Shikomi (in-training) and Minarai (learns by watching) stages of geisha training lasted for years (shikomi) and months (minarai) respectively, which is significantly longer than in contemporary times. A girl is often a shikomi for up to a year while the modern minarai period is simply one month.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-japanese-call-the-geisha-the-willows>Why did the Japanese call the Geisha The Willows?</h2>
<p>Before they disappeared, the courtesans were the colourful “flowers” and the geisha the ” willows ” because of their subtlety, strength, and grace. In the early stages of Japanese history, there were female entertainers: Saburuko (serving girls) were mostly wandering girls whose families were displaced from struggles in the late 600s.</p>
