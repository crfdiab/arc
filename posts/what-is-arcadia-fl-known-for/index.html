<h2 id=is-the-arcadia-neighborhood-in-phoenix-a-historic-district>Is the Arcadia neighborhood in Phoenix a historic district?</h2>
<p>While the Arcadia neighborhood is not a historic district, and it is not even entirely in Phoenix (the eastern edge is actually in the City of Scottsdale), Arcadia still has a big place in Phoenix history and so we are claiming it!</p>

<p>You’d be hard pressed to find a new home built to the same high quality today.

Arcadia’s housing market is definitely looking great in the valley of the sun.</p>

<p>The lush, green, mature landscapes of the irrigated Arcadia parcels are not found many places in Phoenix.
