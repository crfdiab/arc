<h2 id=what-event-turned-public-opinion-against-the-homestead-strikers-in-1892>What event turned public opinion against the Homestead strikers in 1892?</h2>
<p>What event turned public opinion against the Homestead strikers in 1892? Alexander Berkman attempted to assassinate Henry Clay Frick. → Alexander Berkman, an anarchist, hoped to ignite a general workers’ uprising by assassinating Henry Clay Frick.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-carnegie-think-of-the-homestead-strike>What did Carnegie think of the Homestead Strike?</h2>
<p>“Far too many men required by Amalgamated rules.” Carnegie believed workers would agree to relinquish their union to hold on to their jobs. It was a severe miscalculation. Although only 750 of the 3,800 workers at Homestead belonged to the union, 3,000 of them met and voted overwhelmingly to strike.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-carnegie-response-to-the-homestead-strike-affect-public>How did Carnegie response to the Homestead Strike affect public?</h2>
<p>Carnegie was publicly in favor of the unions. The members of AA demanded a salary increase; Frick responded immediately with a 22% decrease in salary that would affect almost half of the union members and removed several AA members who worked in his factory from their positions.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-workers-strike-at-the-homestead-steel-plant>Why did the workers strike at the Homestead steel plant?</h2>
<p>The AA engaged in a bitter strike at the Homestead works on January 1, 1882, in an effort to prevent management from including a non-union clause in the workers’ contracts, known as a “yellow-dog contract”. The violence occurred on both sides, and the plant brought in numerous strikebreakers.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-the-unskilled-workers-lose-from-supporting-the-strike>What would the unskilled workers lose from supporting the strike?</h2>
<p>In response, the union’s advisory committee voted to strike. The Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers called a meeting of all the workers at the plant. Their goal: to win the support of the unskilled workers for their strike. But, if the unskilled went to work as scabs, the strike would be lost.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-homestead-strike-affect-andrew-carnegie>How did the Homestead Strike affect Andrew Carnegie?</h2>
<p>These working conditions led to the Homestead Strike, during which many of the strikers expressed their opposition to the working conditions and low pay in Carnegie’s steel mills. This violent strike ended in a dozen deaths and helped Carnegie and other business tycoons maintain control over workers by denying them the right to unionize.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-manager-of-the-homestead-strike>Who was the manager of the Homestead Strike?</h2>
<p>Andrew Carnegie gave his operations manager, Henry Clay Frick, permission to break the union before this deadline. Frick began by cutting the workers’ wages, which the workers protested by starting the Homestead Strike.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-andrew-carnegie-do-to-his-workers>What did Andrew Carnegie do to his workers?</h2>
<p>Carnegie came across as uncaring when casualties happened. When a machine exploded, killing several of his workers, he expressed more concern for the loss of production caused by the incident than for the loss of life.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-homestead-strike-change-the-world>How did the Homestead Strike change the world?</h2>
<p>The Homestead Strike changed the traditional American business environment by creating new laws and the awareness of the need for peace in business world. The Carnegie Steel Company was a successful factory, which employed many hundred of workers.</p>
