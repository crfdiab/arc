<h2 id=how-much-will-the-water-rise-if-all-ice-melts>How much will the water rise if all ice melts?</h2>
<p>If all the ice covering Antarctica , Greenland, and in mountain glaciers around the world were to melt, sea level would rise about 70 meters (230 feet). The ocean would cover all the coastal cities. And land area would shrink significantly. But many cities, such as Denver, would survive.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-ice-melting-lead-to>What does ice melting lead to?</h2>
<p>Melting ice causes more warming. As global warming causes more snow and ice to melt each summer, the ocean and land that were underneath the ice are exposed at the Earth’s surface. Because they are darker in color, the ocean and land absorb more incoming solar radiation, and then release the heat to the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=is-ice-less-dense-than-water>Is ice less dense than water?</h2>
<p>It happens that the lattice arrangement allows water molecules to be more spread out than in a liquid, and, thus, ice is less dense than water.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-ice-melting-bad>Why is ice melting bad?</h2>
<p>Melting glaciers add to rising sea levels, which in turn increases coastal erosion and elevates storm surge as warming air and ocean temperatures create more frequent and intense coastal storms like hurricanes and typhoons.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-ice-melting-not-change-the-water-level-in-a>Why does ice melting not change the water level in a?</h2>
<p>Note that the water level doesn’t change as the ice melts ONLY if the ice is melting in pure water. If you melt ice cubes in salt water, the water level will increase as the ice melts. Consider an ice cube of 10cm, assume that the density of water and ice is 10:9.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-calculate-sea-level-when-ice-melts>How to calculate sea level when ice melts?</h2>
<p>Compare the water level with the marked line on the side of the container or in the clay. Allow the ice in both tubs to melt completely. Use the measurements recorded on the data sheet to create a line graph representing the water level in each tub. You can do this using paper or on a computer with spreadsheet software.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-part1-and-part2-of-ice-melt>What happens when PART1 and Part2 of ice melt?</h2>
<p>The displaced water volume equals part2 volume and has as much mass as (part1+part2) Now look at what happens when both part1 and part2 melt: it becomes water. And we just said that part1+part2 mass water has part2 volume. You mention “The displaced water volume equals part2 volume and has as much mass as (part1+part2)”.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-ice-affect-the-height-of-water>How does ice affect the height of water?</h2>
<p>Assume we have one cube of ice in a glass of water. The ice displaces some of that water, raising the height of the water by an amount we will call h. Archimedes’ principle states that the weight of water displaced will equal the upward buoyancy force provided by that water. In this case,</p>
