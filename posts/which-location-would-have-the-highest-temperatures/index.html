<h2 id=which-location-would-have-the-highest-temperatures>Which location would have the highest temperatures?</h2>
<p>According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the highest registered air temperature on Earth was 56.7 °C (134.1 °F) in Furnace Creek Ranch, California, located in Death Valley in the United States, on 10 July 1913.</p>
<h2 id=is-nevada-one-of-the-hottest-states>Is Nevada one of the hottest states?</h2>
<p>3rd Place: Nevada (125°) The deserts of Nevada are hot nearly every day in the summer, so it’s no surprise that this state made the Top 3 when it comes to highest all-time temperature. The hottest temperature in Nevada’s history is 125 degrees, and it first happened in Laughlin, NV, on July 29, 1994.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-californias-hottest-day>What is California’s hottest day?</h2>
<p>Death Valley National Park’s Furnace Creek Visitor Center hit an astonishing 130.0 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4°C) on Friday afternoon, July 9, 2021, beating the previous world record of 129.9 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4°C), set there on August 16, 2020.</p>

<p>In the winter, average daytime high temperatures are usually well above freezing. Average overnight lows are typically above 0° F (-18° C). These mild temperatures are a result of California’s Mediterranean climate and the relative nearness of the ocean.</p>

<p>The highest temperature ever recorded in California was 134 °F (57 °C) in Death Valley on July 10, 1913. This is also the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth.</p>
