<h2 id=what-are-the-prerequisites-for-the-transportation-of-biomedical-waste>What are the prerequisites for the transportation of biomedical waste?</h2>
<p>Vehicles or containers used for transporting health-care waste should not be used for transporting non-waste material. Vehicles should be kept locked at all times, except when loading and unloading, If needed the vehicles can be repositioned for general use, but inside of the trucks must be disinfected.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-medical-waste-truck>What is a medical waste truck?</h2>
<p>The Medical Waste Vehicle was custom designed to the customer’s specifications to dispose of hospital waste in a safe and environmentally proper manner. The Medical Waste Vehicle utilizes large on-board power systems for grinding and chemically neutralizing all bio hazard waste products from hospitals.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-four-types-of-medical-waste>What are the four types of medical waste?</h2>
<p>There are generally 4 different kinds of medical waste: infectious, hazardous, radioactive, and general. We wanted to take some time today to discuss the differences between the four.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-medical-nuclear-waste>What is medical nuclear waste?</h2>
<p>Medical radioactive waste includes waste generated by nuclear medicine, radiation oncology, and PET. Radioactive waste must be segregated from other waste materials in clearly marked containers. When practical, minimize the amount of radioactive waste generated by surveying items before putting them into waste.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-medical-waste-treated>How is medical waste treated?</h2>
<p>The primary methods of treating medical waste are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Incineration.</li>
<li>Autoclaves.</li>
<li>Mechanical/Chemical Disinfection.</li>
<li>Microwave.</li>
<li>Irradiation.</li>
<li>Vitrification.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=is-uranium-used-in-the-medical-field>Is uranium used in the medical field?</h2>
<p>Uranium is mainly used as fuel in nuclear power reactors for electricity generation. Beyond providing about 14% of the world’s electricity, there are many major other uses of uranium through the production of radio-isotopes, including: Medicine: radio-isotopes are used for diagnosis and research.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-drivers-trained-to-transport-radioactive-materials>How are drivers trained to transport radioactive materials?</h2>
<p>Drivers who transport radioactive material are trained in basic radiation science and in radiation emergency safety. Safety and training practices make sure that the materials and packages are handled properly so that they cannot harm workers, the public, or the environment.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-become-a-hazmat-driver-truckers-training>How to become a hazmat driver-Truckers training?</h2>
<p>Furthermore, HazMat hauling firms require a High School Diploma or GED as a standard of basic education necessary for the field. Above average applicants have some form of HazMat handling experience. Superior candidates will have Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) training or certification.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-dispose-of-nuclear-waste>What’s the best way to dispose of nuclear waste?</h2>
<p>Two main waste management strategies exist across the world: some countries have been recycling used nuclear fuel for decades; others have opted for direct disposal. This is fundamentally a strategic decision, taken at a national level and mainly driven by political and economic, as well as technological, considerations.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-hazardous-waste-transporter-not-transport-hazardous-waste>Can a hazardous waste transporter not transport hazardous waste?</h2>
<p>A transporter is forbidden from transporting hazardous waste if they do not have an ID number. Unlike generator EPA ID numbers, which are site-specific, transporter ID numbers are assigned to the transportation company as a whole.</p>
