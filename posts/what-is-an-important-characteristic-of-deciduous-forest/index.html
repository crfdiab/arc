<h2 id=what-is-an-important-characteristic-of-deciduous-forest>What is an important characteristic of deciduous forest?</h2>
<p>Deciduous forests have a long, warm growing season as one of four distinct seasons. There is abundant moisture. The soil typically is rich. The leaves dropped from trees provide a steady source of organic material for the soil.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-deciduous-forests-used-for>What are deciduous forests used for?</h2>
<p>Humans have exploited deciduous woodlands for goods and services for hundreds of years. Deciduous trees provide hardwood, such as oak, for construction. They also provide wood to make charcoal for fuel to heat homes and for cooking.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-ecosystem-of-the-deciduous-forest>What is the ecosystem of the deciduous forest?</h2>
<p>Deciduous forest, vegetation composed primarily of broad-leaved trees that shed all their leaves during one season. Deciduous forest also extends into more arid regions along stream banks and around bodies of water. For the deciduous forest of tropical regions, see monsoon forest.</p>
<h2 id=why-deciduous-forest-are-economically-important>Why deciduous forest are economically important?</h2>
<p>(i) The deciduous forests of India are economically important because : Though it is a mixed forest but single species of trees grow in patches favouring the exploitation of forest resources. These forests are not too dense and therefore are easily accessible.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-types-of-deciduous-forests>What are the two types of deciduous forests?</h2>
<p>There are basically two types of tropical deciduous forests: Moist and Dry Deciduous forests. Dry Deciduous forests are found on the Northern part of India and South Deccan plateau.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-humans-impact-deciduous-forests>How do humans impact deciduous forests?</h2>
<p>Logging, conversion of the land into agriculture, deforestation for housing development, forest fires, and farming are all examples of how humans impact the deciduous forest. If people continue to do logging and deforestation, eventually, the trees may become endangered.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-economically-most-important-forest>Which is the economically most important forest?</h2>
<p>Economically the most important forests of India are Tropical deciduous forest. As per the economic resource pooling of India, the tropical Deciduous forests are the best ones in terms of export, import and revenue.</p>
<h2 id=which-forests-are-economically-useful>Which forests are economically useful?</h2>
<p>Answer: The tropical deciduous forests in India is the most important commercial forests. They are considered the best in terms of trade and revenue generation. Explanation: These forests are comparatively less dense so timber can be easily extracted.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-main-categories-of-forest>What are the two main categories of forest?</h2>
<p>Answer: Two types of deciduous forests are the moist deciduous forests and the dry deciduous forests. The moist deciduous forests: Sal and Teak. The dry deciduous forests: Khair and Axle wood.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-main-types-of-trees>What are the two main types of trees?</h2>
<p>Broadly, trees are grouped into two primary categories: deciduous and coniferous.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-deforestation-affecting-the-deciduous-forest-biome>How is deforestation affecting the deciduous forest biome?</h2>
<p>The practice of deforestation has been threatening the existence of deciduous forests around the world. These forests are dwindling as large tracts of land are being cleared for farming and human habitation. The need of the hour is to spread awareness about the need to protect this – and all the other forest biomes.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-forests-so-important-to-the-environment>Why are forests so important to the environment?</h2>
<p>The importance of forests cannot be underestimated. We depend on forests for our survival, from the air we breathe to the wood we use. Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, forests also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-deciduous-forest>What was the purpose of the deciduous forest?</h2>
<p>Since the settlements of the first settlers took place from Europe, Deciduous Forests have much been cleared for development of cities, towns, agriculture, commercial and recreational spaces.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-animals-adapted-to-live-in-the-deciduous-forest>How are animals adapted to live in the deciduous forest?</h2>
<p>Animals living in this kind of biome have developed two types of adaptation: hibernation and migration. Hibernation is a state of inactivity. Migration is the movement of animals from freezing climatic conditions to more favorable climatic conditions. While huge arrays of birds migrate, most mammals hibernate in winter when food is inadequate.</p>
