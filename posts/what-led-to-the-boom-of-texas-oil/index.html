<h2 id=what-led-to-the-boom-of-texas-oil>What led to the boom of Texas oil?</h2>
<p>By 1940 Texas had come to dominate U.S. production. The major petroleum strikes that began the rapid growth in petroleum exploration and speculation occurred in Southeast Texas, but soon reserves were found across Texas and wells were constructed in North Texas, East Texas, and the Permian Basin in West Texas.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-discovery-of-oil-impact-life-in-texas>How did the discovery of oil impact life in Texas?</h2>
<p>The oil industry brought opportunities to Texans. Texas became the center of oil exploration and production in the nation. Many rural areas grew into cities. New types of jobs were created, and people had more time to enjoy leisure activities such as baseball.</p>

<p>Lyne T. Barret<br>
Lyne T. Barret and George Dullnig may have wished they had had better luck in the oil business. In 1866, Barret drilled the first oil-producing well in Texas near present-day Nacogdoches. He struck black gold at 106 feet and produced about ten barrels a day for a couple of years.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-oil-boom-in-texas>How big was the oil boom in Texas?</h2>
<p>Universal History Archive/Getty Images Show More Show Less 17 of 123 The first oil geyer at the Spindletop oilfield south of Beaumont produced about 100,000 barrels of oil per day, sparking Texas’ first major boom-bust cycle at the turn of the century. Beaumont’s population exploded from 10,000 to 50,000.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-oil-industry-start-in-texas>Where did the oil industry start in Texas?</h2>
<p>The modern oil industry was born on a hill in southeastern Texas. This hill was formed by a giant underground dome of salt as it moved slowly towards the surface. As it crept, it pushed the earth that was in its path higher and higher. This dome was known by several names, but the one that stuck was “Spindletop”.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spindletop-oil-field-affect-texas-history>How did the Spindletop oil field affect Texas history?</h2>
<p>The New Handbook of Texas summarizes the effect of Spindletop in this way: “The discovery of the Spindletop oil field had an almost incalculable effect on world history, as well as Texas history. Eager to find similar deposits, investors spent billions of dollars throughout the Lone Star State in search of oil and natural gas.</p>

<p>Boom periods of the four major industries that built the early Texas economy. At the start of the 20th century, agriculture, timber, and ranching were the leading economic engines of Texas. This was changed by the boom, which led to rapid industrialization.</p>
