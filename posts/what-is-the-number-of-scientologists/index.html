<h2 id=what-is-the-number-of-scientologists>What is the number of Scientologists?</h2>
<p>According to the latest survey, the total number of people who identify as Scientologists is just 25,000 in this country of more than 300 million human beings. That’s one Scientologist for about every 12,000 Americans.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-the-church-of-scientology-charge>How much does the Church of Scientology charge?</h2>
<p>In addition to courses, Scientologists must attend auditing, essentially the church’s term for therapy, which costs $800 an hour. These expensive auditing sessions can last a minimum of two and a half hours each, Remini said.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-send-mail-to-scientology>How do you send mail to Scientology?</h2>
<p>Using the burner phone, call Greta Molnar in the Scientology Central Files Department to update your address. You can reach Greta at (323) 960-3550. Their office hours are Monday through Friday from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM Pacific time.</p>
<h2 id=has-the-church-of-scientology-ever-killed-anyone>Has the Church of Scientology ever killed anyone?</h2>
<p>The most widely publicized death of one of the organization’s members was that of 36-year-old Lisa McPherson while in the care of Scientologists at the Scientology-owned Fort Harrison Hotel, in Clearwater, Florida, in 1995.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-most-scientologists-live>Where do most Scientologists live?</h2>
<p>Los Angeles, California, has the largest concentration of Scientologists and Scientology-related organizations in the world, with the church’s most visible presence being in the Hollywood district of the city.</p>
<h2 id=do-scientologists-celebrate-christmas>Do Scientologists celebrate Christmas?</h2>
<p>Scientologists also celebrate holidays such as Christmas, Easter and New Year’s Eve, as well as other local celebrations. Scientologists also celebrate religious holidays depending on other religious beliefs, as Scientologists very often retain their original affiliations with religions in which they were raised.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-be-rich-to-be-a-scientologist>Do you have to be rich to be a Scientologist?</h2>
<p>No, it doesn’t make you rich. Scientology is not for everyone. Only few people in Scientology are or may be happy there. Even those who have the highest positions there don’t get paid that much, how much their work is trully worth.</p>
<h2 id=do-scientologists-leave-you-alone>Do Scientologists leave you alone?</h2>
<p>This alone is a major reason that hundreds of thousands of Scientologists have left it. Others feel trapped because they don’t want to lose their family or their livelihood. So they stay. Very few remaining Scientologists can easily leave it if they wanted to without losing the relationships they hold most dear.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-send-junk-mail>How do you send junk mail?</h2>
<p>If the “Junk Mail” happens to contain a self-addressed envelope, with or without postage, hoping you’ll send a check to them, put a short note with your address that you wish removed, and SEND THAT IN THE SELF-ADDRESSED ENVELOPE. PUT NO RETURN ADDRESS on the outside, and AFFIX NO POSTAGE.</p>
<h2 id=do-scientologists-have-funerals>Do Scientologists have funerals?</h2>
<p>Ministers of the Church are authorized worldwide to conduct funerals, weddings and other rituals for adherents. Davis said Hubbard, who died in 1986, wrote several memorial services that communicate Scientology ideals and “celebrate the life of the person who has departed his body.”</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-churches-of-scientology-located-in-the-world>Where are the churches of Scientology located in the world?</h2>
<p>Scientology Churches are located all over the world and in virtually every major city, including: Los Angeles, Pasadena, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Washington, DC, London, Berlin, Brussels, Madrid, Mexico and Johannesburg. How is the Church of Scientology structured?</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-continental-liaison-offices-of-scientology>What are the Continental Liaison Offices of Scientology?</h2>
<p>WHAT ARE SCIENTOLOGY CONTINENTAL LIAISON OFFICES? Within the hierarchy of the Church of Scientology is a network of Continental Liaison Offices (CLOs) responsible for coordinating Scientology activities on regional and local levels.</p>
