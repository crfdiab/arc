<h2 id=what-did-canada-west-do>What did Canada West do?</h2>
<p>This opened up huge nearby markets for Canadian grain, lumber, fruit, textiles and machinery. By 1852, the population of Canada West had grown to about 950,000 people. This made it larger than Canada East, which had about 890,000 people.</p>
<h2 id=what-resources-were-in-canada-west>What resources were in Canada West?</h2>
<p>There was also an economic expansion on natural resources such as copper, coil, and iron. Copper, and later nickel became Sudbury’s main wealth, mineral and fossil fuel productions became huge. Immigrants came to Sudbury for farms and mines.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-canada-west-region-important-to-canada>Why was the Canada West region important to Canada?</h2>
<p>Canada West was settled primarily by English-speaking immigrants. The inhabitants nevertheless sought confederation with Canada East (which was populated largely by French-speaking Canadians) in order to secure the unified government needed for effective administration and commercial prosperity.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-people-in-canada-do-up-north>What do people in Canada do up north?</h2>
<p>“Up north” doesn’t mean Nunavut, but rather Muskoka, Shawnigan Lake, or the Laurentians. From June to August, wholesome, patriotic Canadians will pile into cars, instinctively longing for the feeling of lake water lapping against their dangling toes. It’s one of those things Canadians do.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-living-in-canada>What do you need to know about living in Canada?</h2>
<p>Living in Canada offers a wide range of experiences depending on the path you choose. Canadian culture and everything else you need to know about the Great White North are covered in this section: from practical information, to driving, culture and etiquette, public transportation, and more. Need to move abroad?</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-things-people-do-in-canada>What are some things people do in Canada?</h2>
<p>In many countries and cities, people wait as one blob of humanity where anyone around can touch or rob you, but in Canada there is an unspoken and unwritten rule — you line up instead. Pro: It’s more difficult for weirdos to start talking to you while waiting. Con: If you’re the weirdo, it’s more difficult to engage in conversation with strangers.</p>
