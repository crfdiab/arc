<h2 id=what-planet-has-the-shortest-sunrise-and-sunset>What planet has the shortest sunrise and sunset?</h2>
<p>Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by a sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets.</p>
<h2 id=which-planet-has-shortest-year>Which planet has shortest year?</h2>
<p>Mercury<br>
Mercury is an extreme planet in several respects. Because of its nearness to the Sun—its average orbital distance is 58 million km (36 million miles)—it has the shortest year (a revolution period of 88 days) and receives the most intense solar radiation of all the planets.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-time-between-sunrise-and-sunset-called>What is the time between sunrise and sunset called?</h2>
<p>Twilight<br>
Twilight is the time period between (astronomical) dawn and sunrise, or between sunset and (astronomical) dusk.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-sunset-get-later-faster-than-sunrise>Why does sunset get later faster than sunrise?</h2>
<p>The Earth’s orbit around the Sun is elliptical, rather than circular, and the Earth’s axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. This non-circularity of the orbit and the tilt of the Earth’s axis of rotation both contribute to the uneven changes in the times of sunrise and sunset.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-tell-the-difference-between-a-sunrise-and-sunset>Can you tell the difference between a sunrise and sunset?</h2>
<p>Sunrises and sunsets can appear identical as there is no difference in the light coming from the sun itself at those times and it passes through the same distance of atmosphere. This can lead to a redder colour in the sunset, but this is hard to detect.</p>
<h2 id=do-days-get-longer-evenly>Do days get longer evenly?</h2>
<p>The amount of time between sunrise and solar noon remains more or less the same as the amount of time between solar noon and sunset. Thus, the days get longer but the Sun actually only rises a little bit earlier every day and still reaches its highest point in the sky at midday.</p>
<h2 id=is-sunrise-quicker-than-sunset>Is sunrise quicker than sunset?</h2>
<p>sunrises are much quicker than sunsets, because the day precedes the sun, and the sky is already quite bright when the sun comes up.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-planet-closest-to-the-sun>Which is the planet closest to the Sun?</h2>
<p>Saturn is one of the most instantly recognizable of the planets. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.5 billion kilometers (9.5 times the distance between the Earth and our star). The Sun’s rays are refracted by the abundance of water ice crystals and gases, creating incredible images such as the ’false sun’ seen here.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-sunrise-look-like-on-different-planets>What does Sunrise look like on different planets?</h2>
<p>What sunrise looks like on different planets 1 Mercury. 2 Venus. 3 Mars. 4 Jupiter. 5 Saturn. 6 Uranus. 7 Neptune. 8 Pluto.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-sunrise-and-sunset-times-in-the-world>What are the sunrise and sunset times in the world?</h2>
<p>May 2021 — Sun in The World 2021 Sunrise/Sunset Sunrise/Sunset Daylength Daylength May Sunrise Sunset Length Diff. 1 5:43 am ↑ (73°) 6:49 pm ↑ (287°) 13:06:20 +1:15 2 5:42 am ↑ (73°) 6:50 pm ↑ (288°) 13:07:35 +1:14 3 5:41 am ↑ (72°) 6:50 pm ↑ (288°) 13:08:48 +1:13</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-sun-compared-to-our-planet>How big is the Sun compared to our planet?</h2>
<p>The distance to our star is 4.5 billion kilometers (or 30 times that between the Earth and the Sun). Huge geysers of dust and gas on this icy satellite eclipse the tiny disc of light suspended in a dark starry sky. From the perspective of the most distant planet in our solar system, the Sun is little more than a tiny shining point of light.</p>
