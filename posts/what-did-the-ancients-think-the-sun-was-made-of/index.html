<h2 id=what-did-the-ancients-think-the-sun-was-made-of>What did the ancients think the Sun was made of?</h2>
<p>Anaxagoras (510-428 BCE) is credited with being the first to realize that the Moon reflects the Sun’s light instead of shining by itself. He was, accordingly, able to give a correct explanation for eclipses. Anaxagoras thought that the Sun is made of red hot metal and that the moon is made of earth.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-ancients-worship-the-sun>Why did the ancients worship the Sun?</h2>
<p>The sun is often a prime attribute of or is identified with the Supreme Deity. The sun was one of the most popular deities, however, among the Indo-European peoples and was a symbol of divine power to them. Surya is glorified in the Vedas of ancient India as an all-seeing god who observes both good and evil actions.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-ancients-think-the-moon-was>What did the ancients think the moon was?</h2>
<p>Through persistent observation, Anaxagoras came to believe that the moon was a rock, not totally unlike the Earth, and he even described mountains on the lunar surface. The sun, he thought, was a burning rock.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-ancients-know-about-planets>Did the ancients know about planets?</h2>
<p>Five planets — Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were known to the ancients. To the unaided eye, these planets appear starlike. However, the planets moved relative to the stars.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-goddess-of-sun>Who is the goddess of Sun?</h2>
<p>Amaterasu<br>
Amaterasu, also known as Amaterasu-Ōmikami (天照大御神, 天照大神) or Ōhirume-no-Muchi-no-Kami (大日孁貴神) among other names, is the goddess of the sun in Japanese mythology. One of the major deities (kami) of Shinto, she is also portrayed in Japan’s earliest literary texts, the Kojiki (ca.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-romans-call-the-moon>What did the Romans call the moon?</h2>
<p>Luna<br>
In ancient Roman religion and myth, Luna is the divine embodiment of the Moon (Latin luna; cf. English “lunar”).</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-ancients-call-the-planets>What did the ancients call the planets?</h2>
<p>Five planets — Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were known to the ancients. However, the planets moved relative to the stars. For this reason they were called wandering stars.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-sun-provide-spiritually>What does the sun provide spiritually?</h2>
<p>The Sun is one of the best energy sources for persons spiritual, that is for his mental body. If you spend time in the Sun, then it will charge you, you are like a solar panel that restores vitality in itself and lets its spiritual body recover.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-ancient-egyptians-believe-about-the-sun>What did the ancient Egyptians believe about the Sun?</h2>
<p>The Egyptians did not believe that the sun and stars were bodies in space, instead believing that they were gods that lived in the sky during the day and died each time they left the sky. The sun, moon, and stars would travel through their afterlife, called the Duat, and be born again each time they reappeared (Parker, 55-56).</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-ancient-god-of-the-sun>Who was the ancient god of the Sun?</h2>
<p>One of my favorite ancient civilizations is the Inca, and just like many other before them, they too developed powerful worship of the Sun god. The Inca culture, which settled in what is now Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, part of Chile, and Argentina, had a Sun god called Inti, and it was one of their most important deities.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-sun-important-to-the-indians>Why was the Sun important to the Indians?</h2>
<p>The sun was one of the most popular deities, however, among the Indo-European peoples and was a symbol of divine power to them. Surya is glorified in the Vedas of ancient India as an all-seeing god who observes both good and evil actions.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-ancient-people-believe-about-the-moon>What did ancient people believe about the Moon?</h2>
<p>As often as with the sun, the moon was also associated with birth, death, resurrection and with fertility symbol. The moon was believed to control water, our dreams and especially its dark side was connected to the occult.</p>
