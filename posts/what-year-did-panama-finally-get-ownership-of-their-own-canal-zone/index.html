<h2 id=what-year-did-panama-finally-get-ownership-of-their-own-canal-zone>What year did Panama finally get ownership of their own canal zone?</h2>
<p>On December 31, 1999, the United States, in accordance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, officially hands over control of the Panama Canal, putting the strategic waterway into Panamanian hands for the first time.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-panama-canal-zone-acquired>When was the Panama Canal Zone acquired?</h2>
<p>May 4, 1904<br>
The Canal Zone came into being on May 4, 1904 (“Acquisition Day”), under the terms of the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903 by which Panama granted to the United States, in return for annual payments, the sole right to operate and control the canal and about 5 miles (8 km) of land on each side.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-us-still-own-the-panama-canal>Does the US still own the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>The United States took over the project on May 4, 1904 and opened the canal on August 15, 1914. After a period of joint American–Panamanian control, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government in 1999. It is now managed and operated by the government-owned Panama Canal Authority.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-panama-canal-transferred-to-panama>When was the Panama Canal transferred to Panama?</h2>
<p>On 1 October 1979, the day the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 took effect, most of the land within the former Canal Zone was transferred to Panama. However, the treaty set aside many Canal Zone areas and facilities for transfer during the following 20 years.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-panama-canal-zone-part-of-the-united-states>Is the Panama Canal Zone part of the United States?</h2>
<p>Although the Panama Canal Zone was legal territory of the United States until the implementation of the Torrijos–Carter Treaties in 1979, questions arose almost from its inception as to whether it was considered part of the United States for constitutional purposes, or, in the phrase of the day, whether the Constitution followed the flag.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-in-charge-of-building-the-panama-canal>Who was in charge of building the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>Following heated debate over the location of the proposed canal, on June 19, 1902, the U.S. Senate voted in favor of building the canal through Panama. Within 6 months, Secretary of State John Hay signed a treaty with Colombian Foreign Minister Tomás Herrán to build the new canal.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-united-states-recognize-panama-as-a-country>When did the United States recognize Panama as a country?</h2>
<p>Other Colombian forces were discouraged from marching on Panama by the arrival of the U.S. warship Nashville. On November 6, the United States recognized the Republic of Panama, and on November 18 the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty was signed with Panama, granting the United States exclusive and permanent possession of the Panama Canal Zone.</p>
