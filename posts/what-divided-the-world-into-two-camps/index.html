<h2 id=what-divided-the-world-into-two-camps>What divided the world into two camps?</h2>
<p>The United States and the USSR gradually built up their own zones of influence, dividing the world into two opposing camps. The Cold War was therefore not exclusively a struggle between the US and the USSR but a global conflict that affected many countries, particularly the continent of Europe.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-blocs-was-europe-divided-into-after-ww2>What two blocs was Europe divided into after ww2?</h2>
<p>Europe became divided into the Eastern Bloc of nations and the West. The Eastern Bloc was led and controlled by the Soviet Union (Russia). The Western countries, including the United States, formed an alliance against communism called NATO.</p>

<h2 id=what-ended-in-1991>What ended in 1991?</h2>
<p>During 1989 and 1990, the Berlin Wall came down, borders opened, and free elections ousted Communist regimes everywhere in eastern Europe. In late 1991 the Soviet Union itself dissolved into its component republics. With stunning speed, the Iron Curtain was lifted and the Cold War came to an end.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-divided-during-the-cold-war>Who was divided during the Cold War?</h2>

<h2 id=why-did-the-united-states-and-the-soviet-union-became-rivals-after-world-war-2>Why did the United States and the Soviet Union became rivals after World war 2?</h2>

The latter had Hungarian, Serbian, Bosnian and Croats etc who spoke different languages and cultural traditions. In order to secure their interests, nations entered into various alliances.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-world-split-into-two-camps>When does the world split into two camps?</h2>
<p>The Duhaima (September the 11th) is the Fitnah that will sort people out into two camps until the time of the Dajjal (Allah’s curse be upon him), and will only end when He emerges because He will take control of the camp of hypocrites and attack the camp of Religion trying to destroy them and religion completely.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-war-break-out-in-europe-in-1914>Why did war break out in Europe in 1914?</h2>
<p>Look at ‘Why were there two armed camps in Europe in 1914?’ for long and medium term causes of the First World war. Tension had been rising between the European powers for many years. The events that took place in Sarajevo in 1914, unleashed a series of events that finally lighted a fuse which would explode into the First World War.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-struggle-between-the-two-camps>What is the struggle between the two camps?</h2>
<p>The struggle between these two camps constitutes the hub of present-day affairs, determines the whole substance of the present home and foreign policies of the leaders of the old and the new worlds.</p>
