<h2 id=are-you-supposed-to-leave-fish-in-bag-for-a-while-when-you-out-in-tank>Are you supposed to leave fish in bag for a while when you out in tank?</h2>
<p>You want to put the bag with the fish, in the aquarium right when you get home. This way, the water in the bag will slowly reach the temperature of the water in the tank. This should take no more than 30 minutes, at which point it is OK to allow the fish into the tank (more on transporting a fish safely here).</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-fish-have-to-stay-in-the-bag-in-the-tank>How long do fish have to stay in the bag in the tank?</h2>
<p>fifteen to twenty minutes<br>
When you get home with the fish, put the plastic bag holding the fish in your aquarium and let it float unopened for fifteen to twenty minutes. You may want to take some of this time to re-arrange the decorations in your tank.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-keep-a-goldfish-alive-in-a-bag>How do you keep a goldfish alive in a bag?</h2>
<p>Ideal water temperature is about 70 degrees. Place the goldfish in its bag in the tank before releasing the fish to avoid more stress. Goldfish, members of the carp family, produce a lot of waste, so you will also need a filtering system. The waste contains ammonia, which is toxic to them.</p>
<h2 id=is-plastic-bad-for-goldfish>Is plastic bad for goldfish?</h2>
<p>When plastics are left in water for long periods of time they can release potentially toxic chemicals into the water, so they should be avoided in fish tanks at all costs. Unsealed, painted plastic toys will release toxins into the water which could poison your fish.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-put-fish-in-ziplock-bags>Can you put fish in ziplock bags?</h2>
<p>Do you wonder if you can transport fish in a ziplock bag? The answer is yes, but a fish must not stay inside a Ziplock bag for more than 30 minutes. It’s also crucial that the bag is clean, and doesn’t have any holes. Make sure it is the biggest ziplock size, and don’t put more than one fish in the bag.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-goldfish-to-settle-in>How long does it take for goldfish to settle in?</h2>
<p>For any fish, it takes around 2-7 days for it to acclimate to the tank.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-transport-fish-in-tupperware>Can you transport fish in Tupperware?</h2>
<p>Especially small containers will run out of oxygen faster, so you must not keep your fish in small Tupperware containers. If you are keeping your fish in Tupperware, make sure that the container is large, with plenty of space for air and water, if you want to keep the fish in it for longer than an hour.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-transport-fish-in-a-ziploc-bag>Can I transport fish in a Ziploc bag?</h2>
<h2 id=what-do-goldfish-like-in-their-tanks>What do goldfish like in their tanks?</h2>
<p>Goldfish like plants, variety in their food, a large, clean tank with a stress-free environment, lots of oxygen in their tank, nice cold soft water, other Goldfish as mates and some decorations in their tank.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-carnival-fish-die-so-fast>Why do Carnival fish die so fast?</h2>
<p>The fish get poisoned form still water; their waste hanging around can add ammonia into the water. Another factor is the stress of being stuck at a limited place, unable to move freely.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-okay-to-put-fish-in-a-plastic-storage-box>Is it okay to put fish in a plastic storage box?</h2>
<p>Plastic Containers can deteriorate over time and using food grade containers ensures that nothin too toxic harms the fish. 2,4,5 are food grade plastics while others should be avoided to maximize the safety and health of your fish. It is quite common for fish keepers to use plastic totes in the hobby.</p>
<h2 id=is-number-5-plastic-fish-safe>Is number 5 plastic fish safe?</h2>
<p>#5 plastics are Polypropylene. Polypropylene plastics have a high tolerance to heat, so many microwavable containers are made of polypropylene. The only food grade plastic that I would avoid for aquarium use are #1 plastics.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-can-a-goldfish-stay-in-a-breather-bag>How long can a goldfish stay in a breather bag?</h2>
<p>1 Goldfish or koi should not be kept in a regular plastic, air-filled bag for longer than 9 hours. 2 If the bag is a breather bag, the fish can safely stay in the bag for up to 48 hours. More …</p>
<h2 id=why-do-i-put-a-plastic-bag-in-my-goldfish-tank>Why do I put a plastic bag in my Goldfish tank?</h2>
<p>Acclimation The reason for floating the plastic bag in the tank when bringing home your new goldfish is to let him slowly acclimate to the new tank temperature. Dumping him into water that is cooler or warmer than his current surroundings could cause him to go into shock and is hard on his little body.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-do-with-my-new-goldfish>What should I do with my new goldfish?</h2>
<p>Rapid changes in light can stress your new goldfish, so don’t carry him around in just the clear plastic bag when transferring him from the store to the car and the car to the house. Place the plastic bag in a paper bag or a small ice chest.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-get-my-goldfish-out-of-the-bag>How can I get my Goldfish out of the bag?</h2>
<p>Once your goldfish is surrounded mainly by water from the tank, gently lift him out of the bag with a net and release him into the tank. Alternately, you can open the bag and release him, but you may also release any dirt or bacteria contained in the water from the store.</p>
