<h2 id=what-food-did-cahuilla-tribe-eat>What food did Cahuilla tribe eat?</h2>
<p>The Cahuilla Indians ate acorns, mushrooms, seafood, and seaweed. They also ate bread and soup made from mashed acorns. The men hunted quail, deer, desert rabbits, and other animals.</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-did-the-cahuilla-eat>What animals did the Cahuilla eat?</h2>
<p>Cahuilla men hunted deer, rabbits, and small game, and went fishing in the rivers. Cahuilla women gathered acorns, nuts, beans, and fruits. They baked bread from specially prepared acorn flour, or sometimes from corn they got in trade from the Mojaves.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-cahuilla-store-their-food>How did the Cahuilla store their food?</h2>
<p>They stored their gathered food in large baskets and pottery jars. The Cahuilla used long sticks to move the hot rocks around the cooking basket as well as in and out of the cooking basket.</p>
<h2 id=what-crops-did-the-cahuilla-tribe-grow>What crops did the Cahuilla tribe grow?</h2>
<p>Mesquite beans and pine nuts were important staples of their hunting and gathering subsistence, but some farming — corn, beans and squash (CBS) was also practiced in aboriginal times. Today, the Cahuilla live on 9 reservations in some cases with Chemehuevi (Southern Paiute), Cupeno and Serrano peoples.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-cahuilla-tribe-still-exist>Does the Cahuilla tribe still exist?</h2>
<p>Members of the Cahuilla tribe have long resided in the area of southern California where the present reservation exists. The language of the Cahuilla people belongs to the Takic branch of the Uto-Aztecan greater linguistic family. Elder reservation residents continue to speak their ancestral language.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cahuilla-tribe-known-for>What was the Cahuilla tribe known for?</h2>
<p>The Cahuilla learned of Spanish missions and their culture from Indians living close to missions in San Gabriel and San Diego. The Cahuilla provided the vaqueros that worked for the owners of the Rancho San Bernardino, and provided security against the raids of the tribes from the desert and mountains on its herds.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-cahuilla-indians-do-for-a-living>What did the Cahuilla Indians do for a living?</h2>
<p>The Cahuilla Indians focused on gathering plant food and hunting animals for food rather than farming. They are therefore referred to as “hunter-gatherers.” Hunters used bows and arrows to kill game and young boys learned how to throw a curved stick in order to hit prey such as rabbits.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-cahuilla-territory-in-southern-california>Where was the Cahuilla territory in Southern California?</h2>
<p>The traditional Cahuilla territory was near the geographic center of Southern California. It was bounded to the north by the San Bernardino Mountains, to the south by Borrego Springs and the Chocolate Mountains, to the east by the Colorado Desert, and to the west by the San Jacinto Plain and the eastern slopes of the Palomar Mountains.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-morongo-tribe-part-of-the-cahuilla-tribe>Is the Morongo tribe part of the Cahuilla tribe?</h2>
<p>The Morongo Band of Mission Indians, also considered part of the Cahuilla nation, operates the Morongo Casino Resort and Spa, as well as the Hadley Fruit Orchards in Cabazon. The Morongo Casino is one of the largest Indian casinos in the United States. The Morongo Indian Reservation is located in northern Riverside County.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-some-famous-people-from-the-cahuilla-tribe>Who are some famous people from the Cahuilla tribe?</h2>
<p>Notable Cahuilla 1 Juan Antonio (Cahuilla Band, 1783-1863), major chief of the Mountain Cahuilla 2 Marigold Linton (Morongo Band, b. 3 John Tortes “Chief” Meyers (Cahuilla Band, 1880–1971), Major League baseball catcher 4 Katherine Siva Saubel (Los Coyotes, 1920–2011), language preservationist and former tribal chairperson</p>
