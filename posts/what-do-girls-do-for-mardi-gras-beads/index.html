<h2 id=what-do-girls-do-for-mardi-gras-beads>What do girls do for Mardi Gras beads?</h2>
<p>Spectators at the carnival are traditionally supposed to shout ‘Throw me something, mister’, as a way of asking for the beads. In the French Quarter, it’s common practice for women to show their breasts as a way of getting beads chucked their way, however this isn’t often done during the Mardi Gras parades.</p>

<h2 id=what-happens-to-all-those-beads-after-mardi-gras>What happens to all those beads after Mardi Gras?</h2>
<p>Mardi Gras produces around 1.2 million pounds of garbage in fewer than 14 days. The majority of the trash is single-use plastic—cups, hats, doubloons, plastic toys, and those colorful beads—all of which can slip into storm drains or end up in Lake Pontchartrain.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-throw-beads-at-mardi-gra>Why do people throw beads at Mardi Gra?</h2>
<p>Beads used on Mardi Gras (known as Shrove Tuesday in some regions) are purple, green, and gold, with these three colors containing the Christian symbolism of justice, faith, and power, respectively.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-beads-mean-at-a-party>What do beads mean at a party?</h2>
<p>Traditional Mardi Gras beads are purple, green, and gold colors. The purple symbolizes justice; the green represents faith; and the gold signifies power. If you are participating in the Mardi Gras carnival this year or hosting your own Mardi Gras party, make sure you get plenty of colorful beads!</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-do-with-plastic-beads>What can you do with plastic beads?</h2>

<h2 id=how-do-you-recycle-beads>How do you recycle beads?</h2>
<p>Fortunately, plastic beads are recyclable. So you can simply take all those parade beads and haul them down to the recycling center. Or, if you recycle at your home, place them in the plastic recycling bin.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-they-throw-beads-in-new-orleans>Why do they throw beads in New Orleans?</h2>
<h2 id=what-do-beads-symbolize>What do beads symbolize?</h2>
<p>Beads, whether sewn on apparel or worn on strings, have symbolic meanings that are far removed from the simplistic empiricism of the Western anthropologist. They, or pendants, may for instance be protective, warding off evil spirits or spells, or they can be good luck charms.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-oldest-krewe-in-new-orleans>What is the oldest krewe in New Orleans?</h2>
<p>The Mistick Krewe of Comus<br>
The Mistick Krewe of Comus, founded in 1856, is a New Orleans, Louisiana, Carnival krewe. It is the oldest continuous organization of New Orleans Mardi Gras festivities.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-melt-beads-in-the-microwave>Can you melt beads in the microwave?</h2>
<p>Most plastic beads, like pony beads, do not like high heat. If one of these beads ends up in the microwave for too long, not only will you have ruined beads, but also a ruined microwave. Plastic easily melts in high heat, especially the microwave. The heat melts the beads, and then they all fuse together.</p>

<h2 id=why-do-women-throw-beads-at-mardi-gras>Why do women throw beads at Mardi Gras?</h2>
<p>Spectators at the carnival are traditionally supposed to shout ‘Throw me something, mister’, as a way of asking for the beads. In the French Quarter, it’s common practice for women to show their breasts as a way of getting beads chucked their way, however this isn’t often done during the Mardi Gras parades.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-with-your-family-during-mardi-gras>What to do with your family during Mardi Gras?</h2>
<p>You and your family will enjoy watching marching bands, listening to music in the air and catching free toys, doubloons and beads. You can feel the excitement in the air! While you wait for the parade, have that cotton candy and sit down on your chair or right on the ground with the rest of your family.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-women-have-to-show-their-breasts-at-mardi-gras>Why do women have to show their breasts at Mardi Gras?</h2>
<p>Because the people throwing the treasures know that, they will sometimes take advantage of women by asking them to show their breasts for them. Please tell your friend that no one has to do anything they don’t want to do, and those who request women to do so can be arrested on the parade route.</p>
