<h2 id=what-is-the-school-system-like-in-poland>What is the school system like in Poland?</h2>
<p>In Poland, compulsory education ends at the age of 18. It usually starts when children are 6 years old and ends after 12 years of learning (usually in a high school). Contemporary Polish law distinguishes between compulsory school (obowiązek szkolny) and compulsory education (obowiązek nauki).</p>

<p>Education System in Poland</p>
<table><tr><th>Primary</th><th>Primary School (Szkoła Podstawowa)</th><th>7–13</th></tr><tr><td>Middle</td><td>Basic Vocational School (Zasadnicza Szkoła Zawodowa)</td><td>16–18</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary</td><td>Technical Secondary School (Technikum)</td><td>16–20</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary</td><td>General Lyceum (Liceum Ogólnokształcące)</td><td>16–19</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary</td><td>Specialized Lyceum (Liceum Profilowane)</td><td>16–19</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-are-the-similarities-and-differences-between-schools>What are the similarities and differences between schools?</h2>
<p>The only real similarity, in my view, is that they were conducted for the purpose of educating young people. The differences between schools in these two periods are striking. First, the schools in the two eras taught about different things.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-public-schools-and-private-schools-alike>How are public schools and private schools alike?</h2>
<p>Both public and private high schools do have one key similarity: they require a certain number of credits in core subjects such as English, mathematics, and science in order to graduate. Public schools must accept all students within their jurisdiction with few exceptions. Behavior is one of those exceptions.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-polish-americans-are-there-in-the-united-states>How many Polish Americans are there in the United States?</h2>
<p>Polish Americans. Polish Americans are Americans who have total or partial Polish ancestry. There are an estimated 10.5 million self-identified Polish Americans, representing about 3% of the U.S. population.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-politics-did-polish-americans-participate-in>What kind of politics did Polish Americans participate in?</h2>
<p>Poles became active members of the liberal New Deal Coalition from the 1930s to the 1960s, but since then, many have moved to the suburbs, and have become more conservative and vote less often Democratic. Outside of Republican and Democratic politics, politics such as those of Agudath Israel of America have heavily involved Polish-Jewish Americans.</p>
