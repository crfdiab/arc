<h2 id=what-cities-were-affected-by-mount-vesuvius>What cities were affected by Mount Vesuvius?</h2>
<p>On August 24, after centuries of dormancy, Mount Vesuvius erupts in southern Italy, devastating the prosperous Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum and killing thousands.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-cities-were-affected-by-mount-vesuvius>How many cities were affected by Mount Vesuvius?</h2>
<p>Mount Vesuvius, on the west coast of Italy, is the only active volcano on mainland Europe. It is best known because of the eruption in A.D. 79 that destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, but Vesuvius has erupted more than 50 times.</p>
<h2 id=is-naples-in-danger-from-vesuvius>Is Naples in danger from Vesuvius?</h2>
<p>Experts warn that emergency plans should also include nearby Naples since an explosion could send dangerous burning ash and pumice as far as 12 miles (20 kilometers) [source: Fraser]. Given its potential, Vesuvius could endanger more than 3 million people and wipe out the city of Naples [source: Than].</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-dangers-of-living-near-mount-vesuvius>What are the dangers of living near Mount Vesuvius?</h2>
<p>In most cases, lava flows extremely slowly and poses little threat to humans. But the addition of water into the magma chamber that houses the volcano’s lava can trigger a much more destructive pyroclastic eruption.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-at-risk-from-mount-vesuvius>How many people are at risk from Mount Vesuvius?</h2>
<p>Naples is now at risk from ‘Europe’s time bomb’: Italian city of three million people is added to the danger area threatened by eruptions from Mount Vesuvius. Half the population of Naples is now at risk from the volcano known as ‘Europe’s time bomb’.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-roman-city-that-was-destroyed-by-mount-vesuvius>What was the name of the Roman city that was destroyed by Mount Vesuvius?</h2>
<p>The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis and Stabiae, as well as several other settlements.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-for-mt-vesuvius-to-erupt-again>Is it possible for Mt Vesuvius to erupt again?</h2>
<p>Could Mount Vesuvius Erupt Again? Yes, Mount Vesuvius is considered an active volcano. It very well could erupt again. Mount Vesuvius sits on top of an extremely deep layer of magma that goes 154 miles into the earth.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-new-danger-zone-for-vesuvius>Where is the new danger zone for Vesuvius?</h2>
<p>Some 63 towns and villages were added to the new Vesuvius danger zone. The ‘yellow zone’ now reaches across the provinces of Naples and Salerno. Residents in the yellow zone would be showered with falling ash and rocks. Zone includes half of the three million residents living in the city of Naples.</p>
