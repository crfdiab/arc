<h2 id=what-do-you-know-about-the-history-of-africa>What do you know about the history of Africa?</h2>
<p>The history of Africa begins with the emergence of hominids, archaic humans and—at least 200,000 years ago—anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens), in East Africa, and continues unbroken into the present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-a-change-to-human-language-when-humans-spread-out-of-africa-group-of-answer-choices>What was a change to human language when humans spread out of Africa Group of answer choices?</h2>
<p>What was a change to human language when humans spread out of Africa? It expanded into nineteen separate language families.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-mother-of-africa>Who is the mother of Africa?</h2>
<p>Mother Africa is known by several names including Naa Jaku, Naa Yoomo, Asaase Yaa, the Human Spirit, and the Mother of the Human Race.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-diffusion-of-languages-take-place>How did the diffusion of languages take place?</h2>
<p>Schleicher’s idea has stood the test of time and criticism, and the language-tree model remains central to language research (Figure 9-1). A complicating factor is that with human mobility, languages did not merely diffuse through static populations; they also spread by relocation diffusion (see Chapter 2).</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-history-of-africa-come-from>Where did the history of Africa come from?</h2>
<p>Most historians think Africa’s history started with the Bantu peoples, A group of African language speakers (Bantu languages) that originally lived in the notch of western Africa. In around 1500 B.C.E., the Bantu speakers stumbled upon the domestication of yams and bananas. Just like wheat did in Mesopotamia and Egypt…</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-bantu-people-spread-their-knowledge>How did the Bantu people spread their knowledge?</h2>
<p>Most often, A Bantu language is the official language in an African country. Other languages are often considered inferior. In about 1500 B.C.E., a group of Bantu language speakers discovered that they could domesticate yams and bananas. They used their new food to increase their population and then spread their knowledge to all of Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-language-invented-in-africa>What was the first language invented in Africa?</h2>
<p>N’Ko, invented in 1949 by Solomana Kante in Guinea, primarily for the Manding languages. It is apparently in increasing use in West Africa, including some efforts to adapt it to other languages (Wyrod 2008). The Vai syllabary invented by Mɔmɔlu Duwalu Bukɛlɛ for the Vai language in what is now Liberia during the early 19th century.</p>
