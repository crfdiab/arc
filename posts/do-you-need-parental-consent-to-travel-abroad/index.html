<h2 id=do-you-need-parental-consent-to-travel-abroad>Do you need parental consent to travel abroad?</h2>
<p>Parental consent forms aren’t required for all international destinations or for travel within the U.S., but the U.S. Department of State recommends that a child carries one if he is not traveling with his parents or if he is traveling with only one parent. There is no official consent form, so you must type your own.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-need-a-letter-to-travel-with-my-son>Do I need a letter to travel with my son?</h2>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) strongly recommends that unless the child is accompanied by both parents, the adult have a note from the child’s other parent (or, in the case of a child traveling with grandparents, uncles or aunts, sisters or brothers, friends, or in groups*, a note signed by both parents) …</p>
<h2 id=can-i-travel-internationally-with-my-kids>Can I travel internationally with my kids?</h2>
<p>Unless they’re accompanied by both parents, any child under the age of 18 traveling internationally must have: A valid passport and any necessary visas. Notarized permission note from both parents.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-need-permission-from-my-ex-to-take-child-abroad>Do I need permission from my ex to take child abroad?</h2>
<p>If one parent alone has parental responsibility, and there is no court order, the permission of the other parent is not strictly necessary. A father without parental responsibility can ask the court to grant him parental responsibility and could then object to the child being taken abroad.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-divorced-parent-travel-with-their-child-out-of-state>Can a divorced parent travel with their child out of State?</h2>
<p>After divorce, traveling with your minor child out of state isn’t always as easy. Before doing so, you may need to get permission from the other parent or a judge. Whether you need written permission depends on your custody and visitation orders.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-parent-travel-with-their-child-without-a-consent-form>Can a parent travel with their child without a consent form?</h2>
<p>A parent who is traveling with their own child, who is not bound by other legal requirements (i.e., custody agreement) may travel with their child without a consent form. It is advised that a parent carries a copy of their birth certificate if the child does not have a state-issued identification.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-parent-with-sole-custody-travel-with-their-child>Can a parent with sole custody travel with their child?</h2>
<p>To avoid delays or being refused entry or exit at the border, it’s safest to have a travel consent letter signed by the other parent. Even if you have sole custody, you may still be required to show that you have permission of your partner or anyone else that has access to your child, to travel with your child.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-parental-permission-to-take-a-child-abroad>Do you need parental permission to take a child abroad?</h2>
<p>You automatically have parental responsibility if you’re the child’s mother, but you still need the permission of anyone else with parental responsibility before you take the child abroad. You can take a child abroad for 28 days without getting permission if a child arrangement order says…</p>
