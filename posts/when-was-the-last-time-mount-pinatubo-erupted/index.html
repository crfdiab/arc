<p>June 15, 1991<br>
Mount Pinatubo/Last eruption</p>
<p>From July to October 1992, a lava dome was built in the new caldera as fresh magma rose from deep beneath Pinatubo. Even after more than 5 years, hazardous effects from the June 15,1991, climactic eruption of Mount Pinatubo continue.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-mt-pinatubo-ash-fall-last>How long did Mt Pinatubo ash fall last?</h2>
<p>It lasted about five minutes, and the eruption column once again reached 24 km (15 mi). After three hours of quiet, seismic activity began, growing more and more intense over the next twenty-four hours, until a three-minute eruptive blast generated a 21 km (13 mi) high eruption column at 13:09 on June 14.</p>

<p>Pinatubo would not erupt soon, residents must take precautions as this data only shows there is volcanic activity. “Take extra caution when entering the Pinatubo crater, and one should only go there when necessary,” he said. He also pointed out that while it may take many years before Mt.</p>

Nightly News, 1991: Mount Pinatubo erupts in the Philippines.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-times-has-the-pinatubo-volcano-erupted>How many times has the Pinatubo volcano erupted?</h2>
<p>Pinatubo has had at least 6 periods of activity with large explosive eruptions in its past 35,000 years prior to the 1991 eruption. The 1991 eruption in this context actually ranks as one of the smaller eruptions. An eruption, which occurred 35,000 years ago and probably created the caldera, was likely much bigger.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-was-the-peak-of-mount-pinatubo>How tall was the peak of Mount Pinatubo?</h2>
<p>Mount Pinatubo is located about 55 miles (90 km) northwest of Manila and rose to a height of about 4,800 feet (1,460 m) prior to its eruption.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-larger-mount-st-helens-or-pinatubo>Which is larger Mount St Helens Or Pinatubo?</h2>
<p>The June 15, 1991 eruption was probably the second largest explosive eruption of the 20th century, second in size only to the Katmai 1912 eruption in Alaska. It was about ten times larger than the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-evacuation-of-mount-pinatubo-located>Where was the evacuation of Mount Pinatubo located?</h2>
<p>The ashfalls forced the evacuation and eventual closing of U.S.-leased Clark Air Force Base, 10 miles (16 km) east of the volcano. Mount Pinatubo, Philippines. What is the highest mountain range in South America? In which country are the Southern Alps located?</p>

<p>Much weaker but still spectacular eruptions of ash occurred occassionally through early September 1991. From July to October 1992, a lava dome was built in the new caldera as fresh magma rose from deep beneath Pinatubo. Even after more than 5 years, hazardous effects from the June 15,1991, climactic eruption of Mount Pinatubo continue.</p>

<p>Mount Pinatubo. The eruption column of Mount Pinatubo on June 12, 1991, three days before the climactic eruption. Highest point. Elevation. 1,486 m (4,875 ft) (current) 1,745 m (5,725 ft) (before 1991 eruption) Listing. List of active volcanoes in the Philippines. Coordinates.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-mount-pinatubo-affect-the-climate-of-the-philippines>How did Mount Pinatubo affect the climate of the Philippines?</h2>
<p>…1991 the moderate eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines provided a peak forcing of approximately –4 watts per square metre and cooled the climate by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) over the following few years. By comparison, the 1815 Mount Tambora eruption in present-day Indonesia, typically implicated for the…</p>

<p>Pinatubo is most notorious for its Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) 6 eruption on June 15, 1991, the second-largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century after the 1912 eruption of Novarupta in Alaska.</p>
