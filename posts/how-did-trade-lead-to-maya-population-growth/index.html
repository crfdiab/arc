<h2 id=how-did-trade-lead-to-maya-population-growth>How did trade lead to Maya population growth?</h2>
<p>Why did trade lead to Mayan population growth? Villages began trading with one another, and trade helped support larger populations so villages grew. Increased warfare could have brought the decline of the Maya civilization. Or, as cities grew, the Maya might not have been able to grow enough food to feed everyone.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-mayans-grow-and-trade>What did the Mayans grow and trade?</h2>
<p>Chief staples of Maya economic activities were centered primarily around foods like fish, squash, yams, corn, honey, beans, turkey, vegetables, chocolate drinks; raw materials such as limestone, marble, jade, wood, copper and gold; and manufactured goods such as paper, books, furniture, jewelry, clothing, carvings.</p>
<h2 id=what-led-to-the-rise-of-the-mayan-civilization>What led to the rise of the Mayan civilization?</h2>
<p>The Mayan cities had become so rich from trade, so powerful, and so large that they formed into city-states. They had lots of agriculture, complex trade networks, innovative architecture, and sophisticated religion. In this time, the population of Maya people entered the millions.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-the-mayans-trade-with-and-what-did-they-trade>Who did the Mayans trade with and what did they trade?</h2>
<p>Merchants traded cacao beans throughout Mesoamerica not only in the Maya lands but also to the Olmec, Zapotec, Aztecs and elsewhere. Merchants also traded in raw materials including jade, copper, gold, granite, marble, limestone and wood.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-food-did-the-maya-use-for-trade>What type of food did the Maya use for trade?</h2>
<p>Corn became a staple food and major trade commodity. With increased trade came wealth and the growth of cities into large urban-states, like those of the Classic Maya civilization. Although their principal crop was corn, farmers also cultivated beans, squash, and fruit trees.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-important-trade-for-the-mayans>What was the most important trade for the Mayans?</h2>
<p>The Obsidian Trade. Obsidian was a precious commodity to the Maya, who used it for adornments, weapons, and rituals. Of all of the trade items favored by the ancient Maya, obsidian is the most promising for reconstructing their trade routes and habits.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-a-major-influence-on-the-mayan-civilization>Who was a major influence on the Mayan civilization?</h2>
<p>The Mayan Civilization was influenced most by two other civilizations, the Olmecs and the Aztecs. The Olmecs and the Aztecs both conquered the Mayans and during their rule of the Mayans they taught them a great many things.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-mayans-get-their-jade-from>Where did the Mayans get their jade from?</h2>
<p>The nearest source of jade to this monument was many miles away in present-day Guatemala, near the Maya city of Quiriguá. Obsidian was a precious commodity to the Maya, who used it for adornments, weapons, and rituals.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-mayan-empire-collapse-in-the-post-classic-period>Why did the Mayan empire collapse in the Post Classic period?</h2>
<p>The Mayan Empire declined in the Post-Classic period for many reasons. The total Maya system collapsed because of non-ecological, ecological, and long-term economical causes. Some dangerous ecological causes of the Mayan decline are earthquakes, hurricanes, and volcanic eruptions. These destroyed the Mayan villages completely leaving nothing.</p>
