<h2 id=how-did-jean-baptiste-colbert-strengthen-the-french-economy>How did Jean Baptiste Colbert strengthen the French economy?</h2>
<p>In a mercantilist age Colbert was the supreme mercantilist. His program was to build up the economic strength of France by creating and protecting French industries, encouraging exports, and restricting imports (especially of luxury goods).</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jean-baptiste-colbert-do-for-france>What did Jean Baptiste Colbert do for France?</h2>
<p>Jean-Baptiste Colbert 1619-1683 Considered an accomplished manager, he was responsible for developing trade, industry and the merchant navy, modernising Paris, and backing new advances in the sciences. Colbert was one of Louis XIV’s most trusted advisers and stayed in constant contact with the King.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-cardinal-richelieu-do-to-increase-the-power-of-the-bourbon-monarchy>What did Cardinal Richelieu do to increase the power of the Bourbon monarchy?</h2>
<p>Richelieu took two steps to increase the power of the Bourbon monarchy. First, he moved against Huguenots. Richelieu ordered nobles to take down their fortified castles. He increased the power of government agents who came from the middle class.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-colbert-in-france>Who is Colbert in France?</h2>
<p>Jean-Baptiste Colbert<br>
Who was Jean-Baptiste Colbert? Colbert was a French statesman who served King Louis XIV during the 17th Century. He earned the nickname “The Great Colbert” for economic reforms he put in place as France expanded its colonial empire overseas.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-colberts-actions-help-balance-trade>How did Colbert’s actions help balance trade?</h2>
<p>Colbert’s idea was a “favorable balance of trade” in which goods were exported for gold, versus an “unfavorable balance of trade” in which gold would flow out of the country. Colbert also intended to get rid of internal tariffs, and to tax the nobility, but failed.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-catholic-cardinal-richelieu-fight-on-the-side-of-the-protestants>Why did the Catholic Cardinal Richelieu fight on the side of the Protestants?</h2>
<p>This early decision to support a Protestant canton against the pope was a foretaste of the purely diplomatic power politics he would espouse in his foreign policy. To further consolidate power in France, Richelieu sought to suppress the influence of the feudal nobility.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-fronde-in-france>What was the Fronde in France?</h2>
<p>The Fronde (French pronunciation: ​[fʁɔ̃d]) was a series of civil wars in France between 1648 and 1653, occurring in the midst of the Franco-Spanish War, which had begun in 1635. The Fronde represented the final attempt of the French nobility to do battle with the king, and they were humiliated.</p>
<h2 id=is-baptiste-french>Is Baptiste French?</h2>
<p>What is Baptiste about? Baptiste follows a French private investigator Julien Baptiste, who specialises in looking for missing people. At the start of the second series of the Missing spin-off, the French detective has a hermit’s long hair and beard, is drinking heavily and pushing away his estranged wife Celia.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jean-baptiste-colbert-do-for-the-french-economy>What did Jean Baptiste Colbert do for the French economy?</h2>
<p>Colbert’s market reforms included the foundation of the Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs in 1665 to supplant the importation of Venetian glass (forbidden in 1672, as soon as the French glass manufacturing industry was on sound footing) and to encourage the technical expertise of Flemish cloth manufacturing in France.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-ancestry-did-jean-baptiste-colbert-have>What kind of ancestry did Jean Baptiste Colbert have?</h2>
<p>He claimed to have Scottish ancestry. A general (but unconfirmed) belief exists that he spent his early youth at a Jesuit college, working for a Parisian banker; as well as working for the father of Jean Chapelain .</p>
<h2 id=why-was-jean-baptiste-colbert-recommended-to-king-louis-xiv>Why was Jean Baptiste Colbert recommended to King Louis XIV?</h2>
<p>Colbert was recommended to King Louis XIV by Mazarin. While Cardinal Mazarin was in exile, Louis’ trust in Colbert grew. In 1652 Colbert was asked to manage the affairs of the Cardinal while he was away.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jean-baptiste-colbert-gain-from-fouquets-fall>What did Jean Baptiste Colbert gain from Fouquet’s fall?</h2>
<p>Fouquet’s fall simultaneously secured Colbert’s own advancement. With the abolition of the office of superintendent and of many other offices dependent upon it, the supreme control of the finances became vested in a royal council.</p>
