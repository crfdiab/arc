<p>Clean surfaces that have touched floodwater with soap and warm, clean water; rinse; then sanitize using a solution of 1 cup bleach and 5 gallons water. Sanitize clothing, tools, and equipment with soap and water after coming into contact with contaminated floodwater or chemicals.</p>
<h2 id=what-towns-received-the-most-rain-from-hurricane-harvey>What towns received the most rain from Hurricane Harvey?</h2>
<p>The highest 4-day official rainfall amount from Harvey as of 10 am CDT Tuesday has been 49.32” at Marys Creek, according to NOAA/NWS/WPC. This breaks the previous all-time record for continental U.S. rainfall from a tropical cyclone or its remnants: 48.00” in the Texas hill country from Tropical Storm Amelia of 1978.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-hurricane-floyd-make-landfall-in-north-carolina>Where did Hurricane Floyd make landfall in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Radar imagery of Hurricane Floyd making landfall in North Carolina. Over a 24-hour period from September 12–13, Hurricane Floyd rapidly intensified, aided by warm waters east of The Bahamas. During that time, the maximum sustained winds increased from 110 to 155 mph (177 to 249 km/h), making Floyd a strong Category 4 hurricane.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-hurricane-floyd-affect-the-eastern-caribbean>How did Hurricane Floyd affect the Eastern Caribbean?</h2>
<p>On September 11, Hurricane Floyd moved through the upper-level trough, which, in conjunction with an anticyclone over the eastern Caribbean, disrupted the outflow and caused the winds to weaken briefly. The hurricane re-intensified on September 12 as its track shifted more to the west, steered by a ridge to the north.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-death-toll-from-hurricane-floyd>What was the death toll from Hurricane Floyd?</h2>
<p>Widespread rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 inches led to catastrophic and unprecedented flooding across sections of eastern North and South Carolina northward across the Mid-Atlantic states. Floyd’s death toll reached 36 in North Carolina and 57 across the United States as a whole, with total damage estimates near $6.5 billion.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-highest-wind-speed-of-hurricane-floyd>What was the highest wind speed of Hurricane Floyd?</h2>
<p>Frying Pan Tower, located offshore from Cape Fear, reported a peak wind gust of 112 mph. The highest wind gust at the Wilmington International Airport was 86 mph, precisely the same speed measured during Hurricane Fran three years earlier.</p>
