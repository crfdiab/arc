<h2 id=where-are-the-roma-originally-from>Where are the Roma originally from?</h2>
<p>northern India<br>
Where do Roma come from? Historians think the Roma’s ancestors first arrived in Europe from northern India, through what is now Iran, Armenia and Turkey. They gradually spread their way across the whole of Europe from the 9th century onwards.</p>
<h2 id=is-roma-a-hindu>Is Roma a Hindu?</h2>
<p>Some believe the Roma are their descendants. An old German theory said, the Roma are the descendants of the Chingari tribe (Tschingaren), a Hindu folk, that belonged to the Chandala (Tschandala), once lived in north-west India, and moved to Europe through Egypt, and from there to Europe over Asia Minor.</p>
<h2 id=are-roma-and-romanian-the-same>Are Roma and Romanian the same?</h2>
<p>While Romani are and have always been travellers, Romanians have always lived in the land of Dacia – somewhere between Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Romanians speak the Romanian language, the Roma community speaks the Romani language as well as the language of their country of residence – in this case Romanian.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-roma-mean>What does Roma mean?</h2>
<p>Romany<br>
a member of a people with dark skin and hair who speak Romany and who traditionally live by seasonal work and fortunetelling; they are believed to have originated in northern India but now are living on all continents (but mostly in Europe, North Africa, and North America)</p>
<h2 id=what-language-do-roma-speak>What language do Roma speak?</h2>
<p>Romani<br>
Romani, the common language of the Roma, the Sinti, the Kale and other European popula- tion groups summarised by the pejorative denomination gypsies, belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European language family and is the only New-Indo-Aryan language spo- ken exclusively outside of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-male-gypsy-called>What is a male Gypsy called?</h2>
<p>The top answer for Male gypsy is ‘ROM’.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-say-hello-in-roma>How do you say hello in Roma?</h2>
<p>Salve: A way to say ‘Hello’</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-origin-of-the-roma-come-from>Where did the origin of the Roma come from?</h2>
<p>The Roma originated in India. Linguistic analysis suggests that the Roma are originally a Hindi people from northern India. Genetic evidence also suggests that Romani people may have originated in northern India. A 2012 study, published in the journal Cell Biology, analyzed genomic data from 13 Romani communities across Europe.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-language-do-the-roma-speak>What kind of language do the Roma speak?</h2>
<p>Roma, singular Rom, also called Romany, or Gypsies (considered pejorative), an ethnic group of traditionally itinerant people who originated in northern India but live in modern times worldwide, principally in Europe. Most Roma speak some form of Romany, a language closely related to the modern Indo-European languages…</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-roma-people-and-what-do-they-do>Who are the Roma people and what do they do?</h2>
<p>Written By: Roma, singular Rom, also called Romany, or Gypsies (considered pejorative), an ethnic group of traditionally itinerant people who originated in northern India but live in modern times worldwide, principally in Europe.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-correct-spelling-roma-or-rommany>Which is the correct spelling Roma or Rommany?</h2>
<p>Romani was initially spelled Rommany, then Romany, while today the Romani spelling is the most popular spelling. Occasionally, the double r spelling (e.g., Rroma, Rromani) mentioned above is also encountered in English texts. The term Roma is increasingly encountered, as a generic term for the Romani people.</p>
