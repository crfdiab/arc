<h2 id=why-did-the-founding-fathers-believe-a-new-constitution-was-needed>Why did the Founding Fathers believe a new Constitution was needed?</h2>
<p>The Founding Fathers thought that it was necessary to have a constitution because they believed in the idea of limited government. Such a government would be able to tyrannize its people. With a constitution, by contrast, the powers of the government would be specified, as would the limits of those powers.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-they-think-the-constitution-was-necessary>Why did they think the Constitution was necessary?</h2>
<p>The men who wrote the Constitution of the United States believed that the US needed a new plan of government because they believed that the old plan gave too much power to the states and not enough to the national government. The states had too much power and were making laws that hurt the country as a whole.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-founding-fathers-feel-about-the-constitution>How did the founding fathers feel about the Constitution?</h2>
<p>One of the U.S. Founding Fathers, Patrick Henry, was initially opposed to the very idea of the Constitution! He wanted to keep the Articles of Confederation, the predecessor to the Constitution. However, when an agreement was made to add a “bill of rights” to the Constitution, Henry fought hard for its ratification.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-founding-fathers-want-for-the-future-of-america>What did the founding fathers want for the future of America?</h2>
<p>With the Revolutionary War behind them, they looked to the future. They agreed that they wanted liberty, but they did not all agree on the best course of action for the country, the appropriate role of government, or the optimal governmental structure that would balance liberty with order.</p>
<h2 id=why-didnt-the-original-constitution-contain-rights-for-the-people-what-did-it-contain>Why didn’t the original Constitution contain rights for the people what did it contain?</h2>
<p>Federalists argued that the Constitution did not need a bill of rights, because the people and the states kept any powers not given to the federal government. Anti-Federalists held that a bill of rights was necessary to safeguard individual liberty.</p>
<h2 id=what-led-to-the-us-constitution>What led to the US Constitution?</h2>
<p>Why was the Constitution written? In 1787, Congress authorized delegates to gather in Philadelphia and recommend changes to the existing charter of government for the 13 states, the Articles of Confederation, which many Americans believed had created a weak, ineffective central government.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-delegates-want-to-keep-their-discussions-secret>Why did the delegates want to keep their discussions secret?</h2>
<p>*Why did delegates to the Constitutional Convention keep their debates secret? They wanted to be able to freely speak their minds. *How was the national government organized under the Virginia Plan? It called for three branches of government and representation based on state population.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-founding-fathers-want-to-create-a-constitution>Why did the Founding Fathers want to create a constitution?</h2>
<p>The founding fathers wanted to create a constitution because many believed that the national government had to be stronger than what it had been with the use of the Articles of Confederation.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-legacy-of-the-founding-fathers>What was the legacy of the founding fathers?</h2>
<p>In the end, the legacy of the Founding Fathers is the promise of liberty and justice, not only for Americans, but for any people willing to invest in democratic self-government. Before becoming the the United States’ first president, George Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention, which established the nation’s Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-founding-fathers-of-the-united-states>Who are the Founding Fathers of the United States?</h2>
<p>The key Founding Fathers, John Adams, James Monroe, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and George Washington believed it was necessary to write the constitution in order to strengthen and further define the government as put forth in the Articles of Confederation.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-founding-fathers-create-the-second-amendment>Why did the founding fathers create the Second Amendment?</h2>
<p>Answer by Richard Potter, on Quora. The Second Amendment was created so that the states could form militias or armies to destroy insurrections or slave rebellions because the federal government had no standing military for a long time. The Founding Fathers were frightened by a standing army, because they feared coups.</p>
