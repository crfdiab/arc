<h2 id=is-giant-causeway-worth-visiting>Is Giant Causeway worth visiting?</h2>
<p>Well, the Giant’s Causeway is absolutely spectacular and I personally would consider it one the world’s natural wonders. Saying that I am not sure how practical is to spend at least one day only to see it (and most part of this day you’d be driving), especially if this is your first time to Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=is-giants-causeway-closer-to-dublin-or-belfast>Is Giant’s Causeway closer to Dublin or Belfast?</h2>
<p>It is a longer route (around 2.5 hours) but you will enjoy it. Driving straight from Belfast to the Giant’s Causeway is around 1.5 hours. Tourists from Dublin would need to plan ahead if they want to do the entire Coastal Route as it is quite time-consuming.</p>

<p>The north Antrim coastline in renowned for its scenic beauty and the Giant’s Causeway is its unique jewel in the crown, known to the Irish as the 8th Wonder of the World.

<h2 id=how-do-i-avoid-paying-at-giants-causeway>How do I avoid paying at Giants Causeway?</h2>
<p>To skip the fees simply park away from the visitors centre. The lot at Giant’s Causeway & Bushmills Railway is just a few pounds and a short walk away. You may also find a local farmer who will let you park and walk from his land for a small fee. So why would you pay to visit if the site itself is free?</p>
<h2 id=can-you-walk-on-giants-causeway>Can you walk on Giants Causeway?</h2>
<p>To walk onsite to the Giant’s Causeway Visitor Centre and Causeway Hotel, you can park in the nearby seaside village of Portballintrae and walk part of the Causeway Coast Way, (called the Yellow Trail on our maps) and then the Green Trail which links to the Red Trail.</p>

<p>It does, however, attract some 300,000 tourists annually. Deriving its name from local folklore, it is fabled to be the work of giants, particularly of Finn MacCumhaill (MacCool), who built it as part of a causeway to the Scottish island of Staffa (which has similar rock formations) for motives of either love or war.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-day-trip-from-dublin-to-giants-causeway>Is there a day trip from Dublin to giant’s causeway?</h2>
<p>Going to Giant’s Causeway was a last minute decision, made the day before, and shortly after arriving from a day-long exploration of the city of Dublin. Northern Ireland is a short drive away and a good fit for a day trip all the way up north to the Giant’s Causeway, including passing through Belfast on the way. In total around 600 km round trip.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-the-irish-giant-who-built-the-giants-causeway>Who was the Irish giant who built the giant’s causeway?</h2>
<p>The Giant’s Causeway is the highlight of this trip for most! Built by the Irish giant Fionn and his Scottish rival Angus, it is a real masterpiece formed of perfectly shaped hexagonal columns. Your tour guide shall tell you more about the Causeway, and the legends of the area.</p>
