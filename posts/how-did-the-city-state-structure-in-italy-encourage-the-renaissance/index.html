<h2 id=how-did-the-city-state-structure-in-italy-encourage-the-renaissance>How did the city state structure in Italy encourage the Renaissance?</h2>
<p>How did the city state structure encourage the Renaissance? Their connections to trade brought wealth that encouraged new ideas. Wealthy rulers of city states were patrons of artists, cities had greater concentration of artists, artisans and scholars, trade was well establish in the city states.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-city-states-develop-in-italy>Why did city-states develop in Italy?</h2>
<p>The Italian city-states formed as these urban cities vied for independence from the Holy Roman Emperor and the Church. After a series of trade and political rivalries, five major cities emerged: Milan, Venice, Florence, Naples, and the Papal States.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-italian-city-states-grow-and-become-wealthy-at-the-beginning-of-the-renaissance>Why did Italian city states grow and become wealthy at the beginning of the Renaissance?</h2>
<p>Italy grew wealthy because of trade at the Italian peninsula. Italians traded with China and India to get silk and spices and they used the items to sell to the western Europe, and they used the items for other reasons such as making things that was useful.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-italian-states-helped-fuel-the-renaissance>How did the Italian States helped fuel the Renaissance?</h2>
<p>These ancient examples inspired the Italians in their own art. Another reason the Renaissance was born was because Italian cities were very rich. People could pay painters, sculptors, architects, and other artists to make new works. The powerful states of Italy also encouraged the Renaissance.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-italy-the-birth-place-of-the-renaissance>Why was Italy the birth place of the Renaissance?</h2>
<p>Another reason for Italy becoming the birth place of an artistic renaissance lay in the fact that it had a far greater sense of rapport with the classical past than any other territory in Western Europe. The Italian aristocratic commitment to an educational curriculum speared success in urban politics.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-venice-have-to-do-with-the-renaissance>What did Venice have to do with the Renaissance?</h2>
<p>It imported products such as spices and silk. However, when the Ottoman Empire conquered Constantinople, Venice’s trade empire began to shrink. Venice controlled the seas around the east coast of Italy and was famous for its artistic glassware. The pope ruled both the Catholic Church and the city-state of Rome.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-florence-an-important-city-in-the-renaissance>Why was Florence an important city in the Renaissance?</h2>
<p>The wealth of the Italian city-state played an important role in the Renaissance. This wealth allowed prominent families to support artists, scientists, and philosophers spurring on new ideas and artistic movements. Florence is where the Renaissance first began.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-renaissance-spread-to-other-countries>How did the Renaissance spread to other countries?</h2>
<p>Although the Renaissance is most notably connected with the Italian city-states, as it was there that this movement originated, over time the Renaissance would spread to other parts of Europe as well. If playback doesn’t begin shortly, try restarting your device.</p>
