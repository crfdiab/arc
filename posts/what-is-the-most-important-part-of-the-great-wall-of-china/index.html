<p>1. Mutianyu – the most magnificent fully-restored Great Wall section. The Mutianyu section is the most popular among foreign travelers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-manchus-breach-the-great-wall>How did the Manchus breach the Great Wall?</h2>
<p>Breach of Juyongguan Also in 1211, after Genghis Khan captured Huailai in Hebei and Yanqing in Beijing, he chased the Jin army all the way to the Juyongguan Great Wall. Suddenly, numerous Mongol soldiers appeared from nearby mountains and surrounded the Jin soldiers, defeated them and captured Juyongguan Pass.</p>
<h2 id=what-dynasty-built-the-great-wall-of-china>What dynasty built the Great Wall of China?</h2>
<p>the Ming dynasty<br>
The total length of all sections of the Great Wall of China ever built adds up to about 21,196 kilometers (13,171 miles), including overlapping sections that were rebuilt. The wall constructed during the Ming dynasty, the most well-preserved section, is about 8,850 kilometers (5,499 miles) long.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-the-great-wall-of-china-against-whom-did-the-chinese-need-to-protect-themselves>What is the importance of the Great Wall of China Against whom did the Chinese need to protect themselves?</h2>
<p>The Great Wall of China was built as a military defensive line to defend the invasions from some northern nomadic nations. Apart from the function of defense, the wall also boosted the economy, as well as promoted the culture exchange and national integration of different nations at its two sides.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-importance-of-great-wall-of-china>What is importance of Great Wall of China?</h2>
<p>Emperor Qin Shihuang’s contribution to the design of the Wall is considered to be of great importance as it ensured peace for the people in the northern part of China against the Huns and established a pattern of defense for future generations. The Great Wall of the Qin Dynasty was built at the expense of many lives.</p>
<h2 id=who-helped-build-the-great-wall-of-china>Who helped build the Great Wall of China?</h2>
<p>Qin Shi Huang<br>
Around 220 B.C.E., Qin Shi Huang, also called the First Emperor, united China. He masterminded the process of uniting the existing walls into one. At that time, rammed earth and wood made up most of the wall.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-the-great-wall-of-china-today>What is the purpose of the Great Wall of China today?</h2>
<p>The Great Wall protected China’s economic development and cultural progress, safeguarding trading routes such as the Silk Road, and securing the transmission of information and transportation in northern China.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-manchus-adapt-to-chinese-culture>How did the Manchus adapt to Chinese culture?</h2>
<p>But even as they adapted themselves to the greater Chinese culture, the Manchus nonetheless maintained their own identity and universalized their approach, making them in essence no different from the many elites that had established previous “Chinese” dynasties.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-chinese-build-the-great-wall-of-china>Why did the Chinese build the Great Wall of China?</h2>
<p>The only place for possible endless expansion is toward north. The wall, along with the fact that Chinese by nature farmers and unintersted in agrid and cold weather, in effect put a border on what Chinese considered as its “own” territory.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-manchus-do-before-the-qing-conquest>What did the Manchus do before the Qing conquest?</h2>
<p>Manchus were living in cities with walls surrounded by villages and adopting Han-style agriculture well before the Qing conquest of the Ming, and there was an established tradition of Han-Manchu mixing before 1644. The Han Chinese soldiers on the Liaodong frontier often mixed with non-Han tribesmen and were largely acculturated to their ways.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-great-wall-of-china>How long is the Great Wall of China?</h2>
<p>Depending on how the wall is measured, it stretches somewhere between 4,000 and 5,500 kilometers (2,500 and 3,400 miles). In the 17th century, the Manchu emperors extended Chinese rule into Inner Mongolia, making the wall less important as a defense.</p>
