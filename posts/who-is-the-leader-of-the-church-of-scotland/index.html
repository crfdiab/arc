<h2 id=who-is-the-leader-of-the-church-of-scotland>Who is the leader of the Church of Scotland?</h2>
<p>Jesus Christ<br>
The Church of Scotland is a Presbyterian church and recognises only Jesus Christ as ‘King and Head of the Church’. The Queen therefore does not hold the title ‘Supreme Governor’ of the Church of Scotland; when attending Church services in Scotland Her Majesty does so as an ordinary member.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-the-church-of-scotland-and-the-free-church>What is the difference between the Church of Scotland and the Free church?</h2>
<p>The United Free Church of Scotland Today’s United Free Church is a continuation of the former denomination when the majority of its members united with the Church of Scotland in 1929.

<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-the-moderator-of-the-church-of-scotland>What is the role of the Moderator of the Church of Scotland?</h2>
<p>The Moderator presides over the meeting of the court, much as a convener presides over the meeting of a church committee. The moderator is thus the chairperson, and is understood to be a member of the court acting primus inter pares.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-the-church-of-scotland-worth>How much is the Church of Scotland worth?</h2>

<h2 id=who-is-the-head-of-the-church-of-scotland>Who is the head of the Church of Scotland?</h2>
<p>The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland is the sovereign and highest court of the Church of Scotland, and is thus the Church’s governing body. It generally meets each year and is chaired by a Moderator elected at the start of the Assembly.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-general-assembly-of-the-church-of-scotland>When is the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland?</h2>
<p>The General Assembly 2019 was held from 18-24 May and had more than 700 commissioners. The Assembly notably debated the radical action plan, fossil fuel divestment, and the future of the National Youth Assembly. Convener speeches, Moderator’s worship, and supporting documents, are all available in the General Assembly 2019 section.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-lord-high-commissioner-of-the-church-of-scotland>Who is the Lord High Commissioner of the Church of Scotland?</h2>
<p>Prince William has been appointed as the Lord High Commissioner to the 2021 General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. His Royal Highness was appointed by Her Majesty The Queen as her personal representative at the annual event in Edinburgh which opens on Saturday 22 May and will be streamed online due to Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-moderator-of-the-church-of-scotland>Who is the moderator of the Church of Scotland?</h2>
<p>This is set out in the Acts Declaratory and the Church of Scotland Act 1921 . The Assembly elects a Moderator to preside (see also the list of previous Moderators ). The Queen is personally represented by a Lord High Commissioner, who has no vote.</p>

<p>A Church of Scotland congregation is led by its minister and elders. Both of these terms are also used in other Christian denominations: see Minister (Christianity) and Elder (Christianity). This article discusses the specific understanding of their roles and functions in the Scottish Church.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-church-of-scotland-looking-for-new-ministers>Is the Church of Scotland looking for new ministers?</h2>
<p>The Church of Scotland is actively looking for the next generation of ministers. We seek women and men of all… Read more Priority Area congregations are responding to the Church’s call to give priority to the poorest communities….</p>

<h2 id=how-is-the-church-of-scotland-divided-into-parishes>How is the Church of Scotland divided into parishes?</h2>
<p>The Church of Scotland, the national churchof Scotland, divides the country into Presbyteries, which in turn are subdivided into Parishes, each served by a parish church, usually with its own minister. Unions and readjustments may however result in a parish having more than one building, or several parishes sharing a minister.</p>
