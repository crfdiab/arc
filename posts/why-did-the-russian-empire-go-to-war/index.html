<h2 id=why-did-the-russian-empire-go-to-war>Why did the Russian Empire go to war?</h2>
<p>Tsar Nicholas II mobilized Russian forces on 30 July 1914 to threaten Austria-Hungary if it invaded Serbia. Germany felt threatened by Russia, responding with its own mobilization and a declaration of war on 1 August 1914.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-russian-empire-so-successful>Why was the Russian Empire so successful?</h2>
<p>Because of its crucial role in the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, the Russian Empire was the dominant actor on continental Europe and rolled back political reform and revolutions. The Russian Empire had waged a series of successful wars against the Ottoman Empire in 1828 and 1829 and declared war again in 1853.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-wars-did-russia-have>How many wars did Russia have?</h2>
<p>On analysis, the history of Russia is a history of constant war. Russian philosopher Ivan Ilyin wrote: “Soloviev has counted 200 wars and invasions from 1240 until 1462 (period of 222 years).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-russian-empire-have-so-many-casualties>Why did the Russian Empire have so many casualties?</h2>
<p>Violent protests and raids on the institutions of the Russian colonizers and the colonial administration set up in the 1860s ensued. In response, army attacks and retaliation on the part of the colonizers caused more than 1,000 deaths among the native population.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-russian-empire-still-exist>Does the Russian Empire still exist?</h2>
<p>In early 2017, it was reported that Bakov was interested in acquiring three Pacific islands belonging to Kiribati in order to establish a “revived Romanov Empire”….Romanov Empire (micronation)</p>
<table><tr><th>Romanov Empire Романовская Империя (Russian)</th></tr><tr><td>• Declared</td><td>2 September 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Membership</td><td>~5,000b</td></tr><tr><td>Currency</td><td>Bitcoin</td></tr><tr><td>Time zone</td><td>GMT</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-did-the-civil-war-affect-the-russian-empire>How did the Civil War affect the Russian Empire?</h2>
<p>The number of soldiers missing in action and civilian losses suffered distinguish Russia from the other warring nations. This was a result of the spatial and temporal nature of the occupation of the western fringes of the empire. Finally, the 1918 civil war intensified the terrible human cost of the conflict.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-russian-empire-so-difficult-to-govern>Why was the Russian Empire so difficult to govern?</h2>
<p>And it is for that very reason that governing the Russian empire was such an onerous and complex task. To begin with, tsarist Russia in the early 20th century occupied a vast territory, approximately one sixth of the world’s total land mass. Major areas, especially west of the Ural mountains, were uninhabited or sparsely populated.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-the-russian-empire>What was the population of the Russian Empire?</h2>
<p>With a population of 150 million people, the Russian Empire, seems to have suffered proportionally fewer losses during the war than France or Germany. However, the Russian army only mobilised some civilians of fighting age.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-the-uk-and-the-russian-empire>What was the relationship between the UK and the Russian Empire?</h2>
<p>Russian Empire sees UK as an okay friend. He fought with him in the Crimean war with France on UK’s side, which both Russian Empire and UK will never forget, but both saw each other as good friends siding in wars with each other like the Boxer Rebellion or WW1. She doesn’t forgive her for the Napoleonic wars and Crimean War but still allies.</p>
