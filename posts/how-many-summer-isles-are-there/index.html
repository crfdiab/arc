<h2 id=how-many-summer-isles-are-there>How many Summer Isles are there?</h2>
<p>The Summer Isles is a group of about 20 islands, rocks and skerries within the Wester Ross Marine Protected Area that sit off the Coigach peninsula.</p>
<h2 id=who-owns-tanera-mòr>Who owns Tanera Mòr?</h2>
<p>tycoon Ian Wace<br>
Tanera Mor was bought last year by English hedge fund tycoon Ian Wace for £1,695,000 – far less than the £2.5m asking price when it was originally put on the market in 2013.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-summer-isles-called-the-summer-isles>Why are the Summer Isles called the Summer Isles?</h2>
<p>Crofting History. The Summer Isles acquired that name because that was where the local crofters used to transport their sheep for the summer grazing. Tanera Mor, the largest of the Summer Isles, now has a tiny permanent population but in the 19th century supported over 100 inhabitants.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-summer-islands-in-scotland>Where are the Summer Islands in Scotland?</h2>
<p>The Isle of Tanera Mòr lies within the Summer Isles archipelago, just a mile off the Coigach Peninsula in the North-West Highlands of Scotland.</p>
<h2 id=does-anyone-live-on-the-summer-isles>Does anyone live on the Summer Isles?</h2>
<p>The 800-acre (323.7ha) Tanera Mòr is the largest and only inhabited island in the Summer Isles in Wester Ross. Current owners, the Wilder family, bought the island in 1996 and put it back on the market in 2013.</p>
<h2 id=is-summerisle-a-real-place>Is summerisle a real place?</h2>
<p>The story unfolds on the fictional Scottish island of Summerisle, but filming happened in several coastal locations around the production base in Newton Stewart, Scotland.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-summer-isles-in-game-of-thrones>Where are the Summer Isles in Game of Thrones?</h2>
<p>The Summer Islands (or Summer Isles) are an archipelago in the Summer Sea. Located southeast of Westeros and southwest of Volantis, the island of Naath lies to the east, between the Summer Islands and mainland Sothoryos.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-wicker-man-real>Is The Wicker Man real?</h2>
<p>The movie was an oddball horror called The Wicker Man. It was about a puritanical policeman (Edward Woodward) who travels to a remote (and entirely fictional) Scottish island in the Hebrides to investigate the case of a missing child. Instead he discovers a town of merry pagans, led by Lee’s Lord Summerisle.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-dorne-join-the-seven-kingdoms>How did Dorne join the Seven Kingdoms?</h2>
<p>It joined the Seven Kingdoms through peaceful marriage alliance nearly two centuries later, only one century before Robert’s Rebellion. As a result of joining through marriage and not conquest, Dorne was allowed to keep many of its local customs and laws, such as equal inheritance laws for male and female heirs.</p>
<h2 id=what-religion-is-the-wicker-man>What religion is The Wicker Man?</h2>
<p>Christian<br>
Howie, a devout Christian, is appalled to find that the inhabitants of the island have abandoned Christianity and now practice a form of Celtic paganism. Paul Giovanni composed the film score. The Wicker Man is well-regarded by critics.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-druids-burn-people>Did the Druids burn people?</h2>
<p>The Druids were said to believe that the soul was immortal and passed at death from one person into another. Huge wickerwork images were filled with living men and then burned; although the Druids preferred to sacrifice criminals, they would choose innocent victims if necessary.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-island-in-the-summer-isles>Which is the largest island in the Summer Isles?</h2>
<p>The Summer Isles ( Scottish Gaelic: Na h-Eileanan Samhraidh, pronounced [nə ˈhelanən ˈs̪ãũɾɪ] ( listen)) are an archipelago lying in the mouth of Loch Broom, in the Highland region of Scotland . Tanera Mòr is the largest island, although it only has a couple of inhabitants.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-summer-isles-located-in-scotland>Where are the Summer Isles located in Scotland?</h2>
<p>/ 58.030338; -5.453436 / 58.030338; -5.453436 The Summer Isles ( Scottish Gaelic: Na h-Eileanan Samhraidh, pronounced [nə ˈhelanən ˈs̪ãũɾɪ] ( listen)) are an archipelago lying in the mouth of Loch Broom, in the Highland region of Scotland . Tanera Mòr is the largest island, although it only has a couple of inhabitants.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-roads-to-the-summer-isles>Are there any roads to the Summer Isles?</h2>
<p>The island has no roads, and the only recognisable path goes around the Anchorage, the sheltered bay on the east side of the island. Boats sail to the island from Achiltibuie and Ullapool. The islands are part of the Assynt – Coigach National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-settlements-on-the-summer-isles>Where are the settlements on the Summer Isles?</h2>
<p>Walano contains the settlements of Lotus Port, Last Lament, and Tall Trees Town. The cultural or religious heart of the islands seems to be Tall Trees Town, where priestesses carve histories and laws into the Talking Trees.</p>
