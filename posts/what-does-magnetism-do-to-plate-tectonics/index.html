<h2 id=what-does-magnetism-do-to-plate-tectonics>What does magnetism do to plate tectonics?</h2>
<p>One of the key pieces of evidence supporting plate tectonic theory was the discovery that rocks on the seafloor record ancient reversals of the Earth’s magnetic field: as rocks are formed where plates are moving away from one another, they record the current direction of the Earth’s magnetic field, which flip-flops …</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-plate-tectonics-move>What makes the plate tectonics move?</h2>
<p>The heat from radioactive processes within the planet’s interior causes the plates to move, sometimes toward and sometimes away from each other. This movement is called plate motion, or tectonic shift.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-ways-that-the-tectonics-plates-are-moving>What are the 3 ways that the tectonics plates are moving?</h2>
<p>The movement of the plates creates three types of tectonic boundaries: convergent, where plates move into one another; divergent, where plates move apart; and transform, where plates move sideways in relation to each other. They move at a rate of one to two inches (three to five centimeters) per year.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-earths-magnetic-field-help-drive-plate-motion>Does the Earth’s magnetic field help drive plate motion?</h2>
<p>The Earth’s magnetic field helps to drive plate motion. Continents are generally older than ocean basins. The volcanoes that make up volcanic arcs always sit directly on top of the plate boundary of a subduction zone.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-plate-motion-were-reversed>What would happen if plate motion were reversed?</h2>
<p>But without plate tectonics, Earth will simply stop making new ones. The mountains we have now would erode over a few million years, turning into low, rolling hills. Our planet would eventually flatten out, with more land ending up underwater. But if volcanoes are out, then so is Earth’s magnetic field.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-seafloor-spreading-plate-tectonics-evidence>How is seafloor spreading plate tectonics evidence?</h2>
<p>Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-earths-plates-pull-away-from-each-other>What happens when the Earth’s plates pull away from each other?</h2>
<p>A divergent boundary occurs when two tectonic plates move away from each other. Magma rises into and through the other plate, solidifying into granite, the rock that makes up the continents. Thus, at convergent boundaries, continental crust is created and oceanic crust is destroyed.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-plates-are-pushed-towards-each-other>What happens when plates are pushed towards each other?</h2>
<p>This is one of the most common causes of earthquakes. At convergent boundaries, plates move toward each other. They can push together and cause mountain ranges to form. When this happens, new plate material forms.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-tectonic-plates-of-the-earth-moving>How are the tectonic plates of the earth moving?</h2>
<p>The Earth’s tectonic plates are constantly moving like giant ‘rafts’ on top of the semi-molten mantle below. However, this movement is slow and rates vary from less than 2.5cm /yr to over 15cm/yr. One explanation for the movement of the Earth’s crustal plates is believed to be convection currents which occur in the semi-molten mantle.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-magnetism-have-to-do-with-plate-tectonics>What does magnetism have to do with plate tectonics?</h2>
<p>Magnetism is part of the evidence for plate tectonic theory. Earth spins on its axis, making a full rotation roughly every 24 hours. The interaction of the spin and the magnetic minerals inside the Earth creates Earth’s magnetic field, stretching between the north and south magnetic poles.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-movement-of-tectonic-plates-a-controversy>Is the movement of tectonic plates a controversy?</h2>
<p>Controversy Surrounding Tectonic Plate Movement. From the convection cells in the mantle and the theory of plate tectonics, the operation of the plates movement appears to lack more details to explain it fully. Earth’s scientists are still debating amongst themselves on the mechanism by which the Earth’s tectonic plates move.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-slab-pull-affect-the-movement-of-tectonic-plates>How does slab pull affect the movement of tectonic plates?</h2>
<p>Slab pull is the most relevant force that affects the movement of tectonic plates. Convection refers to specific cells within the Earth’s mantle that create heat. The heat makes the solid rocks move upwards while the colder rocks move downwards. Tectonic plates are large pieces of the Earth’s crust and its topmost mantle.</p>
