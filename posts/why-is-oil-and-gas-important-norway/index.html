<h2 id=why-is-oil-and-gas-important-norway>Why is oil and gas important Norway?</h2>
<p>Norway supplies between 20 and 25 per cent of the EU gas demand. Nearly all oil and gas produced on the Norwegian shelf is exported, and combined, oil and gas equals about half of the total value of Norwegian exports of goods. This makes oil and gas the most important export commodities in the Norwegian economy.</p>
<h2 id=does-norway-benefit-from-oil-and-gas-reserves>Does Norway benefit from oil and gas reserves?</h2>
<p>The oil and gas sector is Norway’s largest measured in terms of value added, government revenues, investments and export value. Since production started on the Norwegian continental shelf in the early 1970s, petroleum activities have contributed to around NOK 16 000 billion in current NOK to Norway’s GDP.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-norway-use-a-lot-of-energy>Why does Norway use a lot of energy?</h2>
<p>Within the energy sector, new landfills within the petroleum sector have contributed to the energy consumption more than doubled since the 1970s. Service industries are a sector of strong growth over the last 30 years and this has led to a significant increase in energy consumption.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-norway-main-source-of-energy>What is Norway main source of energy?</h2>
<p>Hydropower<br>
Hydropower is the source of most of the production. Hydropower has been the basis for Norwegian industry and the development of a welfare society since we started utilizing the energy in rivers and waterfalls to produce energy in the late 1800s.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-norways-energy-comes-from-water>What percentage of Norway’s energy comes from water?</h2>
<p>Norway is a heavy producer of renewable energy because of hydropower. Over 99% of the electricity production in mainland Norway is from 31 GW hydropower plants (86 TWh reservoir capacity, storing water from summer to winter).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-norway-important-to-the-oil-and-gas-industry>Why is Norway important to the oil and gas industry?</h2>
<p>Norway’s production is expected to increase over the next few years, but there are concerns about long-term resource growth. Credit: Henning Flusund. With its coastline on the North Sea, Norway is an important country for the oil and gas industry.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-onshore-oil-and-gas-fields-in-norway>Are there any onshore oil and gas fields in Norway?</h2>
<p>Oil and gas production in Norway is only offshore. While there are significant onshore processing facilities, there is no onshore production. The average estimated recovery factor for oil on the NCS is now close to 50% after steady increments during the last decade.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-oil-does-norway-produce-per-day>How much oil does Norway produce per day?</h2>
<p>The country is currently the 15th-largest oil producer in the world, with a production rate of 1,647,975 billion barrels per day. New developments and exploration efforts in the area are expected to increase production, but will that be enough to keep Norway’s offshore industry afloat?</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-oil-and-gas-tax-code-in-norway>What is the oil and gas tax code in Norway?</h2>
<p>1.0 Summary The Norwegian Oil and Gas Taxation Code includes direct and indirect taxation. Direct taxation plays the most important role for companies investing in upstream activities on the Norwegian continental shelf.</p>
