<h2 id=who-won-the-greek-and-persian-war>Who won the Greek and Persian war?</h2>
<p>Though the outcome of battles seemed to tip in Persia’s favor (such as the famed battle at Thermopylae where a limited number of Spartans managed to wage an impressive stand against the Persians), the Greeks won the war. There are two factors that helped the Greeks defeat the Persian Empire.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-persians-not-conquer-greece>Why did the Persians not conquer Greece?</h2>
<p>The Persians had an immense number of mouths to feed and an immensely long supply line. They could keep a giant army in Greece for only a few months, and once they reduced it to something approximating what the Greeks could field, the Greeks had all the advantages.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-greeks-defeat-the-persian-empire>When did the Greeks defeat the Persian Empire?</h2>
<p>With the Persian defeat came a thriving period of time where the Greek city-states began to really flourish. The Greco-Persian Wars, which took place from 492 BC to 449 BC, happened at a time when the Persian Empire was at its peak. Yet, the Greeks were the ultimate victors by the war’s end.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-persians-win-the-persian-war>Why did the Persians win the Persian War?</h2>
<p>Though the Persians ultimately won this conflict, it started to create a sense of unity amongst the Greek city-states because Athens sent a small fleet in support of Ionians. This sense of unity is part of what made Greek city-states ultimately successful.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-battle-of-marathon-end-persian-domination>How did the Battle of Marathon end Persian domination?</h2>
<p>The Greek cities in Asia Minor eventually decided to throw off the Persian yoke. Through those revolts, the assistance of the Athenians and the ensuing Battle of Marathon, the wheels had been set in motion to end Persian domination. How did this sequence of events come to pass?</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-greco-persian-war-take-place>When did the Greco Persian War take place?</h2>
<p>The Greco-Persian Wars, which took place from 492 BC to 449 BC, happened at a time when the Persian Empire was at its peak. Yet, the Greeks were the ultimate victors by the war’s end. How did they do it? Before the war began, the Persians began moving their way towards Greece.</p>
