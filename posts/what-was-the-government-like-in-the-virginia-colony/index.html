<h2 id=what-was-the-government-like-in-the-virginia-colony>What was the government like in the Virginia Colony?</h2>
<p>The first colonial legislature was the Virginia House of Burgesses, established in 1619. The colonies along the eastern coast of North America were formed under different types of charter, but most developed representative democratic governments to rule their territories.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-virginia-colonies-grow>What did the Virginia colonies grow?</h2>
<p>Virginia farmers raised vegetables like corn, beans, peas, carrots, and cabbage to eat. Corn was an important crop because it provided food for humans, eaten fresh or ground into corn meal flour, and food for farm animals; and the husks could be used for fodder, to make mats, or to stuff into mattresses.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-written-government-in-the-new-world>What was the first written government in the New World?</h2>
<p>The Mayflower Compact, signed by 41 English colonists on the ship Mayflower on November 11, 1620, was the first written framework of government established in what is now the United States.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-colony-of-virginia-get-started>How did the colony of Virginia get started?</h2>
<p>Colonization in Virginia started in 1606 as a speculative investment by a joint stock company. The costs to transport colonists across the Atlantic Ocean, and to build what became Jamestown, was financed by individual investors who “adventured” their capital in hopes of making a profit.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-government-in-jamestown-change-in-1619>How did the government in Jamestown change in 1619?</h2>
<p>The first charter granted by King James I of England to the Virginia Company established a seven-man council in Virginia to carry out Company directives.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-governor-of-the-virginia-colony>Who was the Governor of the Virginia Colony?</h2>
<p>Over the next five years, Sir Thomas Gates and then Sir Thomas Dale governed the colony with iron fists via the “Lawes Devine, Morall, and Martiall.” The harsh regimes of the Virginia governors were not especially attractive to potential colonists.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-population-of-virginia-change-in-the-1700s>Why did the population of Virginia change in the 1700s?</h2>
<p>In the 1700s, the work force in Virginia shifted from indentured servants to slave laborers. This shift was due to a decline in immigrants from Great Britain & Europe and the increased demand for labor in the tobacco farming industry. By 1710, about 25% of the population were slaves from West Africa. This percent increased each year. Agriculture</p>
