<h2 id=what-is-initiative-referendum-and-recall>What is Initiative referendum and recall?</h2>
<p>In 1911, California voters approved the constitutional processes of initiative, referendum, and recall. Through these processes, voters can adopt a change in law (an initiative), disapprove a law passed by the Legislature (a referendum), or remove an elected official from office (a recall).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-ballot-initiative-system>What is the ballot initiative system?</h2>
<p>The ballot initiative process gives California citizens a way to propose laws and constitutional amendments without the support of the Governor or the Legislature.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-constitution-say-about-citizen-voting>What did the Constitution say about citizen voting?</h2>
<p>The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-referendums>What is the meaning of referendums?</h2>
<p>A referendum (plural: referendums or less commonly referenda) is a direct vote by the electorate on a particular proposal or issue. This is in contrast to an issue being voted on by a representative. It can have nationwide or local forms. This may result in the adoption of a new policy or specific law.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-an-amendment-is-approved-by-the-general-assembly>What happens if an amendment is approved by the General Assembly?</h2>
<p>Text that appears in bold print are the changes to the words of the Constitution that are proposed by the General Assembly. If the amendment is approved, the words underlined would be added to the Constitution and the words in [brackets] would be deleted.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-the-governor-vetoes-a-bill>What happens if the Governor vetoes a bill?</h2>
<p>If the order, resolution or vote is approved by the Governor, it becomes law. If the Governor vetoes the resolution, it does not become law unless two-thirds of the House and Senate vote to override the veto.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-resolutions-need-to-be-presented-to-the-governor>When do resolutions need to be presented to the Governor?</h2>
<p>Currently, Article III, Section 9 establishes a general rule that all orders, resolutions or votes requiring approval by both the House of Representatives and Senate must be presented to the Governor for his approval or veto. Resolutions for the adjournment of the General Assembly are exempted from this process.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-the-pennsylvania-constitution-be-amended-by>What should the Pennsylvania Constitution be amended by?</h2>
<p>Shall the Pennsylvania Constitution be amended by adding a new section providing that equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of an individual’s race or ethnicity? What does this mean?</p>
