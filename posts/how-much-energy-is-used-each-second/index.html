<h2 id=how-much-energy-is-used-each-second>How much energy is used each second?</h2>
<p>The most common unit is the watt (W), defined as 1 joule (J) of energy per second. A 40 W light bulb, then, uses 40 J of electrical energy every second to stay lit. The average power output of the human body during moderate exercise is about 100 W. For most engines and power plants there are two different powers.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-people-use-energy>What percentage of people use energy?</h2>
<p>At a global level, the percentage of people with access to electricity has been steadily increasing over the last few decades. In 1990, around 71% of the world’s population had access; this has increased to 87% in 2016.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-energy-is-used-per-year>How much energy is used per year?</h2>
<p>In 2019, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,649 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of about 877 kWh per month.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-energy-is-used-globally>How much energy is used globally?</h2>
<p>The annual global energy consumption is estimated to 580 million terajoules. That’s 580 million trillion joules or about 13865 million tons of oil equivalents.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-10-uses-of-electricity>What are the 10 uses of electricity?</h2>
<p>Here are the 10 Household Items that Uses The Most Electricity In Your Home</p>
<ul>
<li>Heating.</li>
<li>Cooling.</li>
<li>Water Heater.</li>
<li>Washer and Dryer.</li>
<li>Lights.</li>
<li>Refrigerator.</li>
<li>Electric Oven.</li>
<li>Dishwasher.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=which-country-uses-the-most-electricity-2020>Which country uses the most electricity 2020?</h2>
<p>China<br>
China is the largest consumer of primary energy in the world, using some 145.46 exajoules in 2020. This is far more than was consumed by the United States, which ranks second.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-energy-does-a-person-use-in-a-year>How much energy does a person use in a year?</h2>
<p>In 2017, total energy use per person (“per capita consumption”) in the United States was 300 million British thermal units (Btu). 1,2 32% of this was from industrial use, 29% from transportation, 20% from residential use, and 18% from commercial use. 1 Per-person energy use in the United States decreased by 10.7% from 2007 to 2017. 3</p>
<h2 id=how-much-electricity-does-the-united-states-use>How much electricity does the United States use?</h2>
<p>Total U.S. electricity consumption in 2020 was about 3.8 trillion kWh and 13 times greater than electricity use in 1950. Total electricity consumption includes retail sales of electricity to consumers and direct use electricity.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-terawatts-of-power-does-the-world-use>How many terawatts of power does the world use?</h2>
<p>Currently, the world’s population consumes 15 terawatts of power from a combination of these energy sources [source: The Economist]. Just how much power is 15 terawatts? Let’s think of it in smaller and more familiar terms: watts. Many of the lightbulbs in our homes consume 100 watts of energy.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-up-21-of-home-energy-use>What makes up 21% of home energy use?</h2>
<p>The remaining share—21%—of home energy use was for devices such as televisions, cooking appliances, clothes washers, and clothes dryers, as well as a growing list of consumer electronics including computers, tablets, smartphones, video game consoles, and internet streaming devices. Bar chart with 6 data series.</p>
