<h2 id=what-strengths-did-the-north-have-in-the-civil-war>What strengths did the North have in the Civil War?</h2>
<p>The North had several advantages over the South at the outset of the Civil War. The North had a larger population, a greater industrial base, a greater amount of wealth, and an established government.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-the-north-in-the-civil-war>What are the strengths and weaknesses of the North in the Civil War?</h2>
<p>Its land contained most of the country’s iron, coal, copper, and gold. The North controlled the seas, and its 21,000 miles of railroad track allowed troops and supplies to be transported wherever they were needed. The North’s greatest weakness was its military leadership.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-weaknesses-of-the-north-and-south>What were the weaknesses of the North and South?</h2>
<p>The North had twice the density of railroads per square mile. There was not even one rifleworks in the entire South. The South was at a severe disadvantage when it came to manufacturing, but the Confederacy managed to keep its guns firing by creating ammunition from melted-down bells from churches and town squares.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-biggest-problem-the-north-faced-during-the-civil-war>What was the biggest problem the North faced during the Civil War?</h2>
<p>One of the struggles that the North had to contend with was that many people—mainly Northern Democrats—were dead set against the war. They felt that some kind of political compromise could’ve been achieved with the South on the fraught issue of slavery without the need for armed conflict.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-the-north-and-south>What was the strengths and weaknesses of the north and South?</h2>
<p>Comparing the Strengths and Weaknesses of the North and South The Civil War was a very gruesome war fought between the Union in the North and the Confederates in the South. The Union was a very factory-dependent area while the Confederacy was dependent on farmland, which ended up in two very distinct areas.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-the-civil-war>What was the strengths and weaknesses of the Civil War?</h2>
<p>2017 Civil War Strengths and Weaknesses The Civil War was a very gruesome war. The war had become the Union (North) and the Confederacy (South). During the war the union and confederacy had many weaknesses and strengths. Some of them are technology, army/military and government.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-souths-weakness-in-the-revolutionary-war>What was the south’s weakness in the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>trained soldiers – hunting skills and attended military school South Strength believed in the cause because it was for their independence South Weakness few railroads to transport troops and supplies South Weakness small population to volunteer for army and make supplies South Weakness Few factories to make supplies and weapons North Weakness</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-norths-advantage-in-the-civil-war>What was the north’s advantage in the Civil War?</h2>
<p>North Advantages and Disadvantages. 1. The North had factories to produce ammunition and guns to keep the troops stocked, but didn’t have much agriculture like the South. 2. The North had 22,000 miles of railroad and canals to transport food and supplies to the soldiers. 3.</p>
