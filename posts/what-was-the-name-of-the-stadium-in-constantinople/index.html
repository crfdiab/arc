<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-stadium-in-constantinople>What was the name of the stadium in Constantinople?</h2>
<p>Hippodrome of Constantinople, located in Sultanahmet/Istanbul, was a public arena mainly for chariot races. The word hippodrome comes from the Greek hippos (horse) and dromos (way).</p>
<h2 id=was-is-the-difference-between-the-colosseum-of-rome-and-the-hippodrome-of-constantinople>Was is the difference between the Colosseum of Rome and the Hippodrome of Constantinople?</h2>
<p>The hippodrome (Greek: ἱππόδρομος) was an ancient Greek stadium for horse racing and chariot racing. The Colosseum in Rome, Italy, is a large amphitheater that hosted events like gladiatorial games.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-byzantine-empire-surround>What did the Byzantine Empire surround?</h2>
<p>Where was the Byzantine Empire? At its greatest extent, the Byzantine Empire covered much of the land surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, including what is now Italy, Greece, and Turkey along with portions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-hippodrome-in-constantinople>How big was the hippodrome in Constantinople?</h2>
<p>about 450 m<br>
It is estimated that the Hippodrome of Constantine was about 450 m (1,476 ft) long and 130 m (427 ft) wide. The carceres (starting gates) stood at the northern end; and the sphendone (curved tribune of the U-shaped structure, the lower part of which still survives) stood at the southern end.</p>
<h2 id=did-rome-have-a-hippodrome>Did Rome have a hippodrome?</h2>
<p>Remember, in the Roman world, the Greek hippodrome became the Roman circus. One of the largest such structures was the Circus Maximus in Rome. It was more than four stories tall and could seat more than 100,000 people.</p>
<h2 id=which-language-did-most-people-in-constantinople-speak>Which language did most people in Constantinople speak?</h2>
<p>The common and, for most of the life of the Byzantine empire, official language was Greek. When the Roman empire moved into the culturally Greek east, Latin was imposed as the language of government, but most people continued to speak Greek. It likewise continued to be the language of poetry and scholarship.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-constantinople-become-so-wealthy>How did Constantinople become so wealthy?</h2>
<p>Describe the city of Constantinople. The city was rich and successful for so long because it was well protected by water on three sides and had land and sea walls. It was also at the center of trade which gave it wealth. It had trade routes to Europe and Asia and it had accesses to the Mediterranean and Black seas.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-roman-amphitheatre-when-it-was-built>How big was the Roman amphitheatre when it was built?</h2>
<p>Built from 72 to 80 AD, it remains as an icon of ancient Rome. Its building and arena dimensions are 188 × 156 and 86 × 54 meters respectively. It was commissioned by the Emperor Vespasian for the capital city of the ancient Roman Empire from 70–80 AD but was not completed and opened until 80 AD by his son Titus, as a gift for the people of Rome.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-6th-largest-surviving-roman-amphitheater>Which is the 6th largest surviving Roman amphitheater?</h2>
<p>Currently, the amphitheater in Pula is the 6th largest surviving Roman amphitheater. Of course, the Colosseum is the biggest one, and others well preserved are the amphitheatres in Capua, Verona, Arles and Catania. As for the degree of preservation, Pula’s amphitheater is on par with the amphitheatres in Nimes, Arles, Verona and Pompeii.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-ancient-romans-use-the-amphitheatre-for>What did the ancient Romans use the amphitheatre for?</h2>
<p>Roman amphitheatres are amphitheatres – large, circular or oval open-air venues with raised seating – built by the ancient Romans. They were used for events such as gladiator combats, venationes (animal slayings) and executions.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-amphitheatre-that-spartacus-fought-in>How big was the amphitheatre that Spartacus fought in?</h2>
<p>It was erected by Augustus in the first century B.C. and could hold up to 60,000 spectators. It is known as the arena that Spartacus fought in in 73 B.C. The theatre was eventually destroyed by the Vandals in their invasion of Rome in 456 AD.</p>
