<p>sugar cane<br>
1﻿﻿2﻿﻿ Approximately 80% of the world’s sugar is produced from sugar cane in tropical and subtropical climates. The remaining 20% comes from sugar beets, which are grown mostly in the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere. A total of over 120 countries produce sugar.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-largest-producers-of-sugar-in-the-world>Who are the largest producers of sugar in the world?</h2>

<p>Sugarcane cultivated area grew from 7 million to 7.8 million hectares of land from 2007 to 2008, mainly using abandoned pasture lands. In 2008 Brazil has 276 million hectares of arable land, 72% use for pasture, 16.9% for grain crops, and 2.8% for sugarcane, meaning that ethanol is just requiring approximately 1.5%…</p>
