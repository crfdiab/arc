<h2 id=what-large-portion-of-georgia-was-underwater>What large portion of Georgia was underwater?</h2>
<p>Petersburg, Georgia is now an underwater ghost town after the Army Corps of Engineers flooded more than 72,000 acres to build what is today called Thurmond Lake.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-ago-was-georgia-under-water>How long ago was Georgia under water?</h2>
<p>During the Mississippian Period (359 to 318 million years ago), thick deposits of limestone and chert formed in the warm, shallow sea that covered northwestern Georgia and much of central North America. Animals inhabiting this sea included Archimedes bryozoans, blastoids, brachiopods, corals, and crinoids.</p>
<h2 id=what-region-of-georgia-was-underwater>What region of Georgia was underwater?</h2>
<p>Southern Georgia remained submerged by shallow seawater into the ensuing Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era. These seas were home to relatively small coral reefs. During the Paleocene, Georgia was home to foraminiferans, mollusks, and sea urchins.</p>
<h2 id=what-hemisphere-is-the-state-of-georgia-in>What hemisphere is the state of Georgia in?</h2>
<p>western hemisphere<br>
Georgia is located on the planet Earth. It is in the northern and the western hemisphere (half of the Earth). It can be found on the North American continent in the country of the United States of America. Georgia is located in the southeastern region of the USA.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-any-volcanoes-in-georgia>Is there any volcanoes in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Here’s a little secret that not many people are aware of: there are volcanos that exist in the North Georgia Mountains. The dormant volcano actually last erupted in 1857, and has been remaining still ever since. …</p>
<h2 id=which-are-the-most-common-fossils-found-in-georgia>Which are the most common fossils found in Georgia?</h2>
<p>shelled cephalopods<br>
The shelled cephalopods are the most common to be found as fossils. Among these, two groups are found in Coastal Plain deposits: the extinct ammonites of the Late Cretaceous, and the nautilids, which still exist and reach back to well before the Mesozoic.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-state-of-georgia-in-the-southern-hemisphere>Is the state of Georgia in the Southern Hemisphere?</h2>
<p>Georgia is located in the Northern Hemisphere. Georgia is located in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-dangerous-lake-in-georgia>What is the most dangerous lake in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Lake Lanier<br>
Lake Lanier: Georgia’s most popular—and dangerous—lake. Lake Lanier is a reservoir created by the dammed-up Chattahoochee River. It’s located in the middle of northern Georgia, about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta and about 100 miles south of the Tennessee border.</p>
