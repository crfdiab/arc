<h2 id=what-were-some-of-the-causes-and-effects-of-early-exploration-and-settlement-in-the-americas>What were some of the causes and effects of early exploration and settlement in the Americas?</h2>
<p>Some basic effects of Europeans coming to North America are that the Native Americans caught new diseases which included smallpox, influenza, measles, and chicken pox. Explorers used superior fire power, like single shot muskets, to conquer natives.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-effects-of-the-columbian-exchange>What are two effects of the Columbian Exchange?</h2>
<p>The Columbian Exchange caused population growth in Europe by bringing new crops from the Americas and started Europe’s economic shift towards capitalism. Colonization disrupted ecosytems, bringing in new organisms like pigs, while completely eliminating others like beavers.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-struggles-of-jamestown>What were the struggles of Jamestown?</h2>
<p>The winter of 1609-1610 in Jamestown is referred to as the “starving time.” Disease, violence, drought, a meager harvest followed by a harsh winter, and poor drinking water left the majority of colonists dead that winter.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-spanish-come-to-california-in-1769>Why did the Spanish come to California in 1769?</h2>
<p>The decision by the Spanish to finally establish settlements in California in 1769 was spurred by fears that rival European powers such as Russia or England would seize it and threaten New Spain. Known as the Sacred Expedition, this party was led by Captain Gaspar de Portola and Father Junipero Serra.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-permanent-settlement-on-the-california-coast>What was the first permanent settlement on the California coast?</h2>
<p>San Diego, the first permanent European settlement on the Pacific Coast, was established in 1769. With the expedition was Father Junipero Serra, a Franciscan Father who would have a tremendous influence in the colonization of California through the establishment of missions. At San Diego, Serra</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-spanish-not-settle-in-baja-california>Why did the Spanish not settle in Baja California?</h2>
<p>Coastal winds and currents made the voyage north difficult, and Spanish captains failed to find safe harbors for their crafts. Baja California became the northwest limit of Spanish colonization, and even there, efforts to settle the area and bring native tribes to Christianity and European ways were halfhearted at best.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-early-people-of-california-survive>How did the early people of California survive?</h2>
<p>The region’s lack of rain during the growing season meant that agriculture was not a practical means of livelihood for early Californians, but the gentle climate and rich soil enabled these groups to live by skillfully harvesting and processing wild nuts and berries and by capturing the fish that crowded the streams.</p>
