<h2 id=what-animal-live-in-the-everglades>What animal live in the Everglades?</h2>
<p>The Everglades National Park is the largest surviving subtropical wilderness in the contiguous United States. Some of the significant animals that are found here include the American alligator, Florida panther, West Indian manatee, wood stork, bald eagle, and American crocodile.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-habitats-found-in-the-everglades>What are 3 habitats found in the Everglades?</h2>
<p>Four of the major habitat types found in the Everglades are sawgrass marshes, hammocks, pinelands, and mangroves. A habitat is a home for plants and/or animals and needs to provide food, water, shelter and space (territory).</p>
<h2 id=why-do-animals-live-in-the-everglades>Why do animals live in the Everglades?</h2>
<p>The living creatures of the Everglades are one of the main reasons for the need to protect the area as they include some of the most endangered species on the planet. Many species of marine creatures, birds, fish, mammals and reptiles all live within the diverse ecosystems of the National Park.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-different-animals-live-in-the-everglades>How many different animals live in the Everglades?</h2>
<p>The Everglades are literally brimming with incredible birds. In fact, there are over 350 different species alone.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-unique-about-the-everglades>What is unique about the Everglades?</h2>
<p>The Everglades is the largest subtropical wetland ecosystem in North America and the largest mangrove ecosystem in Western Hemisphere. The Everglades is often referred to as a “swamp”, but in reality it is a giant, slow moving river. Nearly 8 million Floridians rely on the Everglades for their daily water supply.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-tigers-in-the-everglades>Are there tigers in the Everglades?</h2>
<p>You might not associate tigers with the Everglades, and you’d be right—they’re not native to the Florida grasslands. But our animal sanctuary is home to Boris and Daisy, two Siberian tigers who have lived there for decades.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-people-that-lived-in-the-everglades>Who are the people that lived in the Everglades?</h2>
<p>Humans were living in the Florida Everglades area as long as 15,000 years ago. Two major tribes – the Calusa Indians and the Tequesta Indians – lived as hunter-gatherers on the edges of the rich Florida Everglades ecosystems. Humans were living in the Florida Everglades area as long as 15,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-ecosystem-is-the-everglades-in-florida>What kind of ecosystem is the Everglades in Florida?</h2>
<p>The Florida Everglades is a huge subtropical wetland of sawgrass marshes in a complex system of interdependent ecosystems. These ecosystems include cypress swamps, the estuarine mangrove forests of the Ten Thousand Islands, tropical hardwood hammocks, pine rockland, and the salt water marine environment of Florida Bay in the Keys.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fish-live-in-the-everglades>What kind of fish live in the Everglades?</h2>
<p>Female mosquitoes, who feed on blood, feast with abandon during this period to maintain the necessary protein levels to lay eggs, according to the National Park Service. The mosquito larvae are a food source for several fish species, including the Everglades Pygmy Sunfish.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-seminoles-left-in-the-everglades>Are there any Seminoles left in the Everglades?</h2>
<p>Many surnames of Seminole origin still survive in the areas around the Florida Everglades. Some typical ones include Osceola, Billie and Bowlegs. The Seminoles are the only Indian nation never to sign a peace treaty with the U.S. Their legacy of never surrendering is proudly carried on by the Florida State Seminole athletic program.</p>
