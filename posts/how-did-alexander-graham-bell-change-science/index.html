<p>Alexander Graham Bell is most famous for his invention of the telephone. He first became interested in the science of sound because both his mother and wife were deaf. His experiments in sound eventually let him to want to send voice signals down a telegraph wire. They formed the Bell Telephone Company in 1877.</p>

Alexander Graham Bell/Inventions</p>
<p>Alexander Graham Bell, best known for his invention of the telephone, revolutionized communication as we know it. His interest in sound technology was deep-rooted and personal, as both his wife and mother were deaf.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-contribution-of-alexander-graham-bell-as-scientists-in-his-time-in-relation-to-the-sound-waves>What is the contribution of Alexander Graham Bell as scientists in his time in relation to the sound waves?</h2>
<p>Among his 30 patented inventions, Bell created the audiometer, which he used to test the hearing of hundreds of people, including children. This device is still used today to measure how well a person can hear.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-alexander-graham-bell-invent-what-was-the-impact-on-industry>What did Alexander Graham Bell invent what was the impact on industry?</h2>
<p>A significant invention of the late period of the Industrial Revolution was the telephone, which was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. Throughout the 1860s and 1870s, Bell carried out numerous experiments all centered around human speech and the use of technology to carry human made sounds long distances.</p>
<h2 id=who-created-decibels>Who created decibels?</h2>
<p>inventor Alexander Graham Bell<br>
Decibel: Named after the inventor Alexander Graham Bell, a decibel (dBA) is the unit used to express the intensity of sound. It is normally measured using the “A” scale, which approximates the human ear’s response to a wide range of frequencies. A decibel is a logarithmic value to the base 10.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-mr-watson-receive-bells-message>How did Mr Watson receive Bell’s message?</h2>
<p>The first discernible speech is transmitted over a telephone system when inventor Alexander Graham Bell summons his assistant in another room by saying, “Mr. Watson, come here; I want you.” Bell had received a comprehensive telephone patent just three days before.</p>
<h2 id=how-alexander-graham-bell-invented-telephone>How Alexander Graham Bell invented telephone?</h2>
<p>Thomas A. Watson, one of Bell’s assistants, was trying to reactivate a telegraph transmitter. Hearing the sound, Bell believed that he could solve the problem of sending a human voice over a wire. He figured out how to transmit a simple current first, and received a patent for that invention on March 7, 1876.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-first-phone-work>How did the first phone work?</h2>
<p>Alexander Graham Bell’s original telephone, patented in 1876, worked by converting sound into an electrical signal via a ‘liquid transmitter’. When sound waves hit the membrane, it caused vibrations, varying the strength of the current passing between the needle and the contact.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-noise>Who discovered noise?</h2>
<p>It is known for sure that later on another Italian, Galileo Galilei, discovered more of the properties of sound waves. He discovered that the frequency of the sound wave is the factor that determines what pitch the sound will have. He discovered this in or around the 1660s.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-alexander-graham-bells-telephone>What was the impact of Alexander Graham Bell’s telephone?</h2>
<p>His invention of the telephone made Bell a wealthy man. In turn, the telephone allowed communication across great distances and is one of the single most significant inventions that led to the modern age.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-inventions-did-alexander-graham-bell-make>What kind of inventions did Alexander Graham Bell make?</h2>
<p>Alexander Graham Bell: Alexander Graham Bell was a famous inventor. While others also contributed to its invention, he’s remembered as the person who invented the first working telephone. Bell also invented a metal detector. Alexander Graham Bell was awarded 18 individual patents and shared 12 patents with other inventors.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-alexander-graham-bell-contribute-to-eugenics>How did Alexander Graham Bell contribute to eugenics?</h2>
<p>Bell’s Legacy. Bell applied his study of eugenics to his goal of preventing the creation of a deaf race and presented his paper Memoir Upon the Formation of a Deaf Variety of the Human Race to the National Academy of Sciences in 1883.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-alexander-graham-bells-death>What was the cause of Alexander Graham Bell’s death?</h2>
<p>Death and Significance. Bell died in 1922 at Beinn Bhreagh, due to complications from diabetes. Best known as the inventor of the telephone, he spent much of his life teaching the deaf and considered it his most important contribution. Moreover, the telephone was only one of Bell’s many inventions and innovations.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-alexander-graham-bell-born-and-raised>Where was Alexander Graham Bell born and raised?</h2>
<p>Alexander Graham Bell was a Scottish-born American inventor and scientist. Bell was born on March 3, 1847, in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1870 Bell and his family emigrated to Canada.</p>
