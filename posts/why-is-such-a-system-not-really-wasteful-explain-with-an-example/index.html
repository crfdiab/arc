<h2 id=why-is-such-a-system-not-really-wasteful-explain-with-an-example>Why is such a system not really wasteful explain with an example?</h2>
<p>Such a system is not really wasteful because although a graphical user interface may waste CPU cycles, but by maximizing the use of the system, it optimizes the user’s interaction with the system.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-difficulty-that-a-programmer-must-overcome-in-writing-an-operating-system-for-a-real-time-environment>What is the main difficulty that a programmer must overcome in writing an operating system for a real time environment?</h2>
<p>1.3 What is the main difficulty that a programmer must overcome in writing an operating system for a real-time environment? Answer: The main difficulty is keeping the operating system within the fixed time constraints of a real-time system.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-an-operating-system-in-a-computer-system-mention-at-least-3-reasons>Why do we need an operating system in a computer system mention at least 3 reasons?</h2>
<p>An operating system has three main functions: (1) manage the computer’s resources, such as the central processing unit, memory, disk drives, and printers, (2) establish a user interface, and (3) execute and provide services for applications software. Thus you both establish a user interface and execute software.</p>
<h2 id=what-resources-does-an-operating-system-use>What resources does an operating system use?</h2>
<p>Typical resources include the central processing unit (CPU), computer memory, file storage, input/output (I/O) devices, and network connections. Management tasks include scheduling resource use to avoid conflicts and interference between programs.</p>
<h2 id=should-an-operating-system-include-a-web-browser>Should an operating system include a Web browser?</h2>
<p>Answer: Point. Applications such as web browsers and email tools are performing an increasingly important role in modern desktop computer systems. To fulfill this role, they should be incorporated as part of the operating system.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-general-methods-for-passing-parameters-to-the-operating-system>What are the three general methods for passing parameters to the operating system?</h2>
<p>There are three main methods to pass the parameters required for a system call: (1) Pass the parameters in registers (this may prove insufficient when there are more parameters than registers). (2) Store the parameters in a block, or table, in memory, and pass the address of block as a parameter in a register.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-mode-of-the-system-when-a-user-program-is-running>What is the mode of the system when a user program is running?</h2>
<p>The system is in user mode when the operating system is running a user application such as handling a text editor. The transition from user mode to kernel mode occurs when the application requests the help of operating system or an interrupt or a system call occurs. The mode bit is set to 1 in the user mode.</p>
<h2 id=is-switching-from-user-to-kernel-mode-privileged>Is switching from user to kernel mode privileged?</h2>
<p>The instruction to switch to kernel mode is an example of a privileged instruction.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-real-life-examples-of-operating-system>What are the real life examples of operating system?</h2>
<p>Popular Operating systems for computer system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows – Versions: Windows 10, 8, 7, XP, 98…</li>
<li>Apple OS – Versions: Mojave, Catalina, Mac OS X.</li>
<li>Linux – Versions – Red Hat, KDE….</li>
<li>Ubuntu.</li>
<li>Chrome OS.</li>
<li>Fedora.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-the-goals-of-an-operating-system>What are the goals of an operating system?</h2>
<p>What are the main goals of operating system? An operating system has three main functions: (1) manage the computer’s resources, such as the central processing unit, memory, disk drives, and printers, (2) establish a user interface, and (3) execute and provide services for applications software.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-it-appropriate-for-an-operating-system-to-make-efficient-use>When is it appropriate for an operating system to make efficient use?</h2>
<p>We Have Stressed The Need For An Operating System To Make Efficient Use Of The Computing Hardware. When Is It Appropriate For The Operating System To Forsake This Principle And To “Waste” Resources? Why Is Such A System Not Really Wasteful? Single-user systems should maximize use of the system for the user.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-such-a-system-not-really-wasteful>Why is such a system not really wasteful?</h2>
<p>Why Is Such A System Not Really Wasteful? Single-user systems should maximize use of the system for the user. A GUI might “waste” CPU cycles, but it optimizes the user’s interaction with the system. For example, when we use PCs or handheld computers, it’s appropriate for the operating system to forsake this principle and to “waste” resources.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-an-operating-system-waste-cpu-cycles>When does an operating system waste CPU cycles?</h2>
<p>A GUI might “waste” CPU cycles, but it optimizes the user’s interaction with the system. For example, when we use PCs or handheld computers, it’s appropriate for the operating system to forsake this principle and to “waste” resources.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-rest-of-the-operating-system-performed>How is the rest of the operating system performed?</h2>
<p>The rest can be performed in user mode. 1.7 Some early computers protected the operating system by placing it in a memory partition that could not be modiﬁed by either the user job or the operating system itself. Describe two difﬁculties that you think could arise with such a scheme.</p>
