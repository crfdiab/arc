<h2 id=what-reforms-occurred-in-russia-under-czar-alexander-ii>What reforms occurred in Russia under Czar Alexander II?</h2>
<p>Tsar Alexander II initiated a series of important reforms in Russia. During his reign, the country’s rail and communication networks were improved, resulting in increased economic activity and the development of banking institutions.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-cause-of-russias-lack-of-reforms-throughout-the-1800s>What was the main cause of Russia’s lack of reforms throughout the 1800s?</h2>
<p>The cause of Russia remaining weak even though the country had the largest territory and population of any European nation by the mid-1800s was that they were behind in the industrial development. They were behind because most of Russia’s extensive natural resources laid undeveloped.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-reform-movement-in-russia>What caused reform movement in Russia?</h2>
<p>causes. Historians have long debated the causes for the Great Reforms. Marxist historians of the former Soviet Union identified economic crisis in the serf economy and increasing peasant disorders before 1861 as proofs of the “crisis of feudalism” and the rising political consciousness of the working masses.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-successful-of-the-great-reforms-in-russia>What was the most successful of the great reforms in Russia?</h2>
<p>Judiciary. The judicial reforms were among the most successful and consistent of all his reforms. A completely new court system and order of legal proceedings were established.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-key-to-social-reform-in-russia>What was the key to social reform in Russia?</h2>
<p>The key to social reform in Russia was the emancipation of the serfs.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-abolition-of-serfdom-controversial>Why was the abolition of serfdom controversial?</h2>
<p>The most controversial aspect of the act was the land settlement. Initially the serfs remained under their obligations for a two-year period during which the government compiled inventories of land ownership. This meant that the former serfs were financially tied to the communes.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-tsar-nicholas-ii-do-to-the-opposition>What did Tsar Nicholas II do to the opposition?</h2>
<p>Opposition to the tsar grew and Nicholas was forced to grant a constitution and establish a parliament, the Duma. Nicholas’s concessions were only limited. Changes were made in the voting laws to prevent the election of radicals and the secret police continued to crush opposition.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-last-tsar-of-russia-to-be-deposed>Who was the last Tsar of Russia to be deposed?</h2>
<p>Nicholas II (1868-1918) Nicholas II, 1914 © Nicholas II was the last tsar of Russia. He was deposed during the Russian Revolution and executed by the Bolsheviks.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-year-of-nicholas-iis-reign>What was the first year of Nicholas II’s reign?</h2>
<p>Unlike those who talk about the unpreparedness, weakness and lack of will of Nicholas II, Russian historian Andrei Anatolyevich Borisyuk, is convinced that the Emperor knew what the country needed during the first years of his reign, and brilliantly fulfilled his mission as sovereign.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-reformers-do-in-the-russian-revolution>What did the reformers do in the Russian Revolution?</h2>
<p>These zemstva were given authority to deliver education, dispense charitable relief and other services. Alexander II the ‘reformer tsar’ also ordered the reformation of the army and navy, the implementation of new legal processes and an overhaul of the penal code.</p>
