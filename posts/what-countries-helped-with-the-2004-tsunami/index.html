<p>In response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, World Vision mounted its largest-ever relief response across five countries simultaneously — Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, and Myanmar — and raised more than $350 million.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-world-vision-help-with-the-2004-tsunami>How did World Vision help with the 2004 tsunami?</h2>
<p>World Vision emphasised the importance of accountability and integrity from the very beginning of the Tsunami response. New structures, systems, and policies were established to ensure a high level of transparency, in addition to a continuous internal audit function.</p>
<h2 id=who-helped-after-the-indian-ocean-tsunami>Who helped after the Indian Ocean tsunami?</h2>
<p>Humanitarian response $34.4 million for Indonesia. $21.5 million for Sri Lanka. $8.3 million for regional assistance across multiple countries. $4.3 million for Maldives.</p>
<h2 id=who-donated-money-to-the-2004-tsunami>Who donated money to the 2004 tsunami?</h2>
<p>Oxfam New Zealand contributed almost NZ$2 million through generous donations from the public and an extra $1.3 million in matching grants from the New Zealand Government.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-was-donated-to-the-boxing-day-tsunami>How much money was donated to the Boxing Day tsunami?</h2>
<p>You, the Australian public, donated over $42 million to CARE Australia after the devastating tsunami in December 2004. This allowed us to make a huge contribution to CARE’s global response.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-did-the-2004-tsunami-cost>How much money did the 2004 tsunami cost?</h2>
<p>For example, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, with a death toll of over 230,000 people, cost a ‘mere’ $15 billion, whereas in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, in which 11 people died, the damages were six-fold.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-world-help-after-the-tsunami>How did the world help after the tsunami?</h2>
<p>(CNN) — Gargantuan global relief efforts are gaining momentum as countries and aid organizations donate money, supplies and personnel to areas ravaged by earthquake-triggered tsunamis. Nations around the world have pledged money to help recovery from deadly waves that hit coastal areas of the Indian Ocean.</p>

<h2 id=who-is-giving-aid-to-indonesia-after-tsunami>Who is giving aid to Indonesia after tsunami?</h2>
<p>North Korea has pledged $150,000 to the aid effort in Indonesia. The Government has raised its offer of aid to $764m over five years. Half of this sum is in bilateral loans. Prime Minister John Howard has been sceptical about supporting the debt relief initiatve being pushed by other wealthy countries.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-humanitarian-response-to-the-tsunami-in-indonesia>What was the humanitarian response to the tsunami in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>Corruption, bureaucracy and nationalism hampered the humanitarian response in Indonesia. In Sri Lanka, only 30% of those eligible affected by the tsunami as of 10 February had received any aid, and there were allegations of local officials giving aid only to their supporters, some of whom were not victims of the tsunami.</p>
