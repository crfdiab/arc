<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-gravitational-force-between-two-bodies-if-the-mass-of-one-of-the-bodies-is-halved-and-the-distance-between-them-is-doubled>What happens to the gravitational force between two bodies if the mass of one of the bodies is halved and the distance between them is doubled?</h2>
<p>(b) If we halve the distance between two bodies, then the gravitational force becomes four times.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-gravitational-force-between-two-bodies-change-if-distance-between-them-is-tripled-it-becomes>How does the gravitational force between two bodies change if distance between them is tripled it becomes?</h2>
<p>Answer: If the distance between the two objects is tripled, then Thus, the gravitational force between the two objects becomes one-ninth. (iii) If the masses of both the objects are doubled, then Thus, the gravitational force between the two objects becomes 4 times.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-force-of-gravitation>How does the force of gravitation?</h2>
<p>So as the mass of either object increases, the force of gravitational attraction between them also increases. If the mass of one of the objects is tripled, then the force of gravity between them is tripled. If the mass of both of the objects is doubled, then the force of gravity between them is quadrupled; and so on.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-heavier-ball-fall-faster-than-a-lighter-ball>Does a heavier ball fall faster than a lighter ball?</h2>
<p>Answer 2: No, heavier objects fall as fast (or slow) as lighter objects, if we ignore the air friction. The air friction can make a difference, but in a rather complicated way. The gravitational acceleration for all objects is the same.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-gravitational-force-between-two-bodies-change>How does gravitational force between two bodies change?</h2>
<p>How does gravitational force between two bodies change if a)Mass of one body is doubled but distance remains the same b)If masses of both bodies are doubled but distance remains the same c)Masses remain the same but distance is tripled a) if mass of one body is doubled but the distance remains same; the gravitational force becomes twice</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-force-between-two-objects-related>How is the force between two objects related?</h2>
<p>We know that According to the law of gravitation, the force between any two objects of mass M and m is directly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Was this answer helpful?</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-the-distance-between-two-objects-is-reduced-to-half>What happens if the distance between two objects is reduced to half?</h2>
<p>According to the Newton’s gravitational law, if the distant between two objects is reduced to half, assuming the objects either a puntiform masses or exacting spheres, the gravitational force’s numerical values become 4 times stronger because of the force dependent with the inverse of the square of the distant. G → universal gravitational constant.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-universal-law-of-gravitation-important>Why is the universal law of gravitation important?</h2>
<p>The universal law of gravitation successfully explained many phenomena occurring in nature. 1. The force that binds us to the earth. 2. The motion of the moon around the earth. 3. The motion of planets around the sun. 4. The tides due to the moon and the sun.</p>
