<h2 id=is-spain-in-south-or-north-of-europe>Is Spain in south or North of Europe?</h2>
<p>Portugal and Spain are classified as “Southwestern Europe”, while Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Turkey (the part west of the Bosporus) are described as located in “Southeastern Europe”.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-spain-location>Where is Spain location?</h2>
<p>Europe<br>
Spain is located on the Iberian Peninsula, in the southwest corner of Europe. It shares the peninsula with Portugal, but Spain occupies the lion’s share—about five-sixths. Spain has Portugal to the west and France to the north. The rest of the country borders on water…and often on beach (more on that later).</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-world-part-of-spain-located-on>Which is the world part of Spain located on?</h2>
<p>So to conclude: Spain lies in the continent of Eurasia and in the ‘world part’ of Europe. Continents and ‘world parts’ werelddelen (Nl.) (There is no English word for this.) The Continents are: Eurasia, Africa, America, Australia, Antarctica. The ‘world parts’: Europe, Asia, Africa, North-America, South-America, Oceania, Antarctica.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-canary-islands-part-of-the-european-continent>Is the Canary Islands part of the European continent?</h2>
<p>So to conclude: Spain lies in the continent of Eurasia and in the ‘world part’ of Europe. Some territories part of Spain are considered part of the African continent/world part: mainly the Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla. This is how it works in Belgium and the Netherlands. Originally Answered: What continent is Spain in? Spain is in Europe.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-land-border-between-spain-and-france>What is the land border between Spain and France?</h2>
<p>The Spanish mainland is bordered to the south and east almost entirely by the Mediterranean Sea (except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar); to the north by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west by the Atlantic Ocean and Portugal.</p>
