<p>The heat in Phoenix is very bearable due to the low humidity, extremely good HVAC infrastructure, and local habits. I would take a 100F in Phoenix over Portland anyday since half of Portland doesn’t have AC. Also understand it isn’t really HOT until May and starts to cool down by November.</p>

<p>Hispanic culture remains a strong influence in the area, evidenced in architecture, festivals and cuisine. While Arizona is one of the go-to spots for retirees, more than a quarter of the population is under 20 years old. Greater Phoenix is also home to Arizona State University, which draws a lot of younger people to the area.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-move-to-phoenix-every-year>How many people move to Phoenix every year?</h2>
<p>More than 16 million people travel to metro Phoenix every year. In fact, a good number of those tourists become residents, which helps solidify the area as a city of transplants. Moving to Phoenix was a deliberate choice for many of its 1.6 million inhabitants, and you’ll be hard pressed to find a ton of native Phoenicians that grew up in the area.</p>

<p>Residents enjoy living in Phoenix for the same reason more than 20 million visitors flock to the metro area yearly: the weather. In the winter, daytime highs are mild, and springtime hits as early as late January, with cactus blossoms and wildflowers blooming.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-love-to-live-in-arizona>Why do people love to live in Arizona?</h2>
<p>Having come from a part of the country known for concrete and skyscrapers, I never tire of seeing mountains, hearing and seeing birds, seeing stars at night, and Arizona sunsets. I still get excited when I see a jackrabbit or a coyote. I love the desert in bloom. You knew I had to mention the weather. I love the weather.</p>
