<h2 id=what-types-of-crops-did-peasants-grow-during-the-middle-ages>What types of crops did peasants grow during the Middle Ages?</h2>
<p>Common crops produced in the Middle Ages included wheat, beans, barley, peas and oats. Most farmers had a spring and a fall crop. The spring crop often produced barley and beans while the fall crop produced wheat and rye. The wheat and rye were used for bread or sold to make money.</p>
<h2 id=what-crops-did-serfs-grow>What crops did serfs grow?</h2>
<p>Serfs used a long scythe to cut the tall grass. Then they let it dry to make hay, which had many uses including stuffing for their mattresses. In the fall, the serfs harvested their crops of rye, oats, peas, and barley. If the weather had been good, the harvest would be good.</p>
<h2 id=what-crops-were-grown-in-medieval-england>What crops were grown in medieval England?</h2>
<p>From today’s view, the main crops of Medieval England were: wheat, barley, oats and rye. Peas, beans and vetches were also produced in the field, but legumes like peas, were served more ”as vegetables for the famuli” instead of grains.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-peasants-harvest>What did peasants harvest?</h2>
<p>Peas, beans and onions were grown in the peasants’ gardens (tofts). These vegetables were used to make a thick type of stew called pottage. Apple and pear trees were planted in the orchard or in the peasants’ own gardens to provide fruit. Berry bushes were sometimes also planted to ensure a supply of berries.</p>
<h2 id=did-peasants-have-free-time>Did peasants have free time?</h2>
<p>Plowing and harvesting were backbreaking toil, but the peasant enjoyed anywhere from eight weeks to half the year off. There were labor-free Sundays, and when the plowing and harvesting seasons were over, the peasant got time to rest, too.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-acres-did-a-peasant-farm>How many acres did a peasant farm?</h2>
<p>From Medieval Manors I learn that a single peasant farmer worked 20-40 acres of land, so let’s settle on 30 acres. From Google, I learn that 1 square mile is 640 acres, so that square mile that could support 180 people means about 21 peasant farmers worth of land in a square mile.</p>
<h2 id=what-foods-did-peasants-grow-in-medieval-times>What foods did peasants grow in medieval times?</h2>
<p>In their tofts they grew garden vegetables appropriate to their climate, including radishes, celery, carrots, cabbage, onions, lettuce, and spinach. They also might have a few fruit and nut A medieval lord prepared lists of customary rents and services that he was owed and generally bound them together in a book known in England as a custumal.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-peasants-do-for-a-living>What did the peasants do for a living?</h2>
<p>Even if the land switched owners, the peasants could not leave to go work elsewhere. The peasants (farmers) used irrigation to ensure that their crops would grow and prosper. They were responsible to hoe and plow the land, plant seeds, and take care of the crops.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-farmers-do-in-the-middle-ages>What did farmers do in the Middle Ages?</h2>
<p>Farming in the Middle Ages was done by peasants and serfs. Peasant farmers made just enough money to live on while serfs had no rights and were all but slaves to the lords whose land they lived on. Some serf farmers eventually earned rights in exchange for back-breaking work seven days a week and on-command service to their lord.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fertilisers-did-medieval-farmers-use>What kind of fertilisers did medieval farmers use?</h2>
<p>The use of manure was basic and artificial fertilisers as we would know did not exist. Growing crops was a very hit and miss affair and a successful crop was due to a lot of hard work but also the result of some luck. In the summer (the growing season) farmers needed sun to get their crops to grow.</p>
