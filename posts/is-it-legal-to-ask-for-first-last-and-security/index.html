<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-ask-for-first-last-and-security>Is it legal to ask for first last and security?</h2>
<p>A California landlord may collect the first month’s rent, plus a security deposit. Any amount over the first month’s rent is deposit. In other words, they cannot collect “last month’s rent” in advance — legally it’s a security deposit.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-landlord-ask-for-first-and-last-month-rent-plus-security-in-los-angeles>Can a landlord ask for first and last month rent plus security in Los Angeles?</h2>
<p>For a furnished residence, landlords can charge up to three times the rent in addition to the first month’s rent. Civil Code §1950.5(c). Security Deposit as Last Month’s Rent Tenants cannot elect to use the security deposit as the last month’s rent.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-landlord-ask-for-more-than-the-deposit>Can a landlord ask for more than the deposit?</h2>
<p>Yes. A landlord can ask for extra money to cover the cost of damages greater than the security deposit. Landlords may need to take legal action to recover extra money. the cost of fixing the damage is more than the security deposit.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-landlord-ask-for-first-and-last-month-rent-in-bc>Can a landlord ask for first and last month rent in BC?</h2>
<p>Landlords: Cannot request deposits based on rules and procedures used in other areas (for example, landlords can’t ask for “first and last month’s rent” or “key money”) Cannot increase the amount of a deposit with a rent increase. Cannot automatically keep all or part of the deposit at the end of the tenancy.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-landlord-ask-for-rent-upfront>Can a landlord ask for rent upfront?</h2>
<p>But the National Residential Landlords Association says it advises against big upfront payments. “We would encourage landlords to look for alternatives to asking for high levels of rent upfront. But there is no legal limit on how many months’ rent can be asked for in advance.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-landlord-hold-your-deposit>Can a landlord hold your deposit?</h2>
<p>Your landlord can only do this if you left your tenancy early. Your landlord may try to withhold some or all of your deposit for a different reason, such as having a noisy party in the property. Your landlord cannot do this. Landlords can only take money for any financial loss they have suffered.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-landlord-ask-for-proof-of-income-in-bc>Can a landlord ask for proof of income in BC?</h2>
<p>Protection of Personal Information It’s reasonable to expect landlords to ask potential tenants for certain types of personal information like proof of income, references or identification. This information should only be used for completing the application process – to verify income or perform a credit check.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-notice-do-you-have-to-give-a-landlord-in-bc>How much notice do you have to give a landlord in BC?</h2>
<p>Month-to-month tenancies: A tenant can leave earlier than the effective date by giving the landlord at least 10 days’ written notice and paying the rent up to and including, the planned move-out date. Where the tenant has already paid a full month’s rent, the landlord must refund the remainder of the rent.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-landlords-ask-for-rent-upfront>Why do landlords ask for rent upfront?</h2>
<p>Landlords seek rent upfront to minimise exposure to non-payment and six months is the minimum tenancy.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-landlord-ask-for-last-months-rent-and-security-deposit>Can a landlord ask for last month’s rent and security deposit?</h2>
<p>Your security deposit is not supposed to be used as last month’s rent. It is now illegal in New York state for landlords to require you to pay last month’s rent in addition to a month’s security deposit when you sign a lease.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-landlord-charge-for-the-last-months-rent>Can a landlord charge for the last month’s rent?</h2>
<p>When a state doesn’t set a limit on deposits, landlords are free to charge as much for a security deposit as they choose, limited only by what potential tenants are willing to put down. In these situations, landlords could collect the last month’s rent in addition to the security deposit.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-last-months-rent-and-security>What’s the difference between last month’s rent and security?</h2>
<p>That money cannot be used to pay for damages caused by the tenant or to clean the apartment after the tenant moves out. If the landlord only requires a deposit of “last month’s rent”, then that landlord has taken away from himself financial flexibility to pay for repairs and services typically required by normal wear and tear.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-pay-last-months-rent-when-you-sign-lease>Do you have to pay last month’s rent when you sign lease?</h2>
<p>Updated: May 27th, 2020. Landlords often require tenants to pay a deposit of some sort at the time the parties sign a lease or rental agreement. Most of the time, the deposit is called a security deposit, but it’s not unusual for landlords to also collect a sum they designate as “last month’s rent.”.</p>
