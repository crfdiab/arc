<p>steamboat<br>
An unsung jack-of-all-trades built America’s first steam-powered boat, envisioning open access to the new nation’s natural resources. While the credit usually goes to inventor Robert Fulton, John Fitch was actually the inventor of America’s first steamboat.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-john-fitch-important>Why is John Fitch important?</h2>
<p>John Fitch (January 21, 1743 – July 2, 1798) was an American inventor, clockmaker, entrepreneur and engineer. He was most famous for operating the first steamboat service in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-robert-fulton-do>What did Robert Fulton do?</h2>

He also designed a system of inland waterways, a submarine, and a steam warship.</p>
<h2 id=how-were-steamboats-built>How were steamboats built?</h2>
<p>The paddlewheels were run by an engine that was powered by steam. Steam to run the engine was made by boilers, which were giant copper tubes with two flues and a firebox. The boiler was filled with water, and the fire was stoked high enough to make steam. First wood, and then coal were used to build the fire.</p>

<p>Compared to other types of craft used at the time, such as flatboats, keelboats, and barges, steamboats greatly reduced both the time and expense of shipping goods to distant markets. For this reason, they were enormously important in the growth and consolidation of the U.S. economy before the Civil War.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-john-fitch-and-what-did-he-invent>Who was John Fitch and what did he invent?</h2>
<p>John Fitch was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1917. He was a descendant of the inventor of the steamboat, John Fitch. Fitch’s stepfather was an executive with the Stutz Motor Company, which introduced him to cars and racing at an early age.</p>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-races-did-john-fitch-win>What kind of races did John Fitch win?</h2>
<p>In the course of a driving career which spanned 18 years, Fitch won such notable sports car races as the Gran Premio de Eva Duarte Perón – Sport, 1953 12 Hours of Sebring, 1955 Mille Miglia (production car class), and the 1955 RAC Tourist Trophy, as well as numerous SCCA National Sports Car Championship races.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-john-fitch-do-at-le-mans>What did John Fitch do at Le Mans?</h2>
<p>John Fitch was behind the pit-lane with Pierre’s wife Denise when they heard the explosion. Fitch went outside to investigate, and came across the injured left by Macklin’s car. He tended to them. He then spotted Levegh’s burned corpse lying on the track, where it lay exposed for too long until a Gendarme covered it with a banner.</p>
