<h2 id=which-direction-is-to-your-right-if-you-are-facing-north>Which direction is to your right if you are facing north?</h2>
<p>When you are facing north, east is on your right and west is on your left. When you are facing south, east is on your left and west is on your right.</p>
<h2 id=are-facing-north-turn-90-degrees-left-turn-180-degrees-right-turn-around-to-reverse-your-direction-turn-45-degrees-left-turn-around-to-reverse-your-direction-in-which-direction-are-you-now-facing>Are facing north turn 90 degrees left turn 180 degrees right turn around to reverse your direction turn 45 degrees left turn around to reverse your direction in which direction are you now facing?</h2>
<p>From a north facing, turning 90° left would result in facing west. While facing west, turning 180° east would result in facing east. Reversing direction would put us back facing west. Turning 45° left will put us halfway between west and south; this is southwest.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-90-degrees-to-the-left-of-north>What is 90 degrees to the left of north?</h2>
<p>The Crossword Solver found 20 answers to the 90 degrees left, when facing north crossword clue….</p>
<table><tr><th>90 degrees left, when facing north</th></tr><tr><td>90 degrees left, when facing north</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUE WEST</td></tr><tr><td>Left when facing east</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NORTH</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-direction-is-90-degrees-east>What direction is 90 degrees east?</h2>
<p>90 degrees left = facing West. 180 degrees right = facing East. reverse = facing West.</p>
<h2 id=is-north-0-degrees-on-a-compass>Is North 0 degrees on a compass?</h2>
<p>Compasses have four cardinal points: north (N), east (E), south (S), and west (W). Some compasses also display 360 marks called degrees that can be used instead of or in addition to the needle which always points north. North indicates 0° (0 degrees). 90 degrees is East, south is 180°, and west is 270°.</p>
<h2 id=at-what-degree-is-east>At what degree is East?</h2>
<p>90 degrees<br>
If 0 degrees is North and 90 degrees is East, then 45 degrees is Northeast. This applies for every adjacent pair of directions, so the midpoint between East (90) and South (180) is Southeast at 135 degrees.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-know-what-direction-i-m-facing>How do I know what direction I m facing?</h2>
<p>Method 1. Stand with your right arm pointing to where the sun rises in the morning (East). Your shadow will face behind you when using this method. With your right arm facing East, you will then be facing North and be able to quickly know what direction North, South, East, and West is.</p>
