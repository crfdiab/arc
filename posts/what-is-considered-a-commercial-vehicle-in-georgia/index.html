<h2 id=what-is-considered-a-commercial-vehicle-in-georgia>What is considered a commercial vehicle in Georgia?</h2>
<p>A: Vehicles with a GVWR of 10,001 lbs. or more used as part of a business (including a non-profit organization) are considered commercial motor vehicles for purposes of most of the safety regulations. Vehicles that carry hazardous materials for a business purpose are considered commercial regardless of GVWR.</p>
<h2 id=what-states-require-trip-permits>What states require trip permits?</h2>
<p>*California, Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona have the additional qualifying criteria for which a trip permit is required: Arizonia: All for hire carriers operating a vehicle with 2 or more axles (regardless of weight). New York, Kentucky, Oregon & New Mexico also require mileage permits.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-commercial-and-apportioned-plates>What’s the difference between commercial and apportioned plates?</h2>
<p>Apportioned plates are the type of plate you receive when you register under the IRP.

<h2 id=can-i-haul-freight-with-a-temp-tag>Can I haul freight with a temp tag?</h2>
<p>Depends on the state BUT if the temp has sates listed [apportioned] you can haul freight. Othe states issue a ‘hunter’s permit’ to be used for hunting a job suposedly w/ a carrier that issues a base plate. Hunter permits are not good fof transporting freight and have no space for apportioned states to be listed.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-carry-a-gun-in-a-commercial-vehicle-in-georgia>Can you carry a gun in a commercial vehicle in Georgia?</h2>

<h2 id=how-do-i-get-apportioned-plates>How do I get apportioned plates?</h2>

<li>Mail renewal and/or supplemental applications to Texas Department of Motor Vehicles, Motor Carrier Division – IRP Renewal, P.O. Box 26440, Austin, TX 78755-0440.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=where-do-you-put-temp-tags>Where do you put temp tags?</h2>
<p>Temporary license plates should be placed where the standard plates should go on your given vehicle. On a related note, many motorcycles are now fastening plates to the vertical position on the bike. This is also improper and you could be cited as well.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-run-a-temp-plate>How do you run a temp plate?</h2>
<p>How to Get Temporary License Plates</p>
<ol>

<h2 id=how-to-legally-drive-a-tractor-on-the-road>How to legally drive a tractor on the road?</h2>
<p>Need something to use as a shunter in 3 yards, has to be able to drive between them (too far for a yard truck), a tractor could do so many other tasks that it would be ideal. I guess I really need to find someone who has a classic restored tractor that is used on the road, see if they have solved the problem. I suspect that there is no solution!</p>

<h2 id=do-you-need-to-re-register-as-an-off-road-tractor>Do you need to re register as an off road tractor?</h2>
<p>One possible explanation is to re register as an ‘Off road tractor’, there seems to be no requirement for an agricultural use for this, as long as I keep withing construction and use regs which is not a problem. I just want to do this legally, within the law.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-coc-to-register-a-tractor>Do You need A CoC to register a tractor?</h2>
<p>To register new category T1, T2 and T3 tractors for the first time, you’ll need to prove it has either: A CoC is only valid if the tractor has been assembled by someone acting under control of the manufacturer.
