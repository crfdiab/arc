<h2 id=what-do-really-dark-clouds-mean>What do really dark clouds mean?</h2>
<p>A: Very dark looking or black clouds are probably those that contain a lot of rain in them and part of a thunderstorm, McRoberts adds. “In general, the severity of a storm is related to cloud height, which is why dark clouds are usually an indicator of bad weather.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-some-clouds-grey-and-others-white>Why are some clouds GREY and others white?</h2>
<p>So why are clouds sometimes grey? Cloud bases are often grey as a result of the same scattering that makes them white. When light is scattered in a cloud it usually is sent back upwards, or out to the sides of the cloud, making the tops and sides of the cloud whiter than the base which receives less light.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-black-clouds-at-night-mean>What does Black clouds at night mean?</h2>
<p>however generally or largely Dark or black clouds are an indication of the availability of sufficient water droplets in the clouds sufficient enough to fall as rain in due time as they grow larger and heavier. Large water droplets fail the Rayleigh criterion for visible light and so no longer scatter them.</p>
<h2 id=is-grey-gray>Is grey gray?</h2>
<p>Between Two Shades: ‘Gray’ and ‘Grey’ Gray and grey are both common spellings of the color between black and white. Gray is more frequent in American English, whereas grey is more common in British English. The color known to fall in the range between black and white can be spelled gray or grey.</p>

<p>It’s pretty well-known that most clouds are white, while rain clouds are usually a darker shade of gray. But why are rain clouds so dark? Let’s start by discussing how clouds form. The air around you is full of water in its gaseous form, called water vapor. When the air near the ground warms, it starts to rise,…</p>

<p>It’s pretty well-known that most clouds are white, while rain clouds are usually a darker shade of gray. But why are rain clouds so dark? Let’s start by discussing how clouds form. The air around you is full of water in its gaseous form, called water vapor. When the air near the ground warms, it starts to rise, taking the water vapor along with it.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-a-rain-cloud-have-less-light>Why does a rain cloud have less light?</h2>
<p>That is, a cloud gets thicker and denser as it gathers more water droplets and ice crystals — the thicker it gets, the more light it scatters, resulting in less light penetrating all the way through it. The particles on the underside of the rain cloud don’t have a lot of light to scatter to your eyes,…</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-a-lot-of-water-in-a-cloud>Why is there a lot of water in a cloud?</h2>
<p>This can be due to either the physical thickness of the cloud or the density of the droplets, or both.</p>
