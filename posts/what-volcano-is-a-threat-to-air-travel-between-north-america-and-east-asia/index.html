<h2 id=what-volcano-is-a-threat-to-air-travel-between-north-america-and-east-asia>What volcano is a threat to air travel between North America and East Asia?</h2>
<p>Pavlof volcano<br>
Two Alaskan volcanoes could threaten air traffic between Asia and North America. Open this photo in gallery: The Pavlof volcano is located close to the end of the Alaska Peninsula and is one of the most active volcanoes in the region.</p>
<h2 id=what-active-volcano-in-the-us-poses-a-significant-threat-to-air-travel-to-east-asia>What active volcano in the US poses a significant threat to air travel to East Asia?</h2>
<p>Kīlauea is ranked as the U.S. volcano with the highest threat score in the very high threat category.</p>
<h2 id=which-among-the-volcano-poses-the-greatest-threat-to-mankind>Which among the volcano poses the greatest threat to mankind?</h2>
<p>A supervolcano must erupt more than 1,000 cubic km (240 cubic miles) of material, compared with 1.2 km3 for Mount St. Helens or 25 km3 for Mount Pinatubo, a large eruption in the Philippines in 1991. Not surprisingly, supervolcanoes are the most dangerous type of volcano.</p>
<h2 id=which-volcano-in-the-us-is-most-likely-to-erupt>Which volcano in the US is most likely to erupt?</h2>
<p>Kilauea (Hawaii) Kilauea is the most active of the five volcanoes that form the Big Island of Hawaii. Located on the southeastern part of the island, the shield volcano has erupted 34 times since 1952. The most recent eruption lasted almost three decades, from 1983 to 2018.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-usvolcanoes-pose-a-threat>Which is u.s.volcanoes pose a threat?</h2>
<p>As part of its program of keeping officials and the public apprised of volcanic threats, the USGS periodically reassesses the threat level of U.S. volcanoes and updates volcanic threat assessment documentation.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-most-active-volcanoes-in-alaska>Where are the most active volcanoes in Alaska?</h2>
<p>The ash plume is currently too low to impact commercial airliners that fly between North America and Asia at altitudes generally above 30,000 feet. Cleveland, located on Chuginadak Island in the Aleutian Islands, is also one of Alaska’s most persistently active volcanoes.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-kilauea-volcano-a-high-threat-volcano>Is the Kilauea Volcano a high threat volcano?</h2>
<p>The eruptive activity in 2018 and the destruction of residential subdivisions on its flanks are clear examples of why Kīlauea is a very high threat volcano.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-volcanoes-rated-in-the-united-states>How are Volcanoes rated in the United States?</h2>
<p>USGS scored the hazard and exposure factors for each volcano. Based upon the scores, the volcanoes were grouped into one of five threat categories: very low, low, moderate, high and very high. Lava fountains from Fissure 20 cover residential neighborhoods and farmland in Kīlauea Volcano’s lower East Rift Zone (Hawaii).</p>
