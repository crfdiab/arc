<h2 id=when-were-cfcs-phased-out>When were CFCs phased out?</h2>
<p>By 1987, just two years after the hole was discovered, an international treaty was in place that cut the use of CFCs in half. Three years later in 1990, the Montreal Protocol was strengthened to ban the use of CFCs altogether in industrialised countries by the year 2000 and by the year 2010 in developing countries.</p>
<h2 id=are-cfcs-phased-out>Are CFCs phased out?</h2>
<p>Class I substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons, have a higher ozone depletion potential and have been phased out in the U.S.; with a few exceptions, this means no one can produce or import class I substances. New production and import of most HCFCs were phased out as of 2020.</p>
<h2 id=does-ozone-protect-us>Does ozone protect us?</h2>
<p>The ozone layer acts as an invisible shield and protects us from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. In particular, the ozone layer protects us from the UV radiation, known as UV-B, which causes sunburn.</p>
<h2 id=do-we-still-use-cfcs-today>Do we still use CFCs today?</h2>
<p>Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants were commonly used in equipment manufactured before 1995. The atmospherically benign HFC refrigerants will remain in production, but CFC and HCFC refrigerants will be phased out. Production of CFCs ceased in 1995. HCFC production will cease in 2020 (HCFC-22) or 2030 (HCFC-123).</p>
<h2 id=why-are-chlorofluorocarbons-being-phased-out-of-the-atmosphere>Why are chlorofluorocarbons being phased out of the atmosphere?</h2>
<p>Chlorofluorocarbon. Because CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, and they are being replaced with other products such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) (e.g., R-410A) and R-134a.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-chlorofluorocarbons-banned-in-the-world>Why are chlorofluorocarbons banned in the world?</h2>
<p>Why were CFCs banned? Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are a group of odourless manufactured chemicals. Because they damage the earth’s ozone layer, CFCs have been banned since 1996. Depletion of the Ozone Layer will have a negative impact on the biodiversity of the earth itself.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-they-phase-out-the-use-of-cfcs>When did they phase out the use of CFCs?</h2>
<p>It was first seen over Antarctica. In 1987, a group of 24 nations met together in Montreal, Canada. They all agreed on a protocol to reduce the use of substances depleting the ozone layer. They agreed to phase out the use of CFCs and other chemicals by 1995.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-chlorofluorocarbons-used-in-the-manufacture-of-plastics>How are chlorofluorocarbons used in the manufacture of plastics?</h2>
<p>Chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs used to be used in the manufacture of a range of plastic insulants, including polyurethanes, phenolics, polyisocyanurates and extruded polystyrenes. CFCs are the main cause of the hole in the ozone layer.</p>
