<h2 id=what-is-the-significance-of-the-geographic-location-and-archipelagic-nature-of-the-philippines>What is the significance of the geographic location and archipelagic nature of the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Its islands are classified into three main geographical areas – Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Because of its archipelagic nature, Philippines is a culturally diverse country. With its topography consisting of mountainous terrains, dense forests, plains, and coastal areas, the Philippines is rich in biodiversity.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-geographical-location-of-the-philippines-affect-its-weather-and-climate>How does the geographical location of the Philippines affect its weather and climate?</h2>
<p>This is thanks, in part, to its geography. The Philippines is located in the western Pacific Ocean, surrounded by naturally warm waters that will likely get even warmer as average sea-surface temperatures continue to rise. The ocean then releases some of its heat into the atmosphere, creating wind and rain clouds.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-geographical-features-of-the-philippines-important>Why are the geographical features of the Philippines important?</h2>
<p>1. To learn the location of the major geographical features of the Philippines. 2. To understand how geographical features may (or may not) affect the location of cultures. 3. To understand what a monsoon is, and how it affects the environment of this important Southeast Asian country. 1.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-language-barrier-in-the-philippines>How is the language barrier in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>This helps with the language barrier in the Philippines by at least making it a bit easier to read signs if you can read English. It is also phonetic, meaning you pronounce every individual letter similar with english and some Spanish.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-problems-does-the-philippines-have>What kind of problems does the Philippines have?</h2>
<p>In addition, the Philippines, like many other tropical island nations, has problems with deforestation, and soil and water pollution. The Philippines also has problems with air pollution because of large populations in its urban centers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-spain-affect-the-history-of-the-philippines>How did Spain affect the history of the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Ultimately it was Spain that knitted together many of the Philippine ethnic groups under 333 years of colonial rule. While the old sultanates of Mindanao fiercely resisted Spanish incursions, the Christianized, Hispanicized natives of Luzon and the Visayas began to develop a national identity of their own.</p>
