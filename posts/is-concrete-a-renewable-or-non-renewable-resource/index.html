<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-non-renewable-energy>What are the advantages and disadvantages of non-renewable energy?</h2>
<p>Advantages of non-renewable energy. The non-renewable source of energy is affordable. For instance diesel and oil. It is easily accessible and more compatible. The non-renewable source of energy is easy to store. Disadvantages of non-renewable energy. Non-renewable energy cannot be replaced once their energy source is used up.</p>
