<p>Faced with sickness, disease, malnutrition and retaliatory attacks by the Indians, the colony was brought to the brink of extinction.</p>
<h2 id=what-hardships-were-faced-by-the-jamestown-colonists>What hardships were faced by the Jamestown colonists?</h2>
<p>Fire, disease, famine and Indian attacks remained, but according to Leccese, “One other important problem was the increasingly stratified society. As time went on, original settlers had snatched up all the quality land and new settlers were finding less opportunity to become independent farmers on their own land.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-challenges-did-the-jamestown-settlers-face>What kind of challenges did the Jamestown settlers face?</h2>
<p>1607: A Nation Takes Root. Jamestown Settlement Challenges continued to plague the settlers. In early January 1608, shortly after Captain Newport’s return, a devastating fire destroyed much of the fort, including the colonists’ dwellings and provisions.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-settlers-face-in-the-colonial-period>What did the settlers face in the colonial period?</h2>

<h2 id=what-did-the-colonist-face-in-the-bermuda-colony>What did the colonist face in the Bermuda colony?</h2>
<p>Faced with sickness, disease, malnutrition and retaliatory attacks by the Indians, the colony was brought to the brink of extinction. In May 1610, Sir Thomas Gates belatedly arrived with more than 100 survivors from Bermuda. He found the fort in ruins and remaining 60 colonists there “famished at the point of death.”</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-the-colonist-in-the-carolinas>What was life like for the colonist in the Carolinas?</h2>
<p>Many, especially in the Chesapeake and the Carolinas, experienced diseases, including malaria and fevers. These diseases were so brutal that colonists referred to the first months of a colonist’s life in the colonies as a “seasoning” period that many did not survive.</p>
