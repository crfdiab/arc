<h2 id=what-language-is-the-earliest-foreign-influence-to-come-to-japan>What language is the earliest foreign influence to come to Japan?</h2>
<p>Chinese and Korean were the two earliest foreign languages to be studied in Japan. Written Chinese characters were introduced to Japan through the Korean Peninsula around the fifth and sixth centuries. Since then, Japan has continued to make use of and adapt Chinese writing and the culture of China to its own purposes.</p>
<h2 id=what-cultures-influenced-early-japan>What cultures influenced early Japan?</h2>
<p>During its classical period, Japan was highly influenced by Chinese culture. The influence of Buddhism, Confucianism, and other elements of Chinese culture had a profound impact on the development of Japanese culture.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-foreign-influence-impact-japan>How did foreign influence impact Japan?</h2>
<p>The foreign nations not only had direct influence in opening Japanese ports, but also instilled fear on the Japanese that spurred their modernization. During the Edo period, Japan was unified under the Tokugawa bakufu and its desire to preserve its sovereignty after years of civil wars during the Sengoku period.</p>
<h2 id=which-countries-strongly-influenced-early-japan>Which countries strongly influenced early Japan?</h2>
<p>For Japan, the cultures that most influenced it were those of China and Korea. Japan is an island off the coasts of China and Korea, meaning that these two civilizations were the link connecting Japan to the rest of mainland Asia.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-japan-preserve-their-culture>How did Japan preserve their culture?</h2>
<p>While Japanese lifestyle has been Westernized recently, Japanese people still do everything possible to preserve their rich cultural heritage by practicing tea ceremony, wearing kimono and studying traditional arts and crafts from early childhood.</p>
<h2 id=how-traditional-is-japan>How traditional is Japan?</h2>
<p>Deeply rooted in Japan’s unique Shinto religion and traditional agrarian lifestyle, Japan is a country with a vibrant “matsuri” culture. Matsuri is the Japanese word for festival. These festivals often feature grand processions, festival markets and other local celebration activities.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-foreign-influence-affect-the-development-of-japan>How did foreign influence affect the development of Japan?</h2>
<h2 id=what-was-the-turning-point-in-japanese-history>What was the turning point in Japanese history?</h2>
<p>The Meiji Restoration of 1868 is known as one of the great turning points in Japanese history. An event unique to Japan, it was the Meiji Restoration that set Japan apart developmentally from its Asian neighbors.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-foreign-nations-try-to-open-japans-ports>Why did foreign nations try to open Japan’s ports?</h2>
<p>Though foreign nations approached Japan in an attempt to open its ports for various trade and naval purposes, these pressures had other implications for the Japanese. The foreign nations not only had direct influence in opening Japanese ports, but also instilled fear on the Japanese that spurred their modernization.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-japan-catch-up-to-other-nations>How did Japan catch up to other nations?</h2>
<p>While other Eastern nations fell further behind Western powers in the changing world, Japan strode forward, maintaining its sovereignty and quickly catching up to the other major foreign powers. Over the years, historians have studied and analyzed the complexities of these years and their implications repeatedly.</p>
