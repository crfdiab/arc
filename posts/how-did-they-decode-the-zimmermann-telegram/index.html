<h2 id=how-did-they-decode-the-zimmermann-telegram>How did they decode the Zimmermann telegram?</h2>
<p>Each letter in the grid is replaced by two letters in the coded message. The first letter in the message is from the vertical axis and the second letter is from the horizontal axis. To decode the “Zimmermann Note”, begin by grouping each set of two letters and continue this through the entire message.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-british-get-their-hands-on-the-original-coded-telegram>How did the British get their hands on the original coded telegram?</h2>
<p>William Reginald Hall, who headed up Britain’s Room 40 code-breakers. In order to conceal the original source of the document, the British foreign office got its hands on a second copy of the Zimmermann Telegram from when it had been transmitted between Washington, D.C. and Mexico City.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-britain-do-with-the-zimmermann-telegram>What did Britain do with the Zimmermann telegram?</h2>
<p>In response to the breaking of the Sussex pledge, the United States severed diplomatic relations with Germany. Several weeks later, on February 24, the British presented the Zimmermann telegram to the U.S. Government in an effort to capitalize on growing anti-German sentiment in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-pass-on-the-zimmerman-note>Why did the British pass on the Zimmerman note?</h2>
<p>Dilemma for British Naval Intelligence Whilst the British authorities wanted to pass this information to the Americans, to do so would reveal that communications were being intercepted. The Americans would not appreciate the thought that their signals might also be collected.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-zimmermann-telegram-say-exactly>What did the Zimmermann telegram say exactly?</h2>
<p>The telegram instructed Eckardt that if the United States appeared certain to enter the war, he was to approach the Mexican government with a proposal for military alliance with funding from Germany. The decoded telegram was follows: We intend to begin on the first of February unrestricted submarine warfare.</p>
<h2 id=what-if-the-zimmerman-telegram-was-never-sent>What if the Zimmerman telegram was never sent?</h2>
<p>What if the Zimmerman Telegram had never been intercepted and exposed? The telegram itself had little effect on the course of the war. Mexico ignored the telegram when they received it as they had no interest in starting a formal war with the United States.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-zimmerman-telegram-push-the-united-states-toward-war>Why did the Zimmerman telegram push the United States toward war?</h2>
<p>Zimmermann sent the telegram in anticipation of resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare, an act the German government expected would likely lead to war with the U.S. Zimmermann hoped tensions with Mexico would slow shipments of supplies, munitions, and troops to the Allies if the U.S. was tied down on its southern …</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-message-in-the-second-zimmermann-telegram>What was the message in the second Zimmermann Telegram?</h2>
<p>When the second telegram arrived, it bore news that would play a role in changing the course of the next 100 years: the ambassador was telling the U.S. that he had received from the British the decoded text of a message they had intercepted from the Foreign Minister of Germany, Arthur Zimmermann, to his country’s minister to Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-telegram-sent-from-berlin-to-washington>When was the telegram sent from Berlin to Washington?</h2>
<p>However, the Germans underestimated the British codebreakers. The telegram was first sent from Berlin to Washington on January 16 (using the U.S. diplomatic lines), intercepted by the British, and was partially decrypted by the people in Room 40. Even with an incomplete message, the intentions of Germany were evident.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-britain-translate-the-german-message-into-english>Why did Britain translate the German message into English?</h2>
<p>So, Britain has the German message in her sweaty hands and has translated it using German codes which they have broken years before and that the Germans haven’t changed since the start of the war because the Germans are far too clever for the Allies and the Allies would never be smart enough to crack that…</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-older-code-0075-or-13040>Which is the older code 0075 or 13040?</h2>
<p>An older code, named 13040, was already been cracked by the British, but the newer code 0075 was considered secure. Code 13040 had about 25,000 plaintext elements and 75,000 code numbers. For instance, here are some examples from the codebook: However, the Germans underestimated the British codebreakers.</p>
