<h2 id=is-phoenix-stronger-than-vampire>Is Phoenix stronger than vampire?</h2>
<p>A mature Phoenix would be far more successful in battle against a Vampire, and could prove to be a worthy opponent, though this would vary depending on the individuals involved.</p>
<h2 id=are-phoenixes-better-than-dragons>Are phoenixes better than dragons?</h2>
<p>Originally Answered: Who is stronger Phoenix or Dragon? Dragon is Stronger. As we know Marco The Phoenix was defeated by The Blackbeard (Marshall D Teach) and we all know that it is assumed that Dragon is way more stronger than Blackbeard.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-phoenix-die>Can a Phoenix die?</h2>
<p>Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor. Some legends say it dies in a show of flames and combustion, others that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-phoenix-in-vampire-diaries>What is a Phoenix in Vampire Diaries?</h2>
<p>The Phoenix is a rare supernatural creature and revives from the ashes when killed.</p>
<h2 id=who-can-beat-phoenix>Who can beat Phoenix?</h2>
<ul>
<li>8 Thanos (With The Infinity Gauntlet)</li>
<li>9 Death.</li>
<li>10 Iron Man.</li>
<li>11 Doctor Strange.</li>
<li>12 Thor.</li>
<li>13 Nebula (With Infinity Gauntlet)</li>
<li>14 Molecule Man.</li>
<li>15 Galactus. The Devourer of Worlds has actually fought against the Phoenix, in Excalibur #61 from 1993.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=who-can-beat-deadpool>Who can beat Deadpool?</h2>
<p>Actually, considering how often Deadpool plays around, any competent hand to hand fighter can kill Deadpool (if only for seconds). From HULK to Squirrel Girl, many people have beaten Wilson’s ass and since he has regular bones and muscles, anyone who has beaten Wade can potentially kill him.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-kill-a-dragon>What can kill a dragon?</h2>
<p>The first thing you have to consider when slaying a dragon is whether you are endowed with superhuman strength. If so, then almost any weapon will do. There are stories of dragonslayers using an axe or even a club to dispatch the fiery beasts, but a knight will typically use a sword.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-phoenixs-enemy>What is the Phoenix’s enemy?</h2>
<p>They have no real natural enemy, save the occasional basilisk that catches them in time, or the roc who attacks and they both die. One reason the bird is associated with the fire service and used on many badges is because of the fact that it has been fabled to be consumed by fire, only to rise again from its ashes.</p>
<h2 id=what-powers-does-a-human-phoenix-have>What powers does a human phoenix have?</h2>
<p>The phoenix was a powerful being that appeared human. It possessed the ability to incinerate things through touch and was immune to conventional methods of killing; though the phoenix could technically “die”, it would resurrect soon after being killed. Upon death the phoenix would combust and form a pile of ashes.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-phoenix-exist>Does the Phoenix exist?</h2>
<p>phoenix, in ancient Egypt and in Classical antiquity, a fabulous bird associated with the worship of the sun. Only one phoenix existed at any time, and it was very long-lived—no ancient authority gave it a life span of less than 500 years.</p>
<h2 id=does-stefan-have-a-child>Does Stefan have a child?</h2>
<p>Stefan Salvatore and Valerie Tulle’s Unborn Child was a fetus that was first mentioned in Age of Innocence. This child was killed by Julian in 1863. In Stefan’s dream, he was an eleven year old boy named Jacob who was, seemingly, human.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-phoenix-stone-bad>Why is the Phoenix Stone bad?</h2>
<p>The stone was part of The Phoenix Sword created as a supernatural prison to trap and house vampire souls. After Mary Louise and Nora Hildegard destroyed the stone, all vampires that were trapped inside the stone are now free and are possessing corpses of recently deceased.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-vampire-witch-faster-than-a-human>What makes a vampire witch faster than a human?</h2>
<p>Vampire-Witch Hybrids can accelerate their movements to cover short distances in an instant, faster than the human eye can see. When running across long distances, they appear as vibrating blurs of motion. Their reflexes are similarly heightened. Like their strength, their speed increases with age.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-supernatural-powers-that-vampires-have>Are there any supernatural powers that vampires have?</h2>
<p>As I scanned through them I couldn’t help but notice that many of the powers listed were powers that quite a few vampires in fiction have, but better yet, there was a whole handful of abilities that no vampire I have ever read about have, powers that could make for a very interesting “new” vampire.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-real-vampires-that-drink-your-blood>Are there real vampires that Drink Your Blood?</h2>
<p>Belfazaar and all the other self-described vampires 20/20 spoke to for this story preferred not to be identified by their real names. In fiction, when vampires feed they kill. However, in the strange world of so-called real vampires, there is an etiquette to drinking blood.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-vampire-witch-hybrids-in-the-world>Are there any vampire-witch hybrids in the world?</h2>
<p>Vampire-Witch Hybrids are an extremely rare species, with only three known classification of hybrids in existence. As they possess the vampiric and wiccan gene, vampire-witch hybrids have an immunity to what normal vampires have weaknesses towards.</p>
