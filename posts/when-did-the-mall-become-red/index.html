<h2 id=when-did-the-mall-become-red>When did The Mall become red?</h2>
<p>1954<br>
It was David Eccles’s decision, as Minister of Works from 1951 to 1954, to make The Mall red.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-mall-in-london-called-the-mall>Why is The Mall in London called The Mall?</h2>
<p>The word ‘mall’ comes from a 16th-century Italian alley game that resembled croquet. It was called pallamaglio, or pall-mall in English; the alley on which the game was played came to be known as a ‘mall’.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-pall-mall-called-pall-mall>Why is pall-mall called pall-mall?</h2>
<p>The street’s name is derived from pall-mall, a ball game played there during the 17th century. The area was built up during the reign of Charles II with fashionable London residences. It became known for high-class shopping in the 18th century, and gentlemen’s clubs in the 19th.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-building-at-the-end-of-the-mall>What is the building at the end of The Mall?</h2>
<p>Admiralty Arch<br>
Commissioned by King Edward VII to commemorate Queen Victoria’s death, and designed by Sir Aston Webb and completed in 1912, Admiralty Arch stands majestically at the North east end of The Mall.</p>
<h2 id=can-the-mall-be-used-as-a-runway>Can the mall be used as a runway?</h2>
<p>THE Mall would not be a suitable landing strip because of its length, its lamp posts, and adjoining high buildings. However, Peter Laurie, in his book Beneath The City Streets (Allen Lane, 1970, pages 173-174), claimed that the Broad Walk, in Kensington Gardens, could be used for this purpose.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-game-of-pall-mall>What is a game of Pall Mall?</h2>
<p>a game wherein a round bowle is with a mallet struck through a high arch of iron (standing at either end of an alley) which he that can do at the fewest blows, or at the number agreed on, wins. This game was heretofore used in the long alley near St. James’s and vulgarly called Pell-Mell.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-anno-decimo-mean>What does Anno decimo mean?</h2>
<p>On the Arch are engraved the Latin words “ANNO DECIMO EDWARDI SEPTIMI REGIS VICTORIAE REGINAE CIVIS GRATISSIMI MDCCCCX” which translates as “In the tenth year of the reign of King Edward VII, to Queen Victoria from a grateful nation, 1910.”</p>
<h2 id=does-anyone-live-in-admiralty-arch>Does anyone live in Admiralty Arch?</h2>
<p>Admiralty Arch, commissioned by King Edward VII in memory of his mother, Queen Victoria, and designed by Aston Webb, is now a Grade I listed building….</p>

<h2 id=when-was-trafalgar-square-built-for-the-royal-family>When was Trafalgar Square built for the royal family?</h2>
<p>) It was constructed in the 1840s From the 14th to the late 17th century, much of the area occupied by Trafalgar Square was the on the site that was originally the Royal Mews where royal hawks were kept during moulting (or ‘mew’ time). In the 1730s, the area was used for Royal stables, which served Whitehall Palace.</p>
