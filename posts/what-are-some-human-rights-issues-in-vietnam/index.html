<h2 id=what-are-some-human-rights-issues-in-vietnam>What are some human rights issues in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Significant human rights issues included: unlawful or arbitrary killings by the government; torture by government agents; arbitrary arrests and detentions by the government; political prisoners; significant problems with the independence of the judiciary; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; serious …</p>
<h2 id=does-vietnam-have-free-speech>Does Vietnam have free speech?</h2>
<p>In its 2018 World Press Freedom Index, Reporters Without Borders ranked Vietnam as 175 out of 180 countries. “The citizen shall enjoy the right to freedom of opinion and speech, freedom of the press, of access to information, to assemble, form associations and hold demonstrations.</p>
<h2 id=does-vietnam-support-human-rights>Does Vietnam support human rights?</h2>
<p>Vietnam did little to improve its abysmal human rights record in 2019. The government continues to restrict all basic civil and political rights, including freedom of expression, association, assembly, and the rights to freely practice beliefs and religion.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-problems-in-vietnam>What are some problems in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Here are eight social issues that Vietnam is currently facing:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Aging Population.</li>
<li>Economic Inequality.</li>
<li>Brain Drain.</li>
<li>Get-Rich Mindset.</li>
<li>Public Debt.</li>
<li>Corruption.</li>
<li>Pollution.</li>
<li>Unsafe Food.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=does-vietnam-have-secret-police>Does Vietnam have secret police?</h2>
<p>The People’s Public Security of Vietnam (Vietnamese: Công an Nhân dân Việt Nam) is the main police and security force of Vietnam, under control of the Ministry of Public Security. It is composed of 2 service branches, the Vietnam People’s Security Force and the Vietnam People’s Police Force.</p>
<h2 id=do-police-in-vietnam-carry-guns>Do police in Vietnam carry guns?</h2>
<p>Only authorised firearms officers (AFOs) carry firearms. Their armed response vehicles could be some distance away.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-rights-of-people-in-vietnam>What are the rights of people in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Basic rights, including freedom of speech, opinion, press, association, and religion, are restricted. Rights activists and bloggers face harassment, intimidation, physical assault, and imprisonment. Farmers continue to lose land to development projects without adequate compensation, and workers are not allowed to form independent unions.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-human-rights-record-in-vietnam>What was the human rights record in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>In its 2004 report on Human Rights Practices, the U.S. State Department characterized Vietnam’s human rights record as “poor” and cited the continuation of “serious abuses.” According to the report, the government has imposed restrictions on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and freedom of association .</p>
<h2 id=what-do-people-love-about-living-in-vietnam>What do people love about living in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Once you tell them it’s because you love living here, they fill with pride. They love having foreigners here because it’s just another sign that their country has turned the corner. We love any excuse to stay home and curl up with a book, and nothing makes us feel better about being unproductive than a torrential downpour. It’s the perfect excuse.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-vietnams-national-human-rights-day>When is Vietnam’s national Human Rights Day?</h2>
<p>Other human rights issues concern freedom of association, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press . Since 1994, Vietnam Human Rights Day is celebrated each year on 11 May.
