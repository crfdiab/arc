<p>INTRODUCTION  Pathological museums are in part historical, representing the pioneer work of diagnosticians and therapists.  Presenting records of past states not now encountered, or conditions of great rarity; and finally they provide the student with the basic material of his/her current teaching.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-museum-techniques>What are museum techniques?</h2>
<p>Fixation arrests autolysis and bacterial decomposition and stabilizes the cellular and tissue constituents. The fixatives used in museums all over the world are based on formalin fixative technique, and are derived from Kaiserling technique and his modifications.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-museum-specimens-prepared>How are museum specimens prepared?</h2>
<p> It involves removing the specimen, washing it in running water and transferring to 95% alcohol for 10 minutes to 1hour depending on the size of specimen.  The specimen is then kept and observed for color change for around 1- 1.5 hrs. After this step, specimen is ready for preservation.</p>
<h2 id=which-solution-is-used-for-mounting-of-museum-specimens>Which solution is used for mounting of museum specimens?</h2>
<p>Kaiserling’s technique advocates the use of a solution of formalin, water, potassium nitrate, and potassium acetate for fixation, the immersion in ethyl alcohol to restore color and preservation in a solution of glycerin, aqueous arsenious acid, water, potassium acetate and thymol.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-tissue-processing>What is tissue processing?</h2>
<p>Tissue processing is a procedure of removing water from cells and replacing it with a medium which solidifies allowing thin sections to be cut on a microtome.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-purpose-of-a-museum>What is the main purpose of a museum?</h2>
<p>The current definition, agreed in 2007, states: ‘A museum is a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-museum-specimen>What is museum specimen?</h2>
<p>n a place or building where objects of historical, artistic, or scientific interest are exhibited, preserved, or studied.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-mounting-of-specimen>What is mounting of specimen?</h2>
<p>About Mounting The purpose of mounting is to protect fragile or coated materials during preparation and to obtain perfect edge retention. Mounting is used when the protection of layers is imperative, and also it enables a safer and more convenient handling of small, sharp, or irregularly shaped specimens, for example.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-museum-explain-with-example>What are the different types of museum explain with example?</h2>
<p>In this article, museums are classified into five basic types—general, natural history and natural science, science and technology, history, and art. A more recent kind of museum—the virtual museum—transcends all other types by virtue of its unique electronic presentation and is discussed as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-steps-in-tissue-processing>What are the steps in tissue processing?</h2>
<p>Overview of the steps in tissue processing for paraffin sections</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtaining a fresh specimen. Fresh tissue specimens will come from various sources.</li>
<li>Fixation. The specimen is placed in a liquid fixing agent (fixative) such as formaldehyde solution (formalin).</li>
<li>Dehydration.</li>
<li>Clearing.</li>
<li>Wax infiltration.</li>
<li>Embedding or blocking out.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-good-specimen-for-a-museum>What makes a good specimen for a museum?</h2>
<p>Well-preserved specimens—both micro­scopic and macroscopic—are assets of a good museum. i. Microscopic animals: Stained, permanent slides are prepared and preserved with proper labeling. ii. Macroscopic animals: Soft-bodied animals are preserved for a long time in 70% alcohol or glyceroalcohol.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-preserve-a-specimen-for-sclentific-study>How to preserve a specimen for sclentific study?</h2>
<p>Steps for the preservation of specimens for sclentific study are as follows: 1 Euthanizing. Specimens should be euthanized in a way that will leave them undamaged and relaxed, and follows best practices set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). 2 Injection and slitting. 3 Fixing. 4 Labeling. 5 Storage. …</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-preserve-a-specimen>What’s the best way to preserve a specimen?</h2>
<p>The glass plate with tied specimen is placed in the gas jar and formalin solution is poured slowly in it till the specimen is submerged in the solution. The gas jar is closed with a lid or cap and the joining is sealed with molten paraffin to prevent evapo­ration. The specimen in the jar will remain in good condition for long years.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-specimens-last-in-a-museum>How long do specimens last in a museum?</h2>
<p>Regd. No. The labeled specimen is put in museum rack along with the specimens of the same or nearest group. Properly preserved specimens remain as such for many years. Replacement or addition of preservative should be done when­ever necessary.</p>
