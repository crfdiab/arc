<p>of Cong<br>
The village of Cong, straddling counties Mayo and Galway in the west of Ireland, is the most famous Quiet Man filming location as it represents the majority of the fictional Inisfree in the film.</p>

<p>Ireland<br>
In 1951 John Ford’s greatest movie “The Quiet Man” starring John Wayne, Maureen O’Hara and Barry Fitzgerald was made. It was set in the beautiful west of Ireland with filming being centred in the village of Cong on the Mayo-Galway border.</p>

<p>Cong<br>
On May 19 we went to Cong, Ireland, where legendary director John Ford shot “The Quiet Man.” It is a quiet, picturesque village with stone fences and bridges, babbling brooks and nearby fields that look much the same as they did in 1951 when the movie was made.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-mary-kate-say-in-irish-in-the-quiet-man>What does Mary Kate say in Irish in The Quiet Man?</h2>
<p>For those who aren’t fluent in “the Irish” and who might have wondered all these years what Mary Kate was saying, here’s the translation: “I didn’t allow my husband into bed with me last night. I forced him to sleep in–oh, in a bag for sleeping! A bag for sleeping …</p>

<p>The white-haired, frail Dan Tobin, who gets up from his death bed and runs to see the fight, is John Ford’s older brother, Francis Ford. Francis was a silent-film actor and director in his own right, who died two years after the film was made.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-town-in-the-quiet-man-real>Is the town in the quiet man real?</h2>
<p>IT’S ONE of the best-loved films ever to come out of the Emerald Isle, thanks in no small part to idyllic landscape featured within. While the movie is set in the village of Inishfree, the real-life location is the quaint village of Cong in County Mayo.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-john-waynes-proper-name>What was John Wayne’s proper name?</h2>
<p>Marion Michael Morrison<br>
John Wayne, byname Duke, original name Marion Michael Morrison (see Researcher’s Note) , (born May 26, 1907, Winterset, Iowa, U.S.—died June 11, 1979, Los Angeles, California), major American motion-picture actor who embodied the image of the strong, taciturn cowboy or soldier and who in many ways personified the …</p>

<p>“The Quiet Man,” John Ford’s 1952 movie starring John Wayne, Maureen O’Hara and Barry Fitzgerald (to name but a few), was set in the village of Cong. Now, with its bronze statue of Mary Kate Danaher and John Thornton, to its Quiet Man Cottage Museum, to its guided tours, the classic movie continues to bring visitors into town.</p>

<p>Now, with its bronze statue of Mary Kate Danaher and John Thornton, to its Quiet Man Cottage Museum, to its guided tours, the classic movie continues to bring visitors into town. Very little has changed, on the outside, in this picturesque town and the locals are happy to revel in the old movie’s popularity.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-white-o-mornin-cottage-in-quiet-man>Where is white O Mornin cottage in Quiet Man?</h2>
<p>Located by the river at Circular Road, Cong, between actual locations used for the filming, the ground floor of the cottage has been designed as an exact replica of ‘White-o-Mornin’ Cottage. Painstaking effort has ensured that all the furnishings, artifacts, costumes etc are authentic reproductions.</p>
