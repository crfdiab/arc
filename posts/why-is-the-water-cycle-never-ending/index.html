<h2 id=why-is-the-water-cycle-never-ending>Why is the water cycle never ending?</h2>
<p>Water moves from the earth to the air to the earth again meaning we are using the same water that was once used by the dinosaurs. Water moves from clouds to land and back to the oceans in a never ending cycle.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-water-cycle-ever-end-explain>Does the water cycle ever end explain?</h2>
<p>There is no start or end to the water cycle, but for explanation purposes we will start at the sun. All water eventually makes it back to the ocean and starts the cycle again. The different stages in this cycle can take from seconds to thousands of years. Most of the water on earth (97%) is stored in the oceans.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-water-cycle-keep-repeating>Why does the water cycle keep repeating?</h2>
<p>The earth’s water constantly recycles itself in a process that is called the water cycle. The water cycle has three main stages, evaporation, condensation, and precipitation, which repeat over and over again endlessly. This process cycles water from the earth, through the air, to the clouds, and back to earth again.</p>
<h2 id=is-water-a-biogeochemical-cycle>Is water a biogeochemical cycle?</h2>
<p>Water and nutrients are constantly being recycled through the environment. This process through which water or a chemical element is continuously recycled in an ecosystem is called a biogeochemical cycle. Three important biogeochemical cycles are the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-quran-say-about-water-cycle>What does Quran say about water cycle?</h2>
<p>Below in Surah Hijr Quran also tells that it is God who is the guardian of stores of water. Just think that we cannot preserve anything even water more than a certain period of time and it would get spoiled but underground water reserves are kept safe and pure despite being hundreds and thousands of years old.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-the-water-cycle-stopped>What would happen if the water cycle stopped?</h2>
<p>What Would Happen If the Water Cycle Stopped? If the water cycle were to stop, lakes, rivers and groundwater sources would dry up, glaciers would disappear and precipitation would stop falling. All freshwater resources would be negatively impacted, and life on Earth would completely cease.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-moisture-released-in-the-water-cycle>How is moisture released in the water cycle?</h2>
<p>Process of Water Cycle Most of the moisture found in our atmosphere is a result of evaporation that occurs from oceans, seas, lakes, etc. Evaporation is a process in which the water changes from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase. Plants also play a role in releasing the moisture through the process of transpiration.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-the-water-cycle-take-on-earth>How long does the water cycle take on Earth?</h2>
<p>Approximate time frame: 2 weeks. Water on earth is used over and over. The water cycle, the continuous movement of water from ocean to air and land then back to the ocean in a cyclic pattern, is a central concept in meteorology. In the water cycle, the sun heats the Earth’s surface water, causing that surface water to evaporate (gas).</p>
