<h2 id=what-happened-in-france-after-revolution>What happened in France after revolution?</h2>
<p>Events that happened in France after the revolution were: Monarchy was abolished and France became a democratic republic. King Louis XVI and queen Marie Antoinette were executed.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-france-controlled-by-before-the-revolution>Who was France controlled by before the revolution?</h2>
<p>The Ancien Régime (/ˌɒ̃sjæ̃ reɪˈʒiːm/; French: [ɑ̃sjɛ̃ ʁeʒim]; literally “old rule”), also known as the Old Regime, was the political and social system of the Kingdom of France from the Late Middle Ages (circa 15th century) until the French Revolution of 1789, which led to the abolition (1792) of hereditary monarchy …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-french-revolution-on-france>What was the impact of the French Revolution on France?</h2>
<p>The Revolution led to the establishment of a democratic government for the first time in Europe. Feudalism as an institution was buried by the Revolution, and the Church and the clergy were brought under State control. It led to the eventual rise of Napoleon Bonaparte as the Emperor of France.</p>
<h2 id=who-ruled-france-after-the-french-revolution>Who ruled France after the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>The head of state after the 1789 revolution was King Louis XVI, the same king that had ruled since 1774. Although he had significantly less power than before, the King wasn’t deposed until 1792. During the Revolutionary period France was ruled by a series of short-lived governments.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-controller-general-during-the-french-revolution>Who was the Controller General during the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>In the fall of 1786, Louis XVI’s controller general, Charles Alexandre de Calonne, proposed a financial reform package that included a universal land tax from which the privileged classes would no longer be exempt.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-bourbon-monarchy-overthrown-in-france>When was the Bourbon monarchy overthrown in France?</h2>
<p>Its reign was disrupted by the French Revolution. Monarchy was abolished in France in 1792 and replaced with the Republican form of Government. Although the Bourbon monarchy was restored after the downfall of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815, it lasted till only 1830 when it was finally overthrown in the July Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-finance-minister-during-the-french-revolution>Who was the finance minister during the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>Faced with a social and political unrest, Louis XVI restored Necker as finance minister but it was too late to stop the French Revolution and subsequently the fall of the French monarchy. The French monarchy reached its height during the 72-year long reign of Louis XIV (r. 1643, officially from 1661 to his death in 1715), also called the Sun King.</p>
