<table><tr><th>Question</th><th>Answer</th></tr><tr><td>The number of individuals of a single species per unit area</td><td>population density</td></tr><tr><td>The movement of individuals into an area is called</td><td>immigration</td></tr><tr><td>The range or area occupied by a population is its</td><td>geographic distribution</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-includes-the-individuals-of-a-single-species-in-an-area>What includes the individuals of a single species in an area?</h2>
<p>A population comprises individuals of the same species. A community however is comprised of different populations of several species coexisting in the same area. In short, a population only refers to one species, but a community refers to all living species within a certain area.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-species-evenness>What is meant by species evenness?</h2>
<p>Species evenness is a measure of the relative abundances of species within a community. Quantitative metrics of species diversity, such as the Shannon Index or Simpson Index, combine both species richness and species evenness to derive a value that characterizes a community.</p>
<h2 id=how-organisms-are-arranged-within-an-area>How organisms are arranged within an area?</h2>
<p>how organisms are arranged within an area; sometimes called population dispersion. the relative number of organisms of each age within a population; also called age distribution. a chart that shows the age distribution of a population; also called age pyramid.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-total-number-of-individuals-the-environment-can-support>What is the total number of individuals the environment can support?</h2>
<p>The number of organisms that an environment can support (its maximum population) is called its carrying capacity.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-number-of-individuals-per-unit-area-called>What is the number of individuals per unit area called?</h2>
<p>The number of individuals of a single species per unit area is known as population density. 2. The movement of individuals into an area is called immigration. 3. The area inhabited by population is known as its geographic distribution. 4. The graph represents</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-limiting-factors-of-a-species>What are the limiting factors of a species?</h2>
<p>The maximum number of individuals of a particular species that a particular environment can support. What factors determine carrying capacity? Limiting factors What limiting factors depend on population density? Density-DEPENENT limiting factors such as: competition, predation, herbivory, parasitism, disease, and stress from overcrowding.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-known-as-population-density-in-biology>Which is known as population density in biology?</h2>
<p>The number of individuals of a single species per unit area is known as population density. 2. The movement of individuals into an area is called immigration. Nice work! You just studied 20 terms! Now up your study game with Learn mode. 1. The number of individuals of a single species per unit area is known as population density. 2.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-populations-studied-in-miller-and-levine-biology>How are populations studied in Miller and Levine biology?</h2>
<p>Miller and Levine Biology – Chapter 5 – Populations Terms in this set (25) How do ecologist study populations? By studying their geographic range, density and distribution, growth rate and age structure. Population density The number of individuals per unit area Geographic Range The area inhabited by a population Growth Rate</p>
