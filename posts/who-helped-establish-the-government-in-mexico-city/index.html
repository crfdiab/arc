<h2 id=what-happened-to-tenochtitlán-in-mexico>What happened to Tenochtitlán in Mexico?</h2>
<p>After a three-month siege, Spanish forces under Hernán Cortés capture Tenochtitlán, the capital of the Aztec empire. Cortés’ men leveled the city and captured Cuauhtémoc, the Aztec emperor. In 1518, he was appointed captain general of a new Spanish expedition to the American mainland.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-tenochtitlan-become-the-capital-of-mexico>When did Tenochtitlan become the capital of Mexico?</h2>
<p>The date 13 March 1325, was chosen in 1925 to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the city. The city was built on an island in what was then Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico. The city was the capital of the expanding Aztec Empire in the 15th century until it was captured by the Spanish in 1521 .</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-battle-of-tenochtitlan>What was the result of the Battle of Tenochtitlan?</h2>
<p>A great deal of Tenochtitlan was destroyed in the fighting, or was looted, burned, or destroyed after the surrender. The leader of the conquistadors, Hernan Cortés, began the construction of what is now known as Mexico City among the ruins. Lake Texcoco was ultimately drained, and much of Mexico City rests in the lake basin.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-cortes-and-his-men-leave-tenochtitlan>When did Cortes and his men leave Tenochtitlan?</h2>
<p>Less than eight months after entering Tenochtitlán as conquerors, Cortés and his men were routed from the city on what the Europeans came to call La Noche Triste (“The Sad Night”; June 30, 1520); they determined to retake it the following year.</p>
