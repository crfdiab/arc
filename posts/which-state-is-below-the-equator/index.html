<h2 id=which-state-is-below-the-equator>Which state is below the equator?</h2>
<p>The U.S. state closest to the equator is Hawaii. At its southernmost tip, the island state has a latitude of just under 19 degrees North latitude….</p>
<h2 id=how-many-degrees-is-texas-from-the-equator>How many degrees is Texas from the equator?</h2>
<p>For example, our office on Galveston Island, Texas, USA, is located at 29 degrees, 16 minutes, and 22 seconds north of the equator, and 94 degrees, 49 minutes and 46 seconds west of the Prime Meridian. The Equator, Prime Meridian, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn are all imaginary lines.</p>
<h2 id=which-hemisphere-is-texas-located-in>Which hemisphere is Texas located in?</h2>
<p>Northern Hemisphere<br>
When it is summer in Texas and other parts of the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.</p>
<h2 id=which-part-of-the-earth-is-below-the-equator>Which part of the Earth is below the equator?</h2>
<p>Southern Hemisphere<br>
The Southern Hemisphere is the half (hemisphere) of Earth that is south of the Equator.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-united-states-above-or-below-the-equator>Is the United States above or below the equator?</h2>
<p>All 50 U.S. states are north of the Equator. The Equator is an imaginary line that divides the globe into northern and southern hemispheres.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-equator-move>Does the equator move?</h2>
<p>Equatorial Shift These occur due to the spinning of the Earth, which creates winds that push ocean waters to the north in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the south in the Southern hemisphere. In other words, the equator moved. The only way for the equator to move is for the spin axis of the Earth — the poles — to move.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-distance-between-texas-and-the-equator>What is the distance between Texas and the equator?</h2>
<p>Distance between Texas and Equator. Distance between Texas and Equator is 12781.87 km. This distance is equal to 7942.29 miles, and 6897.08 nautical miles.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-equator-located-in-the-world>Where is the equator located in the world?</h2>
<p>On earth, this line is approximately 24,901 miles of which only 21.3% lies on land and the rest on the water. The Equator runs through several countries, mainly in Africa and South America. However, Indonesia (Southeast Asia) is straddled the most by the equator.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-miles-of-land-does-the-equator-run-through>How many miles of land does the equator run through?</h2>
<p>On earth, this line is approximately 24,901 miles of which only 21.3% lies on land and the rest on the water. The Equator runs through several countries, mainly in Africa and South America.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-countries-that-pass-over-the-equator>Are there any countries that pass over the equator?</h2>
<p>This list recognizes all countries where the Equator passes over their land; territorial waters of nearby countries are not included. All countries located directly on the Equator are also considered to be in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. or a map and list showing countries in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, go here.</p>
