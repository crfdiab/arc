<h2 id=who-is-the-sun-goddess-of-japan>Who is the Sun goddess of Japan?</h2>
<p>Amaterasu Ōmikami<br>
Amaterasu, in full Amaterasu Ōmikami, (Japanese: “Great Divinity Illuminating Heaven”), the celestial sun goddess from whom the Japanese imperial family claims descent, and an important Shintō deity.</p>
<h2 id=which-goddess-was-known-to-have-birthed-the-great-japanese-islands>Which goddess was known to have birthed the great Japanese islands?</h2>
<p>Amaterasu<br>
Amaterasu, Susanoo, and Tsukuyomi are the children of Izanagi, a deity born of the seven divine generations. Izanagi, along with his sister and wife, Izanami (goddess of creation and death) gave birth to the many islands of Japan and numerous deities of Shintoism.</p>
<h2 id=does-japan-have-a-grim-reaper>Does Japan have a grim reaper?</h2>
<p>Of course, modern Japan is a very secular nation so most people do not literally believe in the existence of Shinigami. That being said, the Japanese love to honor their traditions, so Shinigami are still very much a part of Japanese culture, just as the Grim Reaper is in the Western world.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-goddess-of-the-sun-in-japan>Who was the goddess of the Sun in Japan?</h2>
<p>The sun was mortally offended — with good reason. Civilized progress deadens the impulse to see gods in the workings of nature. It’s a price we pay, willingly or unconsciously. To the ancient Japanese, the sun was the goddess Amaterasu Omikami.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-creator-god-of-japanese-mythology>Who was the creator god of Japanese mythology?</h2>
<p>The Birth of Amaterasu According to Japanese legends, Amaterasu was one of the “Three Precious Children” born to Izanagi, the creator god, after his wife’s death. Izanagi and Izanami had given birth to the first generation of kami, the Shinto spirits often described as gods.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-worship-of-the-sun-goddess-come-from>Where did the worship of the sun goddess come from?</h2>
<p>Sun worship in Japan, scholars tell us, long predates the rise of the Imperial Family. “It was probably fishermen and other seafaring people of Ise to the east of Yamato who originally worshiped the Sun Goddess,” writes Takeshi Matsumae in “The Cambridge History of Japan.”</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-ancient-gods-important-to-japan>Why are the ancient gods important to Japan?</h2>
<p>More importantly, the stories of the ancient gods, or kami, are a crucial part of Shinto, Japan’s indigenous religion, which despite the subsequent adoption of Buddhism and its various sects, is still the basis of uniquely Japanese culture.</p>
