<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-baby-in-raising-arizona>What is the name of the baby in Raising Arizona?</h2>
<p>Southwest-native T.J. Kuhn was only a toddler when he landed the biggest movie role of his life as the kidnapped baby, Nathan Jr. — who gets taken on a crazy cat and mouse mission to evade the police and bounty hunters — in the Coen brother’s hilarious 1987 movie masterpiece, “Raising Arizona.”</p>

<p>Fifteen babies played the Arizona quintuplets in the film. One of the babies was fired during production when he learned to walk.

Writing for The New Yorker, Pauline Kael wrote that ” Raising Arizona is no big deal, but it has a rambunctious charm”.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-coen-brothers-make-raising-arizona>Why did the Coen brothers make Raising Arizona?</h2>
<p>Raising Arizona. The Coen brothers set out to work on the film with the intention of making a film as different from their first feature as possible, with a lighter sense of humor and a faster pace. Raising Arizona received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Some criticized it as too self-conscious, manneristic,…</p>
<h2 id=what-did-david-denby-say-about-raising-arizona>What did David Denby say about Raising Arizona?</h2>
<p>David Denby of New York wrote that the film was a “deranged fable of the New West” which turned “sarcasm into a rude yet affectionate mode of comedy”. Richard Corliss of Time referred to the film as “exuberantly original”.</p>
