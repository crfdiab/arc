<h2 id=what-earthquake-changed-the-course-of-the-mississippi-river>What earthquake changed the course of the Mississippi River?</h2>
<p>On February 7, 1812, the most violent of a series of earthquakes near Missouri causes a so-called fluvial tsunami in the Mississippi River, actually making the river run backward for several hours.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-mississippi-river-run-backwards-after-an-earthquake>Did the Mississippi River run backwards after an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Between December 16, 1811, and late April 1812, a catastrophic series of earthquakes shook the Mississippi Valley. Towns were destroyed, an 18-mile-long lake was created and even the Mississippi River temporarily ran backwards.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-mississippi-river-between-1811-1812>What happened to the Mississippi River between 1811 1812?</h2>
<p>Huge waves on the Mississippi River overwhelmed many boats and washed others high onto the shore. High banks caved and collapsed into the river; sand bars and points of islands gave way; whole islands disappeared. Surface fault rupturing from these earthquakes has not been detected and was not reported, however.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-deepest-part-of-the-monongahela-river>What is the deepest part of the Monongahela river?</h2>
<p>about 20 ft.<br>
It falls 3,831 ft. in elevation from its forks to its mouth on the Ohio River. The mean depth is about 20 ft. In southwestern Pennsylvania, the Monongahela is met by two major tributaries: the Cheat River, which joins at Point Marion, and the Youghiogheny River, which joins at McKeesport.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-only-river-in-the-united-states-that-flows-north>What is the only river in the United States that flows north?</h2>
<p>There are countless examples of rivers flowing northward. Some of the most famous are the world’s longest river the Nile, along with Russia’s Ob, Lena, and Yenisey Rivers. The Red River in the U.S. and Canada and Florida’s St. Johns River also flow north.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-fourth-earthquake-of-the-1811-1812-sequence>Where was the fourth earthquake of the 1811-1812 sequence?</h2>
<p>A large event felt on the East Coast that is sometimes regarded as the fourth principal earthquake of the 1811-1812 sequence. The event is described as “severe” at New Bourbon, Missouri, and was described by boatman John Bradbury, who was moored to a small island south of New Madrid, as “terrible, but not equal to the first”.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-time-the-mississippi-river-reversed-its-flow>When was the first time the Mississippi River reversed its flow?</h2>
<p>The first time the Mississippi reversed its flow was in 1812, when a massive earthquake in the region caused a “fluvial tsunami” in the river, sending the water straight back where it came from.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-earthquake-on-the-mississippi-river-do>What did the earthquake on the Mississippi River do?</h2>
<p>On the Mississippi River itself, the shaking calved the soil along riverbanks and caused trees lining the river to fall into the water. Large waves formed on the water that capsized numerous boats and thrust others onto the land.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-mississippi-river-run-backwards-in-1812>Why did the Mississippi River run backwards in 1812?</h2>
<p>Mississippi River ran backward ??? A “thrust fault” uplift dammed the Mississippi for a few hours early on the morning of Feb. 7, 1812 from about Island #10 north past island #9. Ice breaking up on the Ohio River had just allowed several boats to make it to the region the day before.</p>
