<h2 id=what-part-of-england-did-harold-run>What part of England did Harold run?</h2>
<p>Then Godwin died in 1053, and Harold succeeded him as Earl of Wessex (the southern third of England). This arguably made him the most powerful figure in England after the king. In 1055 Harold drove back the Welsh, who had burned Hereford.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-harold-to-march-north>How long did it take Harold to march north?</h2>
<p>Harold reacted by scraping together a scratch force of his own, made up largely of his own housecarls and his ‘thegns’. He raced north, calling up all the shire levies he could muster on the way. In four days he marched 180 miles – to surprise Hardrada and Tostig, east of York, at Stamford Bridge, on 25 September.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-attacking-harold-in-the-north-of-england>Who was attacking Harold in the North of England?</h2>
<p>Harald Hardrada<br>
On 6th January, one day after Edward’s death, Harold Godwinson was crowned King of England. As news spread of Harold’s coronation, William and prepared to invade England. They both planned to kill King Harold and claim the throne for themselves. Harald Hardrada invaded first from the north of England on 25th September.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-harold-the-first-wait-so-long>Why did Harold the first wait so long?</h2>
<p>The other thing to note is that the longer Harold waited, the more likely he was to gain more support from Englishmen who didn’t want to see their farms put to the torch. Harold could have played a patriotic card, positing himself as a king of England protecting his people from these invaders.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-harold-and-his-family-return-to-england>When did Harold and his family return to England?</h2>
<p>1052 (during) Harold and his family returned to England at the head of an army. King Edward was unable to raise a force that would defeat them and was forced to sue for peace terms. It was agreed that the Godwin family could return and their former lands would be restored to them.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-king-harold-return-to-england-after-the-battle>Why did King Harold return to England after the Battle?</h2>
<p>After the battle William knighted Harold before he returned to England with his nephew Hakon. The Normans claimed that Harold then swore an oath to support William’s claim to the throne of England after the death of Edward. The oath is not recorded in any Anglo-Saxon sources.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-king-harold-go-during-the-godwin-invasion>Where did King Harold go during the Godwin invasion?</h2>
<p>A large number of King Edward’s Norman supporters at court had fled to Normandy in the face of the Godwin invasion. It is likely that Harold’s brother Wulfnoth and his nephew Hakon were taken to Normandy as hostages. Harold’s brother, Sweyn chose not to return to England.</p>
