<h2 id=which-of-the-following-best-describes-the-policy-of-salutary-neglect>Which of the following best describes the policy of salutary neglect?</h2>
<p>The statement that best describes an effect of the British policy of salutary neglect will be that the colonies developed an attitude for self governing. This policy was used by the British Crown in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-salutary-neglect>What was the purpose of salutary neglect?</h2>
<p>Salutary neglect was Britain’s unofficial policy, initiated by prime minister Robert Walpole, to relax the enforcement of strict regulations, particularly trade laws, imposed on the American colonies late in the seventeenth and early in the eighteenth centuries.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-salutary-neglect-have-on-the-english-colonies-in-the-1600s-and-1700s>What impact did salutary neglect have on the English colonies in the 1600’s and 1700’s?</h2>
<p>The British policy of salutary neglect toward the American colonies inadvertently contributed to the American Revolution. This was because during the period of salutary neglect, when the British government wasn’t enforcing its laws in the colonies, the colonists became accustomed to governing themselves.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-salutary-neglect-quizlet>What was salutary neglect quizlet?</h2>
<p>Salutary Neglect is the British policy of letting the colonies ignore most of the British Laws. This policy changed when Britain was broke after the French and Indian war and needed the Colonies to start paying taxes and following their laws.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-often-said-to-have-the-first-great-awakening>Who was often said to have the first Great Awakening?</h2>
<p>One of these groups was the Puritans. A group of radical Puritans who called themselves “Pilgrims” came to the New World to begin a radical new society that revolved around their beliefs.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-salutary-neglect-and-why-is-it-important>What is salutary neglect and why is it important?</h2>
<p>Salutary neglect was an unofficial British policy of non-enforcement of trade regulations on their American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries. The purpose was to maximize economic output amongst the colonists while maintain some form of control.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-british-policy-of-salutary-neglect>What was the British policy of salutary neglect?</h2>
<p>Salutary neglect, policy of the British government from the early to mid-18th century regarding its North American colonies under which trade regulations for the colonies were laxly enforced and imperial supervision of internal colonial affairs was loose as long as the colonies remained loyal to the British government…</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-walpoles-salutary-neglect>What was the cause of Walpole’s salutary neglect?</h2>
<p>Other historians, however, argue that a greater cause of salutary neglect was not deliberate but was instead the incompetence, weakness, and self-interest of poorly qualified colonial officials who were patronage appointees of Walpole.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-salutary-neglect-of-the-stamp-act>What was the salutary neglect of the Stamp Act?</h2>
<p>Salutary neglect. A year later Grenville lowered the boom with the Stamp Act (1765), Parliament’s first attempt to raise revenue through direct taxation of all colonial commercial and legal papers, newspapers, pamphlets, cards, almanacs, and dice, which was greeted with violent opposition in the colonies and was repealed in 1766.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-british-policy-in-the-17th-century>What was the British policy in the 17th century?</h2>
<p>For most of the 17th century the British government had no official policies in place regarding the colonies. The companies, merchants and independent corporations in the colonies governed themselves with very little supervision from British officials.</p>
