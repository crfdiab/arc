<p>The typical Pilgrim home was around 800 square feet and had only one large room where all of the sleeping, eating, cooking, and other activities of everyday life took place. Some homes also had a loft situated in the pitched roof, where the families kept dried herbs and provisions, and maybe a few beds.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-pilgrims-daily-life>What was the pilgrims daily life?</h2>
<p>Pilgrim families lived in houses constructed of bark and branches. The roof was made of straw and vines. Most Pilgrim houses had a fireplace, one main room and a small upstairs space. Surrounding the village was a palisade � a defensive barrier made of logs.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-pilgrims-go-to-school>Did the Pilgrims go to school?</h2>
<p>Pilgrim children spent much of their day working, but sometimes, their parents allowed them to play games that improved their bodies or minds. Children in Plymouth Colony did not go to school, because the Colony did not have a formal school. Many parents, however, taught their children to read and write at home.</p>

<h2 id=when-did-the-pilgrims-travel-to-the-new-world>When did the pilgrims travel to the New World?</h2>

<h2 id=when-did-the-pilgrims-celebrate-their-first-harvest>When did the pilgrims celebrate their first harvest?</h2>
