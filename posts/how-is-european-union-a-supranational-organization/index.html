<h2 id=how-is-european-union-a-supranational-organization>How is European Union a supranational organization?</h2>

<h2 id=how-did-the-european-union-unite>How did the European Union Unite?</h2>
<p>A peaceful Europe – the beginnings of cooperation As of 1950, the European Coal and Steel Community begins to unite European countries economically and politically in order to secure lasting peace. In 1957, the Treaty of Rome creates the European Economic Community (EEC), or ‘Common Market’.</p>

<h2 id=how-can-the-expansion-of-eu-membership-cause-division>How can the expansion of EU membership cause division?</h2>
