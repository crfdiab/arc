<h2 id=can-the-us-and-australia-see-the-moon-at-the-same-time>Can the US and Australia see the Moon at the same time?</h2>
<p>Yes. The Moon, of course, orbits the Earth, which in turn orbits the Sun. The peak of the Full Moon is when the Moon is opposite the Sun – 180 degrees away. Australia’s geographical location means that we often seem to have the New or Full Moon ahead of the rest of the world- but it’s not the case.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-moon-look-different-from-australia>Does the Moon look different from Australia?</h2>
<p>Indeed, the Moon does look ‘upside down’ in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the northern hemisphere. This is simply a matter of orientation.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-moon-look-the-same-all-over-the-world>Does the Moon look the same all over the world?</h2>
<p>Are Moon phases the same everywhere on Earth? Yes, everyone sees the same phases of the Moon. People north and south of the equator do see the Moon’s current phase from different angles, though. Seen from the Northern Hemisphere, the waning crescent appeared on the left side of the Moon.</p>
<h2 id=is-australia-flipped>Is Australia flipped?</h2>
<p>Australia is like tails on a coin with heads up, OK. Australia is located on the downside, making us upside down to the people on the top side of a place coined ‘Earth’.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-moon-upside-down-in-australia>Why is the Moon upside down in Australia?</h2>
<p>Why does the Moon look upside down from Australia? It’s because we’re on a spherical planet. If I stand at the North Pole, with my head “up,” and have a friend stand on the South Pole, with their head “up,” relative to the ground, our two heads are pointed in exactly opposite directions.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-the-full-moon-in-australia>Can you see the full moon in Australia?</h2>
<p>While England is facing towards sun, Australia is facing away from the sun. Since we can only see full moon if we are facing away from the sun, then at that instance, only people in Australia could see the full moon.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-see-the-moon-at-the-same-time>Where can you see the Moon at the same time?</h2>
<p>It’s easy to see that any 2 points you pick can be visible at the same time from this view (although perhaps on the extreme edges of the visible side of the Earth, such as the North and South poles from this view). So, in principle, at least barely, the Moon is potentially visible simultaneously from any two points.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-the-moon-from-florida-or-australia>Can you see the Moon from Florida or Australia?</h2>
<p>From this view, most of the United States is visible, and a portion of Australia is visible. If this is the view from the Moon, people in Florida would be seeing the Moon very low over the Western Horizon, while people along the East Coast of Australia would see the Moon rising low in the East.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-moon-not-visible-in-the-uk>Why is the Moon not visible in the UK?</h2>
<p>Because the Moon is at a distance of around 350,000km and the UK and Australia are not exactly on opposite sides of the Earth. The seasonal tilt has an effect too. Mark any two points on a basketball with a big X.</p>
