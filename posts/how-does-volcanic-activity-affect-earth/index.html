<h2 id=how-does-volcanic-activity-affect-earth>How does volcanic activity affect Earth?</h2>
<p>Volcanoes can impact climate change. During major explosive eruptions huge amounts of volcanic gas, aerosol droplets, and ash are injected into the stratosphere. But volcanic gases like sulfur dioxide can cause global cooling, while volcanic carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, has the potential to promote global warming.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-volcanoes-affect-structures>How do volcanoes affect structures?</h2>
<p>Damage to buildings and building support systems from volcanic ash can range from minor cosmetic damage to building exteriors through to catastrophic structural damage in extreme cases. Damage to buildings may be significantly reduced by taking several key steps before, during, and after ashfall.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-volcanoes-relate-to-the-structure-of-the-earth>How do volcanoes relate to the structure of the Earth?</h2>
<p>A volcano is an opening in Earth’s crust that allows molten rock from beneath the crust to reach the surface. Along with lava, volcanoes also release gases, ash, and rock. It’s a super hot mix that can be both incredibly destructive and creative. Volcanoes form at the edges of Earth’s tectonic plates.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-starting-point-of-volcano>What is the starting point of volcano?</h2>
<p>Deep inside Earth, between the molten iron core and the thin crust at the surface, there is a solid body of rock called the mantle. When rock from the mantle melts, moves to the surface through the crust, and releases pent-up gases, volcanoes erupt.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-volcanoes-affect-the-earths-surface-burning-volcanoes>How do volcanoes affect the earths surface-burning volcanoes?</h2>
<p>A volcano crack! brakes through the earths surface spitting lava and earth everywhere. It begins to build up and make a volcano. by 2 plates converging to make a mountain/volcano where there is a spot where lava can break out. It will warm up the top of the volcano and make mud and ash slides.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-human-activity-have-to-do-with-volcanoes>What does human activity have to do with volcanoes?</h2>
<p>As disasters go, volcanoes have about the least to do with human activity. Basically, volcanoes are the product of plate tectonics, which operates on a scale vastly greater than human impacts on the planet.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-connection-between-solar-activity-volcanic-eruptions-and-earthquakes>Is there a connection between solar activity, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes?</h2>
<p>The Connection Between Solar Activity, Volcanic Eruptions and Earthquakes, Weather and Cycles on Earth The electrical currents from the sun also affect the human body’s magnetic field. The connection between the daily (circadian) and seasonal cycles and geomagnetic activity.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-volcanoes-formed-above-the-magma-chambers>Why are volcanoes formed above the magma chambers?</h2>
<p>Because volcanoes are vents for magma, it makes sense that volcanoes would be formed above underground magma chambers. If you recall, magma is molten rock that has been heated because of high temperatures and pressures beneath the Earth’s crust. This pressure mostly occurs where the tectonic plates meet and subduct.</p>
