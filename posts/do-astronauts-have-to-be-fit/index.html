<p>In other words, astronauts need to stay in shape in order to: mitigate the deterioration of their bones. maintain the strength of their muscles and their heart. remain strong enough to do spacewalks.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-weight-limit-for-astronauts>Is there a weight limit for astronauts?</h2>
<p>Aside from being in excellent health, prospective astronauts must meet the following requirements: — Measure between 149.5 cm and 190.5 cm (4-10 and 6-3), and weigh between 50 and 95 kilograms (110 and 209 pounds). — Have 20/20 vision, or better, in each eye, with or without correction. — Cannot be colour blind.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-do-you-have-to-be-to-be-an-astronaut>How big do you have to be to be an astronaut?</h2>
<p>Aspiring astronauts must be at least 4 feet 10 1/2 inches to be accepted into the program and at least 5 feet 4 to be a shuttle pilot. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration requires that astronauts be able to reach the controls and fit into the space suits.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-you-need-to-be-in-good-shape-to-be-an-astronaut>Why do you need to be in good shape to be an astronaut?</h2>
<p>Also, if there were an emergency, the astronauts would need to be in good shape to get out of the Space Shuttle or Space Station quickly. Once they land on Earth, weakened muscles and bones would make walking difficult. Muscle can be built back up with therapy. But lost bone is not as easy to get back.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-to-become-an-astronaut>What do you need to know to become an astronaut?</h2>
<p>Candidates must learn the basics of the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. They must also learn how to be part of a team by flying the NASA T-38 training jets. Image above: Being selected to be an astronaut candidate is exciting. Credit: NASA Astronauts also take classes. They must learn many things besides science.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-astronauts-have-to-be-so-fit>Why do astronauts have to be so fit?</h2>
<p>“But when I came to JSC, it became really apparent that weight lifting was an important component of being fit as an astronaut.” The purposes of the workout are dual: Astronauts require a level of physical fitness to perform their training. “A significant portion of spacewalk training takes place under water,” says Rubins.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-astronauts-have-to-exercise-in-space>How often do astronauts have to exercise in space?</h2>
<p>Astronauts need to combat this with constant exercise. According to Bob Tweedy, the countermeasures systems instructor at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, astronauts on the Space Station need to put in two and a half hours’ effort each day, six days a week.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-fitness-test-for-an-astronaut>Is there a fitness test for an astronaut?</h2>
<p>There isn’t an astronaut “fitness test” the way there is for people applying to the Army or FBI. As Harrison puts it, “i t’s much more of an individualized thing, because space is such a hostile environment to humans and every body reacts differently to the experience of microgravity.”</p>
