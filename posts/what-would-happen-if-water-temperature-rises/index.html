<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-water-temperature-rises>What would happen if water temperature rises?</h2>
<p>The ocean absorbs most of the excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions, leading to rising ocean temperatures. Increasing ocean temperatures affect marine species and ecosystems. Rising temperatures cause coral bleaching and the loss of breeding grounds for marine fishes and mammals.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-temperature-rises-up>What happens when temperature rises up?</h2>
<p>Heat waves can be dangerous, causing illnesses such as heat cramps and heat stroke, or even death. Warmer temperatures can also lead to a chain reaction of other changes around the world. That’s because increasing air temperature also affects the oceans, weather patterns, snow and ice, and plants and animals.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-water-temperatures-rise-brainly>What would happen if water temperatures rise Brainly?</h2>
<p>A Carbon dioxide could be released, B Oxygen could be released.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-level-of-carbon-dioxide-in-the-ocean-as-temperature-rise>What happens to the level of carbon dioxide in the ocean as temperature rise?</h2>
<p>As temperatures rise, carbon dioxide leaks out of the ocean like a glass of root beer going flat on a warm day. Global warming is expected to reduce the ocean’s ability to absorb CO2, leaving more in the atmosphere…which will lead to even higher temperatures. (Graph by Robert Simmon.)</p>
<h2 id=what-will-happen-to-the-molecules-of-water-if-the-temperature-decreases-brainly>What will happen to the molecules of water if the temperature decreases Brainly?</h2>
<p>Answer: A decrease in temperature caused the water molecules to lose energy and slow down which result in water molecules that are closer together and decrease in water volume.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-temperature-in-a-river-rises>What happens when the temperature in a river rises?</h2>
<p>1 Answers. When the temperature of a river rises, the water particles move faster, which causes the water to heat up. This makes the water expand, although only to a very small extent. In addition, if a river is fast flowing some of the water may begin to evaporate, causing a mist over the surface of the river.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-water-molecules-as-the-temperature-increases>What happens to water molecules as the temperature increases?</h2>
<p>When you increase the temperature of a body, say water, you increase the speed of vibration in the molecules of that matter. This increases the speed of reactions in general, and the speed of the molecules movement. What happens to a glass of water as the average molecular kinetic energy of the water molecules increases?</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-fish-if-the-water-temperature-increases>What happens to fish if the water temperature increases?</h2>
<p>Already, water temperatures have risen enough to affect aquatic habitats and cause some species to migrate into cooler water. By some estimates, coldwater fish in North America — salmon and trout, for example — could lose as much as half their suitable habitat if average global temperatures increase by 8 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-change-in-water-temperature-affect-the-ecosystem>How does a change in water temperature affect the ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Changing Water Temperatures Can Negatively Impact Ecosystems. Rising air temperature are absorbed by water bodies, leading to increasing water temperatures. In general as air temperatures increase water temperature will generally rise in streams, lakes, and reservoirs.</p>
