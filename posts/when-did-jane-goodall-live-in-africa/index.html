<p>Early Years in Africa On April 2, 1957, at the age of 23, Jane travels to Kenya by boat. She has a wonderful time seeing Africa and meeting new people, but the most important event of her visit is meeting famous anthropologist and palaeontologist Dr Louis S B Leakey.</p>

<p>She is staying at her family home in England, not in Tanzania, her primary home when not on the road. Sign up for Science Times Get stories that capture the wonders of nature, the cosmos and the human body.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-jane-goodall-live>When did Jane Goodall Live?</h2>
<p>Jane Goodall, in full Dame Jane Goodall, original name Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall, (born April 3, 1934, London, England), British ethologist, known for her exceptionally detailed and long-term research on the chimpanzees of Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jane-goodall-do-in-africa>What did Jane Goodall do in Africa?</h2>
<p>In 1960, Jane Goodall entered the forests of what is now Gombe National Park, Tanzania, to study chimpanzees in the wild. Since her pioneering research in Gombe, it has now become the site of one of the longest continuously running and detailed wild animal studies in history at the Gombe Stream Research Center.</p>
<h2 id=does-jane-goodall-believe-in-god>Does Jane Goodall believe in God?</h2>
<p>When asked if she believes in God, Goodall said in September 2010: “I don’t have any idea of who or what God is. But I do believe in some great spiritual power. I feel it particularly when I’m out in nature. It’s just something that’s bigger and stronger than what I am or what anybody is.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-jane-goodall-impact-the-world>How did Jane Goodall impact the world?</h2>
<p>Through nearly 60 years of groundbreaking work, Dr. Jane Goodall has not only shown us the urgent need to protect chimpanzees from extinction; she has also redefined species conservation to include the needs of local people and the environment.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-jane-goodall-scared-of>What is Jane Goodall scared of?</h2>
<p>What is your greatest fear for the future of our planet? My fear is that, although the solutions are out there to make a better future, if we carry on with business as usual we will run out of time and the point of no return will come.</p>
<h2 id=do-apes-shake-hands>Do apes shake hands?</h2>
<p>A 12-year study run by the University of Antwerp found chimpanzees also develop unique handshake-like gestures specific to their social group. He believes the chimps may have learned to perform the grasps as a ritual, reminiscent of secret handshakes performed by humans.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-closest-animal-to-human>What is the closest animal to human?</h2>
<p>chimpanzee<br>
The chimpanzee and bonobo are humans’ closest living relatives. These three species look alike in many ways, both in body and behavior.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-jane-goodall-a-hero>Why is Jane Goodall a hero?</h2>
<p>When Jane Goodall was 26 years old, she went to the jungle in Africa to study chimps. Jane Goodall is considered a hero because she cares a lot about wildlife even when she was a little girl. Jane Goodall has spent her life in the jungles of Asia and Africa for 25 years studying chimpanzees.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-jane-goodall-when-she-went-to-africa>How old was Jane Goodall when she went to Africa?</h2>
<p>At age 23, she left for Africa to visit a friend, whose family lived on a farm outside Nairobi, Kenya. In March 1957 Jane boarded a ship called the Kenya Castle to visit her friend and her family.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-jane-goodall-when-she-started-studying-chimpanzees>How old was Jane Goodall when she started studying chimpanzees?</h2>
<p>Jane Goodall was only 26 when she traveled from England to what is now Tanzania to learn about wild chimpanzees in July 1960. The world knew very little about the species at the time.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jane-goodall-study-at-gombe-stream>What did Jane Goodall study at Gombe Stream?</h2>
<p>Leakey then asked her to return to England to study primate anatomy and behavior while he raised funds for the proposed field study. On July 14, 1960, Jane Goodall began setting up her camp at Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania. Leakey later arranged for Jane to earn her Ph.D. in ethology from Cambridge University.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-jane-goodalls-husband-derek-die>When did Jane Goodall’s husband Derek die?</h2>
<p>Their marriage doesn’t last long, however, when Derek dies of cancer in 1975. The Jane Goodall Institute is established (1977 to the present). Jane starts the Jane Goodall Institute to help people understand the importance of preserving the forests and the animals who live in them.</p>
