<h2 id=where-is-famine-most-common>Where is famine most common?</h2>
<p>Today, famine is most widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa, but with exhaustion of food resources, overdrafting of groundwater, wars, internal struggles, and economic failure, famine continues to be a worldwide problem with hundreds of millions of people suffering.</p>
<h2 id=is-famine-a-hazard>Is famine a hazard?</h2>
<p>Food-security emergencies are complex disasters with multiple root causes. Poor nutrition, brought on by food shortages, reduces people’s resistance to disease, and makes outbreaks of preventable diseases likely. …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-famine-caused-by>What is famine caused by?</h2>
<p>A natural disaster, such as a long period of drought, flooding, extreme cold, typhoons, insect infestations, or plant disease, combined with government decisions on how to respond to the disaster, can result in a famine. Human events also lead to famine. A major human cause of famine is warfare.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-after-a-famine>What happens after a famine?</h2>
<p>If the famine continues, more people will suffer from hunger and malnutrition — and the most vulnerable among them will die of starvation. Widespread death in these areas will occur. In places where famine is already taking place, there are two deaths per 10,000 people every day.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-people-on-the-brink-of-famine>Where are people on the brink of famine?</h2>
<p>About 30 million people are experiencing alarming hunger, severe levels of food insecurity and malnutrition in north-eastern Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen. 10 million of them are facing emergency and famine conditions. Famine is already likely happening in parts of northern Nigeria, while Yemen and Somalia are on the brink.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-current-famine-in-the-world>Where is the current famine in the world?</h2>
<p>These are extraordinary times. The current famine in parts of South Sudan is the first to strike anywhere in the world since 2011. And, as the same catastrophe looms over Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen, this is the first time in history children have faced the threat of four famines striking at once.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-world-food-programme-declare-famine>When does the World Food Programme declare famine?</h2>
<p>Most programmes now direct their aid towards Africa. According to the United Nations World Food Programme, famine is declared when malnutrition is widespread, and when people have started dying of starvation through lack of access to sufficient, nutritious food.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-distribution-of-food-affected-by-famine>How is the distribution of food affected by famine?</h2>
<p>The distribution of food has been affected by conflict. Most programmes now direct their aid towards Africa. According to the United Nations humanitarian criteria, even if there are food shortages with large numbers of people lacking nutrition, a famine is declared only when certain measures of mortality, malnutrition and hunger are met.</p>
