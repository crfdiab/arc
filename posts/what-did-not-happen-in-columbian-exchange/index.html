<h2 id=what-did-not-happen-in-columbian-exchange>What did not happen in Columbian Exchange?</h2>
<p>Europe would be much poorer in food crops without the Columbian Exchange. Potatoes a staple in Ireland, Vodka in Russia, and raised throughout Europe and Africa would not exist. Corn or maize would not have been available to Europe and Africa. The Americas would be much poorer without the Columbian Exchange.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-introduced-to-the-americas-through-the-columbian-exchange>What was introduced to the Americas through the Columbian Exchange?</h2>
<p>The Columbian Exchange brought horses, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and a collection of other useful species to the Americas. Before Columbus, Native American societies in the high Andes had domesticated llamas and alpacas, but no other animals weighing more than 45 kg (100 lbs).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-one-negative-thing-brought-to-the-americas-through-the-columbian-exchange>What was one negative thing brought to the Americas through the Columbian Exchange?</h2>
<p>Diseases were a huge negative impact. Diseases such as small pox and syphyllis were brought to the Americas by the Europeans and wiped out a large amount of the New World’s population. While slavery had a bit of a positive light, it was mostly a negative thing.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-columbian-exchange-affect-the-economy>How did the Columbian Exchange affect the economy?</h2>
<p>It affected economic development by making it possible for large scale trade networks between the Old World and the New World to develop. The Columbian Exchange caused population growth in Europe by bringing new crops from the Americas and started Europe’s economic shift towards capitalism.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-columbian-exchange-affect-the-new-world>How did the Columbian Exchange affect the New World?</h2>
<p>The Columbian Exchange: goods introduced by Europe, produced in New World. European rivals raced to create sugar plantations in the Americas and fought wars for control of production. Although refined sugar was available in the Old World, Europe’s harsher climate made sugarcane difficult to grow.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-europeans-bring-to-the-western-hemisphere>What did Europeans bring to the Western Hemisphere?</h2>
<p>THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE. The arrival of Europeans in the Americas brought more than a clash of peoples and cultures. It also brought a movement of plants, animals, and diseases between the Eastern and Western hemispheres. This movement of living things between hemispheres is called the Columbian Exchange.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-christopher-columbus-bring-to-the-new-world>What did Christopher Columbus bring to the New World?</h2>
<p>Christopher Columbus introduced horses, sugar plants, and disease to the New World, while facilitating the introduction of New World commodities like sugar, tobacco, chocolate, and potatoes to the Old World. The process by which commodities, people, and diseases crossed the Atlantic is known as the Columbian Exchange.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-there-no-coffee-before-the-columbian-exchange>Where was there no coffee before the Columbian Exchange?</h2>
<p>Before the Columbian Exchange, there were no oranges in Florida, no bananas in Ecuador, no paprika in Hungary, no potatoes in Ireland, no coffee in Colombia, no pineapples in Hawaii, no rubber trees in Africa, no chili peppers in Thailand, no tomatoes in Italy, and no chocolate in Switzerland.</p>
