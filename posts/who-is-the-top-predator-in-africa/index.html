<h2 id=who-is-the-top-predator-in-africa>Who is the top predator in Africa?</h2>
<p>As the apex predator of the African wild, the lion is one of the world’s top predators. Whilst humans are not their natural prey, each year an estimated 200 people are killed by lions.</p>
<h2 id=what-animal-is-the-1-apex-predator>What animal is the 1 apex predator?</h2>
<p>‘ In terms of animals causing human deaths, the lion is probably the most dangerous apex predator. In the wild, lions use cooperative hunting to prey on buffalo, rhino, hippo, younger elephants, zebra, crocodiles, antelopes, wild hogs, and younger giraffes.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-fiercest-predator-on-earth>What is the fiercest predator on earth?</h2>
<p>Of all the species in the world, the largest—and most dangerous—is the saltwater crocodile. These ferocious killers can grow up to 23 feet in length, weigh more than a ton, and are known to kill hundreds each year, with crocodiles as a whole responsible for more human fatalities annually than sharks.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-predator-that-ever-lived>What is the biggest predator that ever lived?</h2>
<p>Spinosaurus<br>
The Spinosaurus, the biggest land predator of all time, had a mouth similar to a crocodile’s, and it had straight teeth like knives. The title of largest land predator that ever walked on Earth goes to the Spinosaurus. This meat-eating dinosaur lived about 90-100 million years ago.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-humans-have-no-natural-predators>Why do humans have no natural predators?</h2>
<p>Originally Answered: Why don’t humans have natural predators? Humans don’t have natural predators because humans themselves are the apex predator in every food chain on the planet, including in the oceans. Humans don’t normally go travelling in the wilderness unarmed and alone. They normally travel in armed bands.</p>

<p>This is what makes it ‘the king of the jungle.’. In terms of animals causing human deaths, the lion is probably the most dangerous apex predator. In the wild, lions use cooperative hunting to prey on buffalo, rhino, hippo, younger elephants, zebra, crocodiles, antelopes, wild hogs, and younger giraffes.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-apex-predators-in-sub-saharan-africa>Are there any apex predators in Sub-Saharan Africa?</h2>
<p>In sub-Saharan Africa they are at the absolute pinnacle of the food chain and have no predators. None of the other species of big cats in its ecosystem will risk a conflict with a lion. That being said, they do still face dangers and because of this they live in family groups called prides.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-lions-considered-to-be-apex-predators>Why are lions considered to be apex predators?</h2>
<p>They mostly live in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population in India. They live in groups called prides, which have between 10 to 40 members. The lionesses in the prides are responsible for hunting by setting out in groups to chase after the prey. This cooperation is one of the many reasons why lions are feared and fierce predators.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-second-largest-apex-predator-after-the-tiger>Which is the second largest apex predator after the Tiger?</h2>
<p>The lion belongs to the family of cats and is the second largest existing cat after the tiger. Lions are apex predators although 50% of its feeds are achieved through scavenging.</p>
