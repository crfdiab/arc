<h2 id=what-was-the-first-law-in-history>What was the first law in history?</h2>
<p>The Code of Hammurabi was one of the earliest and most complete written legal codes and was proclaimed by the Babylonian king Hammurabi, who reigned from 1792 to 1750 B.C. Hammurabi expanded the city-state of Babylon along the Euphrates River to unite all of southern Mesopotamia.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-a-collection-of-laws-called>What is a collection of laws called?</h2>
<p>A code of law, also called a law code or legal code, is a type of legislation that purports to exhaustively cover a complete system of laws or a particular area of law as it existed at the time the code was enacted, by a process of codification.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-history-of-the-first-law-world>What is the history of the first law world?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-the-timetable-of-world-legal-history>What is the timetable of World legal history?</h2>
<p>The Timetable of World Legal History. Some form of law, is always the foundation of even primitive institutions. Law, as it were, has travelled a long, long blood-stained path.
