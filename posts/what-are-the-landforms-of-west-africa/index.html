<h2 id=what-are-the-landforms-of-west-africa>What are the landforms of West Africa?</h2>
<p>Most of West Africa’s mountain massifs and highlands, such as the Aïr Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Adrar des Ifoghas, and the Fouta Djallon, originated as Precambrian folds (Church, 1966). Much later, volcanic activity in many of these highlands deposited additional layers of igneous rock.</p>

<h2 id=what-are-the-two-major-grassland-areas-of-west-africa>What are the two major grassland areas of West Africa?</h2>
<p>The World Wide Fund for Nature divides the Sudanian savanna into two ecoregions, separated by the Cameroon Highlands. The West Sudanian savanna runs from the Atlantic Ocean to eastern Nigeria, and the East Sudanian savanna runs from the Cameroon Highlands east to the western lowlands of Ethiopia.</p>
