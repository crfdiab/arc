<p>Fire, disease, famine and Indian attacks remained, but according to Leccese, “One other important problem was the increasingly stratified society. As time went on, original settlers had snatched up all the quality land and new settlers were finding less opportunity to become independent farmers on their own land.</p>
<h2 id=what-difficulties-did-the-early-settlers-in-the-colonies-face>What difficulties did the early settlers in the colonies face?</h2>
<p>Lured to the New World with promises of wealth, most colonists were unprepared for the constant challenges they faced: drought, starvation, the threat of attack, and disease. With the help of stern leadership and a lucrative cash crop, the colony eventually succeeded.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonists-struggle-in-the-new-world>Why did the colonists struggle in the new world?</h2>
<p>Due to climate, the first settlers suffered disease and distress. Also, relations with Powhatan natives became strained. While Jamestown struggled in its early years, regular supplies from England sustained the colony.</p>

<p>Later, when the colonists won independence, these colonies became the 13 original states. Each colony had its own government, but the British king controlled these governments. By the 1770s, many colonists were angry because they did not have self-government. This meant that they could not govern themselves and make their own laws.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonists-choose-the-site-they-did-for-the-jamestown-colony>Why did the colonists choose the site they did for the Jamestown Colony?</h2>
