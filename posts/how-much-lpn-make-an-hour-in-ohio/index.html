<h2 id=where-do-lpns-get-paid-the-most>Where do LPNs get paid the most?</h2>

<h2 id=do-lpns-get-paid-more-than-rns>Do LPNs get paid more than RNs?</h2>
<p>Put simply, RNs make more money than their LPN counterparts. The median annual salary for RNs in 2014 was $66,640, according to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). Compared to the $42,490 reported for LPNs, we’re talking nearly $25,000 more annually!</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-become-an-lpn-in-ohio>How long does it take to become an LPN in Ohio?</h2>
<p>12 to 18 months<br>
LPN Program Length in Ohio You will be required to take classes that provide you with learning and hands-on experience. For a diploma or certificate, this could take 12 to 18 months. For a degree, you can expect to go to school for at least two years.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-make-a-living-as-a-lpn>Can you make a living as a LPN?</h2>
<p>The average annual salary for Licensed Practical Nurses (LPN) and Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVN) is $50,090 per year ($24.08 per hour), according to 2020 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). LPN’s in the top 10% earn more than $65,000 per year ($31.50 hourly based on a 40-hour workweek).</p>
<h2 id=should-i-become-an-lpn-or-rn>Should I become an LPN or RN?</h2>
<p>Deciding between an LPN or RN program remains a personal choice. Individuals who pursue an LPN generally want a quicker pathway to a new career. The LPN program takes about one year, compared to 2-4 years for the RN program. After working in nursing, LPNs can pursue a bachelor’s degree and become an RN.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-lpns-make-less-than-rns>Why do LPNs make less than RNs?</h2>
<p>LPNs will likely earn lower salaries than RNs. This is because RNs have more advanced training and can carry out more complex types of patient care. Average salaries across both professions depend largely on your education, experience and where you practice and typically do not reflect entry-level positions.</p>
<h2 id=do-lpn-make-good-money>Do LPN make good money?</h2>
<p>No – plain and simple. LPN wages will not support a family (say 2 adults and two kids ) comfortably. Sure, you can work OT, but then you’re taking away time from the family which greatly reduces quality of life for everyone involved.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-starting-salary-of-an-lpn>What is the average starting salary of an LPN?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-the-starting-pay-for-an-lpn>What is the starting pay for an LPN?</h2>
<p>PayScale.com reported a salary range of $26,000-$50,000 and a median income of $38,787 for entry-level LPNs in May 2019. Your salary may also be impacted by your employer and location choices.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-do-lpns-get-paid>How much do LPN’s get paid?</h2>
