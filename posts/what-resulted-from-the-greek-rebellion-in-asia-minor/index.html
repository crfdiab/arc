<h2 id=what-resulted-from-the-greek-rebellion-in-asia-minor>What resulted from the Greek rebellion in Asia Minor?</h2>
<p>Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt….Ionian Revolt.</p>
<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>499–493 BC</th></tr><tr><td>Result</td><td>Decisive Persian victory</td></tr><tr><td>Territorial changes</td><td>Persia re-establishes control over Greek regions in Asia Minor and Cyprus.</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=when-did-the-greek-colonies-in-asia-minor-revolt>When did the Greek colonies in Asia Minor revolt?</h2>
<p>Ionian revolt, uprising (499–494 bce) of some of the Ionian cities of Asia Minor against their Persian overlords. The cities deposed their own tyrants and, with help from Athens, tried unsuccessfully to throw off Persian domination.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-persian-and-greek-conflict-in-asia-minor>What caused the Persian and Greek conflict in Asia Minor?</h2>
<p>The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks and the enormous empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered the Greek-inhabited region of Ionia in 547 BC. Struggling to control the independent-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them.</p>
<h2 id=did-sparta-fight-athens>Did Sparta fight Athens?</h2>
<p>The Peloponnesian War was a war fought in ancient Greece between Athens and Sparta—the two most powerful city-states in ancient Greece at the time (431 to 405 B.C.E.). The war featured two periods of combat separated by a six-year truce.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-legacy-of-ancient-greece>Which is a legacy of ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>Ancient Greece is remembered for developing democracy, inventing Western philosophy, realistic art, developing theater like comedy and tragedy, the Olympic Games, inventing pi, and the Pythagoras theorem.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-ionians-revolt-against-persia>Why did the Ionians revolt against Persia?</h2>
<p>According to Herodotus one of the causes of the revolt was the plotting of Histiaeus, deposed Tyrant of Miletus. He was living in forced exile at the Persian court at Susa, while his son-in-law Aristagoras ruled Miletus. Histiaeus wrote to his successor encouraging him to revolt.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-darius-invade-greece>Why did Darius invade Greece?</h2>
<p>The invasion, consisting of two distinct campaigns, was ordered by the Persian king Darius the Great primarily in order to punish the city-states of Athens and Eretria. Darius also saw the opportunity to extend his empire into Europe, and to secure its western frontier.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-3-persian-wars>What were the 3 Persian wars?</h2>
<p>Several of the most famous and significant battles in history were fought during the Wars, these were at Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis, and Plataea, all of which would become legendary. The Greeks were, ultimately, victorious and their civilization preserved.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-persian-wars>What are the 3 Persian wars?</h2>
<p>The Persian Wars were a series of wars fought between the Persians and the Greeks from 492 BC to 449 BC.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who were the Persians?</li>
<li>Who were the Greeks?</li>
<li>Ionians.</li>
<li>First Invasion of Greece.</li>
<li>Battle of Marathon.</li>
<li>Second Invasion of Greece.</li>
<li>Battle of Thermopylae.</li>
<li>Battle of Salamis.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=where-was-the-location-of-the-ionian-revolt>Where was the location of the Ionian Revolt?</h2>
<p>Location and main events of the Ionian Revolt. Persia re-establishes control over Greek regions in Asia Minor and Cyprus. The Ionian Revolt, and associated revolts in Aeolis, Doris, Cyprus and Caria, were military rebellions by several Greek regions of Asia Minor against Persian rule, lasting from 499 BC to 493 BC.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-ionians-revolt-against-darius-the-great>Why did the Ionians revolt against Darius the Great?</h2>
<p>The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great . In 498 BC, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, the Ionians marched on, captured, and burnt Sardis.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-herodotusapproach-to-the-ionian-revolt>What was herodotus’approach to the Ionian Revolt?</h2>
<p>Herodotus’s approach was entirely novel, and at least from the point of view of Western society, he does seem to have invented ‘history’ as we know it.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-cyrus-the-great-refuse-to-help-the-ionians>Why did Cyrus the Great refuse to help the Ionians?</h2>
<p>After Cyrus completed the conquest of Lydia, the Ionian cities now offered to be his subjects under the same terms as they had been subjects of Croesus. Cyrus refused, citing the Ionians’ unwillingness to help him previously. The Ionians thus prepared to defend themselves, and Cyrus sent the Median general Harpagus to conquer Ionia.</p>
