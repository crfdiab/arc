<h2 id=what-instrument-is-used-to-measure-the-force-of-an-earthquake>What instrument is used to measure the force of an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Seismographs are instruments used to record the motion of the ground during an earthquake.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-force-of-an-earthquake-measured>How is the force of an earthquake measured?</h2>
<p>The Richter magnitude of an earthquake is determined from the logarithm of the amplitude of waves recorded by seismographs. Adjustments are included for the variation in the distance between the various seismographs and the epicenter of the earthquakes.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-instrument-measures-the-force-and-duration-of-an-earthquake>What type of instrument measures the force and duration of an earthquake?</h2>
<p>A seismograph, or seismometer, is an instrument used to detect and record earthquakes. Generally, it consists of a mass attached to a fixed base. During an earthquake, the base moves and the mass does not.</p>
<h2 id=what-instrument-measures-magnitude>What instrument measures magnitude?</h2>
<p>seismographs<br>
Magnitude measures the amount of seismic energy released at the source – or hypocenter – of an earthquake. An earthquake has only one magnitude determined from measurements on seismographs. The first widely-used measurement was the Richter scale.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-instruments-are-used-to-measure-earthquakes>What kind of instruments are used to measure earthquakes?</h2>
<p>The seismograph and the seismoscope are the two main instruments used to measure the strength of earthquakes. The seismoscope is a simple instrument that measures the time that an earthquake takes place. The seismograph records the motion of the ground during an earthquake. A seismograph’s main…</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-seismograph-measure-the-force-of-an-earthquake>How does a seismograph measure the force of an earthquake?</h2>
<p>seismograph measures strength of an earthquake; measurement is based on the size of seismic waves 2 measures strength of larger earthquakes; measurement is based on multiple variables 3 measures effects of an earthquake; measurement can vary from place to place</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-vibrations-produced-by-an-earthquake-measured>How are the vibrations produced by an earthquake measured?</h2>
<p>The vibrations produced by earthquakes are detected, recorded, and measured by instruments call seismographs1. The zig-zag line made by a seismograph, called a “seismogram,” reflects the changing intensity of the vibrations by responding to the motion of the ground surface beneath the instrument.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-richter-scale-used-to-measure-earthquakes>How is the Richter scale used to measure earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Seismologists today do not use the Richter scale as a universal tool for measuring earthquakes, because it does not accurately measure the energy emitted in jolts as big as the one that hit Japan. Instead, scientists use the moment magnitude scale, developed in the 1970s.</p>
