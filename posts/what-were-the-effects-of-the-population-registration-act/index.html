<h2 id=what-were-the-effects-of-the-population-registration-act>What were the effects of the Population Registration Act?</h2>
<p>The effects of population registration act were that it led to the implementation of many discriminatory laws based on race.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-population-registration-act-law-passed>Why was the Population Registration Act law passed?</h2>
<p>The Population Registration Act determined people’s race classification, which in turn determined the implementation of many other racially based laws. One of the apartheid laws passed in the 1950s was the Group Areas Act, which determined where people of different racial groups could live.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-group-areas-act-of-1950-do>What did the Group Areas Act of 1950 do?</h2>
<p>Under the Group Areas Act (1950) the cities and towns of South Africa were divided into segregated residential and business areas. Thousands of Coloureds, Blacks, and Indians were removed from areas classified for white occupation. The Group Areas Act and the Land Acts maintained residential segregation.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-population-registration-act-repealed>When was the Population Registration Act repealed?</h2>
<p>The Population Registration Act Repeal Act, 1991 (Act No. 114 of 1991) is an act of the Parliament of South Africa which repealed the Population Registration Act, 1950, ending the legal racial classification of South Africans which formed the basis of apartheid.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-population-registration-act-mean>What did the Population Registration Act mean?</h2>
<p>Population Registration Act. The Population Registration Act No 30 of 1950 (commenced 7 July) required people to be identified and registered from birth as one of four distinct racial groups: White, Coloured, Bantu (Black African), and other. It was one of the ‘pillars’ of Apartheid.</p>
<h2 id=who-passed-the-population-registration-act>Who passed the Population Registration Act?</h2>
<p>South Africa’s Apartheid Era Population Registration Act. Alistair Boddy-Evans is a teacher and African history scholar with more than 25 years of experience. South Africa’s Population Registration Act No. 30 (commenced on July 7) was passed in 1950 and defined in clear terms who belonged to a particular race.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-forced-removals-affect-peoples-lives>How did forced removals affect people’s lives?</h2>
<p>Forced removals are thus a cause of social conflict, and prevent reconciliation and mutual enrichment of the society. Under the apartheid laws, people were uprooted from their land if it was declared a black spot. Negotiations with the government was futile, as the laws were there to be obeyed.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-laws-during-apartheid>What were the laws during apartheid?</h2>
<p>Apartheid Becomes Law By 1950, the government had banned marriages between whites and people of other races, and prohibited sexual relations between black and white South Africans. In some cases, the legislation split families; parents could be classified as white, while their children were classified as colored.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-population-registration-act-of-1950-affect-south-africa>How did the Population Registration Act of 1950 affect South Africa?</h2>
<p>The Population Registration Act of 1950 affected the rights of specific racial groups living in South Africa during the apartheid era because this act was the foundation for future laws and other government actions that only affected certain racial groups, whose members were classified by the Population Registration Act of 1950.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-population-registration-act>What was the purpose of the Population Registration Act?</h2>
<p>Act to make provision for the compilation of a Register of the Population of the Union; for the issue of Identity Cards to persons whose names are included in the Register; and for matters incidental thereto.</p>

<p>Repeal of The Population Registration Act The South African Parliament repealed the act on June 17, 1991. However, the racial categories set forth by the act are still ingrained in the culture of South Africa. They also still underlie some of the official policies designed to remedy past economic inequalities. Source “War Measures Continuation.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-immorality-amendment-act-of-1950-repealed>When was the Immorality Amendment Act of 1950 repealed?</h2>
