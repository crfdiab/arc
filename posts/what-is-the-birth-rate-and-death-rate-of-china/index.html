<h2 id=how-is-the-birth-rate-and-death-rate-related>How is the birth rate and death rate related?</h2>
<p>Both the birth and death rate are given per 1,000 people of the country’s population. population is increasing; those below the line have a declining population.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-china-in-2019>What was the population of China in 2019?</h2>
<p>China’s population ‘to peak at 1.44bn’ Despite the birth rate falling, a lower death rate meant China’s population hit 1.4bn in 2019, inching up from 1.39bn. But the falling birth rate is raising fears of a “demographic timebomb” – that is, a smaller working-age population having to support a bigger, retired population.</p>
