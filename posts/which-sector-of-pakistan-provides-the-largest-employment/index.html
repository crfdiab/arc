<h2 id=which-sector-of-pakistan-provides-the-largest-employment>Which sector of Pakistan provides the largest employment?</h2>
<p>Cotton textile production and apparel manufacturing are Pakistan’s largest industries, accounting for about 65% of the merchandise exports and almost 40% of the employed labour force.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-workers-are-in-pakistan>How many workers are in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>57.2 million<br>
According to data produced by the CIA World Factbook, the total number of Pakistan’s labour force is 57.2 million, making it the ninth largest country by available human workforce. About 43% of this labour is involved in agriculture, 20.3% in industry and the remaining 36.6% in other services.</p>
<h2 id=in-which-sector-most-of-the-population-is-employed>In which sector most of the population is employed?</h2>
<p>The primary sector continues to be the largest employer even now. Even though industrial output or the production of goods went up by nine times during the period, employment in the industry went up by only three times , the same applies to tertiary as well.</p>
<h2 id=which-sector-has-highest-employment-in-india>Which sector has highest employment in India?</h2>
<p>In 2019, 42.6 percent of the workforce in India were employed in agriculture, while the other half was almost evenly distributed among the two other sectors, industry and services. While the share of Indians working in agriculture is declining, it is still the main sector of employment.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-employed-in-pakistan-per-year>How many people are employed in Pakistan per year?</h2>
<p>Employed Persons in Pakistan averaged 39594.79 Thousand from 1986 until 2018, reaching an all time high of 62230 Thousand in 2017 and a record low of 5580 Thousand in 2012.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-tertiary-sector-the-most-producing-sector-in-india>Is the tertiary sector the most producing sector in India?</h2>
<p>Answer: No, this is not correct. The tertiary sector is playing a significant role in the development of the Indian Economy. In the year 2003, the tertiary sector replaced the primary sector as the most producing sector in the country. A few reasons to support this are given below:</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-jobs-do-people-have-in-pakistan>What kind of jobs do people have in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>In 2018, 41.67 percent of the workforce in Pakistan worked in the agricultural sector, about a quarter worked in industry, and 34.69 percent in the services sector.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-tertiary-sector-contribute-to-national-income>How does tertiary sector contribute to national income?</h2>
<p>The tertiary sector adds up a lot to the National income of the country. Education, which is the basis of everything, comes under the tertiary sector. A person working as a teacher comes under the tertiary sector. This sector provides the maximum employment opportunities to the people in the country.</p>
