<h2 id=is-the-red-sea-actually-red>Is the Red Sea actually red?</h2>
<p>Normally, the Red Sea is an intense blue-green; occasionally, however, it is populated by extensive blooms of the algae Trichodesmium erythraeum, which, upon dying off, turn the sea a reddish brown colour.</p>
<h2 id=why-red-sea-is-not-red>Why Red Sea is not red?</h2>
<p>Occasionally, the sea becomes filled with blooms of cyanobacteria algae, called trichodesmium erythraeum, which, upon dying, turn the usually blue-green water, reddish-brown. The color is not intense and is said to vary across the expansive body of water.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-red-sea-dangerous>Is the Red Sea dangerous?</h2>
<p>Stinging and venomous fish The fish is extremely well camouflaged and care should be taken to avoid stepping on it. The venom can be fatal. Lionfish such as Pterois miles have stinging spines which rarely inflict a fatal wound but which may be extremely painful.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-dead-sea-dead>Is the Dead Sea dead?</h2>
<p>The Dead Sea’s main, northern basin is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide at its widest point. The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean Basin for thousands of years….</p>

<h2 id=which-is-the-saltiest-sea>Which is the saltiest sea?</h2>
<p>Atlantic Ocean<br>
Of the five ocean basins, the Atlantic Ocean is the saltiest. On average, there is a distinct decrease of salinity near the equator and at both poles, although for different reasons.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-most-dangerous-animal-in-the-red-sea>What is the most dangerous animal in the Red Sea?</h2>
<p>Lionfish<br>
Lionfish are dangerous when you touch them. The family of scorpionfish, which include the stonefish, the scorpionfish, the lionfish and the Red Sea walkman, is extremely poisonous. The spines of these fish are located on their backs.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-red-land-called-the-sea-of-red-land>Why was the Red land called the Sea of red land?</h2>
<p>One popular explanation is due to the fact that it is so close to the Egyptian desert which was once called the ‘Dashret’, meaning ‘redland’ by the Ancient Egyptians. It would have be known as the sea of the red land and while this seems like it could be a possibility, there are many other theories so we do not know which one is definitely correct.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-waters-of-the-red-sea-red>Why are the waters of the Red Sea Red?</h2>
<p>The short answer that we can understand today is the reddish brown algae answer. The color of the waters we see, whether oceans, seas or lakes can change due to algal blooms. For example the term, Red Tide that we see in other oceans, is due to algae as well.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-black-sea-north-of-the-red-sea>Why is the Black Sea north of the Red Sea?</h2>
<p>The Black Sea is north of the Red Sea, but it is not a tropical sea.) The short answer that we can understand today is the reddish brown algae answer. The color of the waters we see, whether oceans, seas or lakes can change due to algal blooms. For example the term, Red Tide that we see in other oceans, is due to algae as well.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-sinai-peninsula-called-the-red-sea>Why is the Sinai Peninsula called the Red Sea?</h2>
<p>Located at the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula in what’s known as the Red Sea Riviera, this marine park protects the area from fishing (including dynamite fishing) and unsustainable development along the shore, ensuring the marine life flourishes for future generations.</p>
