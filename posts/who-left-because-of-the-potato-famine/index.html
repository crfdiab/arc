<h2 id=who-left-because-of-the-potato-famine>Who left because of the potato famine?</h2>
<p>Emigration from the country, which had steadily increased in the years leading up to the famine, ballooned, and by 1855 2 million people had fled, swelling the immigrant Irish populations of Canada, the United States, Australia and elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id=what-immigrants-came-to-america-to-escape-the-potato-famine>What immigrants came to America to escape the potato famine?</h2>
<p>In the 1840s, the Irish potato sent waves of migrants who could afford passage fleeing starvation in the countryside. The Irish made up one half of all migrants to the country during the 1840s. From 1820 to the start of the Civil War, they constituted one third of all immigrants.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-leave-ireland-and-come-to-america>Why did people leave Ireland and come to America?</h2>
<p>Pushed out of Ireland by religious conflicts, lack of political autonomy and dire economic conditions, these immigrants, who were often called “Scotch-Irish,” were pulled to America by the promise of land ownership and greater religious freedom. Many Scotch-Irish immigrants were educated, skilled workers.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-germans-immigrate-to-america>Why did Germans immigrate to America?</h2>
<p>In the decade from 1845 to 1855, more than a million Germans fled to the United States to escape economic hardship. They also sought to escape the political unrest caused by riots, rebellion and eventually a revolution in 1848.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-irish-come-to-america-during-the-potato-famine>Where did the Irish come to America during the Potato Famine?</h2>
<p>Throughout the Famine years, 75 percent of the Irish coming to America landed in New York. In 1847, about 52,000 Irish arrived in the city which had a total population of 372,000. The Irish were not the only big group of immigrants arriving.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-die-during-the-potato-famine>How did people die during the Potato Famine?</h2>
<p>In 1849, the famine was officially at an end, but suffering continued throughout Ireland. More than 1 million people died between 1846 and 1851 as a result of the Potato Famine. Many of these died from starvation. Many more died from diseases that preyed on people weakened by loss of food.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-free-church-help-during-the-potato-famine>How did the Free Church help during the Potato Famine?</h2>
<p>Additionally, the Free Church organised transport for over 3,000 men from the famine-struck regions to work on the Lowland railways. This both removed people who needed to be fed from the area and provided money for their families to buy food. The British government took early notice of the crop failure.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-landlords-do-during-the-highland-potato-famine>What did the landlords do during the Highland Potato Famine?</h2>
<p>Highland landlords organised and paid for the emigration of more than 16,000 of their tenants and a significant but unknown number paid for their own passage. Evidence suggests that the majority of Highlanders who permanently left the famine-struck regions emigrated, rather than moving to other parts of Scotland.</p>
