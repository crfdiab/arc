<p>Recycling aluminum cans saves a considerable amount of energy; it also reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the amount of waste headed into landfills. Collecting your cans for recycling is an important step you can take to help the environment.</p>
<h2 id=are-cans-better-for-the-environment>Are cans better for the environment?</h2>
<p>Cans are lighter than glass and aren’t made from fossil fuels either, like plastic. Because of the processes involved in making them, cans also contribute less to environmental problems like acid rain and oxygen-free zones in the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-impact-of-recycling-tin-cans-on-the-environment>What is the impact of recycling tin cans on the environment?</h2>
<p>Mining and refining bauxite and smelting aluminum is immensely energy intensive, uses large amounts of water, and generates air, water, and soil pollution. Making aluminum is harmful to the environment and the people who live near mining, refining, or smelting operations.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-benefits-of-recycling-cans>What are the benefits of recycling cans?</h2>
<p>Benefits of Recycling</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators.</li>
<li>Conserves natural resources such as timber, water and minerals.</li>
<li>Increases economic security by tapping a domestic source of materials.</li>
<li>Prevents pollution by reducing the need to collect new raw materials.</li>
<li>Saves energy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=is-glass-better-than-cans>Is glass better than cans?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the lifecycle analysis considers glass bottles more environmentally friendly due to their lower greenhouse gas emissions that aluminum cans, which are estimated to result in 1.88 times more emissions. And if recycled cans aren’t an option, the next-best choice is to opt for glass bottles instead.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-recycle-metal-cans>Why is it important to recycle metal cans?</h2>
<p>By recycling more metal you can lessen the demand for natural resources such a sore. It also takes far less energy to process recycled metal than it does to mine ore, purify it and then shape it. This is one of the most important reasons as to why you should recycle your metal.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-reuse-cans>Why do we reuse cans?</h2>
<p>Why Recycle Aluminum Cans? Aluminum and tin recycling provides many environmental, economic and community benefits. It saves energy, time, money and natural resources; and often it generates jobs and helps to pay for community services that make life better for millions of people.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-recycling-help-to-save-the-planet>How does recycling help to save the planet?</h2>
<p>Wynn SardenFollow. Finally, recycling can help save on our expenses and resources. It helps reduce the amount of materials that are wasted or thrown in landfills such as paper, plastic, glass, and aluminium. This also enables companies to rely less on raw materials, which requires more energy for manufacturing a new product.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-environmental-benefits-to-recycle-cans>Are there any environmental benefits to recycle cans?</h2>
<p>Steel can be recycled time and time again without loss of quality, so by simply recycling our steel we can: reduce the emission of gasses like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Both aluminium and steel are easy to recycle and there are huge environmental benefits for doing this – yet many cans still go to landfill.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-recycling-reduce-the-size-of-landfills>How does recycling reduce the size of landfills?</h2>
<p>Recycling Reduces the Size of Landfills. One of the most important effects of recycling is its power to reduce the strain local landfills have on our environment. We can use waste products in a constructive way to slowly decrease the size of our (otherwise massive) landfills.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-energy-does-one-ton-of-recycled-paper-save>How much energy does one ton of recycled paper save?</h2>
<p>One ton of recycled newsprint saves 601 Kwh of energy, 1.7 barrels of oil (71 gallons), 10.2 million BTU’s of energy, 60 pounds of air pollutants from being released, 7,000 gallons of water, and 4.6 cubic yards of landfill space. Office Paper. One ton of recycled office paper saves 4,100 Kwh of energy,…</p>
