<h2 id=what-are-popular-hobbies-in-germany>What are popular hobbies in Germany?</h2>
<p>German people have many different hobbies that include playing outdoor games, skating, boating, cycling, gardening, singing, playing instruments, dance, pottery, sketching, writing and so on. Traveling is another favorite hobby of the German people.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-germans-do-for-sports>What do Germans do for sports?</h2>
<p>Football is undoubtedly the most popular spectator sport in Germany. Tens of thousands of individuals attend matches every week. Tickets to Bundesliga and national games aren’t that easy to come by, but they are significantly cheaper than, for example, tickets to the English Premier League.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-drinking-age-in-germany>What is the drinking age in Germany?</h2>
<p>Per Germany’s Youth Protection Act, beer, wine and wine-like beverages may not be sold to children and young people under the age of 16. The legal drinking age for spirits is 18.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-recreation-do-people-do-in-germany>What kind of recreation do people do in Germany?</h2>
<p>Private recreation typically includes spectator amusements and sports (especially football), active sports and physical exercise, automobile excursions, the pursuit of hobbies, visits with friends and family, and the long-favoured German pastime of walking or hiking.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-best-places-to-do-outdoor-activities-in-germany>Where are the best places to do outdoor activities in Germany?</h2>
<p>Hike in the Bavarian Alps Germany also has a good chunk of the Alps – the biggest mountain range in Europe – and it is found in southern Bavaria. It provides all the great and fun outdoor activities all year round: from hiking, cycling and camping in summer, to skiing and snowboarding in winter. Why go there?</p>
<h2 id=what-do-people-in-germany-like-to-do>What do people in Germany like to do?</h2>
<p>In winter Germans love to ski in the south of Germany where many low mountains are located. Among outdoor sports, German people love to play soccer. Handball is also popular in Germany.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-leisure-in-germany>What was the role of leisure in Germany?</h2>
<p>Leisure in Germany is now regarded—much like education and vocational training, decent housing, a job, good public transportation, health and disability insurance, and pensions—as an entitlement and a valuable adjunct of social policy. In East Germany, leisure activity was arranged very differently.</p>
