<h2 id=what-did-emirates-stadium-used-to-be>What did Emirates Stadium used to be?</h2>
<p>Ashburton Grove<br>
The stadium name is colloquially shortened from “Emirates Stadium” to “The Emirates”, although some supporters continue to use the former name “Ashburton Grove” or even “The Grove”, particularly those who object to the concept of corporate sponsorship of stadium names.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-emirates-stadium>Why is it called Emirates Stadium?</h2>
<p>In November 1999, Arsenal decided to leave Highbury and construct a new 60,000-seat stadium in nearby Ashburton Grove. It was confirmed in October 2004 that the new stadium would be called the Emirates Stadium as part of a sponsorship deal with Emirates Airlines.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-best-seats-at-emirates-stadium>Where are the best seats at Emirates Stadium?</h2>
<p>The padded seats and sufficient leg room don’t make up for the poor viewing angles of any bottom-tier seating, especially behind the goals. It’s a modern stadium, but you’ll want to be as high off the ground as possible for a good view. Please login first to submit.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-emirates-stadium-in-highbury-located>Where is the Emirates Stadium in Highbury located?</h2>
<p>/ ﻿ 51.55667°N 0.10611°W ﻿ / 51.55667; -0.10611 The Emirates Stadium (known as Ashburton Grove prior to sponsorship, and as Arsenal Stadium for UEFA competitions) is a football stadium in Highbury, England, and the home of Arsenal.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-emirates-stadium-opened-to-the-public>When was the Emirates Stadium opened to the public?</h2>
<p>The third event was Dennis Bergkamp’s testimonial match against Ajax on 22 July 2006. The Emirates Stadium was officially opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 26 October 2006; his wife Queen Elizabeth II had suffered a back injury and was unable to carry out her duty.</p>
<h2 id=where-to-get-alcohol-at-the-emirates-stadium>Where to get alcohol at the Emirates Stadium?</h2>
<p>Along Holloway Road and again around a ten minute walk from the Emirates Stadium is the Coronet, a Wetherspoons outlet, which normally has a good mix of home and visiting supporters on matchdays. Otherwise, alcohol is available inside the stadium, although rather pricey at £5.70 a pint. What is it like for visiting supporters?</p>
