<h2 id=is-tap-water-safe-for-sea-monkeys>Is tap water safe for Sea-Monkeys?</h2>
<p>Unlike Triops and other freshwater branchiopods, Artemia (Sea-Monkeys) do not need low-mineral water for hatching. So ideally use bottled spring water or tap water treated with aquarium water conditioner.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-clean-sea-monkey-water>Do you have to clean sea monkey water?</h2>
<p>Sea monkeys are hatched in unchlorinated saltwater and usually appear within 24 hours. They will then develop into tiny translucent shrimp with tails that vaguely resemble the tail of a monkey. Sea monkeys are low maintenance pets, but you need to keep the water clean and well-oxygenated at all times.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-eat-sea-monkeys>Is it safe to eat Sea-Monkeys?</h2>
<p>Sea-Monkeys Are Edible Yes, they are. Even though you may love your pet Sea-Monkeys, they are, after all, just tiny shrimp. Sea-Monkeys can grow to be about half an inch long (15 mm) but that’s still too small to eat using silverware. It might be easier just to drink your Sea-Monkeys.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-my-sea-monkeys-keep-dying>Why do my Sea-Monkeys keep dying?</h2>
<p>Over feeding can cause bacteria to multiply in the tank and once out of control the bacteria will eat up all the oxygen from the water and your Sea-Monkeys will suffocate and die.</p>
<h2 id=can-sea-monkeys-live-forever>Can Sea-Monkeys live forever?</h2>
<p>The life expectancy of a sea-monkey is two years. But they reproduce a lot so as long as you care for them properly and remove the dead ones from the tank you ought to have a supply of them forever.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-all-my-baby-sea-monkeys-die>Why did all my baby Sea-Monkeys die?</h2>
<h2 id=do-you-stir-sea-monkeys>Do you Stir Sea-Monkeys?</h2>
<p>Do not stir. Feed one level scoop of food from the Sea-Monkey® Feeding Spoon” once a week. To feed adult Sea-Monkeys® use the large cup. NOTE: If the water gets cloudy, you are over feeding them.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-sea-monkeys-die>Why did Sea-Monkeys Die?</h2>
<h2 id=do-sea-monkeys-come-back-to-life>Do Sea-Monkeys come back to life?</h2>
<p>This is called “cryptobiosis” and it’s a Sea Monkey’s greatest trait! Add the sea salt chemical packet to some water and the “Sea-Monkeys” will spring to life! Over the next few weeks they’ll steadily grow as you feed them yeast and spirulina (a blue-green algae that can be consumed by humans and other animals.)</p>
<h2 id=do-sea-monkeys-have-brains>Do Sea-Monkeys have brains?</h2>
<p>A Brine Shrimp doesn’t have a brain but has a collection of nerves that tell him what bodily function he should be doing at any given time. A brine shrimps anatomy is not as advanced as other pets. Sea-Monkey Care. Sea-Monkey maintenance is minimal, which is why they are a popular mail order item.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-all-my-sea-monkeys-die>Why did all my Sea-Monkeys die?</h2>
<h2 id=is-there-anything-that-can-kill-a-sea-monkey>Is there anything that can kill a Sea Monkey?</h2>
<p>Cleansers contain chemicals that can kill your sea creatures. This next tip requires ADULT SUPERVISION: To insure an item is sterile, boil it in water. This will kill any bacteria or agents that may be harmful to your Sea-Monkey pets. Remember, ASK FOR ASSISTANCE! The Carbonic Plague:</p>
<h2 id=can-you-put-sea-monkeys-in-fresh-water>Can you put Sea Monkeys in fresh water?</h2>
<p>Not to worry. As the water evaporates from your sea pet tank you will find that salt becomes more concentrated. The sea monkeys or sea pets will adapt to the water, but don’t throw in salt unless you have thrown in a lot of fresh water. In this case it will be a shock on them.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-sea-monkey-have-too-much-oxygen>Can a sea monkey have too much oxygen?</h2>
<p>The water can be contaminated or not have enough oxygen. Aerate -thus blow in fresh oxygen into the tank once a day for 14 days or stir the water for 30 seconds a day to give them some more oxygen. There can also be too many sea-monkeys in the tank. Seperate the babies from the adults by transferring them to another tank.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-do-if-my-sea-monkey-baby-dies>What should I do if my sea monkey baby dies?</h2>
<p>Get a 300ml jar and clean it well. Make sure it is well rinsed and transfer the sea-monkey babies. You should however use the water purifier first to ensure there are no harmful bacteria in the water. Leave for 24 hours and add the babies to their nursery. My sea-monkey babies die before they become adults, what can the problem be?</p>
