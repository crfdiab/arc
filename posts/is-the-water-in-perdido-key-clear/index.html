<h2 id=is-the-water-in-perdido-key-clear>Is the water in Perdido Key clear?</h2>
<p>When you stay in a beach vacation house in Perdido Key, you have easy access to the many treasures in store for you underwater. You can snorkel in the crystal clear waters from just about any of the white sand beaches in Perdido Key and see sea turtles, fish and other wildlife.</p>
<h2 id=what-ocean-is-perdido-key>What ocean is Perdido Key?</h2>
<p>the Gulf of Mexico<br>
The azure waters of the Gulf of Mexico frame the white beaches. These beaches and their dune habitat host a variety of visitors and residents throughout the year. The beach dune habitat of Perdido Key is characterized by several rows of sand dunes.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-perdido-key-beaches>How are Perdido Key beaches?</h2>
<p>Perdido Key is a pristine beach destination with gorgeous white quartz sand beaches and emerald waters on the Gulf side, rolling dunes across the middle and calmer beaches on the Sound side.</p>
<h2 id=is-perdido-bay-polluted>Is Perdido Bay polluted?</h2>
<p>Perdido River and Bay Watershed The Perdido River provides most of the bays fresh water. However, the quality of the water within the basin is regularly lower than other basins in the NWFWMD. The single largest source of pollution in this basin is the Champion Paper Mill located on Elevenmile Creek.</p>
<h2 id=is-perdido-key-as-pretty-as-destin>Is Perdido Key as pretty as Destin?</h2>
<p>Perdido Key is more laid back than Destin. Personally, while the water is pretty, I don’t think it is as pretty in Perdido Key (clarity), but the beach is just as nice. The water in Destin is absolutely gorgeous! My kids like the Destin area better than Perdido Key as there are more things to do in Destin.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-alligators-in-perdido-bay>Are there alligators in Perdido Bay?</h2>
<p>There were no calls on the alligator on Perdido Key. Though not as common as they are in central and south Florida, alligators do live here and they are found on our barrier islands.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-swim-in-perdido-bay>Is it safe to swim in Perdido Bay?</h2>
<p>As an Alabama environmental group has raised concerns about algal blooms in Perdido Bay, Escambia County scientists say they have found no harmful toxins. So we are advising citizens to be safe and not swim if they are seeing this harmful algal bloom in their water.”</p>
<h2 id=where-is-perdido-key-in-the-united-states>Where is Perdido Key in the United States?</h2>
<p>Perdido Key, Florida. Perdido Key is an unincorporated community in Escambia County, Florida, United States, between Pensacola and Orange Beach, Alabama. “Perdido” means “lost” in the Spanish and Portuguese languages. The community is located on and named for Perdido Key, a barrier island in northwest Florida and southeast Alabama.</p>
<h2 id=where-to-find-the-best-fish-in-perdido-key>Where to find the best fish in Perdido Key?</h2>
<p>More than just a town, Perdido Key is an entire barrier island, meaning that you can find fish in all directions. From the grassy beds and mangroves inshore to the reefs and deep waters offshore, there’s no shortage of angling action. So let’s see what you can go after!</p>
<h2 id=are-there-sand-dunes-in-perdido-key-florida>Are there sand dunes in Perdido Key Florida?</h2>
<p>The azure waters of the Gulf of Mexico frame the white beaches. These beaches and their dune habitat host a variety of visitors and residents throughout the year. The beach dune habitat of Perdido Key is characterized by several rows of sand dunes.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-perdido-key-purchased-by-the-national-park-service>When was Perdido Key purchased by the National Park Service?</h2>
<p>In 1978 the National Park Service completed purchase of over 1,000 acres (4.0 km 2) of land on Perdido Key from Johnson Beach to Pensacola Pass for about $8 million. For years this area was called Gulf Beach, and it evolved into being called Perdido Key. Many “old timers” still slip and call the area Gulf Beach.</p>
