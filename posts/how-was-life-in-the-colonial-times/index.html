<h2 id=how-was-life-in-the-colonial-times>How was life in the colonial times?</h2>
<p>Much of colonial life was hard work, even preparing food. But colonists found ways to mix work with play. They also enjoyed sports and games. For most of the 1700s, the colonists were content to be ruled by English laws.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-north-carolina-a-good-colony>Why was North Carolina a good colony?</h2>
<p>The North Carolina Colony landscape included coastal plains, mountain ranges and plateaus. Farming and agriculture were extremely important to the settlers because of the warm climate and vast farmland. The warm weather and lack of cold winters made it much easier for illness to spread and thrive.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-colonial-era-in-north-carolina>What was the colonial era in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Early North Carolina: Colonial Era and Revolutionary War. If you’ve seen a North Carolina license plate recently, you’ve probably noticed the slogan “First in Freedom.” That refers to the Halifax Resolves, the first official cry from a colony, which were adopted in Halifax in April 1776.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-the-colonial-period>What was life like in the colonial period?</h2>
<p>And for most of the colonial period, husbands and wives were far more equal in terms of household management. The rough life of colonial society, especially on the frontier, required that husbands and wives work as a team if they were to sustain their families.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-slaves-in-north-carolina>What was life like for slaves in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Slaves are at the very bottom of the pyramid and they had no rights at all. In the society children had to work and people got married without legal contract. Women couldn’t own any property. The roles of family are similar to today. The man in the family (Father) was the boss of the family.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-society-like-in-north-carolina>What was the society like in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>The people of North Carolina were, in the main, honest and well meaning, and when not goaded by profligate rulers and unjust laws, quiet and peaceable. It is true there were many who had fled from other colonies to escape debts or the hand of the law; but a large portion of society was composed of sturdy, Christian men and women.</p>
