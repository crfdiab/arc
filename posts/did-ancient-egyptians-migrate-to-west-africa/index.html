<h2 id=did-ancient-egyptians-migrate-to-west-africa>Did ancient Egyptians migrate to West Africa?</h2>
<p>Although Lucas did not provide any archaeological evidence, he maintains that it was possible to travel by sea and also by road from Egypt straight to the Sudan and to Nigeria: ‘evidence is available that the transmission of the ancient Egypt[ian] culture followed a trans-continental route from Egypt to the western …</p>
<h2 id=did-the-ancient-egyptians-migrate>Did the ancient Egyptians migrate?</h2>
<p>From 671 BCE, Egypt suffered six invasions by foreigners. Egyptians were particularly influenced by ancient Greece. This is the main reason why Parrinder (1951:200-203) believed that migration between the ancient Egyptians and the Yorubas took place during the predynastic and dynastic periods.</p>
<h2 id=did-yoruba-come-from-egypt>Did Yoruba come from Egypt?</h2>
<p>Although, such historical traditions differ from one school of thought to another, some modern historians of Yoruba descent insist that the Yoruba originated from Egypt.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-yoruba-migrated-from>Where did the Yoruba migrated from?</h2>
<p>The Yoruba have shared a common language and culture for centuries but were probably never a single political unit. They seem to have migrated from the east to their present lands west of the lower Niger River more than a millennium ago.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-people-move-from-east-africa-to-central-nigeria>When did people move from East Africa to central Nigeria?</h2>
<p>Evidence supporting movement from east Africa to central Nigeria between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago was also revealed, through the identification of a substantial amount of east African ancestry in a central Nigerian ethnolinguistic group, the Berom.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-people-migrate-from-west-africa-to>Where did people migrate from West Africa to?</h2>
<p>We sequenced the whole genome of each of these individuals—this means we could read every part of the genome to look for variation. We were able to show that Zambia was most probably an intermediate site on the likely route of migration from West Africa to east and southern Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-people-lived-in-southern-africa>What kind of people lived in southern Africa?</h2>
<p>Before the expansion of farming and pastoralist African peoples, Southern Africa was populated by hunter-gatherers and earlier pastoralists. The Bantu expansion first introduced Bantu peoples to Central, Southern, and Southeast Africa, regions they had previously been absent from.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-nigerians-migrate-to-the-united-states>When did Nigerians migrate to the United States?</h2>
<p>After independence in 1960, this largely highly skilled migration to the United Kingdom continued, although an increasing proportion of Nigerians also migrated to the United States for study, business, and work. As political tensions engulfed Nigeria and as its economy stagnated in the late 1970s and 1980s, the stream of emigrants increased.</p>
