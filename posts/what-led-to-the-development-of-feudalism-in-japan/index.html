<h2 id=what-led-to-the-development-of-feudalism-in-japan>What led to the development of feudalism in Japan?</h2>
<p>Feudalism in Japan developed as the result of the decline in Imperial power and rise of military clans controlled by warlords known as daimyo under…</p>
<h2 id=why-did-europe-and-japan-adopt-feudalism>Why did Europe and Japan adopt feudalism?</h2>
<p>Unable to control the lords of Japan, the emperor lost his political power. A system of feudalism arose in Japan that was similar to feudalism in Western Europe. By 1192, Japan’s most powerful lord or noble had the emperor appoint him as Japan’s “Supreme Military Governor” or Shogun.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-feudalism-impact-japanese-society>How did feudalism impact Japanese society?</h2>
<p>During the feudal age, Japan had very little to no contact at all with other cultures. Social ranks were even more rigid than usual during the feudal period. In feudal times everyone knew their rank. There were 8 or 9 levels in feudal Japanese society, with the royal family and nobles at the top.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-feudal-system-work-in-europe>How did the feudal system work in Europe?</h2>
<p>As Europe continued to flourish, so did its social structure. Feudalism worked by knitting everyone together; when one man gave land (often known as a fief) to another, there was a promise for loyalty during later times. For example, a monarch (usually a king) would own all of the land in his kingdom and often grant some of it to lesser nobles.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-feudalism-differ-from-feudalism-in-japan>How did feudalism differ from feudalism in Japan?</h2>
<p>A key distinguishing factor between the two systems was land ownership. European knights gained land from their lords as payment for their military service; they had direct control of the serfs who worked that land. In contrast, Japanese samurai did not own any land.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-feudal-ruler-in-the-middle-ages>Who was the first feudal ruler in the Middle Ages?</h2>
<p>With virtually no system and an abundance of chaos, the people of former Rome needed a new structure to turn to. And so, feudalism blossomed. During the early days of the medieval time period, things were still falling into place. One of the first rulers of the early Middle Ages was a man named Clovis.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-confucius-have-to-do-with-feudalism>What did Confucius have to do with feudalism?</h2>
<p>Japanese feudalism was based on the ideas of the Chinese philosopher Kong Qiu or Confucius (551–479 BCE). Confucius stressed morality and filial piety, or respect for elders and other superiors. In Japan, it was the moral duty of the daimyo and samurai to protect the peasants and villagers in their region.</p>
