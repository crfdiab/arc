<h2 id=why-did-england-become-a-commonwealth-and-why-they-did-not-remain-a-commonwealth>Why did England become a Commonwealth and why they did not remain a Commonwealth?</h2>
<p>After the execution of Charles I, the House of Commons abolished the monarchy and the House of Lords. It declared the people of England “and of all the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging” to be henceforth under the governance of a “Commonwealth”, effectively a republic.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-commonwealth-end>Why did the Commonwealth end?</h2>
<p>Attempts to have Richard take over from Oliver Cromwell fell foul of the loyalty of the army. It would not be too long before feelers were put out to Charles II to return to England as a stabilising factor and so end the short lived period of the Commonwealth.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-england-stop-being-a-republic>Why did England stop being a republic?</h2>
<p>England in 1649 was a republic, a state that was not ruled by a monarch. The new state was known as the Commonwealth of England. When the Second Civil War ended in 1648, Charles I was put on trial and executed in January 1649. After this, MPs and the army had to decide on a new way for the country to be ruled.</p>
<h2 id=was-the-commonwealth-of-england-a-republic>Was the Commonwealth of England a republic?</h2>
<p>The Commonwealth of England was the republican government which ruled first England and then Ireland and Scotland from 1649 to 1660. After the execution of Charles I on January 30, 1649, the Commonwealth was declared (An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth) by the Rump Parliament on May 19, 1649.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-a-british-republic-be-called>What would a British republic be called?</h2>
<p>‘Commonwealth’ runs the risk of confabulation with the existing, worldwide Commonwealth. So, it would probably be the Republic (possibly the United Republic) of Great Britain & Northern Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-uk-still-part-of-the-british-commonwealth>Is the UK still part of the British Commonwealth?</h2>
<p>It is no longer the British Commonwealth, it is The Commonwealth of Nations as it now includes countries which were never British colonies. The UK is just one of a group of countries which are voluntarily members of the Commonwealth, Britain has no control over the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth has no control over the individual countires</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-british-empire-called-the-commonwealth>Why was the British Empire called the Commonwealth?</h2>
<p>At the 1926 conference Britain and the Dominions agreed that they were all equal members of a community within the British Empire. They all owed allegiance to the British king or queen, but the United Kingdom did not rule over them. This community was called the British Commonwealth of Nations or just the Commonwealth.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-former-british-colonies-not-commonwealth-nations>Why are former British colonies not Commonwealth nations?</h2>
<p>Former British colonies who freed themselves from British rule at the point of a sword aren’t generally the types of countries that you’d think of as being part of a supranational entity which is led by the British monarch.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-british-government-reinvent-the-commonwealth>How did the British government reinvent the Commonwealth?</h2>
<p>In the 1950s, British governments struggled to achieve this post-war imperial vision. They had already reinvented the Commonwealth in 1949 in order to let India remain a republic, overturning the old rule that the British monarch must be head of state in a Commonwealth country.</p>
