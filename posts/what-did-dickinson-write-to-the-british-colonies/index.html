<h2 id=what-did-dickinson-write-to-the-british-colonies>What did Dickinson write to the British colonies?</h2>
<p>Soon after, Dickinson began publishing in the Pennsylvania Chronicle his “Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies” under the pseudonym “Fabius.” The letters advocated peaceful resistance to oppression and warned against revolution as an answer to Britain’s violations.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-william-dickinson-do-at-the-stamp-act-congress>What did William Dickinson do at the Stamp Act Congress?</h2>
<p>Predictably, the colonists met the tax with fierce opposition claiming taxation without representation and organizing boycotts on British goods. Dickinson, with his strong, measured voice, was chosen to represent Pennsylvania at the Stamp Act Congress in 1765, where he drafted the body’s anti–Stamp Act resolution.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-samuel-dickinson-move-his-family-to>Where did Samuel Dickinson move his family to?</h2>
<p>With the help of slave labor, Samuel continued to build on an already prosperous business. In 1740, Samuel moved his second wife, Mary, and their two sons to Kent County, Delaware, leaving the Maryland plantation lands to the surviving children from his first marriage.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-penman-of-the-american-revolution>Who was the Penman of the American Revolution?</h2>
<p>Who Was John Dickinson? John Dickinson was a Founding Father of the United States of America who was known as the “Penman of the Revolution.” He won fame in 1767 as the author of “Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies.”</p>

<h2 id=what-did-the-letters-from-a-farmer-in-pennsylvania-do>What did the letters from a farmer in Pennsylvania do?</h2>
<p>Collectively, the letters were called “Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies.” The letters were shortly thereafter published in pamphlet form and reprinted in almost all of the colonial newspapers. They were read widely across the colonies and in Britain and France.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-dickinson-argue-that-the-townshend-acts-were-illegal>Why did Dickinson argue that the Townshend Acts were illegal?</h2>
<p>In the letters, Dickinson argued, amongst other things, that the Townshend Acts were illegal because they were intended to raise revenue, a power held only by the colonial assemblies. His arguments were a collection of ideas that were written in a clear and concise manner which the general population could understand.</p>
