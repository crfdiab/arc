<h2 id=what-is-the-energy-we-use-today>What is the energy we use today?</h2>
<p>The United States uses a mix of energy sources Primary energy sources include fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, and coal), nuclear energy, and renewable sources of energy. Electricity is a secondary energy source that is generated (produced) from primary energy sources.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-energy-used-for-list-some-examples-of-energy-sources>What is energy used for list some examples of energy sources?</h2>
<p>Different Sources of Energy</p>
<ul>
<li>Solar Energy. The primary source of energy is the sun.</li>
<li>Wind Energy. Wind power is becoming more and more common.</li>
<li>Geothermal Energy. Source: Canva.</li>
<li>Hydrogen Energy.</li>
<li>Tidal Energy.</li>
<li>Wave Energy.</li>
<li>Hydroelectric Energy.</li>
<li>Biomass Energy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-do-you-understand-by-biomass>What do you understand by biomass?</h2>
<p>Biomass is renewable organic material that comes from plants and animals. Biomass contains stored chemical energy from the sun. Plants produce biomass through photosynthesis. Biomass can be burned directly for heat or converted to renewable liquid and gaseous fuels through various processes.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-primary-source-of-energy-for-humans>What is the primary source of energy for humans?</h2>
<p>Carbohydrates<br>
Carbohydrates are the main energy source of the human diet. The metabolic disposal of dietary carbohydrates is direct oxidation in various tissues, glycogen synthesis (in liver and muscles), and hepatic de novo lipogenesis.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-energy-does-the-united-states-use>What kind of energy does the United States use?</h2>
<p>The United States uses a mix of energy sources The United States uses and produces many different types and sources of energy, which can be grouped into general categories such as primary and secondary, renewable and nonrenewable, and fossil fuels.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-example-of-electrical-energy>Which is the best example of electrical energy?</h2>
<p>Electrical energy, which we more commonly refer to as electricity, is caused by the flow of negatively-charged electrons around a circuit. It is the very movement of these electrons that powers our everyday devices. Here are some examples of electrical energy:</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-uses-of-computed-tomography--ct->What are the uses of computed tomography ( CT )?</h2>
<p>CT can also be used to image the head in order to locate injuries, tumors, clots leading to stroke, hemorrhage, and other conditions. It can image the lungs in order to reveal the presence of tumors, pulmonary embolisms (blood clots), excess fluid, and other conditions such as emphysema or pneumonia.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-up-the-total-amount-of-energy-consumed>What makes up the total amount of energy consumed?</h2>
<p>Total energy consumption by the end-use sectors includes their primary energy use, purchased electricity, and electrical system energy losses ( energy conversion and other losses associated with the generation, transmission, and distribution of purchased electricity) and other energy losses.</p>
