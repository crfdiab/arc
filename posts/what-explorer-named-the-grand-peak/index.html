<p>Pikes Peak is the 31st highest peak out of 54 Colorado peaks. It is the farthest east of the big peaks in the Rocky Mountain chain, which contributed to its early fame among explorers, pioneers and immigrants and made it the symbol of the 1859 Gold Rush to Colorado with the slogan, “Pikes Peak or Bust”.</p>
<h2 id=who-explored-colorado-and-discovered-pikes-peak>Who explored Colorado and discovered Pikes Peak?</h2>
<p>Lieutenant Zebulon Pike<br>

<h2 id=has-anyone-died-at-pikes-peak>Has anyone died at Pikes Peak?</h2>

<h2 id=how-did-grays-peak-in-colorado-get-its-name>How did Grays Peak in Colorado get its name?</h2>
