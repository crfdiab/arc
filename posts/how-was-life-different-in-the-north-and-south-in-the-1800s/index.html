<h2 id=how-was-life-different-in-the-north-and-south-in-the-1800s>How was life different in the North and South in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>The North had an industrial economy, an economy focused on manufacturing, while the South had an agricultural economy, an economy focused on farming. Slaves worked on Southern plantations to farm crops, and Northerners would buy these crops to produce goods that they could sell.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-the-south-in-the-1800s>What was life like in the South in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>The population was 9 million people. The South had small farms and big plantations. They grew cotton, tobacco, corn, sugar, and rice. Most slaves lived on big plantations.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-difference-between-north-and-south-in-the-1800s>What was the difference between North and South in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>This was the same case in the 1800s, the difference being that the country was divided into two main parts as it was still growing: the North and the South. Just as each state possesses its own culture and identity, the North and South were distinct in their characteristics, life styles and economy.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-the-north-in-the-1800s>What was life like in the north in the 1800’s?</h2>
<p>Just as each state possesses its own culture and identity, the North and South were distinct in their characteristics, life styles and economy. Firstly, the North was the industrial center of the 19 th century in America, with the latest technologies and transportation systems, such as factories and railroad.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-north-and-south-in-1860>What was the population of North and South in 1860?</h2>
<p>By 1860, the North’s population stood at 23 million compared to the South’s nine million. By contrast, 80 percent of Southerners were employed in agriculture, compared to just 40 percent in the North in 1860. Before and after the Civil War, the North and South were very different in their political alignments.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-immigrants-in-the-north>What was life like for immigrants in the north?</h2>
<p>As previously stated, the North was home to the many cities rooted along the major waterways of the area. These cities however, often times lead to terrible lives for many. The bustling city also had overcrowding which lead to crime and other dreadful things. Some poor immigrants had to spend their days homeless in the streets and begging.</p>
