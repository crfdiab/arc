<h2 id=who-was-allowed-to-vote-for-the-first-time-in-1918>Who was allowed to vote for the first time in 1918?</h2>
<p>The terms of the Act were: All men over 21 gained the vote in the constituency where they were resident. Men who had turned 19 during service in connection with World War I could also vote even if they were under 21, although there was some confusion over whether they could do so after being discharged from service.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-18-year-olds-win-the-right-to-vote>How did 18 year olds win the right to vote?</h2>
<p>In 1970, Senator Ted Kennedy proposed amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to lower the voting age nationally. On June 22, 1970, President Richard Nixon signed an extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required the voting age to be 18 in all federal, state, and local elections.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-us-start-requiring-voter-registration>When did the US start requiring voter registration?</h2>
<p>Throughout the states, voter registries were stalled in legislation in the decades following the creation of the Massachusetts system. Some New England states followed suit, but most did nothing until mass efforts in the north after 1860 made registries seem required.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-voter-registration-after-world-war-1>What was the impact of voter registration after World War 1?</h2>
<p>By World War I, most states had voter registration laws, but the controversies never went away. In 1920, the 14th Amendment allowed states to decide what crimes would allow the loss of voting rights, which, Keysarr says, has been used to purge large segments of the population (mostly black) from the rolls.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-representation-of-the-people-act-1918-important>Why was the Representation of the People Act 1918 important?</h2>
<p>It was called the Representation of the People Act 1918. What was this law? The Representation of the People Act 1918 was an important law because it allowed women to vote for the very first time. It also allowed all men over the age of 21 to vote too. Before this law, women weren’t allowed to vote in general elections at all.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-elected-as-president-of-the-united-states>Who was the first person elected as President of the United States?</h2>
<p>The inauguration of George Washington as the first President of the United States. When George Washington was elected as the first U.S. president in 1789, he won with a landslide, securing 69 out of 69 available electoral votes.</p>
