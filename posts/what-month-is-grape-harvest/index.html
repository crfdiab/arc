<h2 id=what-month-is-grape-harvest>What month is grape harvest?</h2>
<p>The harvest season typically falls between August & October in the Northern Hemisphere and February & April in the Southern Hemisphere. With various climate conditions, grape varieties, and wine styles the harvesting of grapes could happen in every month of the calendar year somewhere in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-time-of-year-are-grapes-ready-to-harvest>What time of year are grapes ready to harvest?</h2>
<p>Harvest/Storage Grapes will not continue ripening once picked from the vine. Test a few to see if they are to your liking before harvesting, usually in late summer or early fall. Grapes are ripe and ready to harvest when they are rich in color, juicy, full-flavored, easily crushed but not shriveled, and plump.</p>

<h2 id=where-do-they-grow-grapes-in-mexico>Where do they grow grapes in Mexico?</h2>
<p>There are three areas in Mexico where wine grapes are grown. The North area includes Baja California and Sonora; the La Laguna area is in Coahuila and Durango and the Center area consists of Zacatecas, Aguascalientes and Querétaro.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-grape-harvest-last>How long does grape harvest last?</h2>
<p>Harvest continues through late October – sometimes early November – for red varieties. It can last until December for late-harvest dessert wines. Although world-renowned, Napa Valley’s wine grape harvest is quite small – just 4% of California’s total annual harvest.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-they-pick-grapes-at-night>Why do they pick grapes at night?</h2>
<p>Increasingly wine grapes are harvested at night. It results in better wine and lower energy costs. Daytime temperatures change the sugar composition of grapes. Picking at night when sugar levels are stable keeps surprises from happening during fermentation.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-water-do-grapes-need>How much water do grapes need?</h2>
<p>Young grapes require about 1/2 to 1 inch of water per week, depending on rainfall, for the first two years during the growing season. When watering young vines, saturate the root zone. Apply 5 gallons of water over a 3 x 3 foot area for 1 inch of water.</p>
<h2 id=can-grapes-ripen-after-they-are-picked>Can grapes ripen after they are picked?</h2>
<p>Grapes, unlike other fruits, do not continue to ripen once off the vine, so it is important to keep tasting until the grapes are uniformly sweet. It is the leaves of the grape that engender the sugars, which are then transferred to the fruit.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-times-a-year-do-grapes-produce>How many times a year do grapes produce?</h2>
<p>Most grape vines will not produce a significant amount of fruit until their third year. Grape vines produce fruit on 1 year old canes (that is, the prior year’s growth). Grape vines produce fruit on 2nd year growth (canes).</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-after-grapes-are-harvested>What happens after grapes are harvested?</h2>
<p>Step 1: Wine grapes are removed from the vine, or “harvested,” and taken to the winery. Step 2: The grapes are crushed and the crushed fruit, called “must,” has yeast and yeast nutrients added. Step 3: The yeast ferments the grape sugars into heat, carbon dioxide and alcohol.</p>
<h2 id=is-wine-cheap-in-mexico>Is wine cheap in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Today Mexico wine production is mainly done in Baja California, Sonora, Zacatecas, Querétaro, and Coahuila. This wine is actually the cheapest wine on our list at $57-60 pesos a bottle. Walmart usually has the cheapest price followed by Mega grocery store.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-harvest-wine-grapes>When is the best time to harvest wine grapes?</h2>
<p>Wine Grape Harvest Time. In general August, September and October mark prime time for the annual grape harvest for most wineries in Europe and North America. Australia, New Zealand, South America, and South Africa, landing decidedly below the equator, typically harvest from February to April.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-mexican-cotton-candy-grapes-come-out>When do Mexican cotton candy grapes come out?</h2>
<p>Totally not true. Mexican Cotton Candy grapes arrive in April with May to mid June being the peak of the supply. You can find them all over the place including Costco. There are a couple growers they do have USDA Certified Organic Cotton Candy grapes. This is the only time of year to find that certification on Cotton Candy grapes.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-know-when-to-pick-grapes>How do you know when to pick grapes?</h2>
<p>Commercial grape growers rely on more scientific methods to determine when to harvest the grapes such as precise pH levels and sugar contents (Brix) that are established with testing. The home grower may make use of the following to ascertain the ripening of grapes and proper harvest time:</p>
<h2 id=where-do-mexicans-eat-grapes-on-new-years-eve>Where do Mexicans eat grapes on New Years Eve?</h2>
<p>New Year’s Eve (or Nochevieja in Spanish) is a sacred time in Mexico. It is at this time that people eat their grapes, usually in one of two places: they are either gathering around the town square to eat grapes, or they are eating grapes on New Year’s Eve in their homes after their family dinner.</p>
