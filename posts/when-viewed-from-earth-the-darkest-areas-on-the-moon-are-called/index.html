<h2 id=when-viewed-from-earth-the-darkest-areas-on-the-moon-are-called>When viewed from Earth the darkest areas on the moon are called?</h2>
<p>The surface of the Moon is covered in huge dark spots, visible from Earth even with the naked eye. These patches are known as maria – a Latin word meaning ‘seas’.</p>
<h2 id=what-moon-is-fully-visible-as-viewed-from-earth>What moon is fully visible as viewed from Earth?</h2>
<p>full moon<br>
A full moon is opposite the sun in its orbit around Earth. Its sunlit side is entirely visible from Earth. The moon appears full to the eye for two to three nights. However, astronomers regard the moon as full at a precisely defined instant, when the moon is exactly 180 degrees opposite the sun in ecliptic longitude.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-the-dark-part-of-the-moon>Can you see the dark part of the moon?</h2>
<p>In all, about 59 percent of the moon is visible from Earth over the course of an orbit. We never ever see 41 percent of the moon – the side that many call “dark.” But the “dark” side of the moon has always, from its perspective, gotten plenty of light. Almost all of them are visible from Earth.</p>
<h2 id=in-which-phase-does-the-moon-appear-dark>In which phase does the moon appear dark?</h2>
<p>Waning Crescent phase<br>
Third Quarter phase occurs when the eastern half of the Moon is illuminated. On that day it rises at midnight and sets at noon. Waning Crescent phase occurs when the eastern edge of the Moon is lit but most of the visible surface is dark.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-moon-zenith>What is a moon Zenith?</h2>
<p>One can say zenith moon as a counterpart to noonday sun, although it is not nearly as common. Note that the astronomical term zenith actually refers to the point directly overhead the observer, not the highest position a celestial object rises over the horizon, which would be its culmination.</p>
<h2 id=what-moon-comes-after-a-full-moon>What Moon comes after a Full Moon?</h2>
<p>The eight phases of the Moon in order are: first quarter Moon. waxing gibbous Moon. full Moon. waning gibbous Moon.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-view-of-the-moon-change-each-night>How does the view of the Moon change each night?</h2>
<p>On Earth, our view of the illuminated part of the Moon changes each night, depending on where the Moon is in its orbit, or path, around Earth. When we have a full view of the completely illuminated side of the Moon, that phase is known as a full moon.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-far-side-of-the-moon-look-like>What does the far side of the Moon look like?</h2>
<p>At that point, the far side of the Moon is facing the Sun. This phase is called a new moon. During the new moon, the side facing Earth is dark. ? New: We cannot see the Moon when it is a new moon. ? Waxing Crescent: In the Northern Hemisphere, we see the waxing crescent phase as a thin crescent of light on the right.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-moon-look-like-in-the-night-sky>What does the Moon look like in the night sky?</h2>
<p>We describe how the Moon looks with the eight Moon phases, or shapes: If you have looked into the night sky, you may have noticed the Moon appears to change shape each night. Some nights, the Moon might look like a narrow crescent. Other nights, the Moon might look like a bright circle.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-brightest-phase-of-the-moon>Which is the brightest phase of the Moon?</h2>
<p>Full Moon is the brightest phase. The Full Moon appears in the night sky when the Sun and the Moon are aligned on opposite sides of Earth. How can Full Moon be in the daytime?</p>
