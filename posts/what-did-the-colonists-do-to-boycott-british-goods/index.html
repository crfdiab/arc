<h2 id=what-did-the-colonists-do-to-boycott-british-goods>What did the colonists do to boycott British goods?</h2>
<p>The colonists started to resist by boycotting, or not buying, British goods. In 1773 some colonists in Boston, Massachusetts demonstrated their frustration by dressing up like Indians, sneaking onto ships in the harbor, and dumping imported tea into the water. This was called the Boston Tea Party.</p>
<h2 id=did-colonists-boycott-british-goods-in-the-stamp-act>Did colonists boycott British goods in the Stamp Act?</h2>
<p>The colonists, who had convened the Stamp Act Congress in October 1765 to vocalize their opposition to the impending enactment, greeted the arrival of the stamps with outrage and violence. Most Americans called for a boycott of British goods, and some organized attacks on the customhouses and homes of tax collectors.</p>
<h2 id=what-colonists-boycott-acts>What colonists boycott acts?</h2>
<p>Riotous protest of the Townshend Acts in the colonies often invoked the phrase no taxation without representation. Colonists eventually decided not to import British goods until the act was repealed and to boycott any goods that were imported in violation of their non-importation agreement.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-colonists-boycott-goods>Did the colonists boycott goods?</h2>
<p>All of the colonies organized boycott committees. With the encouragement of the Sons of Liberty colonial merchants began boycotting British goods. This effectively cut the American purchases from England by half, seriously effecting British merchants.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonist-boycott-goods-from-england>Why did the colonist boycott goods from England?</h2>
<p>With the encouragement of the Sons of Liberty colonial merchants began boycotting British goods. This effectively cut the American purchases from England by half, seriously effecting British merchants. Between the economic and political boycotts the colonists had become united, as never before, in opposition to the British actions.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-colonists-protest-against-the-british>How did the colonists protest against the British?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, it was not the political protest that had the most effect on the British, but it was the boycotts by the colonists. All of the colonies organized boycott committees. With the encouragement of the Sons of Liberty colonial merchants began boycotting British goods.</p>

<h2 id=why-did-the-colonists-oppose-the-stamp-act>Why did the colonists oppose the Stamp Act?</h2>
<p>The American colonists were angered by the Stamp Act and quickly acted to oppose it. Because of the colonies’ sheer distance from London, the epicenter of British politics, a direct appeal to Parliament was almost impossible. Instead, the colonists made clear their opposition by simply refusing to pay the tax.</p>
