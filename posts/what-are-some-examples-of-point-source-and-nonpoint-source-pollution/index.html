<p>Nonpoint-source pollution is the opposite of point-source pollution, with pollutants released in a wide area. As an example, picture a city street during a thunderstorm. As rainwater flows over asphalt, it washes away drops of oil that leaked from car engines, particles of tire rubber, dog waste, and trash.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-examples-that-are-considered-point-source-pollution>What are 3 examples that are considered point source pollution?</h2>
<p>Factories and sewage treatment plants are two common types of point sources. Factories, including oil refineries, pulp and paper mills, and chemical, electronics and automobile manufacturers, typically discharge one or more pollutants in their discharged waters (called effluents).</p>
<h2 id=is-oil-a-point-source-pollution>Is oil a point source pollution?</h2>
<p>Oil spills and dumping also play a major role in point source pollution. Spilled grease, oil, and other hazardous substances from overturned trucks and leaking cars have a major impact by eventually running into rivers and sewers.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-example-of-non-point-pollution>What is an example of non-point pollution?</h2>
<p>Nonpoint source pollution can include: Excess fertilizers, herbicides and insecticides from agricultural lands and residential areas. Oil, grease and toxic chemicals from urban runoff and energy production. Sediment from improperly managed construction sites, crop and forest lands, and eroding streambanks.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-point-and-nonpoint-source-pollution>What is the difference between Point and nonpoint source pollution?</h2>
<p>Nonpoint Source Pollution. Nonpoint source pollution is a combination of pollutants from a large area rather than from specific identifiable sources such as discharge pipes. Runoff is generally associated with nonpoint source pollution, as water is emptied into streams or rivers after accumulating contaminants from sources like gardens,…</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-main-point-source-of-pollution>Which is the main point source of pollution?</h2>
<p>The main point source dischargers are factories and sewage treatment plants, which release treated wastewater. Nonpoint Source Pollution Nonpoint source pollution is a combination of pollutants from a large area rather than from specific identifiable sources such as discharge pipes.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-nonpoint-source-mean-in-the-clean-water-act>What does nonpoint source mean in the Clean Water Act?</h2>
<p>However, we know that these pollutants have harmful effects on drinking water supplies, recreation, fisheries and wildlife. The term “nonpoint source” is defined to mean any source of water pollution that does not meet the legal definition of “point source” in section 502 (14) of the Clean Water Act:</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-example-of-a-point-source>Which is the best example of a point source?</h2>
<p>Point sources release pollutants from discrete conveyances, such as a discharge pipe, and are regulated by federal and state agencies. The main point source dischargers are factories and sewage treatment plants, which release treated wastewater. Nonpoint Source Pollution.</p>
