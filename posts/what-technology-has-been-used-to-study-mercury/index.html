<h2 id=what-technology-has-been-used-to-study-mercury>What technology has been used to study Mercury?</h2>
<p>The first was Mariner 10, a spacecraft meant to study both Venus and Mercury. It flew by Mercury three times in 1974 and 1975. Then, in 2004, NASA launched the MESSENGER spacecraft, which successfully inserted itself into Mercury’s orbit in 2011.</p>
<h2 id=how-has-mercury-been-studied>How has Mercury been studied?</h2>
<p>Two spacecraft have visited the planet Mercury so far. The first was called Mariner 10. During 1974 and 1975, Mariner 10 flew by Mercury three times and mapped about half of the planet’s surface. Mariner 10 also discovered Mercury’s thin atmosphere and detected its magnetic field.</p>
<h2 id=what-new-technology-would-you-need-to-be-able-to-live-on-mercury>What new technology would you need to be able to live on Mercury?</h2>
<p>In the case of Mercury, this would include pumping in a breathable atmosphere, and then melting the ice to create water vapor and natural irrigation. Eventually, the region inside the dome would become a livable habitat, complete with its own water cycle and carbon cycle.</p>
<h2 id=what-space-technology-has-been-used-to-acquire-information-about-mercury>What space technology has been used to acquire information about Mercury?</h2>
<p>NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft orbited Mercury for more than four years. Among its accomplishments, the mission determined Mercury’s surface composition, revealed its geological history, discovered details about its internal magnetic field, and verified its polar deposits are dominantly water-ice.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-mercury-first-used-in-scientific-research>When was Mercury first used in scientific research?</h2>
<p>Mercury was used in scientific research largely as a result of Torricelli’s 1643 invention of the barometer and Fahrenheit’s 1720 invention of the mercury thermometer.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-new-technologies-for-mercury-remediation>Are there any new technologies for mercury remediation?</h2>
<p>More recent research have been ongoing to develop novel materials and technologies for Hg remediation (Ali et al., 2018, Chen et al., 2018c, Huang et al., 2019b, Moharem et al., 2019, Wang et al.]</p>
<h2 id=how-is-mercury-used-in-products-and-processes>How is mercury used in products and processes?</h2>
<p>History Of Mercury Use in Products and Processes. By the early 1900s, the main uses of mercury were in making scientific equipment, recovering gold and silver, manufacturing fulminate and vermilion, and felt-making. Of note, individuals who made felt hats displayed signs of dementia as a result of mercury poisoning.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-nanomaterials-are-used-to-remove-mercury>What kind of nanomaterials are used to remove mercury?</h2>
<p>Extensive research on various nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), nanosheets and magnetic nanocomposites, for mercury removal are investigated.</p>
