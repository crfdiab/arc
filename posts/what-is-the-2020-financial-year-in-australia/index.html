<h2 id=what-is-the-2020-financial-year-in-australia>What is the 2020 financial year in Australia?</h2>
<p>The Australian Tax Office (ATO) collects income tax from working Australians each financial year. In Australia, financial years run from 1 July to 30 June of the following year, so we are currently in the 2021-22 financial year (1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022).</p>
<h2 id=what-month-is-the-end-of-the-financial-year-2020>What month is the end of the financial year 2020?</h2>
<p>30 June 2020<br>
For example, the current financial year 2020 is the 12-month period starting on 1 July 2019 and ending on 30 June 2020, and is often referred to as FY2019/20. The next FY will begin on 1 July 2020 and will end on 30 June 2021 and will be referred to as the 2020/21 FY.</p>
<h2 id=which-month-will-the-company-financial-year-end-be>Which month will the company financial year end be?</h2>
<p>February<br>
Most Company has their financial year end on the 28th February each year, so their financial year starts on the 1st March of each year. The financial year end date must be set out in the Company’s Notice of Incorporation.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-weeks-is-a-financial-year-australia>How many weeks is a financial year Australia?</h2>
<p>27 Fortnights or 53 Weeks – Check Tax and Super. ATO default calculations for withholding tax are based on 52 weeks or 26 fortnights. In some financial years, some employees may receive an extra pay which may affect tax and super. Tax is withheld according to the ATO calculation of $425 per week.</p>

<p>IRS Income Tax Forms, Schedules and Publications for Tax Year 2020 – January 1 – December 31, 2020. 2020 Tax Returns are due on April 15, 2021. The tax forms and schedules listed here are for the 2020 Tax Year tax returns and they can be e-filed via eFile.com between early January 2021 and October 15, 2021.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-fy-2020-mean>What does FY 2020 mean?</h2>
<p>fiscal year<br>
For example, to reference a nonprofit organization’s fiscal year-end, you may say, “FY 2020” or “fiscal year ending Jun 30, 2020.” Similarly, if you referred to government spending that occurred on Nov 15, 2019, you would label that as an expenditure for the fiscal year 2020.</p>
<h2 id=what-date-is-2020-financial-year>What date is 2020 financial year?</h2>
<p>5 May 2021 If you’re an individual and used a registered tax agent to help lodge your annual tax return for the fiscal year 2020 (1 July 2019 – 30 June 2020), this is typically the deadline they will adhere to for the submission of your return.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-end-of-the-financial-year-in-australia>When is the end of the financial year in Australia?</h2>
<p>When is the start and end of financial year? 1 July 2020 A new fiscal year begins today. 30 June 2021 This marks the end of the fiscal year in Australia.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-end-of-financial-year-bas-due>When is the end of financial year BAS due?</h2>
<p>Know your deadlines. There are key dates Tom has in his calendar that apply to small businesses. June 30 – End of financial year. July 28 – Q4 BAS is due. October 31 – Tax return is due. (Step 4.) Lodge your Tax return</p>
<h2 id=when-does-tax-season-start-and-end-in-australia>When does tax season start and end in Australia?</h2>
<p>However, unlike countries such as the US where tax season is essentially year-round, Australia’s only really runs from the 1 July – 31 October if you’re an individual (if you’re a business, you’re less lucky, and have to submit monthly and quarterly activity statements all year round).</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-3rd-quarter-of-the-fiscal-year-end>When does the 3rd quarter of the fiscal year end?</h2>
<p>3rd quarter: 1 April 2021 – 30 June 2021; 4th quarter: 1 July 2021 – 30 September 2021; State governments. State governments set their own fiscal year. Forty-six of the fifty states set their fiscal year to end on 30 June. Four states have fiscal years that end on a different date: Alabama, ends 30 September; Michigan, ends 30 September</p>
