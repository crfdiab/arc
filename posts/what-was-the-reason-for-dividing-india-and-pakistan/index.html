<h2 id=what-was-the-reason-for-dividing-india-and-pakistan>What was the reason for dividing India and Pakistan?</h2>
<p>The partition was caused in part by the two-nation theory presented by Syed Ahmed Khan, due to presented religious issues. Pakistan became a Muslim country, and India became a majority Hindu but secular country. The main spokesperson for the partition was Muhammad Ali Jinnah.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-responsible-for-the-partition-of-india>What was responsible for the partition of India?</h2>
<p>Markandey Katju views the British as bearing responsibility for the partition of India; he regards Jinnah as a British agent who advocated for the creation of Pakistan in order “to satisfy his ambition to become the ‘Quaid-e-Azam’, regardless of the suffering his actions caused to both Hindus and Muslims.” Katju …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-ongoing-conflict-between-pakistan-and-india>What is the ongoing conflict between Pakistan and India?</h2>
<p>The disputed status of Kashmir has been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan since the first Indo-Pakistan war in 1947. In particular, since 2013 ceasefire violations and border skirmishes have increased. Therefore, the two countries continue to be involved in an international armed conflict.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-partition-of-india-happen-in-1947>Why did the partition of India happen in 1947?</h2>
<p>Listen Now The Partition of India in 1947 is one of the great forgotten tragedies of the 20th century. It occurred when India became independent from the British Empire and the territory was broken into India and Pakistan.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-india-divided-into-pakistan-and-india>Why was India divided into Pakistan and India?</h2>
<p>The decision to create two separate countries was sparked by the end of British rule in India. It was decided that to limit violence and bloodshed between Hindus and Muslims, the country would be split into two completely separate countries. The majority of the Hindu population would remain within India while Pakistan would contain mostly Muslims.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-partition-of-pakistan-affect-pakistan>How did the partition of Pakistan affect Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Another unforeseen consequence of Partition was that Pakistan’s population ended up more religiously homogeneous than originally anticipated.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-muslim-league-want-to-partition-india>Why did the Muslim League want to partition India?</h2>
<p>In March 1940, the Muslim League’s “Pakistan” resolution called for the creation of “separate states” – plural, not singular – to accommodate Indian Muslims, whom it argued were a separate “nation”. Historians are still divided on whether this rather vague demand was purely a bargaining counter or a firm objective.</p>
