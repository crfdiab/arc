<h2 id=why-were-heavy-cavalry-so-effective>Why were heavy cavalry so effective?</h2>
<p>For much of history, humans have used some form of cavalry for war and, as a result, cavalry tactics have evolved over time. Tactically, the main advantages of cavalry over infantry troops were greater mobility, a larger impact, and a higher position.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-cavalry-start>When did cavalry start?</h2>
<p>400 ce–1350. The beginning of the age of cavalry in Europe is traditionally dated to the destruction of the legions of the Roman emperor Valens by Gothic horsemen at the Battle of Adrianople in 378 ce.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-light-cavalry-vs-heavy-cavalry>What is light cavalry vs heavy cavalry?</h2>
<p>Light cavalry comprises lightly armed and armored cavalry troops mounted on fast horses, as opposed to heavy cavalry, where the mounted riders (and sometimes the warhorses) are heavily armored. With the decline of feudalism and knighthood in Europe, light cavalry became more prominent in the armies of the continent.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-heavy-cavalry-used-for>What was heavy cavalry used for?</h2>
<p>Mounted warfare Cavalry soldiers on large, heavy and strong horses were used to break enemy formations. Some cavalry, and later mounted infantry, also gave commanders mobile firepower on the battlefield.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-beat-heavy-cavalry>How do you beat heavy cavalry?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fight them in terrain which favours your type of troops. If yours are heavy foot, fight them in broken and rocky terrain. If yours are light foot, fight them in woods or marshland.</li>
<li>Get your own heavy cavalry to neutralize them. Use combined arms tactics if possible.</li>
<li>Arrange a tarpit unit to bind t.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-has-replaced-the-cavalry-by-ww2>What has replaced the cavalry by ww2?</h2>
<p>The last cavalry charge made on horseback by the U.S. Army took place in 1942, when the United States fought the Japanese army in the Philippines. After that, the mounted cavalry was replaced by tanks.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-greatest-cavalry-charge-in-history>What was the greatest cavalry charge in history?</h2>
<p>Sobieski’s greatest military victory came when he led the joint forces of Poland and the Holy Roman Empire at Vienna in 1683, when the Turks were on the point of taking the city. The crucial assault led by the Polish king, involving 20,000 horsemen, is described as the largest cavalry charge in history.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-largest-cavalry-charge-in-history>What was the largest cavalry charge in history?</h2>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-frankish-cavalry>What was the name of the Frankish cavalry?</h2>
<p>The famed Carolingian Frankish cavalry (caballarii) is a somewhat controversial subject in military history. In essence, many 19th century historians perceived these armored horsemen of the thriving Frankish Empire as the ‘prototypes’ to the later medieval knights.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-heavy-cavalry-of-ancient-europe-come-from>Where did the heavy cavalry of ancient Europe come from?</h2>
<p>The small size of Celtic horses meant that the Celtic heavy cavalry of north-western and central Europe appear to have been employed as heavy skirmisher cavalry, rather than the shock cavalry of the Middle East and North Africa, the heavy cavalry of Gaul and Celtiberia being widely regarded as some of the finest horsemen of the ancient world.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-the-franks-in-the-middle-ages>What was the role of the Franks in the Middle Ages?</h2>
<p>The Franks were a group of Germanic tribes that played a key role in the history of Europe during the Middle Ages. After the Roman Empire disintegrated, Frankish dynasties gradually gained control of most of Europe.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-knights-do-in-the-frankish-army>What did the Knights do in the Frankish army?</h2>
<p>Frankish Knight One of the most powerful units of the Frankish army was the heavily armored cavalry. These soldiers became known as knights. Because metal armor and war horses were so expensive, only the very wealthy could afford to become knights. Knights were often awarded land for their services at war. This helped to develop the feudal system.</p>
