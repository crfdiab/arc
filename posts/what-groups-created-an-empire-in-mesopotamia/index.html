<h2 id=what-groups-created-an-empire-in-mesopotamia>What groups created an empire in Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>Groups like the Akkadians first conquer and then rule other lands. In this chapter, you will learn about four empires that rose up in Mesopotamia between 2300 and 539 B.C.E. They were the Akkadian Empire, the Babylonian (bah-buh-LOH-nyuhn) Empire, the Assyrian (uh-SIR-ee-un) Empire, and the Neo-Babylonian Empire.</p>
<h2 id=what-helped-the-mesopotamian-society-grow>What helped the Mesopotamian society grow?</h2>
<p>The presence of those rivers had a lot to do with why Mesopotamia developed complex societies and innovations such as writing, elaborate architecture and government bureaucracies. The regular flooding along the Tigris and the Euphrates made the land around them especially fertile and ideal for growing crops for food.</p>
<h2 id=what-led-to-the-rise-of-most-mesopotamian-empires>What led to the rise of most Mesopotamian empires?</h2>
<p>With the wealth that came from Agriculture, city states were formed that then became empires that would vie for control. A lot of the time, these empires were established due to the emergence of a young all-powerful ruler who would unite the empire by conquest.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-assyrians-rise-to-power-in-mesopotamia>When did the Assyrians rise to power in Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>Assyria lay to the north of Babylon. The Assyrians had lived in Mesopotamia for a long time, briefly establishing their own empire before Hammurabi conquered them. They rose to power again toward 900 B.C.E., when a series of Assyrian rulers began training an army for war in hopes of expanding their territory.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-first-empire-in-mesopotamia>What was the name of the First Empire in Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>1 Akkadian Empire. The first empire that we will look at isn’t just the first empire in Mesopotamia, but is also the first empire in the entire world! 2 Babylonian Empire. However, the Akkadian Empire not only united dozens of city-states, but also two very different Mesopotamian cultures. 3 Assyrian Empire. …</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-culture-did-the-mesopotamians-have>What kind of culture did the Mesopotamians have?</h2>
<p>Mesopotamia was not the first society with a distinct culture. The people of the European Upper Palaeolithic produced exquisite artwork such as painted caves, carved Venus figurines , and personal ornamentation such as pierced ivory beads.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-akkadian-empire-different-from-other-empires>Why was the Akkadian Empire different from other empires?</h2>
<p>However, the Akkadian Empire not only united dozens of city-states, but also two very different Mesopotamian cultures. Northern Mesopotamia had mountains and rain, whereas the south was more desert. This difference in climate meant that the two regions developed different cultures, and these were in conflict with each other.</p>
