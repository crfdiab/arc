<h2 id=does-kale-grow-in-israel>Does Kale grow in Israel?</h2>
<p>Kale has been grown locally in the last three years and is sold for some 12 shekels a piece in most supermarkets year-round. “Kale won’t turn into a trend in Israel because people aren’t going to eat a bitter leaf,” says Noam Yaakoba, a farmer of moshav Nir Banim.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-kale-do-for-the-body>What does Kale do for the body?</h2>
<p>Kale contains fiber, antioxidants, calcium, vitamins C and K, iron, and a wide range of other nutrients that can help prevent various health problems. Antioxidants help the body remove unwanted toxins that result from natural processes and environmental pressures.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fruit-grows-in-israel>What kind of fruit grows in Israel?</h2>
<p>More than forty types of fruit are grown in Israel. In addition to citrus, these include avocados, bananas, apples, cherries, plums, nectarines, grapes, dates, strawberries, prickly pear (tzabbar), persimmon, loquat and pomegranates. Israel is the second leading producer of loquat after Japan.</p>
<h2 id=is-kale-bad-for-thyroid>Is kale bad for thyroid?</h2>
<p>Myth No. 1: You can’t eat cruciferous vegetables if you have a thyroid disorder. Cruciferous vegetables, which include broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and kale, have been thought to interfere with how your thyroid uses iodine. Iodine plays a role in hormone production in the thyroid gland.</p>
<h2 id=is-kale-healthier-raw-or-cooked>Is kale healthier raw or cooked?</h2>
<p>“Cancer studies seem to show that raw kale is more beneficial than cooked, while cholesterol studies seem to show that steamed kale is more beneficial than raw,” says Harris, who recommends a bit of both in your diet. But whatever you do, don’t boil, saute or stir-fry the veggie too long or with too much added liquid.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-ok-to-eat-kale-everyday>Is it OK to eat kale everyday?</h2>
<p>Kale is one of the healthiest foods on the planet due to its high concentration of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Despite being high in goitrins, research shows that a moderate intake of raw kale is unlikely to affect your thyroid health. Plus, raw kale may be more nutritious than cooked varieties.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-sea-kale-in-the-uk>Where can I find sea kale in the UK?</h2>
<p>Sea kale fell out of favour, but in the early 21st century, British chefs made it fashionable again. It is commercially grown by a number of farmers in Britain. A tiny experimental plot of sea kale is cultivated on Texel, a North Sea island in the Netherlands. It is irrigated with adulterated seawater.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-vegetable-is-kale-used-for>What kind of vegetable is Kale used for?</h2>
<p>Kale may also be referred to as borecole or non-heading cabbage or broccoli and its exact origins are unknown, although it grows native in regions of the eastern Mediterranean and Asia. Kale is used as a green vegetable and is usually cooked before consumption.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-good-to-grow-kale-in-garden>Is it good to grow Kale in Garden?</h2>
<p>Ideal for successive cutting it keeps on producing tender leaves for months on end. Not only is Kale a tasty vegetable with a long cropping season but it is a very attractive vegetable as well. Many gardeners grow them in their borders purely for their ornamental value, especially over winter.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-harvest-kale>When is the best time to harvest Kale?</h2>
<p>Harvesting Kale leaves can be harvested when they are 20–25 cm (8–10 in) long. Harvest the outer leaves to avoid damaging the growing tip of the plant. Kale leaves are sweeter when they are harvested after frost.</p>
