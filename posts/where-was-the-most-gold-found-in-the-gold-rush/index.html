<p>the Welcome Stranger<br>
Considered by most authorities to be the biggest gold nugget ever found, the Welcome Stranger was found at Moliagul, Victoria, Australia in 1869 by John Deason and Richard Oates. It weighed gross, over 2,520 troy ounces (78 kg; 173 lb) and returned over 2,284 troy ounces (71.0 kg; 156.6 lb) net.</p>

<p>Within a few years, the little port of San Francisco became a raucous frontier metropolis with a lively economy and California was named the 31st state. An astounding amount of gold was pulled from the ground: $10 million in 1849, $41 million ($971 million in 2005 dollars) in 1850, $75 million in 1851, and $81 million in 1852.</p>

<h2 id=which-is-the-most-gold-rich-state-in-the-united-states>Which is the most gold rich state in the United States?</h2>
<p>It is no secret that California is the most gold rich state in the U.S. Ever since the first discovery of gold at Sutter’s Mill in 1848, there have been thousands upon thousands of gold seekers coming to California in search of riches. Of course it is the famous “Mother Lode” region of northern California that is best-known for gold.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-lot-of-gold-in-california>Is there a lot of gold in California?</h2>
<p>A spectacular amount of gold has been found in California over the years, and despite environmental restrictions that have been put in place over the recent years, there is still plenty of gold being found. Basic prospecting equipment like gold pans, sluice boxes, and highbanker can be used to recover placer deposits from creeks and rivers.</p>
