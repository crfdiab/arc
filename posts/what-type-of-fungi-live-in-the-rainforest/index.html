<h2 id=what-type-of-fungi-live-in-the-rainforest>What type of fungi live in the rainforest?</h2>
<p>The diversity of macrofungi in tropical forests showed that the highest diversity in the Neotropics occurred in the Amazon Basin with Agaricomycetes, Pyrenomycetes, Xylariaceous, and Hyphomycetous fungi being most species-rich.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-types-of-fungi-on-the-rain-forest-floor>Why are there so many types of fungi on the rain forest floor?</h2>
<p>Fungi can grow in dark, humid places that get little sunlight. Fungi are not eaten by many consumers, so they grow in great numbers. Fungi do not need much water, so they grow well on the rainforest floor.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-fungi-in-a-rainforest>What happens to the fungi in a rainforest?</h2>
<p>However, mushrooms and fungi are critical to life on earth, especially in the rainforests. Fungi invade wood and soil and break them down into nutrients so that they can be reused by other plants and animals.</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-eat-fungus>What animals eat fungus?</h2>
<p>Mammals. Many mammals eat fungi, but only a few feed exclusively on fungi; most are opportunistic feeders and fungi only make up part of their diet. At least 22 species of primate, including humans, bonobos, colobines, gorillas, lemurs, macaques, mangabeys, marmosets and vervet monkeys are known to feed on fungi.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fungi-have-pictures-on-them>What kind of fungi have pictures on them?</h2>
<p>Let me introduced you to some of the strange Fungi which are different types of fungi with pictures. 1. Bear’s Head Tooth Mushroom 2. Bioluminescent Fungi 3. Black Jelly Roll 4. Bleeding Tooth Fungus 5. Chicken of the Woods 6. Clathrus Columnatus, also known as the Column Stinkhorn 7.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fungi-grow-in-the-gulf-coast>What kind of fungi grow in the Gulf Coast?</h2>
<p>The fungi are a member of Phallaceae. These fungi are common across the Gulf Coast where they can appear occasionally. These kinds of fungi grow alone sometimes together closely to woody pieces, gardens, cultivated soil, and lawns. 7. Cogumelo Mushroom Cogumelo Mushroom is the kingdom of Fungi and the members of Agaricales.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fungi-are-in-the-red-cage>What kind of fungi are in the red cage?</h2>
<p>You can see different types of fungi with pictures but the Red Cage is the fungi of the Stinkhorn family. They mainly grow on the dead body and rots in the deep forest. 13.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fungus-grows-on-rotting-wood>What kind of fungus grows on rotting wood?</h2>
<p>Cannonball fungus (Sphaerobolus) Grow on rotting wood in many of the same places as bird’s nest fungi. The whitish or yellowish-pink immature fruiting bodies are round balls similar to immature bird’s nest fungi. As the fruiting bodies mature, the outer layer of the ball peels back to form a cup with a single round peridiole inside.</p>
