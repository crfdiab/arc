<p>In 1497 an Italian called Giovanni Caboto (called John Cabot in England) landed in North America. Further European discoveries were made by the Portuguese Pedro Cabral, who landed in Brazil in 1500 and by Giovanni da Verrazano, who explored the east coast of North America in the 1520s.</p>

<p>Around 1519–1521, Portuguese explorer João Álvares Fagundes explored the coasts of Newfoundland, Labrador and Nova Scotia, with a mission to create colonies. In 1521, Juan Ponce de León attempted to establish a permanent settlement on the west coast of Florida. The landing place has not been determined.</p>
<h2 id=which-nation-explored-north-america-first>Which nation explored North America first?</h2>
<p>Five hundred years before Columbus, a daring band of Vikings led by Leif Eriksson set foot in North America and established a settlement. And long before that, some scholars say, the Americas seem to have been visited by seafaring travelers from China, and possibly by visitors from Africa and even Ice Age Europe.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-happening-in-north-america-in-the-1500s>What was happening in North America in the 1500s?</h2>
<p>During the 1500’s, the Spanish and Portuguese spread out over the southern part of the Western Hemisphere in search of gold and other riches. The Spaniards quickly conquered the Inca of Peru, the Maya of Central America, and the Aztec of Mexico. The Portuguese took control of what is now Brazil.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-spanish-explorer-to-explore-north-america>Who was the first Spanish explorer to explore North America?</h2>
<p>In 1507 Waldseemüller published a book in which he named the new land “America.” More Spanish expeditions followed. Juan Ponce de León explored the coasts of Florida in 1513. Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama and discovered the Pacific Ocean in the same year.</p>

<p>Trade continued to revolve around the Mediterranean Sea, as it had for hundreds of years. Between 1000 and 1650, a series of interconnected developments occurred in Europe that provided the impetus for the exploration and subsequent colonization of America.</p>
