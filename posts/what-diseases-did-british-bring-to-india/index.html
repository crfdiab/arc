<h2 id=what-diseases-did-british-bring-to-india>What diseases did British bring to India?</h2>
<p>Epidemic diseases that had devastating effects during that period were plague, leprosy, cholera, and malaria.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-did-the-british-empire-influence>What countries did the British Empire influence?</h2>
<p>What was the British Empire? The British Empire is a term used to describe all the places around the world that were once ruled by Britain. Built over many years, it grew to include large areas of North America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia and Africa, as well as small parts of Central and South America, too.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-social-impact-of-british-rule>What was the social impact of British rule?</h2>
<p>In the social sphere British impact proved to be beneficial. The prohibition of Sati, abolition of child-marriage, introduction of widow remarriage, checking of infanticide, polygamy, untouchabihty etc. eradicated age old social evils from the Indian society.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-british-empire-bring-to-the-world>What did the British Empire bring to the world?</h2>
<p>Democracy in the modern world was developed in Britain and France, and during the Age of Empires they spread it across the world. The British Empire brought democracy to countries across all continents, including the US, India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Pakistan, the United Kingdom itself, and many more.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-problem-with-the-british-empire>What was the problem with the British Empire?</h2>
<p>The problem with the question is of course that the ‘British Empire’ was not like a shirt that can be put on, considered and taken off if it doesn’t fit. Or like Windows 10, which was almost cool, but in the end wasn’t.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-countries-did-the-british-empire-invade>How many countries did the British Empire invade?</h2>
<p>It has also held a portion of the present day United States and China. Over the course of Britain’s existence, the country has invaded nine out of 10 of the world’s countries, or all but 22 of them in total.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-british-empire-leave-most-of-its-colonies>Where did the British Empire leave most of its colonies?</h2>
<p>In Africa, the world’s poorest continent, five of the richest 10 countries—Egypt, Sudan, South Africa, Ghana, and Nigeria—are former British colonies, which at least means that the Empire left its colonies in a better state than other European powers.</p>
