<p>The primary exports from the colony were products of the forest. By the 1720s naval stores, including turpentine, rosin, tar, and pitch (used for painting, caulking, and preservation of wood and rope), became valuable exports highly sought after by the Royal Navy and the British merchant fleet.</p>

<p>Tobacco and rice crops were important to the English colonies in the south of North America. The cultivation of those crops shaped those colonies because they brought slavery, aristocratic. Making it hard to develop schools, cities, and churches (expansive land).</p>

<h2 id=what-was-south-carolinas-most-important-crop>What was South Carolina’s most important crop?</h2>
<p>In South Carolina and Georgia, the main cash crops were indigo and rice. The cash crops grown in each colony depended on which crop grew best in that colonies’ type of soil.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-idea-for-starting-the-colonies-in-america>What was the main idea for starting the colonies in America?</h2>
<p>As a result, for the most part, the English colonies in North America were business ventures. They provided an outlet for England’s surplus population and (in some cases) more religious freedom than England did, but their primary purpose was to make money for their sponsors.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-second-most-valuable-export-in-south-carolina>What was the second most valuable export in South Carolina?</h2>
<p>During that period, indigo (or, more specifically, indigo dyestuff) was South Carolina’s second most valuable export, behind rice. The cultivation and production of indigo also involved the labor of thousands—perhaps tens of thousands—of people in the South Carolina Lowcountry.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-economy-of-south-carolina-in-the-1920s>What was the economy of South Carolina in the 1920s?</h2>
<p>During the first half of the 20th century, agriculture was the key to the state’s economy, but by the early 1920s the value of manufactured goods had exceeded that of agricultural products. Although agriculture continues to be important, it has played a diminishing role as employment in the manufacturing and service sectors has increased.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-rice-plantations-affect-charleston-south-carolina>How did the rice plantations affect Charleston South Carolina?</h2>
<p>Rice plantations shaped and reshaped the lowcountry geography and economy, making Charleston one of the richest cities in the world, but it was a wealth built primarily on slave labor. With rough tools, slaves cleared immense wooded swamps.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-south-carolina-export-indigo-to-england>Why did South Carolina export indigo to England?</h2>
<p>The large-scale, commercial exportation of indigo dyestuff from South Carolina to England commenced in 1747, following a revival of interest in the crop. The principal motivation behind this revival was an economic decline caused by a decade of war with Spain and France (the “War of Jenkins’ Ear” and “King George’s War,” 1739–48).</p>
