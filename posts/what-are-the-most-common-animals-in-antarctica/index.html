<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-whale-in-the-antarctic>Which is the largest whale in the Antarctic?</h2>
<p>The three largest whales in the Antarctic are not only the biggest animals in Antarctica, they actually hold the title of the the three largest living animals in the world! The Humpback whale is the most common whale in the Antarctic.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-animals-that-are-endangered-in-antarctica>Are there any animals that are endangered in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>According to the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), there are several animals in danger of extinction in Antarctica. The Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia)is a critically a endangered Antarctic species that has decreased 97% from 1926. Additional Antarctic endangered animals include:</p>
<h2 id=how-many-species-of-penguins-are-there-in-antarctica>How many species of penguins are there in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Of all the animals in Antarctica, penguins are the superstars. These Antarctic animals are both abundant and easy to observe. The Antarctic penguin population is estimated to number 75 million. The four “true” Antarctic penguin species (those living in continental Antarctica) are the Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap, and Emperor Penguins.</p>

<h2 id=how-big-are-fur-seals-in-the-antarctic>How big are fur seals in the Antarctic?</h2>
<p>Fur seals grow to be about seven feet long and 250 pounds, and they live on the coastal beaches of the Southern polar islands. Other sea creatures include animals as big as whales and as small as krill. Antarctic krill, though only six cm in size, are crucial in the Antarctic food chain.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-rules-for-animals-in-antarctica>What are the rules for animals in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Keep reading here and discover our full list of Antarctic animals, facts and more! Antarctic animal adaption to temperature stress are governed, primarily, by two rules. The first rule, Allen’s rule, states that endoderm animals are more ‘‘rounded and compact’’.</p>

<p>Antarctic animals – The most abundant and best known animals from the southern continent. Penguins, whales seals, albatrosses, other seabirds and a range of invertebrates you may have not heard of such as krill which form the basis of the Antarctic food web. These are the charismatic mega fauna…</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-life-do-you-see-in-antarctica>What kind of life do you see in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Really what everyone comes to see is the sea life as Antarctica’s waters literally brim with blue whales, orcas, squids, fur seals and penguins. Of course the penguins make it onshore regularly and you will see these dotted on various islands, icebergs and the Antarctic Peninsula.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-diving-birds-in-the-antarctic>Are there any diving birds in the Antarctic?</h2>
<p>This flightless diving bird lives exclusively in the southern hemisphere, but only five of all eighteen known species are residents of the Antarctic who are endemic as breeders on the continent, the adjacent ice or neighbouring islands.</p>

<p>Its populations are distributed on Antarctic continent, and islands like South Georgia, Scott, South Sandwich, South Orkney, South Shetland, Macquarie, Auckland, Heard, Crozet, and Kerguelen, according to the Department of Environment, Australia Antarctic Division.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-animals-adapted-to-live-in-antarctica>How are animals adapted to live in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>These animals are well adapted to survive this extreme weather and reproduce vibrantly therein. A lack of human development on the frozen continent also facilitates the prosperity of Antarctic wildlife.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-hidden-mysteries-of-antarctica>What are some of the hidden mysteries of Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Big structures, monsters, rows of tanks, hidden ufo’s, crash and take-off marks etc. Antarctica is a big mainly frozen place, the wind blows a lot, it snows, it thaws too sometimes, water expands when it freezes, ice that is over water can crack making unusual patterns.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-penguins-do-you-see-in-antarctica>What kind of penguins do you see in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Out of the 17 species of penguins in the world only 4 of these live and nest on the Antarctic Continent. These true Antarctica species are the Adélie, Chinstrap, Gentoo, Emperor Penguin. If you visit the Antarctic Peninsula you are likely to see all of these penguins except for the Emperor.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-life-is-there-in-antarctica>What kind of Life Is there in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Antarctica’s rich and contradictory feral life makes it one of the most perfect and wild places to visit on earth, with penguins, ocean birds, seals and whales living one next to the other.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-live-in-south-polar>What kind of animals live in south polar?</h2>

<h2 id=are-there-polar-bears-and-penguins-in-antarctica>Are there polar bears and Penguins in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>A common misconception, largely due to fiction and movies, is that polar bears and penguins live together. This, however, could not be further from the truth. Polar bears live in the Arctic (only), while penguins live Antarctica. But, why are there no polar bears in Antarctic?</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-eat-krill-in-antarctica>What kind of animals eat krill in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Krill is eaten by many other Antarctic animals, including whales, seals and seabirds. The total biomass (weight) of all of the Antarctic Krill in the world is thought to be larger than that of any other species. The wingless Antarctic Midge grows up to 6 mm (.25 in) in length.</p>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-organisms-live-in-the-soil-in-antarctica>What kind of organisms live in the soil in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Mites and microscopic organisms like nematodes and bacteria live in the soil. Animals and plants that live in Antarctica have special adaptations that allow them to survive in the extreme conditions. Nigel and Adélie penguins Nigel visits an Adélie penguin colony at Cape Bird.</p>
