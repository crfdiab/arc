</ul>
<h2 id=why-is-cancun-a-popular-tourist-destination>Why is Cancun a popular tourist destination?</h2>
<p>White Sand Beaches Of course, one of the main reasons this destination is so popular is because of its dazzling turquoise blue sea and white sand, which has led Cancun to be the most recognized Mexican tourist destination in the world (and number six among Mexican tourists).</p>
<h2 id=how-expensive-is-it-to-eat-in-cancún>How expensive is it to eat in Cancún?</h2>
<p>Food in Cancun is very cheap, and you can find cheap food in almost every corner, literally! From tacos to full three course meals you will pay anywhere from 10 to 45 pesos (~$1-4 USD). That’s about the average cost of food in Cancun, at least at the cheap places.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-things-to-do-in-cancun-mexico>What are the things to do in Cancun Mexico?</h2>
<p>Things to do in Cancun, Mexico span across land and sea. If you’re a landlubber, head to one of the resort’s golf courses or take a stroll through the interactive aquarium. If you want to get your feet wet, Cancun water adventures range from sailing and snorkeling to more adventurous sports like parasailing and scuba diving.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-popular-place-to-visit-in-mexico>Which is the most popular place to visit in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Known as the gateway to the Yucatan Peninsula, Cancun is often the first travel experience that most Americans have in Mexico. In fact up to 40% of American travelers are picking Mexico for their vacation. I’ll be the first to tell you that Cancun is not my favorite place in Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-beach-to-visit-in-cancun>Which is the best beach to visit in Cancun?</h2>
<p>If you’re tired of the standard beaches along the Hotel Zone, try heading to Playa Delfines, which is a largely undeveloped ribbon of sand located near El Rey. Likewise, the beach often lacks the heavy crowds found elsewhere throughout the Hotel Zone. Make sure to bring your own drinks and snacks since there won’t be opportunities to buy them here.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-for-americans-to-travel-to-cancun>Is it safe for Americans to travel to Cancun?</h2>
<p>Yes, Mexico is allowing travelers to visit, including American tourists. While you can’t drive over the US/Mexico border, you can still fly to cities like Cancun. Hotels, attractions, and private tours are open with new health & safety protocols in place, and many are operating at only 50-60% capacity.</p>
