<h2 id=what-important-tourist-attraction-lies-between-lake-ontario-and-lake-erie>What important tourist attraction lies between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie?</h2>
<p>The Niagara River is a connecting channel between two Great Lakes, Erie and Ontario. Niagara Falls has moved back seven miles in 12,500 years and may be the fastest moving waterfalls in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-between-lake-ontario-and-erie>What is between Lake Ontario and Erie?</h2>
<p>Welland Canal<br>
The Welland Canal is a ship canal in Ontario, Canada, connecting Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. It forms a key section of the St. Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes Waterway.</p>
<h2 id=which-iconic-landmark-separates-lake-erie-and-lake-ontario>Which iconic landmark separates Lake Erie and Lake Ontario?</h2>
<p>The Great Lakes Waterway connects the lake sidestream to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence Seaway and upstream to the other rivers in the chain via the Welland Canal and to Lake Erie.</p>
<h2 id=what-flows-north-from-lake-erie-to-lake-ontario>What flows north from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario?</h2>
<p>the Niagara<br>
Flowing in a northerly direction from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, a distance of about 35 miles (56 km), the Niagara constitutes part of the boundary between the United States and Canada, separating New York state from the province of Ontario.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-lake-ontario-special>Why is Lake Ontario special?</h2>
<p>Lake Ontario is the smallest of all the Great Lakes, with a surface area of 7,340 square miles (18,960 square kilometers), but its waters run deep. It holds about four times the water volume, at 393 cubic miles (1,640 cubic km), as Lake Erie, although it is similar in width and length.</p>
<h2 id=is-lake-ontario-lower-than-lake-erie>Is Lake Ontario lower than Lake Erie?</h2>
<p>As the surfaces of Lakes Superior, Huron, Michigan, and Erie are all approximately the same elevation above sea level, while Lake Ontario is significantly lower, and because the Niagara Escarpment precludes all natural navigation, the four upper lakes are commonly called the “upper great lakes”.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-best-place-to-drive-along-lake-erie>Where is the best place to drive along Lake Erie?</h2>
<p>Long Point Provincial Park is one of the coolest spots in southwest Ontario. It’s one of my key recommended spots for a drive along Lake Erie because there are many things to see here. The fourth oldest provincial park in Ontario (established 1921), it has 1.5 km of sandy beach. It’s located within a World Biosphere Reserve.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-ships-get-from-lake-ontario-to-lake-erie>How do ships get from Lake Ontario to Lake Erie?</h2>
<p>During the course of a morning or afternoon it’s not unusual to see two or more ships lifted or lowered through Lock 3. If you’ve ever seen a ship on Lake Ontario and wondered how it makes its way to Lake Erie, next time you’re headed to the wineries in St. Catharines or Niagara-on-the-Lake, you should stop at the Welland Canals Centre.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-see-on-the-north-shore-of-lake-erie>What to see on the north shore of Lake Erie?</h2>
<p>The north shore of Lake Erie takes you through some of Ontario’s most beautiful countryside. With many port towns along the way, farmer’s fields of corn, tobacco, and other produce, it’s an idyllic place, reminiscent of older times when weekend tourism was much less stressful.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-fort-erie-located-in-lake-erie>Where is Fort Erie located in Lake Erie?</h2>
<p>Fort Erie lies between Lake Erie and the Niagara River, offering 50 kilometers of water access. So if water fun is what you crave, look no further than the sandy shores of Fort Erie. Surrounded by miles and miles of sandy beaches and the clean, cool waters of Lake Erie and the Niagara River, Fort Erie is a water sports hotspot.</p>
