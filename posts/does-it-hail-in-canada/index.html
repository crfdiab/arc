<h2 id=does-it-hail-in-canada>Does it hail in Canada?</h2>
<p>Hail is a significant hazard in parts of Canada, causing damage to infrastructure and crops. Hail events have been recorded across Canada, but the storms resulting in the greatest damage to property and crops are most common in southern Alberta.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-so-much-hail-in-alberta-canada>Why is there so much hail in Alberta Canada?</h2>
<p>Being on the edge of the Rocky Mountains is part of the problem. Mountains and elevation are the perfect combination to create hail. This mix creates air full of moisture at a lower level and very cold and dry currents above coming from the peaks. “In Alberta during the summer, most days have a chance of hail.</p>
<h2 id=who-gets-the-most-hail-in-the-world>Who gets the most hail in the world?</h2>
<p>Although Florida has the most thunderstorms, Nebraska, Colorado, and Wyoming usually have the most hailstorms. The area where these three states meet – “hail alley” – averages seven to nine hail days per year. Other parts of the world that have damaging hailstorms include China, Russia, India and northern Italy.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-hail-alley-located>Where is hail alley located?</h2>
<p>This region, known as hail alley, lies predominantly within the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming. While their domain of greatest frequency is in the plains states, hailstorms have been observed just about everywhere thunderstorms occur.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-worst-hail-storm-in-history>What was the worst hail storm in history?</h2>
<p>The deadliest hailstorms, and perhaps the largest hailstones in the world, occur on the Deccan Plateau of northern India and in the interior regions of Bangladesh. The heaviest authenticated hailstone ever measured was one of 2.25 pounds that fell in the Gopalanj district of Bangladesh on April 14, 1986.</p>
<h2 id=what-city-has-the-most-hail>What city has the most hail?</h2>
<p>Insurance companies have dubbed the area where Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska meet as “Hail Alley.” National Weather Service statistics indicate Cheyenne, Wyoming, with an average of nine days of hail per year, as the “hail capital” of the United States.</p>

<h2 id=does-canada-get-natural-disasters>Does Canada get natural disasters?</h2>
<p>Moody Mother Nature: natural disasters in Canada. Prairies and forests, mountains and plains, rivers and streams, bitter cold and blazing heat – with such a diverse landscape and climate, it’s no wonder our country is prone to natural disasters. They can strike at any time – and they do, every year!</p>
<h2 id=who-has-died-from-hail>Who has died from hail?</h2>
<p>In spite of the enormous crop and property damage that hailstorms cause, only three people are known to have been killed by falling hailstones in modern U.S. history: a farmer caught in his field near Lubbock, Texas on May 13, 1930; a baby struck by large hail in Fort Collins, Colorado, on July 31, 1979; and a boater …</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-most-hail-occur-in-canada>Where does the most hail occur in Canada?</h2>
<p>Hail occurs right across Canada, though more frequently in Alberta, the southern Prairies and in southern Ontario. For many Canadians, a hail storm is an intriguing rarity, but for farmers whose crops are crushed — or other Canadians whose homes and cars are damaged — a hailstorm can translate into a financial burden.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-hailstorm-alleys-in-canada-located>Where are the hailstorm alleys in Canada located?</h2>
<p>Hailstorm Alley is a colloquial term referring to an area of south and central Alberta, Canada where hail storms are frequently produced. These storms frequently produce hail that is damaging to property.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-damage-does-hail-do-to-crops-in-canada>How much damage does hail do to crops in Canada?</h2>
<p>Crops are also damaged or destroyed by hail: the total agricultural loss by hail in Canada is estimated at close to $200 million per year, with 85% of the losses attributable to only 12% of the storms. In Alberta, attempts to reduce hail damage through cloud seeding with silver iodide have been undertaken since 1956.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-hailstorms-occur-in-the-world>How often do hailstorms occur in the world?</h2>
<p>The area where these three states meet – “hail alley” – averages seven to nine hail days per year. Other parts of the world that have damaging hailstorms include China, Russia, India and northern Italy. When viewed from the air, it is evident that hail falls in paths known as hail swaths.</p>
