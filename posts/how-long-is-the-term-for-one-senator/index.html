<h2 id=how-long-is-the-term-for-one-senator>How long is the term for one senator?</h2>
<p>A senator’s term of office is six years and approximately one-third of the total membership of the Senate is elected every two years. Look up brief biographies of Senators from 1774 to the present in the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-a-congressman-term>How long is a congressman term?</h2>
<p>Members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms and are considered for reelection every even year. Senators however, serve six-year terms and elections to the Senate are staggered over even years so that only about 1/3 of the Senate is up for reelection during any election.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-be-in-congress>How old do you have to be to be in Congress?</h2>
<p>Article I, Section 2, Clause 2: No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.</p>
<h2 id=can-an-immigrant-be-a-senator>Can an immigrant be a senator?</h2>
<p>The president is constitutionally required to be natural born, but foreign–born senators need only nine years of U.S. citizenship to qualify for office. Constitutional qualifications to be a senator are specified in Article I, section 3.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-are-us-senators-elected-in-georgia>How often are US senators elected in Georgia?</h2>
<p>United States Senators are popularly elected, for a six-year term, beginning January 3. Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. Before 1914, they were chosen by the Georgia General Assembly, and before 1935, their terms began March 4.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-us-senate-seat-in-georgia-become-vacant>When did the US Senate seat in Georgia become vacant?</h2>
<p>This is a chronological listing of the United States senators from Georgia . Georgia has had Senators since the 1st Congress. Its Senate seats were declared vacant in March 1861 owing to its secession from the Union. They were again filled from February 1871. United States senators are popularly elected, for a six-year term, beginning January 3.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-a-us-senator-serve-in-office>How long does a US Senator serve in office?</h2>
<p>United States senators serve 6-year terms, although they may seek reelection after each term, and there is no formal or official limit to the number of years or terms a senator may serve.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-georgia-state-senate-a-progressive-body>Is the Georgia State Senate a progressive body?</h2>
<p>The Georgia Senate is one of the most progressive legislative bodies in the United States and has been widely studied and copied by other states. A number of reforms during the past decade or so have made the Senate more democratic and responsive to the citizens of Georgia.</p>
