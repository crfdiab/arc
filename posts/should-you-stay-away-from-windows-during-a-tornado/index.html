<h2 id=should-you-stay-away-from-windows-during-a-tornado>Should you stay away from windows during a tornado?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseAccording to the experts, opening the windows will only succeed in letting the winds into the house so that internal supports can be shaken apart which will weaken the house even more. The bottom line is – don’t open your windows. It’s a waste of time! Try to outrun a tornado.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-way-to-stay-safe-during-a-tornado>What is the best way to stay safe during a tornado?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseGo to the basement or an inside room without windows on the lowest floor (bathroom, closet, center hallway). If possible, avoid sheltering in a room with windows. For added protection get under something sturdy (a heavy table or workbench). Cover your body with a blanket, sleeping bag or mattress.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-stay-safe-during-a-tornado>What’s the best way to stay safe during a tornado?</h2>
<p>Avoid windows and seek additional protection by getting underneath large, solid pieces of furniture. Avoid automobiles and mobile homes, which provide almost no protection from tornadoes. Those caught outside should lie flat in a depression or on other low ground and wait for the storm to pass. Originally published May 23, 2019.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-live-in-a-mobile-home-during-a-tornado>Is it safe to live in a mobile home during a tornado?</h2>
<p>NO MOBILE HOME IS SAFE IN A TORNADO. Watch for tornado danger signs: dark, often greenish clouds, wall cloud, cloud of debris. Bring your companion animals indoors and maintain direct control of them. Seek shelter in a basement, storm shelter or sturdy building.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-if-there-is-a-tornado-watch>What to do if there is a tornado watch?</h2>
<p>Even if a tornado watch is issued for your area, stay inside and be aware of changing weather conditions. Visit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s website to track the country’s most dangerous storms. Sometimes it’s as simple as looking out your window.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-take-cover-in-your-basement-during-a-tornado>Can you take cover in your basement during a tornado?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. In April an Iowa couple took cover in an all-concrete “tornado room” they’d built in their basement only to have the wind rip away the eight-inch-thick slab that served as its ceiling. Their pickup truck was then flung into the basement, flattening their pool table but leaving the remains of the bunker (and them) unharmed.</p>
