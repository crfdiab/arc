<p>The Original Woodstock Poster (1969) Created by graphic designer Arnold Skolnick, the original Woodstock poster features the iconic dove and guitar that has been associated with the festival for the past five decades. Originally, the symbol was a catbird and a flute.</p>

<p>$2,500<br>
What you see: An original 1969 Woodstock concert poster that shows just the artwork–no small text–and is signed by Arnold Skolnik, the artist who designed it. It’s in Very Good Plus condition and is estimated at $2,500.</p>

<p>Arnold Skolnick<br>
Arnold Skolnick is an award-winning graphic designer and the publisher of numerous art books, posters and catalogues. But Skolnick’s most famous work is the poster he created for a music festival that happened 50 years ago this month: Woodstock.</p>

<p>The peace sign<br>
— The peace sign is a universally known symbol, and it is now being used to celebrate the 46th anniversary of the classic Woodstock Music Festival. Museum officials in Bethel Woods created the giant peace sign crop circle as a tribute to the famous festival.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-you-tell-a-real-woodstock-poster>How can you tell a real Woodstock poster?</h2>
<p>The original Woodstock poster measured 24-by-36.75-inches, though it may be slightly smaller if a previous owner trimmed the edges for showcasing it in a poster frame. Reproductions are usually much smaller, with 18-by-24-inches a popular size. Look for a signature or number on the back or bottom edge of the poster.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-it-rain-at-woodstock-69>When did it rain at Woodstock 69?</h2>
<p>We also had a major thunderstorm on August 18, that dumped 46.7mm of rain on the city. On Sunday, just shortly after Joe Cocker finished his performance, a large thunderstorm swept across White Lake and Bethel, dumping over 25mm (1 inch) of rain near the venue.</p>
<h2 id=are-woodstock-tickets-worth-anything>Are Woodstock tickets worth anything?</h2>
<p>Although the original festival was free, if you’re still holding on to a ticket from the event, it could be worth some extra cash. Original Woodstock 1969 tickets and paraphernalia are available on eBay for anywhere from $15 to a couple thousand dollars, depending on condition and rarity.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-you-tell-if-a-poster-is-real>How can you tell if a poster is real?</h2>
<p>Original lithographic posters will not look pixelated under a loupe or magnifying glass. The process of stone lithography applies a solid layer of color to the paper, whereas posters that are digitally reproduced all have the tell-tale pixels when seen under magnification.</p>
<h2 id=is-my-concert-poster-an-original>Is my concert poster an original?</h2>
<p>For the consigners who discover that their “original first printing” concert posters aren’t so original, they’ll often sell them as reprints in our auction. The other consigners ask for their posters back so they can sell them through other avenues.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-artist-on-the-woodstock-poster>Who was the artist on the Woodstock poster?</h2>
<p>Signed by artist Arnold Skolnick, this poster gave the festival its iconic bird-on-guitar logo and its “3 Days of Peace & Music” tagline. Even signed versions are more common than you may believe — but this 2- by 3-foot version is not only in great condition; it has a certificate of authenticity from Skolnick himself.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-original-location-of-the-woodstock-music-festival>Where was the original location of the Woodstock Music Festival?</h2>
<p>View of the original poster (David Byrd, artist) for the Woodstock Festival (or Woodstock Music and Art Fair, as the poster reads), ‘An Aquarian Exposition,’ 1969. The poster gives the event’s original location of Wallkill, New York, which was changed shortly before the scheduled date, August 15-17, to Bethel, New York.</p>

<p>Walk around for three days without seeing a skyscraper or a traffic light. Fly a kite, sun yourself. Cook your own food and breathe unspoiled air. Camp out: water and restrooms will be supplied. Tents and camping equipment will be available at the Camp Store. Poster measures 24×36 inches, unframed.</p>

<p>Today, the Hendrix Stratocaster lives with Allen’s other prized guitars at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle. Sewn out of dyed denim, this flag was flown from the Woodstock stage and found on a farm next to the Woodstock site. The Bethel Woods Center for the Arts on the Woodstock site sells $20 replicas, but this one’s seen some things.</p>
