<h2 id=how-was-the-nhs-improved-in-the-1960s>How was the NHS improved in the 1960s?</h2>
<p>The 1960s was a great decade for the service, with treatment greatly improved by innovations such as the polio vaccine, chemotherapy and renal dialysis being introduced. In fact, one of the biggest decisions in NHS history was taken in 1961, when the contraceptive pill was made available and free on the service.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-nhs-improve-healthcare>How did the NHS improve healthcare?</h2>
<p>The NHS in England and Wales came into existence on the 5th July 1948. It provided coverage for a range of approved medical and pharmaceutical interventions. This resulted in rapid growth in the use of medicines and improved public health with its associated improvements in economic growth and development.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-roles-of-the-nhs>What are the roles of the NHS?</h2>
<p>Everyone has a responsibility for their own health, but the NHS is also responsible for helping people to improve their health and wellbeing. The NHS’s role in preventing poor health and promoting healthy living is essential to reduce health inequalities and sustain the NHS for future generations.</p>
<h2 id=how-has-the-nhs-changed-over-the-years>How has the NHS changed over the years?</h2>
<p>The NHS has both evolved and devolved in the 70 years since its birth, with many improvements in the health of the nation. A lot has changed; we are living longer, infectious diseases have reduced and cancer survival rates have improved.</p>
<h2 id=what-factors-led-to-the-nhs>What factors led to the NHS?</h2>
<p>The NHS created in 1948 was brought about through hard work and dedication from those that truly believed in new ideas about services, health, medical ethics and society more generally. The NHS has faced crisis, economic downturns, periods of prosperity, growth and so much more in its seventy years of operation.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-doctors-oppose-the-nhs>Why did doctors oppose the NHS?</h2>
<p>The BMA , who feared that doctors employed by the NHS, would lose income. Many local authorities and voluntary bodies, which ran hospitals, also objected as they feared they would lose control over them. Many people such as Winston Churchill and many Conservative MPs thought that the cost of the NHS would be too great.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-highest-paying-nhs-job>What is the highest paying NHS job?</h2>
<p>The highest-paying job at NHS is a a N/A with a salary of £1,000,000 per year. What is the lowest salary at NHS? The lowest-paying job at NHS is a a Front Desk Receptionist with a salary of £21,347 per year.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-functional-areas-of-the-nhs>What are the functional areas of the NHS?</h2>
<p>Functional Areas of NHS and Tesco</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer Services.</li>
<li>Human Resources (doctors, nurses etc)</li>
<li>Strategic leadership.</li>
<li>Finance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-was-the-life-expectancy-before-the-nhs>What was the life expectancy before the NHS?</h2>
<p>People now live 13 years longer than they did 70 years ago. Better access to healthcare has played a key role. But it is also worth noting that in the 70 years before the creation of the NHS, life expectancy actually increased by double what it has since.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-before-the-nhs>What happened before the NHS?</h2>
<p>Before the National Health Service was created in 1948, patients were generally required to pay for their health care. Free treatment was sometimes available from charitable voluntary hospitals. Some local authorities operated hospitals for local ratepayers (under a system originating with the Poor Laws).</p>
<h2 id=how-long-has-the-nhs-been-in-existence>How long has the NHS been in existence?</h2>
<p>In the 68 years since the NHS’s inception, and certainly the 150 years since Florence Nightingale founded the first nursing school, much has changed within the nursing profession.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-role-of-nurses-change-in-the-uk>When did the role of nurses change in the UK?</h2>
<p>During this decade, the profession’s first significant pay dispute took place, leading to a 22% pay rise and greater respect for the role. However, it was from the 1980s onwards that nursing really began to transform, in response largely to wider changes across the NHS, the scientific community and British society as a whole.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-a-nurse-in-the-1950s>What was the role of a nurse in the 1950s?</h2>
<p>The tasks and duties that comprise a modern day nurse’s job would be unrecognisable to his / her counterparts working in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s or even 1980s. Today, a nurse can conduct detailed medical assessments, prescribe drugs and contribute to medical research data gathering.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-specialist-nurses-in-the-uk>Why do we need specialist nurses in the UK?</h2>
<p>In part, this need for specialist nurses has been fuelled by the sheer speed at which our understanding of medical science has grown over the last 30 years; we have the theory and we need the nurse to put it to practical use. Today almost all nurses are degree holders and they all hold professional qualifications.</p>
