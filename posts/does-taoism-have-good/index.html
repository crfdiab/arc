<h2 id=does-taoism-have-good>Does Taoism have good?</h2>
<p>It disapproves of killing, stealing, lying and promiscuity, and promotes altruistic, helpful and kindly behaviour. Taoists believe such good behaviour is an essential part not only of self-improvement but of improving the world as a whole. Cultivate the Tao within oneself; and one’s virtue will be perfected.</p>
<h2 id=does-taoism-have-good-and-evil>Does Taoism have good and evil?</h2>
<p>Taoism beliefs on Good and Evil are that good flows with the way of Tao and empowers us to grow while evil is something that acts as a resistance to the growth. Evil damages the flow from the Tao. The way to overcome evil is to follow Tao, to realize wu-wei in life.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-benefits-of-taoism>What are the benefits of Taoism?</h2>
<p>Better circulation, muscle flexibility, healthier inner organs and much stronger energy. Also with this stronger energy comes a more tranquil mind and you feel more peaceful and generally happy!!!</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-taoism>What are the disadvantages of Taoism?</h2>
<p>Taoism devoted its energies to reflection and introspection so the natural principles that governed the world could be clearly understood. However, the cons are that it undermines the power of most governments, since its beliefs are that nature is the ruling power.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-taoism>What do you need to know about Taoism?</h2>
<p>Taoists believe in spiritual immortality, where the spirit of the body joins the universe after death. The Tao Te Ching, or “The Way and Its Power,” is a collection of poetry and sayings from around the third and fourth centuries B.C.E. that guides Taoist thought and actions.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-taoist-religion-recognized-by-the-chinese-government>Is the Taoist religion recognized by the Chinese government?</h2>
<p>Today, Taoism is one of five religions recognized by the People’s Republic of China. The government regulates its activities through the Chinese Taoist Association. Taoism is freely practiced in Taiwan, where it claims millions of adherents.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-word-tao-mean-in-chinese>What does the word Tao mean in Chinese?</h2>
<p>Taoism is both a philosophy and religion which has its roots connected to Chinese civilization. The word Tao means ‘The Way’. Interestingly, ‘the way’ here does not mean “having a concrete path” or “a predefined path” in life.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-gods-or-goddesses-in-taoism>Are there any gods or goddesses in Taoism?</h2>
<p>However, Taoists do not believe in this energy as a god. Rather, there are gods as part of the Taoist beliefs, often introduced from the various cultures found in the region known now as China. These gods are part of the Tao, like all living things.</p>
