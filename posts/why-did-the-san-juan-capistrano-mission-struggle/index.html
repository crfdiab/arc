<h2 id=why-did-the-san-juan-capistrano-mission-struggle>Why did the San Juan Capistrano Mission struggle?</h2>
<p>Many factors were involved in the Missions decline including the earthquake in December of 1812 which caused the Great Stone Church to collapse, the decline in birth rate, the increasing mortality rate of the population due to disease, the inability of Spanish government to adequately protect and supply the Missions …</p>
<h2 id=what-problems-did-mission-san-juan-bautista-have>What problems did Mission San Juan Bautista have?</h2>
<p>The mission is situated adjacent to the San Andreas Fault, and has suffered damage from numerous earthquakes, such as those of 1800 and 1906. However, the mission was never entirely destroyed at once. It was restored initially in 1884, and then again in 1949 with funding from the Hearst Foundation.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-mission-san-juan-capistrano-destroyed>When was Mission San Juan Capistrano destroyed?</h2>
<p>December 1812<br>
In December 1812, an earthquake destroyed the church at San Juan Capistrano Mission.</p>
<h2 id=were-there-any-natural-disasters-at-mission-san-juan-capistrano>Were there any natural disasters at Mission San Juan Capistrano?</h2>
<p>In the early morning of December 8, 1812 an earthquake shook the coast of Alta California, felling the bell tower of the newly built Great Stone Church at the Mission of San Juan Capistrano. The tower toppled onto the roof of the church full of Indian parishioners attending morning mass, killing forty.</p>
<h2 id=what-tribe-lived-in-san-juan-capistrano>What tribe lived in San Juan Capistrano?</h2>
<p>The Juaneño lived in what is now part of Orange and San Diego Counties and received their Spanish name from the priests of the California mission chain due to their proximity to Mission San Juan Capistrano. Today they call themselves the Juaneño Band of Mission Indians.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-mission-san-juan-bautista-used-for-today>What is Mission San Juan Bautista used for today?</h2>
<p>The San Juan Bautista Mission was first established in 1797 as Alta California’s 15th Catholic Mission. The largest of the 21 original Spanish mission churches in California, the building is still in use as a Catholic Church that has been in continuous operation since its opening in 1812.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-nickname-for-san-juan-capistrano>What is the nickname for San Juan Capistrano?</h2>
<p>Jewel of the California Missions<br>
Mission San Juan Capistrano is known as the “Jewel of the California Missions” and welcomes over 300,000 visitors each year.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-problem-with-mission-san-juan-capistrano>What was the problem with Mission San Juan Capistrano?</h2>
<p>One problem that Mission San Juan Capistrano had in 1812 was the earthquake. Another was in 1818, when a mean old pirate named Bouchard attacked the mission. When the Spanish tried to defend the mission they just did more damage.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-san-juan-capistrano-in-1900>What was life like in San Juan Capistrano in 1900?</h2>
<p>The years after 1900 were a period of stability for San Juan. The early years saw the community become a tight knit group of farm families and merchants, relatively untouched by the explosion of development to the north and south.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-founder-of-san-juan-capistrano>Who was the founder of San Juan Capistrano?</h2>
<p>It is a place of historical, cultural, and religious significance, as well as a place of inspiration and education. The story begins in 1775, when Mission San Juan Capistrano was first founded by Father Lasuen, on October 30th.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-mexican-independence-do-to-san-juan-capistrano>What did Mexican independence do to San Juan Capistrano?</h2>
<p>The Mexican independence of 1821 brought a new era to San Juan Capistrano. A Secularization Act was passed in 1833 to divest Mission lands. Instead of going to Indians as envisioned, land grants more often went to political appointees. These land grants began the Rancho system of large ranches owned by a few powerful men and families.</p>
