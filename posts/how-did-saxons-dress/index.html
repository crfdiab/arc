<h2 id=how-did-saxons-dress>How did Saxons dress?</h2>
<p>Men wore wool or linen hip-length undershirts with long sleeves, and probably loin-cloths. Woollen trousers were held up with a belt threaded through loops. A tunic was pulled over the head, and reached down to the knees. It was usually decorated at the wrists, neck and hem, and was long-sleeved.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-anglo-saxons-make-cloth>How did the Anglo Saxons make cloth?</h2>
<p>During the Anglo-Saxon era, textiles were created from natural materials: wool from sheep, linen from flax, and imported silk. In the fifth and sixth centuries, women were the manufacturers of clothing, weaving textiles on looms in their individual dwellings.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-anglo-saxon-royalty-wear>What did Anglo-Saxon royalty wear?</h2>
<p>Anglo-Saxon Royal Clothing For instance, by the 8th century, Anglo-Saxon kings were wearing leather tunic with elaborate decorations such as rings sewn on it to reflect their social status. Kings typically also wore a significantly long cloaks which came to use expensive silk trimmings by the 9th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-religion-are-anglo-saxons>What religion are Anglo-Saxons?</h2>
<p>The Germanic migrants who settled in Britain in the fifth century were pagans. From the end of the sixth century, missionaries from Rome and Ireland converted the rulers of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to a religion – Christianity – which had originated in the Middle East.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-saxon-slaves-called>What were Saxon slaves called?</h2>
<p>Like the Romans, the British and the Anglo-Saxons had lots of slaves. A slave was a person who was the property of another person. They were thought of as objects rather than people and could be bought and sold. A slave was called a ‘caeth’ in Brythonic and a ‘theow’ or ‘thrall’ in Old English.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-anglo-saxon-women-wear-in-their-clothes>What did the Anglo-Saxon women wear in their clothes?</h2>
<p>According to clothing historian, Penelope Walton-Rogers, “For the Anglo-Saxon woman, brooches, pins, clasps and buckles were as essential to her clothing as modern button and zip-fasteners.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-reconstruct-anglo-saxon-dress>Is it possible to reconstruct Anglo-Saxon dress?</h2>
<p>It is possible to reconstruct Anglo-Saxon dress using archaeological evidence combined with Anglo-Saxon and European art, writing and literature of the time period. Archaeological finds have both supported and contradicted the characteristic Anglo-Saxon costume as illustrated and described by these contemporary sources.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-teach-kids-about-the-anglo-saxon-period>What to teach kids about the Anglo Saxon period?</h2>
<p>The KS2 History curriculum explores the world of Anglo-Saxons as a part of British history, starting with the Stone Age and ending with the Viking and Anglo-Saxon struggle for power. The perfect way to get children engaged with the Anglo-Saxon period is to learn all about the culture, language and lifestyle of these Anglo-Saxon people.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-anglo-saxons-say-about-the-vikings>What did the Anglo-Saxons say about the Vikings?</h2>
<p>But as the trend grew, some Anglo-Saxon priests started to express concern over this blending of cultures… In the aftermath of the Viking raid on Lindisfarne in 793, the Anglo-Saxon monk and scholar Alcuin wrote an admonishing letter to King Æthelred of Northumbria (d. 796).</p>
