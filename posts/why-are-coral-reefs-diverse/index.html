<h2 id=why-are-coral-reefs-diverse>Why are coral reefs diverse?</h2>
<p>Coral reefs are one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on earth, rivaled only by tropical rain forests. Competition for resources such as food, space and sunlight are some of the primary factors in determining the abundances and diversity of organisms on a reef.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biodiversity-in-the-coral-reef>What is the biodiversity in the coral reef?</h2>
<p>They are home to more than 4,000 species of fish, 700 species of coral, and thousands of other species of plants and animals. Scientists estimate that, in total, more than one million species of plants and animals are associated with the coral reef ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=do-coral-reefs-have-high-genetic-diversity>Do coral reefs have high genetic diversity?</h2>
<p>Despite general degradation of coral reefs and recent reductions in coral population sizes due to natural and anthropogenic perturbations (e.g., bleaching events, disease outbreaks, storm damage, overfishing, increased coastal development and ship groundings), coral populations are genetically diverse with a …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-life-like-in-a-coral-reef>What is life like in a coral reef?</h2>
<p>Hidden beneath the ocean waters, coral reefs teem with life. Fish, corals, lobsters, clams, seahorses, sponges, and sea turtles are only a few of the thousands of creatures that rely on reefs for their survival. Coral reefs are also living museums and reflect thousands of years of history.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-genetic-diversity-is-there-in-each-coral-population>How much genetic diversity is there in each coral population?</h2>
<p>Allelic diversity per population ranged from 2 to 29 alleles per species-specific locus with a mean of 8.27 (±0.75 SE) alleles per locus.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-diversity-of-species-on-the-coral-reef>What are the diversity of species on the coral reef?</h2>
<p>A variety of sea anemones also occur here, with diversity probably higher than that found on the shallow reef a few hundred feet above. The diversity of sea stars (Asteroidea) is surprising, with quite a number of species which are rare in collections or completely unknown before our work.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-coral-reefs-important-to-the-world>Why are coral reefs important to the world?</h2>
<p>Coral Reef Biodiversity. Coral reefs, thanks to their diversity, provide millions of people with food, medicine, protection from storms, and revenue from fishing and tourism. An estimated six million fishermen in 99 reef countries and territories worldwide—over a quarter of the world’s small-scale fishermen—harvest from coral reefs.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-involved-in-coral-reefs>How many people are involved in coral reefs?</h2>
<p>An estimated six million fishermen in 99 reef countries and territories worldwide—over a quarter of the world’s small-scale fishermen—harvest from coral reefs. The biodiversity of reefs can also be appreciated simply for the wonder and amazement it inspires.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-coral-reefs-adapted-to-live-in-shallow-water>How are coral reefs adapted to live in shallow water?</h2>
<p>Shallow water, reef-building corals have a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae, which live in their tissues. The coral provides a protected environment and the compounds zooxanthellae need for photosynthesis. In return, the algae produce carbohydrates that the coral uses for food, as well as oxygen.</p>
