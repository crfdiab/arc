<p>On almost a daily basis at Lady Lash new clients ask us whether they can have eyelash extensions that look genuine and natural, and not fake or like stick-ons. The answer is, of course!

<h2 id=why-did-men-use-lashes-in-ancient-egypt>Why did men use lashes in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Everything you need to know about the history of eyelashes. In Ancient Egypt, men used to style their lashes in the same way as women. They used kohl and ointments (which was thought to be an aphrodisiac) to darken the lashes which used to protect their eyes from the sun’s harmful rays.</p>
