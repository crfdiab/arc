<h2 id=where-do-earthquakes-mostly-strike>Where do earthquakes mostly strike?</h2>
<p>Nearly 95% of all earthquakes take place along one of the three types of tectonic plate boundaries, but earthquakes do occur along all three types of plate boundaries. About 80% of all earthquakes strike around the Pacific Ocean basin because it is lined with convergent and transform boundaries.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-earthquake-and-where-do-they-happen>What causes earthquake and where do they happen?</h2>
<p>An earthquake is caused by a sudden slip on a fault. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth’s crust and cause the shaking that we feel. In California there are two plates – the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-aftershocks-after-an-earthquake>Why are there so many aftershocks after an earthquake?</h2>
<p>An earthquake releasing stress along one fault segment may place more stress on an adjacent region, thereby increasing the earthquake likelihood in that area. This may occur soon after the original event, which explains the phenomenon of aftershocks. Nepal has already seen aftershocks of a magnitude greater than six, and is likely to see more.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-transform-fault-cause-an-earthquake>How does a transform fault cause an earthquake?</h2>
<p>A transform fault is a strike-slip fault that is a boundary between two plates of earth’s crust.Causes of an Earthquake- Earthquakes happen because of faulting, which is a sudden rock movement that happens along a rupture or break surface. Earth’s surface is constantly moving slowly.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-so-hard-to-predict-earthquakes>Why is it so hard to predict earthquakes?</h2>
<p>If authorities had more warning that the earthquake was coming, they may have been able to save more lives. While Nepal is a documented area of previous seismic activity, at the moment there is no technique that provides predictions of sufficient clarity to allow for evacuations at short notice.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-earthquakes-most-likely-to-take-place>Where are earthquakes most likely to take place?</h2>
<p>The edges of oceanic and continental plates are where earthquakes happen the most. Plates are what the Earth’s crust is made of, and the Earth’s crust is the outer layer of planet Earth. Plates under the ocean are oceanic plates and all the other plates are continental plates.</p>
