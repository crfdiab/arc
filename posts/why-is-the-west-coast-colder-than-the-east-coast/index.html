<p>As these currents flow along the edges of continents, they affect the temperature of the coastal regions. Along the west coast of the U.S., the California Current carries cold water from the polar region southward, keeping the west coast relatively cooler than the east coast.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-california-beaches-significantly-colder-than-atlantic-coast-beaches>Why are California beaches significantly colder than Atlantic coast beaches?</h2>
<p>The California beaches are colder because the water on the west coast is colder than the water on the east coast. This is true because the ocean water rotates clockwise. The water off the west coast comes down from the cold north and the water on the east coast comes up from the warm south.</p>
<h2 id=what-climate-factors-affect-the-west-coast>What climate factors affect the west coast?</h2>
<p>Definition of the Marine West Coast This climate’s major characteristics are mild summers and winters and abundant annual precipitation. This ecosystem is highly influenced by its proximity to the coast and to mountains. It is sometimes known as the humid west coast climate or the oceanic climate.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-california-current-affect-the-west-coast>How does the California Current affect the West Coast?</h2>
<p>The California Current moves less water than the Gulf Stream does. But the California Current has a big effect on the climate of the West Coast of the United States. Usually, the climate along the West Coast is cooler than the climate of inland areas at the same latitude and elevation.</p>
<p>The Westerly Winds originate from the Pacific and make its way to the East Coast. Land has a lower heat capacity than oceans, and it also heats and cools faster than oceans. During the winter, land is much colder than the oceans.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-cooler-on-the-coast-during-warm-weather>Why is it cooler on the coast during warm weather?</h2>
<p>It’s courtesy of the sea breeze effect. National Weather Service meteorologist Walter Drag explains that it occurs due to the difference between the warm air over land and cool air hovering over the ocean (currently around 50 degrees).</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-california-current-move-from-north-to-south>Why does the California Current move from north to South?</h2>
<p>That’s because an ocean current moving from north to south along a west coast is pulled away from the shore by Earth’s rotation (the Coriolis effect ), leaving a void that allows deep water to fill in behind. In the image above, note how the green phytoplankton near the coast trace out the meanders and eddies from the California Current.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-ocean-so-cold-along-the-california-coast>Why is the ocean so cold along the California coast?</h2>
<p>Almost like a car rolling downhill, the easterly trade winds strengthen, causing upwelling off the coastlines of Peru and Ecuador and lowering sea surface temperatures throughout the eastern Pacific Ocean.</p>
