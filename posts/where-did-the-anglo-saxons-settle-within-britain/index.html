<h2 id=where-did-the-anglo-saxons-settle-within-britain>Where did the Anglo-Saxons settle within Britain?</h2>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons settled in many different parts of the country – the Jutes ended up in Kent, the Angles in East Anglia, and the Saxons in parts of Essex, Wessex, Sussex and Middlesex (according to whether they lived East, West, South or in the middle!) Not all Roman towns were abandoned, though.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-anglo-saxons-settle-in-britain>When did the Anglo-Saxons settle in Britain?</h2>
<p>It was during the second half of the fifth century that more and more Anglo-Saxons arrived to take land for themselves. It is for this reason that the time of the Anglo-Saxons is usually thought of as beginning about AD 450. Who were the Anglo-Saxons?</p>
<h2 id=where-did-anglo-saxons-settle-ks2>Where did Anglo-Saxons settle KS2?</h2>
<p>England<br>
KS2: Who were the Anglo-Saxons? The Anglo-Saxons were a mix of tribes from Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. The three biggest were the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes. The land they settled in was ‘Angle-land’, or England.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-saxons-move-to-britain>Why did the Saxons move to Britain?</h2>
<p>Some sources say that the Saxon warriors were invited to come, to the area now know as England, to help keep out invaders from Scotland and Ireland. Another reason for coming may have been because their land often flooded and it was difficult to grow crops, so they were looking for new places to settle down and farm.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-anglo-saxons-settle-in-england>When did the Anglo-Saxons settle in England?</h2>
<p>Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. This process occurred from the mid-fifth to early seventh centuries, following the end of Roman power in Britain around the year 410. The settlement was followed by the establishment of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the south and east of Britain, later followed by the rest of modern England.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-anglo-saxons-settle-in-tonbridge>Why did the Anglo-Saxons settle in Tonbridge?</h2>
<p>Tonbridge was an ideal place to settle as it was on the main track from Hastings to London and has a river. At the time when the Anglo-Saxons came to England much of the country was covered in forest. Only about a few thousand people in the whole land (today there are about 50 million people living in England).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-anglo-saxon-villages-get-their-names>How did the Anglo Saxon villages get their names?</h2>
<p>There were tiny windows and a hole in the roof to allow smoke to escape. Many towns and villages still carry their Anglo-Saxon names today, including “England” which comes from the Saxon word “Angle-Land”. Early Anglo-Saxon villages were named after the leader of the tribe so everyone knew who was in charge.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-anglo-saxons-take-over-the-castle>When did the Anglo-Saxons take over the castle?</h2>
<p>After the Romans left, the Britons used it as a place to live and a place to be safe. But in AD491 the Anglo-Saxons attacked and took over the castle. We know this because archaeologists have found Anglo-Saxon pots inside. This happened a lot to Roman towns and buildings.</p>
