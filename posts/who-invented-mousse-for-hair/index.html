<h2 id=who-invented-mousse-for-hair>Who invented mousse for hair?</h2>
<p>Hair mousse originated in France and was brought to the North American retail market by L’Oreal in the 1980s, the first mousse product coming out under the label “Valence”. It is often dispensed in an aerosol foam spray or in cream form.</p>
<h2 id=who-made-the-first-hair-spray>Who made the first hair spray?</h2>
<p>Hairspray was first used and developed in 1943 during the 2nd world war by Chase Products Company by Lebanese immigrant Tanios Chakchay in Boardview, Illinois.</p>
<h2 id=why-mousse-is-bad-for-hair>Why mousse is bad for hair?</h2>
<p>They can, because of varying amounts of alcohol in the formulas (an integral part of the mousse`s formula that aids quick drying), cause drying of the hair ends. Depending upon how much mousse is used or abused, it can damage fine, colored or permed hair with overuse.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-hairspray-hair-invented>When was hairspray hair invented?</h2>
<p>1948<br>
Hairspray became common after the patent of the aerosol process and the making of the aerosol spray can during the 1940s. It was first packaged in 1948, as the beauty industry saw that the aerosol cans used in WWII for insecticides could be used as a dispenser for hairspray.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-mousse-make-my-hair-crunchy>Why does mousse make my hair crunchy?</h2>
<p>What causes that crunch? Maya says “It’s common for mousse to be combined with gel or cream because most mousses on the market contain alcohol to make the hair dry faster. They are also polymer rich, which creates a sticky coating on the hair, much like a hairspray. This can leave hair feeling dry and stiff.</p>
<h2 id=is-mousse-for-straight-hair>Is mousse for straight hair?</h2>
<p>If you have straight hair…it’s not so much about adding volume as it is about adding body and movement. Those with straight hair know this all too well, and that’s where hair mousse comes in. Use a dollop of mousse to add some texture and help provide structure to your hairstyle.</p>
<h2 id=did-they-have-hairspray-in-the-1920s>Did they have hairspray in the 1920s?</h2>
<p>Early hair sprays were developed in Europe in the 1920s. In the US, hair sprays were developed around the time of the aerosol can in the 1940s, and the first patents describing copolymers for hair styling were published in the 1940s.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-ok-to-use-mousse-everyday>Is it OK to use mousse everyday?</h2>
<p>You can use hair mousse daily or weekly; there are no limitations from a safety or health standpoint. If you notice that your hair is beginning to dry out, you may want to lessen the number of times you use it. Hair volumizing mousse can make your hair feel sticky or hard if you add too much at a time.</p>
<h2 id=is-mousse-better-than-gel>Is mousse better than gel?</h2>
<p>Yes, it is true that mousse is better for sculpting and volume while gel is better for hold and frizz. But when it comes down to using mousse or gel for curly hair, neither is good option if you glob it on your hair.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-use-before-hairspray-was-invented>What did people use before hairspray was invented?</h2>
<p>bandoline<br>
Long before the twentieth century invention of aerosol hairspray, Victorian women were using sticky hair products to fix their wayward locks stiffly into place. Of these, the most popular was a clear gum solution known as bandoline. Liquid bandoline could be purchased at most Victorian perfumers.</p>
<h2 id=is-mousse-supposed-to-make-hair-crunchy>Is mousse supposed to make hair crunchy?</h2>
<p>Mousse is lighter than most hair gels and pomades, which gives it several advantages – namely, it won’t weigh hair down or form “crunchy” deposits. Mousse is great for both men and women, especially those with fine or thin hair in need of a volumizing boost.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-company-to-make-hair-spray>Who was the first company to make hair spray?</h2>
<p>In the US, the first to package it was Chase products (an aerosol manufacturer) in 1948, as the beauty industry saw that the aerosol cans used in World War II for insecticides could be used as a dispenser for hairspray. It thrived and became increasingly popular and mass-produced, as updos and other such hairstyles were created.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-people-stop-using-hairspray-on-their-hair>When did people stop using hairspray on their hair?</h2>
<p>Late 1960s and 1970s. The abundant use of hairspray ended in the mid- to late ’60s with changes in women’s hairstyles and political outlook. The long straight hair and natural look worn by the flower children, hippies and women libbers did not lend itself to being teased and sprayed.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-hairspray-stick-to-your-hair>What makes a Hairspray stick to your hair?</h2>
<p>According to Joseph Dallal and Colleen Rocafort, who wrote the 1997 book “Hair Styling/Fixative Products in Hair and Hair Care,” hairsprays are fine mists of a chemical compound that are propelled from an aerosol can or pump container. The chemicals, or polymer, make the shafts of hair stick together.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-women-spray-their-hair-in-the-60s>Why did women spray their hair in the 60s?</h2>
<p>The long straight hair and natural look worn by the flower children, hippies and women libbers did not lend itself to being teased and sprayed. Later, women began spraying their hair with a light- to medium-hold spray that kept their hair in place but did not look and feel stiff and unnatural.</p>
