<h2 id=did-thomas-more-agree-with-henry-viii>Did Thomas More agree with Henry VIII?</h2>
<p>More served as an important counselor to King Henry VIII of England, serving as his key counselor in the early 1500s, but after he refused to accept the king as head of the Church of England, he was tried for treason and beheaded (he died in London, England, in 1535).</p>
<h2 id=what-influenced-thomas-more>What influenced Thomas More?</h2>
<p>More’s Influences – Fellow European Humanists Desiderius Erasmus hugely influenced Thomas More. The two friends hugely admired the Greek satirist Lucian. More had introduced Erasmus to the writer and the influence of this can be seen in The Praise of Folly. Behind all their work was the humanist desire for progress.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-thomas-more-oppose-henry-viii>Why did Thomas More oppose Henry VIII?</h2>
<p>More also opposed Henry VIII’s separation from the Catholic Church, refusing to acknowledge Henry as supreme head of the Church of England and the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. After refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy, he was convicted of treason and executed.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-king-henry-viii-angry-at-thomas-more>Why was King Henry VIII angry at Thomas More?</h2>
<p>King Henry VIII wanted the man to be clear on his position regarding the new law, and he did not find his friend’s silence acceptable, deeming him a threat. As a result, the English government arrested Sir Thomas More in 1534 on charges of treason.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-thomas-more-influence-humanism>How did Thomas More influence humanism?</h2>
<p>He believed in the individual achievements of a man as long as they realized that it was all from God and for God. The movement was Sir Thomas’ attempt to reform and redeem his society. Thomas more participated in the spreading of Christian Humanism, introducing it to our world today.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-mortimer-want-to-kill-king-henry>Why did Mortimer want to kill King Henry?</h2>
<p>They planned to kill the king and replace him with Mortimer who actually had a claim to the throne which was superior to Henry’s. Henry’s father, Henry Bolingbroke, had been banished by his cousin, the weak Richard II.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-england-married-to>Who was the King of England married to?</h2>
<p>King Henry was married to Catherine of Aragon but had reportedly developed an infatuation with the alluring Anne Boleyn. (Spoiler: that wouldn’t work out as well. He would go on to behead her too just three years later.) Trouble started brewing when King Henry wanted to divorce Catherine of Aragon.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-second-wife-of-king-henry>Who was the second wife of King Henry?</h2>
<p>Anne Boleyn was King Henry’s second and possibly most infamous wife for whom the King changed England’s religion and separated from the Church of Rome to marry and sire a much longed-for male heir with.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-henry-bolingbroke-banished-by-richard-ii>Why was Henry Bolingbroke banished by Richard II?</h2>
<p>Henry’s father, Henry Bolingbroke, had been banished by his cousin, the weak Richard II. When Bolingbroke’s father, the youngest son of Edward III, died, Richard would not acknowledge the right of the young Henry to inherit the Duchy of Lancaster.</p>
