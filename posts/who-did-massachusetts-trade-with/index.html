<h2 id=who-did-massachusetts-trade-with>Who did Massachusetts trade with?</h2>
<p>The Massachusetts Bay Colony was economically successful, trading with England, Mexico and the West Indies. In addition to barter, transactions were done in English pounds, Spanish “pieces of eight”, and wampum in the 1640s.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-new-england-people-trade>What did the New England people trade?</h2>
<p>Trade was one of the first bridges between New England colonists and local Native American populations. The Native Americans provided skins, hides, food, knowledge, and other crucial materials and supplies, while the settlers traded beads and other types of currency (also known as “wampum”) in exchange for these goods.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-trade-did-the-massachusetts-bay-colony-have>What kind of trade did the Massachusetts Bay Colony have?</h2>
<p>Certain businesses, notably shipbuilding, fisheries, and the fur and lumber trades, quickly got started. As early as 1632 ships built in the colony began trading, either with other colonies, England, or foreign ports in Europe.</p>

They also built local stores and warehouses to sell and hold their products. Maritime commerce soon developed into the bustling “Triangular Trade.”.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-slavery-affect-the-massachusetts-bay-colony>How did slavery affect the Massachusetts Bay Colony?</h2>
<p>Slavery also played an important role in the Massachusetts Bay Colony’s economy. Starting in 1644, Boston merchants began to engage in the Triangle Trade, a three-stop trade route in which merchants imported slaves from Africa, sold them in the West Indies and then bought cane sugar to bring back to Massachusetts to make molasses and rum.</p>
