<h2 id=what-is-seasonal-wind-called>What is seasonal wind called?</h2>
<p>The monsoon winds are known as seasonal winds.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-seasonal-wind-that-occurs-in-south-and-southeast-asia>What is a seasonal wind that occurs in South and Southeast Asia?</h2>
<p>Monsoon, a major wind system that seasonally reverses its direction—such as one that blows for approximately six months from the northeast and six months from the southwest. The most prominent monsoons occur in South Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Pacific coast of Central America.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-monsoon-a-seasonal-wind>Is a monsoon a seasonal wind?</h2>
<p>One of the most commonly recognized seasonal winds are the monsoon winds. Although monsoons are often erroneously identified as rainstorms, they are actually a seasonal wind. A monsoon is a wind in low-latitude climates that seasonally changes direction between winter and summer.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-seasonal-winds>What are the two seasonal winds?</h2>
<p>The winds blowing throughout the year from one latitude to another in response to latitudinal differences in air pressure are called “planetary or prevailing winds”. They involve large areas of the globe. Two most important prevailing winds are trade winds and westerly winds.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-a-seasonal-wind>Why is it called a seasonal wind?</h2>
<p>The winds blow from the south-west direction in the summer season and from the north-east direction in the winter. As the characteristics of the winds change in different seasons, the winds are also called seasonal winds.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-seasonal-winds-affect-climate>How do seasonal winds affect climate?</h2>
<p>Prevailing winds bring air from one type of climate to another. For example, warm winds that travel over water tend to collect moisture as they travel; the water vapor in the air will condense as it moves into colder climates, which is why temperate coastal areas often receive heavy rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-characteristics-of-seasonal-winds>What are the main characteristics of seasonal winds?</h2>
<p>Seasonal winds are movements of air repetitively and predictably driven by changes in large-scale weather patterns.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-examples-of-local-winds>What are examples of local winds?</h2>
<p>10.19: Local Winds</p>
<ul>
<li>Land and Sea Breezes.</li>
<li>Monsoons.</li>
<li>Mountain and Valley Breezes.</li>
<li>Katabatic Winds.</li>
<li>Chinook Winds.</li>
<li>Santa Ana Winds.</li>
<li>Desert Winds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-are-winds-classified>How are winds classified?</h2>
<p>Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed and direction, the forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, gale, storm, and hurricane.</p>
<h2 id=which-type-of-wind-is-monsoon>Which type of wind is monsoon?</h2>
<p>A monsoon is a seasonal wind system that shifts its direction from summer to winter as the temperature differential changes between land and sea. Monsoons often bring torrential summerrains, such as on the Indian subcontinent where the summer monsoon delivers three-quarters of the country’s annual precipitation.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-winds-in-south-asia>What are the names of the winds in South Asia?</h2>
<p>| Certified Educator. The name usually used to refer to seasonal winds in South Asia (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) is “monsoon.”. These winds blow from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea and deliver heavy rainfall to the region. Monsoons, which are called “Nairutya Maarut” in India, are caused by sea breezes.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-definition-of-a-seasonal-wind>Which is the best definition of a seasonal wind?</h2>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-wind-is-a-monsoon-wind>What kind of wind is a monsoon wind?</h2>
<p>Although monsoons are often erroneously identified as rainstorms, they are actually a seasonal wind. A monsoon is a wind in low-latitude climates that seasonally changes direction between winter and summer.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-climate-does-southeast-asia-have>What kind of climate does Southeast Asia have?</h2>
<p>The climate in Southeast Asia is mainly tropical, hot and humid all year round with plentiful rainfall. Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shift in winds or monsoon. Mountain areas in the northern region have milder weather because of the altitude.</p>
