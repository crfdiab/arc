<h2 id=why-did-general-lee-invade-the-union>Why did General Lee invade the Union?</h2>
<p>In the spring of 1862, the Confederacy exerted its maximum mobilization effort to secure its independence. As he had done in 1862, Lee saw his victory as an opportunity to be followed up by invading the North in the hopes of annihilating a Federal army on Union soil.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-general-lee-invade>What did General Lee invade?</h2>
<p>The Gettysburg campaign was a military invasion of Pennsylvania by the main Confederate army under General Robert E. Lee in summer 1863. The Union won a decisive victory at Gettysburg, July 1–3, with heavy casualties on both sides. Lee managed to escape back to Virginia with most of his army.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-robert-elee-invade-maryland>Why did Robert E.Lee invade Maryland?</h2>
<p>Why Lee Invaded Maryland: Lee’s greatest objective was that a victory in the North could possibly gain diplomatic recognition from Europe and bring England and France to the aid and assistance of the South. Such a victory might cause the people of the North to question President Abraham Lincoln’s leadership and force him to sue for peace.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-robert-elee-retreat-from-maryland>When did Robert E.Lee retreat from Maryland?</h2>
<p>Lee’s bold maneuvering ended when he retreated from Maryland following the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, closing a three-month period that should be viewed as a single huge operation that reoriented the war from the outskirts of Richmond to the Potomac frontier and marked Lee’s spectacular debut as a field commander.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-robert-elee-take-command-of-the-virginia-peninsula>When did Robert E.Lee take command of the Virginia Peninsula?</h2>
<p>George B. McClellan’s Army of the Potomac had invaded the Virginia Peninsula during the Peninsula Campaign and by June stood only a few miles outside the Confederate capital at Richmond. But, when Robert E. Lee assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia on June 1, 1862, fortunes reversed.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-lee-move-north-after-the-battle-of-antietam>Why did Lee move north after the Battle of Antietam?</h2>
<p>Following his victory in the northern Virginia campaign, Lee moved north with 55,000 men through the Shenandoah Valley starting on September 4, 1862. His objective was to resupply his army outside of the war-torn Virginia theater and to damage Northern morale in anticipation of the November elections.</p>
