<p>Why is the British TV series ‘Skins’ called ‘Skins? ‘ – Quora. The first reason, as the others said before, is that here “skin” means the paper used to roll cigarettes, a clear reference to the lifestyle of the main characters.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-seasons-of-skins-are-on-netflix>How many seasons of Skins are on Netflix?</h2>

<h2 id=which-skin-generation-is-best>Which skin generation is best?</h2>
<p>Generation 2 was the best generation in my opinion. Generation 3 had potential but then when their second season came out, it ruined all their chances. All the possible plot lines that Gen. 3’s first season set up were all ignored during their second season I feel and because of that Generation 2 was the best.</p>
<h2 id=does-naomi-die-in-skins>Does Naomi die in Skins?</h2>
