<p>The record for the world’s fastest lift is held by the Lotte World Tower in Seoul, South Korea. The tower itself measures 555 m (1,820 ft) in height. The double-decker lift, called Sky Shuttle, is 496 m (1,627 ft) tall and was created by the Lotte World Tower and Otis Elevator Company.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-difference-between-elevator-and-lift>What is difference between elevator and lift?</h2>
<p>The difference between a lift and a home elevator is in both the design and cost. An elevator has a totally enclosed cab and requires a shaft. A lift typically has an open cab, except for 42” panels on the sides of the platform. Lifts are generally more basic and lower cost than elevators.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-building-to-have-elevators>What was the first building to have elevators?</h2>
<p>The eight-story, 130-foot Equitable Life Building in downtown Manhattan, completed in 1870, was the first office building to feature elevators from the design stage. Built by the Otis Elevator Company, they were based on hydraulics. “When we make the shift from hotels to commercial buildings, the steam engine disappears because it’s too slow.</p>

It travels at 67 feet per second (or 46 miles an hour) and runs continuously through 1,898 of the skyscrapers’ 2,073 feet. Taller buildings have made elevator engineering more complicated.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-taller-buildings-make-elevator-engineering-more-complicated>Why are taller buildings make elevator engineering more complicated?</h2>
<p>Taller buildings have made elevator engineering more complicated. The first problem is that a significant portion of the building’s footprint needs to be reserved for the shafts, but there are also limits to what can be accomplished.</p>
