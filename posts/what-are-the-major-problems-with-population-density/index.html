<h2 id=what-are-the-major-problems-with-population-density>What are the major problems with population density?</h2>
<p>Higher population density has definitely enabled economic and social development. But, at the same time the growth in the overall population of the planet is threatening to exacerbate many environmental and economic population, such as over-fishing, higher pollution, loss of habitat and stress on water.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-you-think-there-is-differences-in-the-population-density>Why do you think there is differences in the population density?</h2>
<p>In biology, a population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area. The population is the unit of natural selection and evolution. However, the size of a population may be less important than its density.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-population-density-actually-tell-us>What does population density actually tell us?</h2>
<p>In the U.S., population density is typically expressed as the number of people per square mile of land area. In a broad sense, this number tells us how many people would live within one square mile if the U.S. population were evenly distributed across its land area.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-population-density-of-a-square-mile>What is the population density of a square mile?</h2>
<p>Population density is the measure of the number of people per unit area, commonly represented as people per square mile (or square kilometer). The population density of the planet (including all land area) is about 38 people per square mile (57 per sq km).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-definition-of-a-misleading-statistic>What is the definition of a misleading statistic?</h2>
<p>What Is A Misleading Statistic? Misleading statistics are simply the misusage – purposeful or not – of a numerical data. The results provide a misleading information to the receiver, who then believes something wrong if he or she does not notice the error or the does not have the full data picture.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-population-densities-of-the-continents>What are the population densities of the continents?</h2>
<p>Here are the population densities of the continents: North America – 60.7 people per square mile. South America – 61.3 people per square mile. Europe – 187.7 people per square mile. Asia – 257.8 people per square mile. Africa – 103.7 people per square mile. Australia – 7.8 people per square mile.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-people-who-misuse-statistics>Who are the people who misuse statistics?</h2>
<p>It is often assumed that the misuse of statistics is limited to those individuals or companies seeking to gain profit from distorting the truth, be it economics, education or mass media. However, the telling of half-truths through study is not only limited to mathematical amateurs.</p>
