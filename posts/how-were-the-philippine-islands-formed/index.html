<h2 id=how-were-the-philippine-islands-formed>How were the Philippine Islands formed?</h2>
<p>The Philippines did not break out from Pangaea. Rather, the Philippine islands were formed by volcanic eruptions that occurred under the Pacific Ocean over millions of years. When these underwater volcanoes erupted, the magma eventually cooled and hardened.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-philippine-island-emerged>How did the Philippine island emerged?</h2>
<p>Due to geological and plate tectonic evolution, primarily due to the Pacific plate and Australian plate moving inward to the Asian plate; the island of Luzon and Mindanao started to show up and became an intersection of complex collisions between tectonic plates. This area is then called the Philippine Mobile Plate.</p>
<h2 id=how-indonesia-was-formed-as-an-archipelago>How Indonesia was formed as an archipelago?</h2>
<p>The Indonesian archipelago was formed during the thaw after the Last Glacial Maximum. Early humans travelled by sea and spread from mainland Asia eastward to New Guinea and Australia. Some of these practices remain in areas including the Batak areas of Sumatra, Toraja in Sulawesi, and several islands in Nusa Tenggara.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-islands-formed-upsc>How are islands formed Upsc?</h2>
<p>Collision of oceanic plates or ocean-ocean convergence (formation of volcanic island arcs). Collision of continental and oceanic plates or ocean-continent convergence (formation of continental arcs and fold mountains). Collision of continental plates or continent-continent convergence (formation of fold mountains)</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-first-humans-in-the-philippines>Who were the first humans in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>67,000 years ago) The earliest known hominin remains in the Philippines is the fossil discovered in 2007 in the Callao Caves in Cagayan. The 67,000-year-old find predates the 47,000-year-old Tabon Man, which was until then the earliest known set of human remains in the archipelago.</p>
<h2 id=where-would-the-philippines-be-in-pangaea-ultima>Where would the Philippines be in Pangaea Ultima?</h2>
<p>the Philippines will never be exist because Philippines is small country that made by oceanic oceanic convergence.. the Pangaea ultima is just a prediction of geologist to know what happens in the future.. the Philippines will not be seen because of compressed of other continents.</p>
<h2 id=how-volcanic-island-arc-is-formed>How volcanic island arc is formed?</h2>
<p>Offshore volcanoes form islands, resulting in a volcanic island arc. Generally, volcanic arcs result from the subduction of an oceanic tectonic plate under another tectonic plate, and often parallel an oceanic trench.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-philippine-islands-come-to-be>How did the Philippine Islands come to be?</h2>
<p>At that time, the Philippine tectonic plate sat squeezed between the vast Pacific and Asiatic plates. Geologically speaking, the Philippine archipelago was formed by volcanic eruptions from under the sea and the buckling of the earth’s crust when two tectonic plates collided about 65 million years ago.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-the-formation-of-islands-in-indonesia>What causes the formation of islands in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>The shifting tectonic plates and existence of subduction zone in the area where the Indonesian and Philippines Islands are located causes the formation of an island arc or archipelago.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-indonesia-and-the-philippines-the-same>How are Indonesia and the Philippines the same?</h2>
<p>Both Indonesian and Philippines archipelagos are a result of a combination of volcanic activity and tectonic plate movement. Both islands have been hotbeds of volcanic and seismic activity due to the convergence of continental plates.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-people-of-indonesia-come-from>Where did the people of Indonesia come from?</h2>
<p>The people of Indonesia are descendants of a common migration from the Philippines and Taiwan. Certain tribes, mostly from Sumatera and Borneo back-migrated to the Philippines, particularly to the central and southern parts.</p>
