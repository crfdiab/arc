<h2 id=why-did-the-pearl-industry-decline-in-the-uae>Why did the pearl industry decline in the UAE?</h2>
<p>In the late 1920s and early 1930s, several factors led to the decline of the pearl diving industry, such as the spread of Japanese cultural pearling. This decline led to the decline of all the classes in the UAE pearling industry and to the rise of new classes related to the oil industry.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-pearling-industry-began-to-decline-in-kuwait>Why did the pearling industry began to decline in Kuwait?</h2>
<p>Some Kuwaiti merchant families became rich due to gold smuggling to India. Kuwait’s pearling industry also collapsed as a result of the worldwide economic depression.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-pearling-in-uae>What is pearling in UAE?</h2>
<p>Pearl diving was practiced only part of the year, from April to September. During these months, the water was warm enough for divers from Abu Dhabi and Dubai to dive safely. Their boats, known as dhows, were wooden sailing vessels that featured a triangular sail.</p>

<p>2000<br>
The industry lingered, much-reduced, throughout the 20th century, its final demise being marked by the official closure of Kuwait’s pearl-oyster market in the year 2000, which brought to an end over 7000 years of pearling in the region.</p>

<p>It further declined by the late 1920s and early 1930s. By that time, the Japanese had found a way to make flawless artificial pearls. This was the main reason for the decline of the pearling industry. The onset of the Great Depression and the reduction in yields from the pearl banks also added to the loss of business for pearl divers in the UAE.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-pearling-industry-in-the-uae>Is there a pearling industry in the UAE?</h2>
<p>While this picturesque poignancy serves up a nice slice of living history – and much pride in it – there is more dynamism and depth to the UAE’s pearling industry.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-pearls-of-the-uae-come-from>Where did the pearls of the UAE come from?</h2>
<p>UAE pearls have been documented to have traveled all the way to Rome, Venice, India, Sri Lanka, and some have even pointed to evidence of pearls from the UAE showing up in Viking possessions in Scandinavia. The pearls of the UAE were one of the most sought-after accessories of the time. Pearl diving provided a relatively good income</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-pearling-ecosystem-important-to-the-uae>Why was the pearling ecosystem important to the UAE?</h2>
<p>The pearling ecosystem also reveals how the UAE’s internationalisation began much before the discovery of oil, and helped shaped the country’s huge ambitions. Despite the rustic nature of their trade, this enterprising community catered to a global audience that lay far beyond their shores.</p>
