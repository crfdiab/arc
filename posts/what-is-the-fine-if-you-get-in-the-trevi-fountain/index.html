<h2 id=what-is-the-fine-if-you-get-in-the-trevi-fountain>What is the fine if you get in the Trevi Fountain?</h2>
<p>Rome’s new ‘zero tolerance’ policy means anyone caught taking a dip in the fountains may be fined up to €450. It may be tempting to jump into one of Rome’s fountains during the scorching summer months, when the hot and sticky weather in the capital can become almost unbearable.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-special-about-the-trevi-fountain>What is special about the Trevi Fountain?</h2>
<p>The Trevi Fountain is one of the oldest water sources in Rome. The fountain dates back to ancient Roman times, since the construction of the Aqua Virgo Aqueduct in 19 B.C. that provided water to the Roman baths and the fountains of central Rome.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-they-clean-the-trevi-fountain>How often do they clean the Trevi Fountain?</h2>
<p>every two weeks<br>
Azienda Comunale Energia e Ambiente (ACEA), the company responsible for the maintenance of many of Rome’s historic fountains, drains and cleans the fountain every two weeks to monitor pH and chlorine levels in the recycled water.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-illegal-to-sit-on-the-spanish-steps>Why is it illegal to sit on the Spanish Steps?</h2>
<p>Sitting on Rome’s famous Spanish Steps is no longer allowed as the city has brought a ban into effect against such behaviour to protect its cultural relics. Police officers have begun patrolling the steps and cautioning anyone found sitting on them.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-trevi-fountain-free>Is the Trevi Fountain free?</h2>
<p>You’ll find this popular destination just west of the Trevi Fountain. This is one of the most impressive architectural feats in all of Rome and it is currently still free to visit.</p>
<h2 id=do-trevi-fountain-wishes-come-true>Do Trevi Fountain wishes come true?</h2>
<p>Tradition says that if you throw a coin in the fountain and make a wish, it will come true and you will undoubtedly return to Rome. If you throw two coins you will find romance and if you throw three you will either get married or divorced.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-trevi-fountain-in-rome-italy>Where is the Trevi Fountain in Rome Italy?</h2>
<p>This masterpiece is located in Rome, Italy in the city’s Trevi District. It is also one of the city’s most well-known landmarks, and it is likely to top the list of any Rome itinerary.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-bernini-touch-in-the-trevi-fountain>Is there a Bernini touch in the Trevi Fountain?</h2>
<p>Though Bernini’s project was never constructed, there are many Bernini touches in the fountain as it exists today.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-was-thrown-into-the-trevi-fountain>How much money was thrown into the Trevi Fountain?</h2>
<p>In 2016, an estimated €1.4 million (US$1.5 million) was thrown into the fountain. The money has been used to subsidize a supermarket for Rome’s needy; however, there are regular attempts to steal coins from the fountain, even though it is illegal to do so. In 1973, the Italian national postal service dedicated a postage stamp to the Trevi Fountain.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-go-to-the-trevi-fountain>When is the best time to go to the Trevi Fountain?</h2>
<p>If you want pictures with the fountain, you might have a chance – but you’ll likely have to wait in line and deal with a lot of teenagers trying to snap 100+ selfies. In my opinion, the absolute best time to visit the Trevi Fountain is early in the morning before the crowds arrive.</p>
