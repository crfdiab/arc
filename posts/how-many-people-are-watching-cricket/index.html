<h2 id=how-many-people-are-playing-cricket-in-india>How many people are playing cricket in India?</h2>
<p>We can never know how many people are playing cricket in India. This nation has a mass population of around 125 crore and I am sure that many of them are fans of this exciting game and many of them do play either for making a professional career in it or just as a friendly game.</p>

<p>Enter the characters shown in the image. Send me a copy: Cricket is the jewel in the crown of rising sports viewership in the country, with 93 per cent of all sports viewers in 2018 tuning to cricket content, and women form a chunk of the audience, according to a BARC India report. As many as 766 million viewers sampled sports content in 2018.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-more-one-day-matches-than-test-matches-in-india>Are there more one day matches than Test matches in India?</h2>
<p>Generally, there has recently been a tendency to play more one-day matches than Test matches. Cricket in India is managed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the richest cricket board in the cricket world, yet, average cricket fans cannot get hold of tickets to see matches, much of which are distributed as largesse.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-cricket-world-cup-won-by-india>When was the last Cricket World Cup won by India?</h2>
<p>The Indian national cricket team won the 1983 Cricket World Cup, the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, and shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka. The 2021 ICC Men’s Twenty20 World Cup & 2023 Cricket World Cup will be hosted by India.</p>
