<h2 id=is-connecticut-northeast-or-southeast>Is Connecticut Northeast or Southeast?</h2>
<p>The Northeast includes Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<h2 id=which-state-is-not-part-of-the-new-england-region>Which state is not part of the New England region?</h2>
<p>Answer: New York While the U.S. state of New York is most certainly, geographically speaking, part of the northeastern U.S., it is not, like its eastern neighbors—Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont—considered part of the “New England” region.</p>
<h2 id=what-part-of-connecticut-is-considered-new-england>What part of Connecticut is considered New England?</h2>
<p>New England is a region located in the northeast corner of the USA. The region is made up of six unique U.S. states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-connecticut-known-for-food>What is Connecticut known for food?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Connecticut is home to countless restaurants as well as food creations that help put the state on the map. Below we’ll list 7 foods that you may or may not like, but are known to have strong ties with CT.</li>
<li>Hot and Buttered Lobster Roll.</li>
<li>Apple Cider Donuts.</li>
<li>Grinders.</li>
<li>Steamed Cheeseburgers.</li>
<li>Local Ice Cream.</li>
<li>Hot Dogs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-is-connecticut-included-in-the-middle-atlantic-region>Why is Connecticut included in the Middle Atlantic region?</h2>
<p>When discussing climate, Connecticut is sometimes included in the region, since its climate is closer to that of the Middle Atlantic states than the rest of the New England states.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-state-of-connecticut-part-of-new-england>Is the state of Connecticut part of New England?</h2>
<p>Connecticut is the state that “let’s be honest, nobody else in the region likes or respects,” Jon Stewart joked last year on The Daily Show. And the humiliating thing is that he was talking about the Mid-Atlantic region. So does Connecticut really even belong in New England? I’ve lived here for 37 years, and probably ought to know.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-states-on-the-east-coast>What are the States on the east coast?</h2>
<p>These states are Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, and Georgia. The name “East Coast” is derived from the geographical location of the states in reference to the conterminous United States.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-mid-atlantic-states-located-in-the-united-states>Where are the Mid Atlantic States located in the United States?</h2>
<p>The Mid-Atlantic, also called Middle Atlantic states or the Mid-Atlantic states, form a region of the United States generally located between New England and the South Atlantic States.</p>
