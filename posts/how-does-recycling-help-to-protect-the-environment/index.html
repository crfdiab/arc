<h2 id=how-does-recycling-help-to-protect-the-environment>How does recycling help to protect the environment?</h2>
<p>When we recycle plastic, we reduce the need for more plastic to be manufactured. By recycling paper, we do our part to lessen deforestation and save trees from being cut down. Separating cans and other metals helps to cut down on damaging mining and our growing need for raw materials. 2. Recycling Saves Energy</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-benefits-of-recycle-and-reuse>What are the benefits of recycle and reuse?</h2>
<p>Recycling saves resources. When we recycle, used materials are converted into new products, reducing the need to consume natural resources. If used materials are not recycled, new products are made by extracting fresh, raw materials from the earth, through mining and forestry.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-we-do-to-help-the-environment>What can we do to help the environment?</h2>
<p>Recycling is just one of many ways to help the environment by reducing the burden of waste on it. Every step counts and is one more towards helping and supporting the environment. Everyone’s involvement is necessary, from kids to adults, to help produce a better environment for many generations to come. Was this page useful? Yes No</p>
<h2 id=how-are-metals-recycled-to-help-the-environment>How are metals recycled to help the environment?</h2>
<p>Metals must be mined from the earth, which damages the areas and environments those mines are dug. Recycling metals can be tricky, as there are dozens of metals. However, the good news for the average person is that most metals can be recycled together, as recycling plants sort them into their respective categories.</p>

<h2 id=how-does-recycling-reduce-water-and-air-pollution>How does recycling reduce water and air pollution?</h2>
<p>Recycling reduces water and air pollution by cutting down the number of pollutants released into the environment. A recycling rate of 30 percent is the equivalent of removing around 30 million cars from the roads. 9. Recycling Prevents Loss of Biodiversity When you get in the habit of recycling products, you need fewer raw materials.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-shredding-and-recycling-paper-help-the-environment>How does shredding and recycling paper help the environment?</h2>
<p>How does shredding and recycling paper help the enviroment? An increasing number of organisations are recognising the environmental and business benefits of recycling their waste.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-you-help-reduce-reuse-and-recycle>How can you help reduce, reuse, and recycle?</h2>
<p>How can you help? You can help by learning about and practicing the three R’s of waste management: Reduce, reuse, and recycle! Practicing all three of these activities every day is not only important for a healthy environment, but it can also be fun too.</p>
