<h2 id=why-have-british-sea-power-changed-their-name>Why have British Sea Power changed their name?</h2>
<p>Indie band British Sea Power has changed their name, in an effort to separate themselves from the “rise in a certain kind of nationalism”. Sea Power, as they will now be known, have been together for about 20 years, and are known for tracks such as Waving Flags, Remember Me and Red Rock Riviera.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-empire-and-sea-power>What was the empire and sea power?</h2>
<p>An empire based on commerce, sea power and naval dominance consolidated British overseas settler societies. At the beginning of the 18th century, Britain possessed colonies along the eastern seaboard of North America, numerous sugar islands in the Caribbean and a foothold in Bengal.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-sea-power-do>What does sea power do?</h2>
<p>The main purpose of sea power has always been to protect friendly shipping from enemy attack and to destroy or hinder the enemy’s shipping—both commercial and military. Naval forces have also been used to bombard land objectives from the sea.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-elements-of-sea-power>What are the elements of sea power?</h2>
<p>He famously listed six fundamental elements of sea power: geographical position, physical conformation, extent of territory, size of population, character of the people, and character of government. Based largely on those factors, Mahan envisioned the United States as the geopolitical successor to the British Empire.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-royal-navy-still-powerful>Is the Royal Navy still powerful?</h2>
<p>From the mid 18th century, the Royal Navy was the world’s most powerful navy. It was an unmatched power and played a key part in ascertaining order in the British Empire. The UK defense budget is still the 5th largest in the world and the Royal Navy remains in the front rank of the world’s navies.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-was-the-first-to-use-sea-power>What country was the first to use sea power?</h2>
<p>The Portuguese Empire<br>
The Portuguese Empire pioneered the Age of Discovery during the 15th. It was the first global sea power, and global empire. It was also the most powerful empire during the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-mahans-theory>What is Mahan’s theory?</h2>
<p>Mahan argued that British control of the seas, combined with a corresponding decline in the naval strength of its major European rivals, paved the way for Great Britain’s emergence as the world’s dominant military, political, and economic power.</p>
