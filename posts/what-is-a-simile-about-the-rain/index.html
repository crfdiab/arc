<h2 id=what-is-a-simile-about-the-rain>What is a simile about the rain?</h2>
<p>Sometimes when the rain is cold and heavy it feels like little daggers on the skin. You might also call it pins from the sky. This is a particularly vivid metaphor (or simile, if you use that term ‘like’ as I did in the previous sentence) because in your mind you can almost see daggers falling from the sky.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-simile-for-the-mountain>What is a simile for the mountain?</h2>
<p>“Up and up the mountains went with pine trees climbing until the cold peaks frosted with virgin white cut off the growth so that the highest heights shone bald, reflecting the sun like a torch; blazing clear, clean light. In places the mountains were so high that the sun seemed to struggle trying to get over them.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-simile-for-heavy>What is the simile for heavy?</h2>
<p>Heavy</p>
<table><tr><td>Heavy as a boarding-house dumpling. —Anonymous</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy as death. —Matthew Arnold</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy as a panegyric. —William Congreve</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy as the hand of death. —Charles Dickens</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Head as heavy as alderman’s. —Henry Fielding</td><td>5</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-metaphor-for-rain>What is the metaphor for rain?</h2>
<p>Examples of rain metaphors include “pouring rain,” “rain washed light,” “rain dancing across the meadow” and “rain soaked skin.” A metaphor is a figure of speech using words in ways that are not literal. For example, rain doesn’t literally pour from the sky, wash light, dance or soak through skin.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-sound-of-the-rain-called>What is the sound of the rain called?</h2>
<p>Because the words are self-explanatory: pitter-patter is the sound of raindrops. The first line describes a drizzle and the second a torrent of rain. Forming words by letters that resemble the sound of the things denoted by them is called onomatopoeia.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-simile-mean-example>What does simile mean example?</h2>
<p>Similes. A simile is a phrase that uses a comparison to describe. For example, “life” can be described as similar to “a box of chocolates.” You know you’ve spotted one when you see the words like or as in a comparison. Similes are like metaphors.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-describe-a-mountain>How do you describe a mountain?</h2>
<p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth’s crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land.</p>

<table><tr><th>as happy as a lark</th><th>very happy</th></tr><tr><td>as straight as an arrow</td><td>straight</td></tr><tr><td>as strong as an ox</td><td>very strong</td></tr><tr><td>as stubborn as a mule</td><td>very stubborn, obstinate</td></tr><tr><td>as sturdy as an oak</td><td>very strong and solid</td></tr></table>

<h2 id=is-the-word-rain-a-metaphor-or-a-simile>Is the word rain a metaphor or a simile?</h2>
<p>Rain Personification. Personification is a type of metaphor because it gives rain personality traits that it doesn’t have. Here, we are still using figurative language and saying that rain is something that it really isn’t. But, we’re mostly giving rain human features here. 9. Rain is Playful</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-use-for-the-simile-as-heavy-as>What can you use for the simile as heavy as?</h2>
<p>What word can you use for the simile as heavy as? – Answers What word can you use for the simile as heavy as?</p>
<h2 id=can-you-use-a-metaphor-to-describe-a-storm>Can you use a metaphor to describe a storm?</h2>
<p>A metaphor, by contrast, is a direct comparison that does not use these words. You can use these devices to create surprising descriptions of your storm. If you’re describing a hailstorm, for example, you might use a simile to write, “The hailstones clattered to the ground like marbles spilled from a box.”</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-metaphor-and-a-simile>What’s the difference between a metaphor and a simile?</h2>
<p>A simile is a type of description that makes an explicit comparison between two things using the words “like” or “as.”. A metaphor, by contrast, is a direct comparison that does not use these words. You can use these devices to create surprising descriptions of your storm.</p>
