<h2 id=what-percent-of-the-world-is-developing-countries>What percent of the world is developing countries?</h2>

<h2 id=how-many-countries-are-considered-developed>How many countries are considered developed?</h2>
<p>The OECD’s 37 members are known as the “developed countries club”. The World Bank identifies 81 “high income countries”. Other standards, such as the 30-50 Club (GDP per capita over $30,000 and population over 50 million) have been developed to categorize highly developed and influential countries.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-is-the-most-developing>What country is the most developing?</h2>
<p>China was the richest developing country on Earth in 2019, with a total GDP of $14,279.94 billion.</p>
<h2 id=is-india-a-developing-country-2020>Is India a developing country 2020?</h2>
<p>The United States used to group India in the category of developing nations. However, at the behest of president Donald Trump, the member countries were shuffled. The WTO allows countries to self-declare as developing nations (or developed/ least-developed countries). India is one of the WTO’s Asian developing members.</p>

<p>Development can be measured by economic or human factors. Developing countries are, in general, countries that have not achieved a significant degree of industrialization relative to their populations, and have, in most cases, a medium to low standard of living. There is an association between low income and high population growth.</p>
