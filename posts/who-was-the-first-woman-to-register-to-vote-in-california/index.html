<h2 id=who-was-the-first-woman-to-register-to-vote-in-california>Who was the first woman to register to vote in California?</h2>
<p>Proposition 4 passed granting women suffrage. Berkeley was the only major city in the San Francisco Bay Area where a majority voted for suffrage. A majority of Chinese voters supported suffrage on the day of the election. In October, Jennie Mary Chamberlain became the first woman to register to vote in Alameda County.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-california-ratify-the-19th-amendment>When did California ratify the 19th Amendment?</h2>
<p>On November 1, 1919, California ratified the 19th Amendment. By August of 1920, 36 states (including California) ratified the 19th Amendment, ensuring that the right to vote could not be denied based on sex.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-womens-movement-split-in-1913>Why did the women’s movement split in 1913?</h2>
<p>The women’s rights movement splits into two factions as a result of disagreements over the Fourteenth and soon-to-be-passed Fifteenth Amendments. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony form the more radical, New York-based National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA).</p>
<h2 id=what-movement-does-the-womens-suffrage-movement-have-a-strong-alliance-with>What movement does the women’s suffrage movement have a strong alliance with?</h2>
<p>A strong alliance is formed with the Abolitionist Movement. Worcester, Massachusetts is the site of the second National Women’s Rights Convention. Participants included Horace Mann, New York Tribune columnist Elizabeth Oaks Smith, and Reverend Harry Ward Beecher, one of the nation’s most popular preachers.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-national-womans-party-still-exist>Does the National Woman’s Party still exist?</h2>
<p>The National Woman’s Party ceased operation as an independent non-profit in 2020. Today, its legacy is maintained by three institutions: the Alice Paul Institute, which holds the NWP trademark and continues its mission to inspire action to advance gender equality.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-womens-suffrage-movement-to-start>What caused the women’s suffrage movement to start?</h2>
<p>The movement for woman suffrage started in the early 19th century during the agitation against slavery. Women such as Lucretia Mott showed a keen interest in the antislavery movement and proved to be admirable public speakers.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-the-womens-suffrage-movement-last>How long did the women’s suffrage movement last?</h2>
<p>The women’s suffrage movement was a decades-long fight to win the right to vote for women in the United States. It took activists and reformers nearly 100 years to win that right, and the campaign was not easy: Disagreements over strategy threatened to cripple the movement more than once.</p>
<h2 id=who-started-womens-suffrage-movement>Who started women’s suffrage movement?</h2>
<p>Elizabeth Cady Stanton<br>
It commemorates three founders of America’s women’s suffrage movement: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucretia Mott.</p>
<h2 id=which-president-signed-the-19th-amendment>Which President signed the 19th Amendment?</h2>
<p>President Woodrow Wilson<br>
On September 30, 1918, President Woodrow Wilson gives a speech before Congress in support of guaranteeing women the right to vote. Although the House of Representatives had approved a 19th constitutional amendment giving women suffrage, the Senate had yet to vote on the measure.</p>
<h2 id=which-party-passed-the-19th-amendment>Which party passed the 19th Amendment?</h2>
<p>On May 21, 1919, the amendment passed the House 304 to 89, with 42 votes more than was necessary. On June 4, 1919, it was brought before the Senate and, after Southern Democrats abandoned a filibuster, 36 Republican Senators were joined by 20 Democrats to pass the amendment with 56 yeas, 25 nays, and 14 not voting.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-national-womans-party-call-themselves>What did the National Woman’s Party call themselves?</h2>
<p>In June 1916 the CU formed the NWP, briefly known as the Woman’s Party of Western Voters. The CU continued in states where women did not have the vote; the NWP existed in western states that had passed women’s suffrage.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-woman-to-be-elected-to-the-california-state-assembly>Who was the first woman to be elected to the California State Assembly?</h2>
<p>In 1918, Grace S. Dorris, Esto B. Broughton, Anna L. Saylor, and Elizabeth Hughes were the first four women to be elected to the California State Assembly; these women were among the first to hold distinguishable roles in state government advocating for women’s rights.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-womens-suffrage-become-legal-in-california>When did women’s suffrage become legal in California?</h2>
<p>California suffragists continued to persevere in the aftermath of the failure of the 1896 proposition. In the late 19th century and through the early 20th century suffragists in California published the Yellow Ribbon suffrage newsletter.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-state-to-pass-womens-suffrage>What was the first state to pass women’s suffrage?</h2>
<p>1887: Rhode Island becomes the first eastern state to vote on a women’s suffrage referendum, but it does not pass. 1888–1889: Wyoming had already granted women voting and suffrage since 1869–70; now they insist that they maintain suffrage if Wyoming joins the Union.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-suffrage-movement-in-california>Who was the leader of the suffrage movement in California?</h2>
<p>One of the major organizers of the suffrage campaign in southern California was Maria de Lopez. Maria Guadalupe Evangelina Lopez, president of the College Equal Suffrage League, served as a Spanish translator for the movement. She also was the first woman to give a speech in Spanish in support of women’s suffrage.</p>
