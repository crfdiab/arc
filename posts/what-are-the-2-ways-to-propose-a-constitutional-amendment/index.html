<h2 id=what-are-the-2-ways-to-propose-a-constitutional-amendment>What are the 2 ways to propose a constitutional amendment?</h2>
<p>The Constitution provides that an amendment may be proposed either by the Congress with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the State legislatures.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-common-way-to-propose-to-amend-the-constitution>Which is the most common way to propose to amend the Constitution?</h2>
<p>a) The most common way to add an amendment to the Constitution would be to propose it by a 2/3 vote of each house of Congress and be ratified by 3/4 of the state legislatures.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-four-methods-to-formally-amend-the-constitution>What are the four methods to formally amend the Constitution?</h2>
<p>There are actually four different ways, but only one is widely used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposal by convention of the states, with ratification by state conventions.</li>
<li>Proposal by convention of the states, with ratification by state legislatures.</li>
<li>Proposal by Congress, with ratification by state conventions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-do-we-change-the-constitution>How do we change the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Article V of the Constitution provides two ways to propose amendments to the document. Amendments may be proposed either by the Congress, through a joint resolution passed by a two-thirds vote, or by a convention called by Congress in response to applications from two-thirds of the state legislatures.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-ways-to-amend-the-constitution>What are the two ways to amend the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Ways to Amend the Constitution. Under Article V of the Constitution, there are two ways to propose and ratify amendments to the Constitution. To propose amendments, two-thirds of both houses of Congress can vote to propose an amendment, or two-thirds of the state legislatures can ask Congress to call a national convention to propose amendments.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-propose-an-amendment>What’s the best way to propose an amendment?</h2>
<p>Again, for the proposed amendments to become effective, 3/4 of the legislatures or conventions must ratify the proposed amendments. To date the first method, proposal by Congress itself, is the only method by which amendments have been proposed. None of the existing amendments have been proposed by a national convention.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-ways-to-ratify-an-amendment>What are two ways to ratify an amendment?</h2>
<p>Under Article V of the Constitution, there are two ways to propose and ratify amendments to the Constitution. To propose amendments, two-thirds of both houses of Congress can vote to propose an amendment, or two-thirds of the state legislatures can ask Congress to call a national convention to propose amendments.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-specific-amendments-written-and-sent-to-the-states>How are specific amendments written and sent to the States?</h2>
<p>Specific amendments are written by the convention and sent to the states for ratification. Even if the proposed amendments come from a convention rather than from Congress, it is Congress which decides whether ratification is to be by state legislatures or state ratifying conventions.</p>
