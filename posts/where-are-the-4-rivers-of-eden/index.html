<h2 id=where-are-the-4-rivers-of-eden>Where are the 4 rivers of Eden?</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:10-14 lists four rivers in association with the garden of Eden: Pishon, Gihon, Hiddekel (the Tigris), and Phirat (the Euphrates). It also refers to the land of Cush—translated/interpreted as Ethiopia, but thought by some to equate to Cossaea, a Greek name for the land of the Kassites.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-four-rivers-in-eden>What were the four rivers in Eden?</h2>
<p>The four rivers of Paradise are the Euphrates, the Tigris, the Gihon and the Pishon. They are first listed in Gen 2:10–14.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-river-hiddekel>Where is the river hiddekel?</h2>
<p>The Hiddekel (Heb: Chiddeqel; Persian: Tigra) was one of four rivers that flowed from the region of the Garden of Eden. This also known as the Tigris. It is said to have been the one that ran towards the east of Assyria (Asshur).</p>

<p>four rivers<br>
Thaddeus’ illustration mentioned above is based on Gen 2:10: “A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers.” They were the Pishon, the Gihon, the Tigris and the Euphrates.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-rivers-are-there-in-the-garden-of-eden>How many rivers are there in the Garden of Eden?</h2>
<p>From the Garden of Eden (paradise) the “head” or beginning of the ONE river divided into four other rivers. Before we get into the details of these four rivers, let’s first explore what we know about the number four.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-river-that-went-out-of-eden>What was the name of the river that went out of Eden?</h2>
<p>10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone. 13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-rivers-in-the-bible>What are the names of the rivers in the Bible?</h2>
<p>The text that discusses these rivers can be found in Genesis 2:10 –14, and reads as follows: A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it separated and became four heads. The name of one is Pishon; that is the one that encompasses all the land of Havilah, where there is gold.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-land-of-havilah-in-the-garden-of-eden>Where was the land of Havilah in the Garden of Eden?</h2>
<p>Michael M. Homan at the Xavier University of Louisiana has suggested the land of Havilah was Nubia, a region located in what is today northern Sudan and southern Egypt. This would mean that the river Pishon was the Nile. Nubia was home to some of Africa’s earliest kingdoms and the land was known for rich deposits of gold.</p>
