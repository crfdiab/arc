<h2 id=how-was-the-conflict-over-the-border-between-maryland-and-pennsylvania-settled>How was the conflict over the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania settled?</h2>
<p>The armed phase of the conflict ended in May 1738 with the intervention of King George II, who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire. A final settlement was not achieved until 1767 when the Mason–Dixon line was recognized as the permanent boundary between the two colonies.</p>
<h2 id=who-settled-a-boundary-dispute-between-maryland-and-pennsylvania>Who settled a boundary dispute between Maryland and Pennsylvania?</h2>
<p>The Penn and Calvert families had hired Mason and Dixon, English surveyors, to settle their dispute over the boundary between their two proprietary colonies, Pennsylvania and Maryland.</p>
<h2 id=what-solved-a-major-conflict-between-the-penns-and-the-calverts-over-the-boundary-between-their-colonies>What solved a major conflict between the Penns and the Calverts over the boundary between their colonies?</h2>
<p>Subsequent disputes Though the legal dispute between the Penns and the Calverts ended when the king signed off on their agreed upon boundaries, and when they later lost their proprietary rights to the colonies, there have been numerous additional legal disagreements over the borders and surveying attempts.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-mason-dixon-line-come-to-be>How did the Mason Dixon line come to be?</h2>
<p>In April 1765, Mason and Dixon began their survey of the more famous Maryland-Pennsylvania line. It was during the Congressional debates leading up to the compromise that the term “Mason-Dixon line” was first used to designate the entire boundary between free states and slave states.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-a-conflict-between-maryland-and-pennsylvania>Why was there a conflict between Maryland and Pennsylvania?</h2>
<p>Memory of the conflict was one of the original reasons that the Calvert and Penn families, the founders of Maryland and Pennsylvania, respectively, paid for the Mason-Dixon line to be surveyed. This shows the strip of land that was being fought over between Maryland and Pennsylvania. (Wikimedia Commons)</p>
<h2 id=how-did-maryland-respond-to-the-pennsylvania-dutch>How did Maryland respond to the Pennsylvania Dutch?</h2>
<p>Maryland responded by getting Thomas Cresap, a man who had been a land agent for the Calvert family of Maryland, to build a settlement by the Susquehanna River. He did so and began doing business with the Pennsylvania Dutch, claiming the taxes they paid for the government of Maryland.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-border-between-pennsylvania-and-maryland>Where was the border between Pennsylvania and Maryland?</h2>
<p>The two colonies began arguing about where the border actually was. In 1724, the British crown told them to work it out politely. Of course, nobody listened. “Despite the Crown’s mandate, Pennsylvania created Lancaster County, clearly extending south of the border as claimed by Maryland,” writes trivia expert Dan Lewis.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonies-dispute-the-40th-parallel>Why did the colonies dispute the 40th parallel?</h2>
<p>However, whoever surveyed the colony made a serious geographical error, since the 40th Parallel was north of Philadelphia—which would have put the growing city in Maryland, not Pennsylvania. The two colonies began arguing about where the border actually was. In 1724, the British crown told them to work it out politely.</p>
