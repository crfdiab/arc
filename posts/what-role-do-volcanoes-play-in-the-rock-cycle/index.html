<h2 id=what-role-do-volcanoes-play-in-the-rock-cycle>What role do volcanoes play in the rock cycle?</h2>
<p>Explanation: magma which can be made of melted sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks. These melted rocks are then turned into igneous rocks. The igneous rocks are then eroded and turned into sedimentary rocks.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-volcanic-eruption-part-of-the-rock-cycle>Is a volcanic eruption part of the rock cycle?</h2>
<p>When a volcano erupts, magma flows out of it. (When magma is on the earth’s surface, it is called lava.) As the lava cools it hardens and becomes igneous rock. As soon as new igneous rock is formed, the processes of weathering and erosion begin, starting the whole cycle over again!</p>
<h2 id=what-does-lava-have-to-do-with-the-rock-cycle>What does lava have to do with the rock cycle?</h2>
<p>Lava cools to form volcanic rock as well as volcanic glass. Magma can also extrude into Earth’s atmosphere as part of a violent volcanic explosion. This magma solidifies in the air to form volcanic rock called tephra.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-rock-is-formed-by-volcanoes-in-the-rock-cycle>What type of rock is formed by volcanoes in the rock cycle?</h2>
<p>Igneous Rocks<br>
Igneous Rocks – Igneous rocks are formed by volcanoes. When a volcano erupts, it spews out hot molten rock called magma or lava. Eventually the magma will cool down and harden, either when it reaches the Earth’s surface or somewhere within the crust. This hardened magma or lava is called igneous rock.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-four-stages-of-the-rock-cycle>What are the four stages of the rock cycle?</h2>
<p>In general, a sedimentary rock is formed in four basic stages: weathering or erosion of pre-existing rock; transportation of the sediment by agents such as water, ice, or wind; deposition of the sediment; and conversion into new rock by processes such as compaction (squeezing together), cementation (binding together), and recrystallization.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-stages-of-rock-cycle>What are the stages of rock cycle?</h2>
<p>Rocks also experience a life cycle during which time rocks change, transform, and move. The rock cycle refers to the stages of the transformation of rocks over long spans of time. Answer and Explanation: The rock cycle stages include: weathering and erosion, transportation, deposition, compaction and cementation, metamorphism, and rock melting.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-steps-in-the-rock-cycle>What are the steps in the rock cycle?</h2>
<p>Schist, slate, and gneiss (pronounced like ‘nice’) are metamorphic rocks. These rocks change over hundreds of years in the six steps of the rock cycle: Weathering & Erosion. Igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks on the surface of the earth are constantly being broken down by wind and water.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-facts-about-the-rock-cycle>What are facts about the rock cycle?</h2>
<p>Facts About the Rock Cycle Changes. The rock cycle describes how the three major types of rock–metamorphic, igneous and sedimentary–can change into one another through various geologic processes, according to Learner.org. Metamorphic rock. Sedimentary rock. Igneous rock. James Hutton. …</p>
