<h2 id=how-is-air-mass-measured>How is air mass measured?</h2>
<p>Relative air mass can be calculated in the field using the length of the shadow cast by a vertical pole. A pole used for this purpose is called a solar gnomon. In Figure AT-AM- 2A, the pathlength through the atmosphere (p) is a function of the elevation angle (e).</p>
<h2 id=can-you-weight-air>Can you weight air?</h2>
<p>The density of air depends on pressure and humidity. 2) You can weight it on a scale. But be very careful about this! The container and the air inside will weigh the same, but the difference in the buoyant force will be the weight of one cubic foot of air.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-air-weight>What causes air weight?</h2>
<p>It might not seem like it, but air has weight. This is because the parcel of air is embedded in surrounding air that has the same density (mass per unit volume). But imagine that we remove that parcel of air from the atmosphere…the atmosphere would then weigh very slightly less.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-quality-of-the-air-measured>How is the quality of the air measured?</h2>
<p>Air quality is measured with the Air Quality Index, or AQI. The AQI works like a thermometer that runs from 0 to 500 degrees. However, instead of showing changes in the temperature, the AQI is a way of showing changes in the amount of pollution in the air. A photograph showing smog over downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-way-to-measure-air-flow>Is there a way to measure air flow?</h2>
<p>The idea of measuring air flow may seem a bit daunting at first. However, you can easily use an anemometer, a balancing hood, or even a box and credit card to simply measure air flow in your home!</p>
<h2 id=how-is-air-volume-measured-in-a-duct>How is air volume measured in a duct?</h2>
<p>Air volume is measured with anemone meter put in the duct. By anemone meter velocity is measured. Multiply cross section area of duct by velocity, gives you volume. Determining air flow is a matter of multiplying the cross sectional area of a duct by the air velocity.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-air-quality-measured-in-los-angeles>How is air quality measured in Los Angeles?</h2>
<p>The AQI works like a thermometer that runs from 0 to 500 degrees. However, instead of showing changes in the temperature, the AQI is a way of showing changes in the amount of pollution in the air. A photograph showing smog over downtown Los Angeles. Air quality is a measure of how clean or polluted the air is.</p>
