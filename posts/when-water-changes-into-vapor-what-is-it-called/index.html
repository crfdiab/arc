<h2 id=when-water-changes-into-vapor-what-is-it-called>When water changes into vapor what is it called?</h2>
<p>Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor. Evaporation is the primary pathway that water moves from the liquid state back into the water cycle as atmospheric water vapor.</p>
<h2 id=are-formed-from-the-droplets-of-water-vapour>Are formed from the droplets of water Vapour?</h2>
<p>Clouds are created when water vapor, an invisible gas, turns into liquid water droplets. These water droplets form on tiny particles, like dust, that are floating in the air. That means some of the liquid water in the towel or bowl changed into an invisible gas called water vapor and drifted away into the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-after-water-vapour-is-in-the-air>What happens after water Vapour is in the air?</h2>
<p>Water evaporates from the Earth’s surface and rises on warm updrafts into the atmosphere. It condenses into clouds, is blown by the wind, and then falls back to the Earth as rain or snow.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-water-vapor-in-the-atmosphere>What happens to water vapor in the atmosphere?</h2>
<p>Condensation is the change of water from its gaseous form (water vapor) into liquid water. Condensation generally occurs in the atmosphere when warm air rises, cools and looses its capacity to hold water vapor. As a result, excess water vapor condenses to form cloud droplets. Click to see full answer.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-formed-when-water-vapor-condenses>What is formed when water vapor condenses?</h2>
<p>Also to know is, what is the process of condensation? Condensation is the process by which water vapor in the air is changed into liquid water. In other words, the water in the air, a gas known as water vapor, from your hot shower cooled when it met the surface of the cold mirror.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-water-molecules-arranged-in-the-vapor-form>How are water molecules arranged in the vapor form?</h2>
<p>Water molecules in the vapor form are arranged more randomly than in liquid water. As condensation occurs and liquid water forms from the vapor, the water molecules become more organized and heat is released into the atmosphere as a result.</p>
