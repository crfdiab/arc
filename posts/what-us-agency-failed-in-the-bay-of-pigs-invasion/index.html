<p>The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and President John F. Kennedy hoped the Bay of Pigs Invasion would result in the overthrow of Cuban leader Fidel Castro. But the operation that unfolded over the next five days became one of the greatest military fiascoes in American history.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-us-do-in-the-bay-of-pigs-invasion>What did the US do in the Bay of Pigs invasion?</h2>
<p>The Bay of Pigs invasion begins when a CIA-financed and -trained group of Cuban refugees lands in Cuba and attempts to topple the communist government of Fidel Castro. Eisenhower ordered the CIA to train and arm a force of Cuban exiles for an armed attack on Cuba.</p>

<p>50 years after Bay of Pigs, JFK is still to blame, historian tells UCF audience. As the 50th anniversary of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba approaches next month, historian Irwin F. Gellman came to UCF Monday night to place the blame for the disaster in the lap of President John F. Kennedy.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-us-agree-not-to-invade-cuba>Did the US agree not to invade Cuba?</h2>
<p>Following this news, many people feared the world was on the brink of nuclear war. However, disaster was avoided when the U.S. agreed to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev’s (1894-1971) offer to remove the Cuban missiles in exchange for the U.S. promising not to invade Cuba.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-bay-of-pigs-invasion-important>Why was the Bay of Pigs Invasion important?</h2>
<p>Kennedy was deeply embarrassed by the Bay of Pigs failure. The Bay of Pigs invasion took place on 17 April 1961. It was an attempt by the US government to overthrow Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba. Since the Cuban revolution in 1959, relations between Cuba and the United States had become strained.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-of-cuba-during-the-bay-of-pigs-invasion>Who was president of Cuba during the Bay of Pigs Invasion?</h2>
<p>On January 1, 1959, a young Cuban nationalist named Fidel Castro drove his guerilla army into Havana and overthrew General Fulgencio Batista (1901-1973), the nation’s American-backed president. For the next two years, officials at the U.S. State Department and the CIA attempted to remove Castro.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-castro-do-after-the-bay-of-pigs-invasion>What did Castro do after the Bay of Pigs Invasion?</h2>
<p>Almost as soon as he came to power, Castro took steps to reduce American influence on the island. He nationalized American-dominated industries such as sugar and mining, introduced land reform schemes and called on other Latin American governments to act with more autonomy.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-cia-train-for-the-bay-of-pigs>Where did the CIA train for the Bay of Pigs?</h2>
<p>Their instructors were from the Army Special Forces, Air Force, Air National Guard, and the CIA. Thirty-nine of the recruits were pilots who had flown in Cuba’s military or as commercial pilots. The pilots were trained at an air training base in Guatemala.</p>
