<h2 id=what-factors-would-most-likely-cause-a-hurricane-to-decrease-strength>What factors would most likely cause a hurricane to decrease strength?</h2>
<p>Four Factors that Can Weaken Tropical Cyclones</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooler Sea surface temperatures less than 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius)</li>
<li>High vertical wind shear.</li>
<li>Dry air.</li>
<li>Land masses along the projected storm track.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-factors-influence-the-intensity-of-a-hurricane>What factors influence the intensity of a hurricane?</h2>
<p>These include, but are not limited to, ocean water temperatures, atmospheric temperatures, air moisture levels, distance from the equator, and wind speeds and directions. Whether or not a tropical cyclone is categorized as a tropical storm or hurricane depends on its maximum sustained wind speed.</p>
<h2 id=what-hurricanes-destroy-hurricanes>What hurricanes destroy hurricanes?</h2>
<p>Strong upper level winds destroy the storms structure by displacing the warm temperatures above the eye and limiting the vertical accent of air parcels. Hurricanes will not form when the upper level winds are too strong. 5. First, dry air causes evaporation of liquid water.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-a-hurricane-crosses-over-land>What happens when a hurricane crosses over land?</h2>
<p>As a hurricane crosses over land, it begins to dissipate, or break apart and reduce in strength. At this point, a hurricane can still cause a lot of damage because of high winds, rain, and flooding, but unless it makes its way back over the open ocean, it is downgraded from a hurricane back to a tropical storm.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-hurricanes-die-out>How do hurricanes die out?</h2>
<p>Explanation: One of the driving forces of a hurricane is heat energy in oceanic surface waters. Warm water evaporates more quickly, and warm air rises. If it moves onto land it loses that warm water source, and so dies down.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-three-causes-of-a-hurricane>What are three causes of a hurricane?</h2>
<p>Causes of a Hurricane The three main components critical to the formation of a hurricane are warm water, moist warm air and light upper winds.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-hurricanes-lose-power-over-land>Why do hurricanes lose power over land?</h2>
<p>Hurricanes may lose strength over land because of cool temperatures, a lack of moisture, and/or friction. Hurricanes form over low pressure regions with warm temperatures over large bodies of water. The warm temperature causes the ocean water to evaporate. The moisture is what fuels a hurricane.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-factors-that-affect-a-hurricane>What are the factors that affect a hurricane?</h2>
<p>Wind speed is just one of many factors that contribute to a hurricane’s impact. Others include its track (the site where the storm makes landfall), size, storm structure, rainfall amount, duration, and the vulnerability of the area it affects.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-wind-speed-decrease-when-a-hurricane-hits-land>How does wind speed decrease when a hurricane hits land?</h2>
<p>This graph shows how rapidly wind speed decreases once a hurricane reaches land. The roughness of the land terrain increases friction, but more critical, once over land, the system is cut off from its heat and moisture sources.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-stronger-a-tropical-cyclone-or-a-hurricane>Which is stronger a tropical cyclone or a hurricane?</h2>
<p>Weaker tropical cyclones might be called “ tropical depressions ” or “ tropical storms .” The National Hurricane Center categorizes Atlantic hurricanes based on wind speed. A storm with winds exceeding 74 mph is a Category 1 hurricane. Storms with winds stronger than 111 mph are considered “major hurricanes” (Category 3 or higher).</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-wind-speed-of-a-category-1-hurricane>What’s the wind speed of a Category 1 hurricane?</h2>
<p>A storm with winds exceeding 74 mph is a Category 1 hurricane. Storms with winds stronger than 111 mph are considered “major hurricanes” (Category 3 or higher). Wind speed is just one of many factors that contribute to a hurricane’s impact.</p>
