<h2 id=what-is-the-most-industrialized-region-in-brazil>What is the most industrialized region in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Notable characteristics: The southeast region is the major powerhouse of the Brazilian economy, responsible for 49% of the Brazilian GDP (approximately US$1024 billion in 2010).</p>
<h2 id=which-region-of-brazil-would-be-considered-the-wealthiest>Which region of Brazil would be considered the wealthiest?</h2>
<p>It is the richest region of the country, responsible for approximately 60% of the Brazilian GDP, as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais are the three richest states of Brazil, the top three Brazilian states in terms of GDP. The Southeast of Brazil also has the highest GDP per capita among all Brazilian regions.</p>
<h2 id=what-region-of-brazil-is-the-poorest>What region of Brazil is the poorest?</h2>
<p>Amapá, Acre and Roraima are the poorest states in the country with 0.59% of the national GDP.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-richest-region-in-brazil>Which is the most richest region in Brazil?</h2>
<p>The Southeast Region is the richest region in Brazil. The region is made up of four states: Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Espírito Santo, and Minas Gerais. The Southeast Region encompasses an area of 924,511.3 square km and has a population of 86.3 million people, which ranks as the fourth largest region by area and the most populated.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-developed-region-of-brazil>Which is the most developed region of Brazil?</h2>
<p>The Central-West Region is currently experiencing rapid development, which was partly the result of shifting Brazil’s national capital from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília in the 1960s. The per capita GDP of the Central-West Region is the second highest, and its economy is mainly dependent on livestock breeding, mining, and tourism.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-population-of-the-south-region-of-brazil>What is the population of the South region of Brazil?</h2>
<p>The South Region has a population of 29.4 million people and a population density of 50 individuals per square km. It is the third most populated and second most densely populated region in Brazil. The region’s total area is less than that of the Minas Gerais state in Southeast Brazil.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-central-west-region-of-brazil>How big is the Central West Region of Brazil?</h2>
<p>The Federal District, which is home to Brasília, the capital city of Brazil, is also part of the region. Located in the heart of the country, the Central-West Region covers an area of 1,612,077.2 square km, which accounts for 18.86% of Brazil’s total land area.</p>
