<p>He thought states should charter banks that could issue money. Jefferson also believed that the Constitution did not give the national government the power to establish a bank. Hamilton disagreed on this point too.</p>
<h2 id=did-federalists-want-to-create-a-national-bank>Did federalists want to create a national bank?</h2>
<p>Hamilton and the Federalists want a national bank because they believe a strong federal government will benefit all the states financially, even as it regulates their freedom to print money. Although Hamilton’s First National Bank was largely successful, Congress decided not to renew the charter 20 years later.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-federalists-argue-for-a-national-bank>Why did federalists argue for a national bank?</h2>
<p>Democratic-Republican leaders felt that Hamilton’s bank would have too much power, and would cause a banking monopoly. He asserted that the establishment of a national bank was “necessary and proper” to aid the government in performing these other financial duties. …</p>
<h2 id=did-jefferson-keep-the-national-bank>Did Jefferson keep the national bank?</h2>
<p>As president, Jefferson nevertheless allowed the Bank to run its course until Hamilton’s charter expired in 1811. Following the War of 1812, a new generation of Jeffersonian Republicans, led by Congressman Henry Clay, rechartered the Bank for another twenty years.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-federalist-party-do-for-a-living>What did the Federalist Party do for a living?</h2>
<p>Known for their support of a strong national government, the Federalists emphasized commercial and diplomatic harmony with Britain following the signing of the 1794 Jay Treaty.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-national-bank-of-the-united-states-created>Why was the National Bank of the United States created?</h2>
<p>Therefore, according to Hamilton, the Constitution implicitly provided the federal government with the power to establish a national bank. President Washington followed Hamilton’s advice. He signed the national bank bill to make it a federal statute, and the First Bank of the United States was chartered for twenty years.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-only-president-to-be-a-federalist>Who was the only president to be a Federalist?</h2>
<p>The only Federalist President was John Adams. George Washington was broadly sympathetic to the Federalist program, but he remained officially non-partisan during his entire presidency. Federalist policies called for a national bank, tariffs and good relations with Great Britain as expressed in the Jay Treaty negotiated in 1794.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-jefferson-veto-the-national-bank-bill>Why did Jefferson veto the National Bank Bill?</h2>
<p>Jefferson claimed that this “necessary and proper” clause could not be interpreted so expansively as to permit the federal government to establish a national bank. In line with his strict construction, or narrow interpretation, of the Constitution, Jefferson advised the President to veto the national bank bill.</p>
