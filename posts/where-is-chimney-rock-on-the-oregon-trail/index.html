<h2 id=where-is-chimney-rock-on-the-oregon-trail>Where is Chimney Rock on the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>Located some twelve miles west of Courthouse and Jailhouse Rock, Chimney Rock was one of the most picturesque landmarks along the Oregon Trail. It signaled the end of the prairies as the trail became more steep and rugged heading west towards the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-important-landmarks-on-the-oregon-trail>What were important landmarks on the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>Some of the best known included Blue Mound in Kansas; Courthouse and Jail rocks, Chimney Rock, and Scotts Bluff in Nebraska; Laramie Peak, Independence Rock, Devil’s Gate, Split Rock, the Wind River Range, and Twin Buttes (near the South Pass) in Wyoming; Three Buttes (near Fort Hall) in Idaho; and Flagstaff Hill and.</p>

<p>The settlers gave a sigh of relief if they reached Independence Rock—a huge granite rock that marked the halfway point of their journey—by July 4 because it meant they were on schedule. So many people added their name to the rock it became known as the “Great Register of the Desert.”</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-mentioned-landmark-in-journals-from-the-pioneers>What is the most mentioned landmark in journals from the pioneers?</h2>
<p>During 1800’s, Chimney Rock served as the most noted landmark along the Oregon, California and Mormon Trails. As the emigrants passed by this rock, most of them noted in their diaries or journals that they were glad to see that they are going the right direction and it spired to the heavens.</p>

<p>Major threats to pioneer life and limb came from accidents, exhaustion, and disease. Crossing rivers were probably the most dangerous thing pioneers did. Swollen rivers could tip over and drown both people and oxen. Such accidents could cause the loss of life and most or all of valuable supplies.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-walk-to-chimney-rock-nebraska>Can you walk to Chimney Rock Nebraska?</h2>
<p>It is very nice, historical information is provided in the visitor center. You can just see people in the early days travelling by covered wagon using this rock as a landmark. It’s worth the drive out to see it. You cannot walk up to the rock, you see it from a distance, not far, and we were glad we stopped in.</p>
