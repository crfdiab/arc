<h2 id=what-are-the-top-risks-to-doing-business-in-latin-america>What are the top risks to doing business in Latin America?</h2>
<p>Same as in 2019, business leaders consider the failure of national governance, profound social instability and unemployment or underemployment as the major risks across the region.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-latin-america-not-develop>Why did Latin America not develop?</h2>
<p>Steep mountains and tropical forests made land transport difficult to impossible. This led to the fragmentation of the Spanish New World empire into many, mostly relatively small countries and hindered the development of trade both between and within countries.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-latin-america-the-most-unequal-region>Why is Latin America the most unequal region?</h2>
<p>In Latin America, the richest 10% of people capture 54% of the national income, making it one of the most unequal regions in the world. But the ability of states to redistribute taxes or facilitate consumption amongst low-income groups may not be enough to sustainably reduce income inequality.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-start-a-business-in-latin-america>How do I start a business in Latin America?</h2>
<p>If you’re considering taking your business to Latin America, follow our top ten tips to maximize your business success.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remember: Latin America is not a country.</li>
<li>Be friendly.</li>
<li>Do business on paper.</li>
<li>Examine your own approach.</li>
<li>Plan price carefully.</li>
<li>Logistics.</li>
<li>Learn the language.</li>
<li>Learn from those who have gone before.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-unequal-country-in-latin-america>What is the most unequal country in Latin America?</h2>
<p>Brazil<br>
Based on the degree of inequality in wealth distribution measured by the Gini coefficient, Brazil was the most unequal country in Latin America as of 2017. Brazil’s Gini coefficient amounted to 53.3, followed by Honduras with 50.5.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-top-risks-to-doing-business-in-latin-america-1>What are the Top Risks to doing business in Latin America?</h2>
<p>What are the top risks to doing business in Latin America? “Failure of national governance”, “unemployment” and “fiscal crises” – all prominently cited as risks by Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) business executives.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-way-to-do-business-in-latin-america>Which is the best way to do business in Latin America?</h2>
<p>Business is strongest when it works together in collaboration with governments and third sector organizations. Initiatives like the World Economic Forum’s Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) can shine a light on the shortcomings that undermine business.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-economy-of-latin-america-doing>How is the economy of Latin America doing?</h2>
<p>Over the past 15 years, Latin American economies have, on average, grown faster than those of developed regions but still lagged far behind the growth of other developing economies. Now growth is coming under further threat from declining fertility rates, an end to the commodity boom, and the risk of increased protectionism.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-lost-decade-in-latin-america>What was the Lost Decade in Latin America?</h2>
<p>Many business leaders in LAC will have first-hand experience of the devastating impact that the 1980s Latin American debt crisis had on business and development in the region. The so-called Lost Decade had damning implications for the growth of the region and it is unsurprising that businesses today are wary of history repeating.</p>
