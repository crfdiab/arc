<p>He was created Duke of York following the death of his elder brother, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale.

Following its capture, New Amsterdam’s name was changed to New York, in honor of the Duke of York, who organized the mission.

<p>The Duke of York is a noble title based on York, an important historic city in northern England. New York state—whose land was also taken from Native Americans into British colonial possession—was also named for him. Signs of Dutch rule in New York City remain, however. Brooklyn and Harlem are named for Dutch towns, for instance.</p>
