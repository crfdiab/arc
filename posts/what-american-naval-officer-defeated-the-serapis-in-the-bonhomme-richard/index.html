<h2 id=what-american-naval-officer-defeated-the-serapis-in-the-bonhomme-richard>What American naval officer defeated the Serapis in the Bonhomme Richard?</h2>
<p>Captain John Paul Jones<br>
Engagement between Bonhomme Richard and Serapis, (Sept. 23, 1779), in the American Revolution, notable American naval victory, won off the east coast of England by Captain John Paul Jones.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-bonhomme-richard-catch-fire>How did the Bonhomme Richard catch fire?</h2>
<p>In May 2012, a civilian shipyard worker intentionally set a fire aboard the attack submarine USS Miami so he could go home early. The ship suffered $700 million in damage and the Navy chose to scrap the aging submarine rather than repair it. The Navy chose to do the same thing with the Bonhomme Richard.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-bonhomme-richard-do>What did Bonhomme Richard do?</h2>
<p>USS Bon Homme Richard (CV-31), was an Essex-class aircraft carrier that saw action at the end of World War II, throughout the Korean War, and through the Vietnam War. USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6), was a Wasp-class amphibious assault ship that was severely damaged by fire in July 2020, and decommissioned in April 2021.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-bonhomme-richard-able-to-defeat-the-serapis>How was the Bonhomme Richard able to defeat the Serapis?</h2>
<p>The famous quote, “I have not yet begun to fight!” was Jones’s response to Pearson’s premature call for Bonhomme Richard to surrender. The battle raged on for three hours as the crew of Bonhomme Richard tenaciously fought Serapis, raking her deck with gunfire.</p>
<h2 id=has-the-bonhomme-richard-been-found>Has the Bonhomme Richard been found?</h2>
<p>The remains of a famous American warship have been found off the coast of Filey in Yorkshire. The USS Bonhomme Richard, which fought in the American War of Independence, was sunk in Flamborough Head in 1779. The warship was captained by naval commander John Paul Jones.</p>
<h2 id=will-bonhomme-richard-be-scrapped>Will Bonhomme Richard Be Scrapped?</h2>
<p>After extensive cleanup and reclamation in the wake of a July inferno, the amphibious assault ship Bonhomme Richard will be decommissioned in San Diego next week before being towed elsewhere to be scrapped, the Navy said in a statement. Then the ship will be towed to a scrapyard, said Cmdr.</p>
<h2 id=will-the-uss-bonhomme-richard-be-replaced>Will the USS Bonhomme Richard Be Replaced?</h2>
<p>The Navy announced Monday the ship will be decommissioned. The U.S. Navy announced Monday it will decommission, rather than repair or repurpose, the USS Bonhomme Richard because of extensive damage from a fire while the vessel was in port.</p>
<h2 id=is-uss-bonhomme-richard-an-aircraft-carrier>Is USS Bonhomme Richard an aircraft carrier?</h2>
<p>USS Bon Homme Richard (CV/CVA-31) was one of 24 Essex-class aircraft carriers completed during or shortly after World War II for the United States Navy. She was the second US Navy ship to bear the name, the first one being named for John Paul Jones’s famous Revolutionary War frigate by the same name.</p>
<h2 id=will-the-bonhomme-richard-be-saved>Will the Bonhomme Richard Be Saved?</h2>
<p>The U.S. Navy has announced the USS Bonhomme Richard, a large deck amphibious warship that was severely damaged last summer in a catastrophic fire, won’t be rebuilt and returned to service.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-captain-of-the-serapis-ship>Who was the captain of the Serapis ship?</h2>
<p>The duel took place on September 23, 1779. The Serapis was a 50 gun ship that outgunned the Bonne Homme Richard which was barely sea worthy. When the captain of the Serapis hailed the Bonne Homme Richard and demanded surrender, John Paul Jones answered:” Surrender be dammed, I have not begun to fight.”</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-hms-serapis-during-the-revolutionary-war>Where was the HMS Serapis during the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>Randall & Brent built her at Greenland South Dockyard, Rotherhithe and launched her in 1779. She was armed with 44 guns (twenty 18-pounders, twenty 9-pounders, and four 6-pounders). Serapis was named after the god Serapis in Greek and Egyptian mythology. The Americans captured her during the American Revolutionary War.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-the-battle-of-serapis-last>How long did the Battle of Serapis last?</h2>
<p>The battle raged on for three hours as the crew of Bonhomme Richard tenaciously fought Serapis, raking her deck with gunfire. Eventually, USS Alliance, a frigate in Jones’s squadron, began firing at both the attached ships indiscriminately.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-serapis-lost-in-the-indian-ocean>Why was the Serapis lost in the Indian Ocean?</h2>
<p>The French commissioned Serapis as a privateer under a master named Roche who planned to use the ship against the British in the Indian Ocean. However, in July 1781 the ship was lost off the coast of Madagascar when a sailor accidentally dropped a lantern into a tub of brandy.</p>
