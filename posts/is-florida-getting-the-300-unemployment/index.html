<h2 id=is-florida-getting-the-300-unemployment>Is Florida getting the $300 unemployment?</h2>
<p>On June 26, Florida cut off extra $300 weekly unemployment payments through the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation Program. The state made the decision to opt out of that additional benefit as part of its “Return to Work” initiative, a move Horne hopes will bring more workers through his doors.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-claim-weeks-for-florida-unemployment>How do you claim weeks for Florida unemployment?</h2>
<p>After you submit the first week, you will need to click the “Request Benefits” button to claim any additional weeks. You will be able to request benefit payment for each week available. You will be prompted to answer a series of questions for each applicable week.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-still-have-to-claim-your-weeks-for-unemployment-in-florida>Do you still have to claim your weeks for unemployment in Florida?</h2>
<p>Pursuant to federal law, claimants will be required to return to the CONNECT system every two weeks to request their benefits or “claim their weeks.” In doing so, claimants will confirm that they are still unemployed and acknowledge that you are able and available for work.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-know-if-my-florida-unemployment-claim-was-approved>How do I know if my Florida unemployment claim was approved?</h2>
<p>If your claim is accepted, it will take two to four weeks to receive your first payment. The week you file your claim is a “waiting week” during which no benefits are paid. If you do not receive a confirmation notice, call the Claims Assistance Center toll free at 1-800-204-2418.</p>
<h2 id=what-time-does-unemployment-direct-deposit-hit-your-account-in-florida>What time does unemployment direct deposit hit your account in Florida?</h2>
<p>The normal standard is that it will be available by 9AM on that day. If this is a Monday, the deposit may hit Saturday AM or possibly may not hit until Monday AM.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-get-paid-for-unemployment-in-florida>When do you get paid for unemployment in Florida?</h2>
<p>No benefits are paid the first week you file you claim because it is a “waiting week”. The DES requires that you maintain your eligibility status while you receive benefits. To make sure you remain eligible, the state requires that you request a benefit payment every two weeks.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-maximum-weekly-unemployment-benefit-in-florida>What is the maximum weekly unemployment benefit in Florida?</h2>
<p>In Florida, your weekly benefit amount is calculated by dividing your total earnings for the highest paid quarter of the base period by 26, up to a current maximum of $275 per week. You can receive benefits for anywhere between 12 to 23 weeks, depending on Florida’s current unemployment rate.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-collect-unemployment-after-being-fired-in-florida>Can you collect unemployment after being fired in Florida?</h2>
<p>Collecting Unemployment After Being Fired If you are fired for a reason like not being good at the job or not having the skills to perform the job, you should be able to collect benefits. But in Florida, employees who are fired for misconduct connected with work may not qualify for unemployment benefits.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-responsible-for-collecting-unemployment-in-florida>Who is responsible for collecting unemployment in Florida?</h2>
<p>Here are the basic rules for collecting unemployment in Florida; the state calls these benefits “reemployment assistance.” In Florida, the agency responsible for unemployment benefits is called the Department of Economic Opportunity.</p>
