<p>Mission San Diego de Alcalá<br>
Franciscan priest Father Junipero Serra founded the first mission in 1769. This was known as Mission San Diego de Alcalá and was located in present-day San Diego.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-first-californians>Who were the first Californians?</h2>
<p>The Spaniards, of course, were hardly the first to discover this land of wonder and extremes. The earliest Californians were adventurous Asians who made their way across the Bering Straits to Alaska thousands of years ago when a warmer climate and a now-vanished land bridge made such travel easier.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-missionaries-do-in-california>What did the missionaries do in California?</h2>

<p>At San Diego, Serra founded the first of 21 Spanish missions that extend along the California coast. In October of the same year, a detachment of the expedition saw San Francisco Bay. The missions were an important aspect of Spanish colonization.</p>

The incorporation of the San Francisco Bay Area into Spanish California began when Juan Bautista de Anza created the first overland trail to California from New Spain on two trips in 1774 and 1776, the second of which led to the founding of Mission San Francisco de Asis and Presidio San Francisco.</p>
