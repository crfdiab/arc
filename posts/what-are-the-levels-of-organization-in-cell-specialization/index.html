<h2 id=what-are-the-levels-of-organization-in-cell-specialization>What are the levels of organization in cell specialization?</h2>
<p>Most organisms have functional parts with five levels: cells, tissues, organs, organ systems and whole organisms.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-cell-cell-specialization>What is a cell cell specialization?</h2>
<p>Cell specialization, also known as cell differentiation, is the process by which generic cells change into specific cells meant to do certain tasks within the body. In adults, stem cells are specialized to replace cells that are worn out in the bone marrow, brain, heart and blood.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-5-levels-of-organization-in-organisms>What are the 5 levels of organization in organisms?</h2>
<p>The biological levels of organization of living things arranged from the simplest to most complex are: organelle, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, populations, communities, ecosystem, and biosphere.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-specialized-cells-organized>How are specialized cells organized?</h2>
<p>Groups of specialized cells cooperate to form a tissue, such as a muscle. Different tissues are in turn grouped together to form larger functional units, called organs. Each type of cell, tissue, and organ has a distinct structure and set of functions that serve the organism as a whole.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-example-of-cell-specialization>What is an example of cell specialization?</h2>
<p>Red Blood Cells For one, red blood cells (also referred to as erythrocytes) are a specialized type of blood cells that are characterized by their lack of nucleus. Inside their cytoplasm, they have the pigment hemoglobin which can combine with oxygen, resulting to the formation of oxyhemoglobin.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-examples-of-specialized-cells>What are 3 examples of specialized cells?</h2>
<p>Nerve cells, blood cells, and reproductive cells are examples of specialized cells. Nerve cells, called neurons, have long connections that help them transmit messages throughout our nervous system.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-examples-of-specialized-cells>What are some examples of specialized cells?</h2>
<h2 id=what-are-5-specialized-cells>What are 5 specialized cells?</h2>
<p>Specialised cells in animals and plants</p>

<h2 id=how-are-cell-specialisation-and-organism-organisation-related>How are cell specialisation and organism organisation related?</h2>
<p>Cell Specialisation and Organism Organisation Multicellular organismscontain a wide range of different cells. Every cell is specialisedto perform its functionas best as possible. There are many differences between different cells specialised for different functions.</p>

<p>Cellular Organization: Exploring The Cell 1 What is Cellular Organization? 2 Functional Components Of The Cell 1. Nucleus 2. Cell Membrane (also Plasma Membrane) 3. Cytoplasm 4. Cell Wall 5. Mitochondrion 6. Chloroplast 7. Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum 8. 3 Cell Shape And Size 4 References</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-cell-specialization-in-animals>Which is an example of cell specialization in animals?</h2>
<p>Another specialized cells in animals are the muscle cells which generally have spindle-shaped cell body containing numerous mitochondria. Such specialization enables the muscle cells to perform their function during the contraction and relaxation of muscles in order to produce movements.</p>
