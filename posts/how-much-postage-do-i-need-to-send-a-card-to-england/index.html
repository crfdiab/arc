<h2 id=how-much-postage-do-i-need-to-send-a-card-to-england>How much postage do I need to send a card to England?</h2>
<p>First-Class Mail International® (FCMI) service is the most affordable way to send letters and lightweight packages to more than 190 countries, including Canada and Great Britain. Send 1 oz letters or postcards around the world with one Global Forever® stamp, which currently costs $1.20.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-mail-a-standard-christmas-card>How much does it cost to mail a standard Christmas card?</h2>
<p>When you are sending greeting cards through USPS, a typical card can be mailed for the cost of 1 postage stamp. In 2021, a 1-oz First-Class Mail postage stamp costs $0.55 at the Post Office. Look up the postage stamp retail rate.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-post-a-card-from-australia-to-uk>How much does it cost to post a card from Australia to UK?</h2>
<p>Australia charges $1 (£0.62) for domestic postcards, and $2.75 (£1.71) for postcards sent beyond New Zealand or Asia. USA charges $0.38 (£0.28) for postcards sent domestically, but $1.15 (£0.95) for everywhere else.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-postage-for-a-57-christmas-card>What is the postage for a 5×7 Christmas card?</h2>
<p>A rectangular 5×7 envelope is the standard size that is used in the United States for mailing letters and invitations, so if your envelopes are within the weight range of 1 oz, then you will only need to pay $. 47 for each one without any additional charge.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-use-a-forever-stamp-on-a-christmas-card>Can I use a forever stamp on a Christmas card?</h2>
<p>Important Caveats: The USPS only has Christmas-themed stamps for one ounce letters (“forever” or $0.55 stamps). The rates above are only valid for domestic mail.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-stamp-on-a-postcard>How much is a stamp on a postcard?</h2>
<p>Add 21-cents for each additional ounce. If you are mailing the card from a country outside the U.S., you will have to use stamps from that country, and the rates will vary from country to country. How big/heavy is the card? Postcards have a cheaper “postcard rate forever” stamp just for them. (as of this answer $0.35)</p>
