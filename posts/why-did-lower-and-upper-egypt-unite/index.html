<h2 id=why-did-lower-and-upper-egypt-unite>Why did Lower and Upper Egypt unite?</h2>
<p>This soil allowed the people that lived in “Lower Egypt” to cultivate a civilization and accumulate wealth, making them as rich as the soil the Nile provided. It was this rich and beautiful land that Menes established the first dynasty of Egypt, uniting the Nile River valley’s Upper and Lower Egypt.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-two-halves-of-ancient-egypt-unite>When did the two halves of ancient Egypt unite?</h2>
<p>3100 BCE<br>
The historical record of the unification is murky and filled with inconsistencies, half-truths, and possible legends. In all likelihood, in 3100 BCE, the King Mena (sometimes also known as Narmer) unified the two areas, most likely through military force (either threatened or actually deployed).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-unification-of-upper-and-lower-egypt-start>When did the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt start?</h2>
<p>The unification of these kingdoms started the true era of ancient Egyptian history, and in this lesson we’ll talk about what we know about this, as well as what we don’t. When we talk about ancient Egypt, we’re often talking about a period in which pharaohs ruled as kings over a vast empire, starting around 2686 BCE.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-who-united-upper-and-lower-egypt>Who was the king who united Upper and Lower Egypt?</h2>
<p>Ancient Egyptian tradition credited Menes, now believed to be the same as Narmer, as the king who united Upper and Lower Egypt. On the Narmer Palette the king is depicted wearing the Red Crown in one scene and the White crown in another, and thereby showing his rule over both Lands.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-egypt-unified-into-a-single-kingdom>When was Egypt unified into a single kingdom?</h2>
<p>Narmer palette, front side Ancient Egypt was divided into two kingdoms about 3100 BC: Upper and Lower Egypt which were unified into a single kingdom by Menes about 3000 BC. According to Egyptian priest Manetho who lived in the 3rd century BC the 1st dynasty starts with Menes who made Memphis the capital of unified Egypt.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-king-menes-unite-lower-and-upper-egypt>How did King Menes unite lower and Upper Egypt?</h2>
<p>King Menes is credited with unifying Egypt into one peaceful empire as he was able to unite lower and upper Egypt into one single unified country through a massive battle across Egypt.</p>
