<h2 id=is-it-worth-it-to-use-a-travel-agent>Is it worth it to use a travel agent?</h2>
<p>Travel agents are useful if you’re doing a very costly or complex trip, planning a honeymoon or something fancy, or traveling with a large group. They are also perfect for people who just don’t want to handle a big, complicated trip themselves. Travel agents offer them peace of mind.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-travel-agents-charge-a-service-fee>Why do travel agents charge a service fee?</h2>
<p>Before diving into some pros and cons of charging fees, a quick primer: A service fee is a charge for making a transaction such as booking a hotel, a cruise, an airline ticket or a package; it allows an agent to compensate for bookings with low or no commission.</p>
<h2 id=do-travel-agents-charge-a-fee-uk>Do travel agents charge a fee UK?</h2>
<p>The trade association, ABTA, of which Travel Trolley is a member, says: “Travel agents may charge an admin fee to cover the cost of the work they have done in relation to a cancelled booking. However, these fees must be reasonable and clearly set out in their terms and conditions.</p>
<h2 id=why-use-a-travel-agent-instead-of-booking-online-uk>Why use a travel agent instead of booking online UK?</h2>
<p>From guaranteeing your hotel is available to knowing if the excursion company is legitimate, booking through a travel agent ensures travelers will not get duped. And they provide insurance for medical emergencies and trip cancellations. They’re there 24/7. Travel agents are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-travel-agents-charge-to-book-flights>What do travel agents charge to book flights?</h2>
<p>Service fees could include a $25 to $50 fee per airline ticket, or up to $500 for full itinerary design and booking. Some agents charge by the hour, but not all agencies charge service fees.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-advantage-of-having-a-travel-agent>What is the advantage of having a travel agent?</h2>
<p>In most cases, travel agents have access to information about rates and routes that average consumer might not have, saving you time and money, even when you consider the agent’s fee. Using a travel agent can also help you score a great deal on a package or promotion.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-a-travel-agent>How much does it cost to get a travel agent?</h2>
<p>Agent fees can be broken down into three categories: Some travel agents charge a research fee that ranges from $100 to upwards of $500, depending on your needs, according to Travel + Leisure. This fee covers the time spent searching for and curating a list of possible hotels, flights, restaurants, and activities based on your budget and interests.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-some-travel-agents-not-charge-fees>Why do some travel agents not charge fees?</h2>
<p>For some agents, charging no fees is a part of their marketing platform––a way to sell themselves to clients. Others just don’t feel like it or don’t feel comfortable charging fees. For others, they express that the commissions they receive provide ample enough income and just don’t need to charge them.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fee-structure-do-travel-agents-use>What kind of fee structure do travel agents use?</h2>
<p>Tiffany has a background working for a luxury lifestyle company and is accustomed to clients who expect white-glove service. I chatted with Tiffany (while she was packing for a huge FAM trip to Thailand no less!) and she shared some great insights about developing her fee structure.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-hire-a-travel-advisor>How much does it cost to hire a travel advisor?</h2>
<p>Travel advisor Betsy Donley of Camelback Odyssey charges a $250 “Plan to Go” research fee, which is not applicable to the trip, however, she “discuss [es] the trip with the client and gives them an outline of a plan before charging the fee.”</p>
