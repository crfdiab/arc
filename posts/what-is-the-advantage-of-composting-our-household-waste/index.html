<h2 id=what-is-the-advantage-of-composting-our-household-waste>What is the advantage of composting our household waste?</h2>
<p>Benefits of Composting Enriches soil, helping retain moisture and suppress plant diseases and pests. Reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. Encourages the production of beneficial bacteria and fungi that break down organic matter to create humus, a rich nutrient-filled material.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-better-to-use-a-compost-heap>Why is it better to use a compost heap?</h2>
<p>You can use a compost heap to recycle all your kitchen and garden waste into rich, organic compost that’s great for the soil and plants. Compost can be used to improve the soil structure and drainage, as a mulch to cut down on water loss, and as a fertiliser to improve the soil’s fertility.</p>
<h2 id=what-household-waste-could-you-put-on-a-compost-heap>What household waste could you put on a compost heap?</h2>
<p>Put the right stuff in Good things to compost include vegetable peelings, fruit waste, teabags, plant prunings and grass cuttings. These are fast to break down and provide important nitrogen as well as moisture. It’s also good to include things such as cardboard egg boxes, scrunched up paper and fallen leaves.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-better-environmentally-for-food-scraps-to-decompose-in-a-compost-pile-instead-of-a-landfill>Why is it better environmentally for food scraps to decompose in a compost pile instead of a landfill?</h2>
<p>Benefits of Composting Organic waste in landfills generates, methane, a potent greenhouse gas. By composting wasted food and other organics, methane emissions are significantly reduced. Compost reduces and in some cases eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers. Compost promotes higher yields of agricultural crops.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-worth-having-a-compost-bin>Is it worth having a compost bin?</h2>
<p>It’s easy to make and use. New research has found that almost half of the food waste in the average rubbish bin could have been composted. There are lots of good reasons to compost. It saves money, saves resources, can help to improve your soil and can reduce your impact on the environment.</p>
<h2 id=can-cooked-pasta-go-in-compost>Can cooked pasta go in compost?</h2>
<p>You can add both cooked and uncooked pasta to your compost bin. However, some people prefer not to compost pasta because it can attract unwanted pests. To avoid this, bury any pasta deep in the middle of your pile and cover it with carbon-rich materials.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-way-to-turn-a-compost-heap>Which is the best way to turn a compost heap?</h2>
<p>Although turning the heap is the best method to ensure there is sufficient air, there are a number of easier methods. The first is to mix the material around in the bin using a garden fork or compost aerator. The second is to use a broom handle to poke holes in the material creating air channels.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-composting-at-home>What do you need to know about composting at home?</h2>
<p>Your compost pile should have an equal amount of browns to greens. You should also alternate layers of organic materials of different-sized particles. The brown materials provide carbon for your compost, the green materials provide nitrogen, and the water provides moisture to help break down the organic matter. What To Compost Fruits and vegetables</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-at-the-bottom-of-a-compost-bin>What happens at the bottom of a compost bin?</h2>
<p>Depending on the size of the bin and amount of material that is put into it, it may well be that the material at the bottom of a compost bin is ready for use while there is still room to add new material at the top. If the compost is brown, smells earthly sweet and you can no longer recognise the materials you put in, then it is ready.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-to-compost-what-we-throw-away>Why do we need to compost what we throw away?</h2>
<p>Food scraps and yard waste together currently make up about 30 percent of what we throw away, and should be composted instead. Making compost keeps these materials out of landfills where they take up space and release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.</p>
