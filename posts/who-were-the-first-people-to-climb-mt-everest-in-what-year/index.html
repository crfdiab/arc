<h2 id=who-were-the-first-people-to-climb-mt-everest-in-what-year>Who were the first people to climb Mt Everest in what year?</h2>
<p>Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay – 1953 Everest. Edmund Hillary (left) and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay reached the 29,035-foot summit of Everest on May 29, 1953, becoming the first people to stand atop the world’s highest mountain.</p>
<h2 id=who-climbed-mount-everest-twice-first>Who climbed Mount Everest twice first?</h2>
<p>Nawang Gombu<br>
One of the group, Nawang Gombu, became the first person ever to climb Mount Everest twice, having first accomplished the feat on the U.S. expedition.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-black-african-to-summit-mount-everest>Who was the first black African to summit Mount Everest?</h2>
<p>South Africans who made history on Everest. Sibusiso Vilane, left, a game ranger, became the first black African to summit Mount Everest. Seen here with team leader Robert Anderson. Controversy and camaraderie, as well as tragedy and triumph, coloured the two very different summits by South African teams on the world’s greatest mountain.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-second-south-african-woman-to-climb-everest>Who was the second South African woman to climb Everest?</h2>
<p>Not only is she now the second South African woman to climb Everest, she is also the first South African – indeed, African – woman to have climbed the Seven Summits, the highest peaks on each of the world’s seven continents.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-south-african-climb>Who was the leader of the South African climb?</h2>
<p>The team leader, Ian Woodall, 39, reached the summit alone at 6:07 A.M. Saturday, South African time, or about 9:30 A.M. in Nepal. He reported that the only woman on the team, Cathy O’Dowd, 27, was about 15 minutes behind him and that he wasn’t sure how far back the last member, Bruce Herrod, 37, was.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-south-african-flag-on-mount-everest>Is the South African flag on Mount Everest?</h2>
<p>South Africans have been glued to radios for three days listening to a distant drama of national triumph crumble into an inexplicable tragedy. At dawn on Saturday, they heard that the South African flag had been planted atop Mount Everest for the first time — a successful end to a much-publicized trek.</p>
