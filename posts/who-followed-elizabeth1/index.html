<p>James VI of Scotland<br>
She died at Richmond Palace on 24 March 1603, having become a legend in her lifetime. The date of her accession was a national holiday for two hundred years. James VI of Scotland was Elizabeth’s successor and became James I of England.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-queen-of-england-in-1590>Who was Queen of England in 1590?</h2>
<p>Elizabeth I<br>
Sometimes called the Virgin Queen, Gloriana or Good Queen Bess, Elizabeth was the last of the five monarchs of the House of Tudor….</p>
<table><tr><th>Elizabeth I</th></tr><tr><td>Predecessors</td><td>Mary I and Philip</td></tr><tr><td>Successor</td><td>James I</td></tr><tr><td>Born</td><td>7 September 1533 Palace of Placentia, Greenwich, England</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>24 March 1603 (aged 69) Richmond Palace, Surrey, England</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=is-the-current-queen-elizabeth-related-to-the-first-queen-elizabeth>Is the current Queen Elizabeth Related to the first Queen Elizabeth?</h2>
<p>Put another way, Queen Elizabeth II is related to Queen Elizabeth I through a common ancestor: King Henry VII. That means that Queen Elizabeth II is the first cousin of Elizabeth I, either 13 or 14 times removed, depending on whom you ask.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-tudors-related-to-queen-elizabeth>How are the Tudors related to Queen Elizabeth?</h2>
<p>While there is no direct line between the two, the modern royals have a distant connection to the Tudors. They owe their existence to Queen Margaret of Scotland, grandmother of Mary Queen of Scots, and King Henry VIII’s sister. He said by his reckoning the Queen has 1/32,768th part of Queen Margaret’s blood.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-heir-to-the-throne-of-england-after-elizabeth-i>Who was the heir to the throne of England after Elizabeth I?</h2>
<p>Succession to Elizabeth I of England. The succession to the childless Elizabeth I of England was an open question from her accession in 1558 to her death in 1603, when the crown passed to James VI of Scotland.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-elizabeth-i-and-mary-queen-of-scots>Who are Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots?</h2>
<p>Queen Elizabeth I of England and Mary, Queen of Scots were two of the greatest, most legendary rivals in recorded history—although they never even met. In one castle was Elizabeth, the childless …</p>
<h2 id=who-was-pushing-for-the-succession-to-elizabeth-i>Who was pushing for the succession to Elizabeth I?</h2>
<p>The Spanish diplomat Álvaro de la Quadra, on whose accounts the early intrigues round the succession have been reconstructed, considered that Robert Dudley, brother-in-law to Hastings, was pushing the Queen in March 1560 to make Hastings her successor, against his wishes. There were also some pretensions from his relations in the Pole family.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-william-shakespeare-and-elizabeth-i-meet>How did William Shakespeare and Elizabeth I meet?</h2>
<p>It seems ‘very likely’ that Shakespeare and Elizabeth I met… But they probably weren’t friends. So, did Shakespeare and Elizabeth meet? The answer is: probably.</p>
