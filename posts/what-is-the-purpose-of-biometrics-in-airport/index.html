<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-biometrics-in-airport>What is the purpose of biometrics in airport?</h2>
<p>When you arrive at the airport, biometric technology is helping to automate the verification process, meaning that you move swiftly and safely through border control. It’s all about airlines delivering the best possible passenger experience for you.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-airport-biometrics-work>How do airport biometrics work?</h2>
<p>Biometric screening or facial scanning is designed to verify travelers’ identities by cross-checking facial scans with passport photos already on file. Basically, a camera takes your picture and U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP) matches it to a photo Homeland Security already has of you.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-using-biometrics>What is the purpose of using biometrics?</h2>
<p>Biometrics is the measurement and statistical analysis of people’s unique physical and behavioral characteristics. The technology is mainly used for identification and access control or for identifying individuals who are under surveillance.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-biometrics>What is meant by biometrics?</h2>
<p>For a quick biometrics definition: Biometrics are biological measurements — or physical characteristics — that can be used to identify individuals. For example, fingerprint mapping, facial recognition, and retina scans are all forms of biometric technology, but these are just the most recognized options.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-biometric-screening>What is a biometric screening?</h2>
<p>Biometric screenings are short health exams that include bloodwork and measurements like height, weight, and waist circumference. They’ve grown in popularity in recent years, with more than 50 percent of large firms offering some type of screening program in 2014.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-biometrics-used-in-travel>How are biometrics used in travel?</h2>
<p>In the last post we looked at airports using biometric tech to identify travellers. Typically this is with fingerprint, facial or iris recognition and it speeds up passenger journeys through checkpoints like passport control or boarding gates by up to 40%. It’s not just airports, though.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-biometrics>What are the disadvantages of biometrics?</h2>
<p>Disadvantages of biometric authentication</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs – Significant investment needed in biometrics for security.</li>
<li>Data breaches – Biometric databases can still be hacked.</li>
<li>Tracking and data – Biometric devices like facial recognition systems can limit privacy for users.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-3-examples-of-biometrics>What are 3 examples of biometrics?</h2>
<p>Types of Biometrics</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DNA Matching. The identification of an individual using the analysis of segments from DNA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eyes – Iris Recognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Face Recognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finger Geometry Recognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hand Geometry Recognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typing Recognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id=voice--speaker-identification-what-are-examples-of-biometrics>Voice – Speaker Identification. What are examples of biometrics?</h2>
<p>Examples of Biometric Security</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Voice Recognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fingerprint Scanning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facial Recognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iris Recognition.</p>
</li>

<h2 id=heart-rate-sensors-what-happens-after-i-do-my-biometrics>Heart-Rate Sensors. What happens after I do my biometrics?</h2>
<p>Once you have completed your biometrics appointment, you will be given a stamp on your appointment notice confirming that you attended. Keep this document safe. It serves as proof if USCIS cannot find its record stating that you attended the appointment. The next step depends on the type of application you filed.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-pass-a-biometric-screening>How do I pass a biometric screening?</h2>
<p>How to Prepare for a Biometric Screening</p>
<ol>
<li>Stay calm and act natural.</li>
<li>Fast (if you can).</li>
<li>Pay attention to sugar.</li>
<li>Limit the drinks.</li>
<li>Try not to stress.</li>
<li>Know your meds.</li>
<li>Understand your results.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-are-biometrics-for-a-visa>What are biometrics for a visa?</h2>
<p>What are Biometrics? Biometrics is a term given to unique physiological characteristics that aid automatic recognition, any part of you that can provide a DNA sample would be considered a Biometric. They are required for any UK visa application for a visa for longer than 6 months.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-biometric-recognition-at-airports>Why do we need biometric recognition at airports?</h2>
<p>The airport should provide the necessary know-how and flexibilityto achieve the integration, automation and interoperability of security systems, based on biometric recognition technology. This technology should support smooth facilitation and passenger flow within the terminal.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-biometric-boarding-at-an-airport>Which is an example of biometric boarding at an airport?</h2>
<p>The white paper outlines the paperless biometric boarding trials out of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and MCO, challenges the current liabilities that airlines hold when a government-run identity management system is being used to process passengers, and sets out a vision for the future airport experience.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-biometrics-at-orlando-international-airport>Are there any Biometrics at Orlando International Airport?</h2>
<p>Orlando International Airport (MCO) is now working with SITA to integrate Smart Path technology at 30 international boarding gates. Earlier this year, GOAA, SITA, British Airways and CBP partnered to incorporate the US biometric departure check for British Airways’ customers.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-biometrics-the-future-of-passenger-travel>Is the Biometrics the future of passenger travel?</h2>
<p>“We believe biometrics is the future of passenger travel,” said to Chris Forrest, vice president of airports systems at Collins Aerospace. The company currently has biometrics trials underway with JetBlue Airways at John F. Kennedy International (JFK) in New York and a trial with the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).</p>
