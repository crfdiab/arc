<h2 id=how-dangerous-is-it-to-work-in-iraq>How dangerous is it to work in Iraq?</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of State warns that those traveling and working in Iraq are subject to a high risk of injury or death from terrorist violence, kidnapping, improvised explosives, and other attacks. Those groups responsible include insurgents and terrorist organizations like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.</p>
<h2 id=what-parts-of-iraq-are-safe>What parts of Iraq are safe?</h2>
<p>Though traveling to areas like Basra, Najaf, Karbala, and the majority of Kurdistan is safe, and the north-east provinces which comprise Iraqi Kurdistan can be considered somewhat safe, you should still travel to this country only in cases of absolute necessity.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-syria-not-safe>Why is Syria not safe?</h2>
<p>The security situation in Syria is extremely dangerous due to military conflict, including air strikes, and very high levels of violence, terrorism and kidnapping. Chemical weapons could be used in conflicts. If you’re in Syria despite our advice, avoid possible terrorist targets.</p>
<h2 id=do-americans-need-visa-to-iraq>Do Americans need visa to Iraq?</h2>
<p>A Passport (valid for at least six months) and visa are required for most private American citizens who plan to visit Iraq. Travelers should not rely on obtaining a visa upon arrival at an airport or port of entry in Iraq.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-travel-to-iraq-at-this-time>Is it safe to travel to Iraq at this time?</h2>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you do not travel to Iraq at this time. Terrorist groups make transportation through the country rather difficult. You might get pulled over at any second. Air traffic isn’t safe either. In January 2015, a commercial flight arriving into Baghdad International Airport was fired upon by the rebels.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-get-a-job-in-iraq>Where can you get a job in Iraq?</h2>
<p>The country’s construction industry is where the highest number of expat jobs can be found, with Iraq desperate for knowledgeable expats keen to help restore the country to its former glory.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-safest-province-to-work-in-iraq>Which is the safest province to work in Iraq?</h2>
<p>The Basra Governerate is one of the safest Governerates in Republic of Iaq and Basra is the oil rich province of Iraq. If you are a worker for any company, the company will provide the accommodation and you won’t be allowed to stay putside.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-pay-taxes-if-you-work-in-iraq>Do you have to pay taxes if you work in Iraq?</h2>
<p>There a number of circumstances under which expats working in Iraq will be exempt from these taxes. If you are moving to Iraq having obtained a job with a government agency, or any organization that provides assistance to Iraq in its fight for regeneration, then you will not be liable to pay any tax.</p>
