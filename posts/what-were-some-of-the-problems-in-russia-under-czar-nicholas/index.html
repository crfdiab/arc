<h2 id=what-were-some-of-the-problems-in-russia-under-czar-nicholas>What were some of the problems in Russia under Czar Nicholas?</h2>
<p>Tsar Nicholas II was unable to rule effectively. He made poor decisions that led to worsening relations with the government and increased hardship for civilians and soldiers alike. Nicholas refused to accept any reduction in the absolute power he held.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-working-conditions-like-in-russia-with-czar-nicholas-ii-as-a-leader>What were working conditions like in Russia with Czar Nicholas II as a leader?</h2>
<p>What were working conditions in Russia like with Nicholas II as a leader? Not good. They weren’t good because they worked for days for 11 hours a day, six days a week, and they didn’t get a good pay.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-conditions-of-russia-by-1916>What were the conditions of Russia by 1916?</h2>
<p>There was acute shortage of bread and flour in cities. Riots at bread shops were common by the winter of 1916.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-society-of-russia-under-tsar-nicholas-ii>How was the Society of Russia under Tsar Nicholas II?</h2>
<p>Under Tsar Nicholas II (reigned 1894–1917), the Russian Empire slowly industrialized amidst increased discontent and dissent among the lower classes. This only increased during World War I, leading to the utter collapse of the Tsarist régime in 1917 and an era of civil war.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-poor-working-conditions-cause-the-russian-revolution>How did the poor working conditions cause the Russian revolution?</h2>
<p>Over three-quarters of the Russian population were unhappy with their position in the Empire. Peasants and workers alike suffered horrendous living and working conditions and hence posed a threat to the Tsarist regime. Discontent increased in the years before 1905 in the form of riots, illegal strikes and protests.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-condition-of-workers-under-tsar-in-russia>What was the condition of workers under Tsar in Russia?</h2>
<p>The Brainliest Answer! 1.the workers were in a divided social group. workers were divided under skill. 2.their occupations demanded more training and skill during Tsar’s rule. 3.divisions among workers showed themselves in dress and manners too.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-death-of-czar-nicholas-affect-the-russian-revolution>How did the death of Czar Nicholas affect the Russian Revolution?</h2>
<p>News that Nicholas had been assassinated almost completely overshadowed the political victories Lenin and his fellow revolutionaries had achieved, and pushed the Russian Revolution off the front page of newspapers. And, ironically, the deaths of Nicholas, Alexandra and their five children made many Russians yearn for the monarchy.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-bloody-sunday-on-tsarist-russia>What was the impact of Bloody Sunday on Tsarist Russia?</h2>
<p>The fallout from Bloody Sunday was huge. The people’s faith in their Tsar was finally shaken; “God Save the Tsar” gave way to angry cries of “The Tsar Will Not Help Us”. The number of terrorist attacks surged. In 1905, more than fifteen hundred government officials were assassinated.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-workers-under-the-bolsheviks>What was life like for workers under the Bolsheviks?</h2>
<p>The Conditions for Workers and Peasants Under the Bolsheviks and Under the Tsar’s Rule Conditions for workers and peasants were deplorable under the rule of the Tsars, but not to the extent they were under the Bolsheviks.</p>
