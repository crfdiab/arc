<p>287 million tonnes<br>
To find out how much humanity weighs, British researchers simply calculated the product of population size and average body mass. Their findings conclude that humanity weighs as much as 5,400 Titanics or 287 million tonnes.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-the-whole-entire-earth-weigh>How much does the whole entire earth weigh?</h2>
<p>Earth weighs about 13,170,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds (or 5,974,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms). Since Earth is too big to be placed on a scale, scientists use mathematics and the laws of gravity to figure out Earth’s weight.</p>

Earth/Mass</p>
<h2 id=what-has-the-most-mass-on-earth>What has the most mass on Earth?</h2>
<p>What is most of Earth’s mass? Earth’s core is 15 percent of the planet’s volume but 30 percent of its mass. Most of Earth’s mass is its mantle. The mantle is 84 percent of its volume and nearly 70 percent of its mass.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-earth-gaining-mass>Is the Earth gaining mass?</h2>
<p>Nasa has calculated that the Earth is gaining energy due to rising temperatures. Dr Smith and his colleague Mr Ansell estimate this added energy increases the mass of Earth by a tiny amount – 160 tonnes. This means that in total between 40,000 and 41,000 tonnes is being added to the mass of the planet each year.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-population-of-the-earth>How big is the population of the Earth?</h2>
<p>Humanity is getting more numerous and fatter while planet Earth itself is getting lighter. Planet Earth has a mass of 5.972 × 10^24 kg, something we’ve known since the 18th century. By one estimate, the total world population mass or ‘global biomass’ is of around 287 million tonnes. How much does the whole human population weigh?</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-the-average-person-on-earth-weigh>How much does the average person on Earth weigh?</h2>
<p>How much does everyone on Earth weigh if you add it all together? That’s the question a team of UK researchers have asked, and after many calculations, they have the answer. Researchers from the London School Of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine concluded yesterday that the total weight of the human adult population weighs in at 287 million tonnes.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-weight-does-the-worlds-population-carry>How much weight does the world’s population carry?</h2>
<p>Humanity could stand to lose a few pounds. If the entire human population stepped on a scale, the weight would be 316 million tons, or 632 billion pounds, a new study finds. The overweight people in the world carry a total of 16 million tons of extra weight — that’s the equivalent of 242 million normal-weight people.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-weight-of-the-earth-calculated>How is the weight of the earth calculated?</h2>
<p>Therefore, scientists use mathematics and the law of gravity to estimate the weight of Earth. This weight fluctuates depending on gases and dust escaping the atmosphere, as well as other activities in the solar system activities, such as meteors and comets hitting Earth. How Is the Weight of Earth Calculated?</p>
