<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-for-a-president-to-go-public-quizlet>What does it mean for a president to go public quizlet?</h2>
<p>“Going public” means reaching out the public as a tool to get the other branches to come to the table and to bargain. It is an important bargaining advantage the president has and should use to advance their policies.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-going-public-with-regard-to-the-presidency-quizlet>What is going public with regard to the presidency quizlet?</h2>
<p>Going public is a strategy used by presidents and other politicians to promote their policies by appealing to the public for support. If the president has a lot of support, then popularity creates an important bargaining advantage.</p>

<h2 id=how-can-a-president-change-public-policy-almost-immediately>How can a president change public policy almost immediately?</h2>
<p>Answer: By issuing an executive order. Explanation: While executive orders do give the president a great deal of power to shape public policy, the president does have to ensure that his orders don’t run afoul of federal law and constitutional issues.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-going-public-mean-quizlet>What does going public mean quizlet?</h2>
<p>Going Public. The practice often used by presidents of taking their policy agendas directly to the public rather than to Congress.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-president-persuade-congress>How does the President persuade Congress?</h2>
<p>The President, however, can influence and shape legislation by a threat of a veto. By threatening a veto, the President can persuade legislators to alter the content of the bill to be more acceptable to the President. Congress can override a veto by passing the act by a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-for-presidents-of-going-public-quizlet>What are the disadvantages for presidents of going public quizlet?</h2>
<p>Going public, in general, undermines the presidents ability to make deals and govern with members of congress, this can start to erode political capital and damage approval when done to frequently.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-presidential-powers-checked>How are presidential powers checked?</h2>
<p>The President in the executive branch can veto a law, but the legislative branch can override that veto with enough votes. The legislative branch has the power to approve Presidential nominations, control the budget, and can impeach the President and remove him or her from office.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-should-a-company-be-to-go-public>How big should a company be to go public?</h2>
<p>Make sure the market is there. Conventional wisdom tells startups to go public when revenue hits $100 million. But the benchmark shouldn’t have anything to do with revenue — it should be all about growth potential. “The time to go public could be at $50 million or $250 million,” says Solomon.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-you-own-stock-in-a-private-company-that-goes-public>What happens when you own stock in a private company that goes public?</h2>
<p>When a private company becomes public, holders of private stock may not be permitted to sell shares for a period of months. This lock-up rule is enforced at the discretion of the underwriters in a new offering. The restriction exists to prevent abnormal trading activity from occurring in a new stock.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-a-president-goes-to-the-public>What happens when a president goes to the public?</h2>
<p>When presidents go public, they attempt to influence the decisions, actions, and opinions of others through speechmaking and other public activities. Over time, presidents have gone public more frequently as public expectations, governing norms, and the technology available to reach diverse audiences have evolved.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-presidents-go-public-for-the-first-time>When did Presidents go public for the first time?</h2>
<p>Although some scholars of the rhetorical presidency show how presidents have used speeches to govern since the dawn of American democracy, the bulk of scholarship centers on the modern presidency, as both advances in communications technologies and changes in federal policymaking institutions spurred presidents to go public.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-target-audience-for-a-president>Who is the target audience for a president?</h2>
<p>The president’s target audience can be Congress, the public, news media, or bureaucracy. Presidents have had some success going public, although the ways in which presidents have been successful vary by strategy and target audience.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-going-public-a-phenomenon-of-the-modern-presidency>Is the going public a phenomenon of the modern presidency?</h2>
<p>The question of whether going public is a phenomenon of the modern presidency, or one that has permeated the presidency from its founding, is a central debate about the rhetorical presidency. Tulis ( 1987) agrees with the former perspective and conceives of presidential rhetoric in two phases, or constitutions.</p>
