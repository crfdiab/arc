<p>One of the main functions of the clan was to provide kinship with clan members in other villages. Traditionally, a person would not be allowed to marry someone within his or her own clan. The clan was the most important group to which a person belonged.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-clans-in-tribes>What are clans in tribes?</h2>
<p>A clan is a group of people united by actual or perceived kinship and descent. Even if lineage details are unknown, clan members may be organized around a founding member or apical ancestor. Clans, in indigenous societies, tend to be endogamous, meaning that their members can marry one another.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-native-american-chiefs-chosen>How are Native American chiefs chosen?</h2>
<p>All Chiefs, nowadays, are elected by the adult membership of their tribe. Usually, five to six members are elected to run all affairs of the tribe and the Chief serves as Chairman of the Board. He is the top executive who represents the tribe in all governmental affairs with federal agencies.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-clans-and-tribes-work>How do clans and tribes work?</h2>
<p>Tribes and Clans Within each tribe were smaller groups called clans. The members of a clan generally shared a common ancestor and were considered related to one another. Each clan had its own symbol or spirit that gave the clan its name. Many of the clan names were animals, but not all of them.</p>
<h2 id=are-chippewa-and-ojibwe-the-same-people>Are Chippewa and Ojibwe the same people?</h2>
<p>Ojibwa, also spelled Ojibwe or Ojibway, also called Chippewa, self-name Anishinaabe, Algonquian-speaking North American Indian tribe who lived in what are now Ontario and Manitoba, Can., and Minnesota and North Dakota, U.S., from Lake Huron westward onto the Plains.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-native-american-tribes-that-have-clans>Are there Native American tribes that have clans?</h2>
<p>Native American and First Nations peoples, often referred to as “tribes”, also have clans. For instance, Ojibwa bands are smaller parts of the Ojibwa people or tribe in North America. The many Native American peoples are distinguished by language and culture, and most have clans and bands as the basic kinship organizations.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-clans-organized-in-an-indigenous-society>How are Clans organized in an indigenous society?</h2>
<p>Even if lineage details are unknown, clan members may be organized around a founding member or apical ancestor. Clans, in indigenous societies, tend to be exogamous, meaning that their members cannot marry one another. Clans preceded more centralized forms of community organization and government, and exist in every country.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-clans-so-important-to-the-anishinaabe>Why are clans so important to the Anishinaabe?</h2>
<p>The Ojibwe word for clan ( doodem) was borrowed into English as totem. The clans, based mainly on animals, were instrumental in traditional occupations, intertribal relations, and marriages. Today, the clan remains an important part of Anishinaabe identity.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-ancestor-does-a-clan-have>What kind of ancestor does a clan have?</h2>
<p>The kinship-based bonds may also have a symbolic ancestor, whereby the clan shares a “stipulated” common ancestor that is a symbol of the clan’s unity. When this “ancestor” is non-human, it is referred to as a totem, which is frequently an animal.</p>
