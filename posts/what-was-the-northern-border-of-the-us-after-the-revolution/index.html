<h2 id=what-was-the-northern-border-of-the-us-after-the-revolution>What was the northern border of the US after the revolution?</h2>
<p>1818. The Treaty of 1818 established the 49th parallel north west of the Lake of the Woods as the border with British-held lands, and Oregon Country was established as a shared land between the United States and United Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-borders-for-the-united-states-after-the-war-for-independence>What were the borders for the United States after the war for independence?</h2>
<p>The Treaty of Paris granted the United States title to an extraordinarily vast expanse of land. The fledgling nation stretched from the sparsely settled Atlantic Coast in the east, to the Mississippi River in the west; from the Great Lakes in the north, to near the Gulf of Mexico in the south.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-united-states-expand-its-borders-after-the-revolution>How did the United States expand its borders after the revolution?</h2>
<p>By 1820, the United States already extended well beyond its original boundaries. Through the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and treaties with Spain and Britain, the nation’s borders moved west to the Rocky Mountains, north to the 49th parallel, and south to Florida and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=what-land-did-america-gain-after-the-revolutionary-war>What land did America gain after the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>In the Treaty of Paris, the British Crown formally recognized American independence and ceded most of its territory east of the Mississippi River to the United States, doubling the size of the new nation and paving the way for westward expansion.</p>
<h2 id=what-territory-did-the-us-get-in-1783>What territory did the US get in 1783?</h2>
<p>Original territory – Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris that ended the War for Indepdendence in 1783, the United States included all of the territory east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida and south of Canada (which was British territory). The border with Canada was disputed until after the War of 1812.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-america-want-to-expand-beyond-their-borders>Why did America want to expand beyond their borders?</h2>
<p>The primary reason the U.S. expanded its influence in foreign countries: Economic reasons – industrialization in the late 1800s increased the need to trade with other countries.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-events-ended-the-revolutionary-war>What two events ended the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>The Treaty of Paris of 1783, negotiated between the United States and Great Britain, ended the revolutionary war and recognized American independence.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-body-of-water-separated-from-the-ocean>Which is a body of water separated from the ocean?</h2>
<p>Barachois – a body of water separated from the ocean by a sandbar Bay – a body of water that has a barrier on 3 sides, but is smaller than a gulf (Example: The Bay of Bengal) Bayou – a marshy area of rivers or lakes Bight – a curved, or recessed, coastline</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-water-bodies-that-surround-greece>What are the names of the water bodies that surround Greece?</h2>
<p>This country is famous for its ancient Greek mythology where places such as Athens and Mount Olympus played significant roles. The water bodies that surround Greece are the Ionian Sea, the Aegean Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-water-from-a-river-come-from>Where does the water from a river come from?</h2>
<p>They usually move towards an ocean, lake, pond, or another river. A river’s water source can be melting snow, rain, or glaciers. Rivers normally contain freshwater and flow downhill from their source. Upstream, also called upriver, is the direction of the river’s water source.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-description-of-a-navigable-body-of-water>Which is the best description of a navigable body of water?</h2>
<p>Bodies of water that are navigable are known as waterways. Some bodies of water collect and move water, such as rivers and streams, and others primarily hold water, such as lakes and oceans. Estuary – a semi-enclosed coastal body of water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea.</p>
