<h2 id=what-did-marco-and-polo-discover>What did Marco and Polo discover?</h2>
<p>Marco Polo was among the first Europeans to describe many of the advanced technologies found in China. Among other things, Marco familiarized many of his readers with the concept of paper money, which only caught on in Europe in the years after his return.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-marco-polo-credited-with>What is Marco Polo credited with?</h2>
<p>The world-famous explorer Marco Polo is credited with many things, but perhaps the greatest is compiling one of the world’s first best-selling travelogues. Published around 1300, the book chronicles his experiences during a 24-year odyssey from Venice to Asia and back again.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-marco-polo-famous-for>What is Marco Polo famous for?</h2>
<p>Marco Polo, (born c. 1254, Venice [Italy]—died January 8, 1324, Venice), Venetian merchant and adventurer who traveled from Europe to Asia in 1271–95, remaining in China for 17 of those years, and whose Il milione (“The Million”), known in English as the Travels of Marco Polo, is a classic of travel literature.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-pasta-did-marco-polo-bring-to-china>What kind of pasta did Marco Polo bring to China?</h2>
<p>Before Marco Polo left for his China expedition in 1292, Italy had discovered the culinary delights of pasta centuries earlier. The Arab geographer Idrisi described the pasta he encountered in Sicily in 1154 as made from flour and formed into long strings [source: Needham and Wang ].</p>
<h2 id=where-did-marco-polo-describe-the-flavor-of-spices>Where did Marco Polo describe the flavor of spices?</h2>
<p>Marco Polo mentioned spices frequently in his travel memoirs (around AD 1298). He described the flavor of the sesame oil of Afghanistan and the plants of ginger and cassia of Kain-du (the city of Peking), where people drank a flavorful wine of rice and spices.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-marco-polo-discover-on-his-journey>What did Marco Polo discover on his journey?</h2>
<p>He traveled farther than any explorers before him, journeying for over 24 years on the Silk Road, documenting the foreign culture, technology and civilizations. The account of Marco Polo’s extensive journey through Asia was written by Rustichello of Pisa, who was a romance writer that Marco Polo met in jail.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-niccolo-and-maffeo-polo-meet-each-other>How did Niccolo and Maffeo Polo meet each other?</h2>
<p>Kublai quizzed them on European affairs and decided to send them on a goodwill mission to the pope. In 1269, the two brothers finally made it back to Venice, where Niccolò and Marco Polo met each other for the first time. Two years later, Niccolò and Maffeo sailed to Acre in present-day Israel, this time with Marco at their side.</p>
