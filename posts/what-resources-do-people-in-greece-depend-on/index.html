<h2 id=what-resources-do-people-in-greece-depend-on>What resources do people in Greece depend on?</h2>
<p>Resources and power Greece has few natural resources. Its only substantial mineral deposits are of nonferrous metals, notably bauxite. The country also has small deposits of silver ore and marble, which are mined.</p>
<h2 id=did-greece-depend-on-agriculture>Did Greece depend on agriculture?</h2>
<p>Agriculture was the foundation of the Ancient Greek economy. Nearly 80% of the population was involved in this activity.</p>
<h2 id=is-greece-good-for-farming>Is Greece good for farming?</h2>
<p>While agriculture is not a thriving economic sector, Greece is still a major EU producer of cotton and tobacco. Greece’s olives—many of which are turned into olive oil—are the country’s most renowned export crop. Grapes, melons, tomatoes, peaches, and oranges are also popular EU exports.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-farming-hard-in-greece>Why was farming hard in Greece?</h2>
<p>Farming in ancient Greece was difficult due to the limited amount of good soil and cropland. It is estimated that only twenty percent of the land was usable for growing crops. The main crops were barley, grapes, and olives. Grain crops, such as barley and wheat, were planted in October and harvested in April or May.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-environment-affect-the-ancient-greeks>How did the environment affect the ancient Greeks?</h2>
<p>The environment shaped the Greeks to become amazing soldiers, people, and raiders. The environment made an impact on the Greeks by teaching them how to collect food and survive in a harsh environment. Therefore, the Greeks had to adapt to their environment efficiently. The environment also affected them because they had to learn to fish instead …</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-priorities-for-greek-green-growth>What are the three priorities for Greek green growth?</h2>
<p>The three key priorities for Greek Green Growth are protecting biodiversity, climate & energy, conserving the country’s natural resources, as well as changing the patterns of production and consumption. Volunteer! For problems such as the environmental crisis, we become part of the problem if we don’t contribute in finding the solution.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-way-forward-for-greece>Which is the best way forward for Greece?</h2>
<p>Green Growth – which respects the environment and sees it as a source of growth, rather than a drain on development – is the only viable way forward for Greece.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-water-wheel-used-in-ancient-greece>How was the water wheel used in ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>A water wheel was used to make energy with a mill race (small water slide used to transport water) that dropped water into cups that weigh the water wheel and spun it downward. This in turn pushed gears to create energy.</p>
