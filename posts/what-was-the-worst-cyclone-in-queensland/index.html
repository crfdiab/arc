<h2 id=what-was-the-worst-cyclone-in-queensland>What was the worst cyclone in Queensland?</h2>
<p>Cyclone Mahina was the deadliest tropical cyclone in Australia’s recorded history, and probably one of the most intense ever recorded.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-cyclone-larry-in-queensland>When was cyclone Larry in Queensland?</h2>
<p>20 March 2006<br>
Severe Tropical Cyclone Larry crossed the tropical north Queensland coast near Innisfail during the morning of Monday 20 March 2006. Fortunately, no lives were lost and no serious injuries were reported.</p>
<h2 id=which-city-in-australia-has-the-most-thunderstorms>Which city in Australia has the most thunderstorms?</h2>
<p>Thunderstorms in Australia are most common near the northwest coast (where more than 40 occur each year), central Queensland (with over 50/a), and on small patches of the highest parts of the Dividing Range along the east coast. They are fewest over the arid interior, with less than 10/a (Fig 1).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-tropical-cyclone-hamish-start-and-end>When did Tropical Cyclone Hamish start and end?</h2>
<p>The low drifted to the southwest and intensified to become Tropical Cyclone Hamish on the March 5th. It continued in a south to southwest direction and intensified over the following 24 hours, before taking a south-south-easterly track parallel to the coast.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-a-cyclone-hit-brisbane>When was the last time a cyclone hit Brisbane?</h2>
<p>Lance had been declared a cyclone near Cairns a few days before but had weakened as it moved south in the Coral Sea. On April 8, a new low was sitting 200km north-north-east of Brisbane at a pressure of approximately a category one system cyclone, but it moved away to the east on the ninth and was not classified as a tropical cyclone.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-cyclone-nancy-hit-south-east-queensland>Where did Cyclone Nancy hit South East Queensland?</h2>
<p>Infographic: Cyclone Nancy made a slow and erratic path along the south east Queensland coast. (Supplied: Bureau of Meteorology ) Even though it never made landfall, 530mm of rain fell in 24 hours and 132mm fell in just three hours between the coast and coastal ranges south of Brisbane.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-cyclone-oswald-hit-on-the-queensland-coast>Where did Cyclone Oswald hit on the Queensland coast?</h2>
<p>Cyclone Oswald had an erratic path in the Gulf of Carpentaria before it proceeded down the Queensland coast. The ex-tropical cyclone caused serious damage on its way, including tornadoes and flooding in Bundaberg. The system passed well inland of Brisbane and eventually went back out to sea near Sydney.</p>
