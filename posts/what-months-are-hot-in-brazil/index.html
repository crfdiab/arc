<h2 id=what-months-are-hot-in-brazil>What months are hot in Brazil?</h2>
<p>The annual average temperature in the region is 22 to 26 °C (72 to 79 °F), with not much variation between the warmest and the coldest months. The hottest part of Brazil is the northeast, where temperatures of more than 38 °C (100 °F) are frequently recorded during the dry season between May and November.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-cheapest-time-to-travel-to-brazil>What is the cheapest time to travel to Brazil?</h2>
<p>February is currently the cheapest month to fly to Brazil. At this moment in time December is the most expensive month. These prices are determined by multiple factors and booking in advance can help keep costs down if your schedule is not as flexible.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-tickets-to-brazil-so-expensive>Why are tickets to Brazil so expensive?</h2>
<p>It’s because of corruption, ridiculously high taxes, and logistics bottlenecks that make Brazil what it is: one of the most costly countries to do business in. It surely is one of the most costly countries to fly to.</p>
<h2 id=when-to-visit-rio-de-janeiro>When to visit Rio de Janeiro?</h2>
<p>Best Times to Visit Rio de Janeiro. The best time to visit Rio is between December and March, when the weather is warm and sunny enough to hit the beaches.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-travel-to-brazil>When is the best time to travel to Brazil?</h2>
<p>A pleasant time to travel as the high temperatures of the last few months decline. The Pantanal enters its dry season towards the end of April. Semana Santa (Easter): During Semana Santa, the cobbled streets of Ouro Preto in Minas Gerais are covered in carpets of intricate patterns of flowers and other natural materials.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-visit-salvador>When is the best time to visit Salvador?</h2>
<p>December to March is the high season; amusements, music festivals or nightlife are at their high point. That’s the best time for those who want to share the exuberance, the joy and the musical side of Salvador and Bahia. Temperatures are high but it rains little, and humidity is not as high as in other months.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-visit-panama>When is the best time to visit Panama?</h2>
<p>Except for the month of November, any time of the year is great for visiting Panama, so planning a time to venture to this paradise will ultimately be up to you. Read on for our guide of Panama’s low, high, dry, and wet seasons. Most travelers visit Panama during its dry season—summer—which begins mid-December and ends in mid-April.</p>
