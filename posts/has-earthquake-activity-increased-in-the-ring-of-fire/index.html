<h2 id=has-earthquake-activity-increased-in-the-ring-of-fire>Has earthquake activity increased in the Ring of Fire?</h2>
<p>Reports of earthquakes and volcano eruptions in regions along the Ring of Fire might lead some to believe that the level of activity in recent months is above average. Not long after the eruption, a deadly magnitude-7.5 earthquake shook Papua New Guinea with what was considered its worst quake in a century.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-ring-of-fire-so-active>Why is the Ring of Fire so active?</h2>
<p>The Ring of Fire has long been an active site for earthquakes and volcanoes because of the active plate boundaries. The tectonic boundaries of the Ring of Fire are so active because they are mostly subduction zones. This means that one plate, the heavier of the two, slides under the other plate at the boundary.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-earthquakes-often-happen-around-the-ring-of-fire-apex>Why do earthquakes often happen around the Ring of Fire apex?</h2>
<p>Answer: The ring is the location of subduction zones.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-most-earthquakes-happen>Where do most earthquakes happen?</h2>
<p>Over 80 per cent of large earthquakes occur around the edges of the Pacific Ocean, an area known as the ‘Ring of Fire’; this where the Pacific plate is being subducted beneath the surrounding plates. The Ring of Fire is the most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-are-affected-by-the-ring-of-fire>What countries are affected by the Ring of Fire?</h2>
<p>The Pacific Ring of Fire stretches across 15 more countries including Indonesia, New Zealand, Papa New Guinea, Philippines, Japan, United States, Chile, Canada, Guatemala, Russia and Peru etc (fig. 3).</p>
<h2 id=are-there-earthquakes-in-the-ring-of-fire>Are there earthquakes in the ring of fire?</h2>
<p>Click below to visit our MapMaker Interactive map of tectonic activity in the Ring of Fire. This bookmark from our MapMaker Interactive map displays sites of major earthquakes, providing a beautiful illustration of the horseshoe-shaped Ring of Fire.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-plates-in-the-ring-of-fire-formed>How are the plates in the ring of fire formed?</h2>
<p>The Ring of Fire is formed by huge pieces of crust called tectonic plates. The plates are as large as continents. They are always moving. They move very slowly, though. Sometimes, plates crash into each other. When that happens, the edge, or boundary, is called convergent. The heavier plate can slip under the lighter plate.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-volcanoes-in-the-ring-of-fire>Why are there so many volcanoes in the ring of fire?</h2>
<p>Many volcanoes in the Ring of Fire were created through a process of subduction. And most of the planet’s subduction zones happen to be located in the Ring of Fire. What is subduction? Subduction happens when tectonic plates shift, and one plate is shoved under another.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-ring-of-fire-take-place>Where does the ring of fire take place?</h2>
<p>What is the “Ring of Fire”? Most earthquakes and volcanic eruptions do not strike randomly but occur in specific areas, such as along plate boundaries. One such area is the circum-Pacific Ring of Fire, where the Pacific Plate meets many surrounding tectonic plates. The Ring of Fire is the most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world.</p>
