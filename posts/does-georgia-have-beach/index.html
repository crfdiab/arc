<h2 id=does-georgia-have-beach>Does Georgia have beach?</h2>
<p>With just over 100 miles of coastline, Georgia has a mix of pristine white-sand beaches and lively shores just minutes from major cities, making them ideal for romantic long weekends or family summer vacations.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-islands-are-in-georgia>How many islands are in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Georgia’s Barrier Islands Georgia has 14 major barrier islands – four of which are found in the Golden Isles. St. Simons Island, Little St. Simons Island, Sea Island and Jekyll Island are some of Georgia’s most beautiful vacation destinations.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-beach-towns-in-georgia>Are there any beach towns in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Located in Chatham County, Georgia, Tybee Island is a city as well as an island in the easternmost end of the state and a popular tourist destination for visitors from Savannah as well as the rest of the world. Strategically placed near the mouth of Savannah River, Tybee Island was once frequented by pirates.</p>
<h2 id=is-st-simons-or-jekyll-better>Is St Simons or Jekyll better?</h2>
<p>The beaches on Jekyll are superior to St Simons. Now, St Simons has more to offer in the way of restaurants, shops, a village and a sense of a community, not just a resort area. East Beach is their best beach and is alot smaller than Jekyll.</p>
<h2 id=is-jekyll-island-pretty>Is Jekyll Island pretty?</h2>
<p>Jekyll Island has 10 miles of unspoiled and beautiful beaches. Jekyll Island is the southernmost island in Georgia’s beautiful Golden Isles. It is located just off the coast of Georgia. After those two beaches, there is not a big variety between the beaches, but they were all really pretty.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-beaches-in-georgia>What are the names of the beaches in Georgia?</h2>

<h2 id=how-many-islands-are-on-the-coast-of-georgia>How many islands are on the coast of Georgia?</h2>
<p>The coast of Georgia is roughly 110 miles and includes 15 barrier islands, four of which (Jekyll, St. Simons, Sea and Tybee) are accessible by car and have become popular resort destinations. The rest of Georgia’s islands require transportation by boat and are virtually unspoiled natural escapes.</p>
<h2 id=where-to-stay-on-the-beach-in-georgia>Where to stay on the beach in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Where to Stay. The historic The King and Prince Beach & Golf Resort has hotel rooms and condos right on the beach, as well as access to golf and tennis. Locals and visitors can be found in the pub at the boutique Village Inn and Pub near the Pier Village area downtown.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-beach-in-jekyll-island-georgia>Which is the best beach in Jekyll Island Georgia?</h2>
<p>You’ve likely seen photos of the iconic Driftwood Beach on the north side of the island with its contorted trees are strewn about the sand, which serves as a stunning silhouette against the sunset. A total of 10 miles of unique beaches envelope Jekyll.</p>
