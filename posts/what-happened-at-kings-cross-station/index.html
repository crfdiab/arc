<h2 id=why-was-kings-cross-station-built>Why was Kings Cross station built?</h2>
<p>King’s Cross Station was built as the London hub of the Great Northern Railway. The first temporary passenger station opened in 1850 in the Midland Goods Shed. Among the passengers was Queen Victoria who left for Scotland from here in 1851.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-to-build-kings-cross>How long did it take to build Kings Cross?</h2>
<p>After six years of design work, the plans were abandoned, and the international terminal was constructed at St Pancras. British Rail completed electrification of the East Coast Main Line to Leeds and Edinburgh between 1985 and 1991, and the current InterCity 225 rolling stock was introduced to work express services.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-smoking-banned-on-london-underground>When was smoking banned on London Underground?</h2>
<p>1987<br>
Tobacco and alcohol Smoking was allowed in certain carriages in trains until 9 July 1984. In the middle of 1987 smoking was banned for a six-month trial period in all parts of the Underground, and the ban was made permanent after the major King’s Cross fire in November 1987.</p>

<p>The now-decommissioned wooden escalator at Greenford (seen in 2006), similar to the one that caught fire at King’s Cross.

<h2 id=how-did-the-kings-cross-fire-get-under-control>How did the King’s Cross fire get under control?</h2>
<p>The heat from the fire was so intense that firefighters tackling the blaze had to use their hoses to spray the backs of colleagues in a bid to keep the temperature bearable for brief period. The fire was under control at 9:48pm and was out at 01:46am on 19 November. Search and salvage operations continued throughout the night.</p>
