<p>How did women’s roles change during the 1920s? Women responded, joining men in speakeasies, increasing sexuality (shorter skirts, higher divorce rates, drinking, smoking, etc). Also, single women could live alone in apartments in cities and work for a living for the first time.</p>
<h2 id=what-new-roles-for-women-became-available-in-the-1920s>What new roles for women became available in the 1920s?</h2>

Roles of 1920’s women in the workplace included factory workers, secretaries, salesclerks and telephone operators.</p>

<p>In the United States in the 1920s, only about 15 percent of white and 30 percent of black married women with wage-earning husbands held paying jobs.

<p>The Changing Roles of Women 1920-1940 – Home In the 1920s to 1940s, women started to more fully express their new gender norms. They expressed these new roles in varying ways. The right to vote helped to increase women’s presence in the public sphere when the 19th amendment passed.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-pregnancy-a-problem-in-the-1920s>Why was pregnancy a problem in the 1920s?</h2>
<p>Many employers considered pregnancy to be a detriment to job productivity, and fired women long before their due date. Some working women went to lengths of concealing their pregnancies, using the decade’s loose flapper fashions to hide their changing bodies.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-women-not-work-outside-the-home-in-the-1920s>Why did women not work outside the home in the 1920s?</h2>
