<h2 id=what-was-the-motivation-for-new-england>What was the motivation for New England?</h2>
<p>The New England colonies were founded to escape religious persecution in England. The Middle colonies, like Delaware, New York, and New Jersey, were founded as trade centers, while Pennsylvania was founded as a safe haven for Quakers.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-people-who-came-to-new-england-looking-for>What were the people who came to New England looking for?</h2>
<p>Although economic prosperity was still a goal of the New England settlers, their true goal was spiritual. Fed up with the ceremonial Church of England, Pilgrims and Puritans sought to recreate society in the manner they believed God truly intended it to be designed.</p>
<h2 id=what-made-new-england-so-attractive-to-colonization>What made New England so attractive to colonization?</h2>
<p>New England The climate was cold, which made the ground hard and more difficult to farm. While Southern colonists disdained the land in New England because it could not provide them with a profitable crop to send to England, many English Puritans were immediately attracted to it.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-culture-of-the-new-england-region>What was the culture of the New England region?</h2>

<p>For the English in the New World there are really three labor options. One is to transport people from England to the New World. Another is to employ or exploit the indigenous labor… And the third is to bring people from Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-farmers-bring-to-the-new-england-colonies>What did the farmers bring to the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>As a group, the farmers brought a high degree of mechanical ingenuity and self-sufficiency. Fishing: Boston began exporting fish in 1633. In 1639, Massachusetts Bay was exempted from paying taxes on fishing boats; and as a result, by 1700, the fishing industry was huge.</p>
