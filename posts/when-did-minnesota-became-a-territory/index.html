<p>1849<br>
In 1849, Minnesota became a U.S. territory.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-governor-of-the-minnesota-territory>Who was the first governor of the Minnesota territory?</h2>
<p>Henry H. Sibley was elected the first governor in a statewide election held on October 13, 1857 and took office following Minnesota’s entry into the Union as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858. At the time, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected on separate ballots to terms lasting two years.</p>

<p>Minnesota Territory Centennial, issue of 1949. The Territory of Minnesota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 3, 1849, until May 11, 1858, when the eastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Minnesota.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-territory-of-the-minnesota-territory>What was the territory of the Minnesota Territory?</h2>
<p>Parts of northern Minnesota were considered to be in Rupert’s Land, a large territory owned by Hudson’s Bay Company. The exact definition of the boundary between Minnesota and British North America was not addressed until the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-land-sold-in-minnesota>When was the first land sold in Minnesota?</h2>
<p>In 1848, the first land in what would become the State of Minnesota was opened for entry; in 1930, the public domain was declared closed within the state. The GLO records are the basis of all land titles in the State and are valuable for a wide range of geographical, historical, genealogical, and land law research.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-state-of-minnesota-located-on-the-map>Where is the state of Minnesota located on the map?</h2>
<p>Minnesota is one of the north-central states. It is bounded by the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Ontario to the north, by Lake Superior and the state of Wisconsin to the east, and by the states of Iowa to the south and South Dakota and North Dakota to the west.
