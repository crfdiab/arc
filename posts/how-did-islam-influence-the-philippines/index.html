<h2 id=how-did-islam-influence-the-philippines>How did Islam influence the Philippines?</h2>
<p>In 1380 Karim Al Makhdum the first Arabian trader reached the Sulu Archipelago and Jolo in the Philippines and established Islam in the country through trade in several regions of the island. In 1390 the Minangkabau’s Prince Rajah Baguinda and his followers preached Islam on the islands.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spaniards-influence-the-filipino-way-of-life>How did the Spaniards influence the Filipino way of life?</h2>
<p>Spain not only brought the Catholic religion to the Philippine islands, it also brought with it its culture and cuisine. When the Spaniards arrived, they brought with them ingredients and labor-intensive cooking methods that were unknown in the Philippines.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-important-influence-of-islam>What was the most important influence of Islam?</h2>
<p>In summary, the coming of Islam to Sub-Saharan Africa facilitated the rise of political empires, encouraged trade and wealth, and increased the traffic in slavery. In its pure form, Islam was more attractive to kings because of its concept of the caliph combined political power with religious authority.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-islam-influence-the-culture-of-the-philippines>How did Islam influence the culture of the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Islamic religion, the spices in meals and the use of silk in clothing to name a few, have been significant markers to the development of the Filipino Culture.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-islam-in-the-philippines>Who was the leader of Islam in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>The strength of the Sulu sultanate in the early 14th was enhanced by Malay leaders who helped the natives in political, economic, and religious developments. Among others, Rajah Baguinda, a Sumatrans prince, came to the Philippines in 1390 with a group of men, all learned in Islam.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-moslems-in-the-philippines>Why are there so many Moslems in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Since it appears that everyone would like these Moslems to consider themselves Filipinos, it is un­ derstandable why there is a demand that they adopt, as their own history as Filipinos, the above mentioned significant events.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-islam-on-science>What was the impact of Islam on science?</h2>
<p>During the Golden Age of Islam, major intellectual discoveries and advancements were made in philosophy, language, math, science, astronomy and medicine. The effects of this Islamic intellectual activity remains today. Sciencing_Icons_Science</p>
