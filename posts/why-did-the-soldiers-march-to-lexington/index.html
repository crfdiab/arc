<h2 id=why-did-the-soldiers-march-to-lexington>Why did the soldiers march to Lexington?</h2>
<p>The Battles of Lexington and Concord, fought on April 19, 1775, kicked off the American Revolutionary War (1775-83). On the night of April 18, 1775, hundreds of British troops marched from Boston to nearby Concord in order to seize an arms cache.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-battle-of-lexington-happen>Why did the Battle of Lexington happen?</h2>
<p>The British marched into Lexington and Concord intending to suppress the possibility of rebellion by seizing weapons from the colonists. Instead, their actions sparked the first battle of the Revolutionary War.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-the-minutemen-from-lexington-gathered-at-lexington-green>Why were the minutemen from Lexington gathered at Lexington Green?</h2>
<p>Selected members of the militia were called minutemen because they could be ready to fight in a minute’s time. Sure enough, when the advance guard of nearly 240 British soldiers arrived in Lexington, they found about 70 minutemen formed on the Lexington Green awaiting them.</p>

<p>O n the evening of April 18, 1775 a contingent of British soldiers was ferried from Boston to the opposite shore. Their orders were to proceed to the villages of Lexington and Concord and arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock who were inciting revolutionary unrest among the colonists.</p>

<p>This eyewitness account appears in: Charles-Edwards and B. Richardson They Saw it Happen, An Anthology of Eyewitness Accounts of Events in British History 1689-1897 (1958). “Battle at Lexington Green, 1775: The British Perspective,” EyeWitness to History, <a href=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com>www.eyewitnesstohistory.com</a> (2010).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-british-respond-to-the-battle-of-concord>How did the British respond to the Battle of Concord?</h2>
<p>While at Concord we saw vast numbers assembling in many parts; at one of the bridges they marched down, with a very considerable body, on the light infantry posted there. On their coming pretty near, one of our men fired on them, which they returned; on which an action ensued, and some few were killed and wounded.</p>
