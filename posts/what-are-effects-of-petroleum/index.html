<h2 id=what-are-effects-of-petroleum>What are effects of petroleum?</h2>
<p>Oil is a cleaner fuel than coal, but it still has many disadvantages, such as the following: Refining petroleum creates air pollution. Transforming crude oil into petrochemicals releases toxins into the atmosphere that are dangerous for human and ecosystem health. Burning gasoline releases CO2.</p>
<h2 id=is-petroleum-safe-for-the-environment>Is Petroleum safe for the environment?</h2>
<p>Although petroleum products make life easier, finding, producing, and moving crude oil may have negative effects on the environment. Technological advances in exploration, production, and transportation of oil and enforcement of safety and environmental laws and regulations help to avoid and reduce these effects.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-petroleum-affect-human-health>How does petroleum affect human health?</h2>
<p>Adverse health effects can include skin irritation, eye irritation, dizziness, headache, nausea and, and in extreme cases, death (2). Because petroleum is widely used, unintentional acute releases can occur almost anywhere.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-burning-of-petroleum-affect-the-environment>How does the burning of petroleum affect the environment?</h2>
<p>When petroleum products such as gasoline are burned for energy, they release toxic gases and high amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Carbon helps regulate the Earth’s atmospheric temperature, and adding to the natural balance by burning fossil fuels adversely affects our climate.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-health-effects-of-exposure-to-petroleum-products>What are the health effects of exposure to petroleum products?</h2>
<p>Animals exposed to high levels of some petroleum products have developed liver and kidney tumors. A spill that affects a home or business may affect the health of people who live and work there.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-petroleum-industry-good-for-the-environment>How is the petroleum industry good for the environment?</h2>
<p>Most alternative technologies for energy generation, transportation, and storage can only be realized at this time because of its diverse usefulness. Conservation, efficiency, and minimizing waste impacts of petroleum products are effective industry and consumer actions toward achieving better environmental sustainability.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-petroleum-get-to-the-surface-of-the-earth>How does petroleum get to the surface of the Earth?</h2>
<p>The petroleum then collects in reservoirs, which can be several hundred meters below the surface of the Earth. Petroleum can be contained by structural traps, which are formed when massive layers of rock are bent or faulted (broken) from the Earth’s shifting landmasses. Oil can also be contained by stratigraphic traps.</p>
