<h2 id=how-did-the-american-depression-affect-the-rest-of-the-world>How did the American depression affect the rest of the world?</h2>
<p>Great Depression, worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 and lasted until about 1939. Although it originated in the United States, the Great Depression caused drastic declines in output, severe unemployment, and acute deflation in almost every country of the world.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-depression-affect-south-america>How did the Great Depression affect South America?</h2>
<p>The Great Depression which followed the US stock market crash of 1929 badly affected the countries of Latin America. Brazil was hit hard by the great depression. Between 1929 and 1932, coffee exports fell 50%. Foreign investment in the country was reduced to zero.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-great-depression-end>When did the Great Depression end?</h2>
<p>August 1929 – March 1933<br>
The Great Depression/Time period</p>
<h2 id=how-was-china-affected-by-the-great-depression>How was China affected by the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>The rural economy was hit hard by the Great Depression of the 1930s, in which an overproduction of agricultural goods lead to massive falling prices for China as well as an increase in foreign imports (as agricultural goods produced in western countries were “dumped” in China).</p>
<h2 id=what-did-hoover-do-during-the-great-depression>What did Hoover do during the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>A member of the Republican Party, he held office during the onset of the Great Depression. Before serving as president, Hoover led the Commission for Relief in Belgium, served as the director of the U.S. Food Administration, and served as the third U.S. secretary of commerce.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-africa-affected-by-the-great-depression>How was Africa affected by the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>The Great Depression had a pronounced economic and political effect on South Africa, as it did on most nations at the time. As world trade slumped, demand for South African agricultural and mineral exports fell drastically. Growing gold exports compensated somewhat for the loss of other trade revenue.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-religious-tolerance-so-important-in-america>Why was religious tolerance so important in America?</h2>
<p>Ever since these religious dissidents arrived at their shining “city upon a hill,” as their governor John Winthrop called it, millions from around the world have done the same, coming to an America where they found a welcome melting pot in which everyone was free to practice his or her own faith.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-history-of-tolerance-for-violence>Is there a history of tolerance for violence?</h2>
<p>In some ways, these statistics outline a contemporary problem—but the challenges they describe are legacies of systems much older and deeper.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-definition-of-the-word-tolerance>Which is the best definition of the word tolerance?</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with some abbreviated Wikipedia definitions: Tolerance is a fair, objective, and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions, practices, race, religion, nationality, etc., differ from one’s own; freedom from bigotry.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-older-americans-concerned-about-their-data>How are older Americans concerned about their data?</h2>
<p>Americans ages 50 and older were particularly likely to express concerns over the safety of their data: 58% of these older Americans said their data were less secure than five years prior.</p>
