<h2 id=why-are-dreams-important-to-aboriginal-culture>Why are dreams important to Aboriginal culture?</h2>
<p>Dreaming gives identity It gives them identity, dictates how they express their spirituality (see below) and tells them which other Aboriginal people are related to them in a close family, because those share the same Dreaming.</p>
<h2 id=why-dreamtime-stories-are-so-significant-to-indigenous-culture-and-heritage>Why Dreamtime stories are so significant to indigenous culture and heritage?</h2>
<p>Aboriginal art is closely linked to religious ceremonies or rituals. Dreamtime stories of creations are handed down through storytelling, paintings, song and dance, so this makes it easy for even the very young to learn and pass down. This tradition continues and is imperative to keep the culture alive.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-does-dreamtime-stories-have-on-aboriginal-culture-and-australian-culture>What impact does Dreamtime stories have on Aboriginal culture and Australian culture?</h2>
<p>Different Aboriginal groups have different dreamtime stories, but all teach about aspects that affect daily life. Dreamtime stories teach Aboriginal people about the importance of sharing with and caring for people of their community, of nurturing the land and of the significance of the land and its creatures.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-land-so-important-to-the-aboriginal-peoples>Why is land so important to the Aboriginal peoples?</h2>
<p>Land of the ancestors. Aboriginal people are born into the responsibility to care for their land, today and with future generations. Land sustains Aboriginal lives in every aspect, spiritually, physically, socially and culturally. The connection to land gives Aboriginal people their identity and a sense of belonging.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-famous-dreamtime-story>What is the most famous dreamtime story?</h2>
<p>The Rainbow Serpent is one of the most famous Aboriginal creation stories.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-aboriginal-people-tell-their-stories>How do Aboriginal people tell their stories?</h2>
<p>Down through generations, the Aboriginal people’s stories, were told orally, but were never written down. They were the oral textbooks, of their accumulated knowledge, spirituality, and wisdom, from when time began. The structure and form of a traditional Dreamtime story is quite unique and cannot easily be copied.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-dreaming-stories-important-to-aboriginal-people>Why are dreaming stories important to Aboriginal people?</h2>
<p>The fact that for Aboriginal communities the telling and learning of the Dreaming stories is a life long process is a reflection of its centrality to Aboriginal spirituality.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-dreaming-in-australia>What was the history of Dreaming in Australia?</h2>
<p>Estimates date this history between 50,000 and 65,000 years. Before European settlement of Australia, there were around 600 different Aboriginal nations, based on language groups. The Dreaming represents all that is known and understood by Aboriginal societies it determines all relationships and responsibilities between Aboriginal people.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-dreaming-a-mythology-for-indigenous-australians>Is the Dreaming a mythology for Indigenous Australians?</h2>
<p>The Dreaming is not mythology in this sense of not being true and it isn’t about dreams-for many Indigenous Australians it is the truth about the meaning of everything.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-land-so-important-to-aboriginal-people>Why is land so important to Aboriginal people?</h2>
<p>The Dreaming explains why land is critical to the expression of Aboriginal spirituality, as it is through the land that the Dreaming is activated. In other words, the land is where the dreaming and its stories take place, and is the resting place for the ancestral spirit beings, and hence is like a mother for the people.</p>
