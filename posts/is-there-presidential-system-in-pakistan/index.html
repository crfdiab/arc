<h2 id=which-is-the-best-system-of-government-in-pakistan>Which is the best system of government in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>The presidential system holds firmly even when a cavalier, myopic individual is on the seat, and effectively contains and protects the country and its people from harm. Changing its model of government to the presidential system is the best way to ensure a democracy that works in Pakistan.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-pakistan-first-adopt-a-parliamentary-form-of-government>When did Pakistan first adopt a parliamentary form of government?</h2>
