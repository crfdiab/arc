<h2 id=why-are-some-houses-built-with-thick-walls-and-flat-roofs>Why are some houses built with thick walls and flat roofs?</h2>
<p>Some houses are built with thick walls and flat roofs because to keep the house cool. The thick walls prevent the heat from entering into the houses while the flat roofs help to retain the little water that has been collected during rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-houses-in-desert>What kind of houses in desert?</h2>
<p>In deserts, most of the houses are Kutcha houses as Kutcha houses are cooler as compared to Pucca Houses. Secondly, deserts have less rainfall so there is less chance of falling of these houses. Thus, due to climate and materials available there, Kutcha houses are common there.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-strongest-material>What is the strongest material?</h2>
<p>Graphene. Topping the list, graphene is the strongest materials known to humans. The transparent material is composed of a single layer carbon atom arranged in a triangular lattice and it’s the basic structural element in charcoal, graphite and carbon nanotubes.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-walls-of-a-desert-house>What makes the walls of a desert house?</h2>
<p>The thick walls are made of adobe blocks — a mixture of clay, sand, straw and water — which were originally dried in the hot summer sun. The heavy walls provide a thermal mass that slowly absorbs heat during the day and radiates it at night. In winter, corner fireplaces release heat into the rooms.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-up-the-roof-of-a-desert-hut>What makes up the roof of a desert hut?</h2>
<p>Traditional huts, do have a layer of cow-dung on its walls, specifically for heat regulation and insect repelling. The roof is made up of ‘ Kheep ‘, the hard desert grass. And given a cone shape or are inclined to prevent water from entering inside.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-modern-architecture-used-in-the-desert>How is modern architecture used in the desert?</h2>
<p>Focused on a central research building, with angular prows that jut out across the landscaping, the architecture combines structural boldness with complex patterns on the walls and ceilings, giving the long Islamic tradition of geometric form a literal twist. Photography: Hufton+Crow. Writer: Jonathan Bell</p>
<h2 id=why-are-all-the-walls-around-phoenix-homes>Why are all the walls around Phoenix homes?</h2>
<p>A friend visited and asked why all of our homes have block fences. I grew up here in the 1950s and ’60s and there were fences, not a lot, and not the block-type fences surrounding houses today. In other areas — Idaho and Colorado — where I have lived, there have been some fences, mostly wood. Not the privacy fences we have here.</p>
