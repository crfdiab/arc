<h2 id=what-document-created-a-strong-national-government>What document created a strong national government?</h2>
<p>The Articles of Confederation<br>
The Articles of Confederation served as the written document that established the functions of the national government of the United States after it declared independence from Great Britain.</p>
<h2 id=what-document-is-our-national-government-based-on>What document is our national government based on?</h2>
<p>Constitution. The Constitution defines the framework of the Federal Government of the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-document-outlines-the-power-of-the-national-government>What document outlines the power of the national government?</h2>
<p>The U.S. Constitution<br>
The U.S. Constitution, written in 1787 and ratified in 1788, outlines the structure of America’s federal government.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-it-strengthen-the-national-government>How did it strengthen the national government?</h2>
<p>The Constitution strengthened the national government by giving the national government specific powers. The Constitution also created the executive and judicial branches of government. The president would serve as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and he would have veto power over laws passed by Congress.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-separate-branches-of-government>What are the 3 separate branches of government?</h2>
<p>To ensure a separation of powers, the U.S. Federal Government is made up of three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. To ensure the government is effective and citizens’ rights are protected, each branch has its own powers and responsibilities, including working with the other branches.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-powers-of-the-national-government>What are two powers of the national government?</h2>
<p>Delegated (sometimes called enumerated or expressed) powers are specifically granted to the federal government in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. This includes the power to coin money, to regulate commerce, to declare war, to raise and maintain armed forces, and to establish a Post Office.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-national-government-necessary-in-the-united-states>Why was the national government necessary in the United States?</h2>
<p>The national government could make treaties and declare war, but it could not raise taxes or require the states to provide the funds that it requested. Nor could it stop the states from imposing taxes on each other’s exports. The weak national government was in no position to prevent the American economy from sinking into depression.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-articles-of-confederation-strengthen-the-states>How did the Articles of Confederation strengthen the States?</h2>
<p>But it didn’t have an executive official or judicial branch. The Articles Congress only had one chamber and each state had one vote. This strengthened the power of the states to act independently from the central government, even when that wasn’t in the nation’s best concerns.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-a-strong-central-government-so-important>Why was a strong central government so important?</h2>
<p>To national leaders, including Washington, the need for a stronger central government grew increasingly evident. Yet Americans had only recently rebelled against a tyrannical government, and remained suspicious of a concentration of government power. This was the dilemma facing the delegates who gathered in Philadelphia.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-primary-government-after-the-declaration-of-independence>What was the primary government after the declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>However, when the states came together to finish the first constitution, the nation was established as a confederation, where states were sovereign while trying to work together. The primary government of the United States following the Declaration of Independence was the Articles of Confederation.</p>
