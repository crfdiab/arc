<h2 id=what-are-examples-of-nonrenewable-vs-renewable-resources>What are examples of nonrenewable vs renewable resources?</h2>
<p>Fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, and coal are examples of nonrenewable resources. Humans constantly draw on the reserves of these substances while the formation of new supplies takes eons. Renewable resources are the opposite: Their supply replenishes naturally or can be sustained.</p>
<h2 id=which-are-the-2-types-of-non-renewable-resources-give-one-example-of-each>Which are the 2 types of non-renewable resources give one example of each?</h2>
<p>The two broad categories of non-renewable resources are fossil fuels and nuclear energy (from uranium ore).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are formed due to the continuous heating and compressing of organic matter buried beneath the earth’s surface.</p>

<h2 id=nuclear-energy-uranium-which-is-an-example-of-a-non-renewable-energy-source>Nuclear energy (Uranium) Which is an example of a non-renewable energy source?</h2>
<p>Historically, we have relied mostly on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas for energy. However, this is a non-renewable energy source, which means it will eventually run out. Renewable energy is power that is generated from natural resources that are constantly replenished.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-nonrenewable-energy-sources>What are the pros and cons of nonrenewable energy sources?</h2>
<p>In this article, we will look at the pros and cons of nonrenewable energy sources, which are one of the two forms of energy sources. Energy sources can either be renewable or nonrenewable with the main difference between them being consumption of fuel and combustion.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-coal-considered-a-non-renewable-resource>Why is coal considered a non renewable resource?</h2>
<p>Coal is considered as non-renewable resource because we can’t replicate the environment (Very high temperature and pressure) in which it was initially formed. Plus, it takes millions of years for it to be produced in the first place!</p>
<h2 id=why-is-uranium-considered-a-non-renewable-resource>Why is uranium considered a non renewable resource?</h2>
<p>It is a non-renewable resource because of its cosmic origin. The isotopes of uranium were formed 6.6 billion years ago in supernovas and do not naturally regenerate. In fact, the radioactive decay of the natural deposits of uranium is what keeps the earth’s core in a liquid form [13].</p>
