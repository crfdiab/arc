<h2 id=how-many-lines-is-150-words>How many lines is 150 words?</h2>
<p>If you need proof, have a look at any of your essays and count how many words per line you write. The requirement for an essay is at least 250 words, which equals 28 lines and you should count the lines, not the words. Any letter or report should be at least 150 words long, that’s 17 lines.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-500-words-look-like-on-a4>What does 500 words look like on A4?</h2>
<p>When it comes to comparing pages with word count, 500 words is an important number to remember. Using single spacing, 500 words is the same as 1 page. With double spacing, it’s around 2 pages. In both cases you’ll be using margins of a standard 1 inch and a font such as Times New Roman or Arial in 12pt size.</p>

<h2 id=whats-the-average-number-of-lines-in-a-page>What’s the average number of lines in a page?</h2>
<p>Here’s the issue: The old 120 page average has become the 120 page maximum. The average now looking like 110 pages, some sources even saying 100 pages isn’t too short.
