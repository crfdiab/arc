<p>The average cost of a tubal ligation reversal in the United States is $8,685. However, depending on factors such as where you live and what tests you need beforehand, the costs range from $5,000 to $21,000. Insurance doesn’t usually cover the cost of the surgery, but your doctor’s office may offer a payment plan.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-untie-your-tubes-if-you-get-them-tied>Can you untie your tubes if you get them tied?</h2>
<p>Your doctor may suggest an operation called “tubal ligation reversal.” A surgeon will reopen, untie, or reconnect your fallopian tubes so you can have a baby again.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-requirements-to-get-your-tubes-tied-in-kansas>What are the requirements to get your tubes tied in Kansas?</h2>
<p>In most cases, your doctor will want you to be 25-years old or older and have at least two children of your own before she will be willing to perform the surgery on you.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-requirements-for-a-woman-to-get-her-tubes-tied>What are the requirements for a woman to get her tubes tied?</h2>
<p>In order to be eligible to have this permanent birth control method for women performed in the USA you must between 18 and 21 years of age, with the specific age being dependent on your State. In Canada, the minimum age of consent for tubal ligation is 18 in every Province.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-get-pregnant-with-my-tubes-tied-cut-and-burned>Can I get pregnant with my tubes tied cut and burned?</h2>
<p>It is still possible to become pregnant after undergoing the procedure, but tubal ligation is usually highly effective. The surgery involves cutting and tying off the fallopian tubes to prevent an egg from entering the uterus. Undergoing tubal ligation increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-get-pregnant-with-your-tubes-tied>What happens if you get pregnant with your tubes tied?</h2>
<p>Women who become pregnant after undergoing tubal ligation have an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy can initially cause the same symptoms as a regular pregnancy. However, some additional symptoms may develop, including: light or heavy vaginal bleeding.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-you-bleed-after-tubal-ligation>How long do you bleed after tubal ligation?</h2>
<p>Vaginal bleeding up to one month after surgery is normal. Many women do not have their next normal menstrual cycle for four to six weeks after surgery. When your normal cycle returns, you may notice heavier bleeding and more discomfort than usual for the first two to three cycles.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-gain-weight-after-getting-your-tubes-tied>Do you gain weight after getting your tubes tied?</h2>
<p>It doesn’t affect your hormones. It won’t change your periods or bring on menopause. And it doesn’t cause the side effects that birth control pills do, like mood swings, weight gain, or headaches, or the ones sometimes caused by IUDs, like cramps, heavier periods, or spotting.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-unty-a-tubal-ligation>How much does it cost to Unty a tubal ligation?</h2>
<p>What is the Cost of Untying Tubes? Reverse tubal ligation is usually described as extremely expensive, ranging from $10,000 to $30,000. The tubal anastomosis procedure to untie tubes costs $5900 at A Personal Choice Center.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-your-tubes-untied>How much does it cost to get your tubes untied?</h2>
<p>Many couples do have the resources on hand to pay the entire fee upfront as requested by the surgical clinic. Therefore, they must borrow the money, which adds extra expenses. Upfront origination fees average 5% of the amount financed. For example, a patient borrowing $10,000 will have only $9,500 of funding to forward to the clinic.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-way-to-watch-the-untying-of-the-tubes>Is there a way to watch the untying of the tubes?</h2>
<p>To watch the entire operation, you can order a free video or DVD of tubes untied. Tubal implantation and salpingostomy are less frequent techniques to untie the tubes after a tubal ligation.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-a-tubal-anastomosis-procedure-cost>How much does a tubal anastomosis procedure cost?</h2>
<p>The tubal anastomosis procedure to untie tubes costs $5900 at A Personal Choice Center. Because it is done as outpatient surgery and performed four times a day, the cost savings is passed on to the women who want kids after tubal ligation.</p>
