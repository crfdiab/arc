<h2 id=how-can-humans-solve-environmental-problems>How can humans solve environmental problems?</h2>
<p>Recycle (& then recycle properly) Implementing recycling habits into your daily life is one of the most effective ways to help lessen landfill waste, conserve natural resources, save habitats, reduce pollution, cut down on energy consumption, and slow down global warming.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-difficult-to-solve-environmental-problems>Why is it difficult to solve environmental problems?</h2>
<p>‘ Tackling environmental problems today is more difficult because the nature of the “problems” has changed: where such problems were once primarily scientific and technocratic in nature, they are now almost exclusively problems of politics.</p>
<h2 id=what-environmental-problems-should-be-prioritized-by-humankind>What environmental problems should be prioritized by humankind?</h2>
<p>A SUSTAINABLE FOOD MODEL. Intensive food production harms the environment by depleting the soil and damaging marine ecosystems.</p>

<h2 id=overpopulation-and-waste-management-how-is-the-worlds-biggest-environmental-problem-being-solved>OVERPOPULATION AND WASTE MANAGEMENT. How is the world’s biggest environmental problem being solved?</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization recently estimated that one in nine deaths in 2012 were attributable to diseases caused by carcinogens and other poisons in polluted air. Solutions: Replace fossil fuels with renewable energy. Reforestation. Reduce emissions from agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-for-individuals-to-solve-global-problems>Is it possible for individuals to solve global problems?</h2>
<p>If we take civil and human rights seriously, we cannot assign solving global problems to the individual. And the call for greater individual responsibility actually risks becoming detrimental to the cause as it prevents people from realising the scale of political change that needs to happen.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-that-man-cannot-solve-his-problems>Is it true that man cannot solve his problems?</h2>
<p>Yes, why? Men have created many amazing technological inventions, but they cannot create solutions to their problems. Mankind has harnessed the power of computers to help process vast amounts of information, but human beings cannot correctly process their personal problems.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-so-many-people-unable-to-solve-their-problems>Why are so many people unable to solve their problems?</h2>
<p>As with the world in general, the passing of time finds individuals and families drowning under an ever-worsening sea of decadence and seemingly insurmountable difficulties. More and more seem completely incapable of managing their lives. Yes, why?</p>
