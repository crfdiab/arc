<table><tr><th>William Tyndale</th></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>6 October 1536 (aged 42) near Vilvoorde, Duchy of Brabant, Habsburg Netherlands in the Holy Roman Empire</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>English</td></tr><tr><td>Alma mater</td><td>Magdalen Hall, Oxford University of Cambridge</td></tr><tr><td>Known for</td><td>Tyndale Bible</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-european-christianity>What is European Christianity?</h2>
<p>Christianity is the largest religion in Europe. The second-largest Christian group in Europe were the Orthodox, who made up 32% of European Christians. About 19% of European Christians were part of the Protestant tradition.</p>
<h2 id=which-bible-translation-is-best>Which Bible translation is best?</h2>
<p>The New Revised Standard Version is the version most commonly preferred by biblical scholars. In the United States, 55% of survey respondents who read the Bible reported using the King James Version in 2014, followed by 19% for the New International Version, with other versions used by fewer than 10%.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-responsible-for-colonialism>Who is responsible for colonialism?</h2>
<p>Modern colonialism started with the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator (1394-1460), initiating the Age of Exploration and establishing African trading posts (1445 onwards).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-motivation-behind-the-new-imperialism>What was the motivation behind the new imperialism?</h2>
<p>One political motive for imperialism was the desire to gain national prestige. The actions of colonial governors also led to the acquisition of new colonial possessions. Colonial agents often sent troops to take over neighboring territories first and informed their home governments afterward.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-europeans-come-to-the-new-world>Why did the Europeans come to the New World?</h2>
<p>Few people in the 1400s had traveled far from Europe. Then, in 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed to North America. Other explorers followed. They used special navigation tools to help them cross the ocean. They brought back things of value.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-spanish-want-to-colonize-the-new-world>Why did the Spanish want to colonize the New World?</h2>
<p>This colonization would drive out the natives and create conflict between the European powers. While the Spanish, French, Portuguese, Dutch, and English were the main players in European colonization of the New World, they were not the only ones.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-christopher-columbus-go-to-the-new-world>Why did Christopher Columbus go to the New World?</h2>
<p>Enter Christopher Columbus, who thought he had found just that. Once Europe finally realized Columbus had tripped upon a ‘New World,’ or as the Europeans soon came to call it, the Mundus Novus, the desire for spices was joined by the desire for gold. In all fairness to Columbus, he wasn’t the only guy with his sights set on riches.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-colonization-of-the-new-world>Who was involved in the colonization of the New World?</h2>
<p>This colonization would drive out the natives and create conflict between the European powers. While the Spanish, French, Portuguese, Dutch, and English were the main players in European colonization of the New World, they were not the only ones. Sweden, Courland, Norway, The Danes, Russia, and Scotland also colonized the New World.</p>
