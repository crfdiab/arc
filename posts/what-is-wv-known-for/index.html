<h2 id=what-is-wv-known-for>What is WV known for?</h2>
<p>West Virginia is known for its scenic mountain beauty, unmatched outdoor recreation opportunities and the friendliest folks in the country. West Virginia is the only state completely within the Appalachian Mountain range, aptly given the nickname the Mountain State.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-west-virginians-call-themselves>What do West Virginians call themselves?</h2>

<p>Other recreational opportunities are all around it: hiking, ziplining, hunting, fishing, bird-watching, camping, biking, and rock climbing. One of the state’s most photographed sights is the soaring New River Bridge, the longest steel span in the hemisphere and the nation’s third highest, 876 feet above the canyon floor.</p>

<p>Generalizations are often made about the more rural states. West Virginians are definitely no strangers to being portrayed stereotypically. Since the Mountain State’s inception, West Virginians have often been portrayed as backwoods, toothless hillbillies.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-weird-things-people-say-in-west-virginia>Are there weird things people say in West Virginia?</h2>

Of course, these weird things people say in West Virginia just might give my homeland away. What is something that you always hear in West Virginia?</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-west-virginians-get-their-reputation>How did the West Virginians get their reputation?</h2>
<p>It began in the 1800s when writers came to West Virginia and told tales of depressed and isolated communities.
