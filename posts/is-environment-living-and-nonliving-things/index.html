<h2 id=is-environment-living-and-nonliving-things>Is environment living and nonliving things?</h2>
<p>An environment includes living things such as plants, animals, people, and even the tiniest of microbes. The living portions of the environment are called the biotic parts. The nonliving portions, such as rocks, sunlight, and air, are called the abiotic parts.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-interrelationship-between-living-and-non-living-things>What is the interrelationship between living and non living things?</h2>
<p>The relationship between the living and non-living things forms an ecosystem. The non- living things like water, air, soil and other are required by the living organisms for leading their life cycle. Thus this can be said that both living and non-living things are interdependent on each other and forms an ecosystem.</p>

<p>The Environment Living and Nonliving Things</p>
<table><tr><th>Living things in our environment</th><th>Non – living things in our environment</th></tr><tr><td>Animals</td><td>Vehicles</td></tr><tr><td>Plants</td><td>Land</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Air</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Water etc.</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-are-three-examples-of-non-living-things>What are three examples of non-living things?</h2>
<p>Some examples of non-living things include rocks, water, weather, climate, and natural events such as rockfalls or earthquakes. Living things are defined by a set of characteristics including the ability to reproduce, grow, move, breathe, adapt or respond to their environment.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-living-things-and-non-living-things-related>How are living things and non living things related?</h2>
<p>The interactions between living things and their non living environment makes up a total ecosystem; understanding any one part of it requires knowledge of how that part interacts with the others. Ecosystems do not ‘collapse’ but do change in function, structure and composition over time due to natural or human disturbance …</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-living-parts-of-the-environment>What are the living parts of the environment?</h2>
<p>The living portions of the environment are called the biotic parts. The nonliving portions, such as rocks, sunlight, and air, are called the abiotic parts. Interactions among organisms and their environments can be very complex because an organism gets everything it needs to survive from the biotic and abiotic parts of its environment.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-non-living-thing-change-in-size>How does a non living thing change in size?</h2>
<p>The change in the state of a non-living thing is due to an external influence. Non-living things “grow” by accretion. It occurs through adding materials externally. For example, A snowball may increase in size due to the accumulation of smaller units of its own to its outer surface.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-organisms-live-in-the-same-environment>What kind of organisms live in the same environment?</h2>
<p>Organisms that live in the same environment affect other living organisms within that community. For example, prairie dogs are rodents that can be found in the grasslands of western North America. They rely on the grasses in their environment as a food source and energy supply.</p>
