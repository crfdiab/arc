<p>5 Popular Animals that are Illegal as Pets in California</p>
<ul>
<li>Ferrets. California is one of the few states that prohibit pet ownership of ferrets.</li>
<li>Hedgehogs. Hedgehogs can be dangerous to people and are therefore illegal to keep as pets in California.</li>
<li>Monkeys.</li>
<li>Squirrels.</li>
<li>Gerbils.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-pet-is-illegal-in-california-and-hawaii>What pet is illegal in California and Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Ferrets<br>
Where Are Ferrets Illegal. There are two states where ferrets are completely illegal: California and Hawaii.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-exotic-pets-you-can-own-in-california>What are some exotic pets you can own in California?</h2>
<p>10 Exotic Pets That Are Legal to Own in California</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid Cats.</li>
<li>Zebras.</li>
<li>Monitor Lizards.</li>
<li>American Bison.</li>
<li>Second Generation ‘Wolfdogs’</li>
<li>Large Constrictor Snakes.</li>
<li>Toucans.</li>
<li>Camels.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=can-you-own-a-lion-in-the-us>Can you own a lion in the US?</h2>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, five states don’t ban residents from owning exotic pets — even lions, tigers, and bears. Nevada, Wisconsin, Alabama, North Carolina, and South Carolina each have lax laws when it comes to pet ownership. Still, some pets are more widely shunned than others.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-own-a-fennec-fox-in-california>Can I own a Fennec fox in California?</h2>
<p>Foxes may not be kept as pets in the state of California. Luckily for New Yorkers, fennec foxes are the only species from ‘The Big 5’ that are legal to own in the state. There are breeders of foxes in the state of California, but they have to sell out of state. It is not legal to have a fox as a pet in most states.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-own-a-monkey-in-california>Can I own a monkey in California?</h2>
<p>While monkeys are allowed as pets in neighboring Arizona and Nevada (with a license in the former), they are illegal to keep as pets in California. As is the case with most of the banned-animals list, the reason monkeys are a no go is because of the damage they can do to Californian wildlife and agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-ferrets-banned-in-california>Why are ferrets banned in California?</h2>
<p>The main reason why ferrets are illegal in California is to Protect Agriculture and Wildlife. The California Natural Resources Agency, which includes the Department of Fish and Wildlife, bans a variety of exotic pets, one of them being ferrets.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-own-a-lion-in-texas>Can I own a lion in Texas?</h2>
<p>Texas. A license is required to own many animals that the state of Texas considers to be dangerous. This list of animals includes bears, coyotes, chimps and other apes, lions, tigers, and many others. There are no laws regarding monkeys, wolves, capybaras, ferrets, lemurs, and other animals.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-have-a-pet-in-california>Is it legal to have a pet in California?</h2>
<p>However, there are only a few exotic pets legal in California. California has very strict laws about what types of animals homeowners can keep as pets. Some animals are banned as pets because they aren’t meant to be domesticated, others are dangerous to California’s ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-are-banned-in-california>What kind of animals are banned in California?</h2>
<p>Other animals banned as pets in California for a variety of reasons include monkeys, sloths, anteaters, moles, lemurs, weasels, foxes, coyotes, bears, elephants, manatees, zebras, camels and deer. Understanding D-Day: What Is the History of the Normandy Invasion?</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-have-a-monkey-in-california>Is it legal to have a monkey in California?</h2>
<p>Modern pet owners are finding more and more satisfaction from pets that are a little more exotic, maybe a monkey or a ferret or something even wilder. However, there are only a few exotic pets legal in California.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-have-a-ferret-as-a-pet-in-california>Is it illegal to have a ferret as a pet in California?</h2>
<p>Although disputed by ferret lovers, the California Department Fish of Wildlife takes the position that escaped or abandoned pet ferrets pose a significant risk to California’s rare native animals and birds.</p>
