<p>38 days<br>
Exemplifying the difficulty of the passage, it took Magellan 38 days to complete the crossing.</p>
<h2 id=did-ferdinand-magellan-reach-south-america>Did Ferdinand Magellan reach South America?</h2>
<p>What did Ferdinand Magellan discover? In 1520 Ferdinand Magellan discovered the channel linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, between the mainland tip of South America and Tierra del Fuego island.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-ferdinand-magellan-land-in-south-america>When did Ferdinand Magellan land in South America?</h2>
<p>1519<br>
The King of Spain gave Magellan five ships and he set off for South America in 1519. He sailed for three months until he found the dangerous strait between modern day Chile and the island of Tierra del Fuego. He named it after himself. The expedition sailed on through the Magellan Strait into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=who-first-traveled-around-the-world>Who first traveled around the world?</h2>
<p>Ferdinand Magellan<br>
Ferdinand Magellan (1480–1521) was a Portuguese explorer who is credited with masterminding the first expedition to circumnavigate the world.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-ferdinand-magellan-to-reach-the-pacific-ocean>How long did it take Ferdinand Magellan to reach the Pacific Ocean?</h2>
<p>It took 38 days to sail through the passage, and on November 28, 1520, Magellan and his remaining ships passed through the mouth of the strait and sailed into the “Sea of the South,” named years earlier by Balboa when he sighted it from land in Panama.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-ferdinand-magellan-reach-rio-de-la-plata>When did Ferdinand Magellan reach Rio de la Plata?</h2>
<p>Ferdinand Magellan reaches South America. There the crew was resupplied, but bad conditions caused them to delay. Afterwards, they continued to sail south along South America’s east coast, looking for the strait that Magellan believed would lead to the Spice Islands. The fleet reached Río de la Plata on January 10, 1520.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-magellans-circumnavigation>What was the purpose of Magellan’s circumnavigation?</h2>
<p>The goal of the expedition was to find a western route to the Moluccas (Spice Islands) and trade for spices. Magellan left Spain on 20 September 1519, sailed across the Atlantic, and discovered the strait that now bears his name, allowing him to pass through the southern tip of South America into the Pacific Ocean (which he named).</p>
<h2 id=where-did-magellan-think-he-had-found-the-spice-islands>Where did Magellan think he had found the Spice Islands?</h2>
<p>Cautious because of being in Portuguese waters, Magellan quickly resumed the voyage on a path towards the Great South Sea of the Orient. Magellan believed he had found the Spice Islands and exclaimed, “Montevideo,” that is, “I see a mountain”; but it was only the large delta of the Rio de la Plata.</p>
