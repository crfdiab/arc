<h2 id=who-were-the-first-people-to-come-to-the-colony>Who were the first people to come to the colony?</h2>
<p>The Spanish were among the first Europeans to explore the New World and the first to settle in what is now the United States. By 1650, however, England had established a dominant presence on the Atlantic coast. The first colony was founded at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607.</p>
<h2 id=who-colonized-the-country-in-the-early-1600s>Who colonized the country in the early 1600’s?</h2>
<p>In the early 1600’s, the English king began granting charters for the purpose of establishing colonies in America. By the mid-1700’s, most of the settlements had been formed into 13 British colonies. Each colony had a governor and legislature, but each was under the ultimate control of the British government.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-president-of-the-new-virginia-colony>Who was the first president of the new Virginia Colony?</h2>
<p>The first President of the new Virginia colony was to be Edward Maria Winfield. The other six council members were: Bartholomew Gosnold, Christopher Newport, John Martin, John Ratcliffe, George Kendall, and John Smith. By June 15, the fort was completed.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-jamestown-the-first-permanent-english-settlement-in-north-america>Why was Jamestown the first permanent English settlement in North America?</h2>
<p>The settlement became the first permanent English settlement in North America. The site for Jamestown was picked for several reasons, all of which met criteria the Virginia Company, who funded the settlement, said to follow in picking a spot for the settlement.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-slavery-begin-in-the-jamestown-colony>When did slavery begin in the Jamestown Colony?</h2>
<p>The arrival of the first captives to the Jamestown Colony, in 1619, is often seen as the beginning of slavery in America—but enslaved Africans arrived in North America as early as the 1500s.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-colony-of-new-south-wales-start>When did the colony of New South Wales start?</h2>
<p>On January 26, 1788, Captain Arthur Phillip guides a fleet of 11 British ships carrying convicts to the colony of New South Wales, effectively founding Australia. After overcoming a period of hardship, the fledgling colony began to celebrate the anniversary of this date with great fanfare and it eventually became commemorated as Australia Day.</p>
