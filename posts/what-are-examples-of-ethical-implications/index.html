<h2 id=what-are-examples-of-ethical-implications>What are examples of ethical implications?</h2>
<p>An ethical implication is that good people will do good deeds. A Boy Scout will help an elderly lady cross the street even if he had no intention of crossing. The result may not be entirely satisfactory if the lady does not want to cross the street, but the intention is good and ethical.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-ethical-implications-of-insider-trading>What are the ethical implications of insider trading?</h2>

<h2 id=what-are-the-ethical-issues-in-international-marketing>What are the ethical issues in international marketing?</h2>
<p>Some of the most common ethical issues in international business include outsourcing, working standards and conditions, workplace diversity and equal opportunity, child labor, trust and integrity, supervisory oversight, human rights, religion, the political arena, the environment, bribery and corruption.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-ethical-issues-and-implications>What are ethical issues and implications?</h2>
<p>Ethical issues occur when a given decision, scenario or activity creates a conflict with a society’s moral principles. Both individuals and businesses can be involved in these conflicts, since any of their activities might be put to question from an ethical standpoint.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-avoid-ethical-implications>How can we avoid ethical implications?</h2>
<p>Here are five recommendations APA’s Science Directorate gives to help researchers steer clear of ethical quandaries:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discuss intellectual property frankly.</li>
<li>Be conscious of multiple roles.</li>
<li>Follow informed-consent rules.</li>

</ol>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-have-ethical-implications>What does it mean to have ethical implications?</h2>
<p>An ethical implication is simply considering the matter from an ethical viewpoint. It may undermine an otherwise valid argument or a position derived from considering things other than ethics. For example, from a legal perspective, capital punishment means the state is sanctioned to kill murderers.</p>
<h2 id=is-inside-trading-ethical>Is inside trading ethical?</h2>
<p>To sum up, insider trading is selling or buying stocks, bonds, and securities from a company with nonpublic confidential information about the company. It is an unethical action done by the insiders because it is unfair for the other stockholders and investors.</p>
<h2 id=is-inside-trading-unethical>Is inside trading unethical?</h2>
<p>Insider trading is illegal, and is widely believed to be unethical. For a practice that has come to epitomize unethical business behavior, however, insider trading has received surprisingly little ethical analysis.</p>

<h2 id=the-impact-on-the-environment-is-there-an-insider-trading-law-in-singapore>The Impact on the Environment. Is there an insider trading law in Singapore?</h2>
<p>In Singapore, the Securities and Futures Act governs the prohibition of insider trading.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-ethical-to-trade-in-the-stock-market>Is it ethical to trade in the stock market?</h2>

This is as a result of the fact that the actions above were not conventional to “the principle tenet of trading at the security market, that is, no trader should have unjust gain when trading in the stock market” (Anthony 11).</p>
<h2 id=where-does-ethical-trade-and-fairtrade-come-from>Where does ethical trade and Fairtrade come from?</h2>
