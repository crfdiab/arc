<p>Many maintain that the primary cause of the war was the Southern states’ desire to preserve the institution of slavery. Others minimize slavery and point to other factors, such as taxation or the principle of States’ Rights.</p>
<h2 id=what-event-did-the-southern-states-feel-was-going-to-threaten-their-way-of-life>What event did the southern states feel was going to threaten their way of life?</h2>
