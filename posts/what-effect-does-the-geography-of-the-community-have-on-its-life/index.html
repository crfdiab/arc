<p>These features include vegetation, climate, the local water cycle, and land formations. Geography doesn’t just determine whether humans can live in a certain area or not, it also determines people’s lifestyles, as they adapt to the available food and climate patterns.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-geography-affect-the-development-of-a-civilization>How does geography affect the development of a civilization?</h2>
<p>The development of government was often impacted by the geography of a civilization: cities spread out over large territory = necessity for local governments. cities isolated by natural boundaries = development of competing states.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-purposes-of-geographic-study>What are the purposes of geographic study?</h2>
<p>1. Geography helps us understand basic physical systems that affect everyday life: How water cycles and ocean currents work are all explained with Geography. These are important systems to monitor and predict in order to help lessen the impact of disasters.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-geography-affect-the-people-that-live-there>How does geography affect the people that live there?</h2>
<p>Many more examples could be given considering that geography is a vast field with a multitude of ramifications. Suffice it to say, that nobody on earth is immune from the influence of their geography. As the previous poster pointed out, geography had a great deal to do with how certain communities developed.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-geography-and-climate-affect-economic-development>How does geography and climate affect economic development?</h2>
<p>And yet, one of the main factors for the economic development (and military strength) of a nation is its geographic location and climate. Geography and climate have major effects on economic growth and are an integral part of the economic policy a country chooses to take.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-geography-affect-the-development-of-civilizations>How does geography affect the development of civilizations?</h2>
<p>Even inland cities, like Chicago and Detroit, are situated on major bodies of water with access to shipping lanes. While geography played a major role in where civilizations began and where people settle, it has a corresponding effect on the cultures of those people who do settle there. For example, let’s look again at the early United States.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-geography-affect-the-development-of-the-united-states>How did geography affect the development of the United States?</h2>
<p>The United States began as a series of British colonies, and their colonial economies were largely based on trade with England and other parts of the British Empire. As such, many major cities in the eastern United States are either on an ocean (giving them a major port) or on another major waterway.</p>
