<h2 id=does-washington-dc-has-a-governor>Does Washington DC has a governor?</h2>

<p>Washington, D.C. The U.S. federal district of Washington, D.C., first required its residents to register their motor vehicles in 1903. Plates are currently issued by the District of Columbia Department of Motor Vehicles (DC DMV). …</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-named-district-of-columbia>Why is it named District of Columbia?</h2>
<p>The new federal territory was named District of Columbia to honour explorer Christopher Columbus, and the new federal city was named for George Washington.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-front-license-plate-in-dc>Do you need a front license plate in DC?</h2>
<p>Vehicles registered in the District of Columbia are required by law to display DC DMV-issued vehicle tags. Vehicles are required to display two current tags, one on the front and the other on the rear of the vehicle. …</p>
<h2 id=is-washington-dc-owned-by-the-us>Is Washington DC owned by the US?</h2>
<p>The role Washington plays as the capital of the United States often overshadows its lively local history and its complex political, economic, and social issues. About half the land in Washington is owned by the U.S. government , which pays no taxes on it. Several hundred thousand people in the D.C. metropolitan area work for the federal government.</p>
<h2 id=does-dc-have-congressional-representation>Does DC have congressional representation?</h2>
<p>As the federal capital, the District of Columbia is a special federal district, not a state, and therefore does not have voting representation in Congress. The Constitution grants Congress exclusive jurisdiction over the District in “all cases whatsoever”.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-dc-become-the-nations-capital>How did DC become the Nation’s capital?</h2>
<p>How did Washington DC become the nations capital. Answer. Washington, DC became the national capital because the southerners thought that the capital being in New York gave the northern states to much influence over national policy. The capital of the United States was then moved to Washington, DC after being in Philadelphia for 10 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-washington-dc-governed>How is Washington DC governed?</h2>
<p>Although the District of Columbia has its own municipal government, it receives funding from the federal government and relies on directives from Congress to approve its laws and budget. DC residents have only had the right to vote for the President since 1964 and for the Mayor and city council members since 1973.</p>
