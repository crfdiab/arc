<h2 id=what-was-one-of-the-main-sources-of-the-conflict-between-the-united-states-and-japan>What was one of the main sources of the conflict between the United States and Japan?</h2>
<p>To a certain extent, the conflict between the United States and Japan stemmed from their competing interests in Chinese markets and Asian natural resources. While the United States and Japan jockeyed peaceably for influence in eastern Asia for many years, the situation changed in 1931.</p>
<h2 id=what-resource-did-japan-need-from-the-united-states>What resource did Japan need from the United States?</h2>
<p>Instead, Japan received most of its oil from the United States and rubber from British Malaya, the very two Western nations trying to restrict Japan’s expansion.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-japan-and-the-united-states-in-the-early-1900s>What was the relationship between Japan and the United States in the early 1900s?</h2>
<p>In the first two decades of the twentieth century, the relationship between the United States and Japan was marked by increasing tension and corresponding attempts to use diplomacy to reduce the threat of conflict.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-united-states-control-japan>Does the United States control Japan?</h2>
<p>The US military this month will return to Japan’s government more than 9,800 acres of land it has held since World War II, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said Tuesday. The US had turned most of Okinawa over to Japan in 1972 after controlling it from the end of World War II in 1945.</p>
<h2 id=is-japan-rich-with-natural-resources>Is Japan rich with natural resources?</h2>
<p>Japan has always been described as a country with virtually no major natural resources such as natural gas, oil, gold, coal, copper, and iron. The country depends on imported raw material and energy. Japan has negligible mineral resources, especially under the seabed.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-japan-attack-hawaii>Why did Japan attack Hawaii?</h2>
<p>The Japanese intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-japan-interested-in-trade-with-the-us>Why was Japan interested in trade with the US?</h2>
<p>For the two centuries that followed, Japan limited trade access to Dutch and Chinese ships with special charters. There were several reasons why the United States became interested in revitalizing contact between Japan and the West in the mid-19th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-tension-between-japan-and-the-us>What was the tension between Japan and the US?</h2>
<p>Tension between Japan and the United States increased dramatically when Japan seized French Indo-China (now Vietnam) in July 1941. Japanese troops poured into Indo-China, and the Japanese military began preparations to attack the Philippines and British and Dutch colonial possessions in South-East Asia.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-respond-to-japanese-aggression>How did the US respond to Japanese aggression?</h2>
<p>President Roosevelt responded to Japanese aggression in Indo-China by placing an embargo on the sale of American oil and petroleum to Japan, and freezing Japan’s assets in the United States. The British government and the Dutch government-in-exile followed the lead of the United States in imposing economic sanctions on Japan.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-us-put-economic-sanctions-on-japan>Why did the US put economic sanctions on Japan?</h2>
<p>The British government and the Dutch government-in-exile followed the lead of the United States in imposing economic sanctions on Japan. By August 1941, Japan faced an almost total embargo on the oil and rubber it needed to continue its undeclared war on China, and to pursue further military aggression in South-East Asia.</p>
