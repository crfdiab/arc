<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-conserve-water-in-arizona>Why is it important to conserve water in Arizona?</h2>
<p>In case of a drought, there may be imposed water restrictions that impact everyone. Living in a desert means that we must conserve water due to the lack of rainfall. Each year, Arizona receives less than 10 inches of rain each year. It allows us to survive in the harsh desert climate with plenty of water.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-protect-our-water-supply>Why is it important to protect our water supply?</h2>
<p>Whether your drinking water comes from a lake, river, reservoir, or groundwater, it is important to protect the source from contamination. One of the best ways to protect your drinking water is to prevent pollution from getting into your drinking water source.</p>
<h2 id=does-arizona-have-water-problems>Does Arizona have water problems?</h2>
<p>There’s just one problem: The region doesn’t appear to have enough water for all the planned growth. In 2017, Phoenix became the fifth-largest city in the U.S., a sprawling “megalopolis” of almost 5 million people that’s also known as the Valley of the Sun.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-save-water-in-arizona>How can we save water in Arizona?</h2>
<p>Plant low-water use and drought-tolerant grasses, ground covers, shrubs and trees. Group plants according to their water needs. Minimize turf/grass areas. Check all hoses, connectors, and spigots regularly.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-give-water-in-arizona>Do you have to give water in Arizona?</h2>
<p>In Arizona, there is no statute that states it is illegal to refuse water to someone else in the state. In fact, even if someone was near death because of hydration, refusing to provide them with water would not be a criminal act (ethically, that is a different scenario).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-water-rights-in-arizona>What are water rights in Arizona?</h2>
<p>What is a “water right”? Broadly defined, a water right is the legal right to appropriate any unappropriated water for use in a beneficial purpose. This right can be claimed by a person, the State of Arizona, or political entity.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-we-do-to-protect-our-water-supply>What can we do to protect our water supply?</h2>
<p>Easy Things You Can Do To Protect Drinking Water Sources</p>
<ol>
<li>Properly dispose of hazardous products Put up signs.</li>
<li>Use and dispose of harmful materials properly.</li>
<li>Volunteer in your community.</li>
<li>Join in a beach, stream or wetland cleanup.</li>
<li>Prepare a presentation about your watershed for a school or civic organization.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-can-we-protect-our-drinking-water-clean>How can we protect our drinking water clean?</h2>
<p>Here are the top ten actions you can take to help keep drinking water sources clean in your community:</p>
<ol>
<li>Handle and dispose of waste properly:</li>
<li>Maintain heating oil tanks and fill lines:</li>
<li>Maintain and use septic systems properly:</li>
<li>Maintain wells:</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-does-the-state-of-arizona-manage-its-water>How does the state of Arizona manage its water?</h2>
<p>Arizona is a visionary of water planning and management. From water supply projects, to innovative programs including drought preparedness, underground water storage, 100-year water supply requirements, mandatory conservation programs and use of reclaimed water, we lead the nation in comprehensive water supply management.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-protect-freshwater-resources>Why is it important to protect freshwater resources?</h2>
<p>Establish protected wetlands areas. The local governments would have a part to play in wetland protection, because they have primary responsibility for local land use management. There should regulation of water withdrawal from human. This should be done by limiting the human use of the freshwater sources.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-arizona-start-storing-water-in-reservoirs>When did Arizona start storing water in reservoirs?</h2>
<p>In most cases the water stored in these reservoirs has been in place for millions of years. In 1980 Arizona passed the Groundwater Management Act which protects water users and reduces the State’s reliance on the use of unsustainable groundwater supplies in the State’s most heavily populated areas.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-arizona-coping-with-the-current-drought>How is Arizona coping with the current drought?</h2>
<p>In urban areas, Arizona has already made significant investments in importing and storing water supplies, providing an important buffer against impacts of the current drought. The U.S. Drought Monitor is the official record of drought for Federal drought relief claims.</p>
