<h2 id=can-hurricanes-be-accurately-predicted>Can hurricanes be accurately predicted?</h2>
<p>By the time a storm makes landfall, the difference between its predicted and real locations is less, on average, than 8 miles (and in Laura’s case, much less). The lead time has also grown: A five-day track forecast today is as accurate as a three-day one was in 2001.</p>
<h2 id=how-accurate-are-hurricane-models-5-days-out>How accurate are hurricane models 5 days out?</h2>
<p>Above: Verification of official NHC hurricane track forecasts for the Atlantic, 1990 – 2017. The average track errors for official NHC forecasts in 2017 were 37 miles for a 1-day forecast, 65 miles for a 2-day forecast, 101 miles for 3 days, 131 miles for 4 days, and 179 miles for 5 days.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-out-can-hurricanes-be-predicted>How far out can hurricanes be predicted?</h2>
<p>Scientists can usually predict its path for 3-5 days in advance. A hurricane’s possible trajectory is usually represented as a cone, which shrinks over time as the error in the prediction decreases.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-accurate-hurricane-tracking-model>What is the most accurate hurricane tracking model?</h2>
<p>The most well-known models – the Euro, GFS, Canadian, and others – all have ensembles. An ensemble is a collection of forecasts all valid at the same forecast time. For instance, the GFS is run many times with slightly varying initial conditions and physics to get the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-accurate-forecast-model>What is the most accurate forecast model?</h2>
<p>The ECMWF is generally considered to be the most accurate global model, with the US’s GFS slightly behind.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-are-hurricane-predictions-100-percent-accurate>How often are hurricane predictions 100 percent accurate?</h2>
<p>After comparing annual predictions to actual weather, Seaworthy discovered that out of 22 years of hurricane season activity forecasts, only one was 100 percent accurate. In some years, there were up to eight more storms than predicted (click here for chart with data).</p>
<h2 id=how-is-hot-spot-accuracy-for-hurricane-landfall>How is hot spot accuracy for hurricane landfall?</h2>
<p>Tracked the last 15 United States Hurricane Landfalls 4. Outlook Webinars Look 2 Weeks into the Future 5. Tracking Webinars – daily if landfall expected 6. Provides Additional Time to Prepare 7. Ask questions during the webinars 8. Daily tracking webinars if storm is expected to landfall 9. Prediction Zones – 87% hot spot accuracy since 2009 10.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-scientists-able-to-predict-tropical-storms>How are scientists able to predict tropical storms?</h2>
<p>Scientists can predict the number of named storms and their breakdown by intensity (i.e. the number of hurricanes, tropical storms, intense hurricanes, etc.). They can also predict approximate wind speeds and intensity for sustained winds. These can be easily calculated using elementary statistics.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-scientists-say-hurricanes-will-hit-florida>When do scientists say hurricanes will hit Florida?</h2>
<p>Scientists cannot say that the third named storm of the season will hit Florida on June 30th. They can only say that there is a five percent chance of a major hurricane hitting the coast from April to November. Once a hurricane has formed, it can be tracked. Scientists can usually predict its path for 3-5 days in advance.</p>
