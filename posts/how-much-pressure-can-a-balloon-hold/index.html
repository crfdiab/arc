<h2 id=how-much-pressure-can-a-balloon-hold>How much pressure can a balloon hold?</h2>
<p>One experiment shows that the balloon reaches a relatively constant pressure of 810 mmHg until it gets close to its maximum elasticity point and then increases to 820, 830 and finally 840 mmHg when it pops.</p>
<h2 id=do-bigger-balloons-have-more-pressure>Do bigger balloons have more pressure?</h2>
<p>If the size becomes tripled, the force will be tripled, but the surface area will be 9 times as big, so the pressure will be only one-third. That is why bigger a balloon is, lower the air pressure is. So, if you connect two balloons with different sizes, the air pressure of the smaller balloon beat the bigger one’s.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-smaller-balloons-have-higher-air-pressure>Why do smaller balloons have higher air pressure?</h2>
<p>When the valve is released, air will flow from the balloon at higher pressure to the balloon at lower pressure. The lower pressure balloon will expand. So, when the valve is opened, the smaller balloon pushes air into the larger balloon. It becomes smaller, and the larger balloon becomes larger.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-calculate-the-pressure-of-a-balloon>How do you calculate the pressure of a balloon?</h2>
<p>pv=niu*R*T ( eq. 1) . If you find the number of moles ( niu ) you’ll get the pressure ( since you can calculate , with a good approximation, the volume of the balloon using a water container and sinking it into this water, measuring the difference between the initial and the final levels of water etc. ).</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-pressure-when-you-inflate-a-balloon>What happens to the pressure when you inflate a balloon?</h2>
<p>When you inflate a balloon, you’re actually putting gases, in this case mostly helium, into an elastic container. As you add more gas, the pressure inside the balloon increases, and in response, the balloon expands… As you go higher into the atmosphere, the air becomes thinner, and the atmospheric pressure drops.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-two-small-balloons-as-you-push-up>What happened to the two small balloons as you push up?</h2>
<p>When one pushes up on the diaphragm, the balloons deflate completely, and when one pulls down on the diaphragm, they inflate. When you push up on the diaphram, you lower the volume in the bell jar, increasing the pressure and forcing the air out of the balloons until they collapse.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-two-small-balloons-inside-as-you-pull-down>What happened to the two small balloons inside as you pull down?</h2>
<p>Answer: As The Balloon At The Bottom Of The Model Was Pulled Down, The Diaphragm Contracts And Moves Down And The Chest Cavity Expands. There Is More Space And Less Pressure Inside The Lungs. When The Diaphragm Contracts, The Air Goes Into The Lungs Or The Inhalation Process Occurs.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-two-inflated-balloons-are-brought-close-together>What happens when two inflated balloons are brought close together?</h2>
<p>The Science Like charges repel (the two balloons, once charged, will move away from each other) and opposite charges attract (the paper will be attracted to the charged balloons.) Your positively charged hair is attracted to the negatively charged balloon and starts to rise up to meet it.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-excess-pressure-in-the-air-inside-a-balloon>Is there excess pressure in the air inside a balloon?</h2>
<p>There is no excess pressure over the atmospheric pressure of 1 atm in the air inside the balloon at this stage. The amount of the tension in rubber for a certain stretch is proportional to the amount of material of the rubber.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-forces-on-a-hot-air-balloon>What are the forces on a hot air balloon?</h2>
<p>Here the internal pressure of the balloon is the same as the exter- nal atmospheric pressure, the differential is zero. Therefore the forces near the throat are zero. As we move up the side of the balloon the pressure increases. However, all vertical components of the force point downward and oppose lift.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-air-filled-balloons-and-helium-balloons>What’s the difference between air filled balloons and helium balloons?</h2>
<p>Air-filled balloons do not float. Messages, Graphics, and Designs – One similarity between the two types of balloons is that both can be can be enhanced with written messages, graphics, and designs.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-common-type-of-balloon>Which is the most common type of balloon?</h2>
<p>The most common type of balloons is of course the latex balloons. These balloons inflate to an oval shape, are made of recyclable latex, and can be easily customized by screen printing your logo, text, or artwork design. They are usually available in size range from 9 inches to 18 inches.</p>
