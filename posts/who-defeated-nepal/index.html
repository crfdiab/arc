<h2 id=who-defeated-nepal>Who defeated Nepal?</h2>
<p>Since there was no clear border, confrontation between the two powers was “necessary and unavoidable”. Britain formally declared war on Nepal on the 1st of November, 1814.</p>
<h2 id=what-started-the-nepalese-civil-war>What started the Nepalese civil war?</h2>
<p>The rebellion was launched by the CPN-M on 13 February 1996 with the stated purpose of overthrowing the Nepalese monarchy and establishing a people’s republic. It ended with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord on 21 November 2006.</p>
<h2 id=does-nepal-have-war>Does Nepal have war?</h2>
<p>Nepal has been involved in many wars in its history….Gorkha Empire (1768-2008)</p>

<h2 id=who-was-the-winner-of-the-anglo-nepalese-war>Who was the winner of the Anglo Nepalese War?</h2>
<p>The Anglo-Nepalese War (1 November 1814 – 4 March 1816), also known as the Gurkha War, was fought between the Kingdom of Gorkha (present-day Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal) and the East India Company (EIC, present-day India). Both sides had ambitious expansion plans for the mountainous north of the Indian subcontinent. The EIC won.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-nepalese-confederacy>Who was the leader of the Nepalese Confederacy?</h2>
<p>Until that time only the Kathmandu valley was referred to as Nepal. The confederacy requested help from the East India Company and an ill-equipped and ill-prepared expedition numbering 2,500 was led by Captain Kinlock in 1767 AD.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-ruler-of-nepal-in-the-16th-century>Who was the ruler of Nepal in the 16th century?</h2>
<p>By the 16th century virtually all these principalities were ruled by dynasties claiming high-caste Indian origin whose members had fled to the hills in the wake of Muslim invasions of northern India.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-sino-nepalese-war>What was the outcome of the Sino Nepalese War?</h2>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the Sino-Nepalese War (1789–1792 AD ), Nepal was forced to sign the ‘Treaty of Betrawati’ which stipulated that the Government of Nepal was required to make payment of tribute to Qing court in Peking once every five years, after the defeat of Gurkha forces by the Qing army in Tibet.</p>
