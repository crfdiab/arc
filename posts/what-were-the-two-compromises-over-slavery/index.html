<h2 id=what-were-the-two-compromises-over-slavery>What were the two compromises over slavery?</h2>
<p>Finally, the Compromise of 1850 banned the slave trade in Washington, D.C. The hotly debated Kansas Nebraska Act of 1854 completely repealed, or reversed, the Missouri Compromise of 1820 in the sense that states could decide if they wanted to uphold slavery within their own borders or not.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-great-compromise-do-for-slavery>What did the Great Compromise do for slavery?</h2>
<p>A special committee worked out another compromise: Congress would have the power to ban the slave trade, but not until 1800. The convention voted to extend the date to 1808. A final major issue involving slavery confronted the delegates. Southern states wanted other states to return escaped slaves.</p>

<p>They worked out a compromise with the Southern states. They agreed that Congress could not tax exports and that no law could be passed to ban the slave trade until 1808. And in a final concession to the South, the delegates approved a fugitive slave clause.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-two-main-compromises-of-the-constitutional-convention>What were the two main compromises of the Constitutional Convention?</h2>
<p>The two main compromises were the Great Compromise and the 3/5 Compromise. The Great Compromise created a bicameral legislature. It created the House of Representatives, in which the representation of the states depended on their population, and the Senate, in which each state had an equal number of representatives.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-compromises-fail-to-keep-the-union-together>Why did the compromises fail to keep the union together?</h2>
<p>The country’s compromises over slavery, from the three-fifths compromise in 1787 through the 1850s, were trying to balance opposites — ownership of one person by another vs freedom — that, ultimately, could not be reconciled. …</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-first-compromise-on-the-issue-of-slavery>What was the first compromise on the issue of slavery?</h2>
<p>Henry Clay. Getty Images The Missouri Compromise, enacted in 1820, was the first real legislative attempt to find a solution to the issue of slavery. As new states entered the Union, the question of whether those states would allow the practice of slavery (and thus come in as a “slave state”) or not (as a “free state”) arose.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-compromise-at-the-constitutional-convention>What was the compromise at the Constitutional Convention?</h2>
<p>Also known as the Connecticut Compromise, a major compromise at the Constitutional Convention that created a two-house legislature, with the Senate having equal representation for all states and the House of Representatives having representation proportional to state populations.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-compromise-between-the-southern-states>What was the compromise between the southern states?</h2>
<p>Southern states fought for slaves to be counted in terms of representation. The compromise between the two became known as the three-fifths compromisebecause every five slaves would be counted as three individuals in terms of representation.
