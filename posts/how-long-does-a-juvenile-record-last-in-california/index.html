<h2 id=how-long-does-a-juvenile-record-last-in-california>How long does a juvenile record last in California?</h2>
<p>This section refers to felony offenses and for which you were adjudged to not be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court. Otherwise, your juvenile records will be destroyed when: 5 years have passed when your records were ordered sealed by the court if you were declared a ward of the court.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-juvenile-felony-go-away-in-california>Does a juvenile felony go away in California?</h2>
<p>California Juvenile Records Automatically Sealed Upon Completion of Probation. The California State Legislature amended Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code which now allows for juvenile records to be sealed automatically after the case is dismissed.</p>
<h2 id=does-your-juvenile-record-get-erased>Does your juvenile record get erased?</h2>
<p>When you commit an offence as a child and if you are convicted of that offence, it will show up on a criminal record until it becomes spent. For convictions received in the Children’s Court, they will only become spent once you complete a ‘crime free period’ from the date you are convicted in the Children’s Court.</p>
<h2 id=does-juvie-go-on-your-permanent-record>Does juvie go on your permanent record?</h2>
<p>The short answer is “it could.” Having a juvenile record is serious. But, unlike an adult criminal record, it can be expunged — either destroyed or sealed — when you reach a certain age. Your juvenile record is not automatically expunged once you turn 18.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-have-to-disclose-my-juvenile-record-in-california>Do I have to disclose my juvenile record in California?</h2>
<p>IMPORTANT: Even if you are not directly asked to disclose your juvenile record on an application, you may want to anyway. HOWEVER, when you get your juvenile record sealed in California, it’s as if it never existed. So, if you got your juvenile record sealed, you do not need to disclose anything in it.</p>
<h2 id=does-your-record-clear-when-you-turn-18-in-california>Does your record clear when you turn 18 in California?</h2>
<p>No. This is a myth. Records do not get sealed automatically when you turn 18 years of age. The only mechanism to get your records sealed automatically is when you complete the terms and conditions of a plea agreement called DEJ, deferred entry of judgment.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-get-my-juvenile-records-in-california>How do I get my juvenile records in California?</h2>
<p>To get information about your Juvenile Justice file (and find out if you have one), you must go to the Juvenile Justice Clerk’s Office at the Juvenile Justice Courthouse in person with a picture ID.</p>
<h2 id=do-juvenile-records-show-on-fbi-background-checks>Do juvenile records show on FBI background checks?</h2>
<p>Getting your juvenile record sealed prevents it from showing up on most background checks. However, your sealed juvenile record may still show up in a FBI background check ─ which may be required for jobs related to working with children and vulnerable adults, law enforcement, the federal government, or the military.</p>
<h2 id=what-age-does-your-criminal-record-clear>What age does your criminal record clear?</h2>
<p>Although convictions and cautions stay on the Police National Computer until you reach 100 years old (they are not deleted before then), they don’t always have to be disclosed. Many people don’t know the details of their record and it’s important to get this right before disclosing to employers.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-get-a-copy-of-my-juvenile-record-in-california>How can I get a copy of my juvenile record in California?</h2>
<p>The required forms are: Petition to Obtain Report of Law Enforcement Agency (JV-575) and Notice to Child and Parent/Guardian re: Release of Juvenile Police Records and Objection (JV-580) . The completed forms can be mailed or delivered to the Juvenile Court Records Department at the Lamoreaux Justice Center.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-a-misdemeanor-stay-on-your-record-in-california>How long does a misdemeanor stay on your record in California?</h2>
<p>A misdemeanor stays on your record for life unless you successfully petition for expungement. There is no preset “expiration date” for misdemeanor crimes. Even though misdemeanor offenses are less serious than felonies, they are still serious breaches in the eyes of the law.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-a-juvenile-criminal-record-stay-on-record>How long does a juvenile criminal record stay on record?</h2>
<p>For juveniles, convictions remain on the record for five years from the time of sentencing. This means that subject to certain exceptions, your criminal history check will not reveal convictions incurred outside this timeframe.</p>
<h2 id=when-to-challenge-a-criminal-record-in-california>When to challenge a criminal record in California?</h2>
<p>If you feel the information contained within your criminal history is incorrect, you may submit a formal challenge to the Department of Justice only after you have received a copy of your record from the Department, pursuant to California Penal Code sections 11120-11127.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-does-a-criminal-record-have-to-be-to-be-released>How old does a criminal record have to be to be released?</h2>
<p>five years from the time of sentencing if you were under 18 years at the time of sentencing. Sometimes a criminal record that is more than ten years old may be released if: a firearms licence. Was this helpful? How could we make this page better? How could we make this page better?</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-records-from-the-doj>How long does it take to get records from the DOJ?</h2>
<p>Identifying records: To help us provide records promptly, please provide specific information about the records you seek including the record name, subject matter, and location within the office if known. Time Deadlines: The DOJ has 10 days to determine if it will disclose the requested records.</p>
