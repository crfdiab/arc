<h2 id=what-were-the-2-main-reasons-for-european-exploration>What were the 2 main reasons for European Exploration?</h2>
<p>The two main reasons for European exploration were to gain new sources of wealth. By exploring the seas, traders hoped to find new, faster routes to Asia—the source of spices and luxury goods. Another reason for exploration was spreading Christianity to new lands.</p>

<li>Jessica Watson – Circumnavigator.</li>
<li>Eric Larson – Polar Explorer.</li>
<li>David de Rothschild – Voyager.</li>
<li>Andrew Skurka – Alaska-Yukon Explorer.</li>

<h2 id=why-do-scientists-and-explorers-go-on-expeditions>Why do scientists and explorers go on expeditions?</h2>
<p>With an expedition, scientists or explorers have some background knowledge but seek evidence, or data, to help in answering specific questions. Expeditions also require substantial planning to ensure they are able to achieve this purpose.) Have students share their ideas with the class.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-explorers-do-during-the-age-of-exploration>What did the explorers do during the age of exploration?</h2>
<p>Other important voyages of exploration during this era included Ferdinand Magellan’s attempted circumnavigation of the globe, the search for a trade route to Asia through the Northwest Passage, and Captain James Cook’s voyages that allowed him to map various areas and travel as far as Alaska.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-want-to-explore-the-new-world>Why did people want to explore the New World?</h2>
<p>One reason that they claimed the land was to gain riches from it. A third reason for exploration was to spread the message of Christianity. Some explorers believed that their journeys were the will of God. They believed it to be their duty to convert the native people to Christianity. <a href=https://www.lee.k12.nc.us/cms/lib03/NC01001912/Centricity>https://www.lee.k12.nc.us/cms/lib03/NC01001912/Centricity</a>…</p>
<h2 id=how-are-reasons-for-exploration-have-changed-over-time>How are reasons for exploration have changed over time?</h2>
<p>Explain that it is now important to discuss how explorations have changed over time because exploration has continually shaped our world (e.g., spice routes and connecting cultures). Ask students: How might reasons for exploration have changed over time? What ways do you think exploration has shaped our world?</p>
