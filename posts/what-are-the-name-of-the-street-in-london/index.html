At 410 miles the A1 is Britain’s longest road, connecting London to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The only house in the City of London to survive to our own times from before the Great Fire in 1666, 41 Cloth Fair was built between 1597 and 1614, making it the oldest house in the city.

<h2 id=how-old-is-the-oldest-pub-in-london>How old is the oldest pub in London?</h2>
<p>Okay, so the current building is a replica built in 1920, but a pub has been standing here for almost six hundred years, so it’s still one of the oldest pubs in London. The Samuel Smith Brewery owns and operates this place, so you won’t get as much variety here.</p>
