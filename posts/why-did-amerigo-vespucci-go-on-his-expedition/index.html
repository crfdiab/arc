<h2 id=why-did-amerigo-vespucci-go-on-his-expedition>Why did Amerigo Vespucci go on his expedition?</h2>
<p>The king asked Amerigo to go as a pilot on one of the ships going south for exploration. His duties would include cartography and astronomy to help with navigation. Amerigo Vespucci began his voyage on May 18, 1499.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-amerigo-vespucci-go-on-his-second-voyage>Where did Amerigo Vespucci go on his second voyage?</h2>
<p>Under Portuguese auspices Vespucci completed a second expedition, which set off from Lisbon on May 13, 1501. After a halt at the Cape Verde Islands, the expedition traveled southwestward and reached the coast of Brazil toward Cape St. Augustine.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-amerigo-vespucci-write-to>Who did Amerigo Vespucci write to?</h2>
<p>Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de’ Medici<br>
Mundus Novus (1503) was a letter written to Vespucci’s former schoolmate and one-time patron, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de’ Medici.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-amerigo-vespucci-go-to-south-america>When did Amerigo Vespucci go to South America?</h2>
<p>Amerigo discovered the northern part of South America in 1499. He even went deeper into the great river of Amazon. Later, in his third voyage to the western world in 1502, Amerigo set foot in the Bahamas. So, according to the dates of the two voyages, Columbus was the first man in the Colonial period who discovered America.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-education-did-amerigo-vespucci-have>What kind of Education did Amerigo Vespucci have?</h2>
<p>Vespucci was the son of Nastagio, a notary. As a boy Vespucci was given a humanistic education by his uncle Giorgio Antonio. In 1479 he accompanied another relation, sent by the famous Italian family of Medici to be their spokesman to the king of France.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-amerigo-vespucci-write-his-first-letter>Where did Amerigo Vespucci write his first letter?</h2>
<p>Two series of documents on his voyages are extant. The first series consists of a letter in the name of Vespucci dated from Lisbon, Portugal, September 4, 1504, written in Italian, perhaps to the gonfalonier (magistrate of a medieval Italian republic) Piero Soderini, and printed in Florence in 1505;</p>
<h2 id=when-did-amerigo-vespucci-become-manager-of-sevilla-agency>When did Amerigo Vespucci become manager of Sevilla agency?</h2>
<p>When Berardi died, either at the end of 1495 or at the beginning of 1496, Vespucci became manager of the Sevilla agency. Did you know? Thefirst use of the name “America” was in 1507, when a new world map was created based on the explorations of Amerigo Vespucci. The period during which Vespucci made his voyages falls between 1497 and 1504.</p>
