<h2 id=how-did-joan-of-arc-impact-the-world>How did Joan of Arc impact the world?</h2>
<p>Joan of Arc famous? Joan of Arc is a national heroine of France. She was a peasant girl who, believing that she was acting under divine guidance, led the French army in a momentous victory at Orléans in 1429 that repulsed an English attempt to conquer France during the Hundred Years’ War.</p>
<h2 id=do-people-worship-joan-of-arc>Do people worship Joan of Arc?</h2>
<p>According to sources from witnesses at her trial and her execution, Joan never wavered in her religious devotion; she was able to astound the theologians present at her trial with her eloquent and knowledgeable answers (Taylor, The Virgin Warrior, 137), and she spent her dying breath crying out to God and Mary.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-stjoan-of-arc-relevant-today>How is St.Joan of Arc relevant today?</h2>
<p>How is Joan of Arc relevant today? St. Joan of Arc is a shining example that proves that faith in God provides extraordinary power. She did as God told her. As she grew up, these “voices” in her head from God commanded her. These were initially things like “go to Mass” and “look out for those in need,” and she followed what God told her.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-bones-that-belong-to-joan-of-arc>Are there any bones that belong to Joan of Arc?</h2>
<p>A new series of DNA tests of bones and tissue found among the ashes is expected to confirm that they belong to a female. These initial discoveries suggest recent controversial claims surrounding the death of Joan of Arc are wrong.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-joan-of-arc-want-to-retake-paris>Why did Joan of Arc want to retake Paris?</h2>
<p>Joan argued that the French should press their advantage with an attempt to retake Paris, but Charles wavered, even as his favorite at court, Georges de La Trémoille, warned him that Joan was becoming too powerful. The Anglo-Burgundians were able to fortify their positions in Paris and turned back an attack led by Joan in September.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-joan-of-arc-win-charles-vii-over>How did Joan of Arc win Charles VII over?</h2>
<p>In a private audience at his castle at Chinon, Joan of Arc won the future Charles VII over by supposedly revealing information that only a messenger from God could know; the details of this conversation are unknown.</p>
