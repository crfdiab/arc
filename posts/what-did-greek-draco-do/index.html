<h2 id=what-did-greek-draco-do>What did Greek Draco do?</h2>
<p>Draco (/ˈdreɪkoʊ/; Greek: Δράκων, Drakōn; fl. 7th century BC), also called Drako or Drakon, was the first recorded legislator of Athens in Ancient Greece. He replaced the prevailing system of oral law and blood feud by a written code to be enforced only by a court of law.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-draco-die-athens>How did Draco die Athens?</h2>
<p>According to a number of Greek historians, Draco died in the Aeginetan theatre around 600 B.C. when people, who in a display of approval, threw so many hats and cloaks over him and he suffocated to death.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-greek-code-of-draco>What is the Greek code of Draco?</h2>
<p>The Draconian constitution, or Draco’s code, was a written law code created by Draco near the end of the 7th century BC in response to the unjust interpretation and modification of oral law by Athenian aristocrats. The literate could read the code at a central location accessible to anyone.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-greatest-accomplishment-of-the-greek-tyrant-draco>What was the greatest accomplishment of the Greek tyrant Draco?</h2>
<p>Draco – Lawgiver… Born in 650 B.C., Drako, also spelled as Draco or Drakon, was the first Athenian legislator according to the dates on records we have found. His greatest contribution, the one which allows his name to carry on, would be the “Draconian Constitution,” or Draconian law.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-draco-malfoys-first-kiss>Who was Draco Malfoy’s first kiss?</h2>
<p>Draco turned over and gave him a little smirk. “Goodnight Potter.” He leaned forward and kissed Harry gently. Both boys soon fell to sleep, this time with dreams of tea and magic.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-dracos-first-kiss>Who was Draco’s first kiss?</h2>
<p>Harry checks the Marauder’s Map in his dorm and decides that Draco should never be in the tower alone, so he sneaks out of bed to meet him. Harry sits down next to Draco and with only the light of the stars to see, he takes Draco’s arm and kisses the Dark Mark, then he kisses Draco on the lips.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-draco-mean>What does Draco mean?</h2>
<p>dragon<br>
Noun. Latin (genitive Draconis), literally, dragon — more at dragon.</p>
<h2 id=what-laws-did-draco-make>What laws did Draco make?</h2>
<p>Draconian laws, traditional Athenian law code allegedly introduced by Draco c. 621 bce. Aristotle, the chief source for knowledge of Draco, claims that his were the first written Athenian laws and that Draco established a constitution enfranchising hoplites, the lower class soldiers.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-harry-kiss-draco>Why does Harry kiss Draco?</h2>
<p>Harry sits down next to Draco and with only the light of the stars to see, he takes Draco’s arm and kisses the Dark Mark, then he kisses Draco on the lips. Soft and slow, he wants to show Draco that he loves every part of him, every piece that’s made him who he is. Their first kiss happens on the Quidditch pitch.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-athens-after-the-draco>Who was the leader of Athens after the Draco?</h2>
<p>About 25 years after the Draco, Athens received new and more advanced laws enacted by Solon. Bust of Solon from the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. SOLON was the Athenian eupatridae who in 612 BC. persuaded the Athenians to kidnap from Megarians Salamis island, which they successfully captured.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-draco-the-first-greek-lawgiver>Why was Draco the first Greek lawgiver?</h2>
<p>…affair that the Athenian lawgiver Draco gave the city its first comprehensive law code (perhaps 621). Because of the code’s extreme harshness, Draco ’s name has become a synonym for legal savagery.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-draco-and-what-did-he-do>Who was Draco and what did he do?</h2>
<p>Draco, who was the Athenian eupatridae, arranged the material of earlier thesmothetai and codified former common law, acquitting it from abuse of judges. He introduced the distinction between manslaughter and murder in the first degree and defined incitement to murder. His laws were known only from quotations in the murder and blood feuds.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-draconian-and-what-did-he-do>Who was draconian and what did he do?</h2>
<p>Written By: Draco, also spelled Dracon, (flourished 7th century bc), Athenian lawgiver whose harsh legal code punished both trivial and serious crimes in Athens with death—hence the continued use of the word draconian to describe repressive legal measures.</p>
