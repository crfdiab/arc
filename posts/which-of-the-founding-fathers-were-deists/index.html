<h2 id=which-of-the-founding-fathers-were-deists>Which of the Founding Fathers were deists?</h2>
<p>Founders who fall into the category of Christian Deists include Washington (whose dedication to Christianity was clear in his own mind), John Adams, and, with some qualifications, Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was more influenced by the reason-centred Enlightenment than either Adams or Washington.</p>
<h2 id=do-deists-believe-in-the-bible>Do Deists believe in the Bible?</h2>
<p>Deists insisted that religious truth should be subject to the authority of human reason rather than divine revelation. Consequently, they denied that the Bible was the revealed word of God and rejected scripture as a source of religious doctrine.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-most-religious-of-the-founding-fathers>Who was the most religious of the founding fathers?</h2>
<p>This week in our special series on the Founding Fathers Religion, we return to Thomas Jefferson, who likely wrote more on the subjects of God, Christianity, and Religion than any of the other Americans we attribute “founding father” status.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-founding-fathers-not-believe-in-a-god>Why did the founding fathers not believe in a god?</h2>
<p>As a group, the founders stopped short of religious establishment because of their own diversity and experience with state sponsored religion in Europe. However, they broadly recognized a “Creator” or “Nature’s God” without ascribing to one particular religion.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-founding-father-be-influenced-by-deism>Can a founding father be influenced by deism?</h2>
<p>One can differentiate a Founding Father influenced by Deism from an orthodox Christian believer by following certain criteria. Anyone seeking the answer should consider at least the following four points. First, an inquirer should examine the Founder’s church involvement.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-government-of-the-united-states-founded-on-the-christian-religion>Is the government of the United States founded on the Christian religion?</h2>
<p>“ “The Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.” These words, placed in the 1796 Treaty of Tripoli by founding father and first vice-president John Adams, are often used as a springboard for debate.</p>
