<h2 id=did-confucius-live-before-or-after-the-unification-of-china>Did Confucius live before or after the unification of China?</h2>
<p>The first unification of china dates back to the Qin Dynasty, which lasted from 220 to 206 BC. Confucius died in 479 BC. Therefore Confucius was alive before the first unification of China.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-confucius-alive>When was Confucius alive?</h2>
<p>Confucius, Pinyin romanization Kongfuzi or Kongzi, Wade-Giles K’ung-fu-tzu or K’ung-tzu, original name Kongqiu, literary name Zhongni, (born 551, Qufu, state of Lu [now in Shandong province, China]—died 479 bce, Lu), China’s most famous teacher, philosopher, and political theorist, whose ideas have profoundly …</p>
<h2 id=when-did-confucianism-take-over-china>When did Confucianism take over China?</h2>
<p>For centuries, Confucianism went in and out of favor in China. By the beginning of the Song Dynasty in A.D. 960, Daoism and Buddhism, a religion originating in India, were gaining popularity over Confucianism. A new movement of scholars, however, revived the teachings of Confucius and Mencius.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-confucius-unite-china>How did Confucius unite China?</h2>
<p>Confucius believed that social order, harmony, and good government could be restored in China if society were organized around five basic relationships. These were the relationships between: 1) ruler and subject, 2) father and son, 3) husband and wife, 4) older brother and younger brother, and 5) friend and friend.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-confucius-live-most-of-his-life>Where did Confucius live most of his life?</h2>
<p>Confucius was born to a once-aristocratic family in a small state called Lu, in northeastern China in 551 B.C., just before a period of political chaos known as the Warring States Period.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-confucius-institute-start-in-china>When did the Confucius Institute start in China?</h2>
<p>The Confucius Institute (CI) program, which began establishing centers for Chinese language instruction in 2004, has been the subject of criticisms, concerns, and controversies during its international expansion.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-known-as-the-father-of-confucius>Who was known as the father of Confucius?</h2>
<p>THE MAN WHO BECAME the father of Confucius was called Kung the Tall because he towered head and shoulders above everyone else in his village. Kung the Tall lived in China a very long time ago. Kung the Tall was living in China when Buddha was born in India. When this story begins Kung the Tall was an old man.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-confucius-develop-the-philosophy-of-confucianism>Why did Confucius develop the philosophy of Confucianism?</h2>
<p>These principles of Confucianism arose from the conflict in Confucius’ own life. He was born into a world that was on the brink of chaos. In fact, soon after his death, China would enter into a period known as the Warring States, during which China was divided and chaotic for nearly 200 years.</p>
