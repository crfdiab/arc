<h2 id=is-right-ascension-similar-to-latitude-on-earth>Is right ascension similar to latitude on Earth?</h2>
<p>On the celestial sphere, lines of right ascension and declination are similar to longitude and latitude lines on Earth. When a telescope’s right-ascension axis is lined up with the Earth’s axis, as shown here, the telescope can turn on it to follow the rotating sky.</p>
<h2 id=how-latitude-and-longitude-on-earth-are-similar-to-declination-and-right-ascension-in-the-sky>How latitude and longitude on Earth are similar to declination and right ascension in the sky?</h2>
<p>Declination is similar to latitude on earth and right ascension is similar to longitude. Declination is the angular north-south distance between the celestial equator and a location on the celestial plane. Right ascension is measured in the 24 hour time period it takes for the earth to rotate.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-right-ascension>What is meant by right ascension?</h2>
<p>Right ascension, in astronomy, the east–west coordinate by which the position of a celestial body is ordinarily measured; more precisely, it is the angular distance of a body’s hour circle east of the vernal equinox, measured along the celestial equator. See also hour angle.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-0-degrees-right-ascension>Where is 0 degrees right ascension?</h2>
<p>Pisces<br>
Presently, it’s located in the constellation of Pisces, the Fish. The sky can be treated as a clock, since it wheels by as Earth rotates, so the zero point of right ascension is called “0h” for “zero hours.” Unlike longitude, right ascension is measured in just one direction — east.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-right-ascension>Why is it called right ascension?</h2>
<p>How right ascension got its name. Ancient astronomy was very concerned with the rise and set of celestial objects. The ascension was the point on the celestial equator (red) which rose or set at the same time as an object (green) on the celestial sphere.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-get-a-celestial-body>How do you get a celestial body?</h2>
<p>There is no subsitute for sitting under the stars with a map and red flashlight. Use a star map that plots all stars visible to the unaided eye. Start by finding well-known star patterns such as the Big Dipper, or the constellation of Orion or Cassiopeia. Continue by identifying neighboring star patterns.</p>
<h2 id=do-stars-really-move>Do stars really move?</h2>
<p>The stars are not fixed, but are constantly moving. The stars seem so fixed that ancient sky-gazers mentally connected the stars into figures (constellations) that we can still make out today. But in reality, the stars are constantly moving. They are just so far away that the naked eye cannot detect their movement.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-right-ascension>What is the purpose of right ascension?</h2>
<p>Along with the declination (Dec) and epoch, the ‘right ascension’ (RA) of an object is used to define its position on the celestial sphere in the equatorial coordinate system.</p>
<h2 id=can-right-ascension-be-negative>Can right ascension be negative?</h2>
<p>Declination (green) is measured in degrees north and south of the celestial equator. Right ascension, akin to longitude, is measured east from the equinox. Anything south of the equator has a negative declination written with a negative sign.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-declination-and-right-ascension>What is the difference between declination and right ascension?</h2>
<p>Declination (DEC) is the celestial sphere’s equivalent of latitude and it is expressed in degrees, as is latitude. For DEC, + and – refer to north and south, respectively. The celestial equator is 0° DEC, and the poles are +90° and -90°. Right ascension (RA) is the celestial equivalent of longitude.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-right-ascension-similar-to-longitude-and-latitude>How is right ascension similar to longitude and latitude?</h2>
<p>They are similar to the system of longitude and latitude used to locate places on Earth. Right Ascension is measured in hours (h), minutes (m) and seconds (s) and is similar to longitude on Earth. As the Earth rotates, stars appear to rise in the East and set in the West just like the Sun.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-right-ascension-and-declination-used-in-astronomy>How are right ascension and declination used in astronomy?</h2>
<p>Right Ascension and Declination are a system of coordinates used in astronomy to determine the location of stars, planets and other objects in the night sky. They are similar to the system of longitude and latitude used to locate places on Earth. Right Ascension (RA)</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-time-of-right-ascension-measured>How is the time of right ascension measured?</h2>
<p>Right Ascension (RA) Right Ascension is measured in hours (h), minutes (m) and seconds (s) and is similar to longitude on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-highest-point-in-the-sky-for-right-ascension>Which is the highest point in the sky for right ascension?</h2>
<p>The line which passes through the highest point in the sky, called the meridian, is the projection of a longitude line onto the celestial sphere. Since a complete circle contains 24 h of right ascension or 360° (degrees of arc), 1 24 of a circle is measured as 1 h of right ascension, or 15°; 1</p>
