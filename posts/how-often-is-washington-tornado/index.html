<h2 id=how-often-is-washington-tornado>How often is Washington tornado?</h2>
<p>In the same time period (1953–2004), Washington experienced only two tornadoes. However, this works out to around 0.56 tornadoes per 1,000 square miles (2,600 km2) per year, which is not statistically higher than average for the surrounding area.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-worst-tornado-in-washington-state>What was the worst tornado in Washington state?</h2>
<p>Of the four tornadoes, the most catastrophic event was a deadly F3 tornado that struck Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, the first F3 tornado to strike Oregon since June 3, 1894….1972 Portland–Vancouver tornadoes.</p>
<table><tr><td>Casualties</td><td>6 fatalities, 301 injuries</td></tr><tr><td>Damage</td><td>$25.55 million (1972 USD)</td></tr><tr><td>Areas affected</td><td>Northern Oregon, Washington</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=does-the-pacific-northwest-have-tornadoes>Does the Pacific Northwest have tornadoes?</h2>
<p>It is very rare for a tornado to reach the EF-3 range in the Pacific Northwest. On record, only three tornadoes have achieved F-3 status in Oregon and Washington combined. The strongest and deadliest tornado on record was rated F-3 (prior to the enhanced scale rating system) on April 5, 1972 in Vancouver, WA.</p>

<p>The 2018 Port Orchard tornado was a rare strong tornado that struck the city of Port Orchard, Washington on December 18, 2018. The National Weather Service office in Seattle rated the tornado as an EF2 following an on-site survey of the storm damage the day after the event.</p>
<h2 id=does-oregon-have-tornadoes>Does Oregon have tornadoes?</h2>
<p>Tornadoes can happen at any time of the year, in any state. Statistically, Oregon averages about 3 tornadoes a year.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-tornado-in-washington-state>When was the last tornado in Washington State?</h2>
<p>Washington may get a tornado or two every year, but they are usually small. One of the largest was an EF3 in 1972 in Vancouver that killed six people. (MORE: Seattle Forecast) Parts of the Northwest got more rain in a day or two over the weekend than typically falls in the entire month.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-wind-speed-of-the-tornado-in-seattle>What was the wind speed of the tornado in Seattle?</h2>
<p>A team from the National Weather Service office in Seattle went to the scene and confirmed the tornado from eyewitness accounts, meteorologist Johnny Burg said. The Weather Service classified the tornado as an EF1, with a maximum wind speed of 110 mph.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-tornadoes-over-the-past-48-hours>Where are the tornadoes over the past 48 hours?</h2>
<p>73 Tornadoes Reported Over Past 48 Hours NC:Tuesday, 07:15 AM CDT: 1 W LAKE WACCAMAW NC:Tuesday, 07:15 AM CDT: 5 ESE WHITEVILLE SC:Tuesday, 07:15 AM CDT: 1 N SAMPIT GA:Tuesday, 07:05 AM CDT: 1 N RICEBORO NC:Monday, 09:25 AM CDT: HAVELOCK FL:Monday, 09:09 AM CDT: 1 WNW LIVE OAK NC:Monday, 09:01 AM CDT: MAYSVILLE</p>
<h2 id=why-are-tornadoes-so-rare-in-urban-areas>Why are tornadoes so rare in urban areas?</h2>
<p>This myth likely emerged from the fact that tornadoes in major urban areas are relatively rare. Heck, tornadoes themselves are rare in themselves over the course of a given year, but their impact is potentially devastating so they get our attention.</p>
