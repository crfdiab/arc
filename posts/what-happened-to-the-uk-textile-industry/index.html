<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-uk-textile-industry>What happened to the UK textile industry?</h2>
<p>Britain’s textile industry had all but disappeared by the 1980s, despite remaining the fourth largest manufacturing employer in the UK at this point. As demand for cheap clothing grew, retailers increasingly looked to cost-effective ways of gaining stock to fill their shelves.</p>
<h2 id=did-textiles-come-from-england>Did textiles come from England?</h2>
<p>Britain had long manufactured textiles The damp climate is good for grazing sheep, so for centuries, the country was renowned for its fine woolens. Flax, the raw material for linen, also thrives in rain. Textile workers plied their craft at home, sometimes to supplement farming.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-british-export-their-textiles-to-during-the-industrial-revolution>Where did the British export their textiles to during the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>At this time, Britain largely controlled international trade, and most global trade was conducted within Europe, but by the late 1790s 57 percent of British exports went to North America and the West Indies, and 32 percent of British imports were provided by these regions.</p>
<h2 id=who-brought-british-textile-technology-to-the-united-states>Who brought British textile technology to the United States?</h2>
<p>Known as the “Father of American Industry” Samuel Slater was an American Industrialist. He brought British textile technology to America. Slater established tenant farms and towns around his textile mills.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-textile-factories-are-there-in-uk>How many textile factories are there in UK?</h2>
<p>There are more than 4,200 businesses manufacturing textiles in the UK – an increase of 12% in the last five years – in a sector that employs more than 64,000 people.</p>
<h2 id=where-were-most-british-textile-mills-in-1850>Where were most British textile mills in 1850?</h2>
<p>Lancashire<br>
In 1850, Lancashire accounted for 66 per cent of spindles and in 1903 even for 79 per cent (BPP, 1850: BPP, 1903). Given that the cotton industry witnessed substantial change in terms of power technology, mechanization and processing techniques, this locational persistence is all the more remarkable.</p>
<h2 id=is-cotton-grown-in-england>Is cotton grown in England?</h2>
<p>Long before Manchester had football, it had cotton. The city and surrounding region was built on the success of spinning and sewing during the industrial revolution, giving rise to its catchy nickname, Cottonopolis.</p>
<h2 id=who-found-cotton-first>Who found cotton first?</h2>
<p>3000 B.C. – Cotton first cultivated as a fabric in the Indus River Valley (present-day Pakistan).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-textiles-industrialize-first>Why did textiles industrialize first?</h2>
<p>Textiles Industrialize First The demand for clothing in Britain had greatly increased as a result of the population boom caused by the agricultural revolution. These developments, in turn, had an impact worldwide. For example, the consumption of cotton rose dramatically in Britain (see graph at right).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-cotton-come-to-england>When did cotton come to England?</h2>
<p>sixteenth century<br>
It was first imported to Britain in the sixteenth century, composed of a mixture of linen or yarn. By 1750, cotton cloths were being produced and the imports of raw cotton from areas such as the West Indies continued to grow.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-started-industrialization-after-britain>What country started industrialization after Britain?</h2>
<p>The first European countries to be industrialized after England were Belgium, France and the German states. The rest of Europe didn’t industrialize until after 1850. Spain, Portugal, Austria-Hungary, Italy and the Ottoman Empire started to industrialize very late in the 19th century.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-textile-industry-in-england-come-from>Where did the textile industry in England come from?</h2>
<p>A large portion of England’s textile production went to China, India, Africa, and other parts of the world that had not begun to industrialize. England also needed to broaden its trade to ensure sources of cotton. English farmers could not grow cotton because of the cold climate, so it had to be imported from other countries.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-some-textile-designers-who-changed-the-world>Who are some textile designers who changed the world?</h2>
<p>The couple commissioned a number of leading artists such as Matisse and Henry Moore to design a collection of scarves, brightening up the drab wardrobes of Post War Britain. By 1946, they were applying fabrics to the international fashion industry and became renowned for their lively screen printed designs.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-britain-produce-half-the-worlds-cotton>When did Britain produce half the world’s cotton?</h2>
<p>By the middle of the 19th century, Britain was producing half the world’s cotton cloth, yet not a scrap of cotton was grown in Britain. A history of the British cotton industry is truly fascinating.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-textile-mill-in-america>Where was the first textile mill in America?</h2>
<p>In 1789, Samuel Slater memorized the secrets to textile manufacturing and brought them over to America to build the first water-powered cotton mill in America; being set up in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. With the growth of the concept of factories, England experienced a huge increase in textile production.</p>
