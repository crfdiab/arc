<h2 id=what-did-columbus-name-jamaica>What did Columbus name Jamaica?</h2>
<p>On this day on May 5th, 1494 Christopher Columbus “set foot” on Jamaica when he “claimed” it for Spain during his second voyage to the New World. The native Tainos called the island “Xaymaca”, the Spanish changed the name to “Jamaiqua” and eventually “Jamaica”’.</p>

<p>St. Ann’s Bay<br>
He landed on the island on 5 May 1494, during his second voyage to the Americas. Columbus returned to Jamaica during his fourth voyage to the Americas. He had been sailing around the Caribbean for nearly a year when a storm beached his ships in St. Ann’s Bay, Jamaica, on 25 June 1503.</p>
<h2 id=was-there-ever-slavery-in-jamaica>Was there ever slavery in Jamaica?</h2>
<p>The Jamaican slaves were bound (indentured) to their former owners’ service, albeit with a guarantee of rights, until 1838 under what was called the “Apprenticeship System”. With the abolition of the slave trade in 1808 and slavery itself in 1834, however, the island’s sugar- and slave-based economy faltered.</p>

<p>1655<br>
When the British captured Jamaica in 1655, the Spanish colonists fled, leaving a large number of African slaves. These former Spanish slaves created three Palenques, or settlements.</p>

<h2 id=when-did-christopher-columbus-sail-across-the-atlantic>When did Christopher Columbus sail across the Atlantic?</h2>
<p>The explorer Christopher Columbus made four trips across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain: in 1492, 1493, 1498 and 1502. He was determined to find a direct water route west from Europe to Asia, but he never did. Instead, he stumbled upon the Americas.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-discover-jamaica>Who was the first person to discover Jamaica?</h2>
<p>United Reggae offers an excerpt from Thibault Ehrengardt’s book The History of Jamaica from 1494 to 1838. C olumbus discovered Jamaica in 1494, during his second voyage, as related by his biography, written by his second son, Ferdinand.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-christopher-columbus-make-his-last-stop-on-his-voyage>Where did Christopher Columbus make his last stop on his voyage?</h2>
<p>On 13 January 1493, Columbus made his last stop of this voyage in the New World, in the Bay of Rincón at the eastern end of the Samaná Peninsula in northeast Hispaniola. There he encountered the warlike Cigüayos, the only natives who offered violent resistance during his first voyage to the Americas.</p>
