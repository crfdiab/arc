<h2 id=what-are-the-3-waste-excretion-structures-of-the-body>What are the 3 waste excretion structures of the body?</h2>
<p>Organs of excretion include the skin, liver, large intestine, lungs, and kidneys. All of them excrete wastes, and together they make up the excretory system .</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-main-excretory-waste-products>What are the 3 main excretory waste products?</h2>
<p>These are known as metabolism. These chemical reactions produce waste products such as carbon dioxide, water, salts, urea and uric acid. Accumulation of these wastes beyond a level inside the body is harmful to the body. The excretory organs remove these wastes.</p>
<h2 id=what-body-part-removes-liquid-waste>What body part removes liquid waste?</h2>
<p>kidneys<br>
The kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra make up the urinary system. They all work together to filter, store and remove liquid waste from your body.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-urine-stored>Where is urine stored?</h2>
<p>Once pee is produced, it travels from the kidney to the bladder, where it’s stored until you need to go to the bathroom. The bladder expands as it fills; when it’s full, nerve endings in the bladder wall send a message to the brain that you need to pee.</p>
<h2 id=what-removes-waste-from-the-body-that-can-become-toxic>What removes waste from the body that can become toxic?</h2>
<p>Body Waste: Urine In your body, the excretory system helps to keep salts and urea from building up to dangerous levels and becoming toxic. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that remove these toxins from your blood and produce urine to carry them from the body.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-excretory-materials-are-not-removed-from-your-body>What happens if excretory materials are not removed from your body?</h2>
<p>If these wastes are not removed, your cells can stop working, and you can get very sick. The organs of your excretory system help to release wastes from the body. The organs of the excretory system are also parts of other organ systems. For example, your lungs are part of the respiratory system.</p>
<h2 id=does-urine-and-sperm-come-from-the-same-hole>Does urine and sperm come from the same hole?</h2>
<p>As part of the reflex action, the opening that drains the bladder is closed. This means that urine is not released at the same time as semen.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-part-of-the-body-excretes-waste>Which is part of the body excretes waste?</h2>
<p>In addition to the kidneys, the liver, skin, and lungs also have important roles in the excretion of waste from the body. The lungs, liver, and skin are the main non- renal system organs involved in waste excretion.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-products-of-the-human-excretory-system>What are the products of the human excretory system?</h2>
<p>As a result, many waste products produced in our body are in various forms that include carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogenous products like urea, ammonia, and uric acid. In addition to these, the chemicals and other toxic compounds from medications and hormonal products are also produced.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-kidneys-involved-in-the-excretion-process>How are the kidneys involved in the excretion process?</h2>
<p>Kidneys are the vital organs which are involved in the excretion process. But there are also other organs which remove the waste from the body. All the above organs are involved in elimination. Elimination involves removal of waste from the body. Kidneys: These organs are located on the dorsal side of the body.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-responsible-for-the-elimination-of-waste-products>Which is responsible for the elimination of waste products?</h2>
<p>These other systems are responsible for the elimination of the waste products of the metabolism, as well as other liquid and gaseous wastes, but also provide other critical functions. The lungs: The lungs are responsible for the removal of gaseous waste from the body.</p>
