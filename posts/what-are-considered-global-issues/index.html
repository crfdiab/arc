<h2 id=what-are-considered-global-issues>What are considered global issues?</h2>
<p>Global environmental issues</p>
<ul>
<li>Overconsumption – situation where resource use has outpaced the sustainable capacity of the ecosystem.</li>
<li>Overpopulation – too many people for the planet to sustain.</li>
<li>Biodiversity loss.</li>
<li>Deforestation.</li>
<li>Desertification.</li>
<li>Global warming/climate change.</li>
<li>Habitat destruction.</li>
<li>Holocene extinction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-global-issue>What is the main global issue?</h2>
<p>Climate change is one of the major challenges of our time. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production, to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-example-of-a-global-social-issue>What is an example of a global social issue?</h2>
<p>Global social problems are those which cannot be confined within national boundaries and which need both national and international attention if they are to be ameliorated. Pollution of the atmosphere is a stark example of this process.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-of-global-issues>What are the causes of global issues?</h2>
<p>Global problems are the natural consequences of modern globalisation and unrestrained economic growth. They are the result of: irrational natural resource management; the expansive character of the current hydrocarbon-based economy; and the geopolitical standoff of superpowers possessing weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-the-word-global-issue>What is the meaning of the word global issue?</h2>
<p>Here are all the possible meanings and translations of the word global issue. Informally, a global issue is any issue that adversely affects the global community and environment, such as environmental issues, political crisis, social issues and economic crisis.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-most-important-issues-in-the-world>What are the most important issues in the world?</h2>
<p>Rather, it serves as an overview of some of the major issues all global citizens should be aware of. The UN has also set 17 goals to be achieved by 2030. These correspond with the most important issues of our time, and are known as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-environmental-issues-in-the-world>What are the major environmental issues in the world?</h2>
<p>Global environmental issues There are three major environmental issues listed by the UN. These include threats to habitats and organisms on land and underwater, as well as resource depletion. 1) Habitat and biodiversity loss</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-speak-on-global-issues>Do you have to speak on global issues?</h2>
<p>FOR THE IO YOU ARE REQUIRED TO SPEAK ON A GLOBAL ISSUE, NOT A GLOBAL AREA. Students might focus on the way in which texts explore aspects of family, class, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender and sexuality, and the way these impact on individuals and societies.</p>
