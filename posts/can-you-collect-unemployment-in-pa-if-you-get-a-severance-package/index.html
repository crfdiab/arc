<h2 id=can-you-collect-unemployment-in-pa-if-you-get-a-severance-package>Can you collect unemployment in PA if you get a severance package?</h2>
<p>In Pennsylvania, if you get severance pay, it may offset your unemployment insurance. Under Act 6 of 2011, workers who have severance pay, which is over 40% of the average annual wage in the state, will have their unemployment insurance offset according to a formula.</p>
<h2 id=does-severance-disqualify-you-from-unemployment>Does severance disqualify you from unemployment?</h2>
<p>Severance is often paid as a lump sum, though it can be paid out in installments as well. But again, the laws vary by state, and in some parts of the country, severance is not considered earned wages for unemployment purposes, which means it won’t stop you from collecting benefits.</p>
<h2 id=is-severance-pay-considered-wages-in-pennsylvania>Is severance pay considered wages in Pennsylvania?</h2>
<p>How does severance, separation or salary continuation pay affect my UC benefits? ​Severance pay received by a claimant that exceeds 40 percent of Pennsylvania’s average annual wage* is deducted from the claimant’s UC if the claimant’s application for benefits (AB) date is on or after Jan.</p>
<h2 id=should-i-accept-severance-package>Should I accept severance package?</h2>
<p>In most cases, employers are not required to provide employees with severance packages. There is no law in California requiring employers to offer severance packages. An employer is only obligated to give you severance pay if you have a previous agreement to receive it.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-collect-unemployment-if-you-get-severance-pay>Can you collect unemployment if you get severance pay?</h2>
<p>The good news is that you may be entitled to unemployment benefits even if you’re getting severance. But the specific rules around that vary from state to state. Will severance prevent you from collecting unemployment?</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-deductible-for-severance-in-pa>Is there a deductible for severance in PA?</h2>
<p>The deductible portion of your severance pay is allocated to the weeks immediately following your separation from employment, based on your full-time weekly wage. EXAMPLE: You received severance pay of $23,000. For Benefit Years that began in 2021, 40% of Pennsylvania’s average annual wage is $22,595.88.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-apply-for-unemployment-benefits-in-pa>How to apply for unemployment benefits in PA?</h2>
<p>You’ll also have to register for employment-search services at <a href=http://www.pacareerlink.pa.gov>www.pacareerlink.pa.gov</a> within 30 days after filing an application for benefits and actively seek work during each week that you claim UC benefits. Receiving UC benefits to which you are not entitled may result in reducing or removing future benefit entitlement until repaid.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-you-not-eligible-for-unemployment-in-pa>What makes you not eligible for unemployment in PA?</h2>
<p>However, if you engaged in “misconduct,” you will not be eligible to receive unemployment. In Pennsylvania, among other things, misconduct means an intentional violation of the employer’s rules, the failure to conform to standards which an employer can reasonably expect from an employee,…</p>
