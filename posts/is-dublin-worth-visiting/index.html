<h2 id=is-dublin-worth-visiting>Is Dublin worth visiting?</h2>
<p>It is worth visiting — not only for a pint with a view but for some background history on the city. Also, there are no tall buildings in the city center to get a really good view — except here. Come early and even better, book your ticket in advance and jump to the top.</p>
<h2 id=is-dublin-dangerous-for-tourists>Is Dublin dangerous for tourists?</h2>
<p>When speaking in general, Dublin is a very safe city. Certain petty crimes are possible, such as muggings, and robberies, which have been known to occur in Dublin. Be very careful while in Grafton Street, which is a place frequently visited by tourists and pickpockets as well.</p>
<h2 id=is-dublin-an-expensive-city-to-visit>Is Dublin an expensive city to visit?</h2>
<p>Ireland’s capital is the most expensive city in the euro area, primarily due to its staggering high rents. Dublin has been named as one of the most expensive places to live in Europe and has ranked as the number one most expensive city in the eurozone.</p>
<h2 id=is-dublin-a-good-area>Is Dublin a good area?</h2>
<p>In short, it’s a busy city packed with a diverse cast of people and places, and it’s full to the brim with residents from around the world. Whatever type of life you’re looking for, Dublin can give you it. No matter who you are and why you want to move to Dublin, we’ve got the perfect place for you to live.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-days-in-dublin-is-enough>How many days in Dublin is enough?</h2>
<p>Two days in Dublin is the perfect amount to get a taste of the city if you’re spending roughly 10 days to 2 weeks in Ireland. With only a week or so on the island, we’d recommend spending only one day in Dublin. With three weeks or more, you could consider dedicating more time to the city.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-a-meal-cost-in-dublin>How much does a meal cost in Dublin?</h2>
<p>While meal prices in Dublin can vary, the average cost of food in Dublin is €39 per day. Based on the spending habits of previous travelers, when dining out an average meal in Dublin should cost around €16 per person. Breakfast prices are usually a little cheaper than lunch or dinner.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-a-beer-cost-in-dublin>How much does a beer cost in Dublin?</h2>
<p>Cost of Living in Dublin</p>
<table><tr><th>Restaurants</th><th>Edit</th></tr><tr><td>Domestic Beer (1 pint draught)</td><td>5.50€</td></tr><tr><td>Imported Beer (12 oz small bottle)</td><td>5.75€</td></tr><tr><td>Cappuccino (regular)</td><td>3.41€</td></tr><tr><td>Coke/Pepsi (12 oz small bottle)</td><td>1.82€</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-visit-dublin-ireland>When is the best time to visit Dublin Ireland?</h2>
<p>The best time to visit Dublin is June through August when temperatures are warm (for Ireland anyway) and festivals fill the streets. This also constitutes the most expensive time to visit, with high hotel rates and airfare prices. It’s also the most crowded time of year.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-best-things-to-do-in-dublin-ireland>What are the best things to do in Dublin Ireland?</h2>
<p>Dublin is a beautiful, cultural city full of characters. There’s always craic to be had, and you’re never more than a stone’s throw away from nature. There are endless things to see, do and eat. But, of course, everything comes with a price, and no city is perfect.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-city-to-visit-in-ireland>Which is the best city to visit in Ireland?</h2>
<p>1 Derry 2 Doolin 3 Dublin City 4 Galway 5 Kilkenny 6 Kinsale 7 Ashford Castle 8 Belfast 9 Blarney Castle 10 Croagh Patrick</p>
<h2 id=why-is-dublin-known-as-a-tourist-destination>Why is Dublin known as a tourist destination?</h2>
<p>Dublin has, in fact, become a destination for mass tourism for a few years now but is usually seen as a city where you pass by before moving into the countryside (which is actually AMAZING!) or it is experienced only for its nightlife, among the most “interesting” in Europe.</p>
