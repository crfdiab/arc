<h2 id=why-was-gold-valuable-in-ancient-times>Why was gold valuable in ancient times?</h2>
<p>In most ancient cultures gold was popular in jewellery and art because of its value, aesthetic qualities, ductility and malleability. The value and beauty of gold made it an ideal material for particularly important political and religious objects.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-gold-originally-used-for>What was gold originally used for?</h2>
<p>Gold was generally used for a couple thousand years solely to create things such as jewelry and idols for worship. This was until around 1500 BC when the ancient empire of Egypt, which benefited greatly from its gold-bearing region, Nubia, made gold the first official medium of exchange for international trade.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-gold-get-its-value>Where does gold get its value?</h2>
<p>The value of gold goes up because the demand for it goes up, while the supply has been basically static (or growing at a low static rate) for a long time. The demand is going up because people see it as a safe place to put their money.</p>
<h2 id=do-we-need-gold>Do we need gold?</h2>
<p>Gold is one of the most highly-desired and useful metals in the world. Today, gold still occupies an important place in our culture and society – we use it to make our most prized objects: wedding rings, Olympic medals, money, jewellery, Oscars, Grammys, crucifixes, art and many more.</p>
<h2 id=is-diamond-rarer-than-gold>Is Diamond rarer than gold?</h2>
<p>But, in its elemental form, gold is significantly rarer than diamonds, Faul told Live Science. Gold is more abundant than large diamonds, but diamonds as a class of material are not particularly rare.</p>
<h2 id=is-gold-worth-its-value>Is gold worth its value?</h2>
<p>Although the price of gold can be volatile in the short term, it has always maintained its value over the long term. Through the years, it has served as a hedge against inflation and the erosion of major currencies, and thus is an investment well worth considering.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-europeans-search-for-gold-and-glory>Why did the Europeans search for gold and Glory?</h2>
<p>It is generally said that there were three main motives for European exploration. These motivations were said to be “God, gold, and glory.” When we say that “God” was one of the motivations, we mean that the Europeans said that they wanted to spread the word of God around the world. The Europeans wanted to become rich.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-gold-so-important-to-the-explorers>Why was gold so important to the explorers?</h2>
<p>Ferdinand Magellan He searched for a passage to the Pacific Ocean because he wanted his crew to be the first to circumnavigate the world. Why was gold important to explorers? Gold: Rumors of gold made explorers believe they could get rich quickly.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-a-goal-of-the-first-european-explorers>What was a goal of the first European explorers?</h2>
<p>Explorers wanted to gain the fame that went with finding important new lands or important routes to known lands. The rulers who sent those explorers out to explore wanted the glory of having new lands that they could claim as their own. A final goal (in my view, the most important), was to get rich.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-so-much-talk-of-gold>Why was there so much talk of gold?</h2>
<p>Gold: Rumors of gold made explorers believe they could get rich quickly. They believed the pay off would be huge. If an explorer found new land, he was paid in gold and riches by the King and Queen of his country.</p>
