<p>On January 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. With it, he freed all slaves in Confederate or contested areas of the South. However, the Proclamation did not include slaves in non-Confederate border states and in parts of the Confederacy under Union control.</p>

<p>The issues on the minds of Americans in 1860 were varied, with some still in the political arena today. Political debate covered: The preservation of the Union. The rights of States. The construction of a transcontinental railroad.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-slave-states-get-more-electoral-votes>Why did slave states get more electoral votes?</h2>
<p>Slave states counted 3/5 of their enslaved population when determining the number of electoral votes. This meant more votes for the state even though the opinions of these people were not represented. In a state like Virginia, where 1/3 of the population was enslaved, this was a big deal.</p>
