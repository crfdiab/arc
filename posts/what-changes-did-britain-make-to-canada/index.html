<h2 id=what-changes-did-britain-make-to-canada>What changes did Britain make to Canada?</h2>
<p>An age of British rule Now England controlled all of Canada. In the years that followed, Canadian colonies—now under British rule—expanded their trade networks and built an economy largely supported by agriculture and the export of natural resources like fur and timber.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-canadas-relationship-to-england>What is Canada’s relationship to England?</h2>
<p>Canada and the UK share a sovereign, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and are among the oldest parliamentary democracies in the world. The relationship between our two countries continues a long tradition of strategic partnership.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-canada-important-to-the-british-empire>Why was Canada important to the British Empire?</h2>
<p>Canada’s timber and shipbuilding industries were important. So were naval bases like the one at Halifax in Nova Scotia. The British learnt the lesson of 1776 and generally gave in to the settlers on the question of letting them rule themselves.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-britain-grant-the-province-of-canada-as-a-result>What did Britain grant the province of Canada as a result?</h2>
<p>With the addition of Canada to the British Empire, Britain gained control of a strip of territory along the St. Lawrence River with a population of at least 70,000 francophone Roman Catholics, which was expanded and renamed as the Province of Quebec under the Quebec Act.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-queens-representative-in-canada-2020>Who is the Queen’s representative in Canada 2020?</h2>
<p>The governor general of Canada (French: Gouverneure générale du Canada) is the federal viceregal representative of the Canadian monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
<h2 id=does-canada-report-to-the-queen>Does Canada report to the Queen?</h2>
<p>The Monarchy’s Political Role in Canada On the one hand, the Queen doesn’t do much. Formally, Queen Elizabeth II is described as being Canada’s head of state — a symbolic figure of political authority — but the prime minister is called the head of government — the actual ruler of the country.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-canada-like-before-colonization>What was Canada like before colonization?</h2>
<p>Prior to European colonization, the lands encompassing present-day Canada were inhabited for millennia by Indigenous peoples, with distinct trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social organization.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-not-go-to-war-with-canada>Why did the British not go to war with Canada?</h2>
<p>Royal Navy officers generally believed that if war did occur, they could transport an army to Canada if asked, but nonetheless saw it as impossible to defend Canada against the much larger United States, so did not plan to do so, as Canada’s loss would not be fatal to Britain.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-nova-scotia-and-new-brunswick-join-canada>When did Nova Scotia and New Brunswick join Canada?</h2>
<p>The three Maritime provinces entered Confederation during the 19th century (New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were founding members of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, and Prince Edward Island joined in 1873).</p>
<h2 id=which-is-part-of-canada-is-on-the-atlantic-coast>Which is part of Canada is on the Atlantic Coast?</h2>
<p>Although Quebec has a physical Atlantic coast on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, it is generally not considered an Atlantic Province, instead being classified as part of Central Canada along with Ontario. Atlantic and Central Canada together are also known as Eastern Canada.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-battle-of-the-atlantic-important-to-canada>Why was the Battle of the Atlantic important to Canada?</h2>
<p>This 7-year naval battle of the Second World War (WW2) was Canada’s biggest military campaign ever. The war against the U-boats from 1939 to 1945 was the formative experience for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) in the twentieth century.</p>
