<h2 id=what-indian-chief-killed-general-custer>What Indian chief killed General Custer?</h2>
<p>White Bull<br>
George Custer’s entire direct command wiped out by Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors, exactly 144 years ago today. At the conclusion of the ceremony, an old Lakota warrior named White Bull stepped forward and handed his tomahawk to retired Gen. Edward Godfrey, who had served as a lieutenant in the battle.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-custer-lose>How did Custer lose?</h2>
<p>Custer was defeated at the Battle of the Little Bighorn because he made a lot of fundamental errors. He acted alone – even though Gibbon’s last words to him were – Custer, don’t be greedy. Wait for us. Instead of going round the Wolf Mountains, Custer force-marched his men through the mountains.</p>
<h2 id=who-fought-at-little-bighorn>Who fought at Little Bighorn?</h2>
<p>The Battle of the Little Bighorn was fought along the ridges, steep bluffs, and ravines of the Little Bighorn River, in south-central Montana on June 25-26, 1876. The combatants were warriors of the Lakota Sioux, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes, battling men of the 7th Regiment of the US Cavalry.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-chief-of-the-lakota-tribe-that-defeated-custer>Who was the chief of the Lakota tribe that defeated Custer?</h2>
<p>Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. Sitting Bull, chief of the Lakota tribe that defeated Custer at Little Bighorn, had fought multiple battles against American soldiers by the time he led his tribe against Custer, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-custer-want-to-be-an-indian-fighter>Why did Custer want to be an Indian fighter?</h2>
<p>Custer was optimistic that the assignment would give him a chance to improve his reputation as an Indian fighter. Initially, the military escort saw little action. The hostile Indians seemed to be avoiding or ignoring the survey party. For Custer, the mission turned into something of a lark.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-in-charge-of-the-army-at-custers-last-stand>Who was in charge of the army at Custer’s last stand?</h2>
<p>The U.S. Army dispatched three columns of soldiers, including Custer and his 7th Cavalry, to round up the Indians and return them to their reservations. The plan was for Custer’s cavalry and Brigadier General Alfred Terry’s infantry to rendezvous with troops under the command of Colonel John Gibbon and Brigadier General George Crook.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-custer-win-the-battle-of-little-bighorn>When did Custer win the Battle of Little Bighorn?</h2>
<p>At the 10-year memorial of the Battle of Little Bighorn, unidentified Lakota Sioux dance in commemoration of their victory over teh United States 7th Cavalry Regiment (under General George Custer), Montana, 1886.</p>
