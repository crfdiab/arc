<h2 id=how-long-did-the-french-occupy-algeria>How long did the French occupy Algeria?</h2>
<p>While the administration of Algeria changed significantly over the 132 years of French rule, the Mediterranean coastal region of Algeria, housing the vast majority of its population, was ruled as an integral part of France from 1848 until its independence.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-france-colonize-algeria>When did France colonize Algeria?</h2>
<p>1830<br>
The French invaded Algeria in 1830. This was the first colonisation of an Arab country since the days of the Crusades and it came as a great shock to the Arab nation.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-france-occupy-algeria>Why did France occupy Algeria?</h2>
<p>The conquest of Algeria began in the last days of the Bourbon Restoration by Charles X of France. It aimed to put a definite end to Barbary privateering and increase the king’s popularity among the French people, particularly in Paris, where many veterans of the Napoleonic Wars lived.</p>
<h2 id=was-algeria-colonized-by-the-french>Was Algeria colonized by the French?</h2>
<p>In the year 1830, Algeria was colonized by the French, leading to over a century of exploitation.</p>
<h2 id=do-french-still-live-in-algeria>Do French still live in Algeria?</h2>
<p>After Algeria became independent in 1962, about 800,000 Pieds-Noirs of French nationality were evacuated to mainland France, while about 200,000 remained in Algeria. In popular culture, the community is often represented as feeling removed from French culture while longing for Algeria.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-islam-have-to-do-with-algerian-french-tensions>What did Islam have to do with Algerian French tensions?</h2>
<p>While in Islam, a Muslim society subject to non-Muslim rulers is acceptable (see Qur’an), the discrimination against Islam led it to be a strong element of the resistance movement to the French in the Algerian War of Independence.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-algeria-like-before-colonization>What was Algeria like before colonization?</h2>
<p>Before the arrival of the French in 1830, Algeria was known as the Barbary Coast (a corruption of Berber) and was notorious for the pirates who preyed on Christian shipping. They were followed by the Romans (98 through 117 A.D.), who annexed Berber territory to the Roman Empire.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-french-take-control-of-algeria>When did the French take control of Algeria?</h2>
<p>In 1827, an argument between Hussein Dey, the ruler of the Ottoman Regency of Algiers, and the French consul escalated into a naval blockade, following which France invaded and quickly seized Algiers in 1830, and rapidly took control of other coastal communities.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-france-blockade-algiers-for-three-years>Why did France blockade Algiers for three years?</h2>
<p>The French monarch sought to reverse his domestic unpopularity. As a result of what the French considered an insult to the French consul in Algiers by the dey in 1827, France blockaded Algiers for three years. France used the failure of the blockade as a reason for a military expedition against Algiers in 1830.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-ottoman-empire-take-over-algeria>When did the Ottoman Empire take over Algeria?</h2>
<p>Background information. The territory now known as Algeria was only partially under the Ottoman Empire ‘s control in 1830. The dey ruled the entire Regency of Algiers, but only exercised direct control in and around Algiers, with Beyliks established in a few outlying areas, including Oran and Constantine.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-battle-of-algiers>Who was involved in the Battle of Algiers?</h2>
<p>To face the French, the dey sent 7,000 janissaries, 19,000 troops from the beys of Constantine and Oran, and about 17,000 Kabyles. The French established a strong beachhead and pushed toward Algiers, thanks in part to superior artillery and better organization.</p>
