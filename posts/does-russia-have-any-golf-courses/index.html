<h2 id=does-russia-have-any-golf-courses>Does Russia have any golf courses?</h2>
<p>Now there are 32 golf courses in Russia. The distinctive feature of Russian courses is that most of them are the work of the best world architects, they are perfectly manicured and harmoniously match the rich nature of Russia.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-murmansk-russia-known-for>What is Murmansk Russia known for?</h2>
<p>In World War II Murmansk served as the main port for Anglo-American convoys carrying war supplies to the U.S.S.R. through the Arctic Ocean. The town is now an important fishing port, and its fish-processing plant is one of the largest in Europe.</p>

<h2 id=why-is-there-no-golf-in-russia>Why is there no golf in Russia?</h2>

<h2 id=when-does-it-get-dark-in-murmansk-russia>When does it get dark in Murmansk Russia?</h2>
<p>For the people of the Murmansk region, in December and January, this is what midday looks like.
