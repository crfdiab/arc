<h2 id=why-is-egypt-important-to-africa>Why is Egypt important to Africa?</h2>
<p>Egypt is a major power in Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Islamic world. Egypt’s ancient civilization is well known and produced famous monuments like the Great Sphinx and the Giza pyramids. Archaeologists study ancient ruins such as Memphis, Thebes, the Valley of the Kings, and Karnak.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-egypt-connected-to-africa>How is Egypt connected to Africa?</h2>
<p>Formally, the Suez Canal (which runs through Egypt) is the dividing line between Asia and Africa. The majority of the country is on the other side, in Africa, with a land bridge connecting the mainland of Egypt to the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-egypt-taken-out-of-africa>Why was Egypt taken out of Africa?</h2>
<p>The removal of Egypt from Africa serves a twofold purpose. First, it leads to the obvious idea that Egypt is not a part of Africa; therefore, its population could not have been Black. Secondly, it serves the purpose of implying that civilization did not begin with the Black race.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-egypt-important-in-world-history>Why is Egypt important in world history?</h2>
<p>Ancient Egypt was one of the greatest and most powerful civilizations in the history of the world. It lasted for over 3000 years from 3150 BC to 30 BC. The civilization of Ancient Egypt was located along the Nile River in northeast Africa. The Nile provided food, soil, water, and transportation for the Egyptians.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-africans-in-egypt>Why are there so many Africans in Egypt?</h2>
<p>Therefore, Egyptians are Africans. But it wasn’t simply a matter of geographical location-the issue turned out to be much more complex than that. I did not know it at the time but I was to be most astonished at what I would soon discover.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-black-land-important-to-ancient-egypt>Why was the black land important to ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Their sun god, the falcon-headed Re, did not cross the heavens in a flaming chariot, he sailed sedately in a solar boat. Parallel to the Nile on both banks of the river runs the Black Land – the narrow strip of fertile soil that allowed the Egyptians to practice the most efficient agriculture in the ancient world.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-ancient-egypt-important-to-the-modern-world>Why was ancient Egypt important to the modern world?</h2>
<p>So far we have considered a series of worthy reasons why ancient Egypt is important to the modern world. Egypt offers inspiration, stimulation, valuable knowledge and an insight into our own modern culture. One very important reason, however, has been overlooked.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-river-nile-important-to-the-ancient-egyptians>Why was the river Nile important to the ancient Egyptians?</h2>
<p>The River Nile flows northwards through the centre of Egypt, bringing much needed water to an otherwise arid part of north-east Africa. This wealth of objects, of course, creates a highly biased collection of artefacts.</p>
