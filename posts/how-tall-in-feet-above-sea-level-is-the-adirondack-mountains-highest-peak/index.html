<p>5,344 feet<br>
Mount Marcy, peak in the Adirondack Mountains and the highest point in New York, U.S., reaching an elevation of 5,344 feet (1,629 metres) above sea level. It lies in west-central Essex county in the northeastern part of the state, about 12 miles (19 km) south-southeast of Lake Placid village.</p>

<p>The Adirondacks – the product of this lengthy process – are a unique mountain range. They are not part of the Catskills or Appalachian Mountains. They are new mountains, although made of old rocks, and are still growing, faster than erosion is wearing the surface away.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-easiest-high-peak-to-climb>What is the easiest high peak to climb?</h2>
<p>Pico de Orizaba, in Mexico. Sometimes called “the world’s easiest 20,000-foot peak,” Island Peak is the most popular “trekking peak” in Nepal — summits classified as attainable by climbers with some mountaineering experience.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-mt-marcy>How old is Mt Marcy?</h2>
<p>Marcy, the 19th-century Governor of New York, who authorized the environmental survey that explored the area. Its first recorded ascent was on August 5, 1837, by a large party led by Ebenezer Emmons looking for the source of the East Fork of the Hudson River. Today the summit may be reached by multiple trails.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-are-the-high-peaks-in-adirondack>How tall are the high peaks in Adirondack?</h2>
<p>While Adirondack State Park has hundreds of mountains, the High Peaks stand out as it is home to 46 mountains over 4000 feet in altitude. To be honest, this is a little misleading as the list was compiled over a hundred years ago and modern survey techniques have found a few are just under.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-macnaughton-mountain-in-the-adirondack>How tall is MacNaughton Mountain in the Adirondack?</h2>
<p>Those who have climbed all 46 High Peaks are eligible to join the Adirondack Forty-Sixers club. Some surveys list MacNaughton Mountain at 4,000 feet (1,219 m), and some argue that it should be included in the High Peaks. However, more recent surveys list the mountain at 3,983 feet (1,214 m).</p>

<p>The region is made up of hundreds of peaks and foothills, with more than 40 summits higher than 4,000 feet (1,200 metres); the tallest are Mount Marcy, which is the highest point in the state at 5,344 feet (1,629 metres), and Algonquin Peak of Mount McIntyre at 5,114 feet (1,559 metres).</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-adirondack-park-in-new-york>How big is the Adirondack Park in New York?</h2>
<p>In 1892 the New York state legislature created Adirondack Park, which has grown over the years and is roughly coterminous with the Adirondacks region, making it the largest American state or national park outside of Alaska. The park covers almost one-fifth of the state and is about the size of Vermont.</p>
