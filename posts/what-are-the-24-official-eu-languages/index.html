<h2 id=how-many-official-languages-are-there-in-europe>How many official languages are there in Europe?</h2>
<p>English! There are 24 official languages in the European Union. In alphabetical order, they are… (Take a deep breath here.) Whew, what a mouthful! And that doesn’t even include the official languages of European countries that aren’t in the EU.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-second-most-spoken-language-in-europe>Which is the second most spoken language in Europe?</h2>

<p>The continent of Europe is made up of 45 different countries and covers an area of 3,930,000 square miles (10,180,000 sq km). As such, it is a highly diverse place with many different cuisines, cultures, and languages.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-minority-languages-in-the-eu>Are there any minority languages in the EU?</h2>
<p>By contrast, there are many minority languages spoken by groups in countries throughout the EU. While these minority languages are important to those groups, they are not official and working languages of the governments of those countries; thus, they are not official languages of the EU.</p>
