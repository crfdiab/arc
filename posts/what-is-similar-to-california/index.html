<p>Top 5 States Most Similar to California</p>
<ul>
<li>Washington is another mountainous state on the Pacific Coast.</li>
<li>Oregon is very similar to Washington.</li>
<li>Nevada borders California to the west.</li>
<li>Arizona is another landlocked state that borders California to its west.</li>
<li>Colorado is more east than the other states on this list.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=which-state-is-similar-to-california>Which state is similar to California?</h2>
<p>California is bordered by three states: Arizona, Nevada and Oregon. If you’re in San Diego you see that Arizona is closest. If you’re in Sacramento you can see that Nevada is closest. If you’re at the northern end of the state you will think of Oregon as the closest.</p>
<h2 id=what-living-in-california-is-like>What Living in California is like?</h2>
<p>By many metrics, the cost of living in California is consistently among the highest in the nation, especially in desirable areas like San Francisco and Los Angeles. It’s very difficult to find a cheap place to live here. The median home value is $539,800, which is the second-highest countrywide—only Hawaii beats it.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-has-a-climate-like-california>What country has a climate like California?</h2>
<p>This was no coincidence. Spain, in the Mediterranean Basin, is California’s climate cousin. On every continent except Antarctica, the west coasts share a similar climate, called the Mediterranean climate. It is characterized by warm to hot summers with basically no rainfall, and winters that are short, mild, and wet.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-is-most-like-california>Which country is most like California?</h2>
<p>California is very similar to parts of Chile and Morroco, climate wise. Culturally, I would try to match California with something like the Vancouver area. However, all together, I would say somewhere in the northeast of Spain. Valencia, Zaragoza, and Barcelona are all okay matches.</p>
<h2 id=which-climate-is-best>Which climate is best?</h2>
<p>10 Countries With A Perfect Climate And Low Cost Of Living</p>
<ul>
<li>Mexico. Like any country, some parts of Mexico are nicer and safer than others.</li>
<li>Panama. Just a bit further south is Panama.</li>
<li>Ecuador. Situated on the equator, Ecuador is a top pick if you really desire warm weather.</li>
<li>Colombia.</li>
<li>Costa Rica.</li>
<li>Malaysia.</li>
<li>Spain.</li>
<li>Nicaragua.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-climate-does-california-live-in>What kind of climate does California live in?</h2>
<p>Summers are very warm, with cool evenings, while the spring and autumn months are mild, with cool evenings. The winter ‘rainy season’ is gentle and occurs between January and March. Much of the state has a Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-geography-is-found-in-california>What kind of geography is found in California?</h2>
<p>Northern California is more rugged and natural, with vineyards, mountains, and agricultural regions. California is bordered to the north by Oregon state, to the east by the states of Nevada and Arizona across the Colorado River, to the south by Mexico, and to the west by the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-northern-and-southern-california>What’s the difference between northern and Southern California?</h2>
<p>Southern California is generally a developed urban environment, with major cities and sprawling suburbs accessible only by car. Northern California is more rugged and natural, with vineyards, mountains, and agricultural regions.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-san-francisco-and-los-angeles>What’s the difference between San Francisco and Los Angeles?</h2>
<p>San Francisco is a northern city, while San Diego and Los Angeles are southern, but the areas in between aren’t easily defined – rather, the distinction is more between the differing attitudes and lifestyles in different areas, than a physical boundary.</p>
