<h2 id=why-is-oxygen-so-important-to-life-on-earth>Why is oxygen so important to life on Earth?</h2>
<p>Most living things need oxygen to survive. Oxygen helps organisms grow, reproduce, and turn food into energy. Humans get the oxygen they need by breathing through their nose and mouth into their lungs. Oxygen gives our cells the ability to break down food in order to get the energy we need to survive.</p>
<h2 id=what-role-does-oxygen-play-in-food-webs>What role does oxygen play in food webs?</h2>
<p>Consumers, in general, are aerobic creatures that must breathe oxygen to sustain the cellular reactions that release the energy contained in food molecules. These reactions then generate carbon dioxide as a waste product.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-oxygen-so-important-to-humans>Why is oxygen so important to humans?</h2>
<p>Our body needs oxygen to obtain energy to fuel all our living processes. Carbon dioxide is a waste product of that process. The respiratory system, with its conduction and respiratory zones, brings air from the environment to the lungs and facilitates gas exchange both in the lungs and within the cells.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-oxygen-affect-the-environment>How does oxygen affect the environment?</h2>
<p>“Oxygen affects climate because it makes up a large fraction of the atmosphere’s mass. Reducing oxygen levels thins the atmosphere, allowing more sunlight to reach Earth’s surface.” As water vapour is a greenhouse gas, this makes the Earth warmer.</p>
<h2 id=what-products-are-made-from-oxygen>What products are made from oxygen?</h2>
<p>Oxygen compounds</p>
<ul>
<li>Water (H2O) is the most familiar oxygen compound.</li>
<li>Oxides, such as iron oxide or rust, Fe.</li>
<li>Quartz is a common crystalline mineral made of silica, or silicon dioxide (SiO.</li>
<li>Acetone is an important feeder material in the chemical industry.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-oxygen-is-created>How oxygen is created?</h2>
<p>Oxygen is generated during photosynthesis by plants and many types of microbes. Plants both use oxygen (during respiration) and produce it (via photosynthesis). Oxygen can also form a molecule of three atoms, which is known as ozone (O3).</p>
<h2 id=where-does-oxygen-come-from-in-an-ecosystem>Where does oxygen come from in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Oxygen is an essential and pervasive element in virtually all biological environments. Most ecosystems contain aerobic microbes and animals that require atmospheric oxygen for respiration, and even exotic ecosystems dominated by anaerobic bacteria include oxygen as an atomic component of molecules such as carbon dioxide, nitrate and water.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-oxygen-important-in-aerobic-respiration>How is oxygen important in aerobic respiration?</h2>
<p>Oxygen is the only molecules to grab the reactive electron from NADH or FADH2 via hydrogen transporter molecules and become water..that is why glucose reaction creates CO2 and H20(water)</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-oxygen-to-living-things>What is the importance of oxygen to living things?</h2>
<p>Besides the most valuable energy resources is in electron transport which creates up to 28 ATP-32 ATP. What is the importance of oxygen to living things? Oxygen is the key for generating energy in cellular respiration.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-marine-organisms-need-oxygen-to-breathe>Why do marine organisms need oxygen to breathe?</h2>
<p>It is not only marine fish, microorganisms also require oxygen to breathe. Microorganisms play a role in breaking down toxic chemicals into simple and less toxic compounds. All marine organisms need the oxygen as well as possible. There are such of factors that contain the dissolved oxygen that explained above.</p>
