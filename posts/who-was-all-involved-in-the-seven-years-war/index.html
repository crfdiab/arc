<h2 id=who-were-the-two-major-forces-battling-it-out-in-north-america>Who were the two major forces battling it out in North America?</h2>
<p>The French and Indian War was part of a worldwide nine years’ war that took place between 1754 and 1763. It was fought between France and Great Britain to determine control of the vast colonial territory of North America.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-empires-fought-over-control-of-america-before-the-english-were-involved>What two empires fought over control of America before the English were involved?</h2>
<p>French & Indian Wars. The French and Indian War was part of the Seven Years War waged between France and England. They fought for control of North America and the rich fur trade.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-spain-not-join-the-allies-in-world-war-2>Why did Spain not join the Allies in World War 2?</h2>
<p>The Spanish policy frustrated Axis proposals that would have encouraged Franco to take British -controlled Gibraltar. Much of the reason for Spanish reluctance to join the war was due to Spain’s reliance on imports from the United States.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-spain-not-allowed-to-join-the-united-nations>Why was Spain not allowed to join the United Nations?</h2>
<p>After the war Spain was not allowed to join the newly created United Nations because of the wartime support for the Axis and it would be isolated by many other countries until the mid-1950s.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-spanish-lose-control-of-the-americas>When did the Spanish lose control of the Americas?</h2>
<p>In the early 19th century, the Spanish American wars of independence resulted in the secession and subsequent division of most Spanish territories in the Americas, except for Cuba and Puerto Rico, which were lost to The United States in 1898, following the Spanish–American War. The loss of these territories ended Spanish rule in the Americas.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-spain-endorse-the-american-revolution>How did Spain endorse the American Revolution?</h2>
<p>As the ally of the United States’ ally, Spain managed to endorse the revolt at a critical diplomatic distance. The American Revolution had already spawned a world war between the two international powers of Britain and France.</p>
