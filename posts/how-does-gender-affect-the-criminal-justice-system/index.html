<h2 id=how-does-gender-affect-the-criminal-justice-system>How does gender affect the criminal justice system?</h2>
<p>Gender-based discrimination in the criminal justice system creates significant obstacles to achieve access to justice for all. This problem disproportionately affects women, who face still face significant barriers in accessing justice, whether they are victims, witnesses, alleged offenders or prisoners.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-south-africa-deal-with-gender-based-violence>How does South Africa deal with gender-based violence?</h2>
<p>6 Ways to Support a Survivor of Gender-Based Violence You can contact the GBVCC on 0800 428 428 from anywhere in South Africa, or use their “Please Call Me” option to get them to call you back by dialling *120*7867# on your cell phone.</p>
<h2 id=does-gender-play-a-role-in-who-gets-probation>Does gender play a role in who gets probation?</h2>
<p>A majority of women convicted of crimes are sentenced to probation. Although proportionately more women than men receive probation, little is known about female probationers. A number of gender differences were identified across the probationer, sentencing and case outcome variables examined.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-gender-bias-in-our-court-system>Is there a gender bias in our court system?</h2>
<p>Some researchers assert that women are treated -chivalrously” by the legal system. They point to studies indicating that women are held in’custody less often than men, receive fewer convictions, and are given lighter sentences. Other researchers hold that women are at a disadvantage in the legal system.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-gender-based-violence-south-africa>What is gender-based violence South Africa?</h2>
<p>GBV is a term used to describe violence directed at an individual based on their gender. This violence includes verbal, emotional, sexual, physical, and psychological abuse. Although both men and women experience GBV, the statistics in South Africa show that most of the victims are women and girls.</p>
<h2 id=does-gender-play-a-role-in-sentencing>Does gender play a role in sentencing?</h2>
<p>The findings of the current study show that gender continues to influence the sentencing process in U.S. federal courts despite guidelines designed to avoid differential sentencing.</p>
<h2 id=do-judges-gender-affect-the-sentencing-of-criminal-defendants>Do judges gender affect the sentencing of criminal defendants?</h2>
<p>They find that the effects of judge’s gender on sentencing outcomes are small or negligible but that, where differences do exist, female judges are harsher. Also, there is little evidence that male and female judges sentence female defendants differently.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-gender-bias-mean>What does gender bias mean?</h2>
<p>Gender bias is behavior that shows favoritism toward one gender over another. Most often, gender bias is the act of favoring men and/or boys over women and/or girls. However, this is not always the case. In order to define gender bias completely, we first must make a distinction between the terms gender and sex.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-rapists-are-men>What percentage of rapists are men?</h2>
<p>Men and Boys Are Also Affected by Sexual Violence As of 1998, 2.78 million men in the U.S. had been victims of attempted or completed rape. About 3% of American men—or 1 in 33—have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. 1 out of every 10 rape victims are male.</p>
