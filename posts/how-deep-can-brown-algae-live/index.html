<h2 id=how-deep-can-brown-algae-live>How deep can brown algae live?</h2>
<p>Several species, however, grow very large (as much as 45 m in length). These “giant kelps” contain gas-filled structures that allow them to produce a floating canopy that extends to the surface in water depths as great as 30 m.</p>
<h2 id=do-brown-algae-live-in-deep-water>Do brown algae live in deep water?</h2>
<p>Brown algae are generally khaki-brown in colour, due to the possession of green pigments (chlorophyll a and c) and the brown fucoxanthin. The different pigments absorb different coloured light and this is very important for seaweeds that live in deeper water.</p>
<h2 id=how-deep-can-algae-grow-in-the-ocean>How deep can algae grow in the ocean?</h2>
<p>Deep Sea Dweller Most varieties of algae live near the surface of the water in order to get enough sunlight to live. Since they can absorb blue light, red algae can live in much deeper water where light of long wavelengths — like red — can’t reach. Red algae have been found living in depths of over 500 feet.</p>
<h2 id=which-algae-can-survive-in-deep-ocean>Which algae can survive in deep ocean?</h2>
<p>Red algae<br>
So, the correct answer is ‘Red algae’.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-deepest-dwelling-algae-red-green-or-brown-why>Which is the deepest dwelling algae red green or brown Why?</h2>
<p>Among the green. red and brown algae Red Algae is likely to be found in deepest water because of a pigment present in them which is called phycoerythrin due to which it is able to absorb light of blue color and reflects red color.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-fun-fact-about-brown-algae>What is a fun fact about brown algae?</h2>
<p>Among the brown algae are the largest and most complex of the algae; well-known forms include the giant kelp and the free-floating sargassum weed. Algae have chlorophyll and can manufacture their own food through the process of photosynthesis. Kelps are the largest algaes. They can be more than 200 feet.</p>
<h2 id=why-can-red-algae-live-so-deep-in-the-ocean>Why can Red Algae live so deep in the ocean?</h2>
<p>They also can survive at greater depths in the ocean than some other algae, because the phycoerythrin’s absorption of blue light waves, which penetrate deeper than other light waves do, allows red algae to carry out photosynthesis at a greater depth.</p>
<h2 id=are-algae-found-in-deep-sea>Are algae found in deep sea?</h2>
<p>Weʻre learning about algae that grows in deep sea environments, called mesophotic reefs. Beyond the reach of conventional scuba, mesophotic reefs receive just enough sunlight for algae to grow and photosynthesize. Deep sea corals, other invertebrates, and fishes also inhabit these remote environments.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-likely-to-be-found-in-the-deepest-waters>Which is likely to be found in the deepest waters?</h2>
<p>Explanation: Red algae is mostly likely to be found in deep water. This has to do with the different wavelengths of light and how deep they can penetrate water. Red light has the longest wavelength of the visible spectrum which means it penetrates water the least.</p>
<h2 id=why-can-red-algae-live-so-deep-in-the-ocean-1>Why can red algae live so deep in the ocean?</h2>
<h2 id=where-does-red-marine-algae-live-in-the-ocean>Where does red marine algae live in the ocean?</h2>
<p>Red marine algae, another kind of marine algae species, prefers to grow in low-tide terrace and subtidal zone. Some lives in 30-60 meters below clear underwater and shady rocks in intertidal zone; Some other lives in rocks espoused on huge waves. More interestingly, red marine algae are of high economic value.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-algae-are-found-in-the-atlantic-ocean>What kind of algae are found in the Atlantic Ocean?</h2>
<p>Another brown algae which commonly known is fucus (rock weeds), or sargassum which known as frominent species in the sargasso sea and its located at North Atlantic Ocean. Brown algae commonly eaten by herbivorous organism such as fish, gastropod, and sea urchins.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-brown-algae-important-to-the-environment>Why is brown algae important to the environment?</h2>
<p>The capacity of brown algae is to strengthen the stomach, restore the appetite for sickness and also to treat constipation. Moreover, the substances contained in brown algae also can be utilized as blood anticoagulant, antihelmintic drug.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-algae-looks-like-a-stag>What kind of algae looks like a stag?</h2>
<p>Staghorn algae, which looks like stag, is one of brown algae and can be edible. It is widely distributed in the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and often attached on the rocks beaten by waves. However, the king of algae is kelp which reaches 200 meters long.</p>
