<h2 id=what-beach-is-closest-to-san-juan-airport>What beach is closest to San Juan airport?</h2>
<p>Condado Beaches<br>
Condado Beaches Just a 15-minute ride from the San Juan Airport you can spend a relaxing day enjoying the beaches of Condado, easily accessible along Ashford Drive.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-is-the-beach-from-san-juan-puerto-rico-airport>How far is the beach from San Juan Puerto Rico airport?</h2>
<p>The distance between San Juan Airport (SJU) and Ocean Park Beach is 5 km.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-are-the-beaches-from-san-juan-puerto-rico>How far are the beaches from San Juan Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>Just 30 miles east of San Juan, Luquillo Beach is one of the prettiest on Puerto Rico itself. The long crescent-shaped stretch of golden-kissed sand is lined with swaying coconut palms and backed by a usually calm stretch of turquoise sea that is great for swimming-there are lifeguards on duty during the day.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-beach-near-san-juan>What is the best beach near San Juan?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-the-prettiest-beach-in-san-juan-puerto-rico>What is the prettiest beach in San Juan Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>El Escambrón<br>
This is the perfect spot to witness the contrast between Old San Juan and the modern city. Recognized with Blue Flag awards throughout the years, El Escambrón is the most picturesque beach in San Juan. There you can do anything from snorkeling and swimming to having a romantic stroll.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-condado-or-isla-verde>Which is better Condado or Isla Verde?</h2>
<p>Isla Verde is an absolutely pristine beach, more so than the beach in Condado. All of the hotels in this area have fine dining options and although there are some restaurants and convenience stores on the Main Street, the local area is not as densely walkable as Condado.</p>
<h2 id=is-condado-beach-nice>Is Condado beach nice?</h2>
<p>According to past travelers, you won’t be disappointed with Condado, as long as you recognize it’s not a remote strip of sand, but rather a beach that sits alongside a bustling city. But its proximity to so many hotels and resorts makes it all the more tourist-friendly.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-swim-in-the-ocean-in-puerto-rico>Can you swim in the ocean in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>Its wide ocean front and expanse of sand makes for good swimming, while trade winds along this part of the coast create a popular spot for kite and wind surfing. Many beaches in Puerto Rico are relatively secluded and quiet, but Ocean Park is lively, attracting a mix of both straight and gay beach-goers.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-bad-areas-of-puerto-rico>What are the bad areas of Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>Other spots to avoid at night are the neighborhoods of La Perla (next to Old City) and parts of Puerta de Tierra. Stick to the neighborhoods of Old San Juan, Isla Verde, Miramar and Condado at night, where there are regular police patrols. Should you have an emergency, call 911 as you would in the US.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-beautiful-part-of-puerto-rico>What is the most beautiful part of Puerto Rico?</h2>

<li>Ponce.</li>
<li>Rio Camuy Caves.</li>
<li>La Parguera Natural Reserve.</li>

<li>Fajardo. This area is popular among native Puerto Ricans and tourists alike.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=will-my-cell-phone-work-in-puerto-rico>Will my cell phone work in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>A: If you’re traveling to Puerto Rico as an American you don’t have to use an international plan—US cell phone plans work exactly the same in Puerto Rico as they do on the mainland. Most major carriers (including Verizon and AT) don’t charge roaming for voice and text service.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-beaches-in-san-juan-puerto-rico>Are there any beaches in San Juan Puerto Rico?</h2>

<h2 id=which-is-the-main-airport-in-puerto-rico>Which is the main airport in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>Teodoro Moscoso Bridge connecting the city of San Juan to the Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in Carolina. Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport is Puerto Rico’s main international gateway and its main connection to the United States.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-old-san-juan-airport-in-puerto-rico>Where is Old San Juan Airport in Puerto Rico?</h2>
<p>The airport is accessed from the San Juan district of Hato Rey, the island’s financial district, via the Teodoro Moscoso Bridge.
