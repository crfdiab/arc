<h2 id=what-fish-can-spit>What fish can spit?</h2>
<p>Archerfish<br>
Archerfish boast an unusual talent: They hunt by spitting powerful streams of water out of their mouths at unsuspecting above-water insects.</p>
<h2 id=did-a-man-really-get-swallowed-by-a-whale>Did a man really get swallowed by a whale?</h2>
<p>James Bartley (1870–1909) is the central figure in a late nineteenth-century story according to which he was swallowed whole by a sperm whale. He was found still living days later in the stomach of the whale, which was dead from harpooning.</p>
<h2 id=did-michael-packard-get-swallowed-by-a-whale>Did Michael Packard get swallowed by a whale?</h2>
<p>I survived.” Packard, who endured the humpback swig heard round the world on June 11, and is recovering from soft tissue damage, was both lighthearted and serious during the appearance, and Mayo reported on what he saw on the surface of the water. “And then last week, you were swallowed by a whale,” Kimmel began.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-man-who-was-swallowed-by-a-whale>What happened to the man who was swallowed by a whale?</h2>
<p>Massachusetts commercial lobster diver Michael Packard thought he was going to die after a humpback whale swallowed him into its mouth in 45 feet of water off Cape Cod. But he survived.</p>
<h2 id=are-archer-fish-aggressive>Are Archer fish aggressive?</h2>
<p>Archers can be a little temperamental, even aggressive, so it’s important to confirm compatibility before giving them a new friend in their tank. The Archer family is made up of the following six species: Toxotes blythi.</p>
<h2 id=do-archer-fish-spit-water>Do archer fish spit water?</h2>
<p>The name archer fish reflects its ability to take down prey both underwater and above the water by spitting an “arch” of water at it. The Toxotes genus is very small, containing only seven species.</p>
<h2 id=has-anyone-been-swallowed-by-a-whale-shark>Has anyone been swallowed by a whale shark?</h2>
<p>The diver recalls being hit hard by the whale shark. Then the diver was sucked into the mouth of the whale shark — head first — and half-swallowed up to her thighs. The diver struggled to escape the whale shark’s mouth for a brief moment before the shark spat the diver out, forcefully spinning her about in the water.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-can-archer-fish-spit>How far can archer fish spit?</h2>
<p>They found that the fish use the same mouth manoeuvres underwater as they do at the surface to produce jets that can dislodge insects as far as 2 metres away.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-keep-an-archer-fish-as-a-pet>Can you keep an archer fish as a pet?</h2>
<p>Archerfish do best when kept in large shoals in fairly large aquariums. Although they can grow to up to 11 inches in length in the wild, they rarely grow larger than 4-5 inches in the home aquarium. They are generally peaceful and make excellent additions to most brackish water community aquariums.</p>
<h2 id=what-part-of-its-body-does-the-archer-fish-shoot-drops-of-water-from>What part of its body does the archer fish shoot drops of water from?</h2>
<p>When an archerfish selects its prey, it rotates its eye so that the image of the prey falls on a particular portion of the eye in the ventral temporal periphery of the retina, and its lips just break the surface, squirting a jet of water at its victim.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fish-can-you-spearfish-in-new-england>What kind of fish can you Spearfish in New England?</h2>
<p>The only fish off-limits to spearos in these waters are lobster and striped bass. Massachusetts is popular for spearfishing black sea bass and tautog. Rhode Island has reciprocity with all of the New England states except New Hampshire. Fishing licenses run $7 for locals and $10 for non-residents.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fish-live-in-new-england>What kind of fish live in New England?</h2>
<p>Common Coastal Fish of New England Common Coastal Fish of New England Tautog TheTautog 1is bladkorgraya11d sometimes brown when they are young1. The Tautog i1s oommonlly found in rndky areas where it eatts shellfish, crabs, worms, snaills and shrimp_ U can grow</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-saltwater-fishing-license-in-new-england>Do you need a saltwater fishing license in New England?</h2>
<p>The rich history of fishing in the oceans of New England has meant that anglers didn’t need a saltwater fishing license. In 2010, however, all of that changed when the National Saltwater Angler Registry was created. In order, to keep track of the fish populations, the NSAR has been at the forefront of ethical fishing standards.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-spear-fish-in-new-hampshire>How much does it cost to spear fish in New Hampshire?</h2>
<p>The cost for a New Hampshire saltwater license is $12, making it a steal to fish in the waters off the coast in this state. All of the traditional saltwater angler regulations apply to spearos.</p>
