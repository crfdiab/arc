<h2 id=why-did-austria-hungary-want-war-with-serbia>Why did Austria-Hungary want war with Serbia?</h2>
<p>The immediate reason for Austria’s ultimatum was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie in Sarajevo, Bosnia on June 28, 1914 by the Bosnian Serb nationalist, Gavrilo Princip. With Franz Ferdinand’s death, Austria had the pretext it wanted to put the smaller and weaker Serbians in their place.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-serbia-declare-war-on-germany>Why did Serbia declare war on Germany?</h2>
<p>Setting the stage On July 23, Austria-Hungary demanded Serbia comply with its March 1909 declaration to the Great Powers to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary and issued the July Ultimatum.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-russia-do-after-austria-hungary-declared-war-on-the-nation-of-serbia>What did Russia do after Austria-Hungary declared war on the nation of Serbia?</h2>
<p>In response, Russia formally ordered mobilization in the four military districts facing Galicia, its common front with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. …</p>
<h2 id=what-two-nations-joined-the-conflict-between-serbia-and-austria-hungary>What two nations joined the conflict between Serbia and Austria-Hungary?</h2>
<p>An alliance is an agreement to act together. When Austria-Hungary declared war in July 1914, Germany joined the fight against Serbia.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-austria-hungary-declare-war-on-serbia>When did Austria Hungary declare war on Serbia?</h2>
<p>Austria-Hungary was not satisfied with this and on July 28, 1914, officially declared war on Serbia. In response, Russia orders mobilization and demands Germany to stand aside.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-germany-declare-war-on-russia-during-ww1>Why did Germany declare war on Russia during WW1?</h2>
<p>Germany warned Russia, still only partially mobilized, that if it were to mobilize fully against Austria-Hungary, this would mean war with Germany. While insisting with Russia that it should immediately suspend its mobilization, Germany initiated the mobilization itself.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-france-and-germany-declare-war-on-each-other>When did France and Germany declare war on each other?</h2>
<p>Russia’s ally, France, ordered its own general mobilization that same day, and on August 3, France and Germany declared war on each other. The German army’s planned invasion of neutral Belgium, announced on August 4, prompted Britain to declare war on Germany.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-go-to-war-with-austria>Why did the British go to war with Austria?</h2>
<p>The British Foreign Office lobbied its counterparts in Berlin, Paris and Rome with the idea of an international convention aimed at moderating the conflict; the German government, however, was set against this notion, and advised Vienna to go ahead with its plans.</p>
