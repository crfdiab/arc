<h2 id=why-is-australia-ruled-by-british>Why is Australia ruled by British?</h2>
<p>Australia governs itself through its prime minister and its Governor General, but the Queen of Great Britain, Queen Elizabeth the 2nd, is still the monarch of Australia, though she doesn’t directly rule it. Yes, the Australian government is a constitutional monarchy, which is why the queen has power there.</p>
<h2 id=does-britain-still-rule-australia>Does Britain still rule Australia?</h2>
<p>The present monarch is Elizabeth II, styled Queen of Australia, who has reigned since 6 February 1952. These are now almost the only constitutional functions of the monarch with regard to Australia. Australian constitutional law provides that the monarch of the United Kingdom is also the monarch in Australia.</p>
<h2 id=does-great-britain-own-australia>Does Great Britain Own Australia?</h2>
<p>The final constitutional ties between the United Kingdom and Australia ended in 1986 with the passing of the Australia Act 1986. Due to Australia’s history as a colony of Britain, the two nations retain significant shared threads of cultural heritage, many of which are common to all English-speaking countries.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-australian-government-still-under-british-rule>Is the Australian government still under British rule?</h2>
<p>Australia is not directly under British rule, but it is nominally under British rule. Australia is part of the Commonwealth of Nations, which is a collection of all the countries that have previously been under British rule.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-uk-still-in-charge-of-australia>Is the UK still in charge of Australia?</h2>
<p>NO, IT IS NOT. Australia is practically a Republic and the power of the British Monarch is an illusion. Australia severed the last tie with the British Empire in 1986. The Australia Act eliminated the remaining possibilities for the UK to legislate with effect in Australia, for the UK to be involved in Australian…</p>
<h2 id=why-was-australia-important-to-the-british-empire>Why was Australia important to the British Empire?</h2>
<p>The British empire took that a step further. In the late 1700’s they wanted to use one of their colonies for all the criminals. They originally wanted to use the Americas as the jail, but the Americas revolted in the 1770’s so they turned to Australia. The first camps were established in the 1780’s.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-relationship-between-britain-and-australia-end>When did the relationship between Britain and Australia end?</h2>
<p>Until 1949, Britain and Australia shared a common nationality code. The final constitutional ties between the United Kingdom and Australia ended in 1986 with the passing of the Australia Act 1986. Formal economic relations between the two countries declined following Britain’s accession to the European Economic Community in 1973.</p>
