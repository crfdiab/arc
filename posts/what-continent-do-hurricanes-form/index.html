<h2 id=what-continent-do-hurricanes-form>What continent do hurricanes form?</h2>
<p>“Hurricanes form both in the Atlantic basin, to the east of the continental U.S. (that is, in the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea), and in the Northeast Pacific basin, to the west of the U.S. The hurricanes in the Northeast Pacific almost never hit the U.S., however, whereas the ones in the …</p>
<h2 id=where-do-hurricanes-form-over>Where do hurricanes form over?</h2>
<p>Hurricanes are the most violent storms on Earth. They form near the equator over warm ocean waters. Actually, the term hurricane is used only for the large storms that form over the Atlantic Ocean or eastern Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-hurricanes-form-in-africa>Where do hurricanes form in Africa?</h2>
<p>Most of the hurricanes that hit the United States come from Africa. It’s a point off West Africa’s coast near Cape Verde. High altitude winds form as a result of two clashing climates. The hot, dry Sahara dessert and the cooler, wetter regions to the south.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-hurricanes-hit-florida>Where do hurricanes hit Florida?</h2>
<p>Surprisingly enough — or maybe not surprising at all to some people — Northwest Florida, situated on the Panhandle, is the most hurricane-prone area in Florida. That’s partly due to the Gulf of Mexico, which is known for its warm shallow waters, and partly due to its location in the U.S.</p>
<h2 id=has-canada-ever-had-a-hurricane>Has Canada ever had a hurricane?</h2>
<p>Canada is usually only hit with weak storms, due to the generally cool waters immediately offshore. The strongest hurricane to make landfall in Canada was Hurricane Ginny of 1963, which had winds of 110 mph (175 km/h), making it a strong Category 2 hurricane at the time of its landfall near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-hurricanes-in-the-atlantic-ocean>Are there any Hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean?</h2>
<p>People call these storms by other names, such as typhoons or cyclones, depending on where they occur. The scientific term for all these storms is tropical cyclone. Only tropical cyclones that form over the Atlantic Ocean or eastern Pacific Ocean are called “hurricanes.”</p>
<h2 id=where-do-hurricanes-form-in-the-united-states>Where do hurricanes form in the United States?</h2>
<p>During this peak hurricanes can form in the Atlantic ocean, Gulf of Mexico or Caribbean Sea. Locations that may be affected are the Caribbean, Bermuda, Central America including eastern Mexico, the eastern and Gulf coasts of the United States, and eastern Canada.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-tropical-storms-form-in-the-atlantic>When do tropical storms form in the Atlantic?</h2>
<p>Most systems form in the western Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico. Tropical storm and hurricane activity in the Atlantic typically remains fairly light during the hurricane season’s first month before things really heat up August into early October.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-hurricanes-off-the-coast-of-africa>Are there any hurricanes off the coast of Africa?</h2>
<p>Hurricane Irma in 2017 was one such long-track hurricane that began as a tropical wave off the coast of Africa.</p>
