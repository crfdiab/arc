<h2 id=can-you-travel-to-mexico-if-you-have-a-criminal-record>Can you travel to Mexico if you have a criminal record?</h2>
<p>In many cases, it is possible to visit Mexico despite having a criminal record. Generally, misdemeanors are not considered grounds for denied entry and will not prevent foreigners from going to Mexico on vacation. Foreigners who require a visa for Mexico must disclose details of their criminal history when applying.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-enter-mexico-from-canada-with-a-criminal-record>Can you enter Mexico from Canada with a criminal record?</h2>
<p>Immigration authorities may decide to refuse your request to enter the country if you are subject to criminal process (facing charges) or have been convicted of a serious crime as defined by national laws on criminal matters or provisions in international treaties or conventions that the Mexican State is party to.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-convicted-felon-get-a-passport-and-travel-to-mexico>Can a convicted felon get a passport and travel to Mexico?</h2>
<p>Current regulations state that in order to enter Mexico, a passport is required. Being convicted of drug trafficking or a crime of treason against the U.S. may prevent felons from being able to obtain a passport, as well as for any felon owing at least a certain amount of child support.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-pardon-in-canada>How much is a pardon in Canada?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, a Canadian pardon cannot be done for free. The cost of filing a pardon with the Parole Board of Canada is $657.77. But keep in mind that this amount is only the FINAL cost payable to the government of Canada AFTER all the paperwork has been completed.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-travel-to-mexico-with-a-criminal-record>Can you travel to Mexico with a criminal record?</h2>
<p>No sex crimes then you are welcome in Mexico. US Border Patrol states that if you are diverted because of an issue with the flight that the border agents would detain you until your flight departs. You are still able to go on your trip but not roam around mexico. 5. Re: Criminal Record – Travelling from Canada direct to Mexico</p>
<h2 id=can-a-person-with-a-criminal-record-enter-canada>Can a person with a criminal record enter Canada?</h2>
<p>Canada’s entry policy is similar to the US and anyone with a criminal record no matter how minor, even a drink-driving conviction, may be excluded from entering Canada. If you do have a conviction and want to enter Canada, you could submit an application for rehabilitation, under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-person-with-a-pardon-record-travel-to-mexico>Can a person with a pardon record travel to Mexico?</h2>
<p>Mexican authorities should not be able to view a pardon record. Never the less, you are still inadmissible to Mexico. If you will be travelling through the United States on route to Mexico, you will require an entry waiver. Click here for further information</p>
<h2 id=can-a-canadian-citizen-go-to-mexico-without-a-passport>Can a Canadian citizen go to Mexico without a passport?</h2>
<p>“Since March 1, 2010, Canadian citizens, including those with dual nationality, are required to present a valid passport in order to enter and exit Mexico. Canadians without a valid passport will be refused entry and returned to Canada.”</p>
