<h2 id=what-months-can-your-electric-not-be-shut-off-in-wisconsin>What months can your electric not be shut off in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>The PSC imposed a shut-off ban after Gov. Tony Evers authorized emergency action on March 23 and later extended it until the start of the traditional winter moratorium, which prohibits shut-offs from Nov. 1 to April 15.</p>
<h2 id=can-utilities-be-shut-off-during-covid-in-wisconsin>Can utilities be shut off during Covid in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>Utilities in Wisconsin will once again be able to shut off services for customers who fail to pay their bills. The Public Service Commission voted unanimously Thursday to end the moratorium blocking utilities from disconnecting power, a policy put in place to help residents financially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h2 id=can-power-be-shut-off-remotely>Can power be shut off remotely?</h2>
<p>If we must disconnect a customer, and they have a smart meter, service can be disconnected remotely. Having said that, there are strict guidelines set forth by the California Public Utilities Commission regarding the disconnection of a customer’s service.”</p>
<h2 id=can-they-cut-your-gas-off>Can they cut your gas off?</h2>
<p>Gas and electricity companies cannot cut off your supply unless they have first offered you a range of payment methods to help you pay. They must only disconnect your supply as a last resort and they must give you proper notice first.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-know-if-my-power-has-been-cut-off>How do I know if my power has been cut off?</h2>
<p>If you see a BLANK screen, there is a Power Outage at your home. Finally, if you see the letters “CLS” — this is an indication the power is ON and flowing to the house. If power is not on inside the house, it’s time to check the circuit breakers, or call an electrician. There you have it!</p>
<h2 id=can-the-municipality-cut-off-electricity-during-lockdown>Can the municipality cut off electricity during lockdown?</h2>
<p>The answer is yes. There is no obligation on the Municipality to provide you with electricity supply if you do not pay your rates and taxes. This court said that the Municipality could not disconnect the electricity supply without obtaining a court order first.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-get-your-power-cut-off-in-wisconsin>When do you get your power cut off in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>Thousands of utility customers around Wisconsin could get their power cut off, starting Monday, if they have not been paying their utility bills all winter. The annual moratorium on disconnections that started Nov. 1 will end on April 15.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-utility-shutoffs-in-the-winter>Why are there utility shutoffs in the winter?</h2>
<p>If this was a normal year, 40 states would have implemented some form of utility shutoff moratoriums during the winter months to protect customers from losing their home heating when the temperature drops. Under normal circumstances, these policies can be difficult to track since they vary between states.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-winter-moratorium-end-in-wisconsin>When does the winter moratorium end in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>Judy Newman is a business reporter for the Wisconsin State Journal. Madison Gas & Electric is reminding customers to pay their delinquent bills or their utility service could be shut off, starting Monday. The annual winter moratorium on utility disconnections ends April 15.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-states-that-have-a-winter-shutoff-ban>Are there any states that have a winter shutoff ban?</h2>
<p>Some states that would normally have temperature-based moratoriums are still operating under COVID shutoff bans that protect customers regardless of the weather. And then there are states that do not normally have an annual winter shutoff moratorium, some of which have ongoing COVID moratoriums, while others either never had any or let them expire.</p>
