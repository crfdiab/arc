<p>The Crusades<br>
The Crusades were a series of religious wars initiated, supported, and sometimes directed by the Latin Church in the medieval period. The best known of these Crusades are those to the Holy Land in the period between 1095 and 1291 that were intended to liberate Jerusalem and its surrounding area from Islamic rule.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-holy-war>When was the last holy war?</h2>
<p>The great series of western holy wars were the Crusades, which lasted from 1095 until 1291 CE. The aim was to capture the sacred places in the Holy Land from the Muslims who lived there, so it was intended as a war to right wrongs done against Christianity.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-holy-war-in-islam>What is Holy War in Islam?</h2>
<p>Holy war. When Muslims, or their faith or territory are under attack, Islam permits (some say directs) the believer to wage military war to protect them. In recent years the most common meaning of Jihad has been Holy War. And there is a long tradition of Jihad being used to mean a military struggle to benefit Islam.</p>

<h2 id=where-did-the-meeting-of-the-holy-wars-take-place>Where did the meeting of the Holy Wars take place?</h2>
<p>History Of Crusades The Holy Wars Pope Urban II called a meeting of important clergymen in the year 1905. The meeting took place in the town of Clermont located in France. The meeting was in response to the plea of Alexius Comnenus, the emperor of Byzantine, asking for soldiers to fight the Turkish Muslims.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-crusade-to-the-holy-land>When was the Last Crusade to the Holy Land?</h2>
<p>Ninth Crusade (1271 – 1272) The last in the series of military expeditions that sought to recapture the Holy Land from the Muslims was launched by Prince Edward of England who also took part of the Eight Crusade.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-third-condition-of-a-holy-war>What is the third condition of a holy war?</h2>
<p>The third condition of a holy war is a spiritual reward for those who take part. The doctrine of the just war does not refer to any personal rewards for the participants – and such rewards would be against such a generally austere doctrine.</p>
