<h2 id=how-long-can-you-be-a-dual-citizen-in-the-philippines>How long can you be a dual citizen in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>HOW LONG CAN I STAY IN THE PHILIPPINES? You can stay in the Philippines indefinitely provided that upon your arrival in the Philippines you present before the Philippine Immigration Officer your valid US/Foreign passport and your Dual Citizenship Documents.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-foreigner-residing-permanently-in-the-philippines>Is a foreigner residing permanently in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Yes, under the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, Section 13 (a) you are eligible for permanent residency in the Philippines. This visa is issued to an alien on the basis of his valid marriage to a Philippine citizen. He was allowed entry into the Philippines and was authorized by Immigration authorities to stay.</p>
<h2 id=can-an-australian-own-a-house-in-the-philippines>Can an Australian own a house in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Foreigners are prohibited from owning land in the Philippines, but can legally own a residence. The Philippine Condominium Act allows foreigners to own condo units, as long as 60% of the building is owned by Filipinos. If you want to buy a house, consider a long-term lease agreement with a Filipino landowner.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-move-to-the-philippines-from-australia>Can I move to the Philippines from Australia?</h2>
<p>Australia has a visa-waiver scheme with the Philippines, meaning that if you want to go and spend some time there before you commit to a move, you’ll have 59 days on entry without needing a work visa. In addition to your work visa, you’ll need to register to an Alien Employment Permit.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-dual-citizenship-to-go-to-the-philippines>Do you need dual citizenship to go to the Philippines?</h2>
<p>While it is not mandatory to have a Philippine passport to enter the Philippines, the said dual citizens are required to present their Identification Certificate, together with their foreign passport, to the Immigration Officer upon arrival.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-filipino-born-in-australia-become-an-australian-citizen>Can a Filipino born in Australia become an Australian citizen?</h2>
<p>Organise Citizenship By Descent for Filipino-born Australian Children so they may travel to Australia on an Australian passport to live freely like other Aussies. Get expert help from the Australian visa experts in Manila Philippines. Are you an Australian Citizen with biological children born in the Philippines?</p>
<h2 id=how-long-can-a-british-citizen-stay-in-the-philippines>How long can a British citizen stay in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>To answer your questions, A & B: A British citizen can only stay in the Philippines for 30days. However, if the British citizen is married to a Filipino citizen or Balikbayan status (meaning citizen of another country but originally a Filipino citizen) can stay in the Philippines for a year.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-foreign-citizen-of-the-philippines-become-a-filipino-citizen>Can a foreign citizen of the Philippines become a Filipino citizen?</h2>
<p>Foreign nationals who were born outside of the Philippines to a Filipino parent (Note: the parent/s must be Philippine citizen/s at the time of the applicant’s birth) may apply for Recognition as a Filipino citizen, without losing the current citizenship of the applicant.

<h2 id=can-a-dual-citizen-of-the-philippines-enter-the-philippines>Can a dual citizen of the Philippines enter the Philippines?</h2>
<p>You can still use this passport to enter the Philippines and enjoy the perks as a true national of the country. Once the current Philippine passport expires, you have to apply for the citizenship re-acquisition. Read More: How to Get A Balikbayan Visa for Foreign Spouse and Filipino Dual Citizen</p>
