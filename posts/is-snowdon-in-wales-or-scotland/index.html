<p>Snowdon is composed mainly of slates and porphyries that date from the Ordovician Period (490 million to 443 million years ago). Intense glaciation has affected the entire locality, producing the ridges, cirques, and numerous small lakes that nestle in the lower valleys radiating out from Snowdon.</p>
