<h2 id=what-was-the-japanese-objective-for-the-attack-and-did-they-accomplish-their-goal>What was the Japanese objective for the attack and did they accomplish their goal?</h2>
<p>The Japanese strategy was to destroy the invader’s landing vessels before they hit the beaches. For this purpose, Japan had reserved about 5,000 conventional aircraft and a variety of suicide vehicles, including about 5,500 kamikaze planes, 1,300 suicide submarines, and several hundred piloted bombs.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-japans-ultimatum-to-the-united-states>What was Japan’s ultimatum to the United States?</h2>
<p>The Potsdam Declaration, or the Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender, was a statement that called for the surrender of all Japanese armed forces during World War II. The ultimatum stated that, if Japan did not surrender, it would face “prompt and utter destruction.”</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-reason-for-the-entry-of-us-in-the-second-world-war>What was the reason for the entry of US in the Second World war?</h2>
<p>The most immediate reason for the US’s actual entry into WWII was the Japanese attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in what was then the Territory of Hawaii. The Japanese attack led to the US declaring war on Japan. From there, Germany declared war on the US and the US was fully involved.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-us-expect-a-japanese-attack>Where did the US expect a Japanese attack?</h2>
<p>In May 1940, the United States had made Pearl Harbor the main base for its Pacific Fleet. As Americans didn’t expect the Japanese to attack first in Hawaii, some 4,000 miles away from the Japanese mainland, the base at Pearl Harbor was left relatively undefended, making it an easy target.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-locations-of-the-four-most-important-world-war-ii-conferences>What were the locations of the four most important World War II conferences?</h2>
<p>Casablanca, Potsdam, Tehran, and Yalta were the locations of the four most important World War II conferences. This is a record of World War II conferences of the colleagues of World War II.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-the-us-might-have-been-able-to-fight-either-germany-or-japan-while-avoiding-armed-conflict-with-the-other>Is it possible the US might have been able to fight either Germany or Japan while avoiding armed conflict with the other?</h2>
<p>Is it possible the U.S. might have been able to fight either Germany or Japan, while avoiding armed conflict with the other? Yes because Japan bombed Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941 and on December 11, 1941 Hitler declared war on the United States. December 7th was when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-american-occupation-of-japan>What was the result of the American occupation of Japan?</h2>
<p>The constitution established many new civil liberties, such as the right of free speech, and the powers of the police were weakened and carefully regulated. Finally, the military forces were completely abolished and Article 9 of the new constitution forbade Japan to maintain an army or go to war ever again.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-postwar-success-of-the-japanese-economy-so-impressive>Why was the postwar success of the Japanese economy so impressive?</h2>
<p>Loading… To many business people and public officials in the West, the postwar success of the Japanese economy is both an impressive and a puzzling achievement. The success is obvious and measurable; the reasons for it, far less so.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-failed-attempt-to-avert-war-with-japan>What was the failed attempt to avert war with Japan?</h2>
<p>The U.S. and Japan began negotiations to end sanctions and make peace, but their efforts were unsuccessful.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-japanese-objective-in-world-war-2>What was the Japanese objective in World War 2?</h2>
<p>Its principal objectives were to secure the resources of Southeast Asia and much of China and to establish a “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere” under Japanese hegemony.</p>
