<h2 id=how-many-horses-can-you-have-per-acre-in-florida>How many horses can you have per acre in Florida?</h2>
<p>Ten horses per acre on five to ten acres up to 100 horses; Ten horses per acre on more than ten acres or more than 100 horses.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-land-do-you-have-to-have-to-own-a-horse-in-florida>How much land do you have to have to own a horse in Florida?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the choice is yours. You’ll need to make sure you have enough space (most counties and municipalities require at least 5 acres of pasture land), that you can fence the area property, and that you allow space for the number of horses you have (many areas require one acre per horse).</p>
<h2 id=how-many-acres-of-land-do-you-need-to-have-horses>How many acres of land do you need to have horses?</h2>
<p>In general, professionals recommend two acres for the first horse and an additional acre for each additional horse (e.g., five acres for four horses). And, of course, more land is always better depending on the foraging quality of your particular property (70% vegetative cover is recommended).</p>
<h2 id=can-grass-cuttings-kill-horses>Can grass cuttings kill horses?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, grass cuttings are potentially very dangerous for horses to eat and sadly many have died as a result of people putting lawn mowings over the fence into horse pastures. Any plants that are caught up in the grass cuttings, or fed direct to the horse, could be poisonous to them.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-horses-per-acre-in-south-florida>How many horses per acre in South Florida?</h2>
<p>Grass is unlikely to grow well and you will need to supplement with hay and grain. Keeping horses in South Florida is a different story. It is very common for 10+ horses to be kept on 5 acres because the soil is sandy and the grass provides little more than entertainment value.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-limit-on-the-number-of-horses-per-acre>Is there a limit on the number of horses per acre?</h2>
<p>Without access, many equestrians, horse enthusiasts and the general public would not be able to enjoy horses. Zoning ordinances that limit the number of horses may inadvertently diminish access to horses. Existing ordinances in many communities set a maximum number of horses per acre.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-horses-do-you-need-for-an-acre>What kind of horses do you need for an acre?</h2>
<p>Horses that are easy keepers tend to do well on smaller acreage. On the whole, this includes quarter horses, ponies, and draft breeds. Thoroughbreds—yeah, you knew it was coming—and older horses are generally not included on the list of easy keepers.</p>

<p>Whether the horses are turned out 24 hours a day. How settled the group of horses is – a well settled group won’t churn the ground up as much as an unsettled one that gallop around or fight. Drainage. The general rule is to allow at least one and a half acres of grazing for the first horse and one acre for each horse or pony after that.</p>
