<h2 id=what-is-another-name-for-the-scottish-flag>What is another name for the Scottish Flag?</h2>
<p>The Flag of Scotland, also known as St Andrew’s Cross or the Saltire, is essentially just a white cross on a blue rectangle.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-yellow-scottish-flag-called>What is the yellow Scottish Flag called?</h2>
<p>Saltire<br>
The Flag of Scotland, also known as the Saint Andrew’s Cross or more commonly The Saltire, is the national flag of Scotland.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-the-two-scottish-flags>What is the difference between the two Scottish flags?</h2>
<p>There are actually two Scottish flags, but only the Saltire is recognised as official. The other is the Lion Rampant, which is referred to as the ‘Royal Flag of Scotland’.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-scotlands-flag-blue-and-white>Why is Scotland’s flag blue and white?</h2>
<p>As recommended by a Scottish Parliamentary committee in 2003, the shade of blue on the Saltire became standardized to the shade Pantone 300. Part of the tradition is that St Andrew wore blue, and so the white of the wooden cross he was crucified on against the blue of his robes gave us the colours of our national flag.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-scotland-have-a-yellow-flag>Why do Scotland have a yellow flag?</h2>
<p>Story has it that St Andrew became the patron saint of Scotland when in the 9th century, King Angus of Scotland was preparing for a battle against the English, St Andrew came to him in a dream promising victory and the symbol of the X appeared in the sky – St Andrew’s saltire.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-name-of-the-national-flag-of-scotland>What’s the name of the national flag of Scotland?</h2>
<p>The Royal Standard of Scotland, also known as the Banner of the King of Scots or more commonly the Lion Rampant of Scotland, is the Scottish Royal Banner of Arms. Used historically by the King of Scots, the Royal Standard of Scotland differs from Scotland’s national flag, the Saltire,…</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-nickname-of-the-united-kingdom-flag>What is the nickname of the United Kingdom flag?</h2>
<p>The proper name is the Union Flag, because it symbolises the union of three Kingdoms: England (including Wales), Ireland and Scotland. It has at least two nicknames that I am aware of. The first is what many people call it, thinking it is the actual name; ‘the Union Jack’. No flag is a jack until such time as it is flown from a ship.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-coat-of-arms-of-scotland>What is the coat of arms of Scotland?</h2>
<p>This Lion Rampant was eventually adopted as the Scottish royal coat of arms and incorporated into the Great Seal of Scotland.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-national-emblem-of-scotland>How tall is the national emblem of Scotland?</h2>
<p>The Thistle – National Emblem of Scotland. Common in the highlands, islands and lowlands of Scotland, the prickly purple thistle has been Scotland’s national emblem for centuries. The thistle, which grows to a height of five feet, has no natural enemies because of the vicious spines that cover it.</p>
