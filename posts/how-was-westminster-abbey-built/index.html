<p>Edward the Confessor built a new church on the site, which was consecrated on December 28, 1065. It was of considerable size and cruciform in plan. In 1245 Henry III pulled down the whole of Edward’s church (except the nave) and replaced it with the present abbey church in the pointed Gothic style of the period.</p>

<p>Westminster Abbey was designed to display the finest characteristics of British history and architecture. As influences in architectural design changed, the Abbey developed a Gothic style of architecture, most prominently displayed in the towers. The chapter house was created to demand the presences of royal weddings, coronations, and burials.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-pipe-organ-installed-in-westminster-abbey>When was the pipe organ installed in Westminster Abbey?</h2>
<p>Tourists flock to marvel at Westminster Abbey’s gothic design, including its fan-vaulted ceilings and the magnificent pipe organ, installed for the coronation of King George VI in 1937. The organ contains some of the original piping of its predecessor instrument, which was built in 1848. There is also the Grave to the Unknown Warrior.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-stained-glass-is-in-westminster-abbey>What kind of stained glass is in Westminster Abbey?</h2>
<p>The great west window and the rose window in the north transept date from the early 18th century but the remainder of the glass is from the 19th century onwards. The newest stained glass is in The Queen Elizabeth II window, designed by David Hockney.</p>
