<h2 id=why-was-the-swiss-army-knife-made>Why was the Swiss Army knife made?</h2>
<p>In the late 1880s, before there was ever an official Swiss Army knife, the Swiss Army decided to purchase a simple folding pocket knife for their soldiers. This knife was intended for use by the army in opening canned food and disassembling the M1889 Swiss service rifle which required a screwdriver for assembly.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-swiss-army-knife-actually-swiss>Is the Swiss Army knife actually Swiss?</h2>
<p>The German Swiss Army knife It’s not just a clever name: Swiss Army knives were originally made for the Swiss military beginning in the 1880s. Members of the Swiss military received the first Elsener-designed knife, complete with a blade, reamer, screwdriver, and can opener, in 1891.</p>

<p>While Wenger touted itself as the “Genuine Swiss Army Knife,” Victorinox laid claim to being the “Original Swiss Army Knife.” The two companies split the contract for providing knives to the Swiss Army from 1908 until Victorinox acquired Wenger in 2005. When Karl Elsner’s mother died in 1909, Elsener renamed his company “Victoria” in her memory.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-countries-use-victorinox-swiss-army-knives>How many countries use Victorinox Swiss Army knives?</h2>
<p>The armed forces of more than 20 different nations have issued or approved the use of various versions of Swiss army knives made by Victorinox, among them the forces of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Malaysia and the United States (NSN 1095-01-653-1166 Knife, Combat).</p>

<p>When Karl Elsner’s mother died in 1909, Elsener renamed his company “Victoria” in her memory. In 1921 the company started using newly invented stainless steel to make the Swiss Army Knife. Stainless steel is known as “inox”, short for the French term acier inoxydable .</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-swiss-army-start-using-stainless-steel>When did the Swiss Army start using stainless steel?</h2>
<p>In 1921, as the company started using stainless steel, Elsener’s son, Carl Elsener, renamed the company to “Victorinox”, incorporating the abbreviation “inox” for acier inoxydable, the French term for stainless steel. During 1961–2005, the pocket knives issued by the Swiss military were produced exclusively by Victorinox and Wenger.</p>
