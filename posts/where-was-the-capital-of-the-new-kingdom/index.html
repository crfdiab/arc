<h2 id=where-was-the-capital-of-the-new-kingdom>Where was the capital of the New Kingdom?</h2>
<p>The pharaohs of the New Kingdom were determined to protect their land at any cost. The pharaohs of the New Kingdom modernized their armies. The capital of Egypt was moved to Thebes in Upper Egypt, far away from possible attacks from the northeast.</p>
<h2 id=where-the-capital-city-was-in-the-old-middle-and-new-kingdom>Where the capital city was in the old Middle and New Kingdom?</h2>
<p>Thebes<br>
Thebes was the main city of the fourth Upper Egyptian nome (Sceptre nome) and was the capital of Egypt for long periods during the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom eras. It was close to Nubia and the Eastern Desert, with its valuable mineral resources and trade routes.</p>
<h2 id=who-destroyed-memphis-egypt>Who destroyed Memphis Egypt?</h2>
<p>Cambyses II<br>
The collapse of Assyria (612 bce) led to brief Egyptian independence under the 26th dynasty (664–525 bce; see ancient Egypt: The Late period), but it was not long before new invaders appeared. The Persian Cambyses II took Memphis by siege in 525 bce.</p>

<h2 id=where-was-the-capital-of-the-old-kingdom>Where was the capital of the Old Kingdom?</h2>
<p>Not only was the last king of the Early Dynastic Period related to the first two kings of the Old Kingdom, but the “capital”—the royal residence—remained at Ineb-Hedg, the Ancient Egyptian name for Memphis.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-king-of-the-old-kingdom-of-egypt>Who was the first king of the Old Kingdom of Egypt?</h2>
<p>Under King Djoser, the first king of the Third Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, the royal capital of Egypt was moved to Memphis, where Djoser established his court.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-in-the-old-kingdom>Who was the king in the Old Kingdom?</h2>
<p>The king was essentially a living god, who held all power and was at the apex of a highly stratified society. Indeed, the administration was extremely centralized, and most top-level high officials were close relatives of the king, often his own sons.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-new-kingdom-of-egypt>What was the purpose of the New Kingdom of Egypt?</h2>
<p>Possibly as a result of the foreign rule of the Hyksos during the Second Intermediate Period, the New Kingdom saw Egypt attempt to create a buffer between the Levant and Egypt proper, and during this time Egypt attained its greatest territorial extent.</p>
