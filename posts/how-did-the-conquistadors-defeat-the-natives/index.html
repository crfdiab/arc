<h2 id=how-did-the-conquistadors-defeat-the-natives>How did the conquistadors defeat the natives?</h2>
<p>The natives knew war, but their tactics were sophomoric and based on their religious beliefs. They would not fight to kill, but to capture. After capturing the army they would sacrifice them to their gods. These tactics were ignorant and allowed the Spanish to easily crush them.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-one-reason-the-spanish-conquistadors-were-able-to-conquer-the-aztec-empire>What was one reason the Spanish conquistadors were able to conquer the Aztec empire?</h2>
<p>What was one reason the Spanish conquistadors were able to conquer the Aztec Empire? (1) The Spanish soldiers made effective use of their military technology against the Aztecs. (2) Aztec religious beliefs promoted nonviolence. (3) Spain joined the Incas in their fight against the Aztecs.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spanish-defeat-the-inca-empire>How did the Spanish defeat the Inca Empire?</h2>
<p>Francisco Pizarro’s conquest of the Incan empire is one of the most extraordinary achievements in military history. In the space of a single day in 1532, less than two hundred Spanish conquistadors defeated an army thousands strong and captured Emperor Atahualpa, the warlike ruler of a nation that had crushed all its neighbours.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-pizarro-get-control-of-the-inca-empire>How did Pizarro get control of the Inca Empire?</h2>
<p>By the middle of the following year, Pizarro and his men would have the Incan Empire firmly under their control, turning it into a province of the burgeoning Spanish Empire in the New World. Far from home and vastly outnumbered, how did Pizarro and his band achieve this extraordinary feat?</p>
<h2 id=why-was-atahualpa-so-important-to-the-incas>Why was Atahualpa so important to the Incas?</h2>
<p>For the past five years, Atahualpa and his half-brother Huascar had been fighting for control of the Incan Empire. Following the death in 1527 of their father Huayna Capac, these two men had grappled to become his heir, with Atahualpa dominating in the north, where he had been involved in military expansion, and Huascar more powerful in the south.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-hernando-de-soto-beat-the-incas>Why did Hernando de Soto beat the Incas?</h2>
<p>At the first meeting between the Incas and conquistador representatives, the Spaniard Hernando de Soto decided to show off his horse and put the wind up the natives. Charging Atahualpa’s guards, he sent them running in terror from the threat of being trampled by the horse.</p>
