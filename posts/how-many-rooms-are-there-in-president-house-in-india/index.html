<h2 id=how-many-rooms-are-there-in-president-house-in-india>How many rooms are there in President House in India?</h2>
<p>340 rooms<br>
This mansion has a total of 340 rooms spread over four floors, 2.5 kilometres of corridors and 190 acres of garden area.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-room-are-there-in-the-president-house>How many room are there in the President House?</h2>
<p>This vast mansion has got four floors and 340 rooms. With a floor area of 200, 000 square feet, it is built by using 700 million bricks and three million cubic feet of stone. Hardly any steel has gone into the construction of the building.</p>
<h2 id=does-president-really-live-in-rashtrapati-bhavan>Does President really live in Rashtrapati Bhavan?</h2>
<p>Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, is an imposing edifice located at the west end of the Rajpath in New Delhi with the India gate at the opposite end.</p>

<p>The Rashtrapati Bhavan has a total of 340 rooms spread on four floors.</p>

<p>Rashtrapati Bhavan<br>
Worlds biggest President’s house – Rashtrapati Bhavan.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-rooms-are-there-in-the-white-house>How many rooms are there in the White House?</h2>
<p>The massive building contains three connected but distinct sections: the East Wing, the West Wing, and the Executive Residence in the middle. Two colonnades run between them. Arrows show the locations of the White House’s three sections. In total, the White House has 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, and 28 fireplaces.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-bathrooms-so-small-in-indian-homes>Why are bathrooms so small in Indian homes?</h2>
<p>Small bathrooms are a common feature in most Indian apartments. Sometimes, they can seem uncomfortably cramped to the extent that you feel you don’t have elbow room or space for turning around without bumping into something. However, you can maximize the available space through clever design.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-pool-room-in-the-white-house>Is there a pool room in the White House?</h2>
<p>A number of presidents have owned pool tables in the White House, at times housing them in the modern-day Map Room and Vermeil Room. It’s unclear when the Game Room — formerly a bedroom — became the designated pool space, but it dates back to at least the George H. W. Bush era, according to the White House Museum.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-bathroom-design-in-india>Which is the best bathroom design in India?</h2>
<p>A part of a Mediterranean inspired home in Mumbai, it uses colour and patterns to distract from the lack of space. A dark blue wall contrasted by a lovely white framed mirror, a combination of plain white tiles mixed with beautiful floral tiles in white, blue and yellow, and the exquisite blue hanging lamps give it a distinctly Turkish feel.</p>
