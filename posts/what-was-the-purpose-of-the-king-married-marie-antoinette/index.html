<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-king-married-marie-antoinette>What was the purpose of the king married Marie Antoinette?</h2>
<p>Marriage of the Dauphin Louis and Marie-Antoinette 16-17 May 1770. In 1756, after three centuries of animosity, France and Austria became allies. To consolidate this diplomatic reconciliation, Louis XV and Empress Maria Theresa decided to marry their respective children.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-king-louis-xvi-and-queen-marie-antoinette-try-to-do-on-june-21-1791>What did King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette try to do on June 21 1791?</h2>
<p>An unsuccessful attempt to escape Paris by King Louis XVI of France, his wife Marie Antoinette, and their immediate family during the night of June 20-21, 1791 to initiate a counter-revolution at the head of loyal troops under royalist officers concentrated at Montmédy near the frontier.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-queen-marie-antoinette-say>What did Queen Marie Antoinette say?</h2>
<p>At some point around 1789, when being told that her French subjects had no bread, Marie-Antoinette (bride of France’s King Louis XVI) supposedly sniffed, “Qu’ils mangent de la brioche”—“Let them eat cake.” With that callous remark, the queen became a hated symbol of the decadent monarchy and fueled the revolution that …</p>
<h2 id=did-the-queen-of-france-really-say-let-them-eat-cake>Did the Queen of France really say let them eat cake?</h2>
<p>There’s no evidence that Marie-Antoinette ever said “let them eat cake.” But we do know people have been attributing the phrase “Qu’ils mangent de la brioche” to her for nearly two hundred years — and debunking it for just as long. The first time the quote was connected to Antoinette in print was in 1843.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-french-people-react-to-marie-antoinette>Why did the French people react to Marie Antoinette?</h2>
<p>To top it off, Louis had the misfortune to marry a foreigner, the Austrian Marie Antoinette. The anger of the French people, fueled by xenophobia, targeted Marie as a prime source of their problems. In 1788, Louis was forced to reinstate France’s National Assembly (the Estates-General) which quickly curtailed the king’s powers.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-louis-xvi-allow-marie-antoinette-to-renovate-her-palace>Why did Louis XVI allow Marie Antoinette to renovate her palace?</h2>
<p>Louis XVI allowed Marie Antoinette to renovate it to suit her own tastes; soon rumours circulated that she had plastered the walls with gold and diamonds. The queen spent heavily on fashion, luxuries and gambling, though the country was facing a grave financial crisis and the population was suffering.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-louis-xvi-and-marie-antoinette-adopt-amilcar>How did Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette adopt Amilcar?</h2>
<p>Louis “gifted” the boy to Marie Antoinette, who insisted he instead be freed and adopted by the family—after being baptized as a Catholic, of course. Amilcar never actually lived with the royal family, unlike the three white adopted children of Louis and Marie Antoinette, but the queen still paid for his upbringing.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-marie-antoinette-give-birth-to-her-fifteenth-child>When did Marie Antoinette give birth to her fifteenth child?</h2>
<p>Thought of as the power behind the throne, Marie Antoinette prophesied, “They are going to force us to go to Paris, the King and me, preceded by the heads of our bodyguards on pikes.” (Public Domain) The Austrian Empress Maria Theresa gave birth to her fifteenth child, Marie Antoinette, on November 2, 1755.
