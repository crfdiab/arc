<h2 id=were-there-diseases-in-ancient-greece>Were there diseases in ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>Only from descriptions and writings of ancient physicians can we infer the presence of various infectious diseases in antiquity. Infectious diarrheas and dysentery, as described by the ancients, imply that typhoid fever was an endemic problem in the ancient world. Similarly, malaria existed in ancient Greece.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-greeks-believe-caused-diseases>What did the Greeks believe caused diseases?</h2>
<p>Greeks believed that evil spirits or angry gods caused diseases, and that the gods such as Asclepius, son of Apollo, could heal and cure diseases.</p>
<h2 id=what-diseases-did-greece-have>What diseases did Greece have?</h2>
<p>Among the many suggestions as the diagnosis has been Ebola, typhoid, smallpox, measles, bubonic plague, cholera, influenza, ergot poisoning and a host of animal diseases.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-early-greeks-believe-sickness-happened>Why did the early Greeks believe sickness happened?</h2>
<p>Early on the ancient Greeks believed that illnesses were “divine punishments” and that healing was a “gift from the Gods”. It was recognized that the mind played a role in healing, or that it might also be the sole basis for the illness. Ancient Greek medicine began to revolve around the theory of humors.</p>
<h2 id=is-ebola-ancient>Is Ebola ancient?</h2>
<p>The research does not address the age of the modern-day Ebolavirus. Instead, it shows that Ebola and Marburg are each members of ancient evolutionary lines, and that these two viruses last shared a common ancestor sometime prior to 16-23 million years ago.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-ancient-greeks-treat-diseases>How did ancient Greeks treat diseases?</h2>
<p>Surgery. Ancient Greek doctors performed some surgical procedures on patients. A doctor might set a broken bone, amputate an arm or a leg, drain fluid from the lungs, or perform a procedure known as bloodletting.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-plague-in-athens>What caused plague in Athens?</h2>
<p>plague’ in Athens in the 5th century BCE was caused by moldy food containing immunosuppressive mycotoxins, including the irritant T-2 toxin produced by certain Fusarium micro-fungi. Attica, a small hilly, coastal city-state, had to import its cereal grains from overseas.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-1995-epidemic-began>Where did the 1995 epidemic began?</h2>
<p>In 1995, an outbreak began with a charcoal maker in the forests near the city of Kikwit in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This outbreak led to a reported 315 cases and 250 deaths. The virus spread through families and hospitals but came to a stop when healthcare staff used face masks, gloves and gowns.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-health-issues-in-ancient-greece>Are there any health issues in ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>Health issues in Ancient Greece. There is a whole list of diseases that we still have today that were present in the Ancient Greek times. Here is a list of a few of the diseases: – Diabetes – Acne – Cholesterol problems – Allergies – Migraine – Plague All of them except the Plague, we still have today and we have found cures to them,…</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-ancient-greeks-find-a-cure-for-disease>Why did the ancient Greeks find a cure for Disease?</h2>
<p>The ancient Greeks couldn’t find a cure but did come up with the miasmatic theory of disease. They found out that the reason why people got this disease was because of air pollution and prevented further contamination by using good hygiene habits.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-typhoid-fever-so-common-in-ancient-greece>Why was typhoid fever so common in ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>The grip of typhoid fever on the Athenians was so strong that it may have helped the Spartan takeover of the city. This effectively brought an end to the Golden Age of Pericles that once symbolized Athenian dominance over the ancient world (along with death of Pericles himself who also succumbed to the epidemic).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-common-disease-in-ancient-europe>What was the most common disease in ancient Europe?</h2>
<p>Bubonic Plague. Then came the Black Death in the spring of 1348 – a plague so lethal that in the next three years, it had wiped out about 25% to 50% of the entire Europe’s population. No one was prepared for that degree of impending annihilation, neither anyone had an adequate understanding of the disease.</p>
