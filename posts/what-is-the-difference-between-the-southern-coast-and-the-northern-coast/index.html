<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-the-southern-coast-and-the-northern-coast>What is the difference between the southern coast and the northern coast?</h2>
<p>The northern Coast Ranges are generally higher than the southern Coast Ranges. North-south trending valleys and ridges which lie along a series of parallel faults and folds make up the Coast Ranges. The Russian River (northern CR) and Salinas River (southern CR) are major rivers of the Coast Ranges.</p>
<h2 id=what-separates-northern-and-southern-california>What separates Northern and Southern California?</h2>
<p>The dividing line between Northern and Southern California is a matter of opinion. The Tehachapi Mountains are often suggested as a natural dividing line, but they’re not a perfect border.</p>
<h2 id=is-southern-california-warmer-than-northern-california>Is Southern California warmer than Northern California?</h2>
<p>Southern regions: They also have warmer average temperatures than central and northern areas.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-coastal-areas-of-southern-california>Where are the coastal areas of Southern California?</h2>
<p>However, some sources include the coastal half of Ventura, western part of Riverside, and southwestern part of San Bernardino Counties, and the northwestern corner of Baja California, because of their proximity to the Pacific Coast and because they are in the same bio-region and watershed.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-southernmost-county-in-southern-california>Which is the southernmost county in Southern California?</h2>
<p>When the state is divided into two areas (northern and southern California), the term southern California usually refers to the 10 southernmost counties of the state. This definition coincides neatly with the county lines at 35° 47′ 28″ North latitude, which form the northern borders of San Luis Obispo , Kern , and San Bernardino counties.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-part-of-spain-is-similar-to-southern-california>Which is part of Spain is similar to Southern California?</h2>
<p>Costa de la Luz is this part of the coast of Andalusia, which stretches west of Cape Tarifa and Gibraltar, on the Atlantic coast. This part of Spain is even more similar to the extreme south of California.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-climate-similar-to-southern-california>Where is the climate similar to Southern California?</h2>
<p>Similar to Southern California, cool ocean currents run along the coast of Costa de la Luz. The ocean water temperature does not differ from that in La Jolla, California and is about 16°C in winter and about 22°C in summer. Many people say that nowhere in Europe has such a warm climate as in Southern California.</p>
