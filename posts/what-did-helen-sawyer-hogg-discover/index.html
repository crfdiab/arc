<h2 id=what-did-helen-sawyer-hogg-discover>What did Helen Sawyer Hogg discover?</h2>
<p>Recognized internationally for her research on globular star clusters, Helen Sawyer Hogg significantly advanced astronomers’ understanding of the location and age of stars as well as the origins and evolution of our galaxy, the Milky Way.</p>

<p>87 years (1905–1993)<br>
Helen Sawyer Hogg/Age at death</p>
<h2 id=did-helen-hogg-have-kids>Did Helen Hogg have kids?</h2>
<p>Helen Hogg continued to work for free until she was offered a position as a research assistant in 1936. As Hogg’s professional career grew, so too did her family. In 1936 she gave birth to son David and in 1937 James was born. Hogg continued her professional activities even as she raised her three children.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-annie-jump-cannon-make-the-world-a-better-place>How did Annie Jump Cannon make the world a better place?</h2>
<p>Known as the “census taker of the sky,” Annie Jump Cannon was a brilliant astronomer that revolutionized the way scientists classify stars. Not only did she develop the important Harvard spectral system, she also classified about 350,000 stars manually.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-globular-cluster>What is the meaning of globular cluster?</h2>
<p>Globular clusters are tightly packed, symmetrical collections of stars, orbiting mostly in the extended star halos surrounding most spiral galaxies. Globular clusters contain some of the oldest stars in a galaxy and are thought to have formed early in its history.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-globular-clusters-are-there>How many globular clusters are there?</h2>
<p>150<br>
There are about 150 known globular clusters in the Milky Way galaxy, according to Georgia State University’s HyperPhysics website. Most are estimated to be at least 10 billion years old, and contain some of the oldest stars in the galaxy.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-annie-jump-cannon-lose-her-hearing>How did Annie Jump Cannon lose her hearing?</h2>
<p>Cannon was a child she had a cold. The cold caused Ms. Cannon to become deaf. Every year she could hear less and less until she couldn t hear anymore.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-stars-did-annie-jump-cannon-classify>How many stars did Annie Jump Cannon classify?</h2>
<p>350,000 stars<br>
Known as the “census taker of the sky,” Annie Jump Cannon was a brilliant astronomer that revolutionized the way scientists classify stars. Not only did she develop the important Harvard spectral system, she also classified about 350,000 stars manually.</p>
<h2 id=what-if-we-lived-in-a-globular-cluster>What if we lived in a globular cluster?</h2>
<p>To live on an Earth in a globular cluster would mean that the cluster’s stars (if they were like our Sun) would combine to create a night sky at around 20 times brighter than Earth’s night sky at full Moon.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-our-galaxy-cluster-called>What is our galaxy cluster called?</h2>
<p>The Laniakea Supercluster is the supercluster that contains the Virgo Cluster, Local Group, and by extension on the latter, our galaxy; the Milky Way. It contains the Local Group with our galaxy, the Milky Way. It also contains the Virgo Cluster near its center, and is sometimes called the Local Supercluster.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-globular-clusters-not-collapse>Why do globular clusters not collapse?</h2>
<p>What keeps these clusters from collapsing is the angular momentum of the stars as they orbit the cluster’s center of mass. It’s the same physics that keeps the solar system from collapsing.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-helen-hogg-and-what-did-she-do>Who was Helen Hogg and what did she do?</h2>
<p>(1905-93) A well-known DDO astronomer (specializing in globular cluster variables) and popularizer of astronomy. She wrote an astronomy column in The Toronto Star for 30 years. Served as President (1957-58) and Honorary President (1977-81) of the Society. HELEN HOGG (1905-93) was born Helen Sawyer in Lowell, Massachusetts.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-helen-sawyer-hogg-born-and-raised>Where was Helen Sawyer Hogg born and raised?</h2>
<p>Born in Lowell, Massachusetts on August 1, 1905, Helen was the second daughter of banker Edward Everett Sawyer and his wife Carrier Sprague Sawyer who was previously a schoolteacher.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-awards-did-helen-sawyer-hogg-win>What kind of awards did Helen Sawyer Hogg win?</h2>
<p>Helen Sawyer Hogg has been recognized publicly with numerous awards and accolades. She won the Annie J. Cannon Prize from the American Astronomical Society (1950) and was the first Canadian and the second woman to win the Rittenhouse Silver Medal (1967).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-telescope-did-helen-sawyer-hogg-use>What kind of telescope did Helen Sawyer Hogg use?</h2>
<p>Hogg began taking photos of variable stars with the 72-inch reflecting telescope, cataloguing the cyclical changes in the brightness of the variable stars. At the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, Hogg found 132 new variable stars in the globular cluster Messier 2.</p>
