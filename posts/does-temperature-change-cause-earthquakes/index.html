<h2 id=does-temperature-change-cause-earthquakes>Does temperature change cause earthquakes?</h2>
<p>In fact, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, the only correlation that’s been noted between earthquakes and weather is that large changes in atmospheric pressure caused by major storms like hurricanes have been shown to occasionally trigger what are known as “slow earthquakes,” which release energy over …</p>
<h2 id=why-does-it-rain-after-an-earthquake>Why does it rain after an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Popular Answers (1) Obviously, an earthquake cannot cause rainfalls. If prolonged rainfalls event follow or coincide with an earthquake, now it is clear that water is an augmenting factor for such mass movement events.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-an-earthquake-affect-the-weather-on-earth>How does an earthquake affect the weather on Earth?</h2>
<p>The earthquake itself will not impact weather, but if you trace the earth quake back to original causes, such as continental drift, plate boundaries and breeches in the earth’s crust, especially deep in the oceans, where the crust is thinner, the result can be mantle heat being released into the oceans.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-an-earthquake-in-one-place-change-the-earth>How does an earthquake in one place change the Earth?</h2>
<p>An earthquake in one place can cause a series of events that resonate out and change entire environments that are nowhere near the site of the actual earthquake. Earthquakes are caused by either volcanic activity or shifting of massive tectonic plates underneath the surface of the earth.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-an-earthquake-in-the-united-states>What causes an earthquake in the United States?</h2>
<p>Is there earthquake weather? In the 4th Century B.C., Aristotle proposed that earthquakes were caused by winds trapped in subterranean caves. Small tremors were thought to have been caused by air pushing on the cavern roofs, and large ones by the air breaking the surface.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-myth-of-earthquakes-come-about>How did the myth of earthquakes come about?</h2>
<p>The myth stems from the Greek philosopher Aristotle, who proposed in the 4 th century B.C. that earthquakes were caused by trapped winds escaping from subterranean caves. He believed the large amounts of air trapped underground would make weather on Earth’s surface before a quake hot and calm.</p>
