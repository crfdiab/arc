<h2 id=what-did-colonial-america-use-for-money>What did colonial America use for money?</h2>
<p>Colonial currency. There were three general types of money in the Colonies of British America: the specie (coins), printed paper money and trade-based commodity money. Commodity money was used when cash (coins and paper money) were scarce.</p>
<h2 id=what-role-did-wealth-play-in-the-colonies>What role did wealth play in the colonies?</h2>
<p>Middle Colonies Many merchants became wealthy by providing goods to the agricultural population; many of this group came to dominate the society of seaport cities. Large-scale farmers and merchants became wealthy, while farmers with smaller farms and artisans only made enough for subsistence.</p>
<h2 id=what-money-was-used-in-1776>What money was used in 1776?</h2>
<p>Continental Currency dollar coin<br>
The Continental Currency dollar coin (also known as Continental dollar coin, Fugio dollar, or Franklin dollar) was the first pattern coin struck for the United States. The coins were minted in 1776 and examples were made on pewter, brass, and silver planchets.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-1776-coin-worth>How much is a 1776 coin worth?</h2>
<p>The standard 1776-1976 silver dollar is worth around $18 in MS 63 choice uncirculated condition. In MS 65 gem uncirculated condition the price rises to around $22. The 1776-1976 proof silver dollar is worth around $20 in PR 65 condition. There were 4,000,000 proof coins minted.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-money-mean-in-the-american-colonies>What did money mean in the American colonies?</h2>
<p>In fact, it simply means £100 of whatever was accepted as money in New York, according to the valuations prevailing in New York.6 Such subtle misunderstandings have led some historians to overestimate the ubiquity of paper money in colonial America.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-currency-used-in-colonial-times>What was the currency used in colonial times?</h2>
<p>The word “currency” today refers narrowly to paper money, but that wasn’t so in colonial times. “The Word, Currency ,” Hugh Vance wrote in 1740, “is in common Use in the Plantations . . . and signifies Silver passing current either by Weight or Tale.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-paper-currency-important-to-the-american-revolution>Why was paper currency important to the American Revolution?</h2>
<p>Colonial currency. That prohibition created tension between the colonies and the mother country and has sometimes been seen as a contributing factor in the coming of the American Revolution. After much lobbying, Parliament amended the act in 1773, permitting the colonies to issue paper currency as legal tender for public debts.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-effect-of-the-depreciation-of-colonial-currency>What was the effect of the depreciation of colonial currency?</h2>
<p>This depreciation of colonial currency was harmful to creditors in Great Britain when colonists paid their debts with money that had lost value. The British Parliament passed several Currency Acts to regulate the paper money issued by the colonies. The Act of 1751 restricted the issue of paper money in New England.</p>
