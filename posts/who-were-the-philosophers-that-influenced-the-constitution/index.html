<h2 id=who-were-the-philosophers-that-influenced-the-constitution>Who were the philosophers that influenced the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Enlightenment philosophers John Locke, Charles Montesquieu, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau all developed theories of government in which some or even all the people would govern. These thinkers had a profound effect on the American and French revolutions and the democratic governments that they produced.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-philosophy-behind-the-constitution>What was the philosophy behind the Constitution?</h2>
<p>The guiding values of the Indian Constitution may be summarized as comprising equality, freedom, secularism, socialism and internationalism. These values have laid down the parameters within which the Indian constitution has to function.</p>
<h2 id=which-philosopher-influenced-the-founding-fathers>Which philosopher influenced the Founding Fathers?</h2>
<p>Locke<br>
The founders of the United States were deeply influenced by republicanism, by Locke, and by the optimism of the European Enlightenment.</p>
<h2 id=why-it-is-important-to-study-the-philosophy-of-constitution>Why it is important to study the philosophy of constitution?</h2>
<p>Why in Need? A political philosophy approach to the constitution is needed not only to find out the moral content expressed in it and to evaluate its claims but possibly to use it to arbitrate between varying interpretations of the many core values in our polity.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-political-philosophy-of-our-constitution>What is the political philosophy of our Constitution?</h2>
<p>This philosophy of government incorporated three major political doctrines: natural rights, republicanism, and constitutionalism. These ideas were part of the common intellectual currency of eighteenth century America.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-functions-of-a-constitution>What are the functions of a Constitution?</h2>
<p>The Constitution has three main functions. First it creates a national government consisting of a legislative, an executive, and a judicial branch, with a system of checks and balances among the three branches. Second, it divides power between the federal government and the states.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-philosophers-who-write-about-education>Are there any philosophers who write about education?</h2>
<p>What makes the field even more amorphous is the existence of works on educational topics, written by well-regarded philosophers who have made major contributions to their discipline; these educational reflections have little or no philosophical content, illustrating the truth that philosophers do not always write philosophy.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-people-believe-the-constitution-was-divinely-inspired>Where did people believe the constitution was divinely inspired?</h2>
<p>Earlier in his career he had taught at the University of Utah College of Law. There he met many Latter-day Saint law students. “They all seemed to believe that the Constitution was divinely inspired,” he said, “but none of them could ever tell me what this meant or how it affected their interpretation of the Constitution.”</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-write-your-own-philosophy-paper>Do you have to write your own philosophy paper?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, the entire task of an assignment will be simply to explain an argument originated by somebody else, rather than to provide an argument for your own thesis. While you will not always be expected to provide your own completely original arguments or theories in philosophy papers, you must always practice philosophy.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-oconnor-write-his-introduction-to-philosophy-of-education>When did O’Connor write his introduction to philosophy of Education?</h2>
<p>O’Connor published An Introduction to Philosophy of Education (1957) in which, among other things, he argued that the word “theory” as it is used in educational contexts is merely a courtesy title, for educational theories are nothing like what bear this title in the natural sciences.</p>
