<h2 id=is-fujairah-a-nice-place-to-live>Is Fujairah a nice place to live?</h2>
<p>Fujairah is a lovely place that lots of expats from the other Emirates visit for a weekend break but there are more and more expats moving to Fujairah as the industry there grows. Fujairah is the only Emirate of the UAE that is almost totally mountainous.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-poorest-emirate>What is the poorest Emirate?</h2>

Ajman is the smallest and poorest of the United Arab Emirates, the only one where nobody is even looking for oil, let alone producing it. Many of its estimated 30,000 residents still live in modest one story houses, scattered about the sands and topped by traditional gulf wind towers.</p>
<h2 id=is-fujairah-cooler-than-dubai>Is Fujairah cooler than Dubai?</h2>
<p>The cool factor: Located on the east coast of the UAE, Fujairah is the country’s most mountainous emirate, meaning it enjoys more seasonable weather. For instance, there’s more rainfall here than in Dubai, and higher altitudes result in lower temperatures.</p>
