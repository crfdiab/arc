<h2 id=what-challenges-did-the-continental-army-face-in-the-early-years-of-the-american-revolution>What challenges did the Continental Army face in the early years of the American Revolution?</h2>
<p>The Continental Army also faced many disadvantages, such as a constant shortage of money, weapons, gun powder, food, clothing and medicine.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-it-so-difficult-for-washington-to-maintain-a-colonial-army>Why was it so difficult for Washington to maintain a colonial army?</h2>
<p>Explanation: In the first year of fighting, each colony was supposed to send, equip and pay enough soldiers to man Washington’s army. The colonies squabbled among themselves over how many to send and how to pay them.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-articles-of-confederation-allow-an-army>Did the Articles of Confederation allow an army?</h2>
<p>Constitution Daily The Articles of Confederation, which were finally ratified in 1781, established the ability to raise troops for the common defense of the United States. (It also allowed individual states to declare war under certain conditions.)</p>
<h2 id=why-was-keeping-a-continental-army-difficult-under-the-articles-of-confederation>Why was keeping a Continental Army difficult under the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>The main reason why keeping a continental army was difficult under the Articles of Confederation, was because “Congress could not force states to pay for troops’ needs,” since under the Articles, Congress had no power to tax the states. Rate!</p>
<h2 id=what-was-a-weakness-of-the-articles-of-confederation>What was a weakness of the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>The Articles unified the states, which lacked a strong, central government. Although the Articles of Confederation had several successes, it created far more weaknesses and failures. First of all, under the Articles, there was no executive head of the government.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-the-articles-of-confederation-or-the-united-states>Which is better the Articles of Confederation or the United States?</h2>
<p>Even though the government under the Articles of Confederation was very weak, it was still more democratic because it gave more rights and power to the states. The Articles unified the states, which lacked a strong, central government.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-articles-of-confederation-lead-to-the-constitution>How did the Articles of Confederation lead to the Constitution?</h2>
<p>The Articles created a loose confederation of sovereign states and a weak government, leaving most of the power within the state governments. The need for a stronger Federal government soon became apparent and eventually led to the Constitutional Convention in 1787.</p>
