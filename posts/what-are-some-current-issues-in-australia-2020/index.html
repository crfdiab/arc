<p>As COVID-19 has spread, business disruption and financial market dislocation have followed contagion, prompting a rash of economic forecast downgrades.</p>

<li>It starts with growth.</li>

<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-issues-that-may-concern-australian-citizens>What are some of the issues that may concern Australian citizens?</h2>
<p>Economic Issues led by Unemployment, Cost of living, Economic problems, Poverty and the gap between rich and poor, Homelessness/ Lack of housing and Housing affordability were mentioned by almost 34% of Australians as the most important problems facing Australia.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-issues-that-australia-faces-in-the-future>What are some of the issues that Australia faces in the future?</h2>
<p>An ageing population, escalating pressures in the health system and climate change pose long-term challenges for Australia’s economic growth, living standards and government finances. Failure to act now to tackle intergenerational challenges will result in severe economic, fiscal and environmental consequences.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-influence-in-australia>What is the main influence in Australia?</h2>
<p>The culture of Australia is primarily a Western culture, derived from Britain but also influenced by the unique geography of Australia, the cultural input of Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and other Australian people. The British colonization of Australia began in 1788, and waves of multi-ethnic migration followed.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-problem-facing-the-youth-today>What is the biggest problem facing the youth today?</h2>
<p>The top 10 challenges facing young people today</p>
<ul>
<li>Issues related to body image.</li>
<li>Family problems.</li>
<li>Substance abuse.</li>
<li>Pressures of materialism.</li>
<li>Lack of affordable housing.</li>
<li>Negative stereotyping.</li>
<li>Pressures of 24-hour social networking.</li>
<li>Crime.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-is-australias-dirt-so-red>Why is Australia’s dirt so red?</h2>
<p>In warmer climates, like Australia, chemical weathering is more common. Chemical weathering occurs when conditions change the materials that make up the rock and soil. As the rust expands, it weakens the rock and helps break it apart. The oxides produced through this process give the ground its reddish hue.</p>

<h2 id=seeking-protection--refugees-and-asylum-seekers-why-are-aussies-so-laid-back>Seeking protection – refugees and asylum seekers. Why are Aussies so laid-back?</h2>
<p>The tough conditions of settler times also played a part in Australians’ dry, self-deprecating and sarcastic sense of humour. This, according to Dr Luckins, along with an abundance of leisure time plus favourable climate, all contribute to Australians’ relaxed attitude.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-environmental-problems-in-australia>Why are there so many environmental problems in Australia?</h2>
<p>Climate change, and introduced plants and animals (invasives), are the agents of the radical changes that are tearing through Australia’s environment. The result? Dramatic declines in the distribution and abundance of many species, with natural resources such as water now going scarce. What is WWF doing about the problems?</p>
<h2 id=how-are-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-people-affected>How are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people affected?</h2>
<p>There are still specific current social, political and economic issues that are affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They are highly deprived of resources and are not promoted at a significant level.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-anglo-american-helping-to-protect-the-environment>How is Anglo American helping to protect the environment?</h2>
<p>Therefore, our vision is to reduce freshwater abstraction in water-scarce regions by 50%. We can’t operate without water and 70% of our mines are in places where it’s scarce. This means that looking after water is a significant challenge, as without careful management, mining can have a negative impact on its quality.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-vision-of-the-anglo-american-corporation>What is the vision of the Anglo American corporation?</h2>
<p>Our vision is to deliver net positive impact (NPI) across Anglo American through implementing the mitigation hierarchy and investment in biodiversity stewardship Our vision is to deliver net positive impact (NPI) across Anglo American through implementing the mitigation hierarchy and investment in biodiversity stewardship.</p>
