<h2 id=why-is-nz-being-called-aotearoa>Why is NZ being called Aotearoa?</h2>
<p>“Aotearoa” means “land of the long white cloud” in te reo and has a contested history as the widely used te reo name for New Zealand. National ministers used the word Aotearoa frequently while last in Government.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-aotearoa-mean>What does Aotearoa mean?</h2>
<p>Aotearoa is the Maori name for New Zealand, though it seems at first to have been used for the North Island only. It seems the voyagers to New Zealand were guided during the day by a long white cloud and at night by a long bright cloud.</p>
<h2 id=who-named-nz-aotearoa>Who named NZ Aotearoa?</h2>
<p>Johannes Anderson, in the same year, published Māori Life in Aotea. The now common specific ‘translation’ of Aotearoa as ‘the land of the long white cloud’ probably became more established from the 1920s or 30s. Both Bracken and Reeves are commonly credited with first inventing the word Aotearoa.</p>
<h2 id=what-aroha-means>What Aroha means?</h2>
<p>Love<br>
Aroha means Love. Aroha is a compound word, the parts of Aroha include Aro, Ro, Hā, Oha. These words give many layers of meaning offering a profound message of love and connection. ARO is thought, life principle, paying attention, to focus on, to face or front. RO is inner, within, introspection.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-māori-land-in-nz>Where did the first Māori land in NZ?</h2>
<p>According to Māori, the first explorer to reach New Zealand was Kupe. Using the stars and ocean currents as his navigational guides, he ventured across the Pacific on his waka hourua (voyaging canoe) from his ancestral Polynesian homeland of Hawaiki.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-mihi-whakatau>What is a mihi Whakatau?</h2>
<p>Mihi whakatau is the Māori term used to describe a formal speech of welcome and is undertaken by a Māori representative of the University. Mihi whakatau is traditionally used for welcoming, introductions, openings and general purpose which take place off the marae.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-native-trees-in-new-zealand>Are there any native trees in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>There is a wide variety of native trees, adapted to all the various micro- climates in New Zealand.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-people-of-new-zealand-get-their-name>How did the people of New Zealand get their name?</h2>
<p>There are cognate words in most Polynesian languages, all deriving from Proto-Polynesian * ma (a)qoli, which has the reconstructed meaning “true, real, genuine”. Early visitors from Europe to New Zealand generally referred to the indigenous inhabitants as “New Zealanders” or as “natives”.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-flora-does-new-zealand-have>What kind of flora does New Zealand have?</h2>
<p>The native flora of New Zealand is unique as it evolved in isolation for millions of years. 80% of our trees, ferns and flowering plants are endemic (found only in New Zealand).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-birds-live-in-new-zealand>What kind of birds live in New Zealand?</h2>
