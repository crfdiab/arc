<h2 id=what-is-the-main-crop-in-northern-china>What is the main crop in northern China?</h2>
<p>Rice, China’s most important crop, is dominant in the southern provinces, many of which yield two harvests per year. In North China wheat is of the greatest importance, while in the central provinces wheat and rice vie with each other for the top place.</p>
<h2 id=what-grain-does-china-grow>What grain does China grow?</h2>
<p>Rice, maize and wheat are the three major crops, and the production of these three crops accounts for more than 90% of China’s total food production.</p>
<h2 id=what-grain-was-most-important-to-northern-chinese-agriculture>What grain was most important to northern Chinese agriculture?</h2>
<p>The first farmers of northern China primarily grew millet—a drought-tolerant, small-seeded grain in the grass family that today is mostly grown in East Asia and is used for birdseed in the United States—starting as early as 11,500 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-major-grain-crop-in-china>Which is the major grain crop in China?</h2>
<p>Paddy rice is the major grain crop in China, grown mainly in the Yangtze River valley and southern China, and on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-do-they-eat-in-northern-china>What kind of food do they eat in northern China?</h2>
<p>In the north, especially in Inner Mongolia, there are large grasslands, where pastoral people live. Their food features dairy products (like cheese, butter, and yoghurt), beef, and grassland game. There are less fresh vegetables available because of the cold weather.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-corn-and-soybeans-grown-in-china>Where are corn and soybeans grown in China?</h2>
<p>AGRICULTURE. The output of corn, grown in the provinces of northeastern, northern and southwestern China, accounts for one fourth of the total grain output. Soybeans are grown on the Northeast China Plain and the plains along the Yellow and Huaihe rivers. Sweet potatoes are grown widely in China, but mainly in the Pearl River valley,…</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-cash-crops-grown-in-china>Where are the cash crops grown in China?</h2>
<p>AGRICULTURE. Cash crops include cotton, peanuts, rape, sesame, sugarcane, tea, tobacco, mulberry and fruit. Cotton is grown mainly along the Yellow River and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Manas River valley in Xinjiang. Peanuts are grown in Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi and Liaoning.</p>
