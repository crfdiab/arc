<h2 id=what-evidence-found-on-africa-and-south-america-supports-the-hypothesis-of-continental-drift>What evidence found on Africa and South America supports the hypothesis of continental drift?</h2>
<p>Wegener used fossil evidence to support his continental drift hypothesis. The fossils of these organisms are found on lands that are now far apart. Grooves and rock deposits left by ancient glaciers are found today on different continents very close to the equator.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-evidence-in-support-of-the-continental-drift>What are the evidence in support of the continental drift?</h2>
<p>Wegener then assembled an impressive amount of evidence to show that Earth’s continents were once connected in a single supercontinent. Wegener knew that fossil plants and animals such as mesosaurs, a freshwater reptile found only South America and Africa during the Permian period, could be found on many continents.</p>
<h2 id=how-ancient-glacial-deposits-in-africa-india-australia-and-south-america-support-the-idea-of-continental-drift>How ancient glacial deposits in Africa India Australia and South America support the idea of continental drift?</h2>
<p>How do ancient glacial deposits in Africa, India, Australia, and South America support the idea of continental drift? The deposits indicate the continents were once located near the poles. Wegener couldn’t explain the forces behind the moving continents.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-alfred-wegeners-hypothesis-for-continental-drift-rejected>Why was Alfred Wegener’s hypothesis for continental drift rejected?</h2>
<p>The main reason that Wegener’s hypothesis was not accepted was because he suggested no mechanism for moving the continents. He thought the force of Earth’s spin was sufficient to cause continents to move, but geologists knew that rocks are too strong for this to be true.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-important-glacial-terms-related-to-continental-drift>What are some important glacial terms related to continental drift?</h2>
<p>Wegener used the distribution of specific rock types to determine the distribution of climate zones in the geologic past. For example, glacial till and striations (scratches on the rock), sand dunes, and coral reefs, indicate polar, desert, and tropical climates, respectively.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-layers-of-continental-drift-found>Where are the layers of continental drift found?</h2>
<p>Layers of ____ ___ found in Africa, South America, India, and Australia help to support the continental drift hypothesis. glacial till According to the theory of plate tectonics, the</p>
<h2 id=how-are-mountain-belts-support-the-continental-drift-hypothesis>How are mountain belts support the continental drift hypothesis?</h2>
<p>One type of evidence that supports Wegener’s continental drift hypothesis is the existence of ___ that begin on one continent and contineu on another. mountain belts Layers of ____ ___ found in Africa, South America, India, and Australia help to support the continental drift hypothesis.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-glacial-scars-evidence-of-continental-drift>How are glacial scars evidence of continental drift?</h2>
<p>GLACIAL SCARS Wegener found evidence of glacial scars left behind by giant ice sheets from the same time period in Southern Africa, India, Australia and South America. 4. GLACIAL SCARS Then… Now… WHAT COULD MOVE THE CONTINENTS?</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-examples-of-continental-drift-in-africa>What are some examples of continental drift in Africa?</h2>
<p>Africa, for example, will eventually split along the Great Rift Valley system. What is now a single continent will emerge as two—one on the African plate and the other on the smaller Somali plate. The new Somali continent will be mostly oceanic, with the Horn of Africa and Madagascar its largest landmasses.</p>
