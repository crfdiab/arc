<p>While he never threw a no-hitter, Carlton pitched six one–hitters, 11th most in baseball history. Carlton had 90 career balks, the most in history. Carlton was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994 with 95.82% of the vote, one of the highest percentages ever.</p>

After the Phillies activated him from the DL, on September 28, he helped the Phillies take over first place in the National League East by striking out 13 Washington Nationals over 8 innings in a 6–0 win.</p>

<h2 id=when-did-cole-hamels-play-for-the-red-barons>When did Cole Hamels play for the Red Barons?</h2>
<p>In 2006, a healthy Hamels started again at Clearwater, and after a brief stint in Reading, he was promoted to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons of the Class AAA International League. In three games at Scranton, he struck out 36 batters while giving up only one walk and one run.</p>
