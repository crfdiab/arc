<h2 id=who-went-with-columbus-on-his-voyage>Who went with Columbus on his voyage?</h2>

<h2 id=who-was-on-the-first-voyage-of-christopher-columbus>Who was on the first voyage of Christopher Columbus?</h2>
<p>Of the four voyages of Columbus, only the crew of the first voyage is completely known. Alice Bache Gould spent decades combing various archives in Spain, eventually accounting for each of the 87 crewmen of the Niña, Pinta, and Santa Maria.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-evidence-that-africans-sailed-to-americas-before-columbus>Is there evidence that Africans sailed to Americas before Columbus?</h2>
