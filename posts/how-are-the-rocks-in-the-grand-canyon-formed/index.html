<p>1 A Million-Year Journey. The Grand Canyon was not formed by a single event in history, but over the course of millions of years, which shaped the rocks into the majestic 2 The Colorado River Course Change. The river actually split into two parts. 3 Erosion Steps In. …</p>

<p>How Was The Grand Canyon Formed? The Grand Canyon was not formed by a single event in history, but over the course of millions of years. Scientists and geologists believe that there was no canyon in that area around 35 million years ago. The Colorado River flowed across a vast plain.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-colorado-river-come-to-be>How did the Colorado River come to be?</h2>
<p>Some exciting natural scenic attractions among the Colorado River include Horseshoe Bend, Davis Dam, Lee’s Ferry, and the Grand Canyon. So how did this enormous river one day come to be? Read further to find out. 75 million years ago, the Rocky Mountains began to take shape out of the flat seascape.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-grand-canyon-split-into-two-parts>How did the Grand Canyon split into two parts?</h2>
<p>The river actually split into two parts. The part of the river to the right side of the plateau (see the image below) was diverted in a southeastern direction and began flowing into the Gulf of Mexico, rather than into the Pacific Ocean, where it flowed before the Kaibab Plateau began rising.</p>

<h2 id=when-did-people-first-come-to-the-grand-canyon>When did people first come to the Grand Canyon?</h2>
<p>Scientists estimate the canyon may have formed 5 to 6 million years ago when the Colorado River began to cut a channel through layers of rock. Humans have inhabited the area in and around the canyon since the last Ice Age. The first Europeans to reach the Grand Canyon were Spanish explorers in the 1540s.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-cutting-of-the-grand-canyon-occur>When did the cutting of the Grand Canyon occur?</h2>
<p>The cutting of the mile-deep Grand Canyon by the Colorado River is an event of relatively recent geologic history that began not more than six million years ago, when the river began following its present course. The Colorado River’s rapid velocity and large volume and the great amounts of mud, sand,…</p>
