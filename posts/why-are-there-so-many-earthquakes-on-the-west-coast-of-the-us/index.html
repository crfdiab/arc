<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-earthquakes-on-the-west-coast-of-the-us>Why are there so many earthquakes on the west coast of the US?</h2>
<p>More Earthquakes in the West The western United States lies along the boundaries of major tectonic plates that make up the Earth’s crust—the North American Plate and the ocean plates to the west. These plates are moving against each other, breaking up the crust along many faults like the San Andreas Fault.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-west-coast-california-more-likely-to-have-an-earthquake>Why is the west coast California more likely to have an earthquake?</h2>
<p>The geologic conditions and plate tectonic setting in much of the Western U.S. has resulted in the region being underlain by relatively thin crust and having high heat flow, both of which can favor relatively high deformation rates and active faulting.</p>
<h2 id=which-us-coast-is-more-prone-to-earthquakes>Which US coast is more prone to earthquakes?</h2>
<p>A few areas of the midwestern and eastern United States are more prone to earthquakes than others. The most earthquake-prone areas include Charleston, South Carolina, eastern Massachusetts, the St. Lawrence River area, and the central Mississippi River Valley.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-most-earthquakes-occur-in-california>Why do most earthquakes occur in California?</h2>
<p>California is so prone to earthquakes because it lies on the San Andreas Fault. The San Andreas Fault extends roughly 800 miles through the US state. Faults are areas where two tectonic plates come together.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-more-earthquakes-on-the-west-coast>Are there more earthquakes on the west coast?</h2>
<p>More Earthquakes in the West. The western United States lies along the boundaries of major tectonic plates that make up the Earth’s crust—the North American Plate and the ocean plates to the west.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-earthquakes-in-the-united-states>Why are there so many earthquakes in the United States?</h2>
<p>This region of the United States has been tectonically active since the supercontinent Pangea broke up roughly 200 million years ago, and in large part because it is close to the western boundary of the North American plate.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-california-earthquake-compared-to-the-east-coast-earthquake>How big is the California earthquake compared to the east coast earthquake?</h2>
<p>The region that felt this earthquake is about the same size as that of the much larger California event, which released about 700 times more energy. Scientists are researching a variety of factors that influence regional differences in the intensity and effects of earthquakes.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-more-earthquakes-east-of-the-rocky-mountains>Are there more earthquakes east of the Rocky Mountains?</h2>
<p>Earthquakes east of the Rocky Mountains can cause noticeable ground shaking at much farther distances than comparably-sized earthquakes in the West. On March 27th, 1964, the second largest instrumentally recorded earthquake worldwide rocked southern Alaska for 4 to 5 minutes.</p>
