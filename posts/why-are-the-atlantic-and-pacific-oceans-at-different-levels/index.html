<h2 id=why-are-the-atlantic-and-pacific-oceans-at-different-levels>Why are the Atlantic and Pacific oceans at different levels?</h2>
<p>The difference in density and sea level of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans may stem from the difference in latitude of the southern tips of America, Africa, and Australia, and the constriction of the west wind drift at Drake Strait.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-bodies-of-water-are-connected-by-the-strait-of-hormuz>What two bodies of water are connected by the Strait of Hormuz?</h2>
<p>The Strait of Hormuz, located between Oman and Iran, connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-ferdinand-magellan-able-to-find-the-pacific-ocean>How was Ferdinand Magellan able to find the Pacific ocean?</h2>
<p>On September 20, 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain in an effort to find a western sea route to the rich Spice Islands of Indonesia. In command of five ships and 270 men, Magellan sailed to West Africa and then to Brazil, where he searched the South American coast for a strait that would take him to the Pacific.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-two-worst-diseases-that-killed-the-canal-workers>What were the two worst diseases that killed the canal workers?</h2>
<p>What were the two worst diseases that killed the canal workers? Malaria and Yellow Fever12.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-called-a-channel-that-connecting-two-bodies-of-water>What do you called a channel that connecting two bodies of water?</h2>
<p>strait<br>
A strait is a naturally formed, narrow, typically navigable waterway that connects two larger bodies of water. Most commonly it is a channel of water that lies between two land masses.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-people-start-exploring-the-pacific-ocean>When did people start exploring the Pacific Ocean?</h2>
<p>History of Oceanography. About 30,000 years ago, human cultures along the western coastline of the Pacific Ocean started to migrate eastward across the great expanse of the Pacific Ocean. The people who lived around the Mediterranean Sea began exploring this nearly landlocked sea several thousand years ago.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-first-oceanographic-expedition>What was the purpose of the first oceanographic expedition?</h2>
<p>It was the first expedition organized specifically to gather data on a wide range of ocean features, including ocean temperatures seawater chemistry, currents, marine life, and the geology of the seafloor.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-ancients-think-of-the-ocean>What did the Ancients think of the ocean?</h2>
<p>They realized that although ocean water didn’t look different from river water, it was salty and undrinkable. Their experiences and understanding of the oceans were passed down over thousands of years from generation to generation in myths and legends.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-the-atlantic-and-pacific-oceans-not-mix>Why do the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans not mix?</h2>
<p>Well, you’ll be amazed at how vivid the borders between them are! The border between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans is like a line between 2 worlds. It looks as if the two oceans meet at an invisible wall which does not let them flow into each other and mix their waters. Why on Earth does it happen?</p>
