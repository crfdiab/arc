<h2 id=where-do-creoles-live>Where do Creoles live?</h2>
<p>Creoles may be of any race and live in any area, rural or urban. The Creole culture of Southwest Louisiana is thus more similar to the culture dominant in Acadiana than it is to the Creole culture of New Orleans.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-creoles-originate>Where did Creoles originate?</h2>
<p>Origins of the term Coined in the colonies that Spain and Portugal founded in the Americas, creole was originally used in the 16th century to refer to locally born individuals of Spanish, Portuguese, or African descent as distinguished from those born in Spain, Portugal, or Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-geography-of-creoles>What is the geography of Creoles?</h2>
<p>In Africa, the term Creole refers to any people with some mix of African and non-African racial or cultural heritage. Creole populations can be found on most African islands and along many of the continent’s coasts, areas where Africans first mingled with Europeans and Arabs.</p>
<h2 id=are-creoles-latino>Are creoles Latino?</h2>
<p>Creole. The term Creole means that you have parents who immigrated from a European country but you were born in the U.S. or that you have at least one parent or ancestral line that is Creole. In Louisiana, it can mean that you are of Spanish descent, which means that you would be considered Hispanic, but not Latino.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-creoles-develop>How do creoles develop?</h2>
<p>A creole is believed to arise when a pidgin, developed by adults for use as a second language, becomes the native and primary language of their children – a process known as nativization. Because of that prejudice, many of the creoles that arose in the European colonies, having been stigmatized, have become extinct.</p>
<h2 id=what-color-is-a-creole-person>What color is a Creole person?</h2>
<p>Some Creoles self-identify as Black, others white, and some Native American, but all recognize the term, Creole. Through America’s racial caste system, they experienced many of the legal rights and privileges of whites.</p>
<h2 id=did-cajuns-own-slaves>Did Cajuns own slaves?</h2>
<p>Members of this group might own a few slaves but certainly not as many as planters. Finally, a very large number of Acadians continued to labor as subsistence farmers, working their land without the assistance of slaves.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-people-are-the-creoles-of-louisiana>What kind of people are the Creoles of Louisiana?</h2>
<p>Louisiana historian Fred B. Kniffin, in Louisiana: Its Land and People, has asserted that the term Creole “has been loosely extended to include people of mixed blood, a dialect of French, a breed of ponies, a distinctive way of cooking, a type of house, and many other things. It is therefore no precise term and should not be defined as such.”</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-atlantic-ocean-creole-language-come-from>Where does the Atlantic Ocean Creole language come from?</h2>
<p>Atlantic Creole languages are based on European languages with elements from African and possibly Amerindian languages. Indian Ocean Creole languages are based on European languages with elements from Malagasy and possibly other Asian languages. There are, however, creoles like Nubi and Sango that are derived solely from non-European languages.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-creole-people-in-reunion-and-seychelles>Who are Creole people in Reunion and Seychelles?</h2>
<p>In Mauritius, the term Creole refers to colored people who have the ancestry of Africans with some French and Indian blood. The term also indicates the same to the people of Réunion and Seychelles. In all three societies, creole also refers to the new languages derived from French and incorporating other languages.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-creoles-settle-in-west-africa>Where did the Creoles settle in West Africa?</h2>
<p>The Creoles settled across West Africa in the nineteenth century in communities such as Limbe, Cameroon, Conakry, Guinea, Banjul, Gambia, Lagos, Nigeria, Abeokuta, Calabar, Accra, Ghana, Cape Coast, Fernando Pó.</p>
