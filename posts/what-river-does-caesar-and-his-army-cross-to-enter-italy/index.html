<h2 id=what-river-does-caesar-and-his-army-cross-to-enter-italy>What river does Caesar and his army cross to enter Italy?</h2>
<p>This week (Jan. 10 by the Roman calendar) in 49 B.C., Roman proconsul Julius Caesar and his army crossed the Rubicon River, which marked the boundary between the Roman province of Gaul and Italy proper.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-julius-caesar-cross-the-rubicon-river>Where did Julius Caesar cross the Rubicon River?</h2>
<p>Italy<br>
The Rubicon (Latin: Rubico, Italian: Rubicone pronounced [rubiˈkone]) is a shallow river in northeastern Italy, just north of Rimini. It was known as Fiumicino until 1933, when it was identified with the ancient river Rubicon, famously crossed by Julius Caesar in 49 BC….</p>

<p>pass the point of no return<br>
The expression means to make a difficult decision with irreversible consequences – in short, to pass the point of no return. It refers back to a decision made by Julius Caesar in January 49 BC that changed Ancient Rome forever.</p>
<h2 id=what-river-did-julius-caesar-cross-with-his-army-in-defiance-of-the-roman-senate>What river did Julius Caesar cross with his army in defiance of the Roman Senate?</h2>
<p>But when Caesar crossed the Rubicon River in northern Italy, he brought his army with him in defiance of the senate’s order. This fateful decision led to a civil war.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-crossing-the-rubicon-mean-quizlet>What does crossing the Rubicon mean quizlet?</h2>
<p>What was the significance of Caesar crossing the Rubicon River? it was a declaration of war on Rome. The Rubicon was a boundary of Roman territory and Caesar was required to give up his command once he crossed it. By not doing so, he was declaring civil war on Rome.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-julius-caesar-say-veni-vidi-vici>Why did Julius Caesar say Veni Vidi Vici?</h2>
<p>​a Latin phrase meaning ‘I came, I saw, I conquered’. It was first said by Julius Caesar after winning a battle in Asia Minor (now Turkey). Many people, especially in Britain, wrongly think he said it after defeating the Britons.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-caesar-crossing-the-rubicon-illegal>Why was Caesar crossing the Rubicon illegal?</h2>
<p>From it sprang the Roman Empire and the genesis of modern European culture. An ancient Roman law forbade any general from crossing the Rubicon River and entering Italy proper with a standing army. To do so was treason. This tiny stream would reveal Caesar’s intentions and mark the point of no return.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-julius-caesar-start-a-civil-war>Why did Julius Caesar start a civil war?</h2>
<p>Caesar’s Civil War resulted from the long political subversion of the Roman Government’s institutions, which began with the career of Tiberius Gracchus, continuing with the Marian reforms of the legions, the bloody dictatorship of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, and completed by the First Triumvirate over Rome.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-caesar-cross-the-rubicon-in-rome>Where did Caesar cross the Rubicon in Rome?</h2>
<p>Historians clash over site of ancient Italian river which Caesar crossed triggering civil war in Rome. Three rivers in north-east Italy each claim to be the historical Rubicon. Historians will battle it out in mock trial this weekend to settle the question.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-italian-river-important-to-caesar>Why was the Italian river important to Caesar?</h2>
<p>Historians clash over site of ancient Italian river which Caesar crossed triggering civil war in Rome. However, the river itself lost its political importance in the reign of Emperor Augustus, who abolished its status as Italy’s northern frontier, and for centuries it faded into relative obscurity.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-romans-died-in-the-crossing-of-the-rhine>How many Romans died in the crossing of the Rhine?</h2>
<p>With 800 men, the Germans caused considerable mayhem, killing 74 Romans before driving them all the way back to Caesar’s main lines. While Caesar was preparing to launch a counter attack, he had an incredible stroke of luck.</p>
