<h2 id=how-is-the-indus-valley-civilization-mysterious>How is the Indus Valley Civilization mysterious?</h2>
<p>In addition to the lack of war, one of the lasting mysteries of the Indus civilization is the distinct lack of references to great leaders in the society. Finally, we haven’t found a bilingual translation tool, like the Rosetta Stone, for the Indus script.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-end-of-indus-valley-civilization-is-mysterious>Why the end of Indus Valley Civilization is mysterious?</h2>
<p>Many historians believe the Indus civilisation collapsed because of changes to the geography and climate of the area. Movements in the Earth’s crust (the outside layer) might have caused the Indus river to flood and change its direction.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-mohenjo-daro-collapse>Why did Mohenjo-Daro collapse?</h2>
<p>Many scholars now believe the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization was caused by climate change. The eastward shift of monsoons may have reduced the water supply, forcing the Harappans of the Indus River Valley to migrate and establish smaller villages and isolated farms.</p>
<h2 id=who-destroyed-mohenjo-daro>Who destroyed Mohenjo-daro?</h2>
<p>Located on the bank of Indus River in the southern province of Sindh, Mohenjodaro was built around 2400 BC. It was destroyed at least seven times by the floods and rebuilt on the top of ruins each time.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-indus-valley-civilisation-get-its-name>How did the Indus Valley Civilisation get its name?</h2>
<p>The Indus Valley Civilisation was named after the Indus Valley, where the first remains were found. The Indus Valley Civilisation was also named as the Harappan civilisation after Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s, in what was then the Punjab province of British India.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-sites-were-found-along-the-indus-river>How many sites were found along the Indus River?</h2>
<p>However, contrary to its name only about 100 sites are found along the Indus and its tributaries. While over 500 sites are discovered along Gaggar-Hakra River (which is believed to be the long-lost river, Saraswati). Now, many archaeologists prefer to call them as ‘Indus-Saraswati Civilization,’…</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-harappan-civilisation-affect-the-indus-valley-civilisation>How did the Harappan civilisation affect the Indus Valley Civilisation?</h2>
<p>Previously, scholars believed that the decline of the Harappan civilisation led to an interruption of urban life in the Indian subcontinent. However, the Indus Valley Civilisation did not disappear suddenly, and many elements of the Indus Civilisation appear in later cultures.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-indus-cities-start-to-fail>Why did the Indus cities start to fail?</h2>
<p>Around the time the Indus cities started to fail, Mesopotamia was going through huge political problems. Their trade networks collapsed and this would have had a big impact on the Indus cities. There would have been less work for traders and for manufacturers, who made the things which the traders sold abroad.</p>
