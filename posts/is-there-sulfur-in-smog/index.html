<h2 id=is-there-sulfur-in-smog>Is there sulfur in smog?</h2>
<p>Sulfurous smog, also known as London smog, develops due to high concentration of sulfur oxides in the air. This gas is a serious air pollutant, causing irritation to human eyes, nose and lungs. It is released into the air by sulfur-bearing fossil fuels like coal. Volcanoes also emit sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=does-photochemical-smog-contain-sulfuric-acid>Does photochemical smog contain sulfuric acid?</h2>
<p>Toxic levels of ozone created by photochemical smog can damage lung tissue and lower the immune system. The sulfuric acid created by industrial smog has caused thousands of fatalities beginning with the Industrial Revolution and continuing until today.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-composition-of-classical-smog>What is the composition of classical smog?</h2>
<p>1. classical smog – This is the typical form of smog found in areas which have a humid climate. It is a mixture of smoke, fog and sulphur dioxide. This smog acts as a reducing agent in atmospheric pollution and hence it is also known as reducing smog.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-major-source-of-photochemical-smog>What is the major source of photochemical smog?</h2>
<p>Photochemical smog is produced when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC) in the atmosphere. Nitrogen oxides come from car exhaust, coal power plants, and factory emissions. VOCs are released from gasoline, paints, and many cleaning solvents.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-sulfuric-acid-related-to-industrial-smog>How is sulfuric acid related to industrial smog?</h2>
<p>The sulfuric acid created by industrial smog has caused thousands of fatalities beginning with the Industrial Revolution and continuing until today. Smog, in both its forms, can also cause breathing problems and skin irritations, and can even corrode buildings. United States Environmental Protection Agency: Smog…</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-acid-rains-and-photochemical-smog>What is the difference between acid rains and photochemical smog?</h2>
<p>There are common constituents in acid rains and photochemical smog. Nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide gases are the reasons for acidic rains. Also nitrogen dioxide initiate the photochemical smog. Difference is, for acid rains, hydrocarbons are not required.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-common-chemical-found-in-smog>Which is the most common chemical found in smog?</h2>
<p>Environmental legislation has placed more stringent limits on sulfur pollutants, which has improved air quality and reduced industrial smog. Ozone, the most common chemical in urban smog, is the result of a complex photochemical reaction between nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-the-formation-of-photochemical-smog-in-a-city>What causes the formation of photochemical smog in a city?</h2>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide and hydrocarbons are the primary precursors of photochemical smog. If a city is rounded from mountains, exhaust gases are unable to leave the surrounded area. We called this air “stagnated air”. Stagnated air helps to increase the photochemical smog.</p>
