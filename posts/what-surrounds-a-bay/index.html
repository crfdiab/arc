<h2 id=what-surrounds-a-bay>What surrounds a bay?</h2>
<p>A bay is a body of water partially surrounded by land. A bay is usually smaller and less enclosed than a gulf. The mouth of the bay, where meets the ocean or lake, is typically wider than that of a gulf.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-bay-formed>How are bay formed?</h2>
<p>When a stretch of coastline is formed from different types of rock, headlands and bays can form. Bands of soft rock such as clay and sand are weaker therefore they can be eroded quickly. This process forms bays. A bay is an inlet of the sea where the land curves inwards, usually with a beach.</p>
