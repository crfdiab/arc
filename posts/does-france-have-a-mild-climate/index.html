<h2 id=does-france-have-a-mild-climate>Does France have a mild climate?</h2>
<p>France has a mostly temperate climate, although there are many regional differences. France generally enjoys cool winters and mild summers except along the Mediterranean where mild winters and hot summers are the norm.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-weather-so-bad-in-france>Why is the weather so bad in France?</h2>
<p>Like many places on Earth, France has weather conditions that are strongly influenced by barometric pressure: low pressure tends to leave France open to the influence of the Atlantic airstream, bringing with it clouds and rain; but when a ridge of high pressure builds up over the heart of western Europe, a large part …</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-mildest-climate-in-france>Where is the mildest climate in France?</h2>
<p>The warmest place in France is the French Riviera coast in Southern France. With average summer temperatures well above 30oC (80oF) and long dry summers and warm springs and autumns and mild winters, the South of France is the place to experience the best climate in France throughout the year.</p>
<h2 id=does-france-have-a-temperate-climate>Does France have a temperate climate?</h2>
<p>France’s climate is temperate, but divided into four distinct climatic areas. The Mediterranean climate of south-eastern France is responsible for hot, dry summers, with rainfall from October to April (when the weather is damp but mild) and ample sunshine all year round (Provence, Côte d’Azur and Corsica).</p>
<h2 id=what-city-in-france-has-the-best-weather>What city in France has the best weather?</h2>
<p>Top 5 Sunniest Places in France</p>
<ol>
<li>Marseille. Located between the Mediterranean and the Alps, the climate in Marseille is characterised by long, hot summers, mild winters and lots of sunshine.</li>
<li>Corsica.</li>
<li>Nice.</li>
<li>Montpellier.</li>
<li>St Tropez.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=which-city-in-germany-has-the-best-weather>Which city in Germany has the best weather?</h2>
<p>The sunniest cities in Germany Chemnitz can rejoice at being officially named the sunniest city in Germany! Here, the sun shines for an average of 5,2 hours per day. Every day during June and July, the city basks in a glorious nine hours of sunshine – more than any other city!</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-climate-like-in-central-france>What is the climate like in central France?</h2>
<p>Central and eastern France’s continental climate harbours cold winters and hot summers (the Champagne region, Burgundy, Alsace). The Mediterranean climate of south-eastern France is responsible for hot, dry summers, with rainfall from October to April (when the weather is damp but mild) and ample sunshine all year round…</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-weather-like-in-france-in-the-spring>What’s the weather like in France in the spring?</h2>
<p>Spring rainfall is still plentiful, but summers are more likely to be warm and dry. Here sunny days are plentiful throughout the fall. Farther east, toward the Alsace region, the country enjoys a drier, sunnier climate, but winters can be very cold.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-weather-in-france-affected-by-the-wind>How is the weather in France affected by the wind?</h2>
<p>The climate of eastern and southern France is particularly influenced by the nature and direction of the wind La Bise is the dry east wind that can blow over from central Europe; in winter it can be bitterly cold, in summer blisteringly hot.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-climate-like-in-the-massif-central>What’s the climate like in the Massif Central?</h2>
<p>In the Massif Central the climate is harsh and cold. France’s Mediterranean coastline rejoices in hot summers and it’s usually very mild throughout winter too. The region does however get battered by the mistral wind. Cold in winter, warm in summer, this blustery wind blasts down the Rhône Valley toward the Riviera.</p>
