<h2 id=what-natural-resource-is-the-most-limited-in-the-middle-east>What natural resource is the most limited in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Oil is a limited, nonrenewable resource, meaning that when reserves run out, they are gone forever. The oil-rich nations of the Middle East will have struggling economies if their oil supply ever runs out.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-natural-resources-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa>What are the main natural resources in the Middle East and North Africa?</h2>
<p>What Is MENA?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region includes approximately 19 countries, according to World Atlas.</li>
<li>The region has vast oil, petroleum, and natural gas reserves.</li>
<li>Due to these reserves, MENA is an important source of global economic resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-resources-does-the-middle-east-have>What resources does the Middle East have?</h2>
<p>Like oil and water Today, abundant petroleum fields dominate the area’s economy. The Middle East is similarly disproportionately rich in natural gas (32 percent of the world’s known natural gas reserves are in the region) and phosphate (Morocco alone has more than half of the world’s reserves).</p>
<h2 id=where-does-most-of-the-middle-easts-oil-come-from>Where does most of the Middle East’s oil come from?</h2>
<p>When people think about the Middle East, they think about oil. According to 2020 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 27 percent of the world’s current oil production is sourced from this region.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-natural-resources-of-the-uae>What are the major natural resources of the UAE?</h2>
<p>Petroleum and natural gas reserves are the biggest natural resources of the UAE. Oil is an important and highly exploited natural resource for the UAE.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-natural-resources-did-mesopotamia-have>What kind of natural resources did Mesopotamia have?</h2>
<p>Apart from water and fertile soil (and later oil), Mesopotamia contains few natural resources, and has depended on trade with people in the mountainous regions to the north and east for stone, copper, and timber.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-middle-east-a-good-place-to-live>What makes the Middle East a good place to live?</h2>
<p>The skewed distribution of resources, coupled with limited access to economic opportunities and corruption impacts people’s preferences during times of instability, making the once socially-prohibited choices more acceptable and legitimated. One of the region’s strongest assets is its young population.</p>
