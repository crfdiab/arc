<h2 id=did-mandela-visit-australia>Did Mandela visit Australia?</h2>
<p>BORN a century ago today, Mandela was a hero to millions of people worldwide but he disappointed indigenous Australians when he visited in 1990. High on his list of countries to visit was Australia. This was partly because we had been among the strongest campaigners against apartheid.</p>
<h2 id=which-australian-has-played-for-nelson-mandela>Which Australian has played for Nelson Mandela?</h2>
<p>Perci Moeketsi feels an enormous responsibility as well as pride each night when he steps into the role of South Africa’s late president Nelson Mandela in Madiba the Musical. “That man inspired across all ages – every kid would want to be him,” said the actor, who still calls its capital Pretoria home.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-nelson-mandela-fighting-for>What is Nelson Mandela fighting for?</h2>
<p>Former South African president and civil rights advocate Nelson Mandela dedicated his life to fighting for equality—and ultimately helped topple South Africa’s racist system of apartheid. His accomplishments are now celebrated each year on July 18, Nelson Mandela International Day.</p>
<h2 id=is-nelson-mandela-from-cape-town>Is Nelson Mandela from Cape Town?</h2>
<p>Cape Town is home to South Africa’s parliament, and it is from here that Mandela ran the country as president. Between 1994 and 1999, he served as South Africa’s first democratically elected ruler from this building, and it’s open to the public for free tours.</p>
<h2 id=what-difference-came-in-mandela-opinion>What difference came in Mandela opinion?</h2>
<p>Answer: there were many difference in Mandela’s opinion about the meaning of freedom, when he was little boy and when he became young . while he was little boy , the meaning of freedom was to run in the field and to swim in the streams . when he became young , he realised that his freedom was an illusion.</p>
<h2 id=was-mandela-born-with-a-free-hunger>Was Mandela born with a free hunger?</h2>
<p>Nelson Mandela was not born with a hunger to be free. In this hold, it felt that free until he obyed his father and tribe. The concept of the tribe was limited only to run in fields, swim in the local stream and ride on the slow moving bulls. When, he was a youth, he reliased that his boyhood freedom was an illusion.</p>
