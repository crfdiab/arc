<h2 id=how-many-people-flew-across-the-atlantic-before-lindberg>How many people flew across the Atlantic before Lindberg?</h2>
<p>81 people<br>
He was hailed as the “Columbus of the Air” in Latin America but received little notice in North America. From 1919 to 1927, an additional 78 people successfully flew across the Atlantic before Lindbergh’s attempt—a total of 81 people successfully flew across the Atlantic before Lindbergh.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-had-died-trying-to-fly-across-the-atlantic-ocean-prior-to-lindbergh-successfully-doing-it-in-1927>How many people had died trying to fly across the Atlantic Ocean prior to Lindbergh successfully doing it in 1927?</h2>
<p>four men<br>
By 1927, four men had died, three were seriously injured and two others went missing during their attempt, and the prize remained tantalizingly out of reach. Lindbergh persuaded nine St. Louis businessmen to finance his attempt, using their funds to build a special plane that Lindbergh helped design.</p>
<h2 id=who-flew-across-the-atlantic-before-lindbergh>Who flew across the Atlantic before Lindbergh?</h2>
<p>John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown flew across the Atlantic with the help of a sextant, whisky and coffee in 1919—eight years before Charles Lindbergh’s flight. When it was all over, Captain John Alcock, an English pilot, telegraphed his story to newspaper reporters around the world.</p>
<h2 id=was-charles-lindbergh-the-first-to-cross-the-atlantic>Was Charles Lindbergh the first to cross the Atlantic?</h2>
<p>Charles Lindbergh wasn’t the first to fly across the Atlantic, but he was the first to make the non-stop transatlantic flight alone, propelling him into aviation history. Louis touched down at the Le Bourget airfield in Paris, after flying a total distance of 3,610 miles in 33.5 hours. A global celebrity was born.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-single-engine-plane-fly-over-water>Can a single engine plane fly over water?</h2>
<p>Many pilots avoid flying single engine aircraft over open water, but it’s not always possible. If you do find yourself planning a trip over a large body of water, here are some ways to stay prepared…</p>
<h2 id=when-did-charles-lindbergh-cross-the-atlantic-ocean>When did Charles Lindbergh cross the Atlantic Ocean?</h2>
<p>As Charles Lindbergh piloted the Spirit of St. Louis down the dirt runway of Roosevelt Field in New York on May 20, 1927, many doubted he would successfully cross the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-odds-of-lindbergh-flying-across-the-atlantic>What was the odds of Lindbergh flying across the Atlantic?</h2>
<p>Before Lindbergh left, Lloyd’s of London was quoting odds of 10 to 1 against any team winning the prize that year, and felt the odds against Lindbergh himself doing it were too high to be worth quoting at all until he was spotted off the Irish coast. The fame Lindbergh earned from his flight surprised him more than anyone.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-cross-the-atlantic-ocean>Who was the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean?</h2>
<p>In 1870, the small City of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) became the first small lifeboat to cross the Atlantic from Cork to Boston with two crew, John Charles Buckley and Nikola Primorac (di Costa). In 1896, Frank Samuelsen and George Harbo from Norway became the first people to ever row across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-lindbergh-to-get-to-ireland>How long did it take Lindbergh to get to Ireland?</h2>
<p>Alcock and Brown’s WWI Vickers-Vimy bomber made the prize-winning flight from Newfoundland to Ireland (just under 2,000 miles) in a little more than 16 hours. Pshaw! you say — Newfoundland hardly counts because it sticks out into the Atlantic; Lindbergh flew all the way from New York.</p>
