<p>According to Rashi, there were 48 prophets and 7 prophetesses of Judaism. The last Jewish prophet is believed to have been Malachi. In Jewish tradition it is believed that the period of prophecy, called Nevuah, ended with Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi at which time the “Shechinah departed from Israel”.</p>

Samuel was the son of Elkanah and Hannah, and he was born at Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim.</p>
<h2 id=was-king-david-a-prophet-in-judaism>Was King David a prophet in Judaism?</h2>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-milk-did-they-drink-in-the-bible>What kind of milk did they drink in the Bible?</h2>
<p>The Israelites drank goat and sheep’s milk when it was available in the spring and summer, and ate butter and cheese.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-prophets-of-israel-in-the-bible>Who are the Prophets of Israel in the Bible?</h2>
<p>Many nations shall come and say, “Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; he will teach us His ways, and we shall walk in His paths.” For out of Zion the law shall go forth, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. Watched Judah revert back to their evil ways under Manasseh, and Amon.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-prophets-sent-to-all-nations>Are there any prophets sent to all nations?</h2>
<p>Rather they were sent to all nations, in different places and at different times, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily! We have sent you with the truth, a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner. And there never was a nation but a warner had passed among them.”</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-prophets-say-to-the-people>What did the Prophets say to the people?</h2>
<p>The prophets spoke for God to the people, receiving God’s message through visions, dreams, and ecstasies. The prophetic message varied with the circumstances. When things were going well, the prophets warned the people about impending doom if they did not change their ways.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-prophets-say-about-the-coming-judgment>What did the Prophets say about the coming judgment?</h2>
<p>God sent prophet after prophet to warn Israel of the coming judgment. Ancient Israel rejected the prophets’ warnings and based on the second covenant, the nation was destroyed. God kept His word. Actually the nation was destroyed twice.</p>
