<h2 id=what-kind-of-language-is-gullah>What kind of language is Gullah?</h2>
<p>creole language<br>
The Gullah language, typically referred to as “Geechee” in Georgia, is technically known as an English-based creole language, created when peoples from diverse backgrounds find themselves thrown together and must communicate.</p>
<h2 id=is-gullah-a-creolized-language>Is Gullah a Creolized language?</h2>
<p>Gullah (gul. lah) n. – one of a group of people of African ancestry that live in the Sea Islands and coastal areas of South Carolina, Georgia, and northern Florida; the creolized language of the Gullahs, based on English and several other African languages and spoken in Sea Island communities.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-slaves-in-louisiana-come-from>Where did slaves in Louisiana come from?</h2>
<p>The Africans enslaved in Louisiana came mostly from Senegambia, the Bight of Benin, the Bight of Biafra, and West-Central Africa. A few of them came from Southeast Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-slaves-speak-when-they-first-came-to-america>What did slaves speak when they first came to America?</h2>
<p>What languages did slaves speak when they were first brought to the U.S. from Africa and what happened to those languages over time? The languages that slaves spoke were varied; there was no single language that they all spoke.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-slaves-of-the-southern-states-not-speak-english>Why did the slaves of the southern states not speak English?</h2>
<p>They only spoke African “tribal languages” the majority of the slaves were sent to southern states. The white “slave masters” themselves did not speak proper American English. And matter of fact, the majority of white people living in the southern states did not speak proper American Standard English either.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-language-used-in-the-atlantic-slave-trade>What was the language used in the Atlantic slave trade?</h2>
<p>Writings about the origins of AAVE offer more insight into the history of languages used by Africans enslaved during the Atlantic slave trade. That doesn’t follow: most languages in the world have no written form, but they get transmitted just fine.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-african-languages-spoken-in-the-usa>Are there any African languages spoken in the USA?</h2>
<p>It’s unlikely any purely African languages were spoken by slaves in the USA. Pidgins developed on the ships, which evolved into creoles, which were heavily influenced by English and French, is one theory.</p>
