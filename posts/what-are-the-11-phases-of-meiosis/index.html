<h2 id=what-are-the-10-phases-of-meiosis>What are the 10 phases of meiosis?</h2>
<p>In this video Paul Andersen explains the major phases of meiosis including: interphase, prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, telophase I, cytokinesis, interphase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II. He explains how variation is created in the next generation through meiosis and sexual reproduction.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-mitosis-and-meiosis>What is the difference between mitosis and meiosis?</h2>
<p>Cells divide and reproduce in two ways, mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis results in two identical daughter cells, whereas meiosis results in four sex cells. Below we highlight the keys differences and similarities between the two types of cell division.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-5-stages-of-meiosis>What are the 5 stages of meiosis?</h2>
<p>Therefore, meiosis includes the stages of meiosis I (prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, telophase I) and meiosis II (prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, telophase II).</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-of-meiosis-1-and-2>What’s the difference of meiosis 1 and 2?</h2>
<p>Meiosis is the production of four genetically diverse haploid daughter cells from one diploid parent cell. In meiosis II, these chromosomes are further separated into sister chromatids. Meiosis I includes crossing over or recombination of genetic material between chromosome pairs, while meiosis II does not.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-meiosis-1-and-2>What is the difference between meiosis 1 and 2?</h2>
<h2 id=what-are-the-steps-of-mitosis>What are the steps of mitosis?</h2>
<p>Today, mitosis is understood to involve five phases, based on the physical state of the chromosomes and spindle. These phases are prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-similarities-and-3-differences-between-mitosis-and-meiosis>What are 3 similarities and 3 differences between mitosis and meiosis?</h2>
<p>Mitosis consists of one stage whereas meiosis consists of two stages. Mitosis produces diploid cells (46 chromosomes) whereas meiosis produces haploid cells (23 chromosomes). Mitosis produces two identical daughter cells whereas meiosis produces four genetically different daughter cells.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-stages-of-meiosis-related-to-each-other>How are the stages of meiosis related to each other?</h2>
<p>Meiosis 1 separates the pair of homologous chromosomes and reduces the diploid cell to haploid. It is divided into several stages that include, prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. The different stages of meiosis 1 can be explained by the following phases : The chromosomes begin to condense and attain a compact structure during leptotene.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-stages-of-mitotic-cell-division>What are the stages of mitotic cell division?</h2>
<p>Mitotic cell division is equational in nature while meiosis is a reduction division. Meiosis 1 separates the pair of homologous chromosomes and reduces the diploid cell to haploid. It is divided into several stages that include, prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-meiosis-1-also-known-as-reductional-division>Why is meiosis 1 also known as reductional division?</h2>
<p>Why is meiosis 1 also known as reductional division? Meiosis 1 is known as reductional division because in this process the number of chromosomes is reduced to half, i.e., from diploid to haploid. What do you understand by crossing over in meiosis 1?</p>
<h2 id=how-many-haploid-daughter-cells-are-produced-in-meiosis>How many haploid daughter cells are produced in meiosis?</h2>
<p>The cytoplasm and cell divides producing 4 non-identical haploid daughter cells. To know more about what is meiosis, and the process of meiosis cell division along with the different stages, keep visiting BYJU’S website or download BYJU’S app for further reference.</p>
