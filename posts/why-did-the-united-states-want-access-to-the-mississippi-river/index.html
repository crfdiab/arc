<h2 id=why-did-the-united-states-want-access-to-the-mississippi-river>Why did the United States want access to the Mississippi River?</h2>
<p>Why did the United States want access to the Mississippi River? Travel and trade were difficult on the frontier and the access to the Mississippi River would offer an easier means of transportation for frontier farmers and merchants.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-jeffersons-main-goal-regarding-native-americans-in-the-louisiana-territory>What was Jefferson’s main goal regarding Native Americans in the Louisiana Territory?</h2>
<p>Through treaties and commerce, Jefferson hoped to continue to get Native Americans to adopt European agricultural practices, shift to a sedentary way of life, and free up hunting grounds for further white settlement.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-washingtons-close-advisers-were-known-as-his>What was Washington’s close advisers were known as his?</h2>
<p>Departments of State, War, and Treasury were established, along with the office of Attorney General, each headed by a trusted presidential adviser. These advisers collectively became known as the cabinet. Washington strove for ideological balance in these appointments, thus augmenting their strength and credibility.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-government-acquire-native-american-lands>How did the US government acquire Native American lands?</h2>
<p>The new United States government was thus free to acquire Native American lands by treaty or force. Resistance from the tribes stopped the encroachment of settlers, at least for a while.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-native-american-war>What was the outcome of the Native American War?</h2>
<p>Although neither the United States nor Great Britain could claim victory in the war, Native Americans were left without an ally in the fight to save their lands. The conflict also led the United States to aspire to build a more unified nation, to seek an “American Identity.”</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-government-respond-to-native-american-resistance>How did the US government respond to Native American resistance?</h2>
<p>In response, the U.S. government enlisted the U.S. Army to ensure that resistance could be contained. The Army and state militias enforced the progress of construction through military occupation of Indigenous communities, deliberately targeting villages and food sources.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-native-american-tribes-respond-to-the-treaty>How did the Native American tribes respond to the Treaty?</h2>
<p>The Native American tribes responded peacefully to the treaty; in fact the Cheyenne , Sioux, Crow, Arapaho, Assinibione, Mandan, Gros Ventre and Arikara tribes who signed the treaty, even agreed to end the hostilities amongst their tribes in order to accept the terms of the treaty.</p>
