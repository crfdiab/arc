<h2 id=can-apple-be-grown-in-ghana>Can apple be grown in Ghana?</h2>
<p>Indeed, in Ghana, apples can grow in very cool areas like Abetifi, Amedzofe and Aburi. These areas experience temperate-like weather conditions that can accommodate the growth of apples and can allow apple trees to go through chilling stress before flowering.</p>
<h2 id=can-apple-tree-grow-in-africa>Can apple tree grow in Africa?</h2>
<p>Apples are considered an exotic fruit in many parts of Africa. They fetch a handsome price in markets across the continent as they are largely imported from overseas. Peter Wambugu is one of Kenya’s most successful apple farmers and harvests thousands of fruits on his farm every year.</p>

<h2 id=what-climate-is-best-for-growing-apples>What climate is best for growing apples?</h2>
<p>Even though apple trees can grow in almost any hardiness zone, apples grow best in climates where it’s cold in winter, moderate in the summer and has medium to high humidity. They can tolerate winter temperatures as low as negative 40°F.</p>
<h2 id=can-strawberry-grow-in-ghana>Can Strawberry grow in Ghana?</h2>

<h2 id=can-apple-be-planted-in-nigeria>Can Apple be planted in Nigeria?</h2>
<p>They can not be grown in Nigeria because they require cold conditions for optimal growth and fruit production. However, the apples have been grown in the past in the plateau regions of Nigeria like the Jos, Mambila and Obudu plateau.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-plant-an-apple-tree-from-an-apple-seed>Can you plant an apple tree from an apple seed?</h2>

<h2 id=do-apple-trees-fruit-every-year>Do apple trees fruit every year?</h2>
<p>Biennial bearing is a problem in some fruit trees, particularly apples and pears, where they crop heavily in one year and then produce little or nothing the next. Some cultivars are naturally biennial but weather conditions and soil fertility can contribute to the problem.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-grow-apples-in-africa>Is it possible to grow apples in Africa?</h2>
<p>Apples cannot grow in Africa, this belief, as well as many others about Africa, are falsehoods.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-apple-trees-in-the-tropics>Are there any apple trees in the tropics?</h2>
