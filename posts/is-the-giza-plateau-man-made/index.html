<h2 id=whats-under-the-giza-plateau>What’s under the Giza plateau?</h2>
<p>An enormous system of caves, chambers and tunnels lies hidden beneath the Pyramids of Giza, according to a British explorer who claims to have found the lost underworld of the pharaohs. Populated by bats and venomous spiders, the underground complex was found in the limestone bedrock beneath the pyramid field at Giza.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-inside-the-pyramid-of-giza>What is inside the pyramid of Giza?</h2>
<p>What’s inside the pyramids of Giza? The pyramids of Giza are mostly solid masses of stone with very little to be found inside. Like many ancient Egyptian pyramids, those of Khafre and Menkaure have passageways at their base that lead to small subterranean burial chambers underneath each pyramid.</p>

<h2 id=how-old-is-the-giza-plateau-in-egypt>How old is the Giza Plateau in Egypt?</h2>
<p>How old is Giza? R ecent Carbon-14 dating results indicate a period of construction from between 3,800 and 2,800 BC (2), a time-frame which is considerably earlier than is currently claimed by Egyptologists (Official estimates still vary from year to year around the region of 2,650 to 2,450 BC).</p>

<h2 id=how-are-plateaus-formed-in-africa-and-ethiopia>How are plateaus formed in Africa and Ethiopia?</h2>
<p>The upwelling in the ground expels the visible layer of the Earth up, creating a plateau. Plateaus that contain underlying volcanic rock, as many do in East Africa and Ethiopia, were formed through this process. Where the ground was level to begin with, the plateaus were uplifted evenly.</p>
