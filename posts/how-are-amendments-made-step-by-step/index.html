<h2 id=how-are-amendments-made-step-by-step>How are amendments made step by step?</h2>
<p>o Step 1: Two-thirds of both houses of Congress pass a proposed constitutional amendment. This sends the proposed amendment to the states for ratification. o Step 2: Three-fourths of the states (38 states) ratify the proposed amendment, either by their legislatures or special ratifying conventions.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-amendments-created-and-approved>How are amendments created and approved?</h2>
<p>Congress may submit a proposed constitutional amendment to the states, if the proposed amendment language is approved by a two-thirds vote of both houses. Congress must call a convention for proposing amendments upon application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the states (i.e., 34 of 50 states).</p>
<h2 id=who-proposes-an-amendment>Who proposes an amendment?</h2>
<p>the Congress<br>
Amendments may be proposed either by the Congress, through a joint resolution passed by a two-thirds vote, or by a convention called by Congress in response to applications from two-thirds of the state legislatures.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-amendments-added-to-the-us-constitution>How are amendments added to the US Constitution?</h2>
<p>How Amendments Are Made It takes two steps to add an amendment to the Constitution: Step 1: Proposal – An amendment can be proposed by either a two-thirds vote in Congress, including both the House of Representatives and the Senate, or a national convention made up of two-thirds of the states.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-ratification-of-an-amendment-made>How is the ratification of an amendment made?</h2>
<p>For an amendment to be made, two-thirds of the members of each house of Congress must approve it, and three-fourths of the states must ratify it. Congress decides whether the ratification will be by state legislatures or by popularly elected conventions in the several states (though in only one instance, that of the Twenty-First Amendment,…</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-start-the-amendment-process>What’s the best way to start the amendment process?</h2>
<p>Another option to start the amendment process is that two-thirds of the state legislatures could ask Congress to call a Constitutional Convention. A new Constitutional Convention has never happened, but the idea has its backers.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-process-for-the-era-amendment>What was the process for the ERA Amendment?</h2>
<p>The amendment process is very difficult and time consuming: A proposed amendment must be passed by two-thirds of both houses of Congress, then ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states. The ERA Amendment did not pass the necessary majority of state legislatures in the 1980s.</p>
