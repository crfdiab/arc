<p>Sound Signaling Devices: Vessels 39.4′ (12 meters) or more in length are required to carry a whistle and a bell.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-on-a-compliance-notice>What is on a compliance notice?</h2>
<p>The compliance notice states that the vessel complies with the construction requirements when it was built or imported (whichever date was most recent). The notice also shows the maximum number of people that can safely board the vessel. This is also known as a “capacity label.”</p>
<h2 id=why-is-carrying-a-sound-signalling-device-on-board-important>Why is carrying a sound Signalling device on board important?</h2>
<p>A sound-signalling device or appliance is essential in periods of reduced visibility, such as fog and heavy rain, or whenever a boat operator needs to signal his or her intentions or position. For example, sound signals are necessary when meeting head-on, crossing, or overtaking, and in emergency situations.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-of-a-vessel-do-you-have-to-have-to-make-a-sound>How big of a vessel do you have to have to make a sound?</h2>
<p>Every vessel less than 12 meters (39.4 ft.) in length must carry an efficient sound-producing device. The sound-producing device need not meet any particular specifications, as long as the vessel can produce signals required by the navigational rules.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-boating-regulations-in-new-york>What are the boating regulations in New York?</h2>
<p>New York Boating Safety Requirements Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs aka Life Jackets) Every pleasure vessel including canoes, kayaks and rowboats operated upon the waters of NYS must have on board one United States Coast Guard approved wearable Personal Flotation Device (PFD) for each person on the vessel.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-does-a-vessel-have-to-be-to-use-a-mouth-whistle>How big does a vessel have to be to use a mouth whistle?</h2>
<p>On vessels less than 39 feet in length, which includes PWC, a mouth whistle may be used if it can make a sound signal that is audible for at least one-half mile and lasts two seconds or more. Vessels more than 39 feet in length must carry a bell also. These requirements apply to vessels operating on federally controlled waters.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-vessels-under-16-feet>What do you need to know about vessels under 16 feet?</h2>
<p>Vessels under 16 feet 1 Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs) One approved Type I, II or III for each person on board or being towed on water skis etc. Must be USCG-approved. 2 Fire Extinguisher. 3 Visual Distress Signal. 4 Sound-producing Device. 5 Backfire Flame Control. 6 Ventilation. 7 Vessel Lighting. …</p>
