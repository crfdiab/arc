<h2 id=did-florida-secede-from-the-union-if-so-what-number-state-were-we-to-leave>Did Florida secede from the Union if so what number state were we to leave?</h2>
<p>On January 10, 1861, Florida delegates who were meeting in the state capital, Tallahassee, voted to secede from the U.S. Florida became one of the six original Southern states to form the Confederate States of America; eventually, 11 states would leave the Union.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-secession-of-the-south-from-the-union>What caused the secession of the South from the Union?</h2>
<p>Many maintain that the primary cause of the war was the Southern states’ desire to preserve the institution of slavery. Others minimize slavery and point to other factors, such as taxation or the principle of States’ Rights. Two major themes emerge in these documents: slavery and states’ rights.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-status-of-florida-during-the-civil-war>What was the status of Florida during the Civil War?</h2>
<p>Florida did not sit out of the Civil War. In fact, it was the third state to leave, after South Carolina and Mississippi. It now is the most “northern” of the southern states.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-one-contributing-factor-for-the-election-of-african-american-in-florida-after-reconstruction>What is one contributing factor for the election of African American in Florida after reconstruction?</h2>
<p>What is one contributing factor for the election of African Americans in Florida after Reconstruction? Anti-Reconstruction groups were no longer in the state. The population of Florida was growing quickly after the war. Formerly enslaved persons were able to vote for the first time.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-florida-secede-from-the-union-along-with-south-carolina>When did Florida secede from the Union along with South Carolina?</h2>
<p>Along with South Carolina, it seceded first. Along with six other Southern states, its seceded shortly after South Carolina. Along with Texas, California, and Oregon, it seceded after the start of the war. Along with Louisiana, it seceded about a year after the start of the war. Ask for details. Follow.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-third-state-to-secede-from-the-union>Which is the third state to secede from the Union?</h2>
<p>Only an undated, untitled draft remains. The delegates adopted a new state constitution and within a month the state joined other southern states to form the Confederate States of America. Florida was the third state to secede.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-florida-join-the-confederate-states-of-america>When did Florida join the Confederate States of America?</h2>
<p>Florida joined the Confederate States of America at the beginning of the Civil War, as the third of the original seven states to secede from the Union, following Lincoln’s 1860 election.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-secretary-of-state-for-florida-during-the-civil-war>Who was the Secretary of State for Florida during the Civil War?</h2>
<p>William S. Harris was the convention’s secretary. On January 7, the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of immediate secession, delegates voting sixty-two to seven to withdraw Florida from the Union.</p>
