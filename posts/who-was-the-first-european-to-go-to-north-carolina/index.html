<h2 id=who-was-the-first-european-to-go-to-north-carolina>Who was the first European to go to North Carolina?</h2>

Sir Walter Raleigh sends several shiploads of people to establish the New World’s first English colony on North Carolina’s Roanoke Island.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-first-settlers-in-north-carolina>Who were the first settlers in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>The first European settlement in what is today North Carolina—indeed, the first English settlement in the New World—was the “lost colony of Roanoke,” founded by the English explorer and poet Walter Raleigh in 1587. On July 22nd of that year, John White and 121 settlers came to Roanoke Island in present-day Dare County.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-north-carolina>Who discovered North Carolina?</h2>
<p>North Carolina was first settled in 1587. 121 settlers led by John White landed on present-day Roanoke Island on July 22, 1587. It was the first English settlement in the New World. On August 18, 1587, White’s daughter gave birth to Virginia Dare, the first English child born in the New World.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-europeans-first-explore-what-is-now-north-carolina>Why did the Europeans first explore what is now North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Their initial motivation was primarily economic: after the “discovery” of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492, several navigators followed in his wake searching for the riches of the Orient.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-settlers-move-to-north-carolina>Why did settlers move to North Carolina?</h2>
<p>In the mid-1720s, the first permanent settlers arrived in the area around the lower Cape Fear River. Their arrival was due mainly to the efforts of South Carolina planter Maurice Moore and North Carolina governor George Burrington. Moore had come to North Carolina to help fight the Tuscarora Indians.</p>
<h2 id=were-there-slaves-in-north-carolina>Were there slaves in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Slavery has been part of North Carolina’s history since its settlement by Europeans in the late 1600s and early 1700s. Many of the first slaves in North Carolina were brought to the colony from the West Indies or other surrounding colonies, but a significant number were brought from Africa.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-scots-settle-in-north-carolina>Where did the Scots settle in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>The Lowland Scots who migrated from Scotland to North Carolina in the eighteenth century primarily settled in the Lower Cape Fear region, around Wilmington. The 1790 US census lists 150 inhabitants of the Upper Cape Fear Valley who named Scotland as their birthplace.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-explore-north-carolina>Who was the first person to explore North Carolina?</h2>

<h2 id=who-was-the-first-european-explorer-to-explore-north-america>Who was the first European explorer to explore North America?</h2>
<p>In 1524, the French king sponsored an expedition to the New World seeking the elusive Northwest Passage. The expedition was led by Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano (c. 1485–c. 1528), who explored the East Coast of the present-day United States from what is now North Carolina up to Nova Scotia, Canada.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-thomas-champlain-explore-in-north-america>Where did Thomas Champlain explore in North America?</h2>
<p>In his many journeys to New France, Champlain established the settlement of Quebec. He explored the Atlantic coast from present-day Nova Scotia down to Massachusetts , as well as Vermont , northern parts of New York, and the Great Lakes region.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-colony-in-north-carolina>Where was the first colony in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>On July 22nd of that year, John White and 121 settlers founded the Roanoke Colony on Roanoke Island in present-day Dare County, North Carolina.
