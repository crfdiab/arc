<h2 id=where-did-the-allied-air-operations-begin>Where did the allied air operations begin?</h2>
<p>Strategic bombing during World War II began on 1 September 1939 when Germany invaded Poland and the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) began bombing cities and the civilian population in Poland in an aerial bombardment campaign. As the war continued to expand, bombing by both the Axis and the Allies increased significantly.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-german-fighter-planes-called-in-ww2>What were the German fighter planes called in WW2?</h2>
<p>The German Luftwaffe fielded two of the best fighters in all of World War 2 – the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf 190.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-german-air-force-still-called-the-luftwaffe>Is the German Air Force still called the Luftwaffe?</h2>
<p>The German Air Force (as part of the Bundeswehr) was founded in 1956 during the era of the Cold War as the aerial warfare branch of the armed forces of then West Germany. The term Luftwaffe that is used for both the historic and the current German air force is the German-language generic designation of any air force.</p>
<h2 id=who-destroyed-the-luftwaffe>Who destroyed the Luftwaffe?</h2>
<p>After the defeat of Germany, the Luftwaffe was disbanded in 1946. During World War II, German pilots claimed roughly 70,000 aerial victories, while over 75,000 Luftwaffe aircraft were destroyed or significantly damaged. Of these, nearly 40,000 were lost entirely.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-common-german-bomber-in-ww2>What was the most common German bomber in WW2?</h2>
<p>Messerschmitt Bf 109 The most-produced aircraft of World War Two. The Messerschmitt Bf 109 formed the backbone of the Luftwaffe’s fighter force, with over 33,000 seeing service on all European fronts.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-allies-cross-the-rhine-into-germany>When did the Allies cross the Rhine into Germany?</h2>
<p>March 7, 1945<br>
Despite a partial news blackout, reporters are able to deliver some information about the U.S. Army’s successful crossing of the Rhine on March 7, 1945, though it is not yet known whether the Allies have captured the Ludendorff Bridge from the Germans.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-americans-cross-the-rhine>How did Americans cross the Rhine?</h2>
<p>Turning Point. The US Third Army carried out four river assaults in late March. The 5th Infantry Division undertook the first on March 22, 1945, crossing the Rhine at Oppenheim, south of Mainz. They crossed without the usual artillery preparation, a maneuver that caught German troops by surprise.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-adolf-hitlers-best-friend>Who was Adolf Hitler’s best friend?</h2>
<p>Friedrich Kubizek<br>
August (“Gustl”) Friedrich Kubizek (3 August 1888 – 23 October 1956) was an Austrian musical conductor best known for being a close friend of Adolf Hitler, when both were in their late teens.</p>
<h2 id=does-germany-still-use-the-iron-cross>Does Germany still use the iron cross?</h2>
<p>The Iron Cross still rates as Germany’s most famous military insignia, but its role has been reduced to that of a black and white emblem on the aircraft, tanks and warships of the post-war armed forces. It was dropped as a medal in 1945.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-location-of-the-movie-allied>Where was the location of the movie Allied?</h2>
<p>Alan Silvestri composed the music. Principal photography on the film began in February 2016 in London, with the family home located on the corners of Christchurch Hill and Willow Road in Hampstead. In May 2016 scenes set in Casablanca were shot in Gran Canaria, Canary Islands.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-raf-start-bombing-germany-in-1944>Why did the RAF start bombing Germany in 1944?</h2>
<p>As a result of the weakening of the German air defences and the availability of long-ranged Allied escort fighter aircraft, the RAF’s Bomber Command had been making occasional daylight raids on targets in Germany in addition to its usual night operations since late 1944. The frequency with which it conducted daylight attacks increased over time.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-obersalzberg-located-in-world-war-2>Where was Obersalzberg located in World War 2?</h2>
<p>Obersalzberg’s location was well known, and in June 1944 Allied intelligence confirmed that Hitler was directing the resistance to the Normandy landings from the Berghof. The Royal Air Force (RAF) developed a plan to attack Obersalzberg that was designated “Hellbound”.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-headquarters-of-the-german-3rd-army>Where was the headquarters of the German 3rd Army?</h2>
<p>Third Army, around the open German flank and into the German rear areas. U.S. XV Corps advanced no less than 75 mi (121 km) during the next three days, and by 7 August they were approaching Le Mans, formerly the location of the headquarters of the German 7th Army, and still an important logistic center.</p>
