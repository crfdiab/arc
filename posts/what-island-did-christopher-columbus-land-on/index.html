<h2 id=what-island-did-christopher-columbus-land-on>What island did Christopher Columbus land on?</h2>
<p>On October 12, 1492, Italian explorer Christopher Columbus made landfall in what is now the Bahamas. Columbus and his ships landed on an island that the native Lucayan people called Guanahani. Columbus renamed it San Salvador.</p>
<h2 id=which-caribbean-island-that-columbus-reached-on-his-first-voyage-is-farthest-west>Which Caribbean island that Columbus reached on his first voyage is farthest west?</h2>
<p>Guanahaní is an island in the Bahamas that was the first land in the New World sighted and visited by Christopher Columbus’ first voyage, on 12 October 1492. It is a bean-shaped island that Columbus changed from its native Taíno name to San Salvador.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-four-islands-in-the-caribbean-sea>What are the four islands in the Caribbean Sea?</h2>
<p>Greater Antilles, the four largest islands of the Antilles (q.v.)—Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico—lying north of the Lesser Antilles chain. They constitute nearly 90 percent of the total land area of the entire West Indies.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-caribbean-named>How was the Caribbean named?</h2>
<p>The name “Caribbean” derives from the Caribs, one of the region’s dominant Native American groups at the time of European contact during the late 15th century. During the first century of development, Spanish dominance in the region remained undisputed.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-deepest-point-in-the-caribbean-sea>What is the deepest point in the Caribbean Sea?</h2>
<p>7,686 m<br>
Caribbean Sea/Max depth</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-european-to-enter-the-caribbean-sea>Who was the first European to enter the Caribbean Sea?</h2>
<p>The first European to enter the Caribbean Sea was Christopher Columbus, who made landfall in the Bahamas in 1492 convinced that he had discovered a new route to Asia. He continued south to found a key Spanish colony on the island of Hispaniola (now divided politically between Haiti and the Dominican Republic).</p>
<h2 id=where-did-christopher-columbus-land-in-the-caribbean>Where did Christopher Columbus land in the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>Columbus and his ships landed on an island that the native Lucayan people called Guanahani. Columbus renamed it San Salvador.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-caribbean-sea-separated-from-the-ocean>Where is the Caribbean Sea separated from the ocean?</h2>
<p>The Caribbean Sea is separated from the ocean by several island arcs of various ages. The youngest stretches from the Lesser Antilles to the Virgin Islands to the north east of Trinidad and Tobago off the coast of Venezuela.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-other-islands-in-the-caribbean-sea>Are there any other islands in the Caribbean Sea?</h2>
<p>The towns along these coasts share the same turquoise-blue waters and powder-white beaches as the likes of the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, and every other island sitting in the Caribbean Sea. The advantage though is you don’t have to pay a fortune to live here.</p>
