<h2 id=how-did-colonization-affect-asia>How did colonization affect Asia?</h2>
<p>Colonialism has altered Southeast Asian social structure and brought modern western ideas and concepts into society as well. Some of these ideas contained the western culture, western style education, human rights, religion, etc. The arrival of European powers has made the growth of population in the region.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-europeans-want-to-trade-with-asia>Did the Europeans want to trade with Asia?</h2>
<p>When the Ottoman Turks took over Constantinople, trade was disrupted. This led European traders to seek a new way to trade with the Asian countries. Other routes, including those by water, were explored. This desire for new trade routes led Christopher Columbus to seek a route to Asia across the Atlantic Ocean in 1492.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-european-exploration-affect-asia>How did European exploration affect Asia?</h2>
<p>The prices of Asian goods like spices and fabrics dropped, and more people in Europe could afford to buy them. Not only did Portuguese sailors bring back spices and goods from the Indian Ocean (cinnamon, pepper, porcelain, jewels and silk) but they also brought slavery to their colony of Brazil.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-greatest-consequence-of-european-exploration>What was the greatest consequence of European Exploration?</h2>
<p>European explorations led to the Columbian Exchange and an increase in international trade. European nations competed for colonies. The European economy underwent major changes. Today, as in the days of mercantilism, some groups want to restrict global trade to protect certain jobs and industries from competition.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-european-to-invade-india>Who was the first European to invade India?</h2>
<p>explorer Vasco de Gama<br>
Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama becomes the first European to reach India via the Atlantic Ocean when he arrives at Calicut on the Malabar Coast.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-trade-between-europe-and-asia-so-important>Why was trade between Europe and Asia so important?</h2>
<p>These influenced local lifestyles and inspired Asian scholars, artists and craftsmen. The East occupied an important place in the western imagination. The reverse was also true. European objects and artefacts, sometimes reworked to suit Asian lifestyles, created a corresponding vision of a mysterious and exotic West.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-europeans-set-up-missions-in-africa>Why did the Europeans set up missions in Africa?</h2>
<p>Chaplains were assigned to forts, but their role was to serve the Europeans, not to evangelize Africans. By the 1800s believers from Europe and America, enraged by the slave trade, began establishing Christian missions in Africa.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-japan-and-china-want-to-close-themselves-off-from-europe>Why did Japan and China want to close themselves off from Europe?</h2>
<p>For more information, you may want to read Samurai William by Giles Milton, which gives a very in-depth account of European trade in south-east Asia and Japan in the 16th and 17th century. For China, Europeans were allowed to conduct trade in enclaves, or walled-off portions of trade cities.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-trade-with-asia-in-the-1500s>What was trade with Asia in the 1500’s?</h2>
<p>During the period 1500-1800 Asian commodities flooded into the West. As well as spices and tea, they included silks, cottons, porcelains and other luxury goods.</p>
