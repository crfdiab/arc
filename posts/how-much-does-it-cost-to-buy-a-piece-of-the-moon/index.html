<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-piece-of-the-moon>How much does it cost to buy a piece of the moon?</h2>
<p>You Can Now Buy a Piece of the Moon for $2.5 Million.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-buy-land-on-the-moon-legally>Can you buy land on the Moon legally?</h2>
<p>It is true! You too can become a Lunar Land Owner by purchasing acres of land on the Moon. Lunar Land is one of THE FIRST companies in the world to file for a legal TRADEMARK and COPYRIGHT for the sale of extraterrestrial property within the confines of our solar system.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-buy-acreage-on-the-moon>Can you buy acreage on the Moon?</h2>
<p>It is true! You too can become a Lunar Land Owner by purchasing acres of land on the Moon. LUNAR LAND company is the world’s most recognized Celestial Real Estate Agency and has been selling land on the Moon for decades.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-pay-to-go-to-space>Can you pay to go to space?</h2>
<p>So far, only a handful of people have been able to pay their way into space. (Even NSYNC singer Lance Bass wasn’t able to raise the $20 million he needed to fly with a Russian space crew in 2002.) Now, the richest people in the world seem dead set on making regular private space flights a reality.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-touch-the-moon-with-a-bare-hand>Can you touch the moon with a bare hand?</h2>
<p>Based on measurements of the lunar soil and NASA guidelines on skin contact with hot objects, you would probably be able to press a bare hand against the hottest lunar soil without feeling uncomfortably warm. But if your hand hit a rock, you might find yourself yanking it back in pain.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-did-it-cost-to-land-on-the-moon>How much did it cost to land on the Moon?</h2>
<p>With a goal of a first landing on the Moon 10 years from now, at the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11, the development costs for the lunar base would average $3.5 billion per year, the equivalent of what is currently spent operating the Shuttle.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-the-surface-of-the-moon-worth>How much is the surface of the Moon Worth?</h2>
<p>By this method, the moon’s 9.3 billion acres are worth approximately $180 billion.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-did-it-cost-to-put-apollo-11-on-the-moon>How much did it cost to put Apollo 11 on the Moon?</h2>
<p>According to a recent analysis by the Planetary Society, that translates into an estimated $288.1 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars. That’s roughly equivalent to spending NASA’s current annual budget on a single project and sustaining that effort for more than a decade. “They’re back from the moon!”: Apollo 11 splashdown, 50 years later</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-send-spacex-to-moon>How much does it cost to send SpaceX to Moon?</h2>
<p>SpaceX’s trip to the Moon will be much longer. The journey to the lunar orbit and back will cover more than 4 lakh kilometres over seven days. Musk has said that the cost will be similar to that of sending an astronaut to the International Space Station, which is roughly $70 million (Rs465 crore), per some estimates.</p>
