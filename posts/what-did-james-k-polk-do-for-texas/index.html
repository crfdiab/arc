<h2 id=what-did-james-k-polk-do-for-texas>What did James K Polk do for Texas?</h2>
<p>Polk is chiefly known for extending the territory of the United States through the Mexican–American War; during his presidency, the United States expanded significantly with the annexation of the Republic of Texas, the Oregon Territory, and the Mexican Cession following the American victory in the Mexican–American War.</p>

<p>war on Mexico<br>
On May 13, 1846, the U.S. Congress overwhelmingly votes in favor of President James K. Polk’s request to declare war on Mexico in a dispute over Texas. Under the threat of war, the United States had refrained from annexing Texas after the latter won independence from Mexico in 1836.</p>

<p>Polk was the only candidate who strongly favored the annexation of Texas in 1844, and he offered an interesting compromise. He appeased Northerners by also advocating the acquisition of the Oregon Territory from the British in present-day Canada—territory which would later form states barring slavery.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-james-kpolk-declare-war-on-mexico>When did James k.polk declare war on Mexico?</h2>
<p>Polk knew it would be seen as an invasion by the Mexican army and set into motion the first shots of the Mexican-American War. Soon, a U.S. patrol was attacked by Mexican troops, and Polk wasted no time in asking Congress for a declaration of war in 1846.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-james-kpolk-live-as-a-child>Where did James k.polk live as a child?</h2>
<p>James Knox Polk was born on November 2, 1795, in a log cabin in Mecklenburg, North Carolina. As a boy, Polk, the eldest of 10 children, moved with his family to Columbia, Tennessee, where his father became a prosperous land surveyor, planter and businessman.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-annexation-of-texas-by-polk>What was the annexation of Texas by Polk?</h2>
<p>Polk accomplished this through the annexation of Texas in 1845, the negotiation of the Oregon Treaty with Great Britain in 1846, and the conclusion of the Mexican-American War in 1848, which ended with the signing and ratification of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in 1848. The Battle of Veracruz.</p>
