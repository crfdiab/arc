<h2 id=what-did-stephen-hawking-discover-about-space>What did Stephen Hawking discover about space?</h2>
<p>Hawking is best known for his discovery that black holes emit radiation which can be detected by special instrumentation. His discovery has made the detailed study of black holes possible. Stephen Hawking was born in Oxford, England on January 8, 1942.</p>
<h2 id=what-inspired-stephen-hawking>What inspired Stephen Hawking?</h2>
<p>Inspired by Roger Penrose’s theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe; and, during 1965, he wrote his thesis on this topic.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-stephen-hawking-want-us-to-leave-earth>Why does Stephen Hawking want us to leave Earth?</h2>
<p>In Brief Answers to the Big Questions, Hawking wrote that humans need to leave the Earth in order to avoid annihilation. Hawking wrote he is worried about the possibility of nuclear war and the devastating effects of climate change. He also said a catastrophic asteroid collision will certainly happen in the future.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-universe-created-based-on-stephen-hawking>How was the universe created based on Stephen Hawking?</h2>
<p>In life, Hawking was a vocal champion of the Big Bang theory — the idea that the universe began by exploding suddenly out of an ultradense singularity smaller than an atom.</p>
<h2 id=can-hawking-radiation-kill-you>Can Hawking radiation kill you?</h2>
<p>Hawking radiation is not deadly because it has never been seen.</p>
<h2 id=what-personality-type-was-stephen-hawking>What personality type was Stephen Hawking?</h2>
<p>As an INTJ, Stephen tends to be confident, analytical, and ambitious. Stephen is likely an independent thinker focused on solving the world’s problems.</p>
<h2 id=does-black-hole-have-gravity>Does black hole have gravity?</h2>
<p>A black hole is an extremely dense object in space from which no light can escape. A black hole’s gravity is so powerful that it will be able to pull in nearby material and “eat” it.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-stephen-hawking-say-is-the-only-chance-of-long-term-survival-for-humans>What does Stephen Hawking say is the only chance of long term survival for humans?</h2>
<p>Stephen Hawking Says Humanity Won’t Survive Without Leaving Earth. “Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space.”</p>
<h2 id=who-is-going-to-take-stephen-hawking-to-space>Who is going to take Stephen Hawking to space?</h2>
<p>Stephen Hawking will travel to space on board Richard Branson’s ship, professor says. ‘I thought no one would take me’, the cosmologist and physicist said. Stephen Hawking is going to go to space. The cosmologist and physicist will leave the Earth on board Richard Branson’s spaceship, he has said.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-stephen-hawking-at-the-explorers-club>When was Stephen Hawking at the Explorers Club?</h2>
<p>NEW YORK — Ambitious plans to carry humans far beyond Earth were at the forefront of the Explorers Club Annual Dinner here Saturday night (March 15), as astronauts, entrepreneurs and physicist Stephen Hawking celebrated the wonder — and necessity — of space exploration.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-documentaries-did-stephen-hawking-appear-in>What kind of documentaries did Stephen Hawking appear in?</h2>
<p>Hawking appeared in documentaries titled The Real Stephen Hawking (2001), Stephen Hawking: Profile (2002) and Hawking (2013), and the documentary series Stephen Hawking, Master of the Universe (2008). Hawking also guest-starred in Futurama and had a recurring role in The Big Bang Theory.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-plane-did-stephen-hawking-fly-on>What kind of plane did Stephen Hawking fly on?</h2>
<p>In 2007, he flew aboard Zero Gravity Corp.’s Boeing 727 aircraft, which takes parabolic paths that allow passengers to experience brief stints of weightlessness. Hawking said at the time that he viewed the flight as a step toward bona-fide space travel.</p>
