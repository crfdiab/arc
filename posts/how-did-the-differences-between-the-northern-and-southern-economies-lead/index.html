<p>In the North, the economy was based on industry. They built factories and manufactured products to sell to other countries and to the southern states. They did not do a lot of farming because the soil was rocky and the colder climate made for a shorter growing season. In the South, the economy was based on agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-war-affect-the-economies-of-both-north-and-south>How did the war affect the economies of both North and South?</h2>
<p>How did the Civil War affect the economies of the North and of the South? The Civil War benefited the Northern economy, but it left the Southern economy in absolutely terrible condition.

<p>The fertile soil and warm climate of the South made it ideal for large-scale farms and crops like tobacco and cotton. Because agriculture was so profitable few Southerners saw a need for industrial development. Eighty percent of the labor force worked on the farm.</p>
