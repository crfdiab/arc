<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-350-and-a-350-rocket>What is the difference between a 350 and a 350 rocket?</h2>
<p>Olds 350 is any engine produced by Oldsmobile from 1968 to 1980 with bore of 4.057, stroke of 3.385 and output of 160-320 hp. Rocket 350 is any Olds 350 engine bearing the “Rocket” name until it was dropped from air cleaner decal in ’75.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-350-rocket-a-good-engine>Is a 350 rocket a good engine?</h2>
<p>GM often mixed and matched its 350s with different make and model cars. However, other than the Cadillac Seville, the Rocket 350 only powered Olds models. Although it was generally a dependable engine, the Rocket 350 suffered from a weak oil system and troublesome valve train.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-horsepower-does-a-350-rocket-motor-have>How much horsepower does a 350 rocket motor have?</h2>
<p>160-325 hp<br>
350. Produced from 1968–1980, the Rocket 350 was entirely different from the other GM divisions’ 350s. It used a very oversquare 4.057 in (103.0 mm) bore and Oldsmobile small-block standard 3.385 in (86.0 mm) stroke for 350 cu in (5.7 L). Output ranged from 160-325 hp (119-242 kW).</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-rebuild-a-350-rocket>How much does it cost to rebuild a 350 rocket?</h2>
<p>$600 to $3,500 depending upon how involved you want to get with the thing. Generally, for a “good” rebuild that doesn’t really get beyond ‘mild 350’ standards, you’re looking at about $1,600-2,500 depending upon location.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-403-olds-a-big-block>Is a 403 Olds a big block?</h2>
<p>The Olds 403 was designed to be a big block in a small-block package. As a result, it has a bore of 4.351 inches (110.5 mm), giving it one of the widest bores of any factory small-block V8.</p>
<h2 id=what-vehicles-came-with-a-350>What vehicles came with a 350?</h2>
<p>However, the 350 later went on to power the Corvette, the Nova, the Caprice, and numerous other vehicles. Buicks, Cadillacs, and Oldsmobiles have all featured the Chevy 350. Figure 3: A 1967 Chevrolet Camaro, one of the first cars to boast a Chevy 350 engine.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-horsepower-does-a-oldsmobile-455-have>How much horsepower does a Oldsmobile 455 have?</h2>
<p>365 hp<br>
Its 455-cu.in. engine, which was introduced in 1968 and featured in the Hurst Olds, Toronado and full-size models, became the standard 4-4-2 powerplant, rated at 365 hp.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-305-worth-rebuilding>Is a 305 worth rebuilding?</h2>
<p>If it needs to go to a machine shop for anything more than tanking, just get a 350. 305 heads are worth rebuilding, even for a 350. A re-build kit is $500, another $500 for machine shop work and then labor/time to rebuild it.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-a-rebuilt-chevy-350-engine-cost>How much does a rebuilt Chevy 350 engine cost?</h2>
<h2 id=is-the-olds-403-a-good-motor>Is the Olds 403 a good motor?</h2>
<p>Overall, the Olds 403 is a good motor. It’s reliable when maintained, and has a surprising amount of torque for a stock smog small block.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-oldsmobile-350-a-rocket-or-a-regular-350>Is the Oldsmobile 350 a rocket or a regular 350?</h2>
<p>If the bore is larger than 4.057 inches, then its not a stock* olds 350. Some oldsmobile cars offered a 350 oldsmobile or buick 350 engine. I’m guessing Oldsmobile wasn’t gonna call their low horsepower 2bbl 350 a rocket when they have the high horsepower 4bbl 350 sitting in the same chassis.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-350-rocket-and-350-small-block>What’s the difference between a 350 Rocket and 350 small block?</h2>
<p>Olds small blocks (260-403 cid) all have a 3.385 inch stroke. Olds achieves more displacement by applying different bore diameters .The 350 rocket has a 4.057 inch bore. Chevy 350 has a 3.48 inch stroke with a 4.000 inch bore.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-an-olds-or-a-rocket>Which is better an Olds or a rocket?</h2>
<p>ALL 307 to 455 super duper 442 or hurst are ROCKET ENGINES. George is right. If it’s an Olds, it’s a Rocket. Ride a Rocket!! OLDS =*a left handed chevy* They have many differences, chevy being generally the better choice for performance builds.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-oldsmobile-start-making-the-rocket-engine>When did Oldsmobile start making the rocket engine?</h2>
<p>by Rob Wagner. General Motors-owned Oldsmobile produced the Rocket 350-cubic-inch V-8 engine from 1968 to 1980. The Olds V-8 was unrelated to other GM 350 V-8s. GM often mixed and matched its 350s with different make and model cars.</p>
