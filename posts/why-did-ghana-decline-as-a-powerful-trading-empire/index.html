<h2 id=why-did-ghana-decline-as-a-powerful-trading-empire>Why did Ghana decline as a powerful trading empire?</h2>
<p>In the 1060s, a Muslim group called the ​Almoravids​ attacked Ghana in an effort to force its leaders to convert to Islam. The Almoravids weakened Ghana’s empire and cut off many trade routes. Without its trade, Ghana could not support its empire, and the empire eventually fell.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-decline-of-ancient-africa>What caused the decline of ancient Africa?</h2>
<p>After the death of Mansa Musa, no ruler was powerful or influential enough to hold the vast empire together [i] Mali’s power was eventually weakened by a lack of orderly succession of imperial power, and by the desire of smaller states to break free to reap the benefits of the salt and gold trade[ii].</p>
<h2 id=what-were-two-of-the-most-important-factors-in-ghanas-rise-to-power>What were two of the most important factors in Ghana’s rise to power?</h2>
<p>military strength, control of trade routes, and increase in capital and wealth. As trade increased, so did Ghana’s size.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-reason-for-the-fall-of-the-ghana-empire>What was the reason for the fall of the Ghana Empire?</h2>
<p>Several factors led to the decline, which began around the year 1076, and the eventual fall of the Ghana Empire. Let’s have a look at some of these influences. As a result of trade with Muslim merchants, the Islamic religion spread throughout the Ghana Empire, among the local traders in the interior and the elite in the metropolis.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-king-of-ghana-regain-power>When did the king of Ghana regain power?</h2>
<p>Ghana’s king later regained power in 1087, but the old empire had broken apart. The loss of Natural Resourcesput a strain on Ghana’s great population. The disapperance of Ghana opened the way to the rise of a new empire, called Mali. 192021</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-soninke-empire-of-ghana-fall>Why did the Soninke Empire of Ghana fall?</h2>
<p>The Soninke people of Ancient Ghana were as a result pushed further south, into the more forest lush areas of Africa. The Ghana empire ended more than a 1000 years ago. It was located to the north west of present day Ghana. I would list just two of the factors. Invasion by Armed Arabs on Camel-back (the Almoravids) in their quest to spread Islam.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-gold-mining-industry-decline-in-ghana>Why did the gold mining industry decline in Ghana?</h2>
<p>Trade declined after the gold mining decreased, so there was no income coming in. There were many competitors in the gold mining trade industry that were trying to overcome Ghana in wealth and power. There were enviornmental issues, such as a drought and the animals starving from the drought.</p>
