<h2 id=how-much-is-1-shilling-and-6-pence>How much is 1 shilling and 6 pence?</h2>
<p>Before Decimal Day in 1971 there were 240 pence in one pound sterling. Twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound. Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence, e.g. forty-two pence would be three shillings and six pence (3/6), pronounced “three and six”.</p>
<h2 id=are-sixpence-coins-worth-anything>Are sixpence coins worth anything?</h2>
<p>Valuable coins to look out for Do look out for pre-1947 sixpences in the collection: they are more valuable coins as they contain silver. Sixpences minted between 1920 and 1946 were struck in 50% silver. Those struck before 1920 are made of 92.5% silver, so accordingly are worth almost double.</p>

<p>Value of a shilling in pence A popular value was ‘three and six’ (meaning three shillings and six pence) which was actually 42 pence (3 x 12 = 36, plus six pence = 42).</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-is-5-and-6-pence>How much money is 5 and 6 pence?</h2>
<p>“Five and six” means five shillings and sixpence and would be written 5/6. £4 8s. signifies four pounds, eight shillings.</p>

<p>Although a few of the big shops will accept Euro, it is rarely used across Britain. Since decimalisation in 1971 , the pound has been divided into 100 pence. ) is made up of 100 pence (p) exactly like the dollar is split into 100 cents. The singular of pence is “penny”.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-value-of-a-sixpence-in-pounds>What is the value of a sixpence in pounds?</h2>
<p>A sixpence is the equivalent of about 50 cents in 2014 dollars (28.8 pence in British terms). However, the British have not used sixpence for currency since the early 1970s. In 1971, the British switched over to a currency system based on tens.</p>

<p>A shilling was 12 pence (what the United States considers pennies). A sixpence was half a shilling, so as the name implies, it represented six pence. In other words, a pound had 240 pence in it. In the current system, a pound has 100 pence in it, just as a U.S. dollar has 100 pennies.</p>
