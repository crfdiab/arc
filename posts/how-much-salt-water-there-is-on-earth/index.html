<h2 id=how-much-salt-water-there-is-on-earth>How much salt water there is on Earth?</h2>
<p>One estimate of global water distribution</p>
<table><tr><th>Water source</th><th>Water volume, in cubic miles</th><th>Percent of total water</th></tr><tr><td>Ice caps, Glaciers, & Permanent Snow</td><td>5,773,000</td><td>1.74</td></tr><tr><td>Groundwater</td><td>5,614,000</td><td>1.69</td></tr><tr><td>Fresh</td><td>2,526,000</td><td>0.76</td></tr><tr><td>Saline</td><td>3,088,000</td><td>0.93</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=is-there-more-salt-than-water-on-earth>Is there more salt than water on Earth?</h2>
<p>You may know that the oceans cover about 70 percent of the of Earth’s surface, and that about 97 percent of all water on and in the Earth is saline—there’s a lot of salty water on our planet.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-water-on-earth>Where is the water on Earth?</h2>
<p>Earth’s water is (almost) everywhere: above the Earth in the air and clouds, on the surface of the Earth in rivers, oceans, ice, plants, in living organisms, and inside the Earth in the top few miles of the ground.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-sea-is-salty>Why the sea is salty?</h2>
<p>Salt in the sea, or ocean salinity, is mainly caused by rain washing mineral ions from the land into water. Carbon dioxide in the air dissolves into rainwater, making it slightly acidic. When rain falls, it weathers rocks, releasing mineral salts that separate into ions.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-saltiest-fast-food>What is the saltiest fast food?</h2>
<p>1. Pizza Hut. The saltiest fast-food menu item in America right now is the Meat Lovers 9” Personal PANormous Pizza from Pizza Hut, with an insane 3,670 milligrams of sodium; that’s more than 1,000 milligrams more than the daily recommended allowance.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-has-the-saltiest-food>What country has the saltiest food?</h2>
<p>Canada<br>
Canada Has The Saltiest Food Across The Globe, According To New Study – Narcity.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-of-the-earths-water-is-salt-water>How much of the earth’s water is salt water?</h2>
<p>Salt water has different kinds of salt in it, but it mostly has sodium chloride, the same salt we add to our food. Just 3.5 percent of the water on Earth is fresh water we can drink. And most of that fresh water, 68 percent, is trapped in ice and glaciers. A third of the fresh water is in the ground. We call it groundwater.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trillions-of-gallons-is-there-on-earth>How many trillions of gallons is there on Earth?</h2>
<p>That’s still thousands of trillions of gallons, but it’s a very small amount compared to all the water available. The rest of the water on the planet is either floating in the air as clouds and water vapor, or is locked up in plants and animals (your body is 65 percent water, so if you weigh 100 pounds, 65 pounds of you is water!).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-ratio-of-salt-water-to-fresh-water>What is the ratio of salt water to fresh water?</h2>
<p>Water with a salinity between this level and 1‰ is typically referred to as marginal water because it is marginal for many uses by humans and animals. The ratio of salt water to fresh water on Earth is around 50 to 1. The planet’s fresh water is also very unevenly distributed.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-volume-of-water-on-earth>How big is the volume of water on Earth?</h2>
<p>The volume comes to about 2,551,100 mi 3 (10,633,450 km 3 ), of which 99 percent is groundwater, much of which is not accessible to humans. The diameter of this sphere is about 169.5 miles (272.8 kilometers). Do you notice the “tiny” bubble over Atlanta, Georgia? That one represents fresh water in all the lakes and rivers on the planet.</p>
