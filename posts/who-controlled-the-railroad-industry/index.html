<h2 id=who-controlled-the-railroad-industry>Who controlled the railroad industry?</h2>
<p>Eight months after the United States enters World War I on behalf of the Allies, President Woodrow Wilson announces the nationalization of a large majority of the country’s railroads under the Federal Possession and Control Act.</p>
<h2 id=who-owned-most-of-the-railroad-industry>Who owned most of the railroad industry?</h2>
<p>He was thirty-five years old when the first locomotive was put into use in America. When he died, railroads had become the greatest force in modern industry, and Vanderbilt was the richest man in Europe or America, and the largest owner of railroads in the world.</p>
<h2 id=which-industry-was-most-impacted-by-railroads-in-the-late-19th-century>Which industry was most impacted by railroads in the late 19th century?</h2>
<p>The railroads were the largest single market for steel, which went into their locomotives and track, and they relied on coal as their principal fuel.</p>
<h2 id=who-owned-railroads-in-the-industrial-revolution>Who owned railroads in the industrial revolution?</h2>
<p>The railroad was first developed in Great Britain. A man named George Stephenson successfully applied the steam technology of the day and created the world’s first successful locomotive. The first engines used in the United States were purchased from the Stephenson Works in England.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-railroads-grow-so-quickly-in-the-late-19th-century>Why did the railroads grow so quickly in the late 19th century?</h2>
<p>The railroads helped industrialize the country both by creating demand for things like steel and by linking various parts of the country to create a bigger market. But these were not the only factors. There also political factors. The government was very pro-business and put few limitations on its growth.</p>
<h2 id=who-built-americas-railroads>Who built America’s railroads?</h2>
<p>From 1863 and 1869, roughly 15,000 Chinese workers helped build the transcontinental railroad. They were paid less than American workers and lived in tents, while white workers were given accommodation in train cars.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-tycoons-of-the-railroad-industry>Who are the tycoons of the railroad industry?</h2>
<p>Railroad Tycoons. Railroad tycoons were the early industrial pioneers amassing or overseeing construction of many large railroads through the early 20th century. These men, names like James Hill, Jay and George Gould, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Edward Harriman, and Collis P. Huntington are largely responsible for building much of the country’s network.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-railroad-important-in-the-late-19th-century>Why was the railroad important in the late 19th century?</h2>
<p>Life in the camps was often very crude and rough. By 1900, much of the nation’s railroad system was in place. The railroad opened the way for the settlement of the West, provided new economic opportunities, stimulated the development of town and communities, and generally tied the country together.</p>

<h2 id=who-are-the-robber-barons-of-the-19th-century>Who are the robber barons of the 19th century?</h2>
<p>John D. Rockefeller controlled much of the American oil industry during the late 19th century and his business tactics made him one of the most notorious of the robber barons.</p>
