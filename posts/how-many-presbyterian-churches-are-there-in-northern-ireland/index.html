<p>Membership. The Church has a membership of approximately 225,000 people in 536 congregations in 403 charges across both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-ulster-presbyterian>What is an Ulster Presbyterian?</h2>
<p>Many Ulster Protestants are descendants of settlers who arrived in the early 17th century Ulster Plantation. Many more Scottish Protestant migrants arrived in Ulster in the late 17th century. Those who came from Scotland were mostly Presbyterians, while those from England were mostly Anglicans.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-different-about-the-presbyterian-church>What is different about the Presbyterian Church?</h2>
<p>Characteristics. Presbyterians distinguish themselves from other denominations by doctrine, institutional organisation (or “church order”) and worship; often using a “Book of Order” to regulate common practice and order. The origins of the Presbyterian churches are in Calvinism.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-catholic-and-presbyterian>What is the difference between Catholic and Presbyterian?</h2>
<p>The difference between Presbyterian and Catholic is that Presbyterianism is a reformed tradition from Protestantism. In contrast, Catholicism is the Christian methodology, where Catholicism implies the Roman Catholic Church. Presbyterian believes that, a priority of Scriptures, faith in God.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-free-presbyterians-believe-in>What do Free Presbyterians believe in?</h2>
<p>Beliefs</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamental in Doctrine, believing in the divine authority and verbal inspiration of the Bible, and the great fundamental doctrines of grace it contains.</li>
<li>Evangelical in Outreach, in obedience to the great commission of Christ to “go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel”.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=do-free-presbyterians-drink-alcohol>Do Free Presbyterians drink alcohol?</h2>
<p>While most Presbyterian churches accept moderate drinking, the current Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America constitution advises that, “it is altogether wise and proper that Christians refrain from the use, sale and manufacture of alcoholic beverages.”</p>
<h2 id=do-presbyterians-get-baptized>Do Presbyterians get baptized?</h2>
<p>CLASS. Presbyterians believe that baptism is one of the two sacred acts, or sacraments, instituted by God for his followers. Presbyterian churches follow some common practices for baptism, including the belief that baptism by immersion is not necessary.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-free-presbyterian-church-of-ulster-live>Where does the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster live?</h2>
<p>Most of its members live in Northern Ireland, where the church is headquartered, and in County Donegal. The church has additional congregations in the Republic of Ireland, Great Britain and Australia, and a sister denomination in North America that has congregations in Canada and the United States.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-current-moderator-of-the-presbyterian-church-of-ulster>Who is the current Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Ulster?</h2>
<p>John Armstrong is the current Deputy Moderator. The Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster began on 17 March 1951 ( St Patrick’s Day) as the result of a conflict between some members of the local Lissara Presbyterian congregation in Crossgar, County Down, Northern Ireland, and the Down Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-the-presbyterian-church-in-ireland>What was the history of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Conservative and evangelical in theology, they are mainly unionist in politics. Yet one of the paradoxes of their history is that they were the main originators of modern Irish Republicanism in the United Irish movement of the late eighteenth century, which led to the rebellion of 1798 in which many Ulster Presbyterians fought as rebels.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-of-the-ulster-protestants>What was the religion of the Ulster Protestants?</h2>
<p>There were tensions between the two main groups of Ulster Protestants; Scottish Protestant migrants to Ulster were mostly Presbyterian and English Protestants mostly Anglican. The Penal Laws discriminated against both Catholics and Presbyterians, in an attempt to force them to accept the state religion, the Anglican Church of Ireland.</p>
