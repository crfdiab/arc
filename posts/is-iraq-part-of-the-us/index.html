<h2 id=is-iraq-part-of-the-us>Is Iraq part of the US?</h2>
<p>According to the preamble of the convention, “the United States of America recognizes Iraq as an independent State.” In this treaty, the U.S. also acknowledged that “special relations” existed between the U.K. and Iraq because the latter was a mandate under British protection according to the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-us-in-war-with-iraq>Is the US in war with Iraq?</h2>
<p>The US became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition; the insurgency and many dimensions of the armed conflict continue. The invasion occurred as part of the George W. Bush administration’s War on Terror following the September 11 attacks despite no connection of the latter to Iraq.</p>
