<p>Seminole Wars<br>
The Seminole Wars (also known as the Florida Wars) were three related military conflicts in Florida between the United States and the Seminole, citizens of a Native American nation which formed in the region during the early 18th century.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-us-fight-seminole-indians>Why did the US fight Seminole Indians?</h2>
<p>The First Seminole War (1817–18) began over attempts by U.S. authorities to recapture runaway black slaves living among Seminole bands. Under General Andrew Jackson, U.S. military forces invaded the area, scattering the villagers, burning their towns, and seizing Spanish-held Pensacola and St. Marks.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-florida-conflict>Who was involved in the Florida conflict?</h2>
<p>First Seminole War, conflict between U.S. armed forces and the Seminole Indians of Florida that is generally dated to 1817–18 and that led Spain to cede Florida to the United States. The Seminoles were largely of Creek origin and lived in villages in northern Florida.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-seminoles-fighting-against>Who were the Seminoles fighting against?</h2>
<p>The Second Seminole War (1835-1842), usually referred to as the Seminole War proper, was the fiercest war waged by the U.S. government against American Indians. The United States spent more than $20 million fighting the Seminoles. The war left more than 1,500 soldiers and uncounted American civilians dead.</p>

<p>The Second Seminole War, also known as the Florida War, was a conflict from 1835 to 1842 in Florida between various groups of Native Americans collectively known as Seminoles and the United States, part of a series of conflicts called the Seminole Wars.</p>
<h2 id=what-indians-resisted-the-removal-act>What Indians resisted the removal act?</h2>
