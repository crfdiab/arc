<p>Ships (with a few exceptions) are charged a toll based on their weight. The average toll for a ship to travel the canal is $150,000, but it can get much more expensive for the largest ships and additional surcharges. 15. The cheapest toll ever paid to travel the canal was 36 cents in 1928 by Richard Halliburton, who swam the length of the canal.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-the-panama-canal-toll-was-paid>When was the last time the Panama Canal toll was paid?</h2>
<p>The toll was paid by the Mitsui O.S.K. Lines-operated MOL Benefactor for a northbound transit of the canal on July 1, 2016, the Panama Canal Authority has confirmed. The previous toll record was paid by the COSCO Shipping Panama for its inaugural transit of expanded locks to the tune of $575,545.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-are-the-locks-on-the-panama-canal-switched>How often are the locks on the Panama Canal switched?</h2>
<p>The locks each have two lanes that allow multiple ships to pass through at a time, but they cannot handle large vessels going opposite directions. In the day time, the direction of the locks are switched every 6 hours and priority is given to larger ships. This way large ships can complete their journey in the 8-10 hour timeframe.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-revenue-from-the-panama-canal-come-from>Where does the revenue from the Panama Canal come from?</h2>
<p>Tolls account for roughly 80 percent of the Panama Canal’s revenue. The Panama Canal is an artificial waterway of approximately 80 kilometers (around 50 miles) between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, located in the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
