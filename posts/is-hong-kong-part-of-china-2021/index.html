<h2 id=is-hong-kong-part-of-china-2021>Is Hong Kong part of China 2021?</h2>
<p>Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, with executive, legislative, and judicial powers devolved from the national government.</p>
<h2 id=was-hong-kong-originally-a-part-of-china>Was Hong Kong originally a part of China?</h2>
<p>When Did Hong Kong Separate from China? Hong Kong was ceded by China after its loss to Great Britain during the Opium Wars, which lasted from 1839 to 1860. In 1997, Britain returned Hong Kong to China as a Special Administrative Region.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-was-the-agreement-between-china-and-hong-kong>How long was the agreement between China and Hong Kong?</h2>
<p>The lease was negotiated between the UK and the Guangxu Emperor of China, and was for a period of 99 years starting from 1 July 1898 under the Second Convention of Peking.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hong-kong-become-a-part-of-china>When did Hong Kong become a part of China?</h2>
<p>This declaration stipulated that Hong Kong would become a part of China on July 1, 1997, but that the “current social and economic systems” and “life-style” in Hong Kong would remain the same for 50 years.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-hong-kong-olympic-team-part-of-china>Is the Hong Kong Olympic team part of China?</h2>
<p>While most Hong Kongers consider themselves Chinese, they do not consider themselves a part of China. They even have their own Olympic team, anthem, and flag.​. Hong Kong was never an independent country. Until 1997, and the Hong Kong handover, Hong Kong was a colony of the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-prime-minister-when-hong-kong-came-under-one-country-two-systems>Who was Prime Minister when Hong Kong came under one country, two systems?</h2>
<p>However, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ultimately didn’t think that those two regions would be able to survive on their own, says Steve Tsang, director of the University of London’s SOAS China Institute. After all, Hong Kong’s airport—Shek Kong Airfield—was in the section above Boundary Street that the British had to return.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-british-do-with-hong-kong>What did the British do with Hong Kong?</h2>
<p>Britain’s new colony flourished as an East-West trading center and as the commercial gateway and distribution center for southern China. In 1898, Britain was granted an additional 99 years of rule over Hong Kong under the Second Convention of Peking.</p>
