<h2 id=where-do-the-wyandot-live>Where do the Wyandot live?</h2>
<p>The Wyandots are original residents of the St. Lawrence Valley in Quebec. Some Wyandot people still live there today, in the Huron-Wendat First Nation. Many other Wyandots fled to Ohio and Michigan after a defeat by the Iroquois.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-huron-indians-now>Where are the Huron Indians now?</h2>
<p>The Huron gradually reestablished some influence in Ohio and Michigan, but the U.S. government eventually forced tribal members to sell their lands. They subsequently migrated to Kansas and then to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma).</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-huron-tribe-live>Where did the Huron tribe live?</h2>
<p>The Wyandot or Huron are an Iroquoian-speaking people made up of a number of bands, whose ancestral lands were in southern Ontario, Canada. They later moved to Michigan, Ohio, Kansas, and Oklahoma.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-wyandot-indian-tribe-eat>What did the Wyandot Indian Tribe eat?</h2>
<p>Wyandot women harvested corn, beans, squash, and sunflowers. Wyandot men hunted deer, wild turkeys, and small game, and went fishing in the rivers. Wyandot recipes included cornbread, soups, and stews. Here is a website with more information about Native American Indian food.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-homes-did-the-wyandot-indians-have>What type of homes did the Wyandot Indians have?</h2>
<p>The Wyandot Indians lived in villages of longhouses, which were large wood-frame houses covered with sheets of bark. One Wyandot house could be 150 feet long, and an entire clan lived in it–up to 60 people! Many Wyandot villages had palisades (reinforced walls) around them for protection.</p>
<h2 id=are-huron-and-wyandot-indians-the-same>Are Huron and Wyandot Indians the same?</h2>
<p>The Huron name is usually referred to those who were of importance to the Canadians. The Wyandot name specifically refers to those Hurons who moved to the southeastern area of Detroit in the United States. As a matter of fact, the city of Wyandot, Michigan has a picture of the Wyandot/Huron Indians at the entrance of the city.</p>
<h2 id=were-did-the-wyandot-tribe-live>Were did the Wyandot tribe live?</h2>
<p>There are two Wyandot communities in the United States–one in Oklahoma and one in Kansas –and a third community in Quebec, Canada . A Wyandot community is known as a tribe in the US and a First Nation in Canada.</p>
