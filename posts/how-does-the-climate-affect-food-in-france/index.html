<h2 id=how-does-the-climate-affect-food-in-france>How does the climate affect food in France?</h2>
<p>Extreme weather conditions can strongly affect agricultural production, with negative impacts that can at times be detected at regional scales. In France, crop yields were greatly influenced by drought and heat stress in 2003 and by extremely wet conditions in 2007.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-frances-climate>What is France’s climate?</h2>
<p>France’s climate is temperate, but divided into four distinct climatic areas.
