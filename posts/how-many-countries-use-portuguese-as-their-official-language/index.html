<h2 id=how-many-countries-use-portuguese-as-their-official-language>How many countries use Portuguese as their official language?</h2>
<p>nine<br>
The Community of Portuguese Language Countries (in Portuguese Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa, with the Portuguese acronym CPLP) consists of the nine independent countries that have Portuguese as an official language: Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique.</p>
<h2 id=what-languages-influenced-portuguese>What languages influenced Portuguese?</h2>
<p>In all aspects—phonology, morphology, lexicon and syntax—Portuguese is essentially the result of an organic evolution of Vulgar Latin with some influences from other languages, namely the native Gallaecian and Lusitanian languages spoken prior to the Roman domination.</p>
<h2 id=is-portuguese-influenced-by-french>Is Portuguese influenced by French?</h2>
<p>Another language that greatly influenced the Portuguese language was French. This was because of the introduction of French manners and customs in Portugal during the tenth and eleventh centuries, when the French immigrated to Portugal. Many Frenchmen traveled to Portugal in these times.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-the-most-portuguese-speaking-people>Which country has the most Portuguese-speaking people?</h2>
<p>Brazil<br>
Brazil. With a population of over 205 million, Brazil is by far the world’s largest Portuguese-speaking nation and the only one in the Americas. Portuguese was introduced during the Portuguese colonial period.</p>
<h2 id=what-nationality-makes-portuguese>What nationality makes Portuguese?</h2>
<p>The Portuguese people are a Romance nation and ethnic group indigenous to Portugal who share a common Portuguese culture, ancestry and language.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-influences-did-the-portuguese-have>What kind of influences did the Portuguese have?</h2>
<p>Due to local influences, Portuguese adopted a few words like jangada (“raft”) of Malay origin, and chá (“tea”), of Chinese origin. Another language that greatly influenced the Portuguese language was French.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-language-of-portugal-come-from>Where does the language of Portugal come from?</h2>
<p>The Portuguese Language The Portuguese language is one of the major languages of the world. It is derived from Latin, which makes it a Romance language. It came specifically from the language of Latium in Ancient Italy, or more specifically, the city of Rome.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-people-of-portugal-do-for-a-living>What did the people of Portugal do for a living?</h2>
<p>Daguerre and Niépce had just created the first permanent image; Talbot had invented the calotype; and an inspired José Relvas decided he needed more than a mere camera — so the Portuguese inventor, engineer, and traveler built his own temple dedicated to photography.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-age-of-discovery-do-to-portugal>What did the age of discovery do to Portugal?</h2>
<p>The Age of Discoveries was not just sunshine and roses. It was during this period that the Portuguese started the Transatlantic slave trade, taking people unwillingly from Africa to work on Brazilian plantations — a trade which other European powers were quick to follow, changing forever the world’s economy and cultural habits.</p>
