<h2 id=what-plants-and-animals-live-in-watersheds>What plants and animals live in watersheds?</h2>
<p>Beavers, fish, shore birds, frogs, turtles and snakes are among the aquatic species of wildlife that live in or around the water supplied by a watershed.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-animal-species-known-to-live-in-the-watershed>What are two animal species known to live in the watershed?</h2>
<p>Bats are common throughout the watershed and include nine species. Most mammals within the watershed are forest inhabitants and include species such as chipmunks (Tamias striatus), deer mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) and black bear (Ursus americanus).</p>
<h2 id=what-can-be-found-in-a-watershed>What can be found in a watershed?</h2>
<p>What is a Watershed? A watershed is the area of land that drains surface water and groundwater to a common water body, such as a creek, stream, lake or the ocean. We all live in a watershed, regardless of how far we are from a body of water; therefore, the activities we do on land impact our water quality.</p>
<h2 id=what-types-of-organisms-live-in-ponds>What types of organisms live in ponds?</h2>
<p>Ponds are smaller than lakes, but are still capable of nurturing plenty of life forms. Apart from pond plants and weeds, we can also find various types of bacteria and microscopic creatures, fish, insects, amphibians (such as toads or frogs), birds, reptiles (cold-blooded animals) and mammals (warm-blooded animals).</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-without-watersheds>What would happen without watersheds?</h2>
<p>Unhealthy watersheds affect wildlife. The polluted water supply that results can become harmful to humans. If the water picks up enough soil over time, the land along that stream will become unstable and eventually erode away. If you live along a river bank, this could mean losing your backyard.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-watershed-important-to-wildlife>Why are watershed important to wildlife?</h2>
<p>Healthy watersheds provide many ecosystem services including, but not limited to: nutrient cycling, carbon storage, erosion/sedimentation control, increased biodiversity, soil formation, wildlife movement corridors, water storage, water filtration, flood control, food, timber and recreation, as well as reduced …</p>
<h2 id=where-do-most-organisms-live-in-a-pond>Where do most organisms live in a pond?</h2>
<p>In lakes and ponds, much of the species diversity is concentrated in the littoral zone, near the shore, where algae and plants thrive in the abundant light needed for photosynthesis. Living within the plant matter is a cornucopia of animals including snails, amphibians, crustaceans, insects, and fish.</p>

<li>1.1.2 2) Dragonfly Larvae.</li>
<li>1.1.3 3) Stonefly Larvae.</li>

<li>1.1.8 8) Caddisfly Larvae.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-important-are-watershed-to-humans>How important are watershed to humans?</h2>
<p>A healthy watershed protects water supplies, nurtures forests, plants, and wildlife, keeps soil fertile, and supports self-reliant communities. Large and sudden changes to a watershed, such as clearing trees and brush, dumping waste, or building roads, houses, and dams, can damage the watershed and its water resources.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-live-in-the-watershed>What kind of animals live in the watershed?</h2>
<p>The watershed is home to a wide variety of plants and animals that are native to the area, as well as introduced species. The native forest is dominated by white pine and mixed hardwoods, including red and white oak; sugar, red and silver maple; white ash, hickories and walnuts.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-trees-live-in-the-watershed>What kind of trees live in the watershed?</h2>
<p>The native forest is dominated by white pine and mixed hardwoods, including red and white oak; sugar, red and silver maple; white ash, hickories and walnuts. Other trees of note include swamp white oak, American elm, Eastern hemlock, Atlantic white cedar and green ash.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-watershed-affect-the-aquatic-ecosystem>How does a watershed affect the aquatic ecosystem?</h2>
<p>The materials that reach a river or lake through the watershed affect the chemical and physical environment in which a complex association of plants, animals and microorganisms exist. These interrelated organisms and their environment are referred to as the aquatic ecosystem. The watershed is part of this ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-watersheds>What do you need to know about watersheds?</h2>
<p>management of a natural resource to prevent exploitation, destruction, or neglect. entire river system or an area drained by a river and its tributaries. use of land, forest, and water resources in ways that do not harm the plants and animals living in a watershed.</p>
