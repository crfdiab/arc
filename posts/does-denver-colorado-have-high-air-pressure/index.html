<h2 id=does-denver-colorado-have-high-air-pressure>Does Denver Colorado have high air pressure?</h2>
<p>For example, Denver, Colorado is about 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) above sea level. The atmospheric pressure of Denver drops to 0.85 kilograms per square centimeter (12 pounds per square inch) at this altitude.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-normal-barometric-pressure-for-denver>What is the normal barometric pressure for Denver?</h2>
<p>A typical barometric pressure in Denver, Colorado, is 615 mm Hg.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-air-pressure-reading-for-denver-co>What is the air pressure reading for Denver CO?</h2>
<p>Currently</p>
<table><tr><th></th><th>30.19in Barometer 30% Humidity Variable 6.9mph Wind</th></tr><tr><td>Partly Cloudy</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-city-has-the-highest-air-pressure>What city has the highest air pressure?</h2>
<p>In the contiguous U.S. the highest barometric reading is 1064 millibars which was measured at Miles City, Montana, on December 24, 1983. This strong area of high pressure brought one of the coldest Christmas holiday’s for much of the country east of the Rockies.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-less-air-in-denver>Is there less air in Denver?</h2>
<p>Denver really is a mile high, but most people don’t even notice the altitude difference. The air is just thinner and dryer. In fact, many people with respiratory problems move to Denver for the benefits of the dry air. Follow these tips to stay happy and healthy.</p>
<h2 id=how-should-the-air-pressure-change-if-you-were-in-denver-colorado>How should the air pressure change if you were in Denver Colorado?</h2>
<p>How should the air pressure change if you were in Denver, Colorado, which is 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) above sea level? The atmospheric pressure and altitude are inversely proportional, therefore as one moves away from sea level (increasing altitude) the atmospheric pressure decreases.</p>
<h2 id=how-should-air-pressure-change-if-you-are-in-denver-colorado>How should air pressure change if you are in Denver Colorado?</h2>
<h2 id=what-is-the-driest-month-in-colorado>What is the driest month in Colorado?</h2>
<p>February<br>
The driest month in Denver is February with 0.49 inches of precipitation, and with 2.32 inches May is the wettest month….Average Rainfall for Denver.</p>
<table><tr><th>Month</th><th>Precipitation</th></tr><tr><td>Feb</td><td>0.49in.</td></tr><tr><td>Mar</td><td>1.28in.</td></tr><tr><td>Apr</td><td>1.93in.</td></tr><tr><td>May</td><td>2.32in.</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-strongest-pressure-in-the-world>What is the strongest pressure in the world?</h2>
<p>1083.8mb<br>
The highest barometric pressure ever recorded was 1083.8mb (32 in) at Agata, Siberia, Russia (alt. 262m or 862ft) on 31 December 1968. This pressure corresponds to being at an altitude of nearly 600 m (2,000 ft) below sea level!</p>
<h2 id=can-you-breathe-in-high-air-pressure>Can you breathe in high air pressure?</h2>
<p>In order for your lungs to breathe air in without duress, the pressure has to be higher outside your body. But at high altitudes, the outside air pressure is lower than it is inside your lungs, making it more difficult to pull in the thinner air and for your veins to pump oxygen throughout the body.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-air-pressure-in-denver-colorado>What is the air pressure in Denver Colorado?</h2>
<p>With that standard the pressure at Denver is 12.1 PSI or a barometer of about 24.63. At this pressure water boils at about 202F instead of 212F. Loading…</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-highest-air-pressure-ever-recorded>What was the highest air pressure ever recorded?</h2>
<p>The highest barometer reading ever recorded is about 32 inches or just over 15.6 PSI. The lowest barometer reading ever recorded was 25.69 in the middle of a hurricane so this is not typical but equates to about 12.5 PSI. These are all sea level readings. So we need an average, or normal.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-air-pressure-measured-in-the-air>How is air pressure measured in the air?</h2>
<p>Air pressure is measured in different ways. Two common ones are PSI (pounds per square inch) or a barometer which measures in column inches of Mercury. As we know the barometer goes up and down with weather so the air pressure goes up and down.</p>
