<h2 id=what-did-the-puritans-turn-into>What did the Puritans turn into?</h2>
<p>Some Puritan ideals, including the formal rejection of Roman Catholicism, were incorporated into the doctrines of the Church of England; others were absorbed into the many Protestant denominations that emerged in the late 17th and early 18th centuries in North America and Britain.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-puritans-organize-their-society>How did Puritans organize their society?</h2>
<p>How did the Puritans organize their settlements? Puritans typically lived in compact villages clustered around a community meeting house where they met to worship and discuss local issues. These town meetings provided important experience in self-government.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-puritans-oppose-the-church-of-england>Why did the Puritans oppose the Church of England?</h2>
<p>Puritans were generally members of the Church of England who believed that the Church of England was insufficiently reformed, retaining too much of its Roman Catholic doctrinal roots, and who therefore opposed royal ecclesiastical policy under Elizabeth I of England, James I of England, and Charles I of England.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-the-puritans-in-north-america>What was the history of the Puritans in North America?</h2>

<p>Bremer says that Puritans don’t deserve their reputation as hopeless killjoys. They weren’t any more repressed or judgmental than other Christian sects of their day, but when 19th-century Europeans and Americans started rebelling against the legitimately repressive mores of the Victorian Era, they tried to pin it on the Puritans.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-england-during-the-puritan-movement>Who was the King of England during the Puritan movement?</h2>
<p>The Church of England. Through the reigns of the Protestant King Edward VI (1547-1553), who introduced the first vernacular prayer book, and the Catholic (1553-1558), who sent some dissenting clergymen to their deaths and others into exile, the Puritan movement–whether tolerated or suppressed–continued to grow.</p>
