<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-boat-from-clearwater-to-key-west>How long does it take to boat from Clearwater to Key West?</h2>
<p>however, plan on approximately 3.5 hours between ports.</p>
<h2 id=does-sanibel-have-clear-water>Does Sanibel have clear water?</h2>
<p>Sanibel is a popular beach getaway for all the stressed-out people in South Florida. But now there is something to get stressed out about in Sanibel: murky water along the beachfront. One side has clear water, the other has brown water near the shoreline.</p>
<h2 id=is-clearwater-trashy>Is Clearwater trashy?</h2>
<p>Clearwater beach isn’t trashy per say, but is big built up and busy. The beach is fab as are some of the local restaurants. Some good hotels too. Sand Key is nice but not near the main action so might not be great if you wanted to walk out at night.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-drive-from-tampa-to-key-west>How long is the drive from Tampa to Key West?</h2>
<p>The distance between Tampa and Key West is 239 miles. The road distance is 422.7 miles. How do I travel from Tampa to Key West without a car? The best way to get from Tampa to Key West without a car is to bus which takes 9h 55m and costs . How long does it take to get from Tampa to Key West?</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-drive-from-miami-to-key-west>How long is the drive from Miami to Key West?</h2>
<p>But it is the bridges, sloping above the blue green water, that steal the show. The longest, the Seven Mile Bridge, gives drivers the truest sense that they are heading out to sea. From Miami, the drive will take around 3 hours, from Ft. Lauderdale a little closer to 4 hours.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-fastest-way-to-the-florida-keys>Which is the fastest way to the Florida Keys?</h2>
<p>The Florida Turnpike is the fastest route to the entrance to the Florida Keys. Update: The Florida Turnpike no longer has toll plazas (since February 19, 2011.) Instead, you will be charged tolls via your license plate, unless you have a SunPass device.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-speed-limit-from-florida-to-key-west>What’s the speed limit from Florida to Key West?</h2>
<p>When you get to the southern end of the Florida Turnpike, you will then take US 1 all the way to Key West. Take your time on this drive. The speed limits are strictly enforced, especially in the Key Deer zone on and around Big Pine Key. There, the speed is 35 at night and 45 during the day.</p>
