<h2 id=does-china-and-korea-have-the-same-culture>Does China and Korea have the same culture?</h2>
<p>Although they are both of Asian origin and their countries are part of the Asian continent, the two cultures are different due to their language, traditions, history and attitude to life in general. The Chinese and the Koreans are members of the largest and most populated continents in the world.</p>
<h2 id=do-japan-and-china-have-similar-cultures>Do Japan and China have similar cultures?</h2>
<p>Most people think that China and Japan share a lot of cultural similarities, but they are actually two very different cultures. The two nations have as much in common as they have differences. China has multiple spoken dialects including Mandarin, Wu and Cantonese, while in Japan they only have one dialect.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-cultural-ideas-shared-by-japan-and-china>What are some of the cultural ideas shared by Japan and China?</h2>
<p>China, the much older state and the more developed, passed on to Japan (sometimes indirectly via Korea) a long list of ideas including rice cultivation, writing, Buddhism, centralised government models, civil service examinations, temple architecture, clothing, art, literature, music, and eating habits.</p>
<h2 id=is-bts-korean-or-chinese>Is BTS Korean or Chinese?</h2>
<p>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-korea-and-china-influence-japanese-culture>How did Korea and China influence Japanese culture?</h2>
<p>The other areas to greatly impact Japan were the kingdoms of Korea, which was the closest culture to Japan and therefore the main point of contact between Japan and mainland Asia. Through Korea, the major Asian religion Buddhism travelled from China to Japan and became a major influence on Japanese culture.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-korea-become-a-part-of-japan>When did Korea become a part of Japan?</h2>
<p>If it was before 1840, Korea was a brother of China and Japan called China upper nations as the written part of Japanese as a language was borrowed from Chinese characters along with other products from Silk Road, including buddhism and sutras. After 1840 and before 1945, Korea was occupied by Japan and a large part of China.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-korea-have-to-do-with-china>What did Korea have to do with China?</h2>
<p>For most of history, the Korean Peninsula was divided into three major kingdoms. These kingdoms, called Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, each had ports on the Korean Peninsula and were critical in spreading Chinese ideas into Japan.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-buddhism-spread-from-china-to-korea>How did Buddhism spread from China to Korea?</h2>
<p>Buddhism was a religion from India that became very influential in China, where it was mixed with Chinese philosophies. From there, Buddhism spread into Korea, and from the Baekje Kingdom of Korea into Japan in the 6th century.</p>
