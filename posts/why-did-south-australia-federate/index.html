<h2 id=why-did-south-australia-federate>Why did South Australia federate?</h2>
<p>The issue of trade came to a head as people wanted the freedom to trade between the colonies without paying intercolonial tariffs. South Australians had their first opportunity to decide whether their colony would federate in 1898. Voting was not compulsory and many people did not vote in the referendum.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-reasons-for-federation-in-australia>What were the reasons for federation in Australia?</h2>
<p>Reasons for federation</p>
<ul>
<li>Free trade. While tariffs provided the colonial governments with much revenue , they restricted trade and movement between the colonies.</li>
<li>Defence.</li>
<li>Immigration.</li>
<li>National pride.</li>
<li>1891 federation convention.</li>
<li>The people’s conventions.</li>
<li>1897–98 federation convention.</li>
<li>First referendum: 1898.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-happened-when-australia-became-a-federation>What happened when Australia became a federation?</h2>
<p>Australia became a nation on 1 January 1901, when the British Parliament passed legislation enabling the six Australian colonies to collectively govern in their own right as the Commonwealth of Australia. It was a remarkable political accomplishment that had taken many years and several referenda to achieve.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-federation-have-on-australia>What impact did Federation have on Australia?</h2>
<p>The federation conventions. Convinced the colonies would be stronger if they united, Sir Henry Parkes gave a rousing address at Tenterfield, New South Wales in 1889 calling for ‘a great national government for all Australians’. Parkes’s call provided the momentum that led to Australia becoming a nation.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-federation-of-australia-change-australia>How did the Federation of Australia change Australia?</h2>
<p>– Answers How was Australia changed by federation? The federation of Australia in 1901 was significant because of the changes it led to in both positive and negative ways to Australia. Border taxes were part of the Australian life before federation.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-process-of-federation-stalled-in-australia>Why was the process of Federation stalled in Australia?</h2>
<p>However, the process of Federation was stalled by the economic depression of the 1890s, with its high levels of unemployment and strikes. The NSW town of Corowa held a Federation League Rally in 1893 where it was proposed that the Australian people themselves would vote for Federation.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-president-of-the-federation-of-australia>Who was the first president of the Federation of Australia?</h2>
<p>Federation 1901: Inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia Opening of the First Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia by HRH The Duke of Cornwall and York (Later HM King George V), May 9, 1901 by Tom Roberts</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-constitution-important-to-the-federation-of-australia>Why was the Constitution important to the Federation of Australia?</h2>
<p>It provides the political and legal framework for the nation which underpins many aspects of daily life. he Constitution also established the office of the Governor-General as the Queen’s representative in Australia. Edmund Barton was working on a draft of the Constitution in 1891. Why do you think it was another 10 years before Federation?</p>
