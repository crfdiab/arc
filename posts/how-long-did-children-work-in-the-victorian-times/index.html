<h2 id=how-long-did-children-work-in-the-victorian-times>How long did children work in the Victorian times?</h2>
<p>Many children worked 16 hour days under atrocious conditions, as their elders did. Ineffective parliamentary acts to regulate the work of workhouse children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day had been passed as early as 1802 and 1819.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-child-laborers-work-for>How long did child laborers work for?</h2>
<p>Forms of extreme child labor existed throughout American history until the 1930s. In particular, child labor was rife during the American Industrial Revolution (1820-1870). Industrialization attracted workers and their families from farms and rural areas into urban areas and factory work.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-children-have-to-work-in-victorian-times>Why did children have to work in Victorian times?</h2>
<p>Since a large part of the poor children had to work public jobs to help support their families many parents thought of children as income, and having more children who worked raised the income of the home. Many parents had 10 or 12 or even more children for this reason alone. How old did children have to be to work in Victorian Times?</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-the-average-child-in-the-victorian-age>How old was the average child in the Victorian age?</h2>
<p>As unbelievable as it sounds, sometimes even 4 or 5 years old. Actually this was not unique only to the Victorian age, children had been expected to work for centuries before this. They worked very hard and for long hours every day. On the job safety was not a major concern and they were expected to work in filthy conditions many times.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-a-nanny-in-the-victorian-era>What was the role of a nanny in the Victorian era?</h2>
<p>Victorian nannies were typically older women who never had children, and they did not have a reputation for being in any way warm. Instead, they were tough and crotchety and the opposite of what you’d put on a job advertisement for a nanny today. Rich Victorian parents often only communicated with their children once each day.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-poor-children-do-in-victorian-london>What did poor children do in Victorian London?</h2>
<p>Poor children often made their own toys such as rag balls or, if they were lucky, bought cheap penny toys. Wealthier children played with dolls with wax or china faces, toy soldiers and train sets. The Museum of London has a collection of tinplate toys that would have been bought from street traders for a penny.</p>
