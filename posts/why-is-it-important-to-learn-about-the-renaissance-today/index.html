<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-learn-about-the-renaissance-today>Why is it important to learn about the Renaissance today?</h2>
<p>The Renaissance teaches us the power of looking to the past for insights and inspiration in dealing with today’s issues. By looking to the past for guidance today, not only can we find potential sources of answers, but also ways to address current challenges that previous societies have faced.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-impact-of-the-renaissance>What is the impact of the Renaissance?</h2>
<p>Some of the greatest thinkers, authors, statesmen, scientists and artists in human history thrived during this era, while global exploration opened up new lands and cultures to European commerce. The Renaissance is credited with bridging the gap between the Middle Ages and modern-day civilization.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-long-lasting-effect-of-the-renaissance>What is the long lasting effect of the Renaissance?</h2>
<p>Long term effects The Renaissance paved the way for modern history so naturally there were many effects of this time period. One was an increase of literacy thanks to the Gutenberg Printing Press. The printing press was an “education reform”, it caused many Europeans to increase themselves intellectually.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-renaissance-cause>What did the Renaissance cause?</h2>
<p>Historians have identified several causes for the emergence of the Renaissance following the Middle Ages, such as: increased interaction between different cultures, the rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman texts, the emergence of humanism, different artistic and technological innovations, and the impacts of conflict …</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-renaissance-so-important-to-society>Why was the Renaissance so important to society?</h2>
<p>The Renaissance began to turn society toward a more humanist view of the world and encouraged scientific research and inventions that contemporary society in 2014 still relies on. Before the Renaissance, artists and authors generally focused on religious topics only and wrote for the nobility and the clergy.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-renaissance-an-important-turning-point>Why was the Renaissance an important turning point?</h2>
<p>The most important turning point was the renaissance. Art took a huge turn before the 1500’s and even after. The Renaissance has assisted the world of art in breaking away from a classic structure and shaping it to what it is day. Prior to this cultural rebirth, artworks were mostly not made to scale.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-renaissance-art-change-the-world>How did the Renaissance art change the world?</h2>
<p>Renaissance art did not limit itself to simply looking pretty, however. Behind it was a new intellectual discipline: perspective was developed, light and shadow were studied, and the human anatomy was pored over – all in pursuit of a new realism and a desire to capture the beauty of the world as it really was.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-southern-renaissance-important-to-southern-literature>Why was the Southern Renaissance important to Southern literature?</h2>
<p>The Southern Renaissance is important because it saw a bunch of new southern writers and affected southern literature. People say that the Southern renaissance ended before WWII but it actually continued after WWII and was Affected by it.</p>
