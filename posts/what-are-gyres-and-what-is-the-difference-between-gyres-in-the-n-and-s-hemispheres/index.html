<h2 id=what-are-gyres-and-what-is-the-difference-between-gyres-in-the-n-and-s-hemispheres>What are gyres and what is the difference between gyres in the N and S hemispheres?</h2>
<p>In the Northern Hemisphere the gyres rotate to the right (clockwise), while in the Southern Hemisphere the gyres rotate to the left (counterclockwise). There are five major gyres in the oceans; the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian (Figure 9.1.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-eastern-boundary-currents-different-from-western-boundary-currents-quizlet>How are eastern boundary currents different from western boundary currents quizlet?</h2>
<p>What differs between western boundary currents and eastern boundary currents? Western boundary currents tend to be hot, fast, and deep. Eastern boundary currents are cold, slow, and shallow.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-boundary-currents>What are the different boundary currents?</h2>
<p>There are five major ocean-wide gyres—the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian Ocean gyres. Each is flanked by a strong and narrow “western boundary current,” and a weak and broad “eastern boundary current” (Ross, 1995).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-currents-and-gyres-in-the-northern-pacific-ocean>What are the major currents and gyres in the northern Pacific ocean?</h2>
<p>The gyre has a clockwise circular pattern and is formed by four prevailing ocean currents: the North Pacific Current to the north, the California Current to the east, the North Equatorial Current to the south, and the Kuroshio Current to the west.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-eastern-and-western-boundary-currents-different>How are eastern and western boundary currents different?</h2>
<p>To move the same volume of water through each side, western boundary currents are faster, deeper, and narrower than eastern boundary currents. In the same way, western boundary currents are not only faster, but also deeper than eastern boundary currents, as they move the same volume through a narrower space.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-not-a-characteristic-of-western-boundary-currents>What is not a characteristic of western boundary currents?</h2>
<p>What is not a characteristic of western boundary currents? Shallow, broad and slow-flowing. Warm, deep, narrow, and fast flowing (Gulf Stream). An undercurrent, typical of the continental rise, which flows along the western boundaries of ocean basins.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-western-boundary-currents-due-to>What are the western boundary currents due to?</h2>
<p>Sub-tropical western boundary currents are warm, deep, narrow, and fast-flowing currents that form on the west side of ocean basins due to western intensification. They carry warm water from the tropics poleward.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-similarities-and-differences-between-a-western-boundary-current-and-an-eastern-boundary-current>What are the similarities and differences between a western boundary current and an eastern boundary current?</h2>
<p>They fall into two categories: 1) western boundary currents, which are narrow, deep-reaching, and fast-flowing currents, not unlike jet streams, associated with current instability and eddy shedding; and 2) eastern boundary currents, which are shallow, cover a wider region, are of moderate strength, and are often …</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-western-boundary-current-of-the-ocean-gyre>Which is the western boundary current of the ocean gyre?</h2>
<p>The Gulf Stream is the western boundary current of the gyre. The gyre then becomes the North Atlantic Current, which flows across the North Atlantic to Europe. Still flowing in a circular pattern, the current flows south as far as the northwestern coast of Africa, where it is known as the Canary Current—the gyre’s eastern boundary current.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-eastern-and-western-boundary-currents>What makes the eastern and western boundary currents?</h2>
<p>Coastal upwelling often brings nutrient-rich water into eastern boundary current regions, making them productive areas of the ocean. Western boundary currents are warm, deep, narrow, and fast-flowing currents that form on the west side of ocean basins due to western intensification.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-currents-of-the-north-pacific-gyre>What are the main currents of the North Pacific Gyre?</h2>
<p>The main ocean currents involved with the North Pacific Gyre. Boundary currents are ocean currents with dynamics determined by the presence of a coastline, and fall into two distinct categories: western boundary currents and eastern boundary currents.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-western-intensification-occur-in-the-gyres>Where does western intensification occur in the gyres?</h2>
<p>Western intensification also occurs in the polar gyres, where the sign of the wind stress curl and the direction of the resulting currents are reversed.</p>
