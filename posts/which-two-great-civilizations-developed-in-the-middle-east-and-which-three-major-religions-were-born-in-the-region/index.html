<p>Three of the world’s major religions — the monotheist traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam — were all born in the Middle East and are all inextricably linked to one another. Christianity was born from within the Jewish tradition, and Islam developed from both Christianity and Judaism.</p>

<p>The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Persians, and Phoenicians all built great empires, each of which rose to glory in the Middle East. Abstracted from Akkadian Language by John Heise. Because they were constantly interacting through war and trade, the societies in the Middle East borrowed from each other.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-religions-of-the-middle-east>What are the three religions of the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Symbols of the three religions that originated in the Middle East: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. “The cradle of civilization.” Throughout the centuries, historians have used these powerful words to describe the Middle East. In the ancient Middle East, many great civilizations rose and fell.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-civilization-in-the-middle-east>What was the first civilization in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Many great civilizations arose from the first farming cultures of the Fertile Crescent. The Fertile Crescent is the region in which humans first began farming and herding around 8,000 B.C.E. This dramatic change from nomadic hunting and gathering allowed early humans to settle into permanent villages and to begin accumulating a surplus of food.</p>

<p>The first ancient societies arose in Mesopotamia and Egypt in the Middle East, in the Indus valley region of what are now Pakistan and India, in the Huang He (Yellow River) valley of China, on the island of Crete in the Aegean Sea, and in Central America.</p>
