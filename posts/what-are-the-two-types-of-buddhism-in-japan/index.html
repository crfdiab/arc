<h2 id=what-were-the-two-forms-of-buddhism-that-developed-in-japan-and-why-were-there-two-types>What were the two forms of Buddhism that developed in Japan and why were there two types?</h2>
<p>What were two forms of Buddhism developed in Japan? * The two forms of Buddhism developed in Japan are Pure Land Buddhism and Zen Buddhism.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-2-types-of-buddhism-today>What are the 2 types of Buddhism today?</h2>
<p>Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravāda (Pali: “The School of the Elders”) and Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: “The Great Vehicle”).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-japanese-adopt-different-forms-of-buddhism>Why did the Japanese adopt different forms of Buddhism?</h2>
<p>Why did the Japanese adopt different forms of Buddhism? To meet their own unique needs in different ways.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-pure-land-buddhism-popular>Why was Pure Land Buddhism popular?</h2>
<p>Pure Land Buddhism received a major boost to its popularity in the 12th century with the simplifications made by Honen. Pure Land Buddhism took off in Japan when the monk Honen (1133-1212) simplified the teachings and practices of the sect so that anyone could cope with them.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-buddhism-was-popular-in-japan-during-the-middle-ages>What type of Buddhism was popular in Japan during the Middle Ages?</h2>
<p>Zen Buddhism<br>
Samurai values of service to a lord and personal loyalty become central to Japanese cultural tradition over the centuries. Zen Buddhism spreads among the samurai, emphasizing personal enlightenment through discipline and meditation.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-popular-form-of-buddhism-in-japan>Which is the most popular form of Buddhism in Japan?</h2>
<p>Buddhism has had a major influence on the development of Japanese society and remains an influential aspect of the culture to this day. In modern times, Japan’s most popular schools of Buddhism are Pure Land Buddhism, Nichiren Buddhism, Shingon Buddhism and Zen.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-buddhism-and-shinto-related-in-japan>How are Buddhism and Shinto related in Japan?</h2>
<p>But after 1,500 years in the same culture, Buddhism and Shinto are woven together in a particularly Japanese way, and most Japanese have no problem observing both religions, albeit for different reasons: While weddings are usually performed under Shinto auspices, funerals are almost always a Buddhist affair, to the point …</p>
<h2 id=when-did-buddhism-become-firmly-established-in-japan>When did Buddhism become firmly established in Japan?</h2>
<p>While Zen was first introduced into Japan several centuries earlier, it did not become firmly established until the thirteenth century, when the warrior class began to favor this school of thought. In India several hundred years after the time of Shakyamuni, Buddhism developed a rich tradition of visual imagery for depicting sacred beings.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-religion-do-they-have-in-japan>What kind of religion do they have in Japan?</h2>
<p>Japan is home to not one, but two religions, Shinto and Buddhism. Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples often stand side by side, and the Japanese see no inconsistency worshiping the Buddha and the many Shinto kami with virtually the same breath.</p>
