<p>Hi and welcome to the forum. That’s a mighty trip. Count on 2800-3000 miles with detours so if you can manage an average speed of 60 mph its already 45-50 hours of travelling and 60 mph for an average is fast with the stops, trafficdelays etc etc. and you don’t want to damage your brand new car. It’s also a strenuous drive.</p>
