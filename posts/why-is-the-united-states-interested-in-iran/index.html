<h2 id=why-is-the-united-states-interested-in-iran>Why is the United States interested in Iran?</h2>
<p>While the United States remains connected to world markets, the country is far less dependent on foreign sources of oil than in the past. For natural gas U.S. marketed production now exceeds U.S. consumption. The United States has become an exporter of natural gas.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-iran-important-in-the-cold-war>Why was Iran important in the Cold War?</h2>
<p>It was during this time that Iran became increasingly important to U.S. foreign policy; not only did the Middle Eastern country share a border with the Soviet Union – America’s new Cold War enemy – but it was also the most powerful player in an oil-rich region.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-the-us-and-iran-after-world-war-2>What was the relationship between the US and Iran after World War 2?</h2>
<p>Relations between the U.S. and Iran were relatively smooth in the first few years after World War Two. In 1941, the UK and Soviet Union had forced the abdication of the Iranian monarch, Reza Shah Pahlavi (who they considered to be friendly towards the Axis powers), and replaced him with his eldest son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-united-states-meddling-in-iran>Why is the United States meddling in Iran?</h2>
<p>Today, the idea of “western meddling” in Iran is often used cynically by the country’s leaders to deflect attention from domestic problems and establish a common enemy around which Iranians can rally against. But it’s not an easy idea to counter given historical precedents.</p>

<h2 id=when-did-the-united-states-have-diplomatic-relations-with-iran>When did the United States have diplomatic relations with Iran?</h2>
<p>Iran and the United States have had no formal diplomatic relations since April 1980. Pakistan serves as Iran’s protecting power in the United States, while Switzerland serves as the United States’ protecting power in Iran.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-united-states-important-to-persia>Why was the United States important to Persia?</h2>
<p>Initially, while Persia was very wary of British and Russian colonial interests during the Great Game, the United States was seen as a more trustworthy foreign power, and the Americans Arthur Millspaugh and Morgan Shuster were even appointed treasurers-general by the Shahs of the time.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-united-states-need-to-stay-in-iraq>Why does the United States need to stay in Iraq?</h2>
<p>If the U.S. presence remains intact, the American, Iraqi, and global economy would share in those benefits. If the United States leaves, however, Iran would effectively gain increasing control of vast energy and financial resources, diverting them from Iraqi development in order to evade sanctions and greatly assist its own hegemonic ambitions.</p>
