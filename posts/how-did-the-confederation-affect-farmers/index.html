<h2 id=how-did-the-confederation-affect-farmers>How did the Confederation affect farmers?</h2>
<p>Farmers probably suffered the most from economic difficulties following the Revolution. The supply of farm produce exceeded demand, and unrest centered chiefly among farmer-debtors who wanted strong remedies to avoid foreclosure on their property and imprisonment for debt. Courts were clogged with suits for debt.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-farmers-feel-about-conscription>How did farmers feel about conscription?</h2>
<p>Farmers Need Workers, Oppose Conscription In the conscription debate of 1917, farmers pushed the Borden government to acknowledge their important wartime work by exempting their sons from conscription. Believing that Borden had betrayed them, farmers united in protest, but conscription continued.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-farmers-protest-against-the-government>Why do farmers protest against the government?</h2>
<p>Their demands: The key demand is the withdrawal of the three laws which deregulate the sale of their crops. The farmer unions could also settle for a legal assurance that the MSP system will continue, ideally through an amendment to the laws. Farmers say rules against stubble burning should also not apply to them.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-farmers-criticize>What did the farmers criticize?</h2>
<p>Many attributed their problems to discriminatory railroad rates, monopoly prices charged for farm machinery and fertilizer, an oppressively high tariff, an unfair tax structure, an inflexible banking system, political corruption, corporations that bought up huge tracks of land.</p>
<h2 id=what-if-we-kept-the-articles-of-confederation>What if we kept the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>There would be nobody to oversee the citizens’ actions. Additionally, our country would be severely unprotected. There would be nobody to appoint ambassadors and make treaties, in addition to the fact that there was no military under the Articles. Each state could put tariffs on trade between states.</p>
<h2 id=did-farmers-benefit-from-ww1>Did farmers benefit from ww1?</h2>
<p>In WWI the American farmers increased their production to almost entirely sustain the Allied effort. This increased production was important as it helped start the engine for the war and also led to the overproduction of the Roaring 20’s leading to the Great Depression.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-farmers-need-the-most>What do farmers need the most?</h2>
<p>They need many different types of resources. Farmers need natural resources, such as land, air, nutrients, water and sunlight. Farmers themselves need energy so they can work the land.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-farm-laws>What are 3 farm laws?</h2>
<p>The Indian Parliament passed three agriculture acts—Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance, Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020—during its monsoon session culminating on 23 …</p>
<h2 id=what-problems-did-farmers-face-in-the-progressive-era>What problems did farmers face in the Progressive Era?</h2>
<p>Several basic factors were involved-soil exhaustion, the vagaries of nature, overproduction of staple crops, decline in self-sufficiency, and lack of adequate legislative protection and aid.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-farm-laws>What are the three farm laws?</h2>
<h2 id=why-was-farming-important-to-the-fathers-of-confederation>Why was farming important to the fathers of Confederation?</h2>
<p>Farming, in Jeffersonian thought, served as the basis for a stable republic, and a similar agrarian dream underlay the thoughts of many of the Fathers of Confederation. The farm family reflected virtue and stability, in contrast to the dangers the city posed with its diseases, anonymity, and potential social unrest.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-promise-of-confederation-to-farmers>What was the promise of Confederation to farmers?</h2>
<p>After all, one way to conceive of Confederation was as a “back-to-the-land” movement, or perhaps more accurately, as a “make-farms” project. Brown saw the great promise of Confederation in opening up the west and north to economic activity, oblivious to any prior claims on that territory.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-federal-farmer-say-about-consolidation>What did the Federal Farmer say about consolidation?</h2>
<p>The Federal Farmer rejects these first two options in favor of a third, in which a partial consolidation takes place, or, as he puts it, “We may consolidate the states as to certain national objects, and leave them severally distinct independent republics, as to internal police generally.”</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-challenges-of-the-articles-of-confederation>What are the challenges of the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>Challenges of the Articles of Confederation 1 Key points. The Articles of Confederation comprised the United States’ first constitution, lasting from 1776 until 1789. 2 The US government under the Articles of Confederation. The American states evolved from separate colonies, with unique histories and societies. 3 Shays’s Rebellion. …</p>
