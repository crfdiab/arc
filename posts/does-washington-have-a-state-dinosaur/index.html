<h2 id=does-washington-have-a-state-dinosaur>Does Washington have a state dinosaur?</h2>
<p>Rep. Melanie Morgan is the prime sponsor of House Bill 1067, a move to name Suciasaurus the official dinosaur of the state of Washington. In 2012 scientists found a fossil of what was believed to be the first dinosaur discovered in the state in the San Juan Islands.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-no-dinosaurs-in-washington-state>Why are there no dinosaurs in Washington state?</h2>
<p>Why have no dinosaurs been found in Washington state until now? Dinosaurs are found in rocks from the time periods in which they lived (240-66 million years ago). Washington state was mostly underwater during this period, so Washington has very little exposed rock of the right age.</p>
<h2 id=did-george-washington-know-dinosaurs-exist>Did George Washington know dinosaurs exist?</h2>
<p>George Washington died in 1799, the first Dinosaur fossil was discovered in 1824. George Washington never knew Dinosaurs existed. MLK died in 1968, coronavirus was discovered in 2019.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-oldest-town-in-washington-state>Whats the oldest town in Washington state?</h2>
<p>Port Steilacoom<br>
The oldest incorporated town in Washington was founded in January of 1851 by Lafayette Balch, a Maine sea captain. He called his new town Port Steilacoom, after the Native Americans in the area and created the beginnings of Steilacoom’s economy.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-george-washington-think-of-dinosaurs>What did George Washington think of dinosaurs?</h2>
<p>George Washington died in 1799. So he never knew dinosaurs existed. Instead, he was more likely to have believed that there was an extinct race of giant humans. The same goes for Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and all those who lived before them.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-only-dinosaur-found-in-washington-state>Which is the only dinosaur found in Washington State?</h2>
<p>On the shore they came upon what was determined to be a fossilized chunk of a left thigh bone of a theropod dinosaur, the group of two-legged meat eaters whose best known member is Tyrannosaurus rex. This is the only dinosaur fossil ever discovered in the state.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-dinosaur-found-in-the-united-states>Where was the first dinosaur found in the United States?</h2>
<p>In 2015, scientists found the first — and only — dinosaur fossil in Washington state. It was the partial thigh bone of a theropod — a group that includes raptors, t-rex, and modern birds. Dinosaur fossils have been found in every state in the west, and Washington has plenty of mammoth, mastodon, and giant sloth bones.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-suciasaurus-rex-the-state-of-washington>Is the suciasaurus Rex the state of Washington?</h2>
<p>Thanks to the discovery of a 17-inch fossil and the desire of a class of Parkland fourth graders, Washington may soon have an official state dinosaur named Suciasaurus rex . Dino-lovers, try to say that one time fast.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-dinosaur-fossils-in-the-west>Are there any dinosaur fossils in the west?</h2>
<p>Dinosaur fossils have been found in every state in the west, and Washington has plenty of mammoth, mastodon, and giant sloth bones. Why is evidence of dinosaurs so rare here? Turns out, the answer has a lot to do with an epic geologic journey.</p>
