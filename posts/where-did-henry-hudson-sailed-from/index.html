<p>Holland<br>
Hudson departed from Holland on the ship Halve Maen (Half Moon) in April 1609, but when adverse conditions again blocked his route northeast, he ignored his agreement with his employers to return directly and decided to sail to the New World in search of the so-called “northwest passage.”</p>

<p>city of London<br>
Where did Henry Hudson grow up? Historians know very little of Henry Hudson’s youth. He was probably born in or near the city of London sometime between 1560 and 1570. It is likely that his family was wealthy and that his grandfather founded a trading company called the Muscovy Company.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-henry-hudsons-family>What was the name of Henry Hudson’s family?</h2>
<p>He had a wife, Katherine, and three sons, Oliver, John and Richard. Together they lived in London’s St. Katherine district. Henry Hudson (with his son John) made his first known voyage in 1607 in the Hopewell, with a crew of 12. The voyage was associated with Sir Thomas Smythe, a leading figure in the East India Company.</p>

<p>Henry Hudson made his first voyage west from England in 1607, when he was hired to find a shorter route to Asia from Europe through the Arctic Ocean. After twice being turned back by ice, Hudson embarked on a third voyage–this time on behalf of the Dutch East India Company–in 1609.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-henry-hudson-discover-the-hudson-river>How did Henry Hudson discover the Hudson River?</h2>
<p>Introduction Henry Hudson made four voyages in search of a water route to the Far East. His first two voyages were through Arctic waters and proved to be unsuccessful due to ice. His third and fourth voyages were to North America where he discovered and sailed the Hudson River, Hudson Strait, and Hudson Bay.</p>

<p>Hudson’s discovery of a route to the continent’s interior proved of inestimable value to England, woodcut (courtesy Library and Archives Canada/C-17727). Little is known about Henry Hudson’s origins.</p>
