<p>After the Pope denied King Henry’s request for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon (the vatican didn’t want to anger Spain), Henry and his parliament split from the Roman Catholic Church through the Act of Supremacy, which then placed Henry and all successors as head of the new Church of England.</p>

<p>3 November 1534<br>
On 3 November 1534 King Henry VIII became the Head of the newly founded Church of England. At the time this was a seismic shift in the power dynamics of Europe, as England’s split from Rome was confirmed.</p>

<p>the Act of Supremacy<br>
Parliament’s passage of the Act of Supremacy in 1534 solidified the break from the Catholic Church and made the king the Supreme Head of the Church of England.</p>

<p>Henry and the monarchs that followed took on the role of “defender of the faith.” Since then, monarchs have pledged to uphold the religious tenets of the Church of England at their coronations. Within the royal family, it became nearly impossible to divorce or marry someone whose previous marriage had ended.</p>

<p>In the 1530s, Henry decided he wanted an annulment after Catherine of Aragon failed to give birth to a male heir. When the pope repeatedly refused to grant his request, Henry first limited the Church’s influence in England, then formally severed ties to Catholicism in 1534.</p>

<p>Finally, he demanded that the Church in England recognize the king as its head and protector. This was done formally on February 11, 1531. While this act may be thought to have been the last straw in the deteriorating relationship between Henry and Rome, this was not the case.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-england-and-head-of-the-church>Who was the King of England and head of the church?</h2>
<p>Henry VIII: King of England & Head of Church. In 1534 the Act of Supremacy declared Henry himself to be Supreme Head of the Church of England, and anyone who denied this title was guilty of an act of treason. Some changes were also made in the church services, the Bible was translated into English, and printed copies were placed in the churches.</p>

<p>King Henry VIII Named Head Of English Church, February 11, 1531. Today in 1531, The Catholic Church in England recognized King Henry VIII as its supreme head.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-supreme-head-of-the-church-of-ireland>Who was the Supreme Head of the Church of Ireland?</h2>
<p>This Act established Henry VIII as the supreme head of the Church of Ireland. Henry had fully abandoned Rome. However, when his daughter by Catherine of Aragon became Queen Mary I in 1553, she attempted to reestablish the English church’s allegiance to the Pope and had the Act of Supremacy repealed by Parliament in 1555.</p>
