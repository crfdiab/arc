<h2 id=what-happens-to-clothes-when-they-are-recycled>What happens to clothes when they are recycled?</h2>
<p>After collection, textiles are taken to a recycling centre, such as LMBarry in East London. Clothes are classified into three groups: reuse, rags and fiber. This process is generally done by hand. Clothes that can be reused could be sent to charity shops or to markets abroad for resale.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-bad-to-recycle-clothes>Is it bad to recycle clothes?</h2>
<p>It Conserves Vital Energy Every piece of clothing you’re wearing has gone through a complex manufacturing process that uses a high amount of electricity, water, and other energy sources. Recycling clothes saves energy by reducing or eliminating the need to make materials from scratch.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-put-fabric-in-the-recycling-bin>Can you put fabric in the recycling bin?</h2>
<p>According to Recycle Nation, nearly every kind of fabric can be recycled. This is considered recycling because you’re giving the clothes a new chance at life with a new owner, rather than throwing them away as trash. However, if you have tattered clothes or fabric scraps, you probably don’t want to donate them.</p>

<h2 id=what-does-goodwill-do-with-stuff-they-dont-sell>What does Goodwill do with stuff they don’t sell?</h2>
<p>For those items that just don’t sell, they are put into our salvage stream where they are either sold to textile and other recyclers. Plus, nationally, Goodwill has earned hundreds of millions of dollars by selling to salvage vendors – dollars that help people find jobs to our community.</p>
<h2 id=should-i-throw-out-all-my-clothes>Should I throw out all my clothes?</h2>
<p>It Hasn’t Fit in a Year And sometimes the size of the clothing itself changes as it stretches with wear and tear. However, even if something fit you perfectly at one point, it might not fit forever. So if you’ve hung on to ill-fitting clothing for more than a year, it’s time to get rid of it.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-your-clothes-when-you-dispose-of-them>What happens to your clothes when you dispose of them?</h2>
<p>“When we dispose our clothes, they either end up in landfills or are sold again. However, now there are many recycling mills where second-hand clothing and fabrics from all over the world are segregated, torn apart to remove buttons, zippers and labels, and then treated to be re-purposed and used as yarn.</p>

<h2 id=where-do-i-go-to-recycle-my-clothes>Where do I go to recycle my clothes?</h2>
<p>Clothes are collected from TRAID textile banks across the UK and through its convenient free home collection service.</p>

<p>But for the charity sector, selling on the clothing that can’t be sold in shops remains a key source of income. “The important thing is that charities maximise every donation, no matter what quality it [donated clothing] is, to help fund their life-changing charity work,” a spokesman for the Charity Retail Association says.</p>
