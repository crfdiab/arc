<h2 id=did-socks-exist-in-ancient-china>Did socks exist in ancient China?</h2>
<p>By the year 960 when the Song Dynasty began, Chinese people wore socks more frequently. Ordinary people wore socks made of cotton while rich people’s socks were generally made of silk. Some women with bound feet in the Song Dynasty wrapped their feet with a long piece of cotton fabric to replace socks.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-invented-socks>What country invented socks?</h2>
<p>Ancient Greece<br>
Ancient Greece Socks first came into existence in the 8th century BC. According to Internet Archive, they were made out of matted animal hair and actually called piloi. Making socks from animals was a common theme back then.</p>
<h2 id=are-socks-made-in-china>Are socks made in China?</h2>
<p>23 (Xinhua) — As the world’s largest sock manufacturing base, Datang in the city of Zhuji, east China’s Zhejiang Province, produces about 70 percent of China’s socks and 30 percent worldwide.</p>
<h2 id=do-chinese-people-not-wear-socks>Do Chinese people not wear socks?</h2>
<p>In China, they see it as being very unhygienic to wear shoes indoors and in some cases, you will even be given house shoes or slippers to wear by your host. In most cases, you’ll be in socks or bare feet. You’ll notice in many houses shoes, slippers, flip flops etc in a large pile near the front door!</p>
<h2 id=why-do-socks-exist>Why do socks exist?</h2>
<p>Why are socks important? Not only do socks absorb moisture, but they are also used to help prevent rubbing of shoes on the bare foot. Socks can also provide cushioning to pad the feet and help keep them warm. As we are going into the fall and winter months, socks can help prevent cold feet and even frostbite.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-sock>What was the first sock?</h2>
<p>But the first socks were actually made from leather or matted animal hair – called “piloi” in 8th century BC Greece. A thousand years later in the 2nd century AD, the Romans were the first ones to sew woven fabrics together and make fitted socks (“udones”).</p>
<h2 id=which-country-makes-the-best-socks>Which country makes the best socks?</h2>
<p>Turkey has crossed Italy in socks exports and rose to second place after China. The country is the second largest exporter of socks, accounting for 10% of world socks imports in 2016, following China, the world’s largest socks maker, which meets 40% of the world socks exports alone, according to Ozkan Karaca.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-most-socks-manufactured>Where are most socks manufactured?</h2>
<p>China<br>
Socks, like most clothing, are created across the globe. One of the most prolific cities in the sock-manufacture business is the Datang district of Zhuji, China. The area makes so many socks that it is often referred to as Sock City.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-chinese-always-wash-their-feet>Why do Chinese always wash their feet?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, washing feet is done for three reasons: to clean dirty feet every day before going to bed (clean feet in bed is one of the most important things for Chinese at home); to improve health (the Chinese believe in massaging the feet during the washing, sometimes adding herbs to the hot water); and to help sex …</p>
<h2 id=why-do-japanese-wear-slippers-in-the-house>Why do Japanese wear slippers in the house?</h2>
<p>Nearly all Japanese homes today have one or more Western-style rooms with wooden flooring or carpets. To prevent their socks from getting dirty and their feet from getting cold, most Japanese change into slippers after taking off their shoes.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-best-sock-manufacturers-in-china>Who are the best sock manufacturers in China?</h2>
<p>Zhuji City Qingyuan Knitting & Textile Co., Ltd. is a professional socks manufacturer which was verified by BV and SGS in China. We have more than 15 years experience in the socks …</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-pair-of-socks-made>Where was the first pair of socks made?</h2>
<p>Roman tablets found at the site even include the instruction to “send more socks”. Also around that time, the first knit socks were being made in Ancient Egypt. The earliest known surviving pair of knitted socks, made with a technique called naalbinding, dates from 300 – 500 AD and was found at Oxyrhynchus on the Nile in Egypt.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-worlds-largest-sock-production-take-place>Where does the world’s largest sock production take place?</h2>
<p>The township-level district of Datang in the city of Zhuji in Zhejiang Province, People’s Republic of China, has become known as Sock City. The town currently produces 8 billion pairs of socks each year, a third of the world’s sock production, effectively creating two pairs of socks for every person on the planet in 2011.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-socks-come-into-existence-in-the-industrial-revolution>How did socks come into existence in the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>Socks made for the lower classes used wool, while those made for noblemen were made of coloured silk. After the Industrial Revolution socks became easier and cheaper to produce, spreading their appeal across European society. Many of the principles William Lee developed can still be found in modern textile machinery today.</p>
