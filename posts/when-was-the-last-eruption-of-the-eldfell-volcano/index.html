<h2 id=when-was-the-last-eruption-of-the-eldfell-volcano>When was the last eruption of the Eldfell volcano?</h2>
<p>Last eruption. January to June 1973. Eldfell is a volcanic cone just over 200 metres (660 ft) high on the Icelandic island of Heimaey. It formed in a volcanic eruption, which began without warning on the eastern side of Heimaey, in the Westman Islands, on 23 January 1973. The name means Hill of Fire in Icelandic.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Eldfell is a volcanic cone just over 200 metres (660 ft) high on the Icelandic island of Heimaey. It formed in a volcanic eruption, which began without warning on the eastern side of Heimaey, in the Westman Islands, on 23 January 1973. The name means Hill of Fire in Icelandic.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-eldfell-volcano-in-the-westman-islands-steep>Is the Eldfell volcano in the Westman Islands steep?</h2>
<p>Eldfell Volcano in the Westman Islands. To gain a deeper insight, I hiked to the top of this maroon volcano. It is a bit steep, not too steep though, but I had to stop a couple of times to catch my breath and take in the beautiful view. Unfortunately, it was foggy during my visit, but still, I had a beautiful view of the Westman Islands.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-lava-on-top-of-mt-eldfell-still-hot>Is the lava on top of Mt Eldfell still hot?</h2>
<p>The lava is so bright and takes on so many hues of the red colour that I was in awe. The lava on top of Mt. Eldfell is still hot in places and steam was coming from underneath. Just imagine how hot this volcano still is, 46 years after the eruption!</p>

<h2 id=how-many-people-died-on-the-island-of-eldfell>How many people died on the island of Eldfell?</h2>
<p>Within six hours of the onset of the eruption, almost all of the 5,300 people of the island were safely on the mainland. A few people remained to carry out essential functions and to salvage belongings from threatened houses. Cattle, horses and sheep on the island were slaughtered.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-islanders-do-after-the-eldfell-eruption>What did the islanders do after the Eldfell eruption?</h2>
<p>An operation was mounted to cool the advancing lava flow by pumping sea water onto it, which was successful in preventing the loss of the harbour. After the eruption, the islanders used heat from the cooling lava flows to provide hot water and to generate electricity.</p>
