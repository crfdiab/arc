<h2 id=how-much-did-the-leaning-tower-of-pisa-cost>How much did the Leaning Tower of Pisa cost?</h2>
<p>Cost of the day: The price of white marble is about $ 2.900. 000 dollars, and the cost of labor amounted to about $ 1,200,000, which means that the cost of building the Tower of Leaning Tower today is estimated at $ 4.100. 000 dollars.</p>
<h2 id=who-paid-for-the-leaning-tower-of-pisa>Who paid for the Leaning Tower of Pisa?</h2>
<p>The first name that comes up in the history of the Tower is Donna Berta di Bernardo, a local widow who donated sixty silver coins to the “Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie”. That money financed the purchase or part of the stones used for the foundation of the Tower.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-leaning-tower-of-pisa-make-money>How does the Leaning Tower of Pisa make money?</h2>
<p>While the Tower was built as a freestanding tower bell for the nearby Cathedral, today its purpose is very different. In fact, nowadays the bells are seldom used. Today the Leaning Tower of Pisa is used to make money! The construction of the Tower was finished in 1372.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-the-leaning-tower-of-pisa-lean-in-2020>How much does the Leaning Tower of Pisa lean in 2020?</h2>
<p>Now back to the physics: In terms of angles, the tower now leans at 3.99 degrees. Considering the weight and height of the tower, physicists have said the maximum angle would be 5.44 degrees before the tower falls (at its worst, the tower once leaned briefly at 5.5 degrees.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-leaning-tower-of-pisa-a-bell-tower>Is the Leaning Tower of Pisa a bell tower?</h2>
<p>Not many people know the Leaning Tower of Pisa is actually a bell tower, and that many other sites within the city are sinking. After all, Pisa is a sea-port town built on swampy soils. Over the years, the tower has undergone intense (and pricy) restoration.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-soil-does-the-leaning-tower-of-pisa-use>What kind of soil does the Leaning Tower of Pisa use?</h2>
<p>Horizon-B consists of marine clay and sandy soil. Sandy soil is sandwiched between the layers of clayey soil. The upper clay layer is very sensitive, whereas the lower clay layer is stiff and less sensitive. The thickness of horizon-B is 40 m.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-buy-tickets-for-the-tower-of-pisa>Where can I buy tickets for the Tower of Pisa?</h2>
<p>It’s possible to buy tickets onsite. But because there’s such a long line, it won’t guarantee you access. To be sure you can visit the tower (and skip the queue), buy your tickets online. You can book up to 20 days in advance, using the Tower of Pisa’s official website.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-a-tower-leaning-on-the-wall>Why is a tower leaning on the wall?</h2>
<p>The first step was to investigate how the tower had been built originally, to understand why it was leaning. The team discovered that the tower had probably begun to lean from day one. “You can see tapered layers of masonry, showing that the builders were trying to correct the slant even as they were building it,” says John.</p>
