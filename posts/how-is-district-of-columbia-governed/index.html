<h2 id=how-is-district-of-columbia-governed>How is District of Columbia governed?</h2>
<p>The District of Columbia Government consists of three branches of government: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. Although local officials have the authority to pass laws and govern local affairs, the United States Congress maintains the power to overturn local laws.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-district-of-columbia-and-why>What is the District of Columbia and why?</h2>
<p>Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. The new federal territory was named District of Columbia to honour explorer Christopher Columbus, and the new federal city was named for George Washington.</p>
<h2 id=what-exactly-is-the-district-of-columbia>What exactly is the District of Columbia?</h2>
<p>Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. This makes it the political center of the United States of America. Washington was named after the first U.S. President George Washington. “D.C.” stands for “District of Columbia”.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-district-of-columbia>What was the purpose of District of Columbia?</h2>
<p>Congress established the federal district in 1790 to serve as the nation’s capital, from land belonging to the states of Maryland and Virginia. The Constitution dictates that the federal district be under the jurisdiction of the US Congress.</p>

<h2 id=when-did-the-district-of-columbia-become-a-state>When did the District of Columbia become a state?</h2>
<p>The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 created a single new district corporation governing the entire federal territory, called the District of Columbia, thus dissolving the three major political subdivisions of the District (Port of Georgetown, the City of Washington, and Washington County) and their governments.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-powers-of-the-district-of-columbia>What are the powers of the District of Columbia?</h2>
<p>Congress, through the Home Rule Act, dictated the legislative powers to the district council and the executive powers to the mayor. Advisory neighborhood commissions, which are groups elected by the residents, advise the council on matters of public policy.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-us-representative-for-the-district-of-columbia>Who is the US Representative for the District of Columbia?</h2>
<p>The United States Congress has ultimate authority over the District. The District is not a U.S. state and therefore has no voting representation in the Congress. D.C. residents elect a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives, currently Eleanor Holmes Norton (D- D.C.</p>
