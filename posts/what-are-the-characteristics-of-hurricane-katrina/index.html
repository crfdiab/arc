<p>Category 5 storms have sustained winds in excess of 156 mph. Katrina’s hurricane-force winds of 160 mph extended 90 miles from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds stretched 200 miles in each direction from its center. Hurricanes are typically no more than 300 miles wide.</p>

Hurricane Katrina</p>

<h2 id=what-made-hurricane-katrina-a-category-5>What made Hurricane Katrina a Category 5?</h2>
<p>Katrina Stalled over the Gulf of Mexico, gaining strength. But over the Gulf of Mexico, some 165 miles west of Key West, the storm gathered strength above the warmer waters of the gulf. On August 28, the storm was upgraded to a category 5 hurricane, with steady winds of 160 mph.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-prepare-for-cyclone-nargis>How did people prepare for cyclone Nargis?</h2>
<p>The villagers, community leaders and government personnel stressed the importance of construction of cyclone shelter and disaster resistance building, presence of life jacket, drinking water and food as preparedness for Cyclone.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-hurricane-and-a-tropical-cyclone>What is the difference between a hurricane and a tropical cyclone?</h2>
<p>Hurricane is a severe tropical cyclone originating in the equatorial regions of the Atlantic Ocean or Caribbean Sea or eastern regions of the Pacific Ocean, traveling north, northwest, or northeast from its point of origin. Cyclone has three types: tropical, subtropical and extratropical. Hurricane is a tropical cyclone.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-strength-of-a-tropical-cyclone>What is the strength of a tropical cyclone?</h2>
<p>STRENGTH: A storm gets a name and is considered a tropical storm at 39 mph (63 kph). It becomes a hurricane, typhoon, tropical cyclone, or cyclone at 74 mph (119 kph). There are five strength categories, depending on wind speed.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-hurricanes-and-cyclones-classified-on-the-saffir-simpson-scale>How are hurricanes and cyclones classified on the Saffir Simpson scale?</h2>
<p>Both cyclones and hurricanes turn clockwise in the Southern hemisphere and anticlockwise in the northern hemisphere. Hurricanes are classified into five categories according to the Saffir-Simpson scale. The wind speed and intensity of damage increases as from Category 1 to category 5.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-eye-of-a-hurricane-look-like>How does the eye of a hurricane look like?</h2>
<p>The signature bands of clouds, spiraling out from the storm center, can spread as far as 100 miles or more in major hurricanes. The eye of the hurricane sits in the middle of the storm system and is normally very clear and calm, with no cloud cover or any significant air movement.</p>
