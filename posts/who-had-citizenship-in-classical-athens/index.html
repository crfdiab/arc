<h2 id=who-had-citizenship-in-classical-athens>Who had citizenship in classical Athens?</h2>
<p>Greek democracy created at Athens was direct, rather than representative: any adult male citizen over the age of 20 could take part, and it was a duty to do so.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-citizen-of-athens>Who was the first citizen of Athens?</h2>
<p>Pericles<br>
Pericles was prominent and influential in Athenian politics, particularly between the Greco-Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian War, and was acclaimed by Thucydides, a contemporary historian, as “the first citizen of Athens”.</p>
<h2 id=was-everyone-a-citizen-in-athens>Was everyone a citizen in Athens?</h2>
<p>Not everyone in Athens was considered a citizen. Only free, adult men enjoyed the rights and responsibility of citizenship. Only about 20 percent of the population of Athens were citizens. Women were not citizens and therefore could not vote or have any say in the political process.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-citizens-in-athens>What was the role of citizens in Athens?</h2>
<p>Citizens were free men who were born in Athens and had an Athenian-born mother and an Athenian-born father. Only men could be citizens. Citizens were expected to serve in government positions, to vote and to perform military service. Citizens could send their sons to school and own property.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-athens-beliefs>What were Athens beliefs?</h2>
<p>Athens did not have a king, it was ruled by the people as a democracy. The people of Athens believed that no one group of people should make the laws and so citizens could choose the government officials, and vote for or against new laws. The people of Athens chose their ruler.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-slaves-do-in-athens>What did slaves do in Athens?</h2>
<p>The principal use of slaves was in agriculture, but they were also used in stone quarries or mines, and as domestic servants. Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 5th and 6th centuries BC, with an average of three or four slaves per household, except in poor families.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-you-become-a-citizen-of-athens>How did you become a citizen of Athens?</h2>
<p>To be classed as a citizen in fifth-century Athens you had to be male, born from two Athenian parents, over eighteen years old, and complete your military service. Women, slaves, metics and children under the age of 20 were not allowed to become citizens.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-considered-a-citizen-in-ancient-athens>Who was considered a citizen in ancient Athens?</h2>
<p>The Athenian definition of “ citizens ” was also different from modern-day citizens: only free men were considered citizens in Athens. Women, children, and slaves were not considered citizens and therefore could not vote.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-become-a-citizen-of-greece>How do you become a citizen of Greece?</h2>
<p>Greek citizenship may be acquired by descent or through naturalization. Greek law permits dual citizenship. A Greek national is a citizen of the European Union, and therefore entitled to the same rights as other EU citizens. How does Aristotle define citizenship?</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-greek-citizen-of-the-eu>What makes a Greek citizen of the EU?</h2>
<p>A Greek national is a citizen of the European Union, and therefore entitled to the same rights as other EU citizens. How does Aristotle define citizenship? Strictly speaking, according to Aristotle, a citizen is a person who possesses the virtues of ruling and being ruled (or being ruled but not ruling).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-marriage-become-legal-in-ancient-athens>How did marriage become legal in ancient Athens?</h2>
<p>For a marriage to be viewed as legitimate in Athens, both the bride and groom had to be of free status, and after 451BCE, both had to be legitimate children of Athenian citizen families. Children of such unions would then be considered legitimate Athenian citizens when they came of age.</p>
