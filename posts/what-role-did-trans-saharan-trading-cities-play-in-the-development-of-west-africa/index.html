<p>Finally, the trans-Saharan trade brought the Sudanic states and their access to gold to the attention of the world outside the insular West African region. Trade Commodities. Salt, gold, and slaves were the essential commodities throughout the 500-1590 period. Cloth also became an important trade good.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-west-african-nations-trade-on-the-tran-saharan-trade-route>What did the West African nations trade on the Tran Saharan trade route?</h2>
<p>Gold, sought from the western and central Sudan, was the main commodity of the trans-Saharan trade. The traffic in gold was spurred by the demand for and supply of coinage. The rise of the Soninke empire of Ghana appears to be related to the beginnings of the trans-Saharan gold trade in the fifth century.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-guns-affect-africa>How did guns affect Africa?</h2>
<p>African rulers exchanged captives for guns. Rulers were in competition with each other, so the acquisition of guns provided an edge over their rivals. This increased their drive to capture and sell slaves. The new availability of guns was a direct consequence of the slave trade.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-trans-saharan-trade-important-in-the-16th-century>Why was trans-Saharan trade important in the 16th century?</h2>
<p>Decline of trans-Saharan trade. The Portuguese journeys around the West African coast opened up new avenues for trade between Europe and West Africa. By the early 16th century, European trading bases, the factories established on the coast since 1445, and trade with the wealthier Europeans became of prime importance to West Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-trade-route-of-the-trans-saharan-caravans>What was the trade route of the Trans Saharan caravans?</h2>
<p>For starters, the trans-Saharan caravan trade was so dynamic and active that some historians refer to it as a sandy sea. In other words, just like the Pacific and the Atlantic have trade routes with bustling ports, so did the Sahara. However, rather than water and ships, the trans-Saharan trade routes had sand and camels.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spread-of-islam-affect-west-africa>How did the spread of Islam affect West Africa?</h2>
<p>Trade between West Africa and the Mediterranean predated Islam, however, North African Muslims intensified the Trans-Saharan trade. North African traders were major actors in introducing Islam into West Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-trade-route-between-africa-and-africa>What was the trade route between Africa and Africa?</h2>
<p>This was the shortest of the routes, and the primary exchanges were slaves and ivory from the south for salt. The western routes were the Walata Road, from the Sénégal River, and the Taghaza Trail, from the Niger River, which had their northern termini at the great trading center of Sijilmasa, situated in Morocco just north of the desert.</p>
