<h2 id=can-humans-land-on-mercury>Can humans land on Mercury?</h2>
<p>Have astronauts from Earth ever stepped foot on Mercury? No, Mercury has been visited by spacecraft from Earth, but no human has ever gone into orbit around Mercury, let alone stepped on the surface. During the daytime, the surface of Mercury at the equator rises to 700 Kelvin (427 degrees C).</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-you-landed-on-mercury>What would happen if you landed on Mercury?</h2>
<p>Mercury has a surface temperature of 800 degrees F (425 C). You’d die pretty much instantaneously. With a space suit, death would be within a couple of seconds. NASA spacesuits have a maximum temperature of 250F.</p>
<h2 id=how-would-a-human-live-on-mercury>How would a human live on Mercury?</h2>
<p>Mercury is not a planet that would be easy to survive on but it may not be impossible. It is worth noting that without a space suit you would not survive very long at all, due to a lack of atmosphere. On top of this Mercury has one of the largest changes in temperature in the Solar System.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-would-you-survive-on-mercury>How long would you survive on Mercury?</h2>
<p>Mercury rotates relatively slowly, so in order to survive, all you need is just catch the moment when the daytime temperature changes to the nighttime temperature, something comfortable between 800ºF and −290ºF. But anyhow 90 seconds is about how much time you could spend there.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-you-need-to-live-on-mercury>What would you need to live on Mercury?</h2>
<p>In order for life (as we know it) to exist, Mercury would need to have temperatures that allow liquid water to remain on its surface for long periods of time. But the temperatures on Mercury extend from just above absolute zero when the surface is shadowed to 700 Kelvin when its in sunlight. Liquid water just can’t exist in that kind of environment.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-any-life-on-the-planet-mercury>Is there any life on the planet Mercury?</h2>
<p>Life on Mercury. Any one of those impacts could have destroyed any life on the planet. Many scientists believe that a great deal of the planet’s surface was stripped away by one impact. If the impact removed a large portion of the surface, surely it would have taken any life that existed at the time with it.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-for-humans-to-colonize-mercury>Is it possible for humans to colonize Mercury?</h2>
<p>With its extreme temperature fluctuations, Mercury is not likely a planet that humans would ever want to colonize. But if we had the technology to survive on the planet closest to the sun, what …</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-atmosphere-is-there-on-mercury>What kind of atmosphere is there on Mercury?</h2>
<p>The atmosphere on Mercury is almost non-existant. It doesn’t protect the planet from the harsh radiation of the Sun or radiation from space, nor does it trap heat and provide a breathable atmosphere. Mercury is inhospitable and sterile.</p>
