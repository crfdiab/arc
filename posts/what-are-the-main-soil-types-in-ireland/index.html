<h2 id=what-are-the-main-soil-types-in-ireland>What are the main soil types in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Brown soils are the most common soil type in Ireland. Brown soils are rich and fertile. They are found mostly in the Midlands and the eastern counties. Another soil type found in Ireland is peaty soil.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-4-main-soil-types-in-ireland>What are the 4 main soil types in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Types of Soil</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sandy soils.</p>

<li>
<p>Clay soils.</p>

<h2 id=peat-soils-what-are-the-2-main-types-of-soil>Peat soils. What are the 2 main types of soil?</h2>
<p>Soil Types</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sandy soil. Sandy Soil is light, warm, dry and tend to be acidic and low in nutrients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clay Soil. Clay Soil is a heavy soil type that benefits from high nutrients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silt Soil. Silt Soil is a light and moisture retentive soil type with a high fertility rating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peat Soil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chalk Soil.</p>

<p>fertile brown earth<br>
In Ireland, the soil you are most likely to find is fertile brown earth – although it is very shallow. It is rich and fertile, hence 64% of the total land mass is used for agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=does-ireland-have-bad-soil>Does Ireland have bad soil?</h2>
<p>The general consensus is that Irish soil quality is good overall. Soil formation is very complex and differs on a range of factors. One of these is leaching (washing out) and it is prominent in Ireland since the water movement here is mainly downwards, which leaves the soil very acidic.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-common-soil-type-in-ireland>Which is the most common soil type in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Different plants grow in different soils. Brown soils are the most common soil type in Ireland. Brown soils are rich and fertile. They are found mostly in the Midlands and the eastern counties. Another soil type found in Ireland is peaty soil. You will spot it when you see a layer of turf or peat at the surface.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-you-find-brown-soil-in-ireland>Where do you find brown soil in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Brown soils are rich and fertile. They are found mostly in the Midlands and the eastern counties. Another soil type found in Ireland is peaty soil. You will spot it when you see a layer of turf or peat at the surface.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-authors-of-soils-of-ireland>Who are the authors of soils of Ireland?</h2>
<p>The Soils of Ireland provides a comprehensive overview of soil and soil studies in Ireland. It presents a complete set of data, pictures and maps, including benchmark profiles. Geological Survey Ireland scientists Mairéad Glennon, Ray Scanlon, Vincent Gallagher and Brian McConnell are co-authors on three sections of the book.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-irish-soil-information-system-important>Why is the Irish soil information system important?</h2>
<p>The publication of the Irish Soil Information System opens a new chapter in agricultural and environmental research. For the first time, after three generations of soil science, we have a complete picture of the diversity and properties of soils in Ireland. Figuratively speaking, this is equivalent to ‘sequencing Ireland’s soil genome’.</p>
