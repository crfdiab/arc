<h2 id=what-are-geographical-characteristics-of-the-colonies>What are geographical characteristics of the colonies?</h2>
<p>The Southern colonies were Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina and Georgia. These colonies had a wide coastal plain leading to rolling hills. Mountainous regions were in the western sections of the Southern colonies. The land was rich for farming, and the season was long because of the climate.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-some-of-the-geographical-features-of-new-england-middle-and-southern-colonies>What were some of the geographical features of New England middle and southern colonies?</h2>
<p>The geography consisted of forests and hills. Combined with the hard rocky land, cold climate and long winters, New England’s land was poor for large farming. Those who had small family owned farms were called Yeoman farmers. Colonists relied on fishing and whaling.</p>
<h2 id=what-geographic-features-helped-shape-the-colonial-economy-of-the-south>What geographic features helped shape the colonial economy of the south?</h2>
<p>Their climate is cold, they have wet/long winters, and hot summers with plenty of rain. The rivers and ports in the Middle Colonies allowed merchants to bring goods in and out of the area. This contributed to the region becoming a center of colonial trade.</p>
<h2 id=which-colony-had-the-best-geography>Which colony had the best geography?</h2>
<p>southern colonies<br>
The southern colonies had the best climate and land for farming. It was warm almost all year long.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-geography-of-the-southern-colonies>What was the geography of the southern colonies?</h2>
<p>The geography of the Southern Colonies featured tideland ideal for growing crops, hilly coastal plains, broad rivers for transportation, forests and swamp marshes. The tidelands extended from the Atlantic Ocean inland for about 100 miles. Beyond the tideland was the backcountry, which had less fertile soil and thicker forests.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-geography-like-in-colonial-virginia>What was the geography like in colonial Virginia?</h2>
<p>While tidewater Virginia, the coastal swampy portion, makes up about one-quarter of today’s Virginia, colonial Virginia also included today’s mountainous West Virginia and Kentucky. For this reason, colonial Virginia was mostly hills and mountains, though that region was lightly populated.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-geographic-characteristics-of-the-thirteen-colonies>What are the geographic characteristics of the Thirteen Colonies?</h2>
<p>Within each region, the colonies exhibited similar climates, agricultural products, religious practices, manufacturing products and natural resources. The geographic characteristics of the colonies within each region shared many congruent features, also. The New England Colonies</p>
<h2 id=how-did-geography-affect-the-economy-of-the-middle-colonies>How did geography affect the economy of the Middle Colonies?</h2>
<p>Geography Influences the Economy. The Middle colonies were called the breadbasket of the New World. The landscape made growing grains a profitable venture for these colonists. The Southern colonies used their land for cash crops such as tobacco and rice. They were able to export these items in exchange for cash with Britain.</p>
