<h2 id=what-did-sailors-do-on-ships>What did sailors do on ships?</h2>
<p>At the beginning of their career, sailors are often responsible for more of the menial chores on a ship. This can include scrubbing the decks, cleaning the living and eating quarters, and operating the winches. New sailors are often called deck hands, and they are the lowest on the sailing totem pole.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-do-on-ships>What did people do on ships?</h2>
<p>Seamen could be ‘tarred and feathered’, tied to a rope, swung overboard and ducked or ‘keel-hauled’, dragged round the underneath of the ship. Flogging was the most common, with the whole crew often made to watch. A rope’s end was used, or the infamous ‘cat o’ nine tails’.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-old-sailing-ship-called>What is an old sailing ship called?</h2>
<p>Iron-hulled sailing ships, often referred to as “windjammers” or “tall ships”, represented the final evolution of sailing ships at the end of the Age of Sail. They were built to carry bulk cargo for long distances in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-were-old-sailing-ships>How long were old sailing ships?</h2>
<p>About 75 feet (23 m) long, the typical caravel had two or three pole masts, lateen-rigged (i.e., with triangular sails). Later versions, the redonda, replaced the main lateen sail which required a large crew by a square sail which also made for more speed when running offshore.</p>
<h2 id=do-ships-stop-at-night>Do ships stop at night?</h2>
<p>Cruise ships always sail at night so they spend all day in a new port where the passengers can go ashore and explore.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-yacht-with-3-masts-called>What is a yacht with 3 masts called?</h2>
<p>Rig: 3 Masted Schooner. Schooner – a sailing vessel with fore and aft sails on three masts.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-longest-sailing-ship-ever-built>What was the longest sailing ship ever built?</h2>
<p>She shared this title with another American-built ship, the steamship Adriatic. She was also the largest full-rigged ship ever built in the United States….Great Republic (1853 clipper)</p>
<table><tr><th>History</th></tr><tr><th>US</th></tr><tr><td>Displacement</td><td>~6,600 tons (5,000 tons cargo plus 1,600 tons ship’s mass)</td></tr><tr><td>Length</td><td>334 ft (102 m) 400 ft (122 m) over all length</td></tr><tr><td>Beam</td><td>53 ft (16 m)</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-replaced-the-galleon>What replaced the Galleon?</h2>
<p>The galleon continued to be used into the 18th century, by which time purpose-built vessels such as the fluyt, the brig and the full-rigged ship, both as a trading vessel and ship of the line, rendered it obsolete for trade and warfare respectively.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-girl-apply-for-navy>Can a girl apply for Navy?</h2>
<p>Women have to compete with male candidates on an open merit system in Short Service. The selection of the candidates will be purely based on merit in the Services Selection Board. The Government of India has also approved the Permanent Commission for women in Law, Education and Naval Architecture Cadre.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-job-of-the-crew-of-a-ship>What was the job of the crew of a ship?</h2>
<p>Typical jobs on board included cook, parson, surgeon, master gunner, boatswain (in charge of the sails), carpenter and quartermaster. Other members of the crew would, of course, carry out all the duties, including keeping watch, handling sails, and cleaning decks.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-sailing-ship-uneconomical-in-the-beginning>Why was the sailing ship uneconomical in the beginning?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the steamships’ independence from the wind and their ability to take shorter routes, passing through the Suez and Panama Canals, made sailing ships uneconomical. Initially sails provided supplementary power to ships with oars, because the sails were not designed to sail to windward.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-sailors-get-paid-in-the-1700s>What did sailors get paid in the 1700s?</h2>
<p>By the end of the 1700s, pay on a naval ship was less than that on a merchant ship. However, as well as basic wages, sailors would expect to have a share of prize money or booty from captured enemy vessels. What did seamen do off duty?</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-men-who-work-on-a-ship>What are the names of the men who work on a ship?</h2>
<p>It is interesting to note that the names for jobs of men responsible for working a ship (boatswain, coxswain, seamen) are of Anglo-Saxon origin, while those of officers (Captain, Lieutenant, Admiral) are of Norman-French origin. This is an indication of a class distinction between roles on board.</p>
