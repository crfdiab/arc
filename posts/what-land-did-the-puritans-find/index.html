<h2 id=what-land-did-the-puritans-find>What land did the Puritans find?</h2>
<p>A much larger group of English Puritans left England in the 1630s, establishing the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the New Haven Colony, the Connecticut Colony, and Rhode Island.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-puritans-wanted-to-do>What did Puritans wanted to do?</h2>
<p>The Puritan wanted to “purify” the Church of England of its remaining Catholic influence and rituals and to return to the simple faith of the New Testament. The Puritans did not want to separate entirely from the Church of England. The Puritan wanted to make reforms or changes.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-the-puritans-in-north-america>What was the history of the Puritans in North America?</h2>
<p>History of the Puritans in North America. In the early 17th century, thousands of English Puritans settled in North America, mainly in New England. Puritans were generally members of the Church of England who believed that the Church of England was insufficiently reformed, retaining too much of its Roman Catholic doctrinal roots,…</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-puritans-leave-the-church-of-england>Why did the Puritans leave the Church of England?</h2>
<p>They took a different stance on the clerical dress, and episcopal system among other beliefs that closely related with Catholicism. Through strategy and luck, Puritans came to power after the First English Civil War. Eventually, most left the Church of England. However, the church incorporated some of the Puritans’ beliefs.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-puritans-establish-the-massachusetts-bay-colony>When did the Puritans establish the Massachusetts Bay Colony?</h2>
<p>The Pilgrims were a Separatist group, and they established the Plymouth Colony in 1620. Non-separating Puritans played leading roles in establishing the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629, the Saybrook Colony in 1635, the Connecticut Colony in 1636, and the New Haven Colony in 1638.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-theology-of-the-puritans-during-elizabeth-i>What was the theology of the Puritans during Elizabeth I?</h2>
<p>During the reign of Elizabeth I, Puritans were for the most part tolerated within the established church. Like Puritans, most English Protestants at the time were Calvinist in their theology, and many bishops and Privy Council members were sympathetic to Puritan objectives.</p>
