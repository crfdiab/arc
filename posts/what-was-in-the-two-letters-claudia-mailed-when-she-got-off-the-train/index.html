<p>From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler Chapters 1-2 Review</p>
<table><tr><th>A</th><th>B</th></tr><tr><td>What was in the two letters that Claudia mailed when she and Jamie got off the bus?</td><td>One letter to parents telling them not to call the FBI. The other was two boxtops from cornflakes for a refund of $.25 for milk.</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-was-claudia-crying-so-much>Why was Claudia crying so much?</h2>
<p>After a false alarm of discovery, Claudia is devastated and cries. Now that she finally has the proof, Claudia cries because she is so overwhelmed. Mrs. Frankweiler says she will give them the documents in her will.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-claudia-put-in-the-mailbox>What did Claudia put in the mailbox?</h2>
<p>She brings her little brother Jamie because he is quiet and has saved his money. Claudia is twelve and Jamie is nine, so they are going to be missed. They are going to the museum by train, and Claudia stops to mail a letter. They send you twenty-five cents if you mail them two box tops with stars on the tops.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-claudia-and-jamie-end-up-in-chapter-8>Where do Claudia and Jamie end up in Chapter 8?</h2>
<p>Jamie and Claudia gather up their things and go to the Laundromat. They can’t resist stopping by the post office, even though it’s too early in the day for mail. Even when they’re out and about, every day is an opportunity for learning (at least according to Claudia). They go to the U.N.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-saying-the-phrase-hide-out-in-using-incorrect-grammar>Why is saying the phrase hide out in using incorrect grammar?</h2>
<p>Expert Answers I think that Claudia would not admit that she had said the words “hide out in” because she did not want to admit to being wrong, but was too focused on the matter at hand to really think about what she had just said.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-claudia-find-the-train-pass>Where did Claudia find the train pass?</h2>
<p>How did Claudia find the ticket for the train? It was in her brother’s wastebasket. The ticket was under the couch. It was in her parent’s wastebasket.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-claudia-and-jamie-go-to-work-on-the-mystery-of-the-angel>Where did Claudia and Jamie go to work on the mystery of the angel?</h2>
<p>From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler Chapters 5-6 Review</p>
<table><tr><th>A</th><th>B</th></tr><tr><td>Where Claudia and Jamie went to work on the mystery of the angel</td><td>Library</td></tr><tr><td>Task Claudia assigned to Jamie to do their search</td><td>Look through books of photographs to find a photo of the angel statue</td></tr><tr><td>Artist some people believed carved the angel</td><td>Michelangelo</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=where-do-claudia-and-jamie-take-a-bath-in-chapter-5>Where do Claudia and Jamie take a bath in Chapter 5?</h2>
<p>In the museum’s restaurant, there is a huge fountain that Claudia and Jamie get into in order to bathe.</p>

<h2 id=why-did-claudia-continue-to-search-for-mrs-frankweiler>Why did Claudia continue to search for Mrs Frankweiler?</h2>
<p>Claudia learns her deep motive for persisting in the crazy search: she wanted a secret of her own to treasure and keep. Mrs. Frankweiler may get “grandchildren” who delight her. Her lawyer (who is revealed to be the children’s maternal grandfather) gets a luncheon date at the Met, to revise her will.</p>
