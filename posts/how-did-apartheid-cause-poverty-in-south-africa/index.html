<p>During the apartheid years, black women were forced into the rural areas to live off the land, without opportunities and choices allowing them to build decent lives for themselves. Customs or traditions further contribute to the poverty of women.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-impacts-of-apartheid>What were the impacts of apartheid?</h2>
<p>Apartheid has negatively affected the lives of all South African children but its effects have been particularly devastating for black children. The consequences of poverty, racism and violence have resulted in psychological disorders, and a generation of maladjusted children may be the result.</p>

<p>The economy was however very closed and very little trade took place between South Africa and the rest of the world during the Apartheid years. Strict rules regarding the flow of money out of South Africa was in place too, leading to little money leaving the country.</p>

<p>Apartheid was doomed because it thought it could trump economics. It was wrong – and it paid the price. Feinstein, Charles.

<p>The Great Depression and World War II brought increasing economic woes to South Africa , and convinced the government to strengthen its policies of racial segregation. In 1948, the Afrikaner National Party won the general election under the slogan “ apartheid ” (literally “apartness”). How did apartheid affect the world?</p>
