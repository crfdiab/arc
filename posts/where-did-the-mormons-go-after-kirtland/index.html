<h2 id=where-did-the-mormons-go-after-kirtland>Where did the Mormons go after Kirtland?</h2>
<p>In 1838, Smith and many of his followers, facing growing hostility from other Ohioans, moved westward. The Mormons eventually settled in Carthage, Illinois, where a mob killed Smith on June 27, 1844. The Mormons then moved further west, eventually settling along the Great Salt Lake in modern-day Utah.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-mormon-pioneers-leave-nauvoo>When did Mormon pioneers leave Nauvoo?</h2>
<p>1846<br>
Exodus, Part One Although Young hoped to begin the migration in spring 1846, local hostility forced the Mormons’ hand. The first wave of about 3,000 people began to leave Nauvoo in early February, and their suffering was intense. They crossed the frozen Mississippi River — dry-shod.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-mormons-move-from-new-york>Why did Mormons move from New York?</h2>
<p>The Mormons, as they were commonly known, had moved west to escape religious discrimination. After the murder of founder and prophet Joseph Smith, they knew they had to leave their old settlement in Illinois. Many Mormons died in the cold, harsh winter months as they made their way over the Rocky Mountains to Utah.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-leman-copley-leave-the-church>Why did Leman Copley leave the church?</h2>
<p>When the members of the branch of the Church of Christ from Colesville, New York came to settle in Ohio, Copley was persuaded allow them to settle on his large farm of nearly 1000 acres. Then, when he and the church had a falling out, he forced them all to leave.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-mormons-go-after-new-york>Where did Mormons go after New York?</h2>
<p>Their leader assassinated and their homes under attack, the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormons) of Nauvoo, Illinois, begin a long westward migration that eventually brings them to the valley of the Great Salt Lake in Utah.</p>
<h2 id=what-became-of-leman-copley>What became of Leman Copley?</h2>
<p>The vacillating Copley continued to teeter in his devotion to the restored Church for many years after his mission to the Shakers. He finally broke company with the Church permanently around 1838 and remained in Ohio the rest of his life.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-leman-copley-baptized>When was Leman Copley baptized?</h2>
<p>March 1831<br>
Leman, a member of the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing (Shakers), left the Shaker movement and was baptized a member of the Church in March 1831.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-mormons-move-to-kirtland-ohio>When did the Mormons move to Kirtland Ohio?</h2>
<p>In late 1830, Joseph Smith received a revelation commanding him and the other Mormons to move to Kirtland, Ohio, where a strong congregation had sprung up. In January 1831, Joseph Smith arrived in Kirtland and greeted the new converts.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-mormons-move-to-the-west>Why did the Mormons move to the west?</h2>
<p>An important reason for moving was that the Mormons wanted to escape the non-Mormons they despised, and called the Gentiles. They thought Gentiles were…the lowest of men and disliked their midnight parties, their sabbath-breaking, horse racing and gambling. The Mormons also had other reasons for moving: The Gentiles persecuted them.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-did-the-mormons-borrow-from-kirtland>How much money did the Mormons borrow from Kirtland?</h2>
<p>Some years later he compiled a list of still outstanding Kirtland loans, which amounted to more than $33,000. If one adds to these the two great loans of $30,000 and $60,000 borrowed in New York and Buffalo in 1836, it would seem that the Mormon leaders owed to non-Mormon individuals and firms well over $150,000.”</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-headquarters-of-the-mormon-church>Where was the headquarters of the Mormon Church?</h2>
<p>In 1837, problems at the church’s headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio, centering on the Kirtland Safety Society bank, led to schism. The church relocated from Kirtland to Far West, which became its new headquarters.</p>
