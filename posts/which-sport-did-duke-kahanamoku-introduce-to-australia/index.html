<p>surf Australian waves<br>
The romanticised tale about Letham goes like this: before the emergence of Walker’s story, most Australians who took an interest in such things thought Kahanamoku was the first man to surf Australian waves, when he arrived on Australian shores during the 1914-15 summer at the behest of the NSW Swimming Association.</p>
<h2 id=was-duke-kahanamoku-in-the-olympics>Was Duke Kahanamoku in the Olympics?</h2>
<p>Swimmer Duke Kahanamoku of Hawaii made his first Olympic appearance in 1912. Competing in the 100m freestyle, he equalled the world record in a qualifying heat. The 1916 Olympics were cancelled because of war, but when the Games resumed in 1920, Kahanamoku was there to defend his title.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-duke-kahanamoku-go-to-pennsylvania-to-compete>Why did Duke Kahanamoku go to Pennsylvania to compete?</h2>
<p>His supporters decided that the only thing they could do was raise money for Duke and another Hawaiian swimmer, Vincent Genoves, to travel to the Mainland to compete. In March of 1912 Duke Kahanamoku and fellow Hawaiian Vincent Genoves were in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania to compete for places on the American Olympic team.</p>

<p>By the time Duke Kahanamoku was born in 1890, surfing was very nearly lost. According to Sports Illustrated, his success as a swimmer in the first decades of the 20th century helped him bring more attention to his original love of surfing.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-duke-kahanamoku-born-and-when-did-he-die>When was Duke Kahanamoku born and when did he die?</h2>
<p>Duke Kahanamoku, in full Duke Paoa Kahinu Mokoe Hulikohola Kahanamoku, (born August 26, 1890, near Waikiki, Hawaii [now in the United States]—died January 22, 1968, Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.), Hawaiian surfer and swimmer who won three Olympic gold medals for the United States and who for several years was considered…</p>

<p>Instead, he focused on making the U.S. Olympic Men’s Swimming Team, set to compete in Stockholm for the 1912 Games. In a May 1912 qualifying meet in Philadelphia for the 100-meter freestyle event, Kahanamoku swept the field with a time of 60 seconds.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-duke-kahanamoku-set-three-world-records>When did Duke Kahanamoku set three World Records?</h2>
<p>Kahanamoku set three universally recognized world records in the 100-yard freestyle between July 5, 1913, and September 5, 1917 (53 seconds; broken by Johnny Weissmuller in 1922). In the 100-yard freestyle Kahanamoku was U.S. indoor champion in 1913 and outdoor titleholder in 1916–17 and 1920.</p>
