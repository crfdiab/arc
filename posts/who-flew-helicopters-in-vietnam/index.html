<h2 id=who-flew-helicopters-in-vietnam>Who flew helicopters in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Gerald Hickey spent 17 years as a civilian in Vietnam, both before and during the U.S.-led war. While working as an ethnographer for the RAND Corporation, Hickey often rode in Army Huey helicopters, accompanying Green Berets on visits to remote villages.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-helicopter-pilots-died-in-vietnam>How many helicopter pilots died in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>2,165<br>
Total helicopter pilots killed in the Vietnam War was 2,165. Total non-pilot crew members were 2,712. Based on a database received from the Pentagon, the VHPA estimate that more than 40,000 helicopter pilots served in the Vietnam War. Killed in Hueys – 1,151 pilots and 1,231 non-pilot crew members.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-vietnam-pilots-died>How many Vietnam pilots died?</h2>
<p>Almost all were Army. Total helicopter pilots killed in the Vietnam War was 2,202. Total non-pilot crew members was 2704.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-marines-were-deployed-to-vietnam>How many Marines were deployed to Vietnam?</h2>
<p>There were 298,498 active-duty Marines in 1968—and 81,249 of them were in Vietnam. The deployment included 21 of 36 battalions, 14 of 33 fixed-wing air squadrons, and 13 out of 24 helicopter squadrons.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-highest-ranking-officer-killed-in-vietnam>Who was the highest ranking officer killed in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Harold J. Greene<br>
Robinson was killed during the Vietnam War in May 1972. To date, Greene is also the highest-ranking American officer to be killed in combat in the ongoing Global War on Terrorism….</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-minimum-age-of-a-us-marine-in-vietnam>What was the minimum age of a US Marine in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>14 years old<br>
The youngest Vietnam War US Marine was just 14 years old.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-vietnam-vets-have-died>What percentage of Vietnam vets have died?</h2>
<p>It was apparently based on an estimate that 800,000 Vietnam-era veterans had died by 2000. That number was reasonable: About 9.2 million Americans served in the military during the Vietnam era (1964-75), so that would mean about 8 percent of them had died and 92 percent were still alive.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-the-f-4-in-the-vietnam-war>What was the role of the F 4 in the Vietnam War?</h2>
<p>Though the latest adopter of the F-4, the USAF became its largest user. During Vietnam, USAF F-4s fulfilled both air superiority and ground support roles. As F-105 Thunderchief losses grew, the F-4 carried more and more of the ground support burden and by the end of the war was the USAF’s primary all-around aircraft.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-mystery-fighter-in-the-vietnam-war>Who was the mystery fighter in the Vietnam War?</h2>
<p>As they flew their F-4J on a strike against the Hai Dong railyards, their formation came under attack by MiG-17s. Cunningham turned sharply toward one and shot it down with a Sidewinder missile. He then saw his wingman locked in a dogfight against eight MiG-17s.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-commander-of-the-f-4-phantom>Who was the commander of the F 4 Phantom?</h2>
<p>The multipurpose fighter saw extensive combat duty during the Vietnam War, including serving as Major Gary L. Retterbush, the pilot of Finch 3, an F-4E Phantom II. Finch flight was a flight of four Phantoms led by Lt. Col. Lyle Beckers, the squadron commander of the 35th Tactical Fighter Squadron.</p>

<p>In addition, a photo-reconnaissance variant, the RF-4C, was used by four squadrons. During the Vietnam War, the USAF lost a total of 528 F-4s (of all types) to enemy action with the majority being down by anti-aircraft fire or surface-to-air missiles. In exchange, USAF F-4s downed 107.5 enemy aircraft.</p>
