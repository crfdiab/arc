<h2 id=what-happens-if-the-greenhouse-gas-layer-becomes-too-thick>What happens if the greenhouse gas layer becomes too thick?</h2>
<p>As the layer of greenhouse gases (the ‘glass roof’) gets thicker, more of the Sun’s heat is trapped inside the atmosphere – and this causes the planet to heat up. Global warming is one of the most significant factors in man-made climate change.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-earth-if-you-increase-carbon-dioxide>What happens to Earth if you increase carbon dioxide?</h2>
<p>It absorbs less heat per molecule than the greenhouse gases methane or nitrous oxide, but it’s more abundant and it stays in the atmosphere much longer. Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide are responsible for about two-thirds of the total energy imbalance that is causing Earth’s temperature to rise.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-co2-thicken-the-atmosphere>How does CO2 thicken the atmosphere?</h2>
<p>Making the Blanket Thicker Since the late 1800s, humans have been burning fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas—to get energy. Burning these fuels, generates tons of extra CO2, which makes the heat-trapping blanket thicker and thicker, warming the planet.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-earth-not-affected-by-too-much-carbon-dioxide>How is Earth not affected by too much carbon dioxide?</h2>
<p>How is Earth NOT affected by too much carbon dioxide? The greenhouse effect is decreased. Human output of carbon dioxide is minor compared to natural sources, such as volcanoes. a car parked in the sun with the windows rolled up.</p>
<h2 id=what-will-happen-if-greenhouse-gases-absorb-too-much-heat-and-radiated-back-to-earth>What will happen if greenhouse gases absorb too much heat and radiated back to Earth?</h2>
<p>The added greenhouse gases absorb the heat. They then radiate this heat. Some of the heat will head away from the Earth, some of it will be absorbed by another greenhouse gas molecule, and some of it will wind up back at the planet’s surface again. With more greenhouse gases, heat will stick around, warming the planet.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-carbon-dioxide-affect-the-earths-atmosphere>How does carbon dioxide affect the Earth’s atmosphere?</h2>
<p>Carbon dioxide traps radiation at ground level, creating ground-level ozone. This atmospheric layer prevents the earth from cooling at night. One result is a warming of ocean waters. Oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, higher water temperatures compromise the oceans’ ability to absorb carbon dioxide.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-run-out-of-carbon-dioxide>What happens if you run out of carbon dioxide?</h2>
<p>The earth would be much cooler. Carbon Dioxide is a “greenhouse” gas. It helps capture the heat of sunlight, warming the earth. There would be no life, because plants depend on carbon dioxide, and animal life depends on plants. What will happen if you run out of carbon dioxide?</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-environmental-effects-of-carbon-dioxide>What are the environmental effects of carbon dioxide?</h2>
<p>Carbon dioxide is a contributor to the environmental effect known as acid rain. Emissions released from fossil fuel-burning energy plants combine with moisture in the air. The result is precipitation with a high acid content. Documented evidence shows the physical damage to trees and other plant life.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-carbon-dioxide-affect-the-whole-canopy>How does carbon dioxide affect the whole canopy?</h2>
<p>For shorter-term whole canopy processes, it is best defined as the ratio of the photosynthetic carbon dioxide uptake rate per unit land area to the transpiration rate per unit land area. Figure 7.2 demonstrates the effect of climate on WUE.</p>
