<h2 id=what-minerals-are-mined-in-connecticut>What minerals are mined in Connecticut?</h2>
<p>Connecticut’s complex geologic past provided our forefathers with a substantial mineral legacy. Significant iron ore deposits, copper ore, garnets, marble, limestone, basalt and brownstone all provide or have provided for profitable mining operations in our state at one time or another.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-pan-for-gold-in-ct>Can you pan for gold in CT?</h2>
<p>The gold that is found here is almost always very fine textured, so use careful gold panning techniques to ensure that you retain the gold in you pan. One place that gold can be found near Harford, Connecticut is in the Farmington River to the north. Another known gold bearing area in Litchfield County is Spruce Brook.</p>
<h2 id=what-gemstones-are-found-in-connecticut>What gemstones are found in Connecticut?</h2>
<p>Connecticut’s gems include amethyst, topaz, green beryl, rose quartz, tourmaline, yellow beryl and aquamarine, and they are found primarily in the Bronson Hill anticlinorium, east of the Connecticut Valley. Roxbury Falls holds the best-known Connecticut garnets.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-gold-found-in-connecticut>Where is gold found in Connecticut?</h2>
<p>Yes, there is gold in Connecticut. Not a lot, but enough to tease and tempt. In Litchfield County, the two hot spots for prospecting are Lead Mine Brook, above the Thomaston Dam, and Spruce Brook in East Litchfield. Spruce Brook, in East Litchfield or Campville, was the scene of quite a little gold rush in the 1850s.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-find-amethyst-in-connecticut>Where can you find amethyst in Connecticut?</h2>
<p>Amethyst from Connecticut, USA</p>

<p>Connecticut is similar to many other New England states in that almost all the gold is placer gold found in small glacial deposits, mostly in Litchfield County, in the northwestern portion of the state.</p>
<h2 id=has-gold-been-found-in-ct>Has gold been found in CT?</h2>
<h2 id=is-there-gold-in-the-finger-lakes>Is there gold in the Finger Lakes?</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, the gold rush is still alive and well. That is, at least, with the help of one family who brings the unique ability to pan for gold to the Finger Lakes Region. A sign that read “Pan For Gold” advertized to passers by.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-mineral-is-the-state-mineral-of-connecticut>What kind of mineral is the state mineral of Connecticut?</h2>
<p>Garnet: The State Mineral of Connecticut. In 1977, the Connecticut General Assembly designated the mineral garnet, variety almandine, as the state mineral. The garnet “group” of minerals is well known from many localities around the state. Both ornamental and functional, garnet is readily identified by its small granular crystals,…</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-most-mines-located-in-connecticut>Where are the most mines located in Connecticut?</h2>
<p>Litchfield, Middlesex, and New Haven are the with the most mines. 152 records of mines in Connecticut. 23 records of mineral occurrences of observable ore mineralization. 1 Grade, tonnage, and extent of mineralization for such mines are unspecified.</p>
<h2 id=where-to-find-rare-gems-and-minerals-in-connecticut>Where to find rare gems and minerals in Connecticut?</h2>
<p>The mineral has several other important characteristics that you should look out for such as the vitreous luster, transparent or translucent crystals, hardness of 3-3.5 and the specific gravity of about 4.5. In Connecticut, barite is mined in the Jinny Hill mines in Cheshire. However, you can also find it in several other places across the state.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-gold-in-the-state-of-connecticut>Is there gold in the state of Connecticut?</h2>
<p>If highly concentrated oreis present in large amounts, the state of Connecticut might be in line for an unexpected windfall, since the gold apparently is on state land. But geologists say the veins may extend the boundaries of state land onto private property.</p>
