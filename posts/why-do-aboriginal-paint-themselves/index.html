<h2 id=why-do-aboriginal-paint-themselves>Why do aboriginal paint themselves?</h2>
<p>The specific designs and motifs used by the Aboriginals reveal their relationships to their family group, social position, tribe, precise ancestors, totemic fauna and tracts of land. The person adorned with the body paint often takes on the spiritual part of their ancestor dancing, immersed in their character.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-aboriginal-handprints-meaning>What do Aboriginal handprints meaning?</h2>
<p>Aboriginal hand stencils on a rock. Hand stencils were left to mark a territory and define a rank. The higher the stencil in relationship to others the higher the person’s rank.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-body-painting-important-to-the-aboriginal-people>Why was body painting important to the Aboriginal people?</h2>
<p>Aboriginal Body Painting Art Aboriginal body painting or art and personal ornamentation is an ancient tradition which carries deep spiritual significance for the Australian Indigenous People. Their cultural rituals including body painting differ between Aboriginal Tribes and topographic location.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-aboriginal-paintings-take-place>Where did the first Aboriginal paintings take place?</h2>
<p>Although Australian Aboriginals have been using ochres as body paint, on bark and rocks for tens of thousands of years it was not until the 1930’s that the first paintings were done. These were not done in ochre or in dot art but in water colour at the Hermannsburg mission near Alice Springs.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rock-is-used-for-aboriginal-body-painting>What kind of rock is used for Aboriginal body painting?</h2>
<p>Ochre a soft rock is crushed and mixed with animal fat snd used to apply the designs ash and clay are also used. The body art may stay in place for some time as some ceremonies may last several days and nights which includes dancing, singing and story-telling. Aboriginal body Painting is a special and necessary part of all Aboriginal ceremonies.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-aboriginal-artists-in-australia>Why are there so many Aboriginal artists in Australia?</h2>
<p>Now there is much Aboriginal art being produced in hundreds of remote communities around Australia and by urban Aboriginal artists. Supporting Aboriginal art has a secondary effect in supporting the language and culture of Indigenous families who chose to live in remote locations linked to their own ancestral lands.</p>
