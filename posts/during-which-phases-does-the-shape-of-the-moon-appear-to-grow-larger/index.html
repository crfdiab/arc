<h2 id=during-which-phases-does-the-shape-of-the-moon-appear-to-grow-larger>During which phases does the shape of the moon appear to grow larger?</h2>
<p>A few days after the first quarter, the Moon starts to look like an oval. This phase is called waxing gibbous. “Waxing” means “to grow larger.” “Gibbous” means “an oval shape.”</p>
<h2 id=when-the-visible-portion-of-the-moon-appears-to-be-growing-larger-is-it-waxing-or-waning>When the visible portion of the moon appears to be growing larger is it waxing or waning?</h2>
<p>Go back to your drawings and label the Phase Name for position 3 “First Quarter” and the Phase Name for position 7 “Third Quarter.” The Moon is waxing when the visible portion of the Moon appears to be getting bigger. The Moon is waning when the visible portion of the Moon appears to be getting smaller.</p>
<h2 id=when-the-part-of-the-moon-that-you-can-see-is-slowly-getting-bigger-or-growing-it>When the part of the moon that you can see is slowly getting bigger or growing it?</h2>
<p>Waxing Gibbous – At this time half of the moon is lit up. The part that is lit is slowly getting bigger. Waxing means to slowly get bigger.</p>
<h2 id=when-the-moon-appears-to-be-getting-smaller-each-night-it-is-said-to-be>When the moon appears to be getting smaller each night it is said to be?</h2>
<p>A waning moon is any phase of the moon during the lunar cycle between the full moon and the new moon. It is a moon that is getting smaller every night. The lunar cycle is a period of about 29 days during which the moon’s shape changes from our vantage on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-moon-growing-bigger-what-is-it-called>When is the Moon growing bigger what is it called?</h2>
<p>It is called “waxing” before the full moon. It is called “waning” after the full moon. “Waxing” is a word that means “getting bigger”. “Waning” means “fading out”. Why does the moon seem bigger when it is rising? Moon illusion is when the moon seems bigger when it is rising. So really the moon is not bigger it is in the mind.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-bigger-a-half-moon-or-a-full-moon>Which is bigger a half moon or a full moon?</h2>
<p>Waxing Gibbous. The term “Gibbous” refers to the shape of the moon, which is bigger than a first-quarter moon and smaller than a full moon. The waxing-gibbous phase occurs between the half and full moon phases. During this phase, more 50% of the Moon’s lit surface is visible, and its size increases daily.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-crescent-shape-of-the-moon-appear>When does the crescent shape of the Moon appear?</h2>
<p>A crescent-shaped moon appears directly after the first lunar phase. The moon’s shape resembles a crescent and increases in size each day. This lunar phase lasts until 50% of its lit surface is illuminated. “Waxing” refers to the fact that the Moon’s crescent shape is increasing in size.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-far-side-of-the-moon-look-like>What does the far side of the Moon look like?</h2>
<p>At that point, the far side of the Moon is facing the Sun. This phase is called a new moon. During the new moon, the side facing Earth is dark. ? New: We cannot see the Moon when it is a new moon. ? Waxing Crescent: In the Northern Hemisphere, we see the waxing crescent phase as a thin crescent of light on the right.</p>
