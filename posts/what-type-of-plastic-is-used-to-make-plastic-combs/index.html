<h2 id=what-type-of-plastic-is-used-to-make-plastic-combs>What type of plastic is used to make plastic combs?</h2>
<p>The first plastic combs were made from nitro-cellulose or celluloid and later the “unbreakable” comb arrived in the 1940’s made of nylon. We find combs and brushes almost every time we go to Kehoe.</p>
<h2 id=which-material-is-used-in-manufacture-of-toys-combs>Which material is used in manufacture of toys combs?</h2>
<p>Polythene and PVC are some of the examples of thermoplastics. These are used for manufacturing toys, combs and various types of containers. On the other hand, there are some plastics which when moulded once, can not be softened by heating. These are called thermosetting plastics.</p>
<h2 id=which-polymer-is-used-for-making-combs>Which polymer is used for making combs?</h2>
<p>Bakelite is used in making combs, phonograph records, handles of various utensils and electrical switches. It is a copolymer of phenol and formaldehyde.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-plastic-polymers>What is the best plastic polymers?</h2>
<p>High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) is the best plastic polymer.</p>
<h2 id=is-thermoplastic-material>Is thermoplastic material?</h2>
<p>Thermoplastics are plastic polymers that soften when they are heated, allowing for molding, and solidify again as they are cooled. Because of their unique chemical properties, thermoplastic materials can be remolded and recycled without negatively affecting the material’s physical properties.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-thermosetting-plastics-give-two-examples>What are the thermosetting plastics give two examples?</h2>
<p>Common examples of thermoset plastics and polymers include epoxy, silicone, polyurethane and phenolic.</p>
<h2 id=which-polymer-is-used-in-electrical-switch>Which polymer is used in electrical switch?</h2>
<p>Bakelite polymer which is used for making electrical switches and combs.</p>
<h2 id=is-buna-n-condensation-polymer>Is Buna N condensation polymer?</h2>
<p>Copolymer is the polymer which is formed by addition polymerization of two different monomers, such as Buna-N, Buna-S etc. So, Buna-N is a copolymer. Nylon-66 is a condensation polymer. The monomers of Nylon-66 are adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-raw-materials-for-comb-polymer>What are the raw materials for comb polymer?</h2>
<p>Comb polymer: A combination of linear PAMA and polyolefin chemistries. In this novel structure, polyolefin macroalcohols, based on poly(isobutene) or hydrogenated poly(butadiene) with molecular weights in the range 1000–10 000 g mol −1, are used as key raw materials.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-plastic-comb-or-wooden-comb>Which is better plastic comb or wooden comb?</h2>
<p>Wooden brushes are better than polymer plastics combs. Due to use of plastic comb regularly on our hairs an electrostatic charge develop on comb and hairs both which makes our hairs look dry. The wooden comb doesn’t develop any kind of electrostatic cha… Loading…</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-comb-to-use-for-hair>What’s the best comb to use for hair?</h2>
<p>Wooden comb and brushes are the good option for hair. Wooden brushes are better than polymer plastics combs. Due to use of plastic comb regularly on our hairs an electrostatic charge develop on comb and hairs both which makes our hairs look dry.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-plastic-is-used-to-make-food>What kind of plastic is used to make food?</h2>
<p>PETE is a durable, transparent plastic commonly used to make beverage and food product bottles and jars as well as microwaveable food trays and ovenproof plastic wrap. When recycled, it becomes part of new plastic containers, carpet yarns, polyester textiles, strapping materials and molds used in engineering.</p>
