<h2 id=who-enforces-the-wilderness-act>Who enforces the Wilderness Act?</h2>
<p>The National Park Service<br>
The National Park Service is responsible for preserving the wilderness character of these areas. 1 Pub.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-wilderness-areas-designated>How are wilderness areas designated?</h2>
<p>How is wilderness designated? Federal lands qualifying as wilderness must be designated by Congress through legislation. In some cases, federal agencies recommend suitable lands. The process culminates when the legislation is passed by Congress and is signed by the President.</p>
<h2 id=who-manages-the-wilderness-area>Who manages the wilderness area?</h2>
<p>The National Wilderness Preservation System (NWPS) is co-managed by the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Forest Service. Each federal agency manages several individual wilderness units that differ in size and geography.</p>
<h2 id=do-wilderness-areas-need-congressional-approval>Do wilderness areas need congressional approval?</h2>
<p>(Congressional approval) Each recommendation of the President for designation as “wilderness” shall become effective only if so provided by an Act of Congress.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-you-legally-live-in-the-wilderness>How can you legally live in the wilderness?</h2>
<p>Buying land</p>
<ol>
<li>The simplest way to live in the wilderness legally is to buy a small plot of land.</li>
<li>However, if you are planning on bringing an RV along or living in a tent, then you can buy a parcel of land for a few thousand dollars.</li>
<li>These pieces of land do not come up for sale all that often.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-uses-of-wilderness>What are the main uses of wilderness?</h2>
<p>A: The “multiple-uses” of wilderness, according to law, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protection of watersheds.</li>
<li>Habitat for wildlife, including rare and endangered species.</li>
<li>Maintenance of soil and water quality, ecological stability and plant and animal gene pools.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-percent-of-usa-is-wilderness>What percent of USA is wilderness?</h2>
<p>5 percent<br>
What percentage of America’s landmass is protected as wilderness? Just 5 percent of the nation’s landmass is permanently safeguarded as wilderness, and nearly half of that (2.3 percent) lies in Alaska. Only 2.7 percent of the contiguous United States enjoys this “gold standard” of protection.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-live-in-the-wilderness-for-free>Can I live in the wilderness for free?</h2>
<p>The National Parks will often allow you to camp out in the wilderness, but you are going to need to have a permit. If you camp on BLM land, however, then do bear in mind that you are going to be less free than if you bought your own land. In most cases, you won’t be able to stay in the same place for too long.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-live-in-the-forest>Is it illegal to live in the forest?</h2>
<p>Many boondockers do so. It’s not illegal to keep moving from forest to forest, or even to just a different part of the same forest. The U.S. Forest Service has rules making it illegal to establish residency in a national forest.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-wilderness-study-areas-designated-by-congress>How are wilderness study areas designated by Congress?</h2>
<p>Bureau of Land Management and National Forest System (Forest Service) Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs) are designated by Congress for further study before final designation as wilderness.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-wilderness-areas-are-there-in-the-united-states>How many wilderness areas are there in the United States?</h2>
<p>Wilderness areas can be part of national parks, national wildlife refuges, national forests or public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. There are more than 680 wilderness areas — protecting over 106 million acres in 44 states — with the most recent one designated being Boulder White Clouds in Idaho.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-description-of-a-wilderness-area>Which is the best description of a wilderness area?</h2>
<p>Wilderness areas are one type of protected area listed under the IUCN classification system. In the United States, as well as in other countries, all portions of the lands spectrum —from developed to free-willed— are important, and many land classifications for public lands compliment wilderness.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-changes-to-the-wilderness-system>Are there any changes to the wilderness system?</h2>
<p>While there has never yet been a wholesale removal of a wilderness from the National Wilderness Preservation System, land swaps and boundary adjustments are neither frequent nor uncommon.</p>
