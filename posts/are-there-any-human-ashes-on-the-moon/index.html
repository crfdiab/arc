<h2 id=are-there-any-human-ashes-on-the-moon>Are there any human ashes on the Moon?</h2>
<p>To date, the late scientist Eugene Shoemaker is still the only person whose remains have been sent to the Moon. Even casual stargazers are likely to recognize Shoemaker’s name from the famed Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (which had broken into fragments) that impacted Jupiter in 1994.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-only-person-to-have-their-ashes-scattered-on-the-moon>Who is the only person to have their ashes scattered on the Moon?</h2>
<p>Eugene Shoemaker: The Only Human Buried on the Moon. He trained astronauts and founded a new science. Born on April 28, 1928, Eugene “Gene” Shoemaker was one of the 20th century’s great minds.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-have-your-ashes-sent-to-the-moon>How much does it cost to have your ashes sent to the Moon?</h2>
<p>Celestial funeral firm Elysium Space is now offering a “Lunar Memorial,” in which your cremated remains are privately dispatched to the moon. But it’ll cost you—the early bird rate starts at $9,950 for the first 50 participants, but costs $11,950 thereafter.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-scatter-your-ashes-in-space>Can you scatter your ashes in space?</h2>
<p>The Memorial Launch carries all your loved one’s ashes and scatters them in space, while the Voyager service sends a ceremonial portion of your loved one’s ashes to space and returns them to your care afterwards. Learn more about each package below.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-telescope-powerful-enough-to-see-the-flag-on-the-moon>Is there a telescope powerful enough to see the flag on the moon?</h2>
<p>Can you see an American flag on the moon with a telescope? Even the powerful Hubble Space Telescope isn’t strong enough to capture pictures of the flags on the moon. But the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the unmanned spacecraft launched in 2009, is equipped with cameras to photograph the moon’s surface.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-spread-ashes-in-space>How much does it cost to spread ashes in space?</h2>
<p>You can send your loved one’s ashes into space on Elon Musk’s SpaceX rocket for $2,500. Elysium Space charges people $2,490 to send their loved one’s ashes into space. The capsule containing the ashes will orbit the Earth for two years before re-entering the atmosphere “as as shooting star”.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-be-shot-into-space-when-i-die>Can I be shot into space when I die?</h2>
<p>Celestis Memorial Spaceflights make the dream of spaceflight a reality by launching a symbolic portion of cremated remains into near-space, Earth orbit, to the lunar surface or even beyond.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-ok-to-scattering-ashes-on-top-of-a-mountain>Is it OK to scattering ashes on top of a mountain?</h2>
<p>While the idea of scattering ashes at the top of a mountain has a nice dramatic feel to it, most conservation organisations ask that you avoid this if possible. This is because human ashes contain minerals that can have an impact on the delicate plant life that grows on mountain summits.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-in-charge-of-scattering-the-ashes>Who is in charge of scattering the ashes?</h2>
<p>You can read all about the laws on burying ashes here. Who has the final say on where and how to scatter ashes? Only the funeral director or the person who signed the application for cremation form can collect the ashes from the crematorium, apart from in special cases.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-eugene-shoemaker-buried-on-the-moon>Why was Eugene Shoemaker buried on the Moon?</h2>
<p>“It brings a little closure, in a way, to our feelings,” Carolyn Shoemaker said in a 1998 press release of her husband’s otherworldly burial. “We will always know when we look at the moon, that Gene is there.”</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-only-person-buried-on-the-moon>Who is the only person buried on the Moon?</h2>
<p>Eugene Shoemaker was born on April 28, 1928. Cite This! Mark Mancini “Eugene Shoemaker: The Only Human Buried on the Moon” 26 April 2019.</p>
