<h2 id=does-germany-have-a-social-democratic-party>Does Germany have a social democratic party?</h2>
<p>The Social Democratic Party of Germany (German: Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, SPD; [zoˈtsi̯aːldemoˌkʁaːtɪʃə paʁˌtaɪ ˈdɔʏtʃlants]) is a social democratic political party in Germany. It is one of the two major contemporary political parties in Germany along with the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU).</p>

<h2 id=what-party-rules-germany>What party rules Germany?</h2>
<p>The Federal Republic of Germany has a plural multi-party system. The largest by members and parliament seats are the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), with its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) and Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-hitlers-early-life-like>What was Hitler’s early life like?</h2>
<p>After his father, Alois, retired as a state customs official, young Adolf spent most of his childhood in Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. Not wanting to follow in his father’s footsteps as a civil servant, he began struggling in secondary school and eventually dropped out.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-political-parties-set-up-in-germany>How are political parties set up in Germany?</h2>
<p>As the party list system suggests, German democracy is based around political parties – organizations set up to follow common sets of principles, and synchronize their efforts in the various political institutions. These are the major political players right now:</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-government-do-they-have-in-germany>What kind of government do they have in Germany?</h2>
<p>Germany is a democratic, federal parliamentary republic, where federal legislative power is vested in the Bundestag (the parliament of Germany) and the Bundesrat (the representative body of the Länder, Germany’s regional states).</p>
<h2 id=why-does-germany-have-a-problem-with-democracy>Why does Germany have a problem with democracy?</h2>
<p>But where other countries are experimenting with bringing voices from the street into the political process, Germany’s dark history casts a shadow on efforts to break down barriers to political participation. There’s no question Germany would benefit from listening to its citizens and engaging in some talk therapy.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-be-a-german-citizen-to-understand-german-politics>Do you have to be a German citizen to understand German politics?</h2>
<p>When you move to Germany, getting to grips with how politics works is absolutely essential, especially for those who choose to become German citizens, but even foreign students need a little grounding in how power operates.</p>
