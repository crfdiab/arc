World No. 2 tennis player Naomi Osaka, who represents Japan, served as the final Olympic torchbearer for the Tokyo Olympic Games, lighting the Olympic flame during Friday night’s Opening Ceremony.</p>

<h2 id=is-the-olympic-torch-real-fire>Is the Olympic torch real fire?</h2>
<p>Sacred fires were present at many ancient Greek sanctuaries, including those at Olympia. Every four years, when Zeus was honoured at the Olympic Games, additional fires were lit at his temple and that of his wife, Hera. The modern Olympic flame is ignited in front of the ruins of the temple of Hera.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-drop-the-olympic-torch>What happens if you drop the Olympic torch?</h2>
<p>When a torch goes out, it is re-lit (or another torch is lit) from one of the backup sources. Thus, the fires contained in the torches and Olympic cauldrons all trace a common lineage back to the same Olympia lighting ceremony. Organizers quickly doused it again and re-lit it using a backup of the original flame.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-olympic-torch-go-out>Does the Olympic torch go out?</h2>
<p>After being lit, the flame in the Olympic cauldron continues to burn throughout the Games, until the closing ceremony, when it is finally put out, symbolizing the official end of the Games.</p>

<p>The Olympic cauldron itself has been extinguished by accident once, when a rainstorm hit the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was initially re-lit using a cigarette lighter, before being extinguished again and re-lit using a backup flame.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-olympic-flame-extinguished>Is the Olympic flame extinguished?</h2>
<p>TOKYO, Japan — The Olympic flame has been extinguished, officially marking the end of a pandemic-delayed and heavily restricted Tokyo Games after an exhausting, enlightening and sometimes enraging run. The baton has now been passed to Paris, which will host the Games in 2024.</p>

<p>About the torches First used at the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics, the modern torches of the Summer and Winter Olympics are built to resist the effects of wind and rain as they carry the Olympic flame, and bear unique designs that represent the host country and the spirit of the Games. 23 July – 8 August Tokyo 2020</p>

<p>The tradition of carrying the Olympic flame from Olympia, Greece, the birthplace of the Ancient Olympic Games, to the host city of the modern Olympic Games via a torch relay was first introduced in 1936, ahead of the 1936 Summer Olympics.</p>
