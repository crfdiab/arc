<h2 id=how-do-bushfires-affect-the-society>How do bushfires affect the society?</h2>
<p>A large bushfire can cause multiple direct impacts: on life and property, on the survival of fauna populations, on water resources, and indirectly on government budgets and insurance costs. A large bushfire will also generate huge amounts of smoke.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-does-fire-have-on-society>What impact does fire have on society?</h2>
<p>It plays a key role in shaping ecosystems by serving as an agent of renewal and change. But fire can be deadly, destroying homes, wildlife habitat and timber, and polluting the air with emissions harmful to human health. Fire also releases carbon dioxide—a key greenhouse gas—into the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-social-impacts-of-the-california-wildfires>What were the social impacts of the California wildfires?</h2>
<p>Previous research has established that wildfires create significant impacts on the mental and emotional health of survivors, including increased anxiety, depression or PTSD [19,20].</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-australian-bushfires-affect-society>How did the Australian bushfires affect society?</h2>
<p>Around 70 per cent of Australia’s population was exposed to bushfire smoke during the fires. That’s unprecedented. The smoke created health issues, issues for transport and aircraft operation, it had massive impacts on tourism. There were also impacts on agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-economic-impacts-of-wildfires>What are the economic impacts of wildfires?</h2>

<h2 id=what-are-the-impacts-of-the-bushfires-in-australia>What are the impacts of the bushfires in Australia?</h2>
<p>A literature review on the economic, social and environmental impacts of severe bushfires in south-eastern Australia Fire and adaptive management Summary v Severe bushfires are capable of causing widespread economic, social and environmental impacts across spatial and temporal dimensions.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-black-saturday-bushfires-affect-the-environment>How did the Black Saturday bushfires affect the environment?</h2>
<p>Environmental One of the major impacts from the Black Saturday bushfires was the huge amount of loss on flora and fauna. The RSPCA estimated that over one million animals died from the Black Saturday bushfires, and the animals that did survive were severely burnt. When kangaroos went to go back to their habitat they found their home ranges were…</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-bushfire-affect-the-human-health>How does a bushfire affect the human health?</h2>
<p>Less obviously, human health may be at risk in the aftermath of a bushfire through effects on the drinking water supply.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-fire-affect-plants-and-animals-in-national-parks>How does fire affect plants and animals in national parks?</h2>
<p>We manage fire in national parks to minimise the ecological impact on our wildlife and native vegetation. Fire is often associated with negative impacts on the environment. We usually think of the damage and devastation fire causes to wildlife and vegetation, but a fire event can also be beneficial for our plants and animals. For example, fire:</p>
