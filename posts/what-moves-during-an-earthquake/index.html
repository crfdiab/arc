<h2 id=what-moves-during-an-earthquake>What moves during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Earthquake Waves Body waves move through the inner part of the earth and surface waves travel over the earth’s surface. Body waves can travel very fast—up to 8 km a second. They travel through rock , water and gas .</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-no-movement-right-away-in-earthquake>Why is there no movement right away in earthquake?</h2>
<p>Ground Movements. Surface rupture of the 1999 M7. If these faults are stuck, then there may be no motion across them for tens to hundreds of years, during which time they build up stress until an earthquake occurs.</p>
<h2 id=where-should-you-not-go-during-an-earthquake>Where should you not go during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>DO NOT run outside or to other rooms during shaking: The area near the exterior walls of a building is the most dangerous place to be. Windows, facades and architectural details are often the first parts of the building to collapse.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-earth-move-when-there-is-an-earthquake>Why does the Earth Move when there is an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Such movement on the faults is generally a response to long-term deformation and the buildup of stress. Seismic waves from large earthquakes pass throughout the Earth. These waves contain vital information about the internal structure of the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-seismic-waves-travel-in-an-earthquake>Where do seismic waves travel in an earthquake?</h2>
<p>The point on the Earth’s surface directly above the focus is the epicenter. When energy is released at the focus, seismic waves travel outward from that point in all directions. There are different types of seismic waves, each one traveling at varying speeds and motions. It’s these waves that you feel during an earthquake.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-an-earthquake-more-likely-at-a-seismic-gap>Why is an earthquake more likely at a seismic gap?</h2>
<p>In terms of strain, explain why an earthquake is more likely at a seismic gap than at another location. A seismic gap lies along an active fault line. Therefore strain is accumulating at a steady rate and at some point, strain will become too great and an earthquake will occur.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-energy-go-during-an-earthquake>Where does the energy go during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Anatomy of an Earthquake. The point on the Earth’s surface directly above the focus is the epicenter. When energy is released at the focus, seismic waves travel outward from that point in all directions. There are different types of seismic waves, each one traveling at varying speeds and motions. It’s these waves that you feel during an earthquake.</p>
