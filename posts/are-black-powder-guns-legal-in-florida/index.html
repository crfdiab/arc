<h2 id=what-happens-if-a-convicted-felon-is-caught-with-a-gun-in-florida>What happens if a convicted felon is caught with a gun in Florida?</h2>

<h2 id=can-a-felon-own-a-black-powder-pistol>Can a felon own a black powder pistol?</h2>
<p>Yes. The law treats black powder pistols as firearms. But, technically, they are more of antique firearms. Although the law restricts felons from having conventional firearms, this provision does not cover antiques.</p>

<p>Felons in Florida are prohibited from owning firearms unless their rights have been restored by a court of law.

<h2 id=can-a-convicted-felon-own-a-muzzleloader-gun>Can a convicted felon own a muzzleloader gun?</h2>
<p>Technically, muzzleloaders are widely thought to be antique firearms. They do not belong in the class of banned firearms. However, the ban on felons ownership of regular firearms also extends to possession of associated ammunitions. That said; since it is designed with black powder – not cartridge or bullets – felons can own such ammunitions.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-convicted-felon-own-a-chemical-weapon-in-florida>Can a convicted felon own a chemical weapon in Florida?</h2>
<p>Florida statutes prohibit convicted felons from owning or possessing any type of electric or chemical weapon as well. Felons who have had their civil rights restored may have their gun rights reinstated.</p>
