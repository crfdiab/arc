<p>How did religion divide the Ottoman and Safavid empires? The Ottomans were of Sunni Islam and the Safavids were of Shia Islam. He took away all of the laws against non-Muslims, promoted religious tolerance, and established a strong central government.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-safavid-empire-influence-persia>How did the Safavid Empire influence Persia?</h2>
<p>From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over parts of Greater Iran and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the Sasanian Empire to establish a national state officially known as Iran.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-safavids-consolidate-power>How did the Safavids consolidate power?</h2>
<p>God has come. Subsequent Safavid leaders continued to fuse Shiism with their political power. They built mosques and appointed prayer leaders in each village to secure Shia beliefs. The Safavids made their empire a safe haven for Shi’a scholars and invited many of them to migrate to their empire.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-europeans-adopt-it-more-readily-than-most-peoples-and-why-were-they-so-intent-on-improving-it>Why did Europeans adopt it more readily than most peoples and why were they so intent on improving it?</h2>
<p>Why did Europeans adopt new military technology more readily than most other peoples and why were they so intent on improving it? In Europe, rival states wanted the latest weaponry, or even better, something new that would give them decisive advantages over their rivals.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-culture-did-the-safavids-have>What kind of culture did the Safavids have?</h2>
<p>The Safavid family was a literate family from its early origin. There are extant Tati and Persian poetry from Shaykh Safi ad-din Ardabili as well as extant Persian poetry from Shaykh Sadr ad-din. Most of the extant poetry of Shah Ismail I is in Azerbaijani pen-name of Khatai.</p>

<h2 id=where-did-the-safavid-family-live-in-azerbaijan>Where did the Safavid family live in Azerbaijan?</h2>
<p>It is probable that the family originated in Persian Kurdistan, and later moved to Azerbaijan, where they adopted the Azari form of Turkish spoken there, and eventually settled in the small town of Ardabil sometimes during the eleventh century.</p>
