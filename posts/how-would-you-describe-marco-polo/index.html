<h2 id=how-would-you-describe-marco-polo>How would you describe Marco Polo?</h2>
<p>Marco Polo (1254-1324) was a Venetian merchant believed to have journeyed across Asia at the height of the Mongol Empire. Upon reaching China, Marco Polo entered the court of powerful Mongol ruler Kublai Khan, who dispatched him on trips to help administer the realm. Marco Polo remained abroad for 24 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-marco-polo-describe-the-gobi-desert>How did Marco Polo describe the Gobi Desert?</h2>
<p>Part four: The Gobi Desert Marco Polo writes about how this desert…“is reported to be so long that it would take a year to go from end to end; and at the narrowest point it takes a month to cross it. It consists entirely of mountains and sands and valleys. There is nothing at all to eat.”</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-idea-of-marco-polo>What is the main idea of Marco Polo?</h2>
<p>From a historical point of view, the message seemed to be one of self- glorification and spiking the age of exploration that ended up defining much of world history. Polo’s writing reflects the interest in the exploration of “the Orient” and the areas that were not located in Europe.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-author-of-the-travels-of-marco-polo>Who was the author of the travels of Marco Polo?</h2>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Marco Polo was captured in battle by Venice’s archrival Genoa. While in prison he met the Arthurian adventure writer Rustichello of Pisa, with whom he would collaborate on a 1298 manuscript called “Description of the World.” It has since become better known as “The Travels of Marco Polo” or simply “The Travels.”</p>
<h2 id=when-was-marco-polo-born-and-when-did-he-die>When was Marco Polo born and when did he die?</h2>
<p>Written By: Marco Polo, (born c. 1254, Venice [Italy]—died January 8, 1324, Venice), Venetian merchant and adventurer who traveled from Europe to Asia in 1271–95, remaining in China for 17 of those years, and whose Il milione (“The Million”), known in English as the Travels of Marco Polo, is a classic of travel literature.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-years-did-marco-polo-spend-in-china>How many years did Marco Polo spend in China?</h2>
<p>Polo, Marco. Marco Polo’s travels to Asia (1271–95), immortalized in his Travels of Marco Polo. Marco, his father, and his uncle set out from Venice in 1271 and reached China in 1275. The Polos spent a total of 17 years in China. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. The family appears to have been shrewd, alert, and courageous;</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-marco-polos-il-milione>What was the impact of Marco Polo’s Il Milione?</h2>
<p>Marco Polo’s account in Il milione opened new vistas to the European mind, and, as Western horizons expanded, Polo’s legacy grew as well. The wealth of new geographic information recorded by Polo was widely used in the late 15th and the 16th centuries, during the age of the great European voyages of discovery and conquest.</p>
