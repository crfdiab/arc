<h2 id=how-do-people-in-spain-depend-on-the-environment>How do people in Spain depend on the environment?</h2>
<p>The Spaniards depend on their environment because many of them make a living off of the land by growing various crops and vegetation. Some fruit that grow in Spain and are popular are oranges and lemons. A larger amount of harvest are exported to other countries.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-permanently-live-in-spain>How can I permanently live in Spain?</h2>
<p>Individuals can obtain permanent residency in Spain after having legally lived in the country for a period of five uninterrupted years. When they fulfill this specific condition, they can apply for permanent residency and then gain the right to live for the rest of their lives in the country.</p>
<h2 id=is-spain-a-good-country-to-move-to>Is Spain a good country to move to?</h2>
<p>Spain ranks as the best place in Europe for expats wanting to enjoy life, and second overall, just behind New Zealand. “Rather than living mostly in the expat bubble, experience-hungry expats look for the local culture following their move to the country,” according to the survey.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-live-in-spain-without-working>Can I live in Spain without working?</h2>
<p>The quickest way into Spain is through a Short-Stay Visa (visado do corta duracion), also known as a travel visa. This allows foreign nationals from outside the EU to visit Spain, without working in the country, for up to 90 days within a 180-day span.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-people-in-spain-adapted-to-their-environment>How are the people in Spain adapted to their environment?</h2>
<p>People in Spain adapted to their environment by forming their culture on the aspects of the region’s natural environment. For instance, the traditional clothing of local Spanish populations is quite light due to the warm climate.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-life-like-in-spain-as-a-foreigner>What’s the life like in Spain as a foreigner?</h2>
<p>People in Spain work to live – they don’t live to work. In general, Spaniards are friendly with a relaxed way of life, making it very easy to feel comfortable. And if you have a family, you’ll love the child-friendly environment.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-the-people-of-spain-live-in-europe>Where do the people of Spain live in Europe?</h2>
<p>The people of Spain live in a country encompassing 85 percent of the Iberian Peninsula, itself lying on the southwestern tip of Europe. The Atlantic Ocean, the Pyrenees Mountains, the Strait of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean Sea, and Portugal form its boundaries.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-live-in-spain>What’s the best way to live in Spain?</h2>
<p>1. Lines are long. Not only are the lines long, but no one ever seems to be in a rush. If you come from a fast-paced environment, this can be infuriating. Our best advice is to plan ahead and go with the flow. If you want to live in Spain, you should try to assimilate to the laid-back lifestyle.</p>
