<h2 id=where-is-the-marine-west-coast-climate-found-in-europe>Where is the marine west coast climate found in Europe?</h2>
<p>It is located poleward of the Mediterranean climate region on the western sides of the continents, between 35° and 60° N and S latitude.</p>
<h2 id=what-locations-experience-marine-west-coast-climates>What locations experience marine west coast climates?</h2>
<p>The marine west coast climate, a type of mild climate typical of cities such as Seattle, Washington, in the U.S. and Wellington, New Zealand, has a longer, cooler winter than the Mediterranean climate. Drizzle falls about two-thirds of winter days, and temperatures average about 5° Celsius (41° Fahrenheit).</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-majority-of-marine-west-coast-climate-located>Where was the majority of marine west coast climate located?</h2>
<p>The marine west coast climate is a biome characteristic of being located mid-way between the tropics and arctic or antarctic regions of the world, most often between 35 and 60 degrees north.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-west-coast-have-4-seasons>Does the West coast have 4 seasons?</h2>
<p>All Four Seasons in California WINTER (the wet season) and SUMMER (the dry, hot season) which may also be known as Fire Season (as in wildfires).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-marine-west-coast-climate-and-a-mediterranean-climate>What is the difference between a marine west coast climate and a Mediterranean climate?</h2>
<p>The ocean keeps the air over the land cool in summer and warm in the winter. This creates a mild, but wet climate. This climate is similar to a Mediterranean climate because of the influence of ocean currents, but they are greatly different in the level of precipitation.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-no-humidity-on-the-west-coast>Why is there no humidity on the West Coast?</h2>
<p>The West coast has low humidity because of the cold northern current running just offshore. The warmish air from the interior of the Pacific Ocean flows eastward over the narrow strip of cold water flowing south along the west coast, cooling the air and precipitating the excess moisture out in the form of fog.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-european-country-has-a-marine-climate>Which is European country has a marine climate?</h2>
<p>In Northeast Europe, there are marine west coast climates. Marine climates is made with warm summers and cool winters with a small array of yearly temperatures. In short, Mediterranean climates have warm to hot and dry summers, alternatively mild and wet winters. Some of the places that have this kind of climates are seen in Northwestern Europe.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-marine-west-coast-climate-located>Where is the marine west coast climate located?</h2>
<p>For example, wher­ever the coast is paralleled by mountain ranges, this climate is found in a very narrow coastal belt e.g., marine west coast climate is confined to the coastal strips along the western coasts of North and South Americas because of Rockies and Andes.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-climate-does-west-european-have>What kind of climate does West European have?</h2>
<p>Marine coast climate or West European type of climate is basically humid climate and is characterized by abundant and uniformly distributed precipitation throughout the year but winter maximum is the charac­teristic feature of coastal locations while interior loca­tions record summer maximum.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-marine-influences-found-in-western-europe>Where are marine influences found in Western Europe?</h2>
<p>On the other hand, wherever relief barrier does not exist, marine influences reach far inland e.g., north-western Europe.</p>
