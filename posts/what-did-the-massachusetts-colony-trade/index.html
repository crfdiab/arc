<h2 id=what-did-the-massachusetts-colony-trade>What did the Massachusetts Colony trade?</h2>
<p>The sawmills, shipyards, tanneries and warehouses played a prominent role in the colony. Trade in the Massachusetts Colony used the natural resources and raw materials available to develop trade in fish, timber, furs, wool, leather, whale products, ships and livestock.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-massachusetts-bay-colony-export>What did the Massachusetts Bay Colony export?</h2>
<p>Massachusetts Bay Colony Economy: By the mid-18th century, Massachusetts Bay Colony had grown into a successful colony with a large trade industry that exported fish, lumber and farm products to Europe.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-massachusetts-bay-colony-import>What did the Massachusetts Bay Colony import?</h2>
<p>The Massachusetts Bay Colony became the first English chartered colony whose board of governors did not reside in England. This independence helped the settlers to maintain their Puritan religious practices without interference from the king, Archbishop Laud, or the Anglican Church.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-massachusetts-bay-colony-make-money>How did the Massachusetts Bay Colony make money?</h2>
<p>The Massachusetts Bay Colony primarily made money through shipbuilding, fishing, fur, and lumber production.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-trade-did-the-massachusetts-bay-colony-have>What kind of trade did the Massachusetts Bay Colony have?</h2>
<p>Certain businesses, notably shipbuilding, fisheries, and the fur and lumber trades, quickly got started. As early as 1632 ships built in the colony began trading, either with other colonies, England, or foreign ports in Europe.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-massachusetts-bay-company-established-in-new-england>When was the Massachusetts Bay Company established in New England?</h2>
<p>Massachusetts Bay Company, English chartered company that established the Massachusetts Bay colony in New England. Organized (1628) as the New England Company, it took over the Dorchester Company, which had established a short-lived fishing colony on Cape Ann in 1623.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-slavery-affect-the-massachusetts-bay-colony>How did slavery affect the Massachusetts Bay Colony?</h2>
<p>Slavery also played an important role in the Massachusetts Bay Colony’s economy. Starting in 1644, Boston merchants began to engage in the Triangle Trade, a three-stop trade route in which merchants imported slaves from Africa, sold them in the West Indies and then bought cane sugar to bring back to Massachusetts to make molasses and rum.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-massachusetts-bay-company-benefit-from-the-english-civil-war>How did the Massachusetts Bay Company benefit from the English Civil War?</h2>
<p>The outbreak of the English Civil War in 1641 further shielded the Massachusetts Bay Company, especially when Oliver Cromwell (1599–1658) and the Puritan Independents emerged victorious. Massachusetts now had a friendly government in England that would protect its religious and civil polity.</p>
