<p>The 13th Amendment was necessary because the Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln in January of 1863, did not end slavery entirely; those ensllaved in border states had not been freed. In addition to banning slavery, the amendment outlawed the practice of involuntary servitude and peonage.</p>

<p>Slavery amendment is an amendment to the U.S. constitution that formally abolished slavery system in the U.S. This clause still continues to prohibit slavery and involuntary servitude except as a punishment for a crime.

<h2 id=how-did-the-fifth-amendment-affect-the-abolition-of-slavery>How did the Fifth Amendment affect the abolition of slavery?</h2>
<p>Although abolitionists used the Fifth Amendment to argue against slavery, it became part of the legal basis in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) for treating slaves as property.
