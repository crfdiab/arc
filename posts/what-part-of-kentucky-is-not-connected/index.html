<p>The mailing address of the area is Tiptonville, Tennessee. New Madrid, Missouri, is directly across the river to the north, but it is not connected to the bend by road or ferry….</p>
<table><tr><th>Kentucky Bend</th></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Population</td></tr><tr><td>• Total</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>ZIP code</td><td>38079</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-branches-of-government-in-kentucky>What are the three branches of government in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Kentucky state government is made up of three branches. Executive, Judicial and Legislative.</p>
<h2 id=what-states-connect-to-kentucky>What states connect to Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Kentucky borders seven states, from the Midwest and the Southeast. West Virginia lies to the east, Virginia to the southeast, Tennessee to the south, Missouri to the west, Illinois and Indiana to the northwest, and Ohio to the north and northeast.</p>
<h2 id=is-tennessee-above-or-below-kentucky>Is Tennessee above or below Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Kentucky is centralized between seven states. To the north lies Oho, Indiana, and Illinois. Virginia, and West Virginia border Kentucky in east, and Tennessee is to the south.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-branches-of-government-does-kentucky-have>How many branches of government does Kentucky have?</h2>
<p>This is the current constitution for Kentucky, a document older than six American states. Kentucky’s state constitution divides the powers of government into three separate branches, a tactic employed by all the states that preceded it, as well as the federal government.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-kentucky-become-part-of-the-union>When did Kentucky become part of the Union?</h2>
<p>The Commonwealth of Kentucky was the 15th state admitted into the Union. It was admitted in 1792 after being parceled off from Virginia. Kentucky has had four constitutions in its state history, with the current one dating back to 1891.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-northern-border-of-the-state-of-kentucky>What is the northern border of the state of Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Kentucky’s northern border is formed by the Ohio River and its western border by the Mississippi River. The official state borders are based on the courses of the rivers as they existed when Kentucky became a state in 1792 but some parts of the river have deviated since then.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-state-government-of-kentucky-meet>Where does the state government of Kentucky meet?</h2>
<p>The government of Kentucky meets in the State Capitol Building in Frankfort. Since the timing of elections matters in Kentucky, let’s examine how the legislature is elected. Senators are directly elected by the people to four-year terms. However, elections are stacked so that there is an election every two years.</p>
