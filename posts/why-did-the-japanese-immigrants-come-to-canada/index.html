<h2 id=why-did-the-japanese-immigrants-come-to-canada>Why did the Japanese immigrants come to Canada?</h2>
<p>Following Manzo Nagano’s immigration to Canada, the first wave (Issei) of Japanese immigrants flowed into Canada, looking for opportunities. Primarily young men, these immigrants settled in “Japantowns” (the suburbs of Vancouver and Victoria) and fishing villages in Fraser Valley to work in mills and mines.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-japanese-immigrate-from>Where did the Japanese immigrate from?</h2>
<p>Japanese immigrants arrived first on the Hawaiian Islands in the 1860s, to work in the sugarcane fields. Many moved to the U.S. mainland and settled in California, Oregon, and Washington, where they worked primarily as farmers and fishermen.</p>
<h2 id=what-challenges-did-japanese-immigrants-face-in-canada>What challenges did Japanese immigrants face in Canada?</h2>
<p>Japanese Canadians, both Issei immigrants and their Canadian-born children, called Nisei (second generation), have faced prejudice and discrimination. Beginning in 1874, BC politicians pandered to White supremacists and passed a series of laws intended to force all Asians to leave Canada.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-japanese-canadians-settle-in-canada>Where did the Japanese Canadians settle in Canada?</h2>
<p>Japanese Canadians have settled primarily in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, and have contributed to every aspect of Canadian society.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-japanese-immigrants-are-there-in-canada>How many Japanese immigrants are there in Canada?</h2>
<p>The 2016 census recorded 45,060 first generation Japanese Canadians (Japanese immigrants); 37,615 second generation (children of Japanese immigrants) and 38,810 third generation and more Japanese Canadians.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-most-of-the-japanese-immigrants-come-from>Where did most of the Japanese immigrants come from?</h2>
<p>Most of the issei (first generation or immigrants) arrived during the first decade of the 20th century. They came from fishing villages and farms in Japan and settled in Vancouver, Victoria and in the surrounding towns.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-japanese-immigrants-come-to-british-columbia>When did Japanese immigrants come to British Columbia?</h2>
<p>The situation was exacerbated when, in 1907, the United States began prohibiting Japanese immigrants from accessing mainland America through Hawaii, resulting in a massive influx (over 7,000 as compared to 2,042 in 1906) of Japanese immigrants into British Columbia.</p>
