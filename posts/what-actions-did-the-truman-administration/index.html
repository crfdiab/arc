<h2 id=what-actions-did-the-truman-administration>What actions did the Truman administration?</h2>
<p>Truman becomes the thirty-third President of the United States. Germany surrenders, ending World War II in Europe. Representatives from the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union attend the Potsdam Conference. The United States drops an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-truman-deal-with-communism>How did Truman deal with communism?</h2>
<p>The president adopted a policy of containment toward Soviet expansion and the spread of communism. In 1947, he introduced the Truman Doctrine to provide aid to Greece and Turkey in an effort to protect them from communist aggression.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-us-intervene-to-stop-communism>Where did the US intervene to stop communism?</h2>
<p>After Cold War The end of the Cold War in 1991 marked the official end of the containment policy, but the U.S. kept its bases in the areas around Russia, such as those in Iceland, Germany, and Turkey.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-truman-to-lose-some-of-his-support-in-the-south>What caused Truman to lose some of his support in the South?</h2>
<p>His candidacy collapsed when the liberal Americans for Democratic Action and the Congress of Industrial Organizations withheld their support, partly due to concerns over Pepper’s attacks on Truman’s foreign policy decisions regarding the Soviet Union.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-truman-administration-take-to-try-to-identify>What was the Truman administration take to try to identify?</h2>
<p>Truman issued what would become known as the Truman Doctrine: a promise that the United States would do whatever was necessary both economically and militarily to contain the spread of communism around the world. Painting of Harry S. Truman during his time in office.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-truman-do-for-the-economy>What did Truman do for the economy?</h2>
<p>Truman’s economic policy sought to balance the federal budget through a combination of high taxes and limited spending; any budget surplus would be applied to the national debt. As the economy stalled, Truman in mid-1949 abandoned his hope for a balanced budget and gave some tax breaks to businesses.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-contain-communism>How did the US contain communism?</h2>
<p>The United Stated had to contain communism from spreading through out Berlin, Korea, and Cuba. The United States contained communism by airlifting supplies to Berlin, sending troops to Korea, and set up a blockade/quarantine to keep out the communist Soviet Union.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-containment-of-communism>Who was involved in the containment of communism?</h2>
<p>Containment. In 1946, American diplomat George Kennan, who was minister-counselor and chargé d’affaires at the American Embassy in Moscow, suggested that the United States could hold Communism at its 1945 boundaries with what he described as a patient and long-term “containment” of the Soviet system.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-halt-the-spread-of-communism-into-greece>How did the US halt the spread of communism into Greece?</h2>
<p>If the United States wanted to halt the spread of Communism into Greece, it would have to do so itself. Halting the spread of Communism had become the United States’ basic foreign policy.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-at-the-beginning-of-the-cold-war>Who was president at the beginning of the Cold War?</h2>
<p>Conclusion: Truman and the Beginning of the Cold War. With President Truman adopting an explicit attitude of anti-Soviet policy with his Truman Plan, historic tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union erupted into what is known as the Cold War.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-us-foreign-policy-during-the-cold-war>What was the US foreign policy during the Cold War?</h2>
<p>Truman Doctrine: An American foreign policy created to counter Soviet geopolitical spread during the Cold War, first announced to Congress by President Harry S. Truman on March 12, 1947. NATO: An intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty, signed on 4 April 1949.</p>
