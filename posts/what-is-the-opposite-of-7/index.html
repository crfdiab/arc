<h2 id=what-is-the-opposite-of-7>What is the opposite of 7?</h2>
<p>The opposite of 7 is -7.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-opposite-of-negative-8>What is the opposite of negative 8?</h2>
<p>Explanation: Opposite of a number means its additive inverse, which means the number added to its additive inverse would be zero. Thus opposite of 8 is -8.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-opposite-of-5>What is the opposite of 5?</h2>
<p>-5<br>
The opposite of 5 is -5.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-opposite-of-negative-4>What is the opposite of negative 4?</h2>
<p>The first type of opposite is the one you might be most familiar with: positive numbers and negative numbers. For example, the opposite of 4 is -4, or negative four. On a number line, 4 and -4 are both the same distance from 0, but they’re on opposite sides. This type of opposite is also called the additive inverse.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-reciprocal-of-7>What is a reciprocal of 7?</h2>
<p>The reciprocal of 7 is 1/7. In general, the reciprocal of a fraction simply interchanges the numerator and denominator of the fraction.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-opposite-of-0>What’s the opposite of 0?</h2>
<p>negative zero<br>
The opposite of zero is negative zero.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-opposite-of-8>What is the opposite of +8?</h2>
<p>The opposite reciprocal of 8 would be -1/8.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-reciprocals-of-5>What are the reciprocals of 5?</h2>
<p>The reciprocal of 5 is 1/5.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-reciprocal-of-13>What is a reciprocal of 13?</h2>
<p>3<br>
Likewise the reciprocal of 13 is 3 and so on.</p>
<h2 id=is-0-an-even-number>Is 0 an even number?</h2>
<p>For mathematicians the answer is easy: zero is an even number. Because any number that can be divided by two to create another whole number is even.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-the-opposite-of-i>Which is an example of the opposite of I?</h2>
<p>What is the opposite of I? Opposite of the speaker or writer referred to as the subject “I ask of you that you honor your family.” “ Nay, captain, it is nigh on impossible to do as you command.” Opposite of the set of qualities that makes a person, a group of people, or a thing different from others</p>
<h2 id=is-there-such-a-thing-as-the-opposite-of-a-number>Is there such a thing as the opposite of a number?</h2>
<p>The opposite of a number is a number that is the same distance from 0 as another number, but in the opposite direction. Given a number, the opposite of that number can also be thought of as the number that needs to be added in order for the result to be 0. The number line above shows that positive three and negative three are opposites …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-opposite-of-opposite-in-order>What is the opposite of opposite in order?</h2>
<p>Opposite of opposite or contrary in position, direction, order, or effect. ( of two or more things) Opposite of contrasting or conflicting with each other. Opposite of turned around. Opposite of more distant in space than another item of the same kind.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-opposite-of-3--4--2>Which is the opposite of 3 + 4 + 2?</h2>
<p>The opposite of (3 + 4 + 2) is -9. The opposite of a number is also referred to as its additive inverse, a concept that is also used in algebra to apply to variables and other expressions, not just positive and negative numbers. In an algebraic context, finding the additive inverse involves multiplying a given expression by -1.</p>
