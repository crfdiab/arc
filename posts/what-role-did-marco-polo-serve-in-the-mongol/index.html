<h2 id=what-role-did-marco-polo-serve-in-the-mongol>What role did Marco Polo serve in the Mongol?</h2>
<p>Marco Polo (1254-1324) was a Venetian merchant believed to have journeyed across Asia at the height of the Mongol Empire. Upon reaching China, Marco Polo entered the court of powerful Mongol ruler Kublai Khan, who dispatched him on trips to help administer the realm. Marco Polo remained abroad for 24 years.</p>
<h2 id=was-marco-polo-in-mongolia>Was Marco Polo in Mongolia?</h2>
<p>Venetian explorer Marco Polo spent more than two decades in the service of Kublai Khan, one of the greatest rulers in history who reigned over Mongolia for 34 years. Polo traveled extensively with his family, journeying from Europe to Asia from 1271 to 1295 and remaining in China for 17 of those years.</p>

<p>Marco Polo provided military tactics to Genghis Khan. d. Marco Polo worked as a court administrator for 17 years.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-kublai-khan-and-what-did-he-do>Who is Kublai Khan and what did he do?</h2>
<p>Kublai Khan was the fifth emperor (reigned 1260–94) of the Yuan (Mongol) dynasty (1206–1368). He conquered China in 1279, becoming the first Yuan ruler of all of China. He was partially responsible for the development of “dual principle” political theory. As ruler, he made paper money the sole medium of exchange.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-mongol-ruler-that-marco-polo-met>Who was the Mongol ruler that Marco Polo met?</h2>
<p>According to The Travels of Marco Polo, they passed through much of Asia, and met with Kublai Khan, a Mongol ruler and founder of the Yuan dynasty. Their decision to leave Constantinople proved timely. In 1261 Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, took Constantinople,…</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-marco-polo-when-he-went-to-china>How old was Marco Polo when he went to China?</h2>
<p>Marco Polo. He first set out at age 17 with his father and uncle, traveling overland along what later became known as the Silk Road. Upon reaching China, Marco Polo entered the court of powerful Mongol ruler Kublai Khan, who dispatched him on trips to help administer the realm. Marco Polo remained abroad for 24 years.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-marco-polo-go-back-to-the-venetians>Why did Marco Polo go back to the Venetians?</h2>
<p>He also told partially erroneous self-aggrandizing tales about warfare, commerce, geography, court intrigues and the sexual practices of the people who lived under Mongol rule. A Genoese-Venetian peace treaty in 1299 allowed Marco Polo to return home. He probably never left Venetian territory again.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-marco-polo-when-he-met-kublai-khan>How old was Marco Polo when he met Kublai Khan?</h2>
<p>Marco Polo would have been a teenager at the time, finally reaching Kublai’s court when he was around 20 years old. For the next 17 years, Marco Polo lived in China with his father and uncle. We really don’t know everything that happened during this time, but Kublai seems to have taken a deep interest in young Marco.</p>
