<h2 id=what-policies-did-george-w-bush-make>What policies did George W Bush make?</h2>
<p>Some of George W. Bush’s biggest domestic policy achievements include winning passage for two major tax cuts during his term in office: the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.</p>
<h2 id=did-george-w-bush-start-a-war>Did George W Bush start a war?</h2>
<p>In October 2002, Congress granted President Bush the power to decide whether to launch any military attack in Iraq. The Iraq War began on 20 March 2003, when the US, joined by the UK, Australia, and Poland launched a “shock and awe” bombing campaign.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-the-environmental-policy-accomplishments-of-george-w-bush>How do the environmental policy accomplishments of George W Bush?</h2>
<p>The president listed what he sees as environmental accomplishments during his administration. 1. “Since 2001, air pollution has dropped by 12%. The strictest air quality standards in American history are now in place – as are strong regulations on power plant and diesel engine emissions.”</p>
<h2 id=why-did-president-bush-send-troops-to-iraq>Why did President Bush send troops to Iraq?</h2>
<p>The 2003 invasion of Iraq was the first stage of the Iraq War. According to U.S. President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the coalition aimed “to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein’s support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people.”</p>
<h2 id=what-did-george-w-bush-do-for-the-economy>What did George W Bush do for the economy?</h2>
<p>Bush administration was characterized by significant income tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, the implementation of Medicare Part D in 2003, increased military spending for two wars, a housing bubble that contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–2008, and the Great Recession that followed.</p>
<h2 id=who-opposed-bushs-environmental-policies>Who opposed Bush’s environmental policies?</h2>
<p>56% nationwide oppose the Bush decision, along with 60% of Californians, 53% of Oregonians, and 56% of Washington state. In the Mountain States, 45% support Bush’s decision vs. 43% who oppose, and in Alaska it is 43% support to 48% oppose.</p>
