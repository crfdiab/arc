<h2 id=what-is-the-reason-for-preheating>What is the reason for preheating?</h2>
<p>The process of preheating involves heating the area around the weld joint or the entire part to a specified temperature before welding. This reduces the cooling rate of the weld and drives out moisture, which in turn helps prevent hydrogen buildup and the potential for cracking.</p>
<h2 id=which-type-of-heating-you-will-use-for-preheating-of-plastic-compound>Which type of heating you will use for preheating of plastic compound?</h2>
<p>Preheating of Plastic Preforms: Dielectric heating is the only method which can be used for preheating of plastic preforms to proper temperature uniformly.</p>
<h2 id=which-one-of-the-plastic-material-requires-preheating-before-processing>Which one of the plastic material requires preheating before processing?</h2>
<p>1 Preheating temperature. Preheating temperature has a significant effect on the sintering deformation of nylon, and is the key to the implementation of SLS forming. When preheating temperature is too low or there is no preheating, higher laser power will be required to melt nylon powder.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-billets-used-in-the-extrusion-process-in-some-cases-need-to-be-preheated>Why do billets used in the extrusion process in some cases need to be preheated?</h2>
<p>With increasing billet preheating temperature, the high-temperature range in the cavity gradually increases, the temperature at the die exit gradually increases. A large amount of deformation heat is generated and released at the die exit because of large extrusion ratio.</p>
<h2 id=why-preheating-is-necessary-in-welding>Why preheating is necessary in welding?</h2>
<p>Why Is Preheating Important? Preheating minimizes the temperature difference between the welding arc and the base material. Second, proper preheating helps to slow the cooling rate of the finished weld and reduce hardness in the heat-affected zone (HAZ), which creates a weld that is less brittle and more ductile.</p>
<h2 id=what-temperature-is-a-preheated-oven>What temperature is a preheated oven?</h2>
<p>350˚F<br>
Hang an oven thermometer in the center of the middle rack and preheat the oven to 350˚F (176.67˚C). Allow the oven to preheat for at least 20 minutes and take a temperature reading. This will tell you if the oven is even reaching the desired temperature from the beginning.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-of-electric-heating>What are the advantages of electric heating?</h2>
<p>Advantages of Electric Heating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Economical: Electric heating is economical as electric furnaces are cheaper in initial cost as well as maintenance cost.</li>
<li>Cleanliness:</li>
<li>Absence of Flue Gases:</li>
<li>Ease of Control:</li>
<li>Automatic Protection:</li>
<li>Upper Limit of Temperature:</li>
<li>Special Heating Requirements:</li>
<li>High Efficiency of Utilization:</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-does-pe-plastic-stand-for>What does PE plastic stand for?</h2>
<p>Polyethylene<br>
Polyethylene or polythene (abbreviated PE; IUPAC name polyethene or poly(methylene)) is the most common plastic in use today. It is a polymer, primarily used for packaging (plastic bags, plastic films, geomembranes and containers including bottles, etc.).</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-remove-moisture-from-plastic>How do you remove moisture from plastic?</h2>
<ol>
<li>1 Dehumidifying Dryers. Dehumidifying Dryers are designed to eliminate moisture in the plastic material before processing.</li>
<li>2 Rotary Wheel Dryers.</li>
<li>3 Low Pressure Dryers or Vacuum Dryers.</li>
<li>4 Compressed Air Dryers.</li>
<li>5 Hot Air Dryers.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=which-extrusion-is-mostly-used>Which extrusion is mostly used?</h2>
<p>Aluminium is the most commonly extruded material. Aluminium can be hot or cold extruded. If it is hot extruded it is heated to 575 to 1100 °F (300 to 600 °C).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-extrusion-defects>What are the extrusion defects?</h2>
<p>The common defects in extrusion process are: Improper System Engineering/Installation, Improper Operation, Resin Defects, Improper Materials Addition, Surging, Poor mixing, Melt toughness or fracture, Overheating, Moisture release, Trapped air, Contamination.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-dry-plastic-pellets>Why is it important to dry plastic pellets?</h2>
<p>Proper drying Improves processing consistency by removing moisture from the pellet prior to processing and preheating the material to predetermined temperature. The drying specifications outline three criteria; how ‘dry’ the air must be: how high the air temperature must be; and how long the resin must be dried. Dry Air</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-increase-output-with-preheated-pellets>Is it possible to increase output with preheated pellets?</h2>
<p>1. Yes it’s possible to increase the extruder output (plus other benefits) by preheating the pellets — without changing the screws. 2. After making some trial runs on the existing screw, it may be very possible to in crease output with preheated pellets by altering the existing screw. 3.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-pellets-used-in-injection-molding>What happens to pellets used in injection molding?</h2>
<p>Since these pellets would have absorbed the moisture in the atmosphere, if they are used for injection molding while they still contain a lot of moisture, depending on the type of material, they can undergo hydrolysis, or their physical properties can decrease.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-pelletizing>What do you need to know about pelletizing?</h2>
<p>Sufficient moisture needs to be added to make the ore sticky enough to pelletize, but not so much moisture that the ore becomes “muddy.” A binder is required to hold the particle grains together before, when, and after the pellet is dried.</p>
