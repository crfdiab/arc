<h2 id=what-happens-as-water-vapor-cools-and-rises>What happens as water vapor cools and rises?</h2>
<p>Because air is cooler at higher altitude in the troposphere, water vapor cools as it rises high in the atmosphere and transforms into water droplets by a process called condensation. The water droplets that form make up clouds. If the temperature is cold enough, ice crystals form instead of liquid water droplets.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-water-vapor-condenses-into-dew>What happens when water vapor condenses into dew?</h2>
<p>Condensation is the change of water from gas form to liquid form. When water vapor in the atmosphere loses heat and cools down, condensation happens. As the water vapor cools down and condenses, it attaches to small particles of dust floating in the atmosphere, forming tiny liquid water droplets.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-three-things-that-can-happen-to-water-when-it-falls-on-earths-surface>What are three things that can happen to water when it falls on Earth’s surface?</h2>
<p>Describe three things that can happen to water when it falls on Earth’s surface. The water can evaporate immediately. It can run off into rivers and lakes and into oceans. Some water soaks into the ground and becomes groundwater.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-water-vapor-when-it-cools>What happens to water vapor when it cools?</h2>
<p>When water vapor cools, it condenses. It is a phase change where water changes from a gas to a liquid. Condensation is the opposite of evaporation. In the atmosphere, moisture condenses to form clouds at higher levels. When it condenses near the surface, fog forms.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-rate-of-condensation-determined-by-the-dew-point>Is the rate of condensation determined by the dew point?</h2>
<p>The point at which air becomes cool enough that water vapor begins to condense out is indeed the dew point temperature, but, says Govindan, “In order to determine the rate of condensation, all sorts of things must be understood about a region—its geography, climate conditions, air flows, and so on. It is not decided by the dew point.”</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-air-reaches-the-dew-point>What happens when air reaches the dew point?</h2>
<p>Wet-bulb temperature eventually rises to converge with the dry-bulb temperature, the air temperature as measured by a thermometer completely shielded from moisture. Read more.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-condensation-rate-as-air-cools>What happens to the condensation rate as air cools?</h2>
<p>As air is cooled, the evaporation rate decreases more rapidly than does the condensation rate with the result that there comes a temperature (the dew point temperature) where the evaporation is less than the condensation and a droplet can grow into a cloud drop.</p>
