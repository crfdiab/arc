<h2 id=what-time-is-last-call-in-az>What time is last call in AZ?</h2>
<p>While ending last call at 2 a.m., the legislation would give patrons until 2:30 to finish their drinks. Arizona law currently prohibits the sale of liquor between 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. Monday through Saturday, and between 1 a.m. and 10 a.m. on Sundays. Thirty-seven states allow liquor sales after 1 a.m.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-before-close-is-last-call>How long before close is last call?</h2>
<p>Thirty minutes before closing, a loud, and usually obnoxious announcement is made that if you are thirsty for another beverage, that you better propel yourself towards the closest bartender to order one last (or possibly a few last) drinks before alcohol service suspends.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-buy-alcohol-after-2am-in-arizona>Can you buy alcohol after 2am in Arizona?</h2>
<p>Under current law, residents and visitors in Arizona can buy beer, wine and liquor every day beginning at 6 a.m. through 2 a.m. the following morning. But Sundays always have been different. At one time, there were no sales before noon.</p>
<h2 id=what-time-can-you-not-buy-alcohol-in-arizona>What time can you not buy alcohol in Arizona?</h2>
<p>Serving Hours During what hours may liquor be served? Liquor may not be sold at an on-sale or off-sale retail licensed premise between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.</p>
<h2 id=what-time-is-last-call-in-new-york>What time is last call in New York?</h2>
<p>The 4 a.m. time applies in New York City; clubs and bars may remain open without serving alcohol; they may start serving at 7 a.m. except on Sunday when sales begin at noon. Last call is also 4 a.m. in Saratoga Springs, Buffalo, and Albany.</p>
<h2 id=is-maine-still-a-dry-state>Is Maine still a dry state?</h2>
<p>Maine is an alcoholic beverage control state. The serving of alcohol in the State of Maine is supervised by the State Liquor and Lottery Commission. The Commission consists of five members appointed by the Governor of Maine and confirmed by the Maine Legislature.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-clubs-close-at-2am>Why do clubs close at 2am?</h2>
<p>It’s usually due to the state laws. Most bars around the world close around this time except the really touristy nightlife area like Las Vegas and New Orleans etc.. I think they don’t want people to drinking so late and causing problems. In my state the bars stay open all night long on New Years Eve.</p>
<h2 id=what-time-is-usually-last-call>What time is usually last call?</h2>
<p>2 a.m.<br>
California: 2 a.m. Colorado: 2 a.m. Delaware: Last call is 12:45 a.m. Service must stop at 1 a.m. All drinks must be removed from tables by 2 a.m. Service resumes at 9 a.m.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-drink-with-your-parents-in-new-york>Can you drink with your parents in New York?</h2>
<p>Persons under 21 are prohibited from purchasing alcohol or possessing alcohol with the intent to consume, unless the alcohol was given to that person by their parent or legal guardian. There is no law prohibiting persons under the age of 21 consuming alcohol that was given to them by their parent or legal guardian.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-last-call-in-every-state-in-america>What’s the last call in every state in America?</h2>
<p>Arizona: 2:30am. Arkansas: 1am (although some clubs close between 2am and 5am) California: 2am (larger cities may allow for later times) Colorado: 2am. Connecticut: 1am on weekdays, but 2am on …</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-warning-of-last-call-come>When does the warning of Last Call Come?</h2>
<p>Depending where you are in the United States, you may or may not be able to party all night and into the early morning hours. The ringing yell of a bartender warning of last call comes at 12 a.m. in some states, 4 a.m. in others, and never comes for bartenders in a few states.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-last-call-time-in-new-jersey>What’s the last call time in New Jersey?</h2>
<p>New Jersey: The state allows towns to regulate closing time on a local level. New York: 4am in NYC, but earlier (3am, usually) in smaller municipalities South Carolina: Varies on a town-by-town basis (but usually hovers somewhere around 2am)</p>
<h2 id=when-do-bars-have-last-call-in-every-state>When do bars have Last Call in every state?</h2>
<p>Mississippi: 12am, with some individual cities setting it at 1am or later Nevada: 24 hours a day! New Jersey: The state allows towns to regulate closing time on a local level. New York: 4am in NYC, but earlier (3am, usually) in smaller municipalities</p>
