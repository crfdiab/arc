<h2 id=is-claude-mckay-african-american>Is Claude McKay African American?</h2>
<p>Claude McKay, (born September 15, 1889, Nairne Castle, Jamaica, British West Indies—died May 22, 1948, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.), Jamaican-born poet and novelist whose Home to Harlem (1928) was the most popular novel written by an American black to that time.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-claude-mckay-urge-african-americans-to-do>What did Claude McKay urge African Americans to do?</h2>
<p>Claude McKay urged African Americans to stand up for their rights in his powerful verses. Jean Toomer wrote plays and short stories, as well as poems, to capture the spirit of his times. Book publishers soon took notice and patronized many of these talents.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-claude-mckay-impact-society>How did Claude McKay impact society?</h2>
<p>In addition to giving a voice to black immigrants, McKay was one of the first African-American poets of the Harlem Renaissance. As such, he influenced later poets, including Langston Hughes. He paved the way for black poets to discuss the conditions and racism that they faced in their poems.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-speaker-in-the-poem-if-we-must-die>Who is the speaker in the poem If we must die?</h2>
<p>“If We Must Die” is a poem about confronting oppression. The speaker addresses a group of oppressed people—a group that the speaker identifies with and seems to be part of. These people have been stripped of their dignity and their freedom and they are in despair, cornered by violent oppressors.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-poem-is-africa-by-claude-mckay>What kind of poem is Africa by Claude McKay?</h2>
<p>14 Of all the mighty nations of the sun. Keeping with Shakespearean literary tradition, Claude McKay’s “Africa” is an English sonnet relating the short but tragic life of a fallen heroine. The poem opens with a lengthy sentence of practically arranged clauses, the first of which states, “The sun sought thy dim bed and brought forth light” (line 1).</p>
<h2 id=what-does-dim-mean-in-claude-mckays-africa>What does dim mean in Claude McKay’s Africa?</h2>
<p>The adjective dim demonstrates Africa’s unlighted knowledge prior to God’s intervention and also connotes the dark complexions of Africa’s descendants, unspoken figures whose plight is a recurrent subject in McKay’s work.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-claude-mckay-say-about-new-peoples>What does Claude McKay say about new peoples?</h2>
<p>4 Thy slaves toiled at thy monumental best. 6 New peoples marvel at thy pyramids! 8 Watches the mad world with immobile lids. 9 The Hebrews humbled them at Pharaoh’s name. 10 Cradle of Power! Yet all things were in vain! 11 Honor and Glory, Arrogance and Fame! 12 They went. The darkness swallowed thee again. 14 Of all the mighty nations of the sun.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-author-of-the-poem-africa>Who is the author of the poem Africa?</h2>
<p>In this critical essay, student Heather Glover offers a concise rhetorical analysis of the sonnet “Africa” by Jamaican-American writer Claude McKay. McKay’s poem originally appeared in the collection Harlem Shadows (1922).</p>
