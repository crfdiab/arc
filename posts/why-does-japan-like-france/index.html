<h2 id=why-does-japan-like-france>Why does Japan like France?</h2>
<p>There are two main reasons for that. The first one is that Japanese people’s obsession with France, and especially Paris, is too extreme. These names often makes no sense at all, they just want something that sounds French. Needless to say, Japanese people associate anything French with luxury, class and refinement.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-france-and-japan>What is the relationship between France and Japan?</h2>
<p>France and Japan have enjoyed a very robust and progressive relationship spanning centuries through various contacts in each other’s countries by senior representatives, strategic efforts, and cultural exchanges.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-japan-invade-france>Why did Japan invade France?</h2>
<p>The main objective of the Japanese was to prevent China from importing arms and fuel through French Indochina along the Kunming–Hai Phong Railway, from the Indochinese port of Haiphong, through the capital of Hanoi to the Chinese city of Kunming in Yunnan.</p>
<h2 id=is-french-common-in-japan>Is French common in Japan?</h2>
<p>The French community in Japan has been steadily increasing, rising by more than 35% in the last decade. At the same time, the number of French tourists has nearly doubled to 150,000 per year. There are 4 bilingual schools, 60 cultural associations and over 700 companies in Japan.</p>
<h2 id=do-the-french-like-japan>Do the French like Japan?</h2>
<p>Yes we do. Even some anime are popular in France. But of course most important is French influence remains strong in Japan as economic cooperation.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-japan-and-france-in-the-19th-century>What is the relationship between Japan and France in the 19th century?</h2>
<p>Trade. As trade between the two countries developed, France became the first importer of Japanese silk, absorbing more than 50% of Japan’s raw silk production between 1865 and 1885. Silk remained the center of Franco-Japanese economic relations until the First World War.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-mutual-interest-between-japan-and-france>Is there mutual interest between Japan and France?</h2>
<p>There is a traditional mutual interest in Japan for French culture, which feeds the sustained success of the French luxury industries. A season of French culture will be organized in Japan in 2019.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-have-an-interest-in-japan>Why do people have an interest in Japan?</h2>
<p>Hentai, moe, etc. all the traditional Japanese culture stuff basically. They make entertainment products that I really enjoy and am thankful for. I don’t really have an inherent interest in the culture, but because of my consumption of those entertainment products of Japanese origin, I gained a slight interest through osmosis.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-japan-interested-in-the-european-union>Why is Japan interested in the European Union?</h2>
<p>For Paris as for Tokyo, it is also a question of highlighting the points of convergence between Japan and the European Union in opposition to the Chinese power, a “systemic rival” according to the European Commission, where the absolute control of the Party-state is increasing.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-season-of-french-culture-in-japan>Is there a season of French culture in Japan?</h2>
<p>A season of French culture will be organized in Japan in 2019. At the economic level, Tokyo’s signature of a free trade agreement with the European Union in 2018 confirms the considerable potential for trade development, particularly in the agri-food sector.</p>
