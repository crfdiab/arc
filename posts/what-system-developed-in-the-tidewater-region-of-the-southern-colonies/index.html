<h2 id=what-system-developed-in-the-tidewater-region-of-the-southern-colonies>What system developed in the Tidewater region of the southern colonies?</h2>
<p>The plantation system began in Virginia and Maryland when settlers began growing tobacco. The Tidewater region in South Carolina and Georgia was well suited for rice. However, rice-growing required many workers to labor in unpleasant conditions, and this was one reason rice-farming helped promote the spread of slavery.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-agriculture-is-in-virginia>What type of agriculture is in Virginia?</h2>
<p>Tobacco generates around 4% of total receipts. Other field crops grown in Virginia are hay, cotton, wheat, peanuts, and barley. Tomatoes and corn for grain are other major crops grown in Virginia. Other important vegetable crops grown in the state are potatoes, snap beans, cucumbers, and sweet corn.</p>

<h2 id=what-two-agricultural-products-are-grown-near-the-appalachian-mountains>What two agricultural products are grown near the Appalachian Mountains?</h2>
<p>A number of crops, such as tobacco, apples, tomatoes, and cabbage, are locally important in some valley areas, with small plots of tobacco being the most common cash crop in the southern Appalachians.

<h2 id=what-kind-of-agriculture-does-the-mediterranean-region-have>What kind of Agriculture does the Mediterranean region have?</h2>
<p>This is a highly capital-intensive type of farming and most of the crops are tree crops.

<h2 id=why-was-the-tidewater-region-of-england-founded>Why was the Tidewater region of England founded?</h2>
