<h2 id=why-did-louis-xiv-issue-the-edict-of-fontambleau>Why did Louis XIV issue the Edict of fontambleau?</h2>
<p>Louis’ issuing of the Edict of Fontambleau in 1685 was a culmination of things. Louis wanted religious unity in his Kingdom, and for him, it was necessary to drive out all religious minorities. He also probably wanted to appease the Catholic Church, whom he had fallen out of favor with.</p>
