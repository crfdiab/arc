<h2 id=what-is-the-only-amendment-that-can-be-repealed>What is the only amendment that can be repealed?</h2>
<p>The Eighteenth Amendment was repealed by the Twenty-first Amendment on December 5, 1933. It is the only amendment to be repealed.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-take-to-change-a-constitutional-amendment>What does it take to change a constitutional amendment?</h2>
<p>Article V of the Constitution provides two ways to propose amendments to the document. Amendments may be proposed either by the Congress, through a joint resolution passed by a two-thirds vote, or by a convention called by Congress in response to applications from two-thirds of the state legislatures.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-repeal-and-amendment>What is the difference between repeal and amendment?</h2>
<p>As nouns the difference between repeal and amendment is that repeal is an act or instance of repealing while amendment is an alteration or change for the better; correction of a fault or of faults; reformation of life by quitting vices.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-take-to-repeal-a-constitutional-amendment>What does it take to repeal a constitutional amendment?</h2>
<p>There are two ways to repeal an amendment. One way is for the proposed amendment to be passed by the House and the Senate with two-thirds majority votes.

<p>In the history of the United States, only one constitutional amendment has been repealed. In 1933, the 21st Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment—better known as “prohibition”—banning the manufacture and sale of alcohol in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-congress-is-needed-to-make-an-amendment>What percentage of Congress is needed to make an amendment?</h2>

<h2 id=how-many-amendments-to-the-us-constitution-have-been-repealed>How many amendments to the US Constitution have been repealed?</h2>
