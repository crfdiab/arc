<h2 id=why-go-bag-is-important>Why go bag is important?</h2>
<p>Go bags exist to save you from having to run around and gather items when a threatening situation is imminent. These bags are designed to provide everything a family of four needs to survive for several days after a disaster, especially if tried-and-trusted services aren’t available.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-pack-in-your-earthquake-survival-kit>What to pack in your earthquake survival kit?</h2>
<p>When an earthquake hits, there is no time to waste. Experts say you should have a survival kit ready to grab and go. Kurt Howard of the Los Angeles City Fire Department said “go-bags” should contain life’s essentials. Inside each bag should be medication, a change of clothes, a flashlight, portable radio, water and food .</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-pack-in-my-emergency-bag>What should I pack in my emergency bag?</h2>
<p>Pack food with a long expiry date like dried foods, biscuits or canned food. Foods with a high sugar content like dried raisins or sweets will provide you with extra energy. Also don’t forget to pack bottled water (best without minerals for a longer shelf life).</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-pack-in-my-go-bag>What should I pack in my go bag?</h2>
<p>Check your local listings here. Here’s what else to pack in your go bag to be prepared the next time an earthquake strikes and you need to leave your house ASAP: Bottled water (The Red Cross recommends one gallon per person, per day. A three-day supply for evacuation, two-week supply for home.)</p>
<h2 id=where-should-i-keep-my-earthquake-bag-in-my-home>Where should I Keep my earthquake bag in my home?</h2>
<p>Your home is where you spend the most time, so obviously you want to have an earthquake bag stored somewhere in your home. The best location is easily accessible, like a coat closet near the main door or under a bench in your entryway. Avoid putting it anywhere it could be buried.</p>
