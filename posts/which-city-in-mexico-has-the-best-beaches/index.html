<p>Cancun. Cancun’s beaches are some of the most popular in Mexico, recognized for their vast sands and clear blue waters.</p>
<h2 id=is-mexico-city-landlocked>Is Mexico City landlocked?</h2>
<p>Though Mexico City itself is landlocked, there are plenty of opportunities here to frolic in the water and swim at the beach. City officials created several artificial beaches for the public’s enjoyment back in 2008, and in addition, the lovely coastal areas of Acapulco and Costa Esmeralda aren’t far from the city.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-closest-beaches-to-mexico-city>Where are the closest beaches to Mexico City?</h2>
<p>The closest beaches to Mexico City are Acapulco which is the oppposite direction you are traveling and Veracruz. Both of which are about 4-5 hours by car so probably 6 hours by bus. So I would suggest going to Veracruz or further down to Tabasco state which further south on the gulf coast then on to Cancun.</p>

<h2 id=are-there-any-beaches-in-the-gulf-of-mexico>Are there any beaches in the Gulf of Mexico?</h2>
<p>Mexico is a country of amazing food, culture, and stunning ruins. It also features an extensive coastline and is home to some of the most amazing beaches in the world. There are nearly 500 beaches that span over the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of California, and the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-beaches-in-san-carlos-mexico>Where are the beaches in San Carlos Mexico?</h2>
<p>The city sits at the top of a giant cove, and the San Carlos coastline actually runs east and west, rather than north and south. In town, the 1.5 miles (2 kms) of beaches are mostly behind oceanfront homes and buildings. But as soon as you leave town heading down the coast, you’ll encounter over 3 miles (4.9 kms) of beautiful, uninterrupted beach.</p>
