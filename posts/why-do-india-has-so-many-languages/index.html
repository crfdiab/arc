<h2 id=why-do-india-has-so-many-languages>Why do India has so many languages?</h2>
<p>How did India achieve such linguistic diversity? Multiple Language Families: Route of mass human migrations from 60000 years (or older) and settlement from these migrations created multiple language families in India. We have 6-7 language families. Andamanese were probably the first existing people to migrate to India.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-india-have-two-official-languages>Why does India have two official languages?</h2>
<p>The Indian constitution does not specify the official languages to be used by the states for the conduct of their official functions and leaves each state free to, through its legislature, adopt Hindi or any language used in its territory as its official language or languages.</p>
<h2 id=does-india-have-multiple-official-languages>Does India have multiple official languages?</h2>
<p>The Indian constitution recognizes 22 official languages: Bengali, Hindi, Maithili, Nepalese, Sanskrit, Tamil, Urdu, Assamese, Dogri, Kannada, Gujarati, Bodo, Manipur (also known as Meitei), Oriya, Marathi, Santali, Telugu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Malayalam, Konkani and Kashmiri.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-official-languages-are-spoken-in-india>How many official languages are spoken in India?</h2>
<p>Over 700 languages are spoken in India. However, India has no national language. As per the 8 th schedule of Indian constitution, there are 22 scheduled or official languages that are given official acknowledgement and support.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-english-the-language-of-government-in-india>Why is English the language of government in India?</h2>
<p>British colonial legacy has resulted in English being a language for government, business and education. English, along with Hindi, is one of the two languages permitted in the Constitution of India for business in Parliament.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-official-language-of-the-union-of-india>Which is the official language of the Union of India?</h2>
<p>The position was thus that the Union government continues to use English in addition to Hindi for its official purposes as a “subsidiary official language,” but is also required to prepare and execute a program to progressively increase its use of Hindi.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-second-most-spoken-language-in-india>Which is the second most spoken language in India?</h2>
<p>Bengali is the second most spoken and understood language in the country with a significant amount of speakers in Eastern and North- eastern regions. However, there have been concerns raised with Hindi being imposed in South India, most notably in the state of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.</p>
