<h2 id=how-did-the-industrial-revolution-affect-life-in-cities>How did the Industrial Revolution affect life in cities?</h2>
<p>Industrialization has historically led to urbanization by creating economic growth and job opportunities that draw people to cities. Urbanization typically begins when a factory or multiple factories are established within a region, thus creating a high demand for factory labor.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-industrial-revolution-negatively-affect-cities>How did the Industrial Revolution negatively affect cities?</h2>
<p>Although there are several positives to the Industrial Revolution there were also many negative elements, including: poor working conditions, poor living conditions, low wages, child labor, and pollution. Industrial towns contained many polluting factories. Child Labor (Mining) in the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-city-life-problematic-during-the-industrial-revolution>Why was city life problematic during the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>The living conditions in the cities and towns were miserable and characterized by: overcrowding, poor sanitation, spread of diseases, and pollution. As well, workers were paid low wages that barely allowed them to afford the cost of living associated with their rent and food.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-industrial-revolution-affect-life>How did the Industrial Revolution affect life?</h2>
<p>The Industrial Revolution brought rapid urbanization or the movement of people to cities. Changes in farming, soaring population growth, and an ever-increasing demand for workers led masses of people to migrate from farms to cities. Almost overnight, small towns around coal or iron mines mushroomed into cities.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-industrial-revolution-change-working-conditions-for-people>How did the Industrial Revolution change working conditions for people?</h2>
<p>Simply, the working conditions were terrible during the Industrial Revolution. As factories were being built, businesses were in need of workers. With a long line of people willing to work, employers could set wages as low as they wanted because people were willing to do work as long as they got paid.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-industrial-revolution-improve-life>Did the Industrial Revolution improve life?</h2>
<p>As the above analysis demonstrates, the industrial revolution resulted in a significant improvement in the quality of life for the working class. However, progress was slow, uneven, and sometimes nonexistent during many periods.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-negative-impacts-of-industrialization>What are the negative impacts of industrialization?</h2>
<p>Some of the drawbacks included air and water pollution and soil contamination that resulted in a significant deterioration of quality of life and life expectancy. Industrialization also exacerbated the separation of labor and capital.</p>
<h2 id=what-benefits-and-problems-did-the-industrial-revolution-created>What benefits and problems did the Industrial Revolution created?</h2>

<li>Pro: Goods Became More Affordable and More Accessible.</li>
<li>Pro: The Rapid Evolution of Labor-Saving Inventions.</li>
<li>Pro: The Rapid Evolution of Medicine.</li>
<li>Pro: Enhanced Wealth and Quality of Life of the Average Person.</li>
<li>Pro: The Rise of Specialist Professions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-were-the-long-term-effects-of-the-industrial-revolution-in-europe>What were the long term effects of the Industrial Revolution in Europe?</h2>
<p>LONG TERM EFFECT: Workers won higher wages, shorter hours, & better conditions. Workers stilled overworked and underpaid. Overseers & skilled workers=lower middle class. Factory owners & merchants=upper middle class.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-effects-of-industrialization>What are effects of industrialization?</h2>
<p>Industrialization has brought economic prosperity; additionally it has resulted in more population, urbanization, obvious stress on the basic life supporting systems while pushing the environmental impacts closer to the threshold limits of tolerance.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-industrial-revolution-affect-peoples-lives>How did the Industrial Revolution affect people’s lives?</h2>
<p>For some it generally improved their lives, however not all were so lucky. The industrial revolution brought with it many changes good for some and bad for others. Between 1760 and 1880 there was a huge growth in the size of cities and a population shift as people started to move into the more industrialised areas in search of work.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-wages-so-low-during-the-industrial-revolution>Why was wages so low during the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>As factories were being built, businesses were in need of workers. With a long line of people willing to work, employers could set wages as low as they wanted because people were willing to do work as long as they got paid.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-street-so-dirty-in-the-industrial-revolution>Why was the street so dirty in the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>The streets were just as dirty. John Harrington invented the toilet in 1596, but bathrooms remained rare luxuries two hundred years later. Chamber pots continued to be emptied into streets, turning them into sewers. To make matters worse, even large towns continued to engage in husbandry well into the 18th century.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hours-did-people-work-in-the-industrial-revolution>How many hours did people work in the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>With a long line of people willing to work, employers could set wages as low as they wanted because people were willing to do work as long as they got paid. People worked fourteen to sixteen hours a day for six days a week.</p>
