<h2 id=is-alaska-colder-than-norway>Is Alaska colder than Norway?</h2>
<p>Despite the similar latitudes, the January average temperature in Norway can be more than 10°C (18°F) warmer than in Alaska. However, these temperatures are far from the norm in the places tourists most often frequent. The average winter temperature in most Norwegian cities hovers at freezing or just below.</p>
<h2 id=is-sweden-colder-than-canada>Is Sweden colder than Canada?</h2>
<p>On average, Canada is colder than Sweden and also has the lowest temperature recorded compared to Sweden. Some places in Sweden are colder than some places in Canada, and vice versa.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-coldest-scandinavian-country>What is the coldest Scandinavian country?</h2>
<p>Finland<br>
Among the Scandinavian countries, Finland is the one with the coldest climate because of the proximity to Russia.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-scandinavia-warmer-than-alaska>Why is Scandinavia warmer than Alaska?</h2>
<p>Thanks for asking, Answer 2: It is because most of Europe has the advantage of the warm ocean current coming north from the tropics. There is then little interaction with colder air masses and colder ocean currents, so the overall weather in Europe is in general warmer that that seen in Alaska and Northern Canada.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-2nd-coldest-country-in-the-world>What is the 2nd coldest country in the world?</h2>
<p>Russia is the 2nd coldest country in the world. It is a landlocked Asian state, which is the coldest in the world. Even in extreme summers, the temperature remains around 03 degree Celsius.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-has-the-worst-weather-in-the-world>What country has the worst weather in the world?</h2>
<p>1. Haiti. The country with the absolute worst weather on the list is none other than the North American nation called Haiti. 6 out of 100,000 people in the country lose their lives due to severe weather conditions.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-coolest-country-in-the-world>What is the coolest country in the world?</h2>
<p>Antarctica<br>
Antarctica is certainly the coldest country in the world, with temperatures sinking as low as -67.3 degrees Celsius.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-coldest-city-in-the-world>What is the coldest city in the world?</h2>
<p>Oymyakon<br>
March 25, 2021. Next time we’re having a brutal cold snap, think of the poor souls in the coldest city on Earth. Winter temperatures in Oymyakon, Russia, average minus 50 C ( minus 58 F). The remote village is generally considered the coldest inhabited area on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-alaska-warmer-than-canada>Why is Alaska warmer than Canada?</h2>
<p>The flow of warm water from the Pacific ocean warms the inside coast of Alaska. It’s actually warmer in the winter in southeast Alaska than it is in Wyoming and much of the upper midwest and mountain west. Alaska does have parts that get really cold north of the Brooks mountain range.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-colder-in-antarctica-or-in-alaska>Which is colder in Antarctica or in Alaska?</h2>
<p>With the current cold snap freezing Alaskans into winter, it’s no surprise to hear that our great state has temperatures even chillier than Antarctica! Many areas of Alaska have temperatures that have dipped farther south than the coldest of Antarctica’s research stations.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-colder-sweden-or-the-united-states>Which is colder Sweden or the United States?</h2>
<p>Some places in Sweden are colder than some places in Canada, and vice versa. Is Canada colder than the USA? Canada is colder than the U.S on average as well as the lowest temperature of all times.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-coldest-place-in-alaska-this-week>Where is the coldest place in Alaska this week?</h2>
<p>Alaska this week has seen the start of a deep freeze. Areas around Tok are experiencing a good -49F. Fairbanks and Chena aren’t far behind at -32F. These temperatures beat even the coldest station in Antarctica, Vostok Station. Vostok has temperatures recorded at around -20F this week.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-coldest-state-in-the-united-states>Which is the coldest state in the United States?</h2>
<p>The lowest temperature ever recorded in the USA was −62.2 °C (−80 °F) in Prospect Creek in Alaska. Some of the coldest states in the U.S are Alaska, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado which ranges between −80 °F / −62 °C to −61 °F / −52 °C on the record low temperatures of each state.</p>
