<h2 id=what-were-3-significant-accomplishments-of-qin-shi-huangdi-that-helped-to-unify-china>What were 3 significant accomplishments of Qin Shi Huangdi that helped to unify China?</h2>
<p>10 Major Achievements of the Qin Dynasty of China</p>
<ul>
<li>#1 Qin dynasty unified China for the first time in history.</li>
<li>#2 It had hugely influential figures like legalist Shang Yang and reformer Li Si.</li>
<li>#3 The writing system of China was standardized.</li>
<li>#4 Qin dynasty established the first meritocratic administration system in China.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-did-the-qin-emperor-unite-china>How did the Qin Emperor unite China?</h2>
<p>In 221 BC, the Qin armies invaded from the north, captured the king, and annexed Qi. Some of the strategies Qin used to unify China were to standardize the trade and communication, currency and language. For the first time, all Chinese lands were unified under one powerful ruler.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-acts-do-you-think-best-shows-how-powerful-shi-huangdi-was>Which of the following acts do you think best shows how powerful Shi Huangdi was?</h2>
<p>Answer Expert Verified. Forcing nobles to move best shows how powerful Shi Huangdi was. Many other Chinese emperors burned books and old records from old dynasties so this wasn’t uncommon.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-qin-shi-huangdi-do-to-unify-china>What did Qin Shi Huangdi do to unify China?</h2>
<p>The unifications were of weights and measures, of the Chinese written language, which made it easier for the different parts of the country to communicate, and of currency, which involved the abolition of the currencies of the former six kingdoms in exchange for Qin coins.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-years-did-qin-shi-huang-rule>How many years did Qin Shi Huang rule?</h2>
<p>Emperor Qin Shi Huang sought immortality through a variety of elixirs. Ironically, some of these elixirs may have contributed to his death in 210 B.C. Upon his death, the emperor had ruled for 37 years. His tomb, close to the city of Xi’an, included an army of more than 6,000 life-size terracotta soldiers (or servants) to protect (or serve) him.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-father-of-qin-shi-huang>Who was the father of Qin Shi Huang?</h2>
<p>The bureaucratic and administrative structure that he institutionalized as emperor remained the basis of all subsequent dynasties in China. Zhao Zheng was born the son of Zhuangxiang (who later became king of the state of Qin in northwestern China) while his father was held hostage in the state of Zhao.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-china-in-221bc>Who was the king of China In 221BC?</h2>
<p>Qin Shi Huangdi or commonly known as just Qin Shi Huang, was the emperor of China from 221BC. Qin Shi Huang (then known as Ying Zheng) became the King of Qin at the age of 13 but did not assume control until he was 22. He was the one responsible for unifying china.</p>
