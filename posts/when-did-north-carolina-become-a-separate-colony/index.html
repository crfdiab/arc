<p>1712<br>
In 1712, North Carolina and South Carolina became distinct colonies.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-carolina-divide-into-north-and-south>When did Carolina divide into north and south?</h2>
<p>In 1712, North and South Carolina were officially divided. By 1729, there were settlements on each of North Carolina’s major river systems.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-carolina-became-a-colony>When did Carolina became a colony?</h2>
<p>July 25, 1729<br>
On July 25, 1729, North Carolina became a royal colony when the Lords Proprietors sold the colony to King George II.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-north-carolina-and-south-carolina-become-separate-colonies>When did North Carolina and South Carolina become separate colonies?</h2>
<p>In 1712, recognizing the different social underpinning of the northern and southern settlements, the proprietors granted the two Carolinas separate assemblies and governors. When the proprietors sold their holdings to the king in 1729, he confirmed North Carolina and South Carolina as separate royal colonies.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-colony-of-north-carolina-called>What was the colony of North Carolina called?</h2>
<p>North Carolina was called Albermarle and was settled by people from Virginia moving south except it was not plantation based and more farms. South Carolina was founded at Charleston many years later and developed into a plantation colony like Virginia.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-english-colony-in-north-america>What was the first English colony in North America?</h2>
<p>North Carolina was the site of the failed Roanoke Colony, the first attempt at a permanent English settlement in North America. It was originally called the Province of Carolina, until it was split into the Provinces of North Carolina and South Carolina in 1712.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-the-thirteen-colonies>What was the population of the Thirteen Colonies?</h2>
<p>By 1775, the thirteen colonies had a population of roughly 2.5 million people. Many of them had been born in the colonies and considered themselves “American.” After some failed colonies, such as those at Roanoke Island, and the split of Carolina into the colonies of North Carolina and South Carolina, there were at this point 13 colonies.</p>
