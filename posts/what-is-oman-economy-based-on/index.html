<h2 id=what-is-oman-economy-based-on>What is Oman economy based on?</h2>
<p>Economy – overview: Oman is heavily dependent on oil and gas resources, which can generate between and 68% and 85% of government revenue, depending on fluctuations in commodity prices.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-oman-make-a-year>How much does Oman make a year?</h2>
<p>$27.02 billion (2019 est.)</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-does-oman-make-from-oil>How much money does Oman make from oil?</h2>
<p>Oman’s 2020 government budget factored in government revenues of OMR 10.7 billion (USD 27.8 billion), based on average oil prices of 58 dollars per barrel, with oil and gas accounting for 51 and 21 percent of total revenue, respectively.</p>
<h2 id=why-oman-currency-is-so-high>Why Oman currency is so high?</h2>
<p>The first reason why the Omani currency is so high is that it was divided into 1000 baisa. The Rial has been worth 2.6 USD since 1986. To maintain this value, Omani retains a significant reserve of US dollars. Given that Oman is one of the leading oil producers in the world, its economy is pegged on oil prices.</p>
<h2 id=who-buys-oman-oil>Who buys Oman oil?</h2>
<p>The most common import partners for Oman are United Arab Emirates ($10.9B), China ($3.02B), Japan ($2.1B), India ($2.07B), and United States ($1.49B).</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-the-us-dollar-cost-in-oman>How much does the US dollar cost in Oman?</h2>
<p>At this rate, the Omani government buys the US dollar at 0.384 Omani rials and sells it at 0.385 rials. This makes Omani one of the few counties that make a significant profit over the dollar in the world.</p>

<h2 id=why-is-the-omani-rial-such-an-expensive-currency>Why is the Omani rial such an expensive currency?</h2>
<p>The Omani Rial currently stands as the third-highest valued currency in the world. For what it’s worth, the Omani currency is relatively too high for the country’s economy. However, based on the fact that the face value was set a 1000 baisa, it is understandable to have the Omani Rial at such high values.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-currency-of-oman-in-1986>What was the currency of Oman in 1986?</h2>
<p>At the time the currency was pegged at 1 Omani rial = 2.895 USD. In 1986 the rate was devalued to stand at 1 Omani rial = 2.6008 USD. The changes to the currency in Omani have been linked with political power shifts in the region.</p>
