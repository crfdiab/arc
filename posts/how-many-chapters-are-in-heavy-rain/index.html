<h2 id=how-many-chapters-are-in-heavy-rain>How many chapters are in Heavy Rain?</h2>
<p>50 chapters<br>
I played Heavy Rain at a moderate pace and finished its 50 chapters in about 10 hours, which is a good length for this sort of narrative game, as it’s roughly equivalent to the runtime of a season of a television show.</p>
<h2 id=is-heavy-rain-a-scary-game>Is Heavy Rain a scary game?</h2>
<p>Heavy Rain puts you through a gut-wrenching dismemberment scene. Joking aside, Heavy Rain has some seriously disturbing moments. The central story — searching for a serial killer and a missing son — is in itself disturbing enough. There are a few things that stand out, however, as a bit tough to stomach.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-heavy-rain-2>Is there a Heavy Rain 2?</h2>
<p>Anyway, there will be no Heavy Rain sequel, but you can look forward to the next “David Cage Presents An Interactive Movie By David Cage” very soon!</p>
<h2 id=is-it-worth-replaying-heavy-rain>Is it worth replaying Heavy Rain?</h2>
<p>Heavy Rain has no replay value (but that’s a good thing?) Playing the game through multiple times, even with the prospect of different endings, is a bad idea according to David Cage. I would like people to have this experience that way,” explains Cage.</p>
<h2 id=does-ethan-always-die-in-heavy-rain>Does Ethan always die in heavy rain?</h2>
<p>If Shaun dies and Ethan lives, Ethan will always commit suicide. While it is possible for all four playable characters to die at the end of the game, it is impossible for all of them to survive – even if they have survived their in-game chapters, all of the characters except Madison can still die in their epilogues.</p>
<h2 id=does-ethan-mars-die>Does Ethan Mars die?</h2>
<p>Out of the four main characters, Ethan has the lowest number of deaths in the game, although he has the highest number of epilogues (“Helpless,” “Origami Blues,” and “Tears in the Rain”) in which he dies.</p>
<h2 id=does-ethan-die-in-heavy-rain>Does Ethan Die in Heavy Rain?</h2>
<p>Epilogue Results Ethan dies. Shaun cries over his father’s grave, looking back toward it one last time as he leaves with his mother Grace. If Madison and/or Scott are still alive, they will be seen watching from afar. Ethan survives and is not imprisoned; Shaun survives; Madison is never kissed, rejected, or dies.</p>
<h2 id=does-jason-always-die-in-heavy-rain>Does Jason always die in Heavy Rain?</h2>
<p>Ethan jumped out in an attempt to save his son, and both were hit. It appears that Ethan took most of the damage, though it is later revealed that Jason died and Ethan was left in a coma. In the version of Heavy Rain before the final cut, the car accident was much more graphic. Jason is voiced by Taylor Gasman.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-replay-heavy-rain>Can you replay heavy rain?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can do that. The only time the game will “forget” what you’ve done is if you play through several chapters, go more than one chapter back and change something major. The game will then not “update” your subsequent chapter saves to reflect that change unless you play and save from that point on.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-way-to-save-ethan-in-heavy-rain>Is there a way to save Ethan in Heavy Rain?</h2>
<p>In order to save him as Ethan or Madison you must try lifting up the hatch. Then pick up the bar on the right (it can be done after the fight with Scott, for example if Madison is alone) and destroy the padlock with it. Next, lift the crate, take Shaun out of the water and reanimate him. It is impossible to fail that.</p>
<h2 id=when-can-ethan-die-in-heavy-rain>When can Ethan die in Heavy Rain?</h2>
<p>The Old Warehouse<br>
Out of the four main characters, Ethan has the lowest number of deaths in the game, although he has the highest number of epilogues (“Helpless,” “Origami Blues,” and “Tears in the Rain”) in which he dies. The only chapter in which Ethan can die is “The Old Warehouse.”</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-story-of-heavy-rain>How long is the story of heavy rain?</h2>
<p>Heavy Rain 1 Main Story 10 Hours 2 Main + Extras 12 Hours 3 Completionist 21½ Hours 4 All Styles 10½ Hours</p>
<h2 id=how-much-rain-does-it-take-in-an-hour>How much rain does it take in an hour?</h2>
<p>Heavy rain: Greater than 4 mm per hour, but less than 8 mm per hour. Very heavy rain: Greater than 8 mm per hour. Slight shower: Less than 2 mm per hour. Moderate shower: Greater than 2 mm, but less than 10 mm per hour. Heavy shower: Greater than 10 mm per hour, but less than 50 mm per hour.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-light-rain-and-heavy-rain>What’s the difference between light rain and heavy rain?</h2>
<p>Slight rain: Less than 0.5 mm per hour. Moderate rain: Greater than 0.5 mm per hour, but less than 4.0 mm per hour. Heavy rain: Greater than 4 mm per hour, but less than 8 mm per hour. Very heavy rain: Greater than 8 mm per hour.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-we-say-that-there-was-10-mm-of-rainfall>When do we say that there was 10 mm of rainfall?</h2>
<p>10 mm rainfall means that if rainfall fell on a flat land surface , with no slope ,no evaporation, and no percolation of water I.e. water does not go underground, then the amount of rainfall would be 10 mm measured from the ground.</p>
