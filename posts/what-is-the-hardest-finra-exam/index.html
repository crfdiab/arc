<h2 id=what-is-the-hardest-finra-exam>What is the hardest finra exam?</h2>
<p>The Series 7 exam is by far the longest and most difficult of all the securities exams. It lasts for 225 minutes and covers all aspects of stock and bond quotes and trading; put and call options; spreads and straddles; ethics; margin, and other account holder requirements; and other pertinent regulations.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-series-6-and-63-securities-licenses>What are Series 6 and 63 securities licenses?</h2>
<p>The Series 6 and Series 63 licenses are documents granting the holder permission to engage in certain securities transactions such as selling shares in mutual funds. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority – FINRA – is a nongovernment entity charged with regulating the financial industry.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-pass-rate-for-the-series-63>What is the pass rate for the Series 63?</h2>
<p>98.36%<br>
The Series 63 pass rate was 98.36%, and the Series 66—one of the most difficult exams—had a pass rate of 88.46%. The firm’s overall pass rate across all exams was 99%.</p>
<h2 id=how-hard-is-it-to-get-your-series-6>How hard is it to get your Series 6?</h2>
<p>What Is the Series 6 Exam Pass Rate? The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) recently reported a 59% pass rate for first-time exam takers. This demonstrates the difficulty of the exam and supports the need for adequate preparation.</p>
<h2 id=is-series-7-harder-than-sie>Is Series 7 harder than Sie?</h2>
<p>The Series 7 Goes Deeper The Series 7 exam is essentially a much more difficult SIE exam. It has 125 questions (plus 10 extra that don’t count toward your score) vs 75 for the SIE exam. A key difference in the SIE vs Series 7 is that the content goes much deeper for the Series 7.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-take-the-series-6-or-63-first>Do you take the Series 6 or 63 first?</h2>
<p>In order to use your Series 6 license in your state, you must pass the state’s version of the Series 63 license exam. If you move from one state to another, you must take your new state’s Series 63 exam to begin working in the securities or insurance industries in that state.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-series-63-hard-to-pass>Is the series 63 hard to pass?</h2>
<p>The Series 63 Exam is hard enough. We recommend that you hit the hardest sections quick so that you have time to learn them thoroughly. As mentioned above, deciphering between state registered vs federally covered can be confusing.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-fail-series-63>What happens if you fail Series 63?</h2>
<p>After a person fails the Series 63 exam the first time, there is a waiting period of at least 30 days before the second taking of that exam can be scheduled. If an exam is failed three times or more, there is a waiting period of at least 180 days for scheduling each subsequent retaking of the test.</p>
<h2 id=is-series-6-or-7-harder>Is Series 6 or 7 harder?</h2>
<p>The Series 6 and the Series 7 are two of the most popular of what FINRA calls its qualification exams. Of the two, the Series 7 is the tougher but more comprehensive exam.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-series-6-license-cost>How much does Series 6 license cost?</h2>
<p>First, they have to pay to take the Series 6 exam. The exam costs $40. Before they become registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), they’ll also have to pass the Securities Industry Essentials exam, which costs $60.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-hardest-exam-in-america>What is the hardest exam in America?</h2>
<p>The California Bar Exam<br>
The California Bar Exam is notorious for being the most difficult bar exam in the United States. In February 2020, the California Bar Exam had an overall pass rate of only 26.8% due to California’s high minimum passing score and large candidate pool.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-series-66-equivalent-to-the-series-63>Is the series 66 equivalent to the series 63?</h2>
<p>That is because passing the Series 66 is equivalent to having passed both the Series 63 and Series 65. Having a valid FINRA Series 7 also is a co-requisite for registering using the Series 66. How long must I wait after failing an exam before I can take it again?</p>
<h2 id=is-the-series-65-exam-administered-by-finra>Is the series 65 exam administered by FINRA?</h2>
<p>The Series 65 exam — the NASAA Investment Advisers Law Examination — is a North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) exam administered by FINRA. The exam consists of 130 scored questions.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-pass-series-65>How long does it take to pass series 65?</h2>
<p>Candidates have 180 minutes to complete the exam. In order for a candidate to pass the Series 65 exam, he/she must correctly answer at least 94 of the 130 scored questions. For additional information about this exam, including the content outline, please visit the exams page on the NASAA website.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-qualifying-professional-designation-waive-the-series-66-requirement>Can a qualifying professional designation waive the series 66 requirement?</h2>
<p>Will having a qualifying professional designation also waive the requirement for taking the Series 66? No, having a qualifying professional designation only will waive the Series 65 requirement. That is because passing the Series 66 is equivalent to having passed both the Series 63 and Series 65.</p>
