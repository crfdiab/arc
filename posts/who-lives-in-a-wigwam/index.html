<h2 id=who-lives-in-a-wigwam>Who lives in a wigwam?</h2>
<p>The names of the Algonquian tribes who lived in the wigwam style house included the Wampanoag, Shawnee, Abenaki, Sauk, Fox (Meskwaki), Pequot, Narragansett, Kickapoo, Ojibwe (Chippewa) and Otoe (Winnebago). Wigwams were suitable for tribes who stayed in the same place for months at a time.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-native-americans-live-in-wigwams>Why did Native Americans live in wigwams?</h2>
<p>The Wigwam was generally used as a shelter by the Native Indian Tribes who lived around the Great Lakes and the East Coast who had access to birch bark from the abundant forests and woodlands in their territories to enable them to build their wigwams. If a wigwam frame was not available, they would make a new one.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-found-inside-a-wigwam>What was found inside a wigwam?</h2>
<p>Different materials were available in different locations, so some wigwams might be made of birchbark while others were made of grass, brush, rushes, mats, reeds, animal hides, or even cloth.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-inside-a-wickiup>What is inside a wickiup?</h2>
<p>The wickiup was constructed of tall saplings driven into the ground, bent over, and tied together near the top. This dome-shaped framework was covered with large overlapping mats of woven rushes or of bark that were tied to the saplings.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-house-was-the-wigwam-made-out-of>What kind of house was the Wigwam made out of?</h2>
<p>What’s a Wigwam? A wigwam was a type of house used mainly by Algonquian peoples but also other Indigenous peoples in the eastern half of North America in precolonial days ( see Indigenous Peoples: Eastern Woodlands ). Wigwams had a dome or cone shape, and were typically made out of wood.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-a-wigwam-used-for-in-the-olden-times>What was a wigwam used for in the olden times?</h2>
<p>Extended families – kids, parents, and grandparents – all lived together in one wigwam. A wigwam is not a tipi. A tipi is totally portable. It is made with long poles covered with hides. Some wigwams were fixed shelters.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-algonquian-indians-build-wigwams>Why did the Algonquian Indians build wigwams?</h2>
<p>Wigwams are good houses for people who stay in the same place for months at a time. Most Algonquian Indians lived together in settled villages during the farming season, but during the winter, each family group would move to their own hunting camp. Wigwams are not portable, but they are small and easy to build.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-term-wigwam-and-wickiup-come-from>Where does the term wigwam and Wickiup come from?</h2>
<p>They are still used for ceremonial events. The term wickiup is generally used to label these kinds of dwellings in the Southwestern United States and Western United States, while wigwam is usually applied to these structures in the Northeastern United States as well as eastern Canada (Ontario and Quebec).</p>
