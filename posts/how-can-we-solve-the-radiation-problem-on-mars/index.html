<h2 id=how-can-we-solve-the-radiation-problem-on-mars>How can we solve the radiation problem on Mars?</h2>
<p>By placing tons of engine assembly, cargo and fuel in between the astronauts and the very directional radiation source that is the sun, this should shield them effectively — though you’d need some emergency shelter on the Martian surface. The primary shielding material for the ISS is polyethylene (HDPE).</p>
<h2 id=how-would-astronauts-be-protected-from-radiation-on-mars>How would astronauts be protected from radiation on Mars?</h2>
<p>On the way to Mars, the crew will be protected from solar particles by the structure of the spacecraft. The water tanks and other storage will be used to create this dedicated radiation shelter that will also function as crew sleeping quarters.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-astronauts-deal-with-radiation>How do astronauts deal with radiation?</h2>
<p>Earth’s protective magnetic bubble, called the magnetosphere, deflects most solar particles. The atmosphere also quells any particles that do make it through. The International Space Station cruises through low-Earth orbit, within Earth’s protection, and the station’s hull helps shield crew members from radiation too.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-protect-from-space-radiation>How can we protect from space radiation?</h2>
<p>Prevention</p>
<ol>
<li>Liquid hydrogen, often used as fuel, tends to give relatively good shielding, while producing relatively low levels of secondary radiation.</li>
<li>Water, which is necessary to sustain life, could also contribute to shielding.</li>
<li>Asteroids could serve to provide shielding.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-can-be-done-about-the-radiation-on-mars>What can be done about the radiation on Mars?</h2>
<p>With some adjustments, such a system could be adapted for Mars, creating an artificial magnetic field that could help shield the surface from some of the harmful radiation it regularly receives. In the event that terraformers attempt to create an atmosphere for Mars, this system could also ensure that it is protected from solar wind.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-too-dangerous-to-go-to-mars>Is it too dangerous to go to Mars?</h2>
<p>Space Radiation Too Deadly For Mars Mission. Dangerous levels of radiation in space could bar astronauts from a mission to Mars and limit prolonged activity on the moon, experts now caution. However, more research could reveal ways to handle the risks that radiation poses to space missions.</p>
<h2 id=how-would-human-beings-protect-themselves-on-mars>How would human beings protect themselves on Mars?</h2>
<p>With all that standing in the way, many people are asking… how would human beings possibly protect themselves in the harsh Martian landscape? Short Answer: Possible solutions include ice-insulated igloos, robot construction crews and a return to agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-any-way-to-protect-astronauts-from-radiation>Is there any way to protect astronauts from radiation?</h2>
<p>Today, as a result of extensive space radiation research, we have a much better understanding of our space environment, its effects, and the best ways to protect astronauts—all crucial parts of NASA’s mission to send humans to Mars. “The Martian” film highlights the radiation dangers that could occur on a round trip to Mars.</p>
