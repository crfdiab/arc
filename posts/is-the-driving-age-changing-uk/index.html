<h2 id=is-the-driving-age-changing-uk>Is the driving age changing UK?</h2>
<p>The driving age could (It’s not yet Law!) be raised to 18 in an attempt to slash the death toll on our roads. Also young people could be forced to wait until they are 19 before they qualify for a full licence under radical plans being considered by ministers. Currently they can be driving independently at 17.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-nz-driving-age-changing>Is the NZ driving age changing?</h2>
<p>The minimum legal age for learner drivers licence goes up from 15 to 16 on 1 August. The Transport Agency says the change was needed as New Zealand’s death rate for 15 to 17-year-olds on the road is the highest in the OECD. It says the age increase will save about five lives per year.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-still-drive-at-85>Can you still drive at 85?</h2>
<p>There is no upper age limit for driving a car. However, all drivers have to renew their driving licence when they reach the age of 70 and every three years from then on. The renewal form will be sent to you automatically by the Driver Vehicle Licence Agency (DVLA) 90 days before your 70th birthday.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-15-year-old-drive-in-nz>Can a 15 year old drive in NZ?</h2>
<p>New Zealand has increased its minimum driving age from 15 to 16 in an effort to make its roads safer. The country has one of the lowest driving ages in the developed world, the legacy of an agriculture-driven economy in which teenagers are expected to be able to operate farm vehicles from a young age.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-to-raise-the-driving-age>Why do we need to raise the driving age?</h2>
<p>Steve Kirk, Bolton, Greater Manchester It should be raised to the age of 21. This would reduce accidents, free up roads, increase use of public transport, make young people walk or cycle thereby promoting health and energy, ensure that some maturity and responsibility in life was achieved prior to driving, and would reduce insurance costs for all.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-get-a-driving-licence-in-england>How old do you have to be to get a driving licence in England?</h2>
<p>Currently drivers in England, Scotland and Wales need to pass a theory test, then a practical test before they can apply for a full driving licence. The minimum age to hold a full car licence is 17, or 16 for some people claiming mobility benefit.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-take-your-driving-test>How old do you have to be to take your driving test?</h2>
<p>It recommends a one-year “learner stage” beginning at 17, during which drivers would have to total at least 100 hours of daytime and 20 hours of night-time practice under supervision. Learners can then take their test at 18 and, if they pass, will get a probationary licence and have to display a green “P” plate.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-killed-by-young-drivers-in-uk>How many people are killed by young drivers in UK?</h2>
<p>A Department for Transport spokesman said: “Young drivers drive around 5% of all the miles driven in Britain but are involved in about 20% of the crashes where someone is killed or seriously injured.</p>
