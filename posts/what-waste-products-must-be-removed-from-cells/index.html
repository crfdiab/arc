<h2 id=what-waste-products-must-be-removed-from-cells>What waste products must be removed from cells?</h2>
<p>Our cells make carbon dioxide as a waste product from the process of converting food to energy. That carbon dioxide — and some water vapor — are removed by the lungs when we breathe and exhale them back into the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=what-gaseous-waste-must-be-removed-from-all-organisms>What gaseous waste must be removed from all organisms?</h2>
<p>This is the job of the excretory system. You remove waste as a gas (carbon dioxide), as a liquid (urine and sweat), and as a solid. Excretion is the process of removing wastes and excess water from the body. Recall that carbon dioxide travels through the blood and is transferred to the lungs where it is exhaled.</p>

<li>Smokeless fuels can be used by industries.</li>
<li>Hydrocarbon emissions of vehicles can be controlled by use of unleaded petrol.</li>
<li>To control sulphur dioxide concentration in air, low sulphur fuels can be used.</li>

<h2 id=why-it-is-important-to-remove-waste-from-the-body>Why it is important to remove waste from the body?</h2>
<p>Our body produces various wastes during the process of digestion and other metabolic reactions. It is necessary to remove these wastes because they are toxic for our body. In the Urinary system, Kidneys eliminate excess water, toxins and urea. This helps in maintaining electrolytic balance.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-small-organisms-need-to-remove-waste-substances>Why do small organisms need to remove waste substances?</h2>
<p>Organisms also need to remove waste substances. Small organisms exchange these essential and waste substances between themselves and the environment. They do this over their body surface. Simple chemical substances can diffuse in and out of their bodies. Inside their bodies, in small organisms, substances don’t have to move far.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-cells-able-to-get-rid-of-waste-products>How are cells able to get rid of waste products?</h2>
<p>Cells can bias the movement of waste molecules out of and away from themselves. One way is to temporarily convert the waste product into a different molecule that will not diffuse backwards. Another way is the make an oily molecule water-soluble, so that it can be dissolved in water and flushed away in the bloodstream.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-human-body-get-rid-of-chemical-waste>How does the human body get rid of chemical waste?</h2>
<p>This electrically charged attachment allows the oily waste product to dissolve in water. Thus, making an oily molecule water-soluble allows it to be flushed away by the water in the bloodstream. The human body sweats to release heat in order to cool the body, but sweating is also a way that cells get rid of chemical waste products.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-waste-product-of-plant-excretion>Which is a waste product of plant excretion?</h2>
<p>Excretion is not the same as egestion – which is the passing out of undigested food through the anus as faeces. Plants need to excrete excess carbon dioxide and oxygen. Carbon dioxide is a waste product of aerobic respiration in plant cells. Oxygen is a waste product of photosynthesis.</p>
