<h2 id=do-cats-have-a-sense-of-direction>Do cats have a sense of direction?</h2>
<p>Some cats are known to be gifted with a good sense of direction but the reasons remain partially unknown. Cats may be among those animals able to sense the Earth’s magnetic fields. Also, the presence of iron in mammals’ inner ears and skin may act like a natural compass.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-away-can-a-cat-find-its-way-home>How far away can a cat find its way home?</h2>
<p>According to Dr John Bradshaw of the School of Veterinary Science at Bristol University and author of Cat Sense, most cats roam between 40 and 200 metres (131 and 656 feet) from the home. One exception to this is farm cats who will cover a much larger area.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-cat-know-to-use-the-litter-box>How does a cat know to use the litter box?</h2>
<p>“Given the texture and consistency of most commercially available cat litters, it makes it easier for cats to cover their droppings, which is what naturally draws them towards a litter box.” So, right from the start, they are drawn to the litter box when they need to go to the bathroom.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-cat-view-its-owner>How does a cat view its owner?</h2>
<p>Researchers from Tokyo University found that cats do recognize their owners’ voices. In 2013, scientists played recordings of the cats’ names being called by their owners and by total strangers; the cats reacted most strongly to their owners’ voices.</p>
<h2 id=do-cats-remember-where-they-live>Do cats remember where they live?</h2>
<p>Cats and other animals use associative memory to store away information that helps them survive. Unsurprisingly, this means remembering the places where they get food and shelter. These associative memories are what regulate a cat’s ongoing behavior.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-cats-know-their-name>How do cats know their name?</h2>
<p>A study by behavioral scientist Atsuko Saito from Sophia University in Tokyo found cats can indeed recognize their owner’s voice. Results indicated that the cats responded more significantly to their own names by meowing or moving their ears, heads or tails than to similar words or other cats’ names.</p>
<h2 id=do-cats-forget-their-owners-in-3-days>Do cats forget their owners in 3 days?</h2>
<p>Cats do not forget their owners within 3 days because they have excellent memories. They remember things based on an associative and selective memory, which means that they will remember important aspects of their lives, such as where to find food and shelter in order to survive and thrive.</p>
<h2 id=can-cats-find-their-litter-box-if-you-move-it>Can cats find their litter box if you move it?</h2>
<p>“You don’t want to make sudden changes with the litter box by moving it from a place where it was for a long time,” she says. “Cats are very sensitive to sudden changes to their environment. They may not take the time to look” for the box’s new location. Some cat owners find innovative solutions to litter box problems.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-cats-think-when-we-kiss-them>What do cats think when we kiss them?</h2>
<p>Some cats do seem to like or at least tolerate human kisses. If your cat leans in, purrs, and rubs his head on you when you kiss him, he probably understands that you’re trying to show him affection.</p>
<h2 id=do-cats-forgive-abuse>Do cats forgive abuse?</h2>
<p>Yes, a cat will forgive you for hitting her after a little love and treats. But cats will remember long-term abuse they receive in a household. This is because cats have strong survival instincts, which force them to remember abuse for a long time.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-cats-able-to-find-their-way>How are cats able to find their way?</h2>
<p>At present, we are still unable to fully determine how a cat is able to navigate her way back home. Theories posit that a cat may instinctively be able to choose the correct direction even if she finds herself in a place for the first time. But how? Cats may be among those animals able to sense the Earth’s magnetic fields.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-cats-have-a-good-sense-of-direction>Why do cats have a good sense of direction?</h2>
<p>Some cats are known to be gifted with a good sense of direction but the reasons remain partially unknown. At present, we are still unable to fully determine how a cat is able to navigate her way back home. Theories posit that a cat may instinctively be able to choose the correct direction even if she finds herself in a place for the first time.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-a-cat-travels-the-same-distance>What does it mean when a cat travels the same distance?</h2>
<p>A cat that travels the same distance is—sorry cat owners—probably just tying to return to its territory. No matter how well animals navigate, scientists caution against an observation bias that may make them seem better than they are.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-geolocating-cat-find-its-way-home>When did the geolocating Cat find its way home?</h2>
<p>Even more impressive was the 2013 tale of the geolocating cat that had been lost and found its way home after a journey of two months and 200 miles. So how do animals manage such prodigious—and precise—feats of travel?</p>
