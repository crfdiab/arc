<h2 id=what-type-of-fighting-helped-the-colonists-defeat-the-british>What type of fighting helped the colonists defeat the British?</h2>
<p>There were several key factors contributing to the Colonists’ victory over the British, such as war tactics, strong leadership and one solid alliance. Despite facing larger forces, better trained armies, and more weapons, the Colonists managed to win.</p>
<h2 id=what-methods-did-the-colonists-use-to-protect-british-policies>What methods did the colonists use to protect British policies?</h2>
<p>The colonists started to resist by boycotting, or not buying, British goods. In 1773 some colonists in Boston, Massachusetts demonstrated their frustration by dressing up like Indians, sneaking onto ships in the harbor, and dumping imported tea into the water. This was called the Boston Tea Party.</p>
<h2 id=what-method-did-colonists-use-to-hurt-the-british-during-the-american-revolution>What method did colonists use to hurt the British during the American Revolution?</h2>
<p>The Tea Act of 1773 was one of several measures imposed on the American colonists by the heavily indebted British government in the decade leading up to the American Revolutionary War (1775-83).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-effective-method-of-american-colonial-protest-against-british-taxation>What was the most effective method of American Colonial protest against British taxation?</h2>
<p>Then you can decide which form of protest was the most effective. One very effective method was to claim that these taxes violated the rights of the colonists. British citizens were supposed to have elected representatives that can speak about and vote on proposed taxes.</p>
<h2 id=what-advantages-did-the-british-have-over-the-colonists>What advantages did the British have over the colonists?</h2>
<p>Britain’s military was the best in the world. Their soldiers were well equipped, well disciplined, well paid, and well fed. The British navy dominated the seas. Funds were much more easily raised by the Empire than by the Continental Congress.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-effective-way-to-protest-british-law>What was the most effective way to protest British law?</h2>
<p>A popular method of protest was the ​boycott​, in which people refused to buy British goods. The first colonial boycott started in New York in 1765. It soon spread to other colonies. Colonists hoped that their efforts would hurt the British economy and Page 2 might convince Parliament to end the new taxes.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-americans-keep-the-british-from-taking-the-southern-colonies>How did the Americans keep the British from taking the southern colonies?</h2>
<p>The didn’t have decent food, clothes, or shelter. What fighting method did the Americans use to keep the British from taking the Southern Colonies? They used Guerrilla Warfare. Which battle convinced the British that fighting the Americans was too costly? The Battle at Yorktown.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-some-type-of-colonial-protest-against-the-british>What was some type of colonial protest against the British?</h2>
<p>Other American protests were more economic in nature. The most important of these was the nonimportation movement. This movement encouraged Americans to refrain from buying British goods because of things like the Stamp Tax.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonists-fight-against-the-british>Why did the colonists fight against the British?</h2>
<p>Soldiers, securely housed and fed, often offered to work for less than the living wage, arousing resentment among working class colonists. Parliament imposed a series of taxes on the colonies. These taxes, enacted without assent from the colonies, galvanized opposition to the British and led to colonial resistance.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-british-plan-to-do-in-the-revolutionary-war>What did the British plan to do in the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>“In practical terms, the British planned to seize control of the Hudson River and cordon off the New England colonies, and only then to move south and, with the help of settlers loyal to the Crown (the ‘Loyalists’), conquer the southern colonies.</p>
