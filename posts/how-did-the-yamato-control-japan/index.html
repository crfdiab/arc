<h2 id=how-did-the-yamato-control-japan>How did the Yamato control Japan?</h2>
<p>In the seventh century, the Yamato transformed the government of Japan based on influences from China. The Yamato sovereign became an imperial ruler supported by court and administrative officials. The uji class was stripped of land and military power, but given official posts and stipends.</p>

<h2 id=what-clan-came-after-the-soga-clan-in-japan>What clan came after the Soga clan in Japan?</h2>
<p>The rival Mononobe and Nakatomi clans succeeded in gathering hostility against this new religion when a disease spread, following the arrival of a Buddhist statue.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-yamato-clan-come-to-japan>When did the Yamato clan come to Japan?</h2>
<p>Yamato clan. The Yamato clan (和氏), also known as Yamato no Fuhito (和史), was an immigrant clan active in Japan since the Kofun period (250–538), according to the history of Japan laid out in the Nihon Shoki.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-court-at-yamato-do-for-japan>What did the court at Yamato do for Japan?</h2>
<p>From the court at Yamato, its rulers extended control along the Inland Sea and beyond, developing more sophisticated offices and units to control the peoples of the archipelago. The pattern of administrative control established is called the uji-kabane system. Uji is usually translated as “clan” in English.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-yamato-kingdom-important-to-japan>Why was the Yamato kingdom important to Japan?</h2>
<p>Yamato was most closely associated with the southeastern kingdom of Paekche, whence came the “seven-pronged sword.” Contact with the mainland, although involving conflict, also encouraged a marked rise in standards of living in the archipelago, as many of the fruits of advanced Chinese civilization reached Japan via people from the peninsula.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-japanese-battleship-yamato>What was the purpose of the Japanese battleship Yamato?</h2>
<p>Yamato escorted Transport Operation BO-1 from Truk to Yokosuka during 12–17 December. Subsequently, because of their extensive storage capacity and thick armor protection, Yamato and Musashi were pressed into service as transport vessels.</p>
