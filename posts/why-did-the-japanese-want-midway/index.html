<h2 id=why-did-the-japanese-want-midway>Why did the Japanese want Midway?</h2>
<p>Japan hoped to defeat the US Pacific Fleet and use Midway as a base to attack Pearl Harbor, securing dominance in the region and then forcing a negotiated peace.</p>
<h2 id=what-month-and-year-did-the-battle-of-midway-happen>What month and year did the Battle of Midway happen?</h2>
<p>On June 4, 1942, the Battle of Midway–one of the most decisive U.S. victories against Japan during World War II–begins.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-facts-about-the-midway-islands>What are the facts about the Midway Islands?</h2>
<p>The Midway Islands consist of a circular atoll, 6 mi in diameter, that encloses two islands. Lying about 1,150 mi west-northwest of Hawaii, the islands were first explored by Captain N. C. Brooks on July 5, 1859, in the name of the U.S. The atoll was declared a U.S. possession in 1867, and in 1903 Theodore Roosevelt made it a naval reservation.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-us-take-possession-of-midway-atoll>When did the US take possession of Midway Atoll?</h2>
<p>On August 28, 1867, Captain William Reynolds of USS Lackawanna formally took possession of the atoll for the United States; the name changed to “Midway” some time after this. The atoll was the first Pacific island annexed by the United States, as the Unincorporated Territory of Midway Island, and was administered by the United States Navy .</p>
<h2 id=when-was-midway-island-annexed-by-the-us>When was Midway Island annexed by the US?</h2>
<p>Midway becomes the first offshore islands annexed by the U.S. government. January 28, 1869 – The Navy adopts the name Midway Islands, according to a report submitted to the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. November 16, 1886 – The schooner General Siegel was shipwrecked at Midway during a storm.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-midway-atoll-able-to-maintain-its-coral-reef>Why was Midway Atoll able to maintain its coral reef?</h2>
<p>As the volcano piled up lava flows building the island, its weight depressed the crust and the island slowly subsided over a period of millions of years, a process known as isostatic adjustment . As the island subsided, a coral reef around the former volcanic island was able to maintain itself near sea level by growing upwards.</p>
