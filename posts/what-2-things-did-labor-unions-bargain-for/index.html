<h2 id=what-2-things-did-labor-unions-bargain-for>What 2 Things did labor unions bargain for?</h2>
<p>For those in the industrial sector, organized labor unions fought for better wages, reasonable hours and safer working conditions. The labor movement led efforts to stop child labor, give health benefits and provide aid to workers who were injured or retired.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-labor-unions>What is the purpose of labor unions?</h2>
<p>Unions are the principal means for workers to organize and protect their rights on the job. The union contract or “collective bargaining agreement” establishes the basic terms and conditions of work. Unions give workers a voice with employers and provide a means to gain a measure of security and dignity on the job.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-union-bargaining-issues>What are the union bargaining issues?</h2>
<p>There are three main classification of bargaining topics: mandatory, permissive, and illegal. Wages, health and safety, management rights, work conditions, and benefits fall into the mandatory category. Permissive topics are those that are not required but may be brought up during the process.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-unions-get-paid>How do unions get paid?</h2>
<p>As with many other organizations, union costs are paid by member dues that typically cost about $50 a month. Most unions have paid staff to manage their operations. While some staff may be paid by union dues, members also often volunteer.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-negotiate-salary-in-a-union>Can you negotiate salary in a union?</h2>
<p>The National Labor Relations Act requires a duly elected union and an employer to meet and negotiate over wages, hours, and other employment terms, as well as to negotiate over issues that may arise under an existing CBA. The two sides don’t have to reach an agreement, but they always have to bargain in good faith.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-a-labor-union>What do you need to know about a labor union?</h2>
<p>Multiple negotiation rounds are conducted between the bargaining party and the employer, after which a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is agreed upon and signed. The CBA outlines pay scales and includes other terms of employment, such as vacation and sick days, benefits, working hours, and working conditions.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-collective-bargaining>What do you need to know about collective bargaining?</h2>
<p>Collective Bargaining. Collective bargaining is the process in which working people, through their unions, negotiate contracts with their employers to determine their terms of employment, including pay, benefits, hours, leave, job health and safety policies, ways to balance work and family, and more.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-do-before-bargaining-with-the-union>What should I do before bargaining with the Union?</h2>
<p>Set initial terms and conditions of employment before bargaining with the union, if you acquire a business and refuse to hire employees of the predecessor to avoid becoming a Burns successor.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-bargaining-unit-work-with-an-employer>How does a bargaining unit work with an employer?</h2>
<p>The bargaining unit, as its name implies, works with an employer to negotiate and assure that its members are properly compensated and represented. U.S. law requires the employer—in this case a school district—to actively bargain with the union in good faith. However, the employer is not required to agree to any specific terms.</p>
