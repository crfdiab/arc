<h2 id=which-state-owns-the-ohio-river>Which state owns the Ohio River?</h2>
<p>Kentucky<br>
In 1792, the federal government determined that Kentucky owned the Ohio River along its border with Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. In essence, the boundary between Kentucky and these three future states would be the low point of the Ohio River’s northernmost bank.</p>
<h2 id=does-ohio-own-any-of-the-ohio-river>Does Ohio own any of the Ohio River?</h2>
<p>The agreement today gives Ohio and Indiana control of the river for a minimum of 100 feet from the present shoreline, and more than 500 feet in some places.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-ohio-river-not-in-virginia>Why is the Ohio River not in Virginia?</h2>
<p>The Court, however, ruled that because Virginia had owned the Ohio River originally, it should remain a part of Virginia’s domain, Carvell noted. As a result, when Virginia lost its westernmost counties, counties that became part of West Virginia, the river boundary went with them. West Virginia became a state in 1863.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-ohio-river-get-its-water>Where does the Ohio River get its water?</h2>
<p>First, the Ohio River is the source of drinking water for approximately 3 million people. It also supports marine life of about 160 species of fish. Secondly, the river defines the borders of several states namely Ohio and West Virginia, Illinois and Kentucky, Indiana and Kentucky, as well as Ohio and Kentucky.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-state-of-ohio-get-its-name>How did the state of Ohio get its name?</h2>
<p>The state takes its name from the Ohio River, whose name in turn originated from the Seneca word ohiːyo’, meaning “good river”, “great river” or “large creek”. The Ohio River forms its southern border, though nearly all of the river itself belongs to Kentucky and West Virginia.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-original-owner-of-the-ohio-river>Who was the original owner of the Ohio River?</h2>
<p>Since the late 1700s, various states have claimed ownership of various stretches of the Ohio River. The principal reason was to garner wealth from the trade that occured on the river. In 1792, the federal government determined that Kentucky owned the Ohio River along its border with Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.</p>
