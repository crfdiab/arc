<h2 id=did-margaret-thatcher-believe-in-communism>Did Margaret Thatcher believe in communism?</h2>
<p>Thatcher was a strong critic of communism, Marxism and socialism. Biographer John Campbell reports that in July 1978 when asked by a Labour MP in Commons what she meant by socialism “she was at a loss to reply.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-stop-communism-in-eastern-europe>How did the US stop communism in Eastern Europe?</h2>
<p>American leaders responded to the Soviet control of Eastern Europe by developing a policy of containment – the United States would prevent communism from spreading to additional countries, even though it would not challenge communism where it already existed.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-fall-of-communism-in-eastern-europe>Who was fall of communism in Eastern Europe?</h2>
<p>A new, non-communist government took the country’s reins on December 5, and on December 29, Vaclav Havel, the famed playwright and dissident, was elected President.</p>
<h2 id=in-which-two-countries-did-the-united-states-attempt-to-stop-the-spread-of-communism>In which two countries did the United States attempt to stop the spread of communism?</h2>
<p>Containment was a foreign policy of the United States of America, introduced at the start of the Cold War, aimed at stopping the spread of Communism and keeping it “contained” and isolated within its current borders of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR or the Soviet Union) instead of spreading to a war- …</p>

<h2 id=how-long-did-the-thatcher-battle-with-europe-last>How long did the Thatcher battle with Europe last?</h2>
<p>The battle lasted four years and finally ended in victory for Thatcher but damaged relations with other EC countries. Then came Westland – Michael Heseltine’s battle to keep the helicopter company in European hands with a takeover by a European consortium.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-margaret-thatchers-battle-with-sikorsky>What was the result of Margaret Thatchers battle with Sikorsky?</h2>
<p>The battle lasted four years and finally ended in victory for Thatcher but damaged relations with other EC countries. Then came Westland – Michael Heseltine’s battle to keep the helicopter company in European hands with a takeover by a European consortium. Mrs Thatcher was insistent that the US firm Sikorsky should have it instead.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-mrs-thatcher-agree-to-join-the-erm>When did Mrs Thatcher agree to join the ERM?</h2>
<p>All of this came against a backdrop of a government split over whether to join the ERM, which Mrs Thatcher eventually agreed to do in October 1990, little knowing that she was in the final days of her premiership.
