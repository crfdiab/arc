<h2 id=what-kind-of-political-party-is-brazil>What kind of political party is Brazil?</h2>
<p>Above the broad range of political parties in Brazilian Congress, the Workers’ Party (PT), the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), the Social Liberal Party (PSL) and the Democrats (DEM) together control the absolute majority of seats in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies.</p>
<h2 id=is-brazil-all-slums>Is Brazil all slums?</h2>
<p>Unable to find places to live, many people found themselves in favelas. Census data released in December 2011 by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) showed that in 2010, about 6 percent of the Brazilian population lived in favelas and other slums.</p>
<h2 id=is-brazil-a-poor-place>Is Brazil a poor place?</h2>
<p>To put it simply, Brazil is a nation of stark contrasts. Although the nation has some of the wealthiest in the world, many more suffer from extreme poverty. 26% of the population still lives below the poverty line.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-political-parties-start-in-brazil>When did the political parties start in Brazil?</h2>
<p>With the return of democracy, in 1986, and the establishment of the 1988 Constitution, the multiparty political system was set back and several parties were founded. This back and forward of Brazilian political party system generated an enormous amount of parties, most of them with confusing and nonsensical ideas.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-political-system-does-brazil-have>What kind of political system does Brazil have?</h2>
<p>Numerous parties. As stressed above, Brazil has a multiparty political system, with full freedom affiliation. We live in what some social science analysts call of Coalition Democracy, where no party can gain power alone, they have to create alliances in order to stand for the elections and govern.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-that-there-is-communism-in-brazil>Is it true that there is communism in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Communism in Brazil. Brazil is one of the few countries where the communism is in the current political situation and is widely accepted by the population. This article will outline the communist history in Brazil, their position in the country and why it still is an active force in the Brazilian politics.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-leader-of-the-workers-party-in-brazil>Who is the leader of the Workers Party in Brazil?</h2>
<p>The Worker’s Party was officially launched in 1982, from a trade union organization of workers in the state of São Paulo, led by former president Luis Inácio Lula da Silva. After Lula’s administration (2003-2011), PT successfully conducted other of its members, president Dilma Roussef, to presidency.</p>
