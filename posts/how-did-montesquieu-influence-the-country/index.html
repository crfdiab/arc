<h2 id=how-did-montesquieu-influence-the-country>How did Montesquieu influence the country?</h2>
<p>Montesquieu’s views and studies of governments led to him to believe that government corruption was probable if a system of government didn’t include balance of powers. He conceived the idea of separating government authority into the three major branches: executive, legislative and judicial.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-montesquieu-ideas-influence>What did Montesquieu ideas influence?</h2>
<p>Montesquieu’s writing and ideologies in his book The Spirit of the Laws had a major impact on modern society, helping create the bases for the democratic institutions after the French revolution, and can even be seen in the constitution of the United States of America.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-montesquieu-influence>Who did Montesquieu influence?</h2>
<p>The Founding Fathers were heavily influenced by French philosopher Charles Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu when drafting the Constitution, most notably in connection with the separation of powers. Born on January 18, 1689, in Bordeaux, France, Montesquieu was trained in the classics as well as the law.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-considered-montesquieu-most-influential-work>What is considered Montesquieu most influential work?</h2>
<p>French political philosopher Montesquieu was best known for The Spirit of Laws (1748), one of the great works in the history of political theory and of jurisprudence.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-montesquieu-believe-in>What does Montesquieu believe in?</h2>
<p>Montesquieu concluded that the best form of government was one in which the legislative, executive, and judicial powers were separate and kept each other in check to prevent any branch from becoming too powerful. He believed that uniting these powers, as in the monarchy of Louis XIV, would lead to despotism.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-montesquieu-feel-about-equality>How did Montesquieu feel about equality?</h2>
<p>People’s role in government, Montesquieu believed, should be based on political virtue (moral goodness) and equality. Montesquieu argued that the best government is one in which power is balanced among three separate branches of government with equal but different powers.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-montesquieu-argue-in-the-persian-letters>What did Montesquieu argue in the Persian letters?</h2>
<p>Certain points made in the Persian Letters anticipate what Montesquieu later argued more extensively—that men are always born into a society and that it is therefore meaningless to discuss the origin of society and government; that self-interest is not a sufficient basis for human institutions, as Hobbes had asserted; …</p>
<h2 id=why-was-charles-louis-montesquieu-so-important>Why was Charles Louis Montesquieu so important?</h2>
<p>Charles-Louis Montesquieu lived in 18th century France and became one of the most influential political philosophers due to his influence on the creation of American government. Throughout his lifetime, Montesquieu wrote several books addressing various political topics.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-maximilien-de-robespierre-worry-about-montesquieu>Why did Maximilien de Robespierre worry about Montesquieu?</h2>
<p>Political views. Montesquieu worried that in France the intermediate powers (i.e., the nobility) which moderated the power of the prince were being eroded. These ideas of the control of power were often used in the thinking of Maximilien de Robespierre .</p>
<h2 id=how-did-montesquieu-influence-the-development-of-modern-anthropology>How did Montesquieu influence the development of modern anthropology?</h2>
<p>By placing an emphasis on environmental influences as a material condition of life, Montesquieu prefigured modern anthropology’s concern with the impact of material conditions, such as available energy sources, organized production systems, and technologies, on the growth of complex socio-cultural systems.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-theme-of-montesquieus-book>What was the main theme of Montesquieu’s book?</h2>
<p>The book addresses several issues through the use of satire, with the primary topic being the political corruption in France. While this is definitely part of the partially discovered theme, Montesquieu also addresses the volatile state of religion in France in this work.</p>
