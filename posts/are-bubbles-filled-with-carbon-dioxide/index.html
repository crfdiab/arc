<h2 id=are-bubbles-filled-with-carbon-dioxide>Are bubbles filled with carbon dioxide?</h2>
<p>A bubble is full of air. It floats on the carbon dioxide layer, just like a helium balloon floating in the air. You might expect that the air in the bubble would cool and contract near the dry ice, but the bubble actually expands slightly.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-bubble-contain-air>Does a bubble contain air?</h2>
<p>A bubble is just air wrapped in soap film. Soap film is made from soap and water (or other liquid). The outside and inside surfaces of a bubble consist of soap molecules. A thin layer of water lies between the two layers of soap molecules, sort of like a water sandwich with soap molecules for bread.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-bubble-made-of>What is a bubble made of?</h2>
<p>The wall of a bubble is actually made of three layers; An inner and outer layer made of soap or detergent and a layer of water in between. It’s like a water sandwich with soap as the bread. Water evaporating from the bubble film makes the bubble film so thin that the bubble pops. The wall of a bubble is extremely thin.</p>
<h2 id=are-bubbles-lighter-than-air>Are bubbles lighter than air?</h2>
<p>Bubbles are not lighter than air but are mainly composed of air with an extremely thin wall of water and detergent which makes then very light and able to be blow about by wind and thermal currents.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-bubbles-float-but-eventually-sink>Why do bubbles float but eventually sink?</h2>
<p>If the molecules of an object are very tightly packed, it has a high density. Because the air trapped inside a bubble is less dense than the air outside the bubble, it’s up, up and away! The heavier carbon dioxide in the air around the bubble pushes up on the air trapped inside the bubble and off it goes.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-drink-water-with-bubbles-in-it>Is it safe to drink water with bubbles in it?</h2>
<p>Water with air bubbles is perfectly safe to drink. The solubility of gases in still water decreases with increasing temperature. Therefore the manifestation of bubbles in bottled water is due to a rise in temperature and expulsion of dissolved air.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-bubbles-in-water-go-up>Why do bubbles in water go up?</h2>
<h2 id=are-bubbles-dangerous>Are bubbles dangerous?</h2>
<p>Bubbles are minimally toxic, but may cause mild irritation to the stomach or intestines.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-bubbling>What is the purpose of bubbling?</h2>
<p>The technique of bubbling helps swimmers to breathe properly. When you swim, you inhale through your mouth when your face is above water and exhale through your mouth or nose when your face is underwater.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-bubbles-float-and-then-sink>Why do bubbles float and then sink?</h2>
<p>As the amount of carbon dioxide in the bubble increases, the bubble becomes heavier and sinks lower into the carbon dioxide in which it is floating.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-bubbles-initially-float-but-eventually-sink>Why do bubbles initially float but eventually sink?</h2>
<p>Because the air trapped inside a bubble is less dense than the air outside the bubble, it’s up, up and away! The heavier carbon dioxide in the air around the bubble pushes up on the air trapped inside the bubble and off it goes.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-air-go-in-a-bubble>Where does the air go in a bubble?</h2>
<p>The denser carbon dioxide gas forms a layer on the bottom of the container. A bubble is full of air. It floats on the carbon dioxide layer, just like a helium balloon floating in the air. You might expect that the air in the bubble would cool and contract near the dry ice, but the bubble actually expands slightly.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-up-the-bottom-of-a-bubble>What makes up the bottom of a bubble?</h2>
<p>(Carbon dioxide molecules have an atomic mass of 44 amu [atomic mass units]. Air is made up mostly of nitrogen, 28 amu, and oxygen, 32 amu.) The denser carbon dioxide gas forms a layer on the bottom of the container. A bubble is full of air. It floats on the carbon dioxide layer, just like a helium balloon floating in the air.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-carbon-dioxide-is-bubbled-through-a-solution>What happens when carbon dioxide is bubbled through a solution?</h2>
<p>When you bubble carbon dioxide through the solution, it forms a solid precipitate of calcium carbonate – chalk or limestone. Calcium carbonate is insoluble in water.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-gas-is-used-to-make-a-bubble>What kind of gas is used to make a bubble?</h2>
<p>Most of the bubblesthat you see are filled with air, but you can make a bubble using other gasses, such as carbon dioxide. The film that makes the bubble has three layers. A thin layer of water is sandwiched between two layers of soap molecules.</p>
