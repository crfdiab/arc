<h2 id=what-is-the-bayeux-tapestry-and-what-does-it-tell-us-about-king-harold>What is the Bayeux Tapestry and what does it tell us about King Harold?</h2>
<p>The Bayeux Tapestry is a masterpiece of 11th century Romanesque art, which was probably commissioned by Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror’s half-brother, to embellish his newly-built cathedral in Bayeux in 1077. The Tapestry tells the story of the events surrounding the conquest of England by the Duke of Normandy.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-harold-on-the-bayeux-tapestry>Where is Harold on the Bayeux Tapestry?</h2>
<p>Harold in northern France (Bayeux Tapestry) This scene is stated in the previous scene on the Tapestry to have taken place at Bagia (Bayeux, probably in Bayeux Cathedral). It shows Harold touching two altars with the enthroned Duke looking on, and is central to the Norman Invasion of England.</p>
<h2 id=is-harald-hardrada-in-the-bayeux-tapestry>Is Harald Hardrada in the Bayeux Tapestry?</h2>
<p>Harald Hardrada, the King of Norway, invaded England to pursue his claim on the English throne, and was accompanied by Harold’s own brother, Tostig. The tapestry tells us ‘here King Harold has been killed’, struck down by the sword of a mounted Norman knight.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-harold-godwinson-die-according-to-the-primary-sources-particularly-the-bayeux-tapestry>How did Harold Godwinson die according to the primary sources particularly the Bayeux Tapestry?</h2>
<p>Even the Bayeux Tapestry does not offer a clear answer. Near the phrase ‘King Harold was killed’ (‘Haroldus rex interfectus est’), there are images in the tapestry of men being shot with arrows and cut down with swords. All we know for certain is that Harold was killed in the battle.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-bayeux-tapestry-biased>Why is the Bayeux Tapestry biased?</h2>
<p>This was known as the Battle of Hastings. The Bayeux tapestry is a French depiction of the events leading up to the battle, and the battle itself. It clearly shows that William was the rightful king because it was a biased source (remember that William was French and the tapestry is French).</p>
<h2 id=what-can-we-learn-from-the-bayeux-tapestry>What can we learn from the Bayeux Tapestry?</h2>
<p>What can we learn from looking at the Bayeux Tapestry? It tells the story of the Norman invasion of England in 1066 through panels which depict scenes of battle and of daily life. Therefore, from looking at the pictures on the tapestry, we can out much about life during the time of the invasion.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-tapestry-biased>Why is the tapestry biased?</h2>
<p>The Bayeux tapestry is a French depiction of the events leading up to the battle, and the battle itself. It clearly shows that William was the rightful king because it was a biased source (remember that William was French and the tapestry is French).</p>
<h2 id=can-the-bayeux-tapestry-be-trusted>Can the Bayeux Tapestry be trusted?</h2>
<p>The tapestry is sometimes viewed as a type of chronicle. Because the tapestry was made within a generation of the Norman defeat of the Anglo-Saxons, it is considered to be a somewhat accurate representation of events. Based on a few key pieces of evidence, art historians believe the patron was Odo, Bishop of Bayeux.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-the-bayeux-tapestry>What is the purpose of the Bayeux Tapestry?</h2>
<p>The embroidery was displayed in Bayeux Cathedral on 14 July 1077, and has remained in Bayeux ever since. The primary purpose of the Bayeux Tapestry was to justify the Norman Conquest of England before God. In 58 scenes, it tells the story of the events surrounding this key event in Anglo-French history.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-in-the-first-scene-of-the-bayeux-tapestry>What happens in the first scene of the Bayeux Tapestry?</h2>
<p>It depicts Harold’ s journey to Normandy and relationship with Duke William in the years before the Battle of Hastings and ends with Harold’s death and the Norman victory. The tapestry provides a unique insight into the medieval weapons, customs and dress of soldiers in Medieval England. The first scene shows the journey to Normandy in 1064.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-tapestry-of-harold-and-william>Where is the tapestry of Harold and William?</h2>
<p>Commissioned in the 1070s, the embroidered cloth is more than 70 metres long and is on display at Bayeux in Normandy, France. It depicts Harold’ s journey to Normandy and relationship with Duke William in the years before the Battle of Hastings and ends with Harold’s death and the Norman victory.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-tapestry-of-the-battle-of-hastings>How big is the tapestry of the Battle of Hastings?</h2>
<p>The Bayeux Tapestry is an embroidery that illustrates the Battle of Hastings. Commissioned in the 1070s, the embroidered cloth is more than 70 metres long and is on display at Bayeux in Normandy, France.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-gesture-of-mourning-in-the-tapestry>What was the gesture of mourning in the tapestry?</h2>
<p>The Roman gesture for grief or mourning was touching the face, just as Edith does with her veiled hand at Edward’s deathbed. The tapestry was of course a contemporary document to the people of the 11th century displaying scenes of events that the viewers would have been familiar with and may even have taken part in.</p>
