<h2 id=what-is-a-underwater-volcano-called>What is a underwater volcano called?</h2>
<p>Submarine volcanoes are exactly what they sound like—volcanoes located beneath the ocean’s surface. Because they erupt into water instead of air, submarine volcanoes behave quite differently than terrestrial volcanoes.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-given-to-an-extinct-and-eroded-underwater-volcano>What is the name given to an extinct and eroded underwater volcano?</h2>
<p>Seamounts are typically formed from extinct volcanoes that rise abruptly and are usually found rising from the seafloor to 1,000–4,000 m (3,300–13,100 ft) in height. After they have subsided and sunk below the sea surface such flat-top seamounts are called “guyots” or “tablemounts”.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-extinct-shield-volcano>What is an extinct shield volcano?</h2>
<p>Active volcanoes have erupted recently. A dormant volcano isn’t erupting right now, but vulcanologists expect it could erupt at any time. Extinct volcanoes haven’t erupted for tens of thousands of years, and aren’t expected to erupt again.</p>
<h2 id=do-underwater-volcanoes-have-names>Do underwater volcanoes have names?</h2>
<p>A list of active and extinct submarine volcanoes and seamounts located under the world’s oceans. There are estimated to be 40,000 to 55,000 seamounts in the global oceans. This list is therefore confined to seamounts that are notable enough to have been named and/or explored.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-extinct-volcanoes-in-the-world>Where are the extinct volcanoes in the world?</h2>
<p>That part of the mountain was all rock and ice and it killed almost 17,000 people in small towns around the mountain. Mount Buninyong is large extinct volcano 15 kilometers south east of Ballarat Victoria, Australia. The 745 meter volcano is on the Western Victorian Volcanic Plains.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-volcanoes-active-dormant-or-extinct>How are volcanoes active, dormant, or extinct?</h2>
<p>Volcanoes can be active, dormant, or extinct. Active volcanoes are volcanoes that have had recent eruptions or are expected to have eruptions in the near future. Dormant volcanoes no longer produce eruptions, but might again sometime in the future. Extinct volcanoes will likely never erupt again. What Causes Volcanoes?</p>
<h2 id=how-many-underwater-volcanoes-are-there-in-the-world>How many underwater volcanoes are there in the world?</h2>
<p>There are thought to be an estimated ten million underwater volcanoes on Earth. Underwater volcanoes are also known as submarine volcanoes. Most underwater volcanoes are located along the borders of tectonic plates or mid-ocean ridges.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-magma-erupt-in-a-submarine-volcano>Where does magma erupt in a submarine volcano?</h2>
<p>Submarine volcanoes are underwater vents or fissures in the Earth’s surface from which magma can erupt. Many submarine volcanoes are located near areas of tectonic plate formation , known as mid-ocean ridges .</p>
