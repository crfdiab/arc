<p>Although Jews are represented at roughly the same level among Americans and new immigrants (1.4% and 1.3%, respectively), Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus are substantially over-represented compared with the U.S. population….Table 1.</p>

<h2 id=what-religion-were-most-irish-and-german-immigrants>What religion were most Irish and German immigrants?</h2>
<p>Roman Catholic<br>
All of the Irish and many of the Germans were Roman Catholic.</p>
<h2 id=what-culture-did-irish-immigrants-bring-to-america>What culture did Irish immigrants bring to America?</h2>
<p>The Irish immigrants who entered the United States from the sixteenth to twentieth centuries were changed by America, and also changed this nation. They and their descendants made incalculable contributions in politics, industry, organized labor, religion, literature, music, and art.</p>
<h2 id=what-religion-were-the-irish-before-christianity>What religion were the Irish before Christianity?</h2>
<p>Celts in pre-Christian Ireland were pagans and had gods and goddesses, but they converted to Christianity in the fourth century.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-majority-of-irish-immigrants-in-the-1840s>Who was the majority of Irish immigrants in the 1840s?</h2>
<p>Early in the century, the majority of Irish immigrants were single men. After the 1840s, the pattern shifted to families as a few family members came first and earned money to bring relatives later in a process known as chain migration.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-irish-catholic-church-in-america>Where was the first Irish Catholic Church in America?</h2>
<p>The state’s growing Irish Catholic population finally got its first church in 1829, Holy Trinity in Hartford. In the late 1840s, the slow trickle of Irish immigration turned into a flood after a fungus destroyed Ireland’s potato crop. The resulting famine killed a million people and sent another million fleeing overseas, many of them to America.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-irish-come-to-the-united-states>When did the Irish come to the United States?</h2>
<p>Between 1820 and 1860, the Irish constituted over one third of all immigrants to the United States. In the 1840s, they comprised nearly half of all immigrants to this nation. Interestingly, pre-famine immigrants from Ireland were predominately male, while in the famine years and their aftermath, entire families left the country.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-of-irish-descent-are-in-the-us>How many people of Irish descent are in the US?</h2>
<p>Census figures show an Irish population of 8.2 million in 1841, 6.6 million a decade later, and only 4.7 million in 1891. It is estimated that as many as 4.5 million Irish arrived in America between 1820 and 1930. Between 1820 and 1860, the Irish constituted over one third of all immigrants to the United States.</p>
