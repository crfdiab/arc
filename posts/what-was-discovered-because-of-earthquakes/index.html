<h2 id=what-was-discovered-because-of-earthquakes>What was discovered because of earthquakes?</h2>
<p>The first seismograph was invented in 132 A.D. by the Chinese astronomer and mathematician Chang Heng. He called it an “earthquake weathercock.” Each of the eight dragons had a bronze ball in its mouth. Whenever there was even a slight earth tremor, a mechanism inside the seismograph would open the mouth of one dragon.</p>
<h2 id=what-have-scientists-learned-from-earthquakes>What have scientists learned from earthquakes?</h2>
<p>By tracking seismic waves, scientists have learned what makes up the planet’s interior. P-waves slow down at the mantle core boundary, so we know the outer core is less rigid than the mantle. S-waves disappear at the mantle core boundary, so the outer core is liquid.</p>
<h2 id=who-invented-earthquake-detector>Who invented earthquake detector?</h2>
<p>Zhang Heng<br>
Then: replica of Zhang Heng’s seismographNearly 2,000 years ago, in 132, a Chinese scientist named Zhang Heng invented the world’s first seismograph, an instrument to detect earthquakes.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-we-keep-safe-from-earthquake>How do we keep safe from earthquake?</h2>
<p>Stay Safe During an Earthquake</p>
<ol>
<li>DROP down onto your hands and knees before the earthquake knocks you down.</li>
<li>COVER your head and neck (and your entire body if possible) underneath a sturdy table or desk.</li>
<li>HOLD ON to your shelter (or to your head and neck) until the shaking stops.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-can-scientists-tell-where-the-earthquake-happened>How can scientists tell where the earthquake happened?</h2>
<p>There is one magnitude for each earthquake. Scientists also talk about the intensity of shaking from an earthquake, and this varies depending on where you are during the earthquake. An example of a seismic wave with the P wave and S wave labeled. (Public domain.) How can scientists tell where the earthquake happened?</p>
<h2 id=when-did-scientists-find-out-about-the-stormquake>When did scientists find out about the stormquake?</h2>
<p>This satellite image obtained from NOAA/RAMMB, shows Tropical Storm Dorian as it approaches the Bahamas and Florida at 12:00 UTC on September 1, 2019. Scientists say they have discovered an earthquake-like event that can happen during a hurricane or other powerful ocean storms. They are calling it a “stormquake.”</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-an-earthquake-to-happen-in-california>What causes an earthquake to happen in California?</h2>
<p>When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth’s crust and cause the shaking that we feel. In California there are two plates – the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-the-earth-to-shake-when-there-is-an-earthquake>What causes the Earth to shake when there is an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Earthquake, any sudden shaking of the ground caused by the passage of seismic waves through Earth ’s rocks. Seismic waves are produced when some form of energy stored in Earth’s crust is suddenly released, usually when masses of rock straining against one another suddenly fracture and “slip.”</p>
