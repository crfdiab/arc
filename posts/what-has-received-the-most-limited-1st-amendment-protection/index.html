<h2 id=what-form-of-communication-is-limited-by-the-1st-amendment>What form of communication is limited by the 1st Amendment?</h2>
<p>Symbolic speech consists of nonverbal, nonwritten forms of communication, such as flag burning, wearing arm bands, and burning of draft cards. It is generally protected by the First Amendment unless it causes a specific, direct threat to another individual or public order.</p>

<h2 id=what-forms-of-media-are-allotted-the-most-protection-by-the-first-amendment>What forms of media are allotted the most protection by the First Amendment?</h2>
<p>Writing for himself and four other justices, Justice Scalia wrote that video games deserved full First Amendment protection: “Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas–and even social messages–through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue.</p>
<h2 id=should-the-1st-amendment-freedom-of-speech-extend-to-internet-communications>Should the 1st Amendment freedom of speech extend to Internet communications?</h2>
<p>The Court held that the regulation created a “chilling effect” on speech and prohibited more speech than necessary to achieve the objective of protecting children. Instead, the Court ruled that speech on the Internet should receive the highest level of First Amendment protection—like that extended to the print media.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-1st-amendment-apply-to-social-media>Does the 1st Amendment apply to social media?</h2>
<p>“The First Amendment applies to the government, and Twitter or Facebook, or any other social media platform, by and large, is a private sector actor and therefore the First Amendment does not apply.” The government is not stopping the president or anyone else for that matter,” Aughenbaugh said.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-violation-of-free-speech>What is a violation of free speech?</h2>
<p>Categories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment (and therefore may be restricted) include obscenity, fraud, child pornography, speech integral to illegal conduct, speech that incites imminent lawless action, speech that violates intellectual property law, true threats, and commercial …</p>
<h2 id=how-is-advertising-protected-by-the-first-amendment>How is advertising protected by the First Amendment?</h2>
<p>Advertising is indeed protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, advertising or “commercial speech” enjoys somewhat less First Amendment protection from governmental encroachment than other types of speech. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for example, may regulate speech that is found to be “deceptive.”</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-first-amendment-apply-to-the-electronic-media>How does the First Amendment apply to the electronic media?</h2>
<p>The First Amendment and the electronic media. The First Amendment’s seemingly simple command that “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press” becomes exceedingly complex in its application to electronic media.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-freedom-of-speech-protected-by-the-first-amendment>Is the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment?</h2>
<p>Advertising is indeed protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, advertising or “commercial speech” enjoys somewhat less First Amendment protection from governmental encroachment than other types of speech.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-federal-radio-commission-protected-by-the-first-amendment>Is the Federal Radio Commission protected by the First Amendment?</h2>
<p>Federal Radio Comm’n, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld against constitutional attack a Federal Radio Commission decision to revoke a radio station’s license. The FRC had argued in its brief to the court that broadcasting is not protected speech under the First Amendment.</p>
