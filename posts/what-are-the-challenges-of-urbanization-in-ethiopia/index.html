<h2 id=what-are-the-challenges-of-urbanization-in-ethiopia>What are the challenges of urbanization in Ethiopia?</h2>
<p>Five urbanisation challenges in Addis Ababa</p>
<ul>
<li>Sustainability of buildings and infrastructure. Addis Ababa is currently undergoing a massive construction boom.</li>
<li>Urban planning and integration.</li>
<li>The informal sector.</li>
<li>Environmental management.</li>
<li>Investment in human capital.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-problems-of-urban-centers-of-ethiopia>What are the major problems of urban centers of Ethiopia?</h2>
<p>Urban centres in Ethiopia are characterised by a variety of socio-economic problems, mainly poverty, the higher rate of dependency, unemployment, and illiteracy.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-challenges-of-urban-planning>What are the challenges of urban planning?</h2>
<p>3 Main Problems Faced in Urban Planning</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Individual Control or Small Parcels of Land:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arbitrary Political Boundaries:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Irregularity of Environmental Site:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heritage of Past Construction:</p>

<h2 id=anticipation-of-future-change-what-are-the-challenges-of-living-in-addis-ababa>Anticipation of Future Change: What are the challenges of living in Addis Ababa?</h2>
<p>Addis Ababa is urbanizing and growing at a rapid pace. The city faces potential shocks and stresses that could hinder it from achieving its development goals. These include urban flooding, fire, earthquakes, rapid urbanization, water scarcity, unemployment, and social vulnerability.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-reasons-for-poor-development-of-water-transport-in-ethiopia>What are the reasons for poor development of water transport in Ethiopia?</h2>
<p>Similar to many African countries, parts of Ethiopia face water shortages, poor sanitation, and a lack of access to clean water sources. Ethiopia is located in Africa’s Horn where drought and politics are two leading causes of water shortage.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-important-feature-of-urbanization>What is the most important feature of urbanization?</h2>
<p>The characteristics of urbanization include, structured facilities, residential, employment centre, communication network, infrastructural facilities, size, density of population, family, marriage, occupation, class extremes, social heterogeneity, social distance, system of interaction and mobility.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-urban-challenges>What are the major urban challenges?</h2>
<p>The poor sanitation, water problems, and living in high-risk areas like next to dumpsites leads to disease of all kinds. To make matters worse, people in these areas often do not have proper access to health care services, which makes the disease much harder to cure, and at times, they even lead to death.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-three-examples-of-physical-challenges-to-urbanization>What are three examples of physical challenges to urbanization?</h2>
<p>Some of the major health problems resulting from urbanization include poor nutrition, pollution-related health conditions and communicable diseases, poor sanitation and housing conditions, and related health conditions.</p>
<h2 id=is-addis-ababa-expensive-to-live-in>Is Addis Ababa expensive to live in?</h2>
<p>A single person estimated monthly costs are 740$ without rent. Addis Ababa is 47.79% less expensive than New York (without rent). Rent in Addis Ababa is, on average, 83.01% lower than in New York.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-challenges-of-urban-development-in-ethiopia>What are the challenges of urban development in Ethiopia?</h2>
<p>As part of policy intervention in addressing the challenges of urban development in the country, activities such as investment promotion, improvement of governmental services in land and infrastructure, job creation, and housing provisions have been carried out.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-author-of-urban-development-in-ethiopia>Who is the author of urban development in Ethiopia?</h2>
<p>Author’s Copy URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN ETHIOPIA: CHALLENGES AND POLICY RESPONSES – Samson Kassahun* and Alok Tiwari** Since 1991, Ethiopia’s record of economic growth has been very impressive. This paper critically examines the role of policies and institutions in addressing the developmental challenges of urban centres in Ethiopia.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-economic-development-strategy-of-ethiopia>What is the economic development strategy of Ethiopia?</h2>
<p>The comprehensive thrust of the Ethiopian government’s economic development policy and strategy basically presents four pillars of economic development: Agricultural Development Led Industrialisation (ADLI), justice system and civil service reform, decentralisation and empowerment, and capacity building in public and private sectors.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-challenges-in-the-urban-sector>What are the challenges in the urban sector?</h2>
<p>Some urban areas in the North have opposite challenges of negative growth after old industries have died out or left. Inequity and segregation seem to be common challenges to cities all over the world. Urban inequity and segregation are also an indication of global inequity.</p>
