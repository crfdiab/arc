<p>Waimea<br>
The Cook Landing Site in Waimea on Kauaʻi island in Hawaii, is where Captain James Cook landed at the mouth of the Waimea River on January 20, 1778. Cook was the first European reported to have sighted the Hawaiian Islands, and the January 20 landfall on southwestern Kauaʻi was his first arrival upon Hawaiian soil.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-captain-cook-arrive-in-hawaii>Why did Captain Cook arrive in Hawaii?</h2>
<p>British Captain James Cook arrived in the Islands on his third voyage to the Pacific. Commanding the Resolution and Discovery on a mission to explore a Northwest Passage and to plot the transit of Venus, Cook first sighted the islands of O’ahu, then Kaua’i and Ni’ihau on January 18, 1778.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-james-cook-named-hawaii-the-sandwich-islands>Why did James Cook named Hawaii the Sandwich Islands?</h2>
<p>He may have been the first European to ever visit the island group, which he named the Sandwich Islands in honor of one of his patrons, John Montague, the Earl of Sandwich. Cook and his crew were welcomed by the Hawaiians, who were fascinated by the Europeans’ ships and their use of iron.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-james-cook-arrive-in-the-pacific-northwest>When did James Cook arrive in the Pacific Northwest?</h2>
<p>James Cook, who led maritime expeditions to the Pacific Ocean three times between 1768 and 1779, is considered one of the world’s great explorers. Born in Yorkshire in 1728, he first went to sea in 1746 as an eighteen-year-old on a ship hauling coal.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-captain-james-cook-arrive-in-hawaii>When did Captain James Cook arrive in Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Captain Cook arrives in Hawai`i. British Captain James Cook arrived in the Islands on his third voyage to the Pacific.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-european-to-discover-hawaii>Who was the first European to discover Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Captain Cook discovers Hawaii. On January 18, 1778, the English explorer Captain James Cook becomes the first European to discover the Hawaiian Islands when he sails past the island of Oahu.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-cook-forced-to-return-to-hawaii>Why was Cook forced to return to Hawaii?</h2>
<p>After one of the crewmembers died, exposing the Europeans as mere mortals, relations became strained. On February 4, 1779, the British ships sailed from Kealakekua Bay, but rough seas damaged the foremast of the Resolution, and after only a week at sea the expedition was forced to return to Hawaii.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-cook-land-in-the-pacific-ocean>Where did Cook land in the Pacific Ocean?</h2>
<p>Crossing the Atlantic Ocean, they reached the Falkland Islands in January, 1786, and rounded Cape Horn to enter the Pacific Ocean. They reach­ed the Hawaiian Islands on 24 May, and anchored in Kealakekua Bay (where Cook had been killed seven years previously), but did not go ashore.</p>
