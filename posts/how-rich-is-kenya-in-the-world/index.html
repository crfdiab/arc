<h2 id=how-rich-is-kenya-in-the-world>How rich is Kenya in the world?</h2>
<p>Kenya, a country in East Africa well known for its vast landscapes and wildlife is next on Africa’s richest country list, having a GDP of almost $100 Billion.</p>
<h2 id=is-kenya-a-high-income-country>Is Kenya a high income country?</h2>
<p>Kenya is the economic, financial, and transport hub of East Africa. Kenya’s real GDP growth has averaged over 5% for the last decade. Since 2014, Kenya has been ranked as a lower middle income country because its per capita GDP crossed a World Bank threshold. Tourism also holds a significant place in Kenya’s economy.</p>
<h2 id=is-kenya-3rd-world>Is Kenya 3rd world?</h2>
<p>Yes, Kenya is a third world country. While the country has recently gotten lower-middle-income stature, not every Kenyan has benefited from the heightened wealth.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-majority-of-kenyans-poor-or-rich>Is the majority of Kenyans poor or rich?</h2>
<p>Most people in Kenya are poor but there are ruffly 45% of people living in Kenya who are rich. Is Nairobi a poor or rich country? In Kenya some parts are rich and some parts are poor! Charities in this counrty help places like Kenya.NAIROBI is a more rich part of Kenya Are Kenyans rich?</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-inequality-is-there-in-kenya>What kind of inequality is there in Kenya?</h2>
<p>Social inequality and poverty Kenya is a lower middle income unequal country and its inequality is mainly reflected in wealth distribution, poverty level and human rights aspects. Kenya’s inequality is reflected by share of income and social services varying among different segments of the population.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-live-below-the-poverty-line-in-kenya>How many people live below the poverty line in Kenya?</h2>
<p>However, this is not a satisfactory answer when looking for a solution to poverty in Kenya. Kenya has a population of 44 million, 42% of whom live below the poverty line. Certain qualities that those living in the United States consider basic, such as healthcare, education, clean water and sanitation, are luxuries for many living in Kenya.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-country-rich-or-poor-in-the-world>What makes a country rich or poor in the world?</h2>
<p>Different factors are directly responsible for the country’s ranking on the global scale of wealth and poverty. These factors include but are not limited to Gross Domestic Product per capita and relative purchasing power. Gross Domestic Product is the sum value of all goods and services produced in a state.</p>
