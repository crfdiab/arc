<h2 id=why-was-achilles-heel-the-only-place-he-was-vulnerable>Why was Achilles heel the only place he was vulnerable?</h2>
<p>When Achilles was a baby, his mother Thetis stuck him in a special flame to make him invulnerable. The interruption prevented Thetis from making her son completely invulnerable, which is why one of Achilles’ heels remained vulnerable.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-weakest-part-of-achilles-body-why>What was the weakest part of Achilles body Why?</h2>
<p>Achilles’ heel The ‘Achilles’ heel’ is one’s weak point, and is named for the only part of the body of the Greek hero Achilles which was vulnerable. The weakness of the heel, or more accurately the tendon, of Achilles derives from the story of the unsuccessful attempt by his mother Thetis to make Achilles invulnerable.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-achilles-die-from-his-heel>Why did Achilles die from his heel?</h2>
<p>In the myths surrounding the war, Achilles was said to have died from a wound to his heel, ankle, or torso, which was the result of an arrow—possibly poisoned—shot by Paris.</p>
<h2 id=are-patroclus-and-achilles-lovers>Are Patroclus and Achilles lovers?</h2>
<p>It is clear that Achilles and Patroclus had an incredibly deep, intimate bond. But nothing between them in the Iliad is explicitly romantic or sexual. Because many Greeks of the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, centuries later after the Iliad was written, did portray Achilles and Patroclus as lovers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-achilles-become-immortal>How did Achilles become immortal?</h2>
<p>Thetis gives birth to Achilles who, unlike her, is mortal. She attempts to make the baby Achilles immortal, by dipping him in the River Styx (the river that runs through the underworld), while holding him by his heel.</p>
<h2 id=did-achilles-have-a-child-with-briseis>Did Achilles have a child with Briseis?</h2>
<p>Despite rumors of his homosexual tendencies, Achilles did have a child—a son, born from a brief affair during the Trojan War. However, after Achilles entered the Trojan War, Briseis, the daughter of the Trojan priest of Apollo named Chryses, was given to Achilles as a war prize.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-thetis-hate-patroclus>Why did Thetis hate Patroclus?</h2>
<p>She hates Patroclus. Thetis tells 12 year old Achilles that she wishes to meet Patroclus. Patroclus is afraid because of her reputation for hating mortals. She tells him that Achilles will be a god, and asks him if he understands.</p>
<h2 id=did-achilles-know-he-had-a-weakness>Did Achilles know he had a weakness?</h2>
<p>Did Achilles know about his own vulnerability beforehand? – Quora. Yes, he did. When about sixteen years old, Achilles was summoned back to Phthia from the tutelage of Chiron. Achilles’ father, Peleus broke the news that Helen had been abducted by prince Paris of Troy.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-achilles-heel-given-its-name>Why was the Achilles heel given its name?</h2>
<p>Achilles was hit there by an arrow during the Trojan War, which is why he lost his life. This legend is the reason why the Achilles heel has become synonymous for a vulnerable spot and gave its name to the human Achilles tendon. 1 Klein, C.: Orthopädie für Patienten [Orthopaedics for Patients].</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-achilles-tendon-a-weak-spot>Why is the Achilles tendon a weak spot?</h2>
<p>Why the Achilles Tendon is a Weak Spot. With great responsibility, however, can come a lot of stress, and this makes the Achilles a common sufferer of trouble. One of the most common conditions is Achilles tendinitis, where excess stress or irritation upon the tendon can cause it to grow inflamed and painful.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-achilles-lose-his-life-in-the-trojan-war>Why did Achilles lose his life in the Trojan War?</h2>
<p>Many athletes know the Achilles tendon pain syndrome, so-called achillodynia. By the way: Achilles was a hero in ancient Greek mythology. He was considered invulnerable, but he did have one weak spot: his heel. Achilles was hit there by an arrow during the Trojan War, which is why he lost his life.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-mother-of-achilles-do-to-make-him-immortal>What did the mother of Achilles do to make him immortal?</h2>
<p>The myth about the Achilles’ heel was not always presented as the main weakness in his life. Achilles was the son of Thetis and Peleus, the bravest hero in the Trojan war, according to Greek mythology. When Achilles was born, his mother, Thetis, tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the River Styx.</p>
