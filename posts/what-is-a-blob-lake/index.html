<h2 id=how-do-you-blob-jump>How do you blob jump?</h2>

<h2 id=why-is-it-called-blob-storage>Why is it called blob storage?</h2>
<p>It allows users to store large amounts of unstructured data on Microsoft’s data storage platform. In this case, Blob stands for Binary Large Object, which includes objects such as images and multimedia files. These are known as unstructured data because they don’t follow any particular data model.</p>

<h2 id=how-does-the-water-blob-work>How does the water blob work?</h2>
<p>How Does It Work? To make an Ooho, a blob of water is frozen and immersed in a calcium chloride solution — this is what forms the gelatinous layer around the liquid. Then, the ball is bathed in brown algae extract to create a second, reinforcing layer. There are two ways to drink from an Ooho.</p>
