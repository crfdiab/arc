<p>The primary themes common to most codes of journalistic standards and ethics are the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Accuracy and standards for factual reporting.</li>
<li>Slander and libel considerations.</li>
<li>Harm limitation principle.</li>
<li>Standards and reputation.</li>
<li>Genres, ethics, and standards.</li>
<li>Relationship with freedom of the press.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=is-there-freedom-of-press-in-south-africa>Is there freedom of press in South Africa?</h2>
<p>Freedom of expression is one of the most fundamental human rights. Its importance is highlighted each year on May 3 – World Press Freedom Day. Once muzzled by an oppressive government, South African media freedom is today guaranteed by our progressive constitution.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-moral-dilemmas-that-communicators-and-journalist-face>What are the moral dilemmas that communicators and journalist face?</h2>
<p>Protecting Sources. To a journalist, sources are sacred.</p>
<ol start=8>
<li>Protecting Victims.</li>
<li>Privacy vs. News Value.</li>
<li>Conflicts of Interest.</li>
<li>Audience as Customer.
What is conflict of interest in journalism?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>A conflict of interest arises when someone who is expected to act impartially has a personal stake in an issue (emotional, financial, etc.). In every case, a conflict of interest is a real problem — even if nobody misbehaves.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-challenges-of-being-an-african-journalist>What are the challenges of being an African journalist?</h2>
<p>But African journalists work and talents shine against the odds, which include a lack of equipment, infrastructure, training, resources and a decent salary to make ends meet. More deeply rooted societal problems include poverty and corruption, and governments that try to control the media.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-be-a-journalist-in-south-africa>Is it safe to be a journalist in South Africa?</h2>
<p>Killing journalists and keeping some in jail threatens the safety of other journalists or media people worldwide. South Africa has moved past the era of apartheid but it is not an everyday situation where people feel free in their native land. The brutal assassination of journalists also happens in this country.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-challenges-to-media-freedom-in-south-africa>What are the challenges to media freedom in South Africa?</h2>
<p>Political interference, maladministration and self-censorship have had a crippling effect and have meant that the broadcaster is increasingly unable to deliver high quality programming and news that reflects a plurality of views, is fair, accurate and independent of government and commercial interests.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-future-of-journalism-going-to-be>How is the future of journalism going to be?</h2>
<p>News will have to go to readers; they don’t have to come to us. With Facebook and other social media providing new pathways to journalism, the modern audience doesn’t expect to work hard to “find” the news. Today’s digital journalists must be able to write, report and market their stories.</p>
