<h2 id=is-a-ria-submergent-or-emergent>Is a RIA Submergent or emergent?</h2>
<p>Submergent landforms are the opposite of emergent landforms. One submergent feature is a Ria. This is a river valley that’s been flooded by the eustatic rise in sea level.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-example-of-a-submergent-coastline>What is an example of a Submergent coastline?</h2>
<p>Notable and illustrative examples of submergent coastlines include: Western Norway, famed for its many fjords created by sea level rise at the end of the LGP. The Western Coastal Plains of the Indian subcontinent, which includes the estuaries of the Narmada and the Tapti Rivers.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-emergent-coast-mean>What does emergent coast mean?</h2>
<p>An emergent coastline is a stretch along the coast that has been exposed by the sea by a relative fall in sea levels by either isostasy or eustasy. Emergent coastline are the same of submergent coastlines, which have experienced a relative decrease in sea levels.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-coast-of-submergence>What is meant by coast of submergence?</h2>
<p>A submerged coast is defined as a coast resulting from the relative submergence of a landmass either through eustatic sea-level rise and/or crustal subsidence against subaerially produced forms and structures. The term carries no implication as to whether it is the land or the sea that has moved.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-an-emergent-coast>What causes an emergent coast?</h2>
<p>Emergent coasts occur where sea levels fall relative to land level. Submergent coasts occur where sea levels rise relative to land level. Tectonic shifts and sea level changes cause the long-term rise and fall of sea level relative to land.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-emergent-and-submergent-coastlines-examples>What are emergent and Submergent coastlines examples?</h2>
<p>Submergent coastlines display characteristics caused when sea level rises or the land sinks down. Emergent coastlines display characteristics caused when sea level drops or the land rises (from tectonic uplift). * Wave cut platforms and elevated marine terraces. Example: West Coast California (Figure 12.26).</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-emergent-coast>What causes emergent Coast?</h2>
<p>Emergent coasts are a result of local tectonic uplift of the land surface or a fall in the elevation of sea level because of a reduction in the water volume of ocean basins. A very good example of an emergent coastline, because of its proximity to an active plate tectonic margin, is the west coast of North America.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-you-able-to-tell-if-a-beach-is-emergent>How are you able to tell if a beach is emergent?</h2>
<p>Emergent coastlines display characteristics caused when sea level drops or the land rises (from tectonic uplift). * Wave cut platforms and elevated marine terraces. There areas are called emergent coasts and display features including sea cliffs and marine terraces (see below).</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-emergent-coast-1>What causes emergent coast?</h2>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-an-emergent-and-a-submergent-coastline>What’s the difference between an emergent and a submergent coastline?</h2>
<p>An emergent coastline is a stretch along the coast that has been exposed by the sea by a relative fall in sea levels by either isostasy or eustasy. Emergent coastline are the opposite of submergent coastlines, which have experienced a relative rise in sea levels.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-submergent-and-emergent-landforms-change>Why do submergent and emergent landforms change?</h2>
<p>1. Submergent & Emergent Landforms 2. Why does sea level change? 3. Eustatic change • The change in the amount of water in the sea. – During an Ice Age there is less water in the ocean as much precipitation falls as snow and joins the ice on the land. Therefore sea level falls.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-east-coast-called-an-emergent-coast>Why is the east coast called an emergent coast?</h2>
<p>The east coast is called emergent coast because the coast has been exposed by the sea by a relative fall in sea levels. East coast sea is not very deep when compared to west coast hence the number of ports are less on this coast .</p>
<h2 id=how-are-emergent-coastlines-produced-by-post-glacial-adjustment>How are emergent coastlines produced by post-glacial adjustment?</h2>
<p>Emergent coastlines are being produced by post-glacial adjustment. These are parts of the littoral zone where a fall in sea level exposed land once part of the sea bed. They have landforms reflecting the previous sea levels. Raised beach A relict beach now above high tide level.</p>
