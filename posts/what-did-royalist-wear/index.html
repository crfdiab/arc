<p>Cavalrymen would be protected by a thick buff-leather coat that could turn a sword cut, and/or a back and breastplate. They would usually wear a helmet, often of the distinctive ‘lobster pot’ type. Dragoons were mounted infantrymen who rode small horses or cobs to move into position and then fought on foot.</p>

<p>Soldiers wore a jerkin of buffalo hide – known as a buff coat – over their clothing. This would have given some protection against a glancing blow from a sword but not a lot else. Pikemen were also issued with a set of armour, which consisted of a corselet (a back and breast plate) and tassets (thigh guards).</p>

<p>My old mate, Oliver Cromwell said “give me a russet coated captain who knows for what he fights! “ Identification was often as basic as a piece of ribbon or a sprig of some plant or other worn on the clothing.

Here we reveal the dress code the royals aim to follow.</p>

<p>Royal Clothing of a Princess. The royal clothing of a Princess, much like that of a Queen, was made from the best materials available in the period. Not only silk and fur were used in the manufacture of main pieces of the dress such as the gowns and tunics, other rich embellishments were also used such as gold laces, jewels and pearls on the dress.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-royalists-wear-orange-and-red>Why did the Royalists wear orange and red?</h2>
<p>These were normally red for the Royalists, tawny orange for the Parliamentarians. An army might adopt a ‘field sign’ to distinguish its soldiers – maybe a bit of greenery stuck in the hat – and was usually given a ‘field word’ – a simple phrase to shout out as a kind of password.</p>
