<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-there-is-little-water>What is it called when there is little water?</h2>
<p>Dehydration is the term for your body’s reaction when you don’t drink enough water, resulting in a fluid deficiency. Chronic dehydration is a condition when dehydration recurs for longer periods, sometimes regardless of how much fluid you take in on a particular day.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a-drought-look-like>What does a drought look like?</h2>
<p>When some places are in a drought, they may be dry, hot and dusty; cracks may appear in the soil, and rivers, lakes, streams, and other sources of water may go dry. Other places in drought get some rain, but not as much as they usually receive during that season.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-there-is-too-little-or-too-much-rain>What happens when there is too little or too much rain?</h2>
<p>It can also lead to a rise of the groundwater table and an undesirable saturation of the rootzone. Too little water during the growing season causes the plants to wilt. Long periods during which the water supply is insufficient, result in loss of yield or even crop failure.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-its-raining-in-english>What does it mean when it’s raining in English?</h2>
<p>Rain falls from the clouds. Though we don’t say, “ rain is falling ,” English speakers understand that this is the movement of rain. In this context, the phrasal verb come down means fall from the sky in very large amounts. Don’t say “ The rain is really falling down .” Don’t say “ it’s raining cats and dogs ,” either.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-water-levels-when-there-is-no-rain>What happens to water levels when there is no rain?</h2>
<p>The flow of water in streams and rivers declines and water levels in lakes and reservoirs drop if rainfall does not replenish these resources. Low water levels in reservoirs mean less water is available to the public water systems for which they store water.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-its-raining-on-and-off-all-day>What does it mean when it’s raining on and off all day?</h2>
<p>“It’s drizzling.” Drizzling is more than spitting, less than raining. “It’s been raining on and off all day.” On and off means starting & stopping, then starting again over a period of time. “It’s pouring.” Pouring is very heavy rain. “ It is pouring rain outside! ” “ It’s raining, it’s pouring, the old man is snoring! ” 3.</p>
