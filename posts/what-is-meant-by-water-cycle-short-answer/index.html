<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-water-cycle-short-answer>What is meant by water cycle short answer?</h2>
<p>The water cycle is the path that all water follows as it moves around Earth in different states. Water vapor—a gas—is found in Earth’s atmosphere. Water can be found all over Earth in the ocean, on land and in the atmosphere. The water cycle is the path that all water follows as it moves around our planet.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-water-cycle-for-class-3rd>What is water cycle for class 3rd?</h2>
<p>A simple science lesson and fun water cycle video for kids in 3rd, 4th and 5th grade! The water cycle is the process of water moving around between the air and land. Or in more scientific terms: the water cycle is the process of water evaporating and condensing on planet Earth in a continuous process.</p>

<h2 id=what-do-you-know-about-the-hydrologic-cycle>What do you know about the hydrologic cycle?</h2>
<p>You’ve likely heard of the hydrologic (water) cycle before and know that it describes how Earth’s water journeys from the land to the sky, and back again. But what you may not know is why this process is so essential.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-water-cycle-in-the-atmosphere>How is the water cycle in the atmosphere?</h2>
<p>The continuous cycle in which water changes from water vapor in the atmosphere to liquid water through condensation and precipitation and then back to water vapor through evaporation, transpiration, and respiration. The water cycle is the circulation of water from the land to the air and back again.</p>
