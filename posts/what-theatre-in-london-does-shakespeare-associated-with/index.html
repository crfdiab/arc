<p>So they dismantled The Theatre, transported it’s timbers across the river Thames and used them to construct a new theatre which became known as The Globe. One of the most iconic theatres in London, Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre, which opened in 1997, is a reconstruction of the original built in 1599.</p>

<p>The Globe Theatre<br>
The Globe Theatre you see today in London is the third Globe. The first opened in 1599 and was built by the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, the company that William Shakespeare wrote for and part-owned. We think that the first play Shakespeare wrote for the original Globe was Julius Caesar in spring 1599.</p>

<p>It seems that Shakespeare lived a simple life in London. While he owned at least one house there he did not maintain a London household but lived in lodgings with landlords and other lodgers. He was always within walking distance of the theatre zone so we can imagine him walking to work every day.</p>

<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-two-most-famous-theatres-with-which-shakespeare-was-associated>What are the names of the two most famous theatres with which Shakespeare was associated?</h2>
<p>Thousands of performances of William Shakespeare’s plays have been staged since the end of the 16th century. While Shakespeare was alive, many of his greatest plays were performed by the Lord Chamberlain’s Men and King’s Men acting companies at the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres.</p>

<p>Working together, the actors built the new theatre as quickly as they could. By May 1599, the new theatre was ready to be opened. Burbage named it the Globe after the figure of Hercules carrying the globe on his back – for in like manner the actors carried the Globe’s framework on their backs across the Thames.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-shakespeares-theatre-in-london>What was the name of Shakespeare’s Theatre in London?</h2>
<p>North of the city was the Curtain theatre, home to England’s most famous actor Richard Burbage. Across the river was the competition, built by Philip Henslowe a businessman with a cash flow problem, the Rose. Shakespeare was one of four actors who bought a share in the Globe.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-william-shakespeare-work-as-an-actor>Where did William Shakespeare work as an actor?</h2>
<p>William Shakespeare worked with the Lord Chamberlain’s Men. Shakespeare performed with Lord Chamberlain’s Men at the Globe Theater in London from about 1595 to 1603, when they were named the King’s Men after the death of Queen Elizabeth when James I took over the company. An acting company is a group of players who work together to put on plays.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-shakespeare-live-when-he-moved-to-london>Where did Shakespeare Live when he moved to London?</h2>
<p>His move may have coincided with the closure of the Theatre in Shoreditch and the opening of the Globe on Bankside. Shakespeare is named in the 1599 lease for the Globe, the new playhouse built by the Lord Chamberlain’s Men from the dismantled timbers of the Theatre.</p>
