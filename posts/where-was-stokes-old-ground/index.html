<p>June 1997<br>
Victoria Ground/Demolished</p>
<p>The Victoria Ground was demolished in June 1997 and the site stood empty for over 20-years until a housing development was built in 2019 named Victoria Park with the streets named after former Stoke players and managers.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-stoke-city-move-to-the-britannia-stadium>When did Stoke City move to the Britannia Stadium?</h2>
<p>1997–98<br>
1997–98 saw Stoke move to its new ground, the Britannia Stadium, after 119 years at the Victoria Ground. Chic Bates, Macari’s assistant, was appointed manager for the club’s first season in the new ground. He did not last long though, and was replaced by Chris Kamara in January 1998.</p>

<h2 id=could-they-do-it-on-a-cold-night-in-stoke>Could they do it on a cold night in Stoke?</h2>
<p>Originally Answered: What’s the meaning of ‘but can he/she do it on a cold night in Stoke’ ? It’s asking whether a feat can be repeated, any time, anywhere. For example. An athletic sharpshooter is looking for sponsorship to make it to the Olympics.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-stoke-stadium-called-the-stoke-ground>Why is Stoke Stadium called the Stoke ground?</h2>
<p>In European competitions it is known as the Stoke ground due to UEFA regulations on sponsorships. The all-seater stadium cost nearly £15 million to build and brought the club up to standards with the Taylor Report of January 1990 to end 115 years at the Victoria Ground.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-stoke-city-move-to-britannia-stadium>When did Stoke City move to Britannia Stadium?</h2>
<p>Stoke City (1878–1997) The Victoria Ground was the home ground of Stoke City from 1878 until 1997, when the club relocated to the Britannia Stadium after 119 years. At the time of its demolition it was the oldest operational football league ground in the Football League.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-stoke-city-play-their-home-games>Where does Stoke City play their home games?</h2>
<p>Stoke’s home ground is the 30,089 all-seater, bet365 Stadium. Before the stadium was opened in 1997, the club was based at the Victoria Ground, which had been their home ground since 1878.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-stoke-city-stadium-named-after-bet365>Why was Stoke City Stadium named after Bet365?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately The Britannia Building Society has now gone bust, but Stoke City did keep the name of the ground due to fan pressure. As of 2016 the ground is now named after sponsors Bet365, the international bookie began life in Stoke and still has offices based there employing a lot of local people.</p>
