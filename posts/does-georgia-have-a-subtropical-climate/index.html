<h2 id=does-georgia-have-a-subtropical-climate>Does Georgia have a subtropical climate?</h2>
<p>The climate of Georgia is a humid subtropical climate, with most of the state having short, mild winters and long, hot summers. The Atlantic Ocean on the east coast of Georgia and the hill country in the north impact the state’s climate.</p>
<h2 id=does-georgia-have-a-humid-subtropical-climate>Does Georgia have a humid subtropical climate?</h2>
<p>An Overview of Georgia’s Climate Georgia falls into the same climate classification category, humid subtropical, as most of the southeastern United States. This climate type features mild winters, comfortable spring and autumn temperatures, but long, hot and steamy summers.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-climate-of-the-country-of-georgia>What is the climate of the country of Georgia?</h2>
<p>The climate of Georgia is mild and rainy on the coast and in the western plain, while it is more continental and arid in the central and eastern inland areas. In the mountains, it is obviously colder.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-georgia-so-humid>Why is Georgia so humid?</h2>
<p>Because of its close proximity to large bodies of water (the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean). Wind passing over those bodies of water brings in warm moist air which to an extent gets trapped against the Appalachian Mountain range resulting in regular rainfall which helps to create the higher humidity.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-climate-does-eastern-georgia-have>What kind of climate does eastern Georgia have?</h2>
<p>Eastern Georgia has a transitional climate from humid subtropical to continental. The region’s weather patterns are influenced both by dry, Caspian air masses from the east and humid, Black Sea air masses from the west.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-climate-in-georgia-affected-by-the-black-sea>How is the climate in Georgia affected by the Black Sea?</h2>
<p>Georgia’s climate is affected by subtropical influences from the west and continental influences from the east. The Greater Caucasus range moderates local climate by serving as a barrier against cold air from the north. Warm, moist air from the Black Sea moves easily into the coastal lowlands from the west.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-weather-in-georgia-compared-to-other-states>How is the weather in Georgia compared to other states?</h2>
<p>This is warmer than most of the U.S. states. Georgia has 52.8 days annually when the high temperature is over 90°, which is hotter than most states in the U.S. Georgia has 47.7 days annually when the nighttime low temperature falls below freezing, which is warmer than most states in the U.S.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-wettest-season-of-the-year-in-georgia>Which is the wettest season of the year in Georgia?</h2>
<p>The wettest season is Autumn with 28% of yearly precipitation and 22% occurs in Winter, which is the driest season. Georgia’s average annual rainfall of 50.1 inches indicates that it is wetter than most states in the United States.</p>
