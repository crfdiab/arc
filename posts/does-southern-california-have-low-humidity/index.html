<h2 id=does-southern-california-have-low-humidity>Does Southern California have low humidity?</h2>
<p>Many parts of Southern California experienced extremely low relative humidity levels, including a low of 2 percent in Burbank, according to David Gomberg, meteorologist with NWS Los Angeles. LAX saw a relative humidity level of 5 percent that was influenced by offshore winds, Gomberg said.</p>
<h2 id=is-northern-california-dry-or-humid>Is Northern California dry or humid?</h2>
<p>California is a Mediterranean climate and typically experiences dry summers and wet winters. But not this year. The heat index, a measurement of how hot it feels when relative humidity is added to the actual temperature outside, has reached dangerously high levels.</p>

<p>Finally, the California Current. AND, because the California Current is so cold, relatively little of the water evaporates, so we have less humidity, so even when LA DOES hit the 90s or even triple digits (rare, but it happens), humidity usually doesn’t get much above 40%, and is usually less.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-humid-city-in-the-us>What is the most humid city in the US?</h2>
<p>New Orleans<br>
New Orleans has the highest relative humidity among big US cities, with an average of nearly 86 percent. The Louisiana city is followed closely by second-ranked Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<h2 id=which-state-has-most-humid-summers>Which state has most humid summers?</h2>
<p>Alaska<br>
The most humid state, however, is Alaska. This is is because, with relative humidity, humidity is expressed as a percentage of the maximum amount of water that air can hold at a given temperature.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-humidity-level-in-california>What is the average humidity level in California?</h2>
<p>The average humidity year round is listed below for places in California. The tables give daily averages along with highest and lowest relative humidity levels. Relative humidity measures the actual amount of moisture in the air as a percentage of the maximum amount of moisture the air can hold.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-best-places-to-live-with-low-humidity>Where are the best places to live with low humidity?</h2>
<p>Hartford, Connecticut According to Current Results, Hartford is one of the cities on the Northeastern side of the country that has the lowest humidity. While there are places in the desert southwest that can top this, it’s one of the drier places on the Eastern Seaboard.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-state-for-a-low-humidity-retirement>Which is the best state for a low humidity retirement?</h2>
<p>Here are the four best states for a low-humidity retirement. 1. Nevada Not surprisingly, a state known for its desert climate is a place with low humidity. Las Vegas is one of the least humid cities in the U.S. and home to 23 of Nevada’s 34 active adult communities.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-least-humid-state-in-the-united-states>Which is the least humid state in the United States?</h2>
<p>While Albuquerque and Santa Fe made the list of the 100 least-humid cities in the U.S., the state partially taxes Social Security, pensions, and other retirement income. However, for active adults who want to enjoy the 250 sunny days a year, low cost of living, and millions of acres of recreational land, New Mexico provides a great place to retire.</p>
