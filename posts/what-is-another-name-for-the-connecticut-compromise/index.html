<h2 id=what-is-another-name-for-the-connecticut-compromise>What is another name for the Connecticut Compromise?</h2>
<p>Connecticut Compromise, also known as Great Compromise, in United States history, the compromise offered by Connecticut delegates Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth during the drafting of the Constitution of the United States at the 1787 convention to solve the dispute between small and large states over representation …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-focus-of-the-great-compromise>What was the main focus of the Great Compromise?</h2>
<p>The Great Compromise of 1787 gave larger states representation in the lower house according to population, and the smaller states attained equal representation in the upper house.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-authors-of-the-connecticut-compromise>Who are the authors of the Connecticut Compromise?</h2>
<p>Authors of the Compromise. This agreement is called the Connecticut Compromise because it was proposed by two representatives from the state of Connecticut: Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth. Rising from relatively modest means, Roger Sherman eventually became a lawyer and major landowner in Connecticut.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-connecticut-compromise-change-the-constitution>How did the Connecticut Compromise change the Constitution?</h2>
<p>The Connecticut Compromise barely passed through the Constitutional Congress with only a one-vote margin. But by ending the gridlock between small states and large states, the Connecticut Compromise paved the way for the Constitution to be formed. Indeed, without it, the United States Constitution may never have been adopted.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-connecticut-compromise-important-to-sherman>Why was the Connecticut Compromise important to Sherman?</h2>
<p>Sherman knew that the ratification of the Constitution was dependent on a nationwide agreement on the selection process of State representatives. The Articles of Confederation allowed for smaller states to retain equal power and bearing as larger states, whereas prior to the Connecticut Compromise respective population size was not a consideration.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-saving-grace-of-the-connecticut-compromise>What was the saving grace of the Connecticut Compromise?</h2>
<p>The representatives, who had been working for seven weeks in the hot summer, almost had everything that they had been working on completely unraveled due to the stalemate between states. The saving grace that helped preserve the Constitution was the Connecticut Compromise, also referred to as the Great Compromise.</p>
