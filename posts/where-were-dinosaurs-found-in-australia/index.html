<h2 id=where-were-dinosaurs-found-in-australia>Where were dinosaurs found in Australia?</h2>
<p>Researchers excavate at the 2007 “Cooper” dinosaur dig site near Eromanga, in Australia’s Outback. The dinosaur was found near the town of Eromanga in southwest Queensland in Australia’s rural Outback. Researchers nicknamed it Cooper after the area near where it was found, Cooper Creek.</p>

<p>western North America<br>
Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-most-of-the-dinosaurs-in-australia-come-from>Where did most of the dinosaurs in Australia come from?</h2>
<p>Australian dinosaurs are known mostly from fragmentary fossils, although these show that Australia had a unique and diverse range of dinosaurs. Most Australian dinosaurs come from the eastern half of Australia (Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria) although isolated dinosaur bones have been found in Western Australia and South Australia.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-dinosaurs-live-in-the-tropics>Where did dinosaurs live in the tropics?</h2>
<p>Though about a third of Australia now lies within the tropics, back then the continent sat about 2,000 miles south of its current position, snuggled against Antarctica. Southeastern Australia probably had a climate similar to that of Chicago, if not Fairbanks. All the more surprising, then, that dinosaurs thrived here at that time.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-dinosaur-was-found-in-antarctica>What kind of dinosaur was found in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>This is a list of dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from Australia or Antarctica . The first non-avian dinosaur found in Antarctica, but not the first named. Named after the Atlas Copco company for funding the dig that found its fossils. The most complete predatory dinosaur found in Australia. A sauropod.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-dinosaurs-preserved-in-new-south-wales>How are dinosaurs preserved in New South Wales?</h2>
<p>Dinosaur bones from Lightning Ridge in New South Wales have been uniquely preserved in opal, generally as casts of the original bone. Trackways – the preserved footprints of dinosaurs and other species – can help fill the gaps in the fossil record when body fossils are rare.</p>
