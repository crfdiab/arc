<h2 id=how-does-earth-affect-the-solar-system>How does Earth affect the solar system?</h2>
<p>The Earth acting together with the Sun has them in control. There are also Trojan-type asteroids that orbit around the Lagrange points of the planet-Sun system, points selected by the combined gravity if the planet and Sun.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-earth-importance>What is the Earth importance?</h2>
<p>Earth is our home. We rely upon it for our existence in many different ways. Its resources feed us and provide the materials of our way of life. Even modest changes to Earth’s systems have had profound influences on human societies and the course of civilization.</p>
<h2 id=is-earth-the-most-important-planet-in-the-solar-system>Is Earth the most important planet in the solar system?</h2>
<p>Earth-like world could be ‘most important planet found outside solar system’ Astronomers spotted the planet as it moved across the face of a red dwarf star only a fifth the size of the sun. Though much cooler and fainter than the sun, GJ 1132b orbits so close to its star that surface temperatures reach 260C.</p>
<h2 id=what-planet-is-most-important>What planet is most important?</h2>
<p>Today’s astronomers acknowledge Jupiter as being perhaps the most important planet of the Solar System. It is the largest and most massive. After the Sun-the star about which all bodies of the Solar System revolve -Jupiter contains two-thirds of the matter in the Solar System.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-solar-energy-so-important-to-life-on-earth>Why is solar energy so important to life on Earth?</h2>
<p>It helps to grow our crops in order to provide food, supports the habitats of many living creatures and also provides light and warmth, helping us to see and stay warm. To sum up, solar energy is essential in helping to support life on earth.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-for-nasa-to-study-earth>Why is it important for NASA to study Earth?</h2>
<p>NASA studies Earth because Earth is a planet, too! In fact, it is the planet that NASA has studied the most. It is important to study Earth because it is the one place in the entire solar system where humans can live.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-earth-special-in-the-solar-system>What makes the Earth special in the Solar System?</h2>
<p>Kid-Friendly Earth Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. Water covers 70 percent of Earth’s surface. Earth’s atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-important-star-in-our-solar-system>Which is the most important star in our Solar System?</h2>
<p>The Sun is our closest star and is very important for life on Earth as it provides us with light and heat. The Sun is located at the very centre of our solar system. The Earth and other planets all orbit around the Sun, held in orbit by the force of gravity.</p>
