<p>Map of France showing Normandy, the region given to Rollo by Charles the Simple. In 911, a Viking leader named Rollo, who had been based by the estuary of the River Seine close to Rouen in France for about a decade, launched an unsuccessful raid on Paris.

<h2 id=why-was-normandy-important-in-the-hundred-years-war>Why was Normandy important in the Hundred Years War?</h2>
<p>The region was badly damaged during the Hundred Years War and the Wars of Religion, the Normans having more converts to Protestantism than other peoples of France. In the 20th century, D-Day, the 1944 Allied invasion of Western Europe, started in Normandy.</p>
