<h2 id=did-nixon-support-the-environmental-movement>Did Nixon support the environmental movement?</h2>
<p>Initially environmentalists’ instincts were sound. But Nixon also recognized the huge political power of environmentalism, which blossomed into a popular movement just around the time of his election. He had picked as his top domestic adviser John Ehrlichman, who believed in safeguarding natural resources.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-countries-did-president-nixon-try-to-normalize>What two countries did President Nixon try to normalize?</h2>
<p>U.S. President Richard Nixon’s 1972 visit to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was an important strategic and diplomatic overture that marked the culmination of the Nixon administration’s resumption of harmonious relations between the United States and mainland China after years of diplomatic isolation.</p>
<h2 id=in-what-ways-did-president-nixon-reduce-cold-war-tensions>In what ways did President Nixon reduce Cold War tensions?</h2>
<p>The Nixon administration promoted greater dialogue with the Soviet government, including regular summit meetings and negotiations over arms control and other bilateral agreements. Détente was known in Russian as разрядка (razryadka), loosely meaning “relaxation of tension”.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-richard-nixon-important-in-the-cold-war>Why is Richard Nixon important in the Cold War?</h2>
<p>Nixon focused on reducing the dangers of the Cold War among the Soviet Union and China. His policy sought on détente with both nations, which were hostile to the U.S. and to each other. He moved away from the traditional American policy of containment of Communism, hoping each side would seek American favor.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-conflict-in-the-middle-east>What was the conflict in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>October 6 marked the beginning of the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East, which witnessed Syria and Egypt attack Israel. Nixon refused to allow the nation to collapse under the pressure of Syria and Egypt. He therefore authorized Operation Nickel Grass to deliver economic and military aid to Israel.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-middle-east-affect-the-us-economy>How did the Middle East affect the US economy?</h2>
<p>One of the main culprits responsible for the inert American economy was oil production in the Middle East. The United States had reached its peak of domestic oil production around 1970. The decade that followed witnessed a dramatic decrease in domestic oil production, yet oil consumption continued to rise.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-oil-embargo-start-in-the-middle-east>When did the oil embargo start in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>This led to a significant increase in the cost of a barrel of oil for the United States. The largest economic setback for the United States came in 1973. October 6 marked the beginning of the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East, which witnessed Syria and Egypt attack Israel.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-oil-production-peak-in-the-middle-east>When did oil production peak in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter all attempted to remedy the daunting economic conditions of the decade, but they were all largely unsuccessful. One of the main culprits responsible for the inert American economy was oil production in the Middle East. The United States had reached its peak of domestic oil production around 1970.</p>
