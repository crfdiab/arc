<h2 id=when-was-ellis-island-turned-into-a-museum>When was Ellis Island turned into a museum?</h2>
<p>The site became part of the National Park System by <a href=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/presidential-proclamation-restricting-travel-from-southern-africa.html>Presidential Proclamation</a> in 1965, and was reopened to the public in 1990 as the country’s primary museum devoted entirely to immigration. Where were immigrants processed before Ellis Island opened?</p>
<h2 id=what-was-located-on-ellis-island-in-1776>What was located on Ellis Island in 1776?</h2>
<p>The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island From 1900-14, during the peak years of its operation, some 5,000 to 10,000 people passed through every day. Looming above New York Harbor nearby, the Statue of Liberty provided a majestic welcome to those passing through Ellis Island.</p>
<h2 id=who-went-to-ellis-island-first>Who went to Ellis Island first?</h2>
<p>Annie Moore<br>
Trivia. On January 1, 1892, teenager Annie Moore from County Cork, Ireland, became the first person admitted to the new immigration station on Ellis Island. On that opening day, she received a greeting from officials and a $10.00 gold piece.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-ellis-island-museum-a-living-monument>Is the Ellis Island Museum a living monument?</h2>
<p>The Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration is a living monument to the story of the American people. Housed inside the restored Main Building of the former immigration complex, the Museum documents the rich story of American immigration through a carefully curated collection of photographs, heirlooms, and searchable historic records.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-ellis-island-open-as-an-immigration-station>When did Ellis Island Open as an immigration station?</h2>
<p>Trivia Ellis Island is a historical site that opened in 1892 as an immigration station, a purpose it served for more than 60 years until it closed in 1954. Located at the mouth of Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, Ellis Island saw millions of newly arrived immigrants pass through its doors.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-statue-of-liberty-ellis-island-open-to-the-public>Is the Statue of Liberty Ellis Island open to the public?</h2>
<p>Today, it is part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, accessible to the public only by ferry. The north side of the island is the site of the main building, now a national museum of immigration. The south side of the island, including the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital, is only open to the public through guided tours.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-new-ellis-island-building-built>When was the new Ellis Island building built?</h2>
<p>The U.S. Treasury quickly ordered the immigration facility be rebuilt, under one very important condition: all future structures built on Ellis Island had to be fireproof. On December 17, 1900, the new Main Building was opened and 2,251 immigrants were received that day.</p>
