<h2 id=what-states-does-the-platte-river-run-through>What states does the Platte River run through?</h2>
<p>The North Platte River is a major tributary of the Platte River and is approximately 716 miles (1,152 km) long, counting its many curves. In a straight line, it travels about 550 miles (890 km), along its course through the U.S. states of Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska.</p>
<h2 id=how-wide-is-platte-river>How wide is Platte River?</h2>
<p>Today, by the time the North Platte reaches Paxton, Nebraska it is much smaller due to the extensive water taken from it for irrigation. Historically, the North Platte River was up to a mile wide (1.6 km) in many places, as evinced by the old streambed and historic written records.</p>

<p>Missouri River<br>
Platte River/Mouths</p>
<p>The Platte flows southeast into a big bend at Kearney, curves northeast, and travels east, south, and east again before emptying into the Missouri River at Plattsmouth, about 20 miles (32 km) south of Omaha.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-platte-river-polluted>Is the Platte River polluted?</h2>
<p>Sampling of South Platte River water by state inspectors found E. coli levels exceeding the federal recreational safety limit of 126 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters (cfu). The river contamination in 2018 reached as high as 17,300 cfu.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-swim-in-the-platte-river>Can you swim in the Platte River?</h2>
<p>Sections of the North Fork South Platte River are ideal for swimming, in particular at the confluence of the North and South forks at the boulders near the remains of the South Platte Hotel. Stop off at Eldorado Springs, an artesian-fed swimming pool at the mouth of the canyon.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-swim-in-rivers>Is it safe to swim in rivers?</h2>
<p>There are few things more refreshing than taking a relaxing dip into a freshwater stream, river or lake. Concerns about currents, pollution and wildlife often deter people from swimming in natural bodies of water, like streams and lakes. Thankfully, it’s perfectly safe to swim in most bodies of fresh water.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-platte-river-in-nebraska>How long is the Platte River in Nebraska?</h2>
<p>See Article History. Platte River, river of Nebraska, U.S., formed at the city of North Platte by the confluence of the North Platte and South Platte rivers. The Platte proper is 310 miles (500 km) long, but measured from its source stream, Grizzly Creek in Colorado (via the North Platte River), the system has a length of 990 miles (1,590 km).</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-mouth-of-the-platte-river>Where is the mouth of the Platte River?</h2>
<p>⁃ coordinates. The Platte River is located in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Its mouth is located in Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and much of the rest is in the Pere Marquette State Forest.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-a-float-trip-on-the-platte-river>How long is a float trip on the Platte River?</h2>
<p>Vary your trip length by choosing from one of these launch points: Launching your Platte River tubing trip from the fishing weir results in a 2.5 to 3.5-hour float trip. To access the boat launch, you have to carry your tubes, kayaks, etc down a gravel access road (shoes needed!) The walk to the weir takes 5-10 minutes.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-watershed-of-the-platte-river>How big is the watershed of the Platte River?</h2>
<p>The Platte River is about 29.5 miles (47.5 km) in length from its origin at the outlet of Lake Dubonnet. The watershed area is about 193 square miles (500 km 2 ). The land coverage is 82% forested, open lands or wetlands; 12% agriculture, and 7% urban. Approximately three-quarters of the watershed is publicly owned lands.</p>
