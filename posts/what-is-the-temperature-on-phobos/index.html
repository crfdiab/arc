<h2 id=what-is-the-temperature-on-phobos>What is the temperature on Phobos?</h2>
<p>High temperatures for Phobos were measured at 25 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 degrees Celsius) and lows at -170 degrees Fahrenheit (-112 degrees Celsius). This intense heat loss is likely a result of the fine dust on Phobos’ surface, which is unable to retain heat. Phobos has no atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=how-cold-is-phobos>How cold is Phobos?</h2>
<p>Temperatures vary on Phobos, reaching highs of 25 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 4 degrees Celsius) during the day, while nights can be as cold as minus 170 degrees F (minus 112 degrees C). The moon is so small that a 150-pound person standing on its surface would weigh only two ounces.</p>
<h2 id=does-phobos-have-oxygen>Does Phobos have oxygen?</h2>
<p>The Martian moon Phobos orbits through a stream of charged atoms and molecules that flow off the Red Planet’s atmosphere, new research shows. Many of these charged particles, or ions, of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and argon, have been escaping Mars for billions of years as the planet has been shedding its atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=will-we-lose-the-moon>Will we lose the moon?</h2>
<p>In about 50 billion years, the Moon will stop moving away from us and settle into a nice, stable orbit. At this point, the Moon will take about 47 days to go around the Earth (currently, it takes a little over 27 days). When this new stability is achieved, the Earth and the Moon will be tidally locked to each other.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-surface-temperature-of-phobos-on-mars>What is the surface temperature of Phobos on Mars?</h2>
<p>This preliminary analysis shows that the surface temperature, dependent on slope and particle size, varies from a high of +25 F (-4 C) on the most illuminated slopes to -170 F (-112 C) in shadows.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-phobos-compared-to-the-full-moon>How big is Phobos compared to the full moon?</h2>
<p>Orbital characteristics. As seen from Phobos, Mars would appear 6,400 times larger and 2,500 times brighter than the full Moon appears from Earth, taking up a quarter of the width of a celestial hemisphere. The Mars–Phobos Lagrangian L1 is 2.5 kilometers (1.6 mi) above Stickney, which is unusually close to the surface.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-crater-on-phobos>What is the name of the crater on Phobos?</h2>
<p>Its most prominent feature is the 6-mile (9.7 kilometer) crater Stickney, its impact causing streak patterns across the moon’s surface. Stickney was seen by Mars Global Surveyor to be filled with fine dust, with evidence of boulders sliding down its sloped surface. A 3D model of Phobos, on of two moons of Mars.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-weather-like-at-the-poles-of-mars>What’s the weather like at the poles of Mars?</h2>
<p>During winter, temperatures at the poles drop even further, reaching lows of -195 °F. Near the equator of Mars, daytime temperatures during the summer can reach 70 °F, but plummet to -100 °F at night.</p>
