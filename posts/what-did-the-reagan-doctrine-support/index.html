<h2 id=what-did-the-reagan-doctrine-support>What did the Reagan Doctrine support?</h2>
<p>Under the Reagan Doctrine, the United States provided overt and covert aid to anti-communist guerrillas and resistance movements in an effort to “roll back” Soviet-backed pro-communist governments in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-ronald-reagan-do-for-foreign-policy>What did Ronald Reagan do for foreign policy?</h2>
<p>The foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration was the foreign policy of the United States from 1981 to 1989. The main goal was winning the Cold War and the rollback of Communism—which was achieved in the Revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe during 1989 and in the Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-reagans-foreign-policy-quizlet>What was Reagan’s foreign policy quizlet?</h2>
<p>Was to develop a sophisticated anti-ballistic missile system in order to prevent missile attacks from other countries, specifically the Soviet Union.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-reagan-mean-by-peace-through-strength>What did Reagan mean by peace through strength?</h2>
<p>“Peace through strength” is a phrase that suggests that military power can help preserve peace. It is quite old and has famously been used by many leaders from Roman Emperor Hadrian in the first century AD to former US President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. The concept has long been associated with realpolitik.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-we-sell-weapons-to-iran-illegally>Why did we sell weapons to Iran illegally?</h2>
<p>The official justification for the arms shipments was that they were part of an operation to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-reagan-doctrine-in-the-middle-east>What was the Reagan Doctrine in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Johns and Heritage also argued that Mengistu’s decision to permit a Soviet naval and air presence on the Red Sea ports of Eritrea represented a strategic challenge to U.S. security interests in the Middle East and North Africa. The Heritage Foundation and the Reagan administration also sought to apply the Reagan Doctrine in Cambodia.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-reagan-do-for-the-mujahadeen-in-afghanistan>What did Reagan do for the mujahadeen in Afghanistan?</h2>
<p>During Reagan’s 8 years in power, the CIA secretly sent billions of dollars of military aid to the mujahedeen in Afghanistan in a US-supported jihad against the Soviet Union.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-reagan-doctrine-pre-dated-the-afghan-war>Is the Reagan Doctrine pre-dated the Afghan War?</h2>
<p>To watch the courageous Afghan freedom fighters battle modern arsenals with simple hand-held weapons is an inspiration to those who love freedom. At least one component of the Reagan Doctrine technically pre-dated the Reagan Presidency.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-presidents-that-followed-the-reagan-doctrine>Who are the presidents that followed the Reagan Doctrine?</h2>
<p>It was followed by the Eisenhower Doctrine, the Kennedy Doctrine, the Johnson Doctrine, the Nixon Doctrine, and the Carter Doctrine, all of which defined the foreign policy approaches of these respective U.S. presidents on some of the largest global challenges of their presidencies.</p>
