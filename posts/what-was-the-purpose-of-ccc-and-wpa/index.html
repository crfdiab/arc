<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-ccc-and-wpa>What was the purpose of CCC and WPA?</h2>
<p>Such agencies as the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) were established to dispense emergency and short-term governmental aid and to provide temporary jobs, employment on construction projects, and youth work in the national forests.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-ccc-wpa-and-fsa>What were the CCC WPA and FSA?</h2>
<p>CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) CWA (Civil Works Administration) FERA (Federal Emergency Relief Administration) FSA (Farm Security Administration)</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-ccc-and-what-did-it-do>What was the CCC and what did it do?</h2>
<p>The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a work relief program that gave millions of young men employment on environmental projects during the Great Depression. The CCC helped to shape the modern national and state park systems we enjoy today.</p>
<h2 id=what-problem-did-the-ccc-and-wpa-address>What problem did the CCC and WPA address?</h2>
<p>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt created emergency relief agencies, such as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA), to address the severe economic problems of the early 1930s.</p>
<h2 id=who-worked-in-the-ccc>Who worked in the CCC?</h2>
<p>The People The CCC was open to unemployed men ages 17 to 23.5 who were U.S. citizens. Enrollees served 6-month terms, and were allowed to re-enroll at the end of each term up to a maximum of two years. A CCC worker’s salary was $30 a month, most of which the men sent home to their families.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-ccc-and-the-wpa-important>Why was the CCC and the WPA important?</h2>
<p>The WPA and the CCC were often called “make work” programs. Some people called WPA workers lazy. But, these programs put men and women to work in jobs that would not have been accomplished without federal money. The jobs allowed men and women to feel the pride of working and contributing to their state and their families. Why is this important?</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-works-progress-administration--wpa--created>When was the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) created?</h2>
<p>The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was an ambitious employment and infrastructure program created by President Roosevelt in 1935, during the bleakest years of the Great Depression.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-the-ccc-or-the-pwa>Which is better the CCC or the PWA?</h2>
<p>The CCC focused on tangible, short-term, more foreseeable project goals. For this reason, the CCC is considered to be significantly more successful and worthwhile than the PWA. Similarly, this is why it is one of the most “popular” of the New Deal programs.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-civilian-conservation-corps--ccc->What was the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC )?</h2>
<p>The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a program designed to address the problem of jobless young men aged between 18 and 25 years old. CCC camps were set up all around the country.</p>
