<h2 id=how-much-ash-and-pumice-covered-the-city>How much ash and pumice covered the city?</h2>
<p>Just after midday on August 24, fragments of ash and other volcanic debris began pouring down on Pompeii, quickly covering the city to a depth of more than 9 feet (3 metres).</p>
<h2 id=how-much-ash-and-pumice-fell-on-pompeii>How much ash and pumice fell on Pompeii?</h2>
<p>Pompeii was buried under 14 to 17 feet of ash and pumice, and the nearby seacoast was drastically changed. Herculaneum was buried under more than 60 feet of mud and volcanic material.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-ash-did-vesuvius-release>How much ash did Vesuvius release?</h2>
<p>In the late summer or autumn of 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius violently spewed forth a deadly cloud of super-heated tephra and gases to a height of 33 km (21 mi), ejecting molten rock, pulverized pumice and hot ash at 1.5 million tons per second, ultimately releasing 100,000 times the thermal energy of the atomic bombings of …</p>
<h2 id=why-is-pompeii-more-famous-than-herculaneum>Why is Pompeii more famous than Herculaneum?</h2>
<p>Herculaneum, or Ercolano in Italian, was a wealthier city than Pompeii and remains better preserved because it was destroyed it in a different manner: lying along the coast and to the west of Mount Vesuvius, it was sheltered from the worst of the eruption thanks to winds that appear to have blown ash in a southwards …</p>
<h2 id=what-did-herculaneum-have-to-do-with-mount-vesuvius>What did Herculaneum have to do with Mount Vesuvius?</h2>
<p>Like its sister city, Pompeii, Herculaneum is famous for having been buried in ash, along with Stabiae, Oplontis and Boscoreale, during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 . Unlike Pompeii, the pyroclastic material that covered Herculaneum carbonized and thereby preserved wood in objects such as roofs,…</p>
<h2 id=how-did-pompeii-and-herculaneum-get-buried>How did Pompeii and Herculaneum get buried?</h2>
<p>These flows buried Pompeii under 4-6m of ash and covered Herculaneum in roughly 25m of ash. The discovery of Pompeii and Herculaneum First, we should mention that the depth of the volcanic debris covering the two cities played a major part in how they were discovered and excavated.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-herculaneum-get-destroyed-in-the-79-ad-eruption>How did Herculaneum get destroyed in the 79 AD eruption?</h2>
<p>Like its neighbour Pompeii, Herculaneum was destroyed in the 79 AD eruption; While many townsfolk evacuated, some perished sheltering in stone boathouses</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-bed-that-was-found-in-herculaneum>Where was the bed that was found in Herculaneum?</h2>
<p>The bed was in the Collegium Augustalium — a building owned by an imperial cult which worshipped the former emperor Augustus — and the man was likely its caretaker. In a separate study published this week, researchers led from from University of Naples Federico II found splatters of a solid, black, glassy material inside the man’s skull.</p>
