<h2 id=how-many-homeless-people-are-ex-prisoners>How many homeless people are ex prisoners?</h2>
<p>Ministry of Justice figures show 11,435 people were released from prison into homelessness in 2018-2019, and 4,742 homeless people started community sentences in the same period.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-most-affected-by-homelessness-in-australia>Who is most affected by homelessness in Australia?</h2>
<p>Australians known to be at particular risk of homelessness include those who have experienced family and domestic violence, young people, children on care and protection orders, Indigenous Australians, people leaving health or social care arrangements, and Australians aged 55 or older.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-prisoners-homeless>Why are prisoners homeless?</h2>
<p>People leaving prison are at high risk of homelessness for a number of reasons, they may have been homeless before entering prison, are dependent on drugs or alcohol or simply are unable to get support finding the right sort of accommodation on release. …</p>
<h2 id=which-city-in-australia-has-the-most-homeless>Which city in Australia has the most homeless?</h2>
<p>A majority of people experiencing homelessness long-term in Australia are found in the large cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. It is estimated that on any given night approximately 116,000 people will be homeless and many more are living in insecure housing, “one step away from being homeless”.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-british-start-sending-convicts-to-australia>When did the British start sending convicts to Australia?</h2>
<p>For the modern Australian penal system, see Punishment in Australia. Between 1788 and 1868, about 162,000 convicts were transported from Britain and Ireland to various penal colonies in Australia. The British Government began transporting convicts overseas to American colonies in the early 18th century.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-most-famous-convict-in-australia>Who was the most famous convict in Australia?</h2>
<p>There’s no more famous convict celebrity than Ned Kelly, an Irish bushranger whose battles with the British elite — including his final bloody shoot-out with police and eventual hanging in 1878 — have imbued him with Robin Hood status in Australian folklore.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-descended-from-convicts-in-australia>How many people are descended from convicts in Australia?</h2>
<p>Around 20% of modern Australians, in addition to 2 million Britons, are descended from transported convicts. The convict era has inspired famous novels, films, and other cultural works, and the extent to which it has shaped Australia’s national character has been studied by many writers and historians. William Hogarth ‘s Gin Lane, 1751.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-convicts-were-transported-to-australia-on-hulks>How many convicts were transported to Australia on hulks?</h2>
<p>A hulk could be up to 65 metres long. This is the same size as 6 buses placed end to end. On board each hulk there could be up to 300 convicts. There were many diseases on board and convicts died. Between 1776 and 1795 nearly 2000 out of almost 6000 convicts held on hulks, died.</p>
