<h2 id=what-is-the-circulation-of-lakes>What is the circulation of lakes?</h2>
<p>Water circulation is the mixing of water in a lake. Water mixes at the surface, within the top layer, the epilimnion, and among layers. The bottom layer of water is called the hypolimnion, and the water between the hypolimnion and epilimnion makes up the metalimnion.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-lake-stratification>What causes lake stratification?</h2>
<p>Many of our Illinois lakes and reservoirs are deep enough to stratify, or form “layers” of water with different temperatures. Such thermal stratification occurs because of the large differences in density (weight) between warm and cold waters.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-fish-do-when-the-lake-turns-over>What do fish do when the lake turns over?</h2>
<p>Above the thermocline – in the warmer layer that fish biologists call the epilimnion – fish survive comfortably in the oxygen-rich water. Below that line (the hypolimnion) low oxygen levels discourage fish from living there. When a lake turns, the surface water falls and the now-warmer water from the bottom rises.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-a-lake-when-it-turns-over>What happens to a lake when it turns over?</h2>
<p>As the surface water cools and gets heavier it wants to sink. Eventually this cooler water layer does sink and displaces warmer water in the lower portions of the lake and the entire lake “mixes” itself. Top goes to the bottom, bottom comes to the top, henceforth the name “turnover.”</p>
<h2 id=when-a-pond-turns-over-does-it-kill-all-the-fish>When a pond turns over does it kill all the fish?</h2>
<p>These types of turnovers are usually the most damaging to the health of a pond. In some cases, a pond turnover can happen so quickly that it will kill fish due to a severe drop in dissolved oxygen levels.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-fish-to-die-in-a-pond>What causes fish to die in a pond?</h2>
<p>The most common cause of fish kills is suffocation due to lack of dissolved oxygen. Most dissolved oxygen is produced by algae and aquatic plants through photosynthesis. Ponds suitable for supporting fish should have a minimum pre-dawn oxygen level that is close to optimal levels required by the fish.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-a-lake-to-turn-over>How long does it take for a lake to turn over?</h2>
<p>Lakes can take a few days to turn or it can happen over night. A cold front, cold rain, or a heavy wind can increase the turnover rate. When a lake turns, the surface water falls and the now-warmer water from the bottom rises.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-water-circulation-mean>What does water circulation mean?</h2>
<p>Ocean circulation is the large scale movement of waters in the ocean basins. Surface circulation carries the warm upper waters poleward from the tropics. Heat is disbursed along the way from the waters to the atmosphere. At the poles, the water is further cooled during winter, and sinks to the deep ocean.</p>
<h2 id=is-lake-stratification-bad>Is Lake stratification bad?</h2>
<p>Climate change could cause ‘irreversible impacts’ to lake ecosystems. The disruption of lake stratification to lake ecosystems could be incredibly damaging. “Stratification periods” are a seasonal separation of water into layers.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-lake-stratification-and-turnover>What is lake stratification and turnover?</h2>
<p>Simply put, lake turnover is the seasonal mixing of the entire water column. For many lakes deeper than about 20 feet, distinct, thermally stratified layers of water form during the summer. These layers prevent the lake from mixing and aerating. Shallow lakes mix frequently and rarely experience stratification.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-a-lake-turns-over>What does it mean when a lake turns over?</h2>
<p>Lake turnover is the process of a lake’s water turning over from top (epilimnion) to bottom (hypolimnion).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-process-of-lake-turnover>What is the name of the process of Lake turnover?</h2>
<p>Lake Turnover. Illustration. Lake turnover is the process of a lake’s water turning over from top (epilimnion) to bottom (hypolimnion). Lake turnover is the process of a lake’s water turning over from top (epilimnion) to bottom (hypolimnion). During the summer, the epilimnion, or surface layer, is the warmest.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-water-in-a-lake>What happens to the water in a lake?</h2>
<p>Lake Turnover. Lake turnover is the seasonal movement of water in a lake. Shallow lakes experience very little lake turnover, while large, deep lakes experience major changes as waters of different temperatures mix.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-lakes-stratify-and-when-do-they-turn-over>When do lakes stratify and when do they turn over?</h2>
<p>Dimictic: like at IISD-ELA, lakes are stratified in summer and winter, and mix once in spring and once in fall. Warm monomictic: water cools to near 4°C in winter, when turnover may occur. Lakes are stratified during other times of the year and are not ice covered.</p>
