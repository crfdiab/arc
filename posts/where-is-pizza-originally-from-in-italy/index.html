Pizza/Origins</p>

<p>That did start in Italy. Specifically, baker Raffaele Esposito from Naples is often given credit for making the first such pizza pie. Historians note, however, that street vendors in Naples sold flatbreads with toppings for many years before then.</p>

<p>Naples<br>
1. Naples: Pizza Napoletana. If pizza is your priority for a trip to Italy then Naples – the birthplace of modern pizza – is the place you need to go. Famously featured in the film Eat, Pray, Love, Pizza Napoletana is the city’s signature dish and it’s not just any pizza.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-pizza-famous-in-italy>Why is pizza famous in Italy?</h2>
<p>Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.</p>
<h2 id=is-pizza-actually-from-italy>Is pizza actually from Italy?</h2>
<p>Pizza has a long history. But the modern birthplace of pizza is southwestern Italy’s Campania region, home to the city of Naples. Founded around 600 B.C. as a Greek settlement, Naples in the 1700s and early 1800s was a thriving waterfront city.</p>

<hr>
<p>Most people attribute the beginnings of pizza to Italy, but it was really that one city where pizza was a “thing.” In fact, it seems that before pizza became a popular cuisine in Italy, it stormed America. So, it was created in Naples in Italy, but it took a while to catch on.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-pizza-is-sold-in-italy>What kind of pizza is sold in Italy?</h2>
<p>The Italians formed a governing body called the ‘ True Neapolitan Pizza Association ’ (TNPA) in 1984. The Association upholds the standards of true Neapolitan pizza. A variety of pizza options sold by slice in Venice, Italy. Only the Margherita and Marinara are regarded as authentic Italian pizzas.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-name-pizza-margherita-come-from>Where did the name Pizza Margherita come from?</h2>
<p>Origins. An often recounted story holds that on 11 June 1889, to honour the Queen consort of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, the Neapolitan pizzamaker Raffaele Esposito created the “Pizza Margherita”, a pizza garnished with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, to represent the national colours of Italy as on the Italian flag.</p>

<p>Pizza—flatbreads with various toppings, eaten for any meal and sold by street vendors or informal restaurants—met this need. “Judgmental Italian authors often called their eating habits ‘disgusting,’” Helstosky notes.</p>
