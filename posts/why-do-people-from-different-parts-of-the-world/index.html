<h2 id=why-do-people-from-different-parts-of-the-world>Why do people from different parts of the world?</h2>
<p>social background , cultural factors, regional factors, linguistic differences all is behind the people living differently in different parts of the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-humans-look-the-way-they-do>Why do humans look the way they do?</h2>
<p>The researchers conclude that the face’s appearance is a combination of biomechanical, physiological, and social influences. The face: it’s personal, yet universal. It’s how we recognize each other and communicate our emotions—and yet there’s more to it than immediately meets the eye.</p>
<h2 id=what-facial-feature-is-unique-to-humans>What facial feature is unique to humans?</h2>
<p>And the most variable trait of all was the triangular shape that connects the eyes, mouth and nose — making our faces the most unique parts of our body.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-people-different>Why are people different?</h2>
<p>In fact, for humans, about half of the differences in personality are genetic, Soto said. The rest of the variability in personality comes from your environment, such as life experiences and birth order. Humans, after all, have evolved to learn from our environments. Over time, that means personalities can change.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-different-nationalities-look-different>Why do different nationalities look different?</h2>
<p>The reason can be simple, as we have more experience of members of our own race & so we find it easier to remember their faces. OR other races are generally perceived to have fewer unique personal attributes & therefore to have more in common with one another.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-look-different-in-others-eyes>Do you look different in others eyes?</h2>
<p>As nobody has a symmetrical face, everyone looks different in real life to what they look like in a mirror. Everyone looks different to themselves in a photo to what they see in a mirror. you look like the mirror version of you more than the photographic version since all photos lie, they distort, and they are static.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-someone-with-same-personality>What do you call someone with same personality?</h2>
<p>There’s no one established way to say it, but some people use a metaphor or simile to express how similar one person is to the other. They are soul-mates (used mainly in romantic relationships). They’re practically twins. They’re like two peas in a pod (very colloquial). They’re like minded.</p>
<h2 id=which-personality-has-the-highest-liking-towards-curiosity>Which personality has the highest liking towards curiosity?</h2>
<p>Openness. This trait features characteristics such as imagination and insight. 1﻿ People who are high in this trait also tend to have a broad range of interests. They are curious about the world and other people and eager to learn new things and enjoy new experiences.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-countries-around-the-world-view-national-identity>How are countries around the world view national identity?</h2>
<p>While many in the countries surveyed are open to those born elsewhere being part of “the nation,” acceptance comes with certain requisites. Majorities in every country surveyed say it is very important to speak the dominant language to be considered truly a national of that land.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-open-minded-people-see-the-world-differently>Why do open minded people see the world differently?</h2>
<p>People possessing openness can take diverging visual stimuli and combine them in a special way. Getty Images. Open-minded people literally see the world differently. That’s according to researchers at the University of Melbourne in Australia. Scientists there gave volunteers a personality test.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-remember-the-faces-of-other-people>Why do people remember the faces of other people?</h2>
<p>It could be because we have more experience of members of our own race and so find it easier remembering their faces. Or it could be because people of other races are generally perceived to have fewer unique personal attributes and, therefore, to have more in common with one another.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-find-the-other-side-of-the-world>How do you find the other side of the world?</h2>
<p>First, figure out the latitude and longitude of your current location. Then, take the latitude and convert it to the opposite hemisphere. For instance, if you’re located in New York City your latitude is 40.7128°N simply flip that to -40.7128°S. For longitude, you will have to subtract the longitude of your current location from 180°.</p>
