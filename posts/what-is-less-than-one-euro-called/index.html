<h2 id=what-are-the-denominations-of-the-euro-coins>What are the denominations of the euro coins?</h2>
<p>Euro coins exist in denominations of 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents and 50 cents. In addition, the European Union mints €1 and €2 coins for circulation.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-euro-the-second-largest-currency-in-the-world>Is the euro the second largest currency in the world?</h2>
