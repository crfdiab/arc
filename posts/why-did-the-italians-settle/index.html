<h2 id=why-did-the-italians-settle>Why did the Italians settle?</h2>
<p>Since Italian immigrants came to America in search of work and money and not in search of a new life and a new home Italian Americans settled wherever there was work available. Italians Americans usually settled in big cities where jobs were easy to find.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-italian-immigrants-settled-in-america-and-why>Where did Italian immigrants settled in America and why?</h2>
<p>In the United States, most Italians began their new lives as manual laborers in eastern cities, mining camps and farms. Italians settled mainly in the Northeastern US and other industrial cities in the Midwest where working-class jobs were available.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-settlers-come-to-iowa>When did settlers come to Iowa?</h2>
<p>The first official white settlement in Iowa began in June 1833, in the Black Hawk Purchase. Most of Iowa’s first white settlers came from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-immigrants-come-to-iowa-in-the-1800s>Why did immigrants come to Iowa in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>In the late 1800s and until World War I, immigrants from Italy, Russia and Eastern Europe began showing up in the census. Because most of the land was now privately owned and no longer available at cheap prices from the government, it was early Iowa industries that attracted these new arrivals.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-italians-and-croatians-come-to-iowa>Why did Italians and Croatians come to Iowa?</h2>
<p>Because most of the land was now privately owned and no longer available at cheap prices from the government, it was early Iowa industries that attracted these new arrivals. Coal mining was important in drawing Italians and Croatians. Often a single male would arrive and get a job in a coal mine.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-settlers-come-to-eastern-iowa>Why did the settlers come to eastern Iowa?</h2>
<p>Following the Black Hawk War when Native Americans were pressured to relinquish title to a significant portion of eastern Iowa, pioneers headed for the “land across the river.” Most early settlers were attracted by the acres of cheap government land.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-most-of-the-italian-immigrants-come-from>Where did most of the Italian immigrants come from?</h2>
<p>Most of this generation of Italian immigrants took their first steps on U.S. soil in a place that has now become a legend—Ellis Island. In the 1880s, they numbered 300,000; in the 1890s, 600,000; in the decade after that, more than two million.</p>
