<h2 id=is-the-uk-still-part-of-the-eu>Is the UK still part of the EU?</h2>
<p>The UK left the EU at the end of 31 January 2020 CET (11 p.m. GMT). During the transition, the UK remained subject to EU law and remained part of the EU customs union and single market. However, it was no longer part of the EU’s political bodies or institutions.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-us-still-part-of-the-eu>Is the US still part of the EU?</h2>
<p>No, the United States is not part of the European Union. It does not qualify since it is located in the Americas rather than Europe.</p>
<h2 id=who-can-stay-in-uk-after-brexit>Who can stay in UK after Brexit?</h2>
<p>If you have lived in the UK for more than 5 years, you can apply to the British government for settled status. This gives people the right to live and work in the UK. It also gives you the right to accrue state pension and to access public services.</p>

<h2 id=can-uk-deport-eu-citizens>Can UK deport EU citizens?</h2>
<p>Currently, EU citizens living in the UK can only be targeted for immigration control if they are found not to be exercising ‘treaty rights,’ but that can mean anything from being out of work to having committed a criminal offence, or if deportation is considered in the ‘public interest’.</p>

<p>However, there are other countries which are in Europe hence within the EU radius but are not part of the union for one reason or the other. Despite being within the EU territories, Albania is not part of the European Union. However, it has been a “potential candidate country” since 2000 when it was recognized.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-countries-are-there-in-the-eu>How many countries are there in the EU?</h2>
<p>The European Union (EU) is an economic and political union of 28 countries. It operates an internal (or single) market which allows free movement of goods, capital, services and people between member states. The EU countries are:</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-country-become-a-member-of-the-european-union>How does a country become a member of the European Union?</h2>
<p>To join the European Union, it is required for all member states to agree; if a single member state disagrees, the applying country is declined accession to the European Union. In addition to enlargement by adding new countries, the EU can also expand by having territories of member states, which are outside the EU,…</p>
<h2 id=is-the-uk-out-of-the-european-union>Is the UK out of the European Union?</h2>
<p>After 1,650 days of troubled transition, the UK’s departure from the EU is completed this week. We’re out of the European Union. Just how did we get here?</p>
