<h2 id=what-group-migrated-east-and-south-in-africa-spreading-their-language-and-culture>What group migrated east and south in Africa spreading their language and culture?</h2>
<p>The Bantu migrations were the migrations in Africa, which changed African culture and society. – Bantu speakers migrate south and east starting about 3000 B.C.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-bantu-migration-spread>What did the Bantu migration spread?</h2>
<p>The Bantu migration was also associated with the spread of new technology such as iron smelting, pottery making, house construction, and the spread of Bantu languages (Phillipson 1977a, 2005; Vansina 1994; Mapunda 2002).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-bantu-language-group-spread-across-africa>How did the Bantu language group spread across Africa?</h2>
<p>How did the Bantu language group spread across Africa? Migration of Bantu-speaking peoples and interactions with local groups. Involved small groups of people who spoke Bantu moving from one point to another. This was useful because Bantu-speaking people could now migrate to places where yams did not grow easily.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-bantu-language-spread>How did the Bantu language spread?</h2>
<p>Bantu languages are generally thought to have originated approximately 5000 years ago (ya) in the Cameroonian Grassfields area neighbouring Nigeria, and started to spread, possibly together with agricultural technologies [1], through Sub-Saharan Africa as far as Kenya in the east and the Cape in the south [2].</p>
<h2 id=which-best-describes-the-shona-leadership>Which best describes the Shona leadership?</h2>
<p>Answer Expert Verified One thing that best describes the Shona leadership is it is a council of elders.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-bantu-leave-their-homeland>Why did the Bantu leave their homeland?</h2>
<p>Bantu people might have decided or might have often been forced to move away from their initial settlements by any one or many of the following circumstances: Overpopulation. exhaustion of local resources – agricultural land, grazing lands, forests, and water sources. increased competition for local resources.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-bantu-introduce-to-southern-africa>What did the Bantu introduce to southern Africa?</h2>
<p>The Bantu expansion first introduced Bantu peoples to Central, Southern, and Southeast Africa, regions they had previously been absent from. In Eastern and Southern Africa, Bantu speakers may have adopted livestock husbandry from other unrelated Cushitic- and Nilotic-speaking peoples they encountered.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-modern-day-shona-similar-to-their-ancestor>How are modern day Shona similar to their ancestor?</h2>
<p>How are modern-day Shona similar to their ancestors? They raise cattle and cultivate sorghum. The map shows sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the Swahili Coast. In what area of Africa did the early Bantu originate?</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-people-of-south-africa-migrate-from>Where did the people of South Africa migrate from?</h2>
<p>They migrated from their ancestral land in West Africa, towards the south, settled in central and south Africa and collective occupying a third of the African continent. Their migration is credited with the spread of iron smelting, agriculture and assimilation of other cultures of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-bantu-speaking-people-migrate-to-africa>Why did the Bantu speaking people migrate to Africa?</h2>
<p>Their migration is credited with the spread of iron smelting, agriculture and assimilation of other cultures of sub-Saharan Africa. The ability of the Bantu speaking people to unite under the Bantu identity as they migrated despite the multilingual composition led to their great influence on the continent.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-pygmies-live-after-the-bantu-migration>Where did the Pygmies live after the Bantu migration?</h2>
<p>The Pygmies, short brown-skinned people, inhabited central Africa, and were among the last purely hunting societies remaining after the Bantu migrations. Evidence of iron-working dates to the sixth century B.C. in the upper Nile and to the fifth century B.C. in Nigeria.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-modern-humans-leave-africa>When did the first modern humans leave Africa?</h2>
<p>Though it is unclear when some modern humans first left Africa, evidence shows that these modern humans did not leave Africa until between 60,000 and 90,000 years ago. Most likely, a change in climate helped to push them out.</p>
