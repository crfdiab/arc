<p>Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto led the first European expedition across the Mississippi River and entered native Tula territory near present-day Fort Smith, Arkansas today in 1541.</p>
<h2 id=was-hernando-de-soto-was-looking-for-el-dorado-when-he-came-to-arkansas>Was Hernando de Soto was looking for El Dorado when he came to Arkansas?</h2>
<p>While De Soto still was searching for El Dorado, and in Arkansas, a painted Indian woman ran into his camp and told him that she had fled from other bearded, pale-faced men like himself, who were only nine days away.</p>
<h2 id=did-de-soto-die-in-arkansas>Did de Soto die in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>At some point, the expedition crossed the Arkansas River and undoubtedly made contact with some Caddoan peoples. When the winter ended, it made its way back to the Mississippi River. At a village called Guachoya, presumed to be somewhere near present-day Lake Village (Chicot County), de Soto died.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-desotos-men-deserting>Why was DeSoto’s men deserting?</h2>
<p>Why was DeSoto’s men deserting him ? He was stern and mean. What did DeSoto accomplish ? He discovered the Mississippi River, he claimed land in Southeastern U.S. and he gathered information about the land.</p>

<p>Hernando de Soto<br>
Hernando de Soto was a Spanish explorer who led an expedition into the southern United States. He and his soldiers were the first Europeans to set foot in what is now Arkansas.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-hernando-de-soto-end-up-in-arkansas>Where did Hernando de Soto end up in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>After traveling around the state for almost a year, de Soto led his expedition back to the Mississippi River, somewhere in southeast Arkansas. By that time, he and most of his entourage were disillusioned and tired of the difficult journey and the battles with Indians over the past three years.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-hernando-de-soto-born-and-raised>Where was Hernando de Soto born and raised?</h2>
<p>De Soto was born in the Extremadura region of western Spain around 1500, but the exact date is uncertain. He probably was born in the town of Jerez de los Caballeros. The second son of Francisco Méndez de Soto and Leonor Arias Tinoco, he had at least two younger sisters and an older brother.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-hernando-de-soto-do-in-the-west-indies>What did Hernando de Soto do in the West Indies?</h2>
<p>The 16th-century Spanish explorer and conquistador Hernando de Soto (c. 1496-1542) arrived in the West Indies as a young man and went on to make a fortune in the Central American slave trade.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hernando-de-soto-cross-the-mississippi-river>When did Hernando de Soto cross the Mississippi River?</h2>
<p>His contract with the king required him to explore the region and establish settlements and forts. After landing on the southwest coast of Florida, the crew traveled through the Southeast before crossing the Mississippi River into what is now Arkansas on June 28, 1541 (June 18 on the Julian calendar, which was used at that time).</p>
