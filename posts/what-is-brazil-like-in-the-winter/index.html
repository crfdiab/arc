<h2 id=what-is-brazil-like-in-the-winter>What is Brazil like in the winter?</h2>
<p>Winter is the dry season there, and it runs from June to August. Mild daytime temperatures give way to chilly nights, and the lack of precipitation makes this an ideal time to visit the area. Summer brings wet weather from December through March.</p>
<h2 id=what-activities-do-people-in-brazil-do>What activities do people in Brazil do?</h2>
<p>What to see in Brazil</p>
<ul>
<li>Get soaked by Iguazu Falls.</li>
<li>Hang ten at Florianópolis Beaches.</li>
<li>Be humbled by the Cathedral of Brasília.</li>
<li>Recharge at Ilha Grande.</li>
<li>Dive head first into Abismo Anhumas.</li>
<li>Trek cliff faces at Aparados da Serra National Park.</li>
<li>Snorkel with sea turtles at Fernando de Noronha.</li>
<li>Clip-clop through Paraty.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=does-brazil-have-four-seasons>Does Brazil have four seasons?</h2>
<p>As Brazil lies in the Southern Hemisphere, its seasons are the exact opposite of what Northern Hemisphere residents are used to: summer is December through March and winter June through September. Within the country the climate varies considerably from region to region.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-the-winter-holidays-start-in-brazil>When do the winter holidays start in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Brazil winter holidays are quite busy especially the month of July when the schools and universities go for winter breaks. Rio de Janerio and Sao Paulo are two cities that lie at a distance of some 300 miles. Distance between both the cities is very less but still the exhibit diversity in their climatic conditions.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-brazil-less-crowded-in-the-winter>Why is Brazil less crowded in the winter?</h2>
<p>Cities and resort areas are also typically less crowded and less expensive in the winter, as Carnaval — Brazil’s largest annual festival — and other major holidays traditionally occur in warmer months when locals acclimated to the heat prefer to take vacations.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-summer-and-winter-in-brazil>What’s the difference between summer and winter in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Winter Travel Tips. Unlike Brazil’s hot and humid summers, winters are considerably mild by comparison and produce far less rainfall. Cities and resort areas are also typically less crowded and less expensive in the winter, as Carnaval — Brazil’s largest annual festival — and other major holidays traditionally occur in warmer months…</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-that-there-is-snow-in-brazil>Is it true that there is snow in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Yes, Brazil certainly does have snow! Many people forget that Brazil is a continent-sized country, larger than the continental US. While the US and Brazil are virtually identical when measured from east to west, Brazil’s north to south measurement exceeds that of the US by more than 1000 miles!</p>
