<h2 id=when-did-ocean-oil-rigs-start>When did ocean oil rigs start?</h2>
<p>Offshore drilling began in 1897, just 38 years after Col. Edwin Drake drilled the first well in 1859. H.L. Williams is credited with drilling a well off a wooden pier in the Santa Barbara Channel in California.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-have-oil-rigs-been-used-in-the-gulf-coast>How long have oil rigs been used in the Gulf Coast?</h2>
<p>The Gulf’s first oil platform was built way back in 1938, but it wasn’t until the ’70s that offshore rigs as we know them appeared.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-oil-rig-in-mexico>What is the name of the oil rig in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Deepwater Horizon oil spill, also called Gulf of Mexico oil spill, largest marine oil spill in history, caused by an April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig—located in the Gulf of Mexico, approximately 41 miles (66 km) off the coast of Louisiana—and its subsequent sinking on April 22.</p>

<p>Before we jump into the angling itself, a little history. It’s still about fishing, we promise. The Gulf’s first oil platform was built way back in 1938, but it wasn’t until the ‘70s that offshore rigs as we know them appeared.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-oil-spill-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-happen>Where did the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico happen?</h2>
<p>On April 20, 2010, the oil drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, operating in the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, exploded and sank resulting in the death of 11 workers on the Deepwater Horizon and the largest spill of oil in the history of marine oil drilling operations. 4 million barrels of oil flowed from the damaged Macondo well over an …</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-offshore-oil-well-drilled>Where was the first offshore oil well drilled?</h2>
<p>In 1938, the first offshore well was constructed in the Gulf of Mexico. Pure Oil and Superior Oil Company built a freestanding drilling platform—a 320-foot by 180-foot freestanding wooden deck in 14-feet of water about a mile offshore near Creole, Louisiana.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-oil-rig-fishing-become-so-popular>When did oil rig fishing become so popular?</h2>
<p>By 1984, oil rig fishing was so popular that Congress passed laws allowing states to turn these fish magnets into permanent reefs. This became known as “ The Rigs to Reefs Program ” and it created some of the Gulf’s top fishing spots.</p>
