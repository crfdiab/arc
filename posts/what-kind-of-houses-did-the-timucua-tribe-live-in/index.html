<h2 id=what-kind-of-houses-did-the-timucua-tribe-live-in>What kind of houses did the Timucua tribe live in?</h2>
<p>long house<br>
One type of home, referred to as a long house, was built using poles for the frame, bark for the walls, and branches from palmetto palm trees for the roof. The other type of home was round and covered with leaves of palm trees. The Timucua were known to have more permanent villages than the other tribes.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-tequesta-tribe-live>Where did the Tequesta tribe live?</h2>
<p>The Tequesta were a small, peaceful, Native American tribe. They were one of the first tribes in South Florida and they settled near Biscayne Bay in the present-day Miami area. They built many villages at the mouth of the Miami River and along the coastal islands.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-timucua-tribe-die-out>How did the Timucua tribe die out?</h2>
<p>After the arrival of the French and Spanish, the number of Timucua became smaller with each passing year. The Europeans brought diseases with them that the Timucua easily caught and died from, since their bodies did not have natural resistance to the diseases.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-tequesta-bury-their-chiefs>Why did the Tequesta bury their chiefs?</h2>
<p>Customs. By one account, when the Tequestas for a tradition buried their chiefs, they buried the small bones with the body, and put the large bones in a box for the village people to adore and hold as their gods. The Tequesta also believed that humans have three souls.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-tequesta-tribe-still-exist>Does the Tequesta tribe still exist?</h2>
<p>The Tequesta were a small, peaceful, Native American tribe. They settled near Biscayne Bay in present-day Miami. They built many villages at the mouth of the Miami River and along the coastal islands. This is some very expensive real estate today!</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-houses-did-the-timucuans-build>What kind of houses did the Timucuans build?</h2>
<p>In Timucuan villages, there were usually two kinds of houses. One type of home was referred to as the long house. It was built using poles for the frame, and branches from palmetto trees for the sides and roof.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-culture-did-the-timucua-indians-have>What kind of culture did the Timucua Indians have?</h2>
<p>Eventually it became the common term for all peoples who spoke what is known as the Timucuan language. While alliances and confederacies arose between the chiefdoms from time to time, the Timucua were never organized into a single political unit. The various groups of Timucua speakers practiced several different cultural traditions.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-timucua-mission-in-the-16th-century>Where was the Timucua mission in the 16th century?</h2>
<p>In the 16th century they designated the area north of the Santa Fe River between the St. Johns and Suwannee Rivers (roughly the area of the group known as the Northern Utina) as the Timucua Province, which they incorporated into the mission system.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-timucua-use-their-canoes-for>What did the Timucua use their canoes for?</h2>
<p>Canoes were used as transportation and in fishing and setting nets. The Timucua grew much of their own food and stayed in relatively the same places from year to year.</p>
