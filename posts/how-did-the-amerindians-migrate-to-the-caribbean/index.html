<h2 id=how-did-the-amerindians-migrate-to-the-caribbean>How did the Amerindians migrate to the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>One example is Brigands’ War, also known as the Second Carib War (1794 -1798). Merchants and plantation owners moved into the region. They migrated to the Caribbean to work on plantations in places such as Jamaica, Trinidad and British Guiana. So-called ‘Liberated Africans’ were also indentured during this time.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-amerindians-survive>How did the Amerindians survive?</h2>
<p>They survived by hunting, gathering and raiding their more established neighbors for their crops. Because these groups were always on the move, their homes were much less permanent than the pueblos.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-amerindians-in-the-caribbean>What happened to the Amerindians in the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>They moved in to the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic) at least 5,000 years ago. The Arawak were displaced in eastern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and almost all of the eastern Caribbean islands. This displacement happened within 100 years of the Spanish arriving in 1492.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-have-the-amerindians-been-in-trinidad>How long have the Amerindians been in Trinidad?</h2>
<p>Amerindian peoples have existed in Trinidad for as long as 6,000 years before the arrival of Columbus, and numbered at least 40,000 at the time of Spanish settlement in 1592. All of Trinidad was populated by several tribes, Trinidad being a transit point in the Caribbean network of Amerindian trade…</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-amerindians-of-the-caribbean-come-from>Where did the Amerindians of the Caribbean come from?</h2>
<p>Using Trinidad as a stepping stone they spread up the Caribbean and beyond. Ethnologist have noted common characteristics with the cultures of south eastern USA. For many years this led some to believe that they originated there, archaeological finds have confirmed that their origin is most certainly Amazonic.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-indigenous-people-of-trinidad-and-tobago>Who are the indigenous people of Trinidad and Tobago?</h2>
<p>Tobago is represented by a significant amount of information, including a dense chapter devoted to its indigenous people.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-peons-bring-to-trinidad-and-tobago>What did the peons bring to Trinidad and Tobago?</h2>
<p>Peons also brought Venezuelan names of various Amerindian origins to Trinidad, and the two countries share an important number of place names through the movement of speakers of a range of languages. Warao is a language isolate, and one Warao place name is Chaguanas (name of the Warao group).</p>
