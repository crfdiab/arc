<h2 id=which-colony-came-to-north-america-religious-freedom>Which colony came to North America religious freedom?</h2>
<p>Plymouth: the first Puritan colony The first group of Puritans to make their way across the Atlantic was a small contingent known as the Pilgrims. Unlike other Puritans, they insisted on a complete separation from the Church of England and had first migrated to the Dutch Republic seeking religious freedom.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-groups-came-to-america-religious-freedom>What two groups came to America religious freedom?</h2>
<p>In the storybook version most of us learned in school, the Pilgrims came to America aboard the Mayflower in search of religious freedom in 1620. The Puritans soon followed, for the same reason.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-in-the-middle-colonies>What was the religion in the Middle Colonies?</h2>
<p>The middle colonies saw a mixture of religions, including Quakers (who founded Pennsylvania), Catholics, Lutherans, a few Jews, and others. The southern colonists were a mixture as well, including Baptists and Anglicans.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-religious-freedom-important-in-the-colonies>Why was religious freedom important in the colonies?</h2>
<p>In Britain, the Anglican Church ruled over the country as there was no separation of church and state. Anyone who believed different from the Church was punished severely, so many traveled to America to seek refuge. Colonies were established with the intent of religious freedom, but many strayed away from that goal.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-religion-in-american-history>What was the role of religion in American history?</h2>
<p>From the colonial era to present, religion has played a major role in politics in the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court over the years has ruled inconsistently on matters of religious freedom, such as the display of religious symbols in government buildings. America wasn’t always a stronghold of religious freedom.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-of-the-new-england-colonies>What was the religion of the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>The New England Colonies were primarily composed of Puritans. This particular group of people believed in strict religious principles and had a strong passion for religion. If one were to break any of their religious laws, they received a strict punishment.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-religious-toleration-start-in-the-colonies>When did religious toleration start in the colonies?</h2>
<p>Mid-Atlantic and Southern Colonies. The Catholic leadership passed a law of religious toleration in 1649, only to see it repealed it when Puritans took over the colony’s assembly. Clergy and buildings belonging to both the Catholic and Puritan religions were subsidized by a general tax. Quakers founded Pennsylvania.</p>
