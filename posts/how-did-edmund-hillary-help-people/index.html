<h2 id=how-did-edmund-hillary-help-people>How did Edmund Hillary help people?</h2>
<p>In 1960 Hillary was determined to help the impoverished Sherpas in the Khumbu region of Nepal, who had put so much effort into his expeditions. He established the Himalayan Trust, which built schools, airfields, bridges, clinics and hospitals in Nepal, and restored Buddhist monasteries.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-schools-did-hillary-build>How many schools did Hillary build?</h2>
<p>42 schools<br>
It was his life’s great work. Ed Hillary built and ran 42 schools, hospitals and medical clinics in the Mt Everest region.</p>
<h2 id=did-edmund-hillary-have-oxygen>Did Edmund Hillary have oxygen?</h2>
<p>Climbing Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world, was a challenge that eluded scores of great mountaineers until 1953, when Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzig Norgay first reached its summit. But all of these climbers had relied on bottled oxygen to achieve their high-altitude feats.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-schools-did-sir-edmund-hillary-build>How many schools did Sir Edmund Hillary build?</h2>
<p>Twenty-six more schools followed, airstrips at Lukla and Phaplu, hospitals at Khunde and Phaplu, twelve health clinics, rebuilding a burnt-out Tengboche Monastery. Ed’s aid work was the great achievement of the last fifty years of his life and this work is continued through the Himalayan Trust.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-sir-edmund-hillary-help-the-people-of-nepal>How did Sir Edmund Hillary help the people of Nepal?</h2>
<p>Following his ascent of Everest, Hillary devoted most of his life to helping the people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, building schools, hospitals, bridges, an airstrip, and much more.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-edmund-hillary-do-as-a-child>What did Edmund Hillary do as a child?</h2>
<p>As a child he helped in his father’s beekeeping business and eventually quit school to work with his father full-time. In 1935, during a ski weekend on a school trip to Mount Ruapehu, Hillary discovered his joy in the mountains and it never left him.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-sir-edmund-hillary-start-his-expedition>When did Sir Edmund Hillary start his expedition?</h2>
<p>But in 1953, Hillary was chosen to join the British Joint Himalayan Committee and after a selection process, Hillary was chosen for the final summit push along with Tenzing Norgay – local sherpa whom Hillary got along well with. The expedition set up a base camp in March 1953.</p>
