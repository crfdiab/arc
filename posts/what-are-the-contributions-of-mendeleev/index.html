<h2 id=what-are-the-contributions-of-mendeleev>What are the contributions of Mendeleev?</h2>
<p>Dmitri Mendeleev devised the periodic classification of the chemical elements, in which the elements were arranged in order of increasing atomic weight.</p>
<h2 id=what-four-elements-did-mendeleev>What four elements did Mendeleev?</h2>
<p>He named them eka-boron, eka-aluminium, eka-silicon, and eka-manganese, with respective atomic masses of 44, 68, 72, and 100.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-mendeleevs-work-contribute-to-the-discovery-of-elements>How did Mendeleev’s work contribute to the discovery of elements?</h2>
<p>When Mendeleev arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic mass, the properties where repeated. He corrected the known atomic masses of some elements and he used the patterns in his table to predict the properties of the elements he thought must exist but had yet to be discovered.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-dmitri-mendeleev-work-with>Who did Dmitri Mendeleev work with?</h2>
<p>Julius Lothar Meyer (1830–1895) and Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev (1834–1907) worked at the University of Heidelberg only five years apart—both under the direction of Robert Bunsen—but they arrived there with significantly different backgrounds. Meyer was virtually born into a scientific career.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-the-law-of-octave>Who discovered the law of octave?</h2>
<p>John Newlands<br>
An English scientist called John Newlands put forward his Law of Octaves in 1864. He arranged all the elements known at the time into a table in order of relative atomic mass. When he did this, he found a pattern among the early elements.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-mendeleevs-greatest-scientific-contribution>What is Mendeleev’s greatest scientific contribution?</h2>
<p>Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev (1834 – 1907) was a Russian chemist most famous for his contributions to the Periodic Table. He was the first to publish a periodic table similar to the one we use today and is credited for discovering the Periodic law.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-law-of-octet>What is the law of octet?</h2>
<p>The octet rule states that atoms tend to form compounds in ways that give them eight valence electrons and thus the electron configuration of a noble gas. An exception to an octet of electrons is in the case of the first noble gas, helium, which only has two valence electrons.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-the-law-of-octaves>Why is it called the law of octaves?</h2>
<p>In the year 1866, an English scientist, John Newlands arranged the elements in the order of increasing atomic masses. He noticed that every eighth element exhibits similar properties as compared to the first element. He called this law as the ‘Law of Octaves’ better known as ‘Newland’s Law of Octaves’.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-dmitry-mendeleev-contribute-to-the-development-of-russia>What did Dmitry Mendeleev contribute to the development of Russia?</h2>
<p>RT.com / RT projects / Russiapedia / Prominent Russians / Science and technology / Dmitry Mendeleev. February 8, 1834 – February 2, 1907. Mostly known in the West for creating the Periodic Table of Elements, Dmitry Mendeleev’s contribution to the development of Russia is huge.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-dmitri-mendeleev-organize-the-63-elements>How did Dmitri Mendeleev organize the 63 elements?</h2>
<p>By arranging all of the 63 elements then known by their atomic weights, he managed to organize them into groups possessing similar properties. Where a gap existed in the table, he predicted a new element would one day be found and deduced its properties. And he was right.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-dmitri-mendeleev-come-up-with-the-idea-of-patience>How did Dmitri Mendeleev come up with the idea of patience?</h2>
<p>Mendeleev was said to have been inspired by the card game known as solitaire in North America, and “patience” elsewhere. In the game, cards are arranged both by suit, horizontally, and by number, vertically. To put some order into his study of chemical elements, Mendeleev made up a set of cards, one for each of the 63 elements known at the time.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-inventions-did-mendeleev-come-up-with>How many inventions did Mendeleev come up with?</h2>
<p>It is often considered his greatest achievement and in 1863, there were just 56 known elements. New ones were being discovered about once per year, but Mendeleev didn’t know that work was going on.</p>
