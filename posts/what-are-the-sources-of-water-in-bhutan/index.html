<h2 id=does-bhutan-have-water>Does Bhutan have water?</h2>
<p>Bhutan is a country rich in natural resources, and relative to most other nations has an abundance of fresh water in terms of per-capita availability. Water plays an essential role in all four of Bhutan’s major economic drivers – agriculture, hydropower, tourism and small-scale industry.</p>
<h2 id=which-river-flows-in-bhutan>Which river flows in Bhutan?</h2>

<h2 id=how-can-we-save-water-in-bhutan>How can we save water in Bhutan?</h2>
<p>As land-use has direct impact on water cycle, it is crucial that land-use planning take place at the river basin level. The upstream-downstream relationship has impact on the management of water resources. Therefore, water resource management in Bhutan shall be based on natural river basins.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-freshwater-shortages-in-bhutan>What causes freshwater shortages in Bhutan?</h2>
<p>The problem of water shortage has been increasing in Bhutan over the years. Climate change could be contributing to the drying up of water sources. That is why growing cities like Thimphu and Phuentsholing are running short of water. In the rural areas, people have no water to drink and to irrigate their fields.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-longest-river-in-bhutan>Which is the longest river in Bhutan?</h2>
<p>Manas<br>
The Manas and all its main branches, including all its tributaries, constitutes the largest river system in Bhutan, with a total length of 3 200 km. The main Manas, or Gong River drains about 18 300 km2 in eastern Bhutan, rising beyond the Great Himalayan range.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-book-about-water-in-bhutan>Which is the best book about water in Bhutan?</h2>
<p>This book ‘Water: Securing Bhutan’s Future’ provides picturesque views of water resources of Bhutan while presenting the government’s commitments, plans and efforts towards water security.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-minerals-are-found-in-bhutan>What kind of minerals are found in Bhutan?</h2>
<p>The country’s mineral industry was small and insignificant to its economy and was dominated by the production of cement, coal, dolomite, gypsum, and limestone. Known resources included deposits of beryl, copper, graphite, lead, mica, pyrite, tin, tungsten, and zinc.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-bhutan-so-important-to-the-world>Why is Bhutan so important to the world?</h2>
<p>Bhutan is in a region that provides water for one-fifth of the world’s population. Bhutan also is at the heart of the Eastern Himalayas, which is one of the world’s 10-most biodiverse regions. And Bhutan’s forests help keep the world’s climate change at bay by absorbing carbon dioxide.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-iwrm-important-to-bhutans-future>Why is the IWRM important to Bhutan’s future?</h2>
<p>Recognizing that the water system is the inevitable entry point for addressing climate change, IWRM serves as a foundation upon which the planning and implementation of climate resilience is being pursued in Bhutan. The goal is to achieve sustainable water security for the beneﬁt of all stakeholders.</p>
