<h2 id=what-are-the-energy-resources-in-china>What are the energy resources in China?</h2>
<p>Hydro-electric power and biomass are two major renewable energy sources used in China; the application of other renewable energy sources such as solar heating and wind power are relatively insignificant.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-china-have-the-highest-energy-use>Why does China have the highest energy use?</h2>
<p>Voracious energy demand also helps explain why China—which gets most of its electricity from coal, the most polluting of fossil fuels—passed the U.S. in 2007 as the world’s largest emitter of carbon-dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases.</p>
<h2 id=does-china-use-more-or-less-energy-than-the-us>Does China use more or less energy than the US?</h2>
<p>Global primary energy consumption by country 2020 China is the largest consumer of primary energy in the world, using some 145.46 exajoules in 2020. This is far more than was consumed by the United States, which ranks second. The majority of primary energy fuels is still derived from fossil fuels such as oil and coal.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-consumes-the-most-power>Which country consumes the most power?</h2>
<p>China<br>
China consumes the most electricity of any country in the world. The United States ranks as the second-largest electricity consumer, at 4,194 terawatt hours in 2019 and was followed by India at a significant margin. Most energy generated in China is sourced from coal.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-uses-the-least-electricity>Which country uses the least electricity?</h2>
<p>Among OECD nations, Iceland, Canada and South Korea are the most energy-intensive, while Estonia, Ireland and the U.K. are the least.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-china-use-more-energy-than-the-us>Why does China use more energy than the US?</h2>
<p>Energy use is closely related to carbon dioxide emissions, economic expansion and the global balance of power. The bulk of China’s energy demand comes from industry and infrastructure, but individual consumption is also rising, albeit from a low base.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-important-energy-source-in-china>Which is the most important energy source in China?</h2>
<p>Hydroelectricity is one of China’s most important energy sources since it is the country’s largest and most valuable renewable energy source. The Chinese government has facilitated the growth of the hydropower sector to ensure that China has sufficient energy to meet its energy requirements.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-percentage-of-renewable-energy-in-china>What’s the percentage of renewable energy in China?</h2>
<p>In early 2020, renewable energy comprised about 40% of China’s total installed electric power capacity, and 26% of total power generation—with solar and wind combined having more capacity than hydropower. Nevertheless, the share of renewable sources in the energy mix had been gradually rising in recent years.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-percentage-of-natural-gas-in-china>What’s the percentage of natural gas in China?</h2>
<p>This statistic shows the energy consumption in China from 2009 to 2019, by source. In 2019, the share of natural gas in the energy consumption in China amounted to 8.1 percent. You need a Single Account for unlimited access. Add this content to your personal favorites.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-consumer-of-coal-in-china>Which is the largest consumer of coal in China?</h2>
<p>China’s industrial sector is by far the largest consumer of coal. In 2017, the industrial sector accounted for around two thirds of China’s total energy consumption and consumed about 95 percent of the country’s coal. China’s dependence on coal for industrial power generation has significantly contributed to urban air pollution.</p>
