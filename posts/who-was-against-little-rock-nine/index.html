<h2 id=who-was-against-little-rock-nine>Who was against Little Rock Nine?</h2>
<p>Two pro-segregation groups formed to oppose the plan: The Capital Citizens Council and the Mother’s League of Central High School.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-governor-of-arkansas-respond-to-integration>How did the governor of Arkansas respond to integration?</h2>
<p>Governor Orval Faubus ordered the Arkansas National Guard to prevent African American students from enrolling at Central High School. Governor Faubus defied this decision. He also defied a 1955 ruling (Brown II). The 1955 decision ordered that public schools be desegregated with all deliberate speed.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-lost-year-in-arkansas>When was the lost year in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>The Lost Year was the aftermath of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School in 1957–58, the main event in a series that marked the well-known civil rights battle fought between the federal and state governments over the Arkansas implementation of the 1954 Brown v.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-governor-of-arkansas-who-prevented-desegregation>Who was the Governor of Arkansas who prevented desegregation?</h2>
<p>Arkansas troops prevent desegregation. Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus enlists the National Guard to prevent nine African American students from entering Central High School in Little Rock.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-governor-of-arkansas-during-the-little-rock-nine>Who was the Governor of Arkansas during the Little Rock Nine?</h2>
<p>Arkansas governor Orval Faubus enlists the National Guard to prevent nine African American students from entering Central High School in Little Rock.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-integration-in-little-rock>When was the first integration in Little Rock?</h2>
<p>In 1957, the first major confrontation over this decision came when African American students attempted to integrate Central High School in Little Rock. After Governor Faubus surrounded the school with Arkansas National Guard troops, a showdown with federal officials ensued.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-arkansas-troops-block-the-little-rock-nine>Why did the Arkansas troops block the Little Rock Nine?</h2>
<p>Arkansas troops prevent desegregation. Faubus took the action in violation of a federal order to integrate the school. The conflict set the stage for the first major test of the U.S. Supreme Court’s unanimous 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka that racial segregation in educational facilities is unconstitutional.</p>
