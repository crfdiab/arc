<h2 id=what-divided-the-federalists-and-the-anti-federalists>What divided the Federalists and the anti-Federalists?</h2>
<p>The Federalists felt that this addition wasn’t necessary, because they believed that the Constitution as it stood only limited the government not the people. The Anti- Federalists claimed the Constitution gave the central government too much power, and without a Bill of Rights the people would be at risk of oppression.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-biggest-difference-between-the-federalist-and-the-anti-federalist>What was the biggest difference between the Federalist and the Anti Federalist?</h2>
<p>Those who supported the Constitution and a stronger national republic were known as Federalists. Those who opposed the ratification of the Constitution in favor of small localized government were known as Anti-Federalists. The Anti-Federalists argued against the expansion of national power.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-anti-federalists-most-opposed-to>What were anti-Federalists most opposed to?</h2>
<p>The anti-Federalists and their opposition to ratifying the Constitution were a powerful force in the origin of the Bill of Rights to protect Amercians’ civil liberties. The anti-Federalists were chiefly concerned with too much power invested in the national government at the expense of states.</p>
<h2 id=what-groups-were-anti-federalists>What groups were anti-Federalists?</h2>
<p>Ranging from political elites like James Winthrop in Massachusetts to Melancton Smith of New York and Patrick Henry and George Mason of Virginia, these Antifederalist were joined by a large number of ordinary Americans particularly yeomen farmers who predominated in rural America.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-key-differences-between-an-anti-federalist-and-a-federalist>What are 3 key differences between an anti federalist and a federalist?</h2>
<p>The Federalists wanted a strong government and strong executive branch, while the anti-Federalists wanted a weaker central government. The Federalists did not want a bill of rights —they thought the new constitution was sufficient. The anti-federalists demanded a bill of rights.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-major-differences-between-the-federalists-and-the-anti-federalists>What are two major differences between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists?</h2>
<h2 id=what-was-the-difference-between-anti-federalists-and-federalists>What was the difference between Anti Federalists and Federalists?</h2>
<p>In U.S. history, anti-federalists were those who opposed the development of a strong federal government and the ratification of the Constitution in 1788, preferring instead for power to remain in the hands of state and local governments. Federalists wanted a stronger national government and the ratification…</p>
<h2 id=who-are-some-important-people-in-the-anti-federalist-movement>Who are some important people in the Anti Federalist Movement?</h2>
<p>Prominent Anti-Federalists and Federalists. Alexander Hamilton, a former chief of staff to George Washington, was a proponent of a strong federal government and founded the Federalist Party. He helped oversee the development of a national bank and a taxation system. Other prominent federalists of the time included John Jay and John Adams .</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-federalists-say-about-the-constitution>What did the Federalists say about the Constitution?</h2>
<p>We now know that the Federalists prevailed, and the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1788, and went into effect in 1789. Read about their arguments below. Anti-Federalists argued that the Constitution gave too much power to the federal government, while taking too much power away from state and local governments.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-federalist-party>Who was the leader of the Federalist Party?</h2>
<p>The association between the smallness of size and the extent of republic is one of the great conventions of 18th century political thinking. The frameworks of the constitution, I think, led first and foremost by James Madison turned that proposition upside down.</p>
