<h2 id=what-does-crown-rot-mean>What does crown rot mean?</h2>
<p>Root/crown rot is a general term that describes any disease of woody ornamentals where the pathogen (causal organism) attacks and leads to the deterioration of a plant’s root system and/or lower trunk or branches near the soil line.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-top-of-a-tomato>What is the top of a tomato?</h2>
<p>It’s called the core. Click here to watch a demonstration of its removal. A lot of people leave it in and eat it.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-months-does-tomatoes-take-to-grow>How many months does tomatoes take to grow?</h2>
<p>The short answer is, it can take anywhere from two to three months or even longer, depending on the cultivar, before tomatoes reach harvest stage. Temperatures and other environmental conditions also play a role in the length of time it takes for the fruits to develop and ripen.</p>
<h2 id=is-tomato-a-top-root>Is tomato a top root?</h2>
<p>Seed-grown tomato plants often develop deep taproot systems, reaching 5 feet or more below ground and a few feet wide. When grown from cuttings, tomatoes tend to develop a wide network of fibrous roots which lack the ability to penetrate the soil deeply.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-know-if-my-crown-is-rotting>How do I know if my crown is rotting?</h2>
<p>Signs of Crown Rot Disease Infected areas may be discolored, usually tan or dark colored, which is indicative of dead tissue. As crown rot progresses, the plant will begin to wilt and quickly die, with younger plants being more susceptible to death. Foliage may yellow or even turn a red to purplish color as well.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-know-if-crown-rot>How do you know if crown rot?</h2>
<p>Purpling and reddening of older leaves is a symptom of Phytophthora root rot. Darkened bark and wood tissue is a symptom of Phytophthora crown and root rot. Reddish brown Phytophthora crown rot canker with zonate margin. Stunting and discoloration from Phytophthora root rot on pepper roots.</p>
<h2 id=can-u-eat-a-whole-tomato>Can u eat a whole tomato?</h2>
<p>Like all fruits and vegetables, the nutrients in tomatoes can be impacted by whether or not you cook them. This means that even though tomatoes are a perfectly healthy food to eat raw, you can get just as many nutrients (or even more) by eating tomato products like canned tomatoes.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-cut-the-top-off-of-a-tomato-plant>What happens if you cut the top off of a tomato plant?</h2>
<p>Called “topping,” this type of pruning causes the plant to stop flowering and setting new fruit, and instead directs all sugars to the remaining fruit. This way, the fruit will ripen faster, plus it becomes more likely that the green tomatoes you pick before frost will actually ripen when you bring them indoors.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-tomatoes-grow-for-beginners>How do tomatoes grow for beginners?</h2>
<p>To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed weekly with a high-potash fertiliser once the plants start to flower. Tomatoes are split into two main growing types: determinate (bush) and indeterminate (cordon).</p>
<h2 id=how-many-times-do-tomato-plants-produce-fruit>How many times do tomato plants produce fruit?</h2>
<p>So, do tomato plants bear fruit more than once? Indeterminate varieties of tomato plants can bear fruit more than once, producing fruit until frost. Determinate tomato varieties usually only produce one tomato harvest in a season.</p>
<h2 id=is-rice-a-taproot-or-fibrous-root>Is Rice a taproot or fibrous root?</h2>
<p>Rice is characterized into fibrous root system.</p>
<h2 id=how-deep-is-the-root-system-of-a-tomato-plant>How deep is the root system of a tomato plant?</h2>
<p>The root system of a tomato plant might extend to as much as 2 feet deep, but the main portion of the root system lies in the first 12 inches under the soil. Because the roots lie close to the surface, it is important to dig carefully around tomato plants so you don’t damage the roots.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-growing-tomatoes-in-canada>What do you need to know about growing tomatoes in Canada?</h2>
<p>Redawna tells you everything you need to know for growing tomatoes in Canada. One of the most rewarding moments in gardening is when you enjoy your first vine-ripened tomato picked straight from the plant, still warm from the sun. A tomato grown by you.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-a-crack-in-the-stem-of-a-tomato>What causes a crack in the stem of a tomato?</h2>
<p>Cracks usually affect the stem end of the tomato (the entry point of water into the fruit). There are two types of cracks: When do tomato affect fruit? Can I eat cracked tomatoes? Yes. Pick a cracked tomato as soon as possible to avoid infection. When preparing a cracked tomato, simply cut out affected parts.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-tomatoes-are-in-a-can-of-tomatoes>What kind of tomatoes are in a can of tomatoes?</h2>
<p>What’s in a Can of Tomatoes? Every kind of canned tomato starts the same way: with freshly-picked tomatoes (usually plum tomatoes) that are peeled, cooked, and processed shortly after they’re harvested in order to retain that ripe, red flavor they have at their peak.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-bottom-of-a-tomato-plant-look-like>What does the bottom of a tomato plant look like?</h2>
<p>What it looks like: As tomatoes ripen, a dark, bull’s-eye circle appears on the blossom end or bottom of the tomato. The spot is sunken and mushy to the touch. When you slice into the tomato, there’s a black mushy spot underneath that looks like rot. What causes it: A fungus called Colletotrichum phomoides.</p>
