<h2 id=where-was-the-polish-corridor>Where was the Polish Corridor?</h2>
<p>a strip of land near the mouth of the Vistula River: formerly separated Germany from East Prussia; given to Poland in the Treaty of Versailles 1919 to provide it with access to the Baltic.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-poland-get-danzig>Why did Poland get Danzig?</h2>
<p>Danzig and the so-called Polish Corridor ensured Poland’s access to the Baltic Sea, but they also separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany. He also wanted German-controlled transportation lines to be built across the corridor in order to connect East Prussia with the rest of Germany.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-countries-that-make-up-the-baltic-sea>Who are the countries that make up the Baltic Sea?</h2>
<p>Proceeding clockwise from the west, the countries bounding the Baltic are Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Germany. The Baltic Sea is a shrunken remnant of the water-covered region that emerged as the melting Scandinavian ice sheet retreated toward the Arctic at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch glaciations.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-soviet-union-use-the-baltic-states>How did the Soviet Union use the Baltic states?</h2>
<p>The Soviet Union took advantage of their strategic location on the Baltic Sea by establishing naval bases in all three Baltic nations. Tens of thousands of people were expelled from their homelands. Nationalist symbols were removed from public view. Resistance, whether violent or not, was forcefully put down.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-baltic-ice-lake>What was the cause of the Baltic Ice Lake?</h2>
<p>The lake followed a period of massive glaciation in the region, which followed the end of the Eemian Sea. The post-glacial Yoldia Sea was immediately subsequent to the Baltic Ice Lake. Post-glacial sea level, combined with isostatic rebound, resulted in a sequence of Baltic lakes and seas.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-baltic-sea-drain-into-the-atlantic>Where does the Baltic Sea drain into the Atlantic?</h2>
<p>The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude. A marginal sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two water bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish islands into the Kattegat by way of the straits of Øresund, the Great Belt and the Little Belt.</p>
