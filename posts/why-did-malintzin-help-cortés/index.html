<h2 id=why-did-malintzin-help-cortés>Why did Malintzin help Cortés?</h2>
<p>Malinche soon proved herself very useful to Cortes, as she was able to help him interpret Nahuatl, the language of the mighty Aztec Empire. Malinche was an invaluable asset for Cortes, as she not only translated but also helped him understand local cultures and politics.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-malinche-betray>Who did Malinche betray?</h2>
<p>Meet the Woman Who Betrayed the Aztecs A young native princess named Malinali from the town of Painala was sold into enslavement sometime between 1500 and 1518.</p>
<h2 id=who-helped-hernán-cortés-defeat-aztecs>Who helped Hernán Cortés defeat Aztecs?</h2>
<p>La Malinche<br>
La Malinche helped Cortés manipulate Montezuma and rule Tenochtitlán through him. “It is also said that she informed Cortés of an Aztec plot to destroy his army,” Cosme said. The Spanish army had help in sacking the city.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-hernán-cortés-impact-of-expedition>What was Hernán Cortés impact of expedition?</h2>
<p>His greatest impact in history is that he established a firm Spanish presence in the New World after conquering the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. The impact that he had on the native populations was very negative. He introduced smallpox to Mexico with devastating consequences.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-greatest-contribution-of-malinche-to-cortés>What was the greatest contribution of Malinche to Cortés?</h2>
<p>Marina [maˈɾina] or Malintzin [maˈlintsin] (c. 1500 – c. 1529), more popularly known as La Malinche [la maˈlintʃe], was a Nahua woman from the Mexican Gulf Coast known for contributing to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, by acting as an interpreter, advisor, and intermediary for the Spanish conquistador Hernán …</p>
<h2 id=why-was-malinche-viewed-as-a-traitor>Why was Malinche viewed as a traitor?</h2>
<p>Several accounts indicate that La Malinche was also responsible for foiling more than one Aztec plan to attack Cortes and the Spanish army. Understandably, many Mexicans regard La Malinche as a traitor. Her role as an interpreter has often been sullied by this perception.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-hernan-cortes-change-malitzens-life>How did Hernan Cortes change malitzen’s life?</h2>
<p>In 1519, Malitzen’s life was forever changed by the arrival of Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés. When he arrived at the city of Pontonchan, the city leaders gave him twenty enslaved women as a peace offering. Malitzen was one of the women given to Cortés.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-martin-cortes-son-of-la-malinche>Who was Martin Cortes, son of La Malinche?</h2>
<p>Martín Cortés (son of Malinche) Martín Cortés el Mestizo (Spanish pronunciation: [maɾˈtiŋ koɾˈtes el mesˈtiθo]; c. 1523 – c. 1595) was the first-born and illegitimate son of Hernán Cortés and La Malinche (doña Marina), the conquistador’s indigenous interpreter and concubine.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-native-woman-who-helped-hernan-cortes-conquer-mexico>Who was the native woman who helped Hernan Cortes conquer Mexico?</h2>
<p>The Controversial Story Of La Malinche, The Native Mesoamerican Who Helped Hernán Cortés Take Over Mexico Also known as “Doña Marina,” La Malinche advised Hernán Cortés to victory over the Aztecs — but perhaps she had little choice in the matter.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-malitzen-do-to-help-the-spanish>What did malitzen do to help the Spanish?</h2>
<p>With Malitzen’s help and guidance, Cortés was able to make alliances with tribes who were tired of Aztec rule. She uncovered plots to betray the Spanish, giving Cortés time to stop them before their enemies did any serious damage.</p>
