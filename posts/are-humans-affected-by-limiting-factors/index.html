<h2 id=are-humans-affected-by-limiting-factors>Are humans affected by limiting factors?</h2>
<p>All living populations possess a tendency for growth. Simultaneously, these populations encounter limitations to that potential. Some factors affecting human population growth (and other organisms’ population growth) include predation, disease, scarcity of vital resources, natural disasters and an inimical environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-limiting-factors-in-space>What are the limiting factors in space?</h2>
<p>Some examples of limiting factors are biotic, like food, mates, and competition with other organisms for resources. Others are abiotic, like space, temperature, altitude, and amount of sunlight available in an environment.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-a-limiting-factor-affect-the-population-living-in-a-place>How can a limiting factor affect the population living in a place?</h2>
<p>Carrying Capacity If a population is small and resources are plentiful, a population may grow quickly. But over time, because of limiting factors, population growth tends to slow and then stop. The population has reached the “carrying capacity” of the ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-limiting-factors-in-a-habitat>What are the limiting factors in a habitat?</h2>
<p>There can be many different limiting factors at work in a single habitat, and the same limiting factors can affect the populations of both plant and animal species. Ultimately, limiting factors determine a habitat’s carrying capacity, which is the maximum size of the population it can support.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-changing-ocean-chemistry-affect-marine-life>How does changing ocean chemistry affect marine life?</h2>
<p>Laboratory studies suggest changing ocean chemistry will 1) harm life forms that rely on carbonate-based shells and skeletons, 2) harm organisms sensitive to acidity and 3) harm organisms higher up the food chain that feed on these sensitive organisms.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-limiting-factor>Which is an example of a limiting factor?</h2>
<p>Some examples of limiting factors are biotic, like food, mates, and competition with other organisms for resources. Others are abiotic, like space, temperature, altitude, and amount of sunlight available in an environment. Limiting factors are usually expressed as a lack of a particular resource.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-organisms-affected-by-increased-acidity-in-the-ocean>How are organisms affected by increased acidity in the ocean?</h2>
<p>Organisms can often compensate when faced with increased acidity, but this comes at the expense of using energy to grow critical body parts like muscle or shell. For example, scientists have found that mussels, sea urchins, and crabs start to dissolve their protective shells to counter elevated acidity in their body fluids.</p>
