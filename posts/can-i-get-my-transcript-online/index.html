<p>To get your transcripts years after graduating from high school or college, you can call your school and request them, order them online from your school’s website or use a third-party website to have unofficial or official transcripts sent to you or sent to the institution of your choice.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-find-my-transcript>How do I find my transcript?</h2>

To view and print your transcripts online, go to IRS.gov and use the Get Transcript tool. To order by phone, call 800-908-9946 and follow the prompts.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-get-a-transcript>How do I get a transcript?</h2>
<p>To get an official copy of your transcript, contact your school’s registrar. In most cases, you don’t even have to call or go in person; the registrar’s office may have an online form for requesting your transcript. You can usually pay the transcript fee online too.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-get-a-hold-on-my-transcript>How do I get a hold on my transcript?</h2>
<p>There are four strategies to free up your transcript:</p>
