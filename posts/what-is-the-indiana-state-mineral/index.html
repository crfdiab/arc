<h2 id=why-is-indianas-state-stone-limestone>Why is Indiana’s state stone limestone?</h2>
<p>Invertebrate bryozoans, brachiopods, corals, and echino- derms (especially crinoids) flourished in the tropical waters. The calcium carbonate shells and other hard body parts that they left behind formed into thick deposits of limestone. It is this limestone that is a vital economic resource to the state.</p>
<h2 id=what-crystals-are-native-to-indiana>What crystals are native to Indiana?</h2>
<p>Hoosier National Forest is one of the state’s best geode locations, and it’s home to large amounts of quartz and other crystals. Balrite, Dolomite, and White Calcite are some of the most common crystals found in the area.</p>
<h2 id=what-gems-are-found-in-indiana>What gems are found in Indiana?</h2>

<p>Indiana Limestone is known as Salem Limestone, after the exposed areas of stone located near Salem, Indiana. Salem Limestone is incredibly chemically pure—it is about 97 percent calcium carbonate. Limestone was designated Indiana’s state stone in 1971.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-diamonds-in-indiana>Are there diamonds in Indiana?</h2>
<p>Yes, there are actually Diamonds to be found in Indiana, along with small amounts of gold. Though certainly not in economic proportions, diamonds as large as 4 carats (Brown County) have been found. Gold, in contrast to diamonds, has been found in relative abundance in the Hoosier state.</p>
