<p>The Star-Spangled Banner<br>
On September 14, 1814, Francis Scott Key pens a poem which is later set to music and in 1931 becomes America’s national anthem, “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The poem, originally titled “The Defence of Fort M’Henry,” was written after Key witnessed the Maryland fort being bombarded by the British during the War of 1812.</p>

The resolution did not pass until it was reintroduced to Congress in 1930. It was officially adopted by law on March 3, 1931. Other songs that were possible contenders for the position as national anthem were “Hail, Columbia,” “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee,” and “America the Beautiful.”</p>

<p>The flag represents that unity, as does the National Anthem. In this way, America represents the ultimate marriage. Rather, we’re up and joining the sea of like-minded people who believe that being American is something to celebrate.</p>

India’s National Anthem, ‘Jana Gana Mana’, is an adoption from the writings of the poet and playwright, Rabindranath Tagore.</p>

<h2 id=where-did-the-song-the-national-anthem-come-from>Where did the song the national anthem come from?</h2>
<p>Key was inspired by the large American flag, the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the American victory. The poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men’s social club in London.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-only-country-to-have-two-national-anthems>Which is the only country to have two national anthems?</h2>
<p>The tune is the same but the lyrics have different meanings. South Africa’s national anthem is unique in that it is two different songs put together with five of the country’s eleven official languages being used, in which each language comprises a stanza. Only United Nations member states and observer states are included in this table.</p>
