<h2 id=what-was-the-red-sea-originally-called>What was the Red Sea originally called?</h2>
<p>Erythraean Sea<br>
Red Sea is a direct translation of the Greek Erythra Thalassa (Ερυθρὰ Θάλασσα). The sea itself was once referred to as the Erythraean Sea by Europeans. As well as Mare Rubrum in Latin (alternatively Sinus Arabicus, literally “Arabian Gulf”), the Romans called it Pontus Herculis (Sea of Hercules).</p>
<h2 id=is-the-red-sea-in-egypt-actually-red>Is the Red Sea in Egypt actually red?</h2>
<p>Normally, the Red Sea is an intense blue-green; occasionally, however, it is populated by extensive blooms of the algae Trichodesmium erythraeum, which, upon dying off, turn the sea a reddish brown colour.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-red-sea-turn-red>Why did the Red Sea turn red?</h2>
<p>Located between the East African coast and the Saudi Arabian peninsula, the Red Sea got its name because of a type of algae called Trichodesmium erythraeum, which is found in the sea. When these blooms of algae die off they appear to turn the blue-green color of the ocean to a reddish-brown.</p>
<h2 id=why-red-sea-is-called-so>Why Red Sea is called so?</h2>
<p>Why is the Red Sea red? The Red Sea’s name is a direct translation of its ancient Greek name, Erythra Thalassa. A popular hypotheses about the origins of the Red Sea’s name is that it contains a cyanobacteria called Trichodesmium erythraeum, which turns the normally blue-green water a reddish-brown.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-red-sea-called-thered-sea>Why is the Red Sea called the’red sea’?</h2>
<p>The Red Sea’s name is a direct translation of its ancient Greek name, Erythra Thalassa. However, only European languages include any mention of “red.” In Hebrew it is called Yam Suph, or Sea of Reeds, most likely due to the reeds of the Gulf of Suez, and in Egypt it is called “Green Space.”</p>
<h2 id=is-the-red-sea-mentioned-in-the-old-testament>Is the Red Sea mentioned in the Old Testament?</h2>
<p>In fact, nowhere in the entire Old Testament Hebrew text is the body of water associated with the exodus ever called the “Red Sea.” Instead in the Hebrew text the reference is to the yam suph.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-red-sea>What happens at the end of the Red Sea?</h2>
<p>What Really Happened at the Red Sea? After years of devastating slavery, God aided Moses in leading the Israelites out of Egypt. Several days after the Exodus, the erstwhile slaves reached the banks of the Red Sea, also called the Sea of Reeds. They felt trapped and saw no escape.</p>
