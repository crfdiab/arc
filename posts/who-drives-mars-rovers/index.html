<p>Verma has been driving rovers on Mars since 2008, living between two different worlds while seeing the missions evolve over time.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-curiosity-rover>What happened to the Curiosity rover?</h2>
<p>The rover is still operational as of February 2021 and it has been on Mars for 3034 sols (3117 Earth days) since landing on the 6th of August in the year 2012. Curiosity’s rover design serves as the basis for NASA’s 2021 Perseverance mission, which carries different scientific instruments.</p>

<p>Indeed, this dangerous terrain required Perseverance to make the most precise Red Planet touchdown ever. The rover’s landing ellipse was just 4.8 miles long by 4.1 miles wide (7.7 by 6.6 kilometers), compared to 4 miles by 12 miles (7 by 12 km) for Curiosity.</p>

<p>Frank Searle and Spencer Wilks set about reorganising the company and moving it upmarket to cater for people who wanted something “superior” to Fords and Austins. In 1930 Spencer Wilks was joined by his brother, Maurice, who had also been at Hillman as chief engineer.</p>

<p>“We’re usually all in one room, sharing screens, images and data. People are talking in small groups and to each other from across the room,” said Alicia Allbaugh, who leads the team. Now the team collaborates by holding several conferences at once and using messaging apps.</p>
