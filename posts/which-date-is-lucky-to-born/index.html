<h2 id=how-do-i-know-my-lucky-day>How do I know my lucky day?</h2>
<p>In order to find what days of the month will be lucky for you, you have to add your birthday number to the number of a calendar day. When you find a date that adds up to the exact number that your birthday adds up to, you’ve got a lucky day.</p>

<h2 id=which-month-is-best-to-marry>Which month is best to marry?</h2>
<p>June, September, and October are considered the best months for a wedding. June, traditionally, is the most popular month to get married, simply because of the mild weather.
