<h2 id=who-immigrated-first-to-new-york>Who immigrated first to New York?</h2>
<p>The Dutch were the first immigrants to what was then New Amsterdam and made the first inroads to building Manhattan to what it is today. The Dutch brought slaves from Africa, and German immigration began heavily in the 1700s. By the mid-1800s the Irish came to New York City to escape the Great Famine.</p>
<h2 id=who-lived-in-new-york-before-european-settlers>Who lived in New York before European settlers?</h2>
<p>Prior to Europeans arriving in New York, the land was inhabited by Native Americans. There were two major groups of Native Americans: the Iroquois and the Algonquian peoples. The Iroquois formed an alliance of tribes called the Five Nations which included the Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, Onondaga, and the Seneca.</p>

<p>In 1613, the Dutch established a trading post on the western shore of Manhattan Island. Jan Rodrigues was the first documented non-native to live on Manhattan Island. In 1614 the New Netherland company was established, and consequently they settled a second fur trading post in what is today Albany, called Fort Nassau.</p>
<h2 id=what-native-american-tribes-lived-in-western-new-york>What Native American tribes lived in Western New York?</h2>
<p>In keeping with regional protocol, I would like to start by acknowledging the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee and by honoring the sovereignty of the Six Nations–the Mohawk, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca and Tuscarora–and their land where we are situated and where the majority of this work took place.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-european-born-in-new-york-city>Who was the first European born in New York City?</h2>
<p>Sarah Rapalje (b.1625) was the first European born in the future New York City. Later in 1626, Peter Minuit purchased Manhattan Island and Staten Island from native people in exchange for trade goods.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-people-settle-in-new-york>When did the first people settle in New York?</h2>
<p>In 1664, the English conquered the area and renamed it New York. Archaeological excavations indicate that the first humans settled the area as early as 9,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-indigenous-people-of-new-york>Who are the indigenous people of New York?</h2>
<p>The Indigenous People of New York. The names of the New York tribes included the Delaware, Erie, Iroquois, Mohawk, Oneida and Seneca. When the first European explorer sailed into New York harbor in 1524, the native civilization found on the banks of the Hudson was a complex and ancient one. The natives’ ancestors had entered …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-new-york-city-in-1897>What was the population of New York City in 1897?</h2>
<p>As a result, on December 31, 1897, New York City had an area of 60 square miles and a population of a little more than 2 million people; on January 1, 1898, when the consolidation plan took effect, New York City had an area of 360 square miles and a population of about 3,350,000 people.</p>
