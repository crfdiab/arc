<h2 id=what-rules-did-serfs-have-to-follow>What rules did serfs have to follow?</h2>
<p>Neither could the serf marry, change his occupation, or dispose of his property without his lord’s permission. He was bound to his designated plot of land and could be transferred along with that land to a new lord. Serfs were often harshly treated and had little legal redress against the actions of their lords.</p>
<h2 id=did-serfs-have-any-rights>Did serfs have any rights?</h2>
<p>Serfs, however, were legally people—though they had far fewer rights than free peasants (poor farmers of low social status). Serfs’ movements were constrained, their property rights were limited, and they owed rents of all sorts to their landlords.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-main-duties-of-serfs>What were the main duties of serfs?</h2>
<p>The most important task of serfs was to work on the demesne land of their lord for two or three days each week, and more during busy periods like harvest time. All of the food produced from that land went to the lord.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-serfs-in-medieval-times>What was the role of serfs in medieval times?</h2>
<p>The villeins, or serfs, who were occupants on the land, were given the right to cultivate some of the Lord’s land for their own benefit in exchange for their labor in tilling the remainder of the land for the benefit of the Feudal Lord.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-feudal-lords-get-out-of-serfdom>How did feudal lords get out of serfdom?</h2>
<p>If a Feudal Lord were to sell one of his manors to another Nobleman, it included not only the land, livestock, and working tools, but the serfs on the land as well. The only escape from serfdom on the Manor was to successfully go to and hide in one of the Medieval walled cities for one year and a day.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-difficult-thing-about-being-a-serf>What was the most difficult thing about being a serf?</h2>
<p>A major difficulty of a serf’s life was that his work for his lord coincided with, and took precedence over, the work he had to perform on his own lands: when the lord’s crops were ready to be harvested, so were his own.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-villeins-different-from-other-forms-of-serfdom>How are villeins different from other forms of serfdom?</h2>
<p>Villeins were somehow retained on their land and by unmentioned manners could not move away without their lord’s consent and the acceptance of the lord to whose manor they proposed to migrate to. Villeins were generally able to hold their own property, unlike slaves. Villeinage, as opposed to other forms of serfdom,…</p>
