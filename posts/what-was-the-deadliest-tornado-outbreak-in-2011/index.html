<h2 id=what-was-the-deadliest-tornado-outbreak-in-2011>What was the deadliest tornado outbreak in 2011?</h2>
<p>During a 4-day period from April 25-28, 2011, more than 200 tornadoes occurred in a five southeastern states. The deadliest part of the outbreak was on April 27, when a total of 122 tornadoes resulted in 319 deaths.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-tornado-outbreak-in-mississippi-in-2011>Where was the tornado outbreak in Mississippi in 2011?</h2>
<p>Later that morning, the SPC even increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along a corridor from Meridian, Mississippi, to Huntsville, Alabama, an extremely rare issuance exceeding the high risk standards. Conditions became increasingly favorable for tornadoes during such an extreme tornado outbreak.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-tornado-hit-stlouis-in-2011>When did tornado hit St.Louis in 2011?</h2>
<p>On April 22, 2011, two supercell thunderstorms crossed the St. Louis metropolitan area bringing large hail, strong winds, and five tornadoes, including one ranked EF4.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-there-was-a-tornado-in-april>When was the last time there was a tornado in April?</h2>
<p>The previous April record was 267 tornadoes, which occurred in April 1974, and the record for any month was May 2003, when there were 542 confirmed tornadoes. The 30-year average for number of April tornadoes is 135.</p>

<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-a-tornado-was-rated-a-f5>When was the last time a tornado was rated a F5?</h2>
<p>For United States tornadoes as of February 1, 2007, the Fujita scale has been recalibrated to more accurately match tornado speeds with their damage and to augment and refine damage descriptors. The new system is called the Enhanced Fujita scale. No earlier tornadoes will be reclassified, and no new tornadoes in the United States will be rated F5.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-ef5-tornadoes-in-the-united-states>Are there any EF5 tornadoes in the United States?</h2>
<p>Since the implementation of the Enhanced Fujita scale on February 1, 2007, there have been nine officially rated EF5 tornadoes in the United States from May 4th, 2007-May 20th, 2013 to date, while previously fifty tornadoes were officially rated F5 on the original Fujita scale from May 11th, 1953-May 3rd, 1999.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-record-number-of-tornadoes-in-a-year>What was the record number of tornadoes in a year?</h2>
<p>Due mostly to several extremely large tornado outbreaks in the middle and end of April and in late May, the year finished well above average in almost every category, with six EF5 tornadoes and nearly enough total tornado reports to eclipse the mark of 1,817 tornadoes recorded in 2004, the current record year for total number of tornadoes.</p>
