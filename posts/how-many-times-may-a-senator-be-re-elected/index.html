<h2 id=how-many-times-may-a-senator-be-re-elected>How many times may a Senator be re elected?</h2>
<p>A Senate term is six years long, so senators may choose to run for reelection every six years unless they are appointed or elected in a special election to serve the remainder of a term.</p>

<p>Unless the U.S. Constitution is amended to set term limits on U.S. Senators and/or U.S. Representatives (or an individual state sets term limits on its own U.S. Senators and U.S. Representatives), they can return to Washington as many times as the voters desire.

<p>Members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms and are considered for reelection every even year. Senators however, serve six-year terms and elections to the Senate are staggered over even years so that only about 1/3 of the Senate is up for reelection during any election.</p>

<p>In the 1990’s, many states passed term limits for members of Congress, but the U.S Supreme Court declared them all unconstitutional in U.S. Term Limits v Thornton. The court said the U.S. Constitution sets forth the qualifications, and neither congress nor the states can add to them.</p>
