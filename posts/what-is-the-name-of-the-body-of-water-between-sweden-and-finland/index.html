<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-body-of-water-between-sweden-and-finland>What is the name of the body of water between Sweden and Finland?</h2>
<p>Baltic Sea<br>
Bay of Bothnia, Swedish Bottenviken, Finnish Perämeri, gulf forming the northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia, the northern arm of the Baltic Sea, which lies between Finland and Sweden.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-gulf-between-finland-and-estonia>What is the Gulf between Finland and Estonia?</h2>
<p>Covering an area of 30,000 km2, the Gulf of Finland is the easternmost extension of the Baltic Sea located in Northern Europe. It is bordered by Finland in the north, Russia in the east and Estonia in the south. The Gulf of Finland’s southern coast was designated a Ramsar Wetland on September 13, 1994.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-gulf-of-finland>Where is Gulf of Finland?</h2>
<p>Gulf of Finland, Finnish Suomen Lahti, Russian Finsky Zaliv, easternmost arm of the Baltic Sea, between Finland (north) and Russia and Estonia (east and south).</p>
<h2 id=is-the-gulf-of-bothnia-in-finland-or-sweden>Is the Gulf of Bothnia in Finland or Sweden?</h2>
<p>The Gulf of Bothnia ( / ˈbɒθniə /; Finnish: Pohjanlahti; Swedish: Bottniska viken, also divided as Bothnian Bay + Bothnian Sea) is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland ‘s west coast ( Ostrobothnia) and Sweden ‘s east coast ( Westrobothnia and North Bothnia ).</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-baltic-sea-connected-to-the-gulf-of-finland>How is the Baltic Sea connected to the Gulf of Finland?</h2>
<p>The Baltic Sea is subdivided into several regions. The Gulf of Bothnia (including the Bothnia Bay) is on the northern part. The Bothnia Sea forms the gulf’s southern basin. Below the Bothnia Sea is the Aland Sea, connecting the Bothnia Sea to the Baltic Sea proper. The Baltic Sea is connected to St. Petersburg by the Gulf of Finland.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-east-and-south-coasts-of-sweden-located>Where are the east and south coasts of Sweden located?</h2>
<p>The east and south coasts of Sweden lie on the Baltic Sea, which is linked to the North Sea by the narrow and shallow straits of the Kattegat and the Skagerrak. The Gulf of Bothnia, between Sweden and Finland, is the northern-most extension of the Baltic Sea. All of these bodies of water are considered to be extensions of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-aland-islands-in-the-gulf-of-bothnia>Where are the Aland Islands in the Gulf of Bothnia?</h2>
<p>In the south of the gulf lie the Åland Islands, between the Sea of Åland and the Archipelago Sea . Bothnia is a latinization. The Swedish name Bottenviken was originally just Botn (en), with botn being Old Norse for “gulf” or “bay”, which is also the meaning of the second element vik .</p>
