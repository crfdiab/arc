<p>Italy<br>
Biscotto/Origins</p>
<h2 id=who-invented-the-biscotti>Who invented the biscotti?</h2>
<p>The first biscotti, often referred to as Biscotti di Prato, were created in 14th-century Tuscany in the city of Prato and were made from almonds, which were abundant in the region. Because the second baking drew moisture out of the biscuit, it rendered the biscotti hard, sturdy and, importantly, resistant to mold.</p>
<h2 id=do-italians-dunk-biscotti-in-coffee>Do Italians dunk biscotti in coffee?</h2>
<p>Biscotti is one of the most popular foods to dip in your coffee – especially in Italy. In fact, it’s literally designed and baked for dunking in mind. The crunch and density of a good piece of biscotti dipped in a steaming cup of coffee is unmatched.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-italians-call-their-cookies>What do Italians call their cookies?</h2>
<p>biscotto<br>
The Italian word for cookie is biscotto (masculine, plural: biscotti).</p>
<h2 id=what-does-biscotti-taste-like>What does biscotti taste like?</h2>
<p>Crunchy, sweet, nutty biscotti, with a little bit of dried fruit mixed in, is a lovely treat to have with coffee or a sneaky little liqueur after a long lunch. They are easy to make and keep well when stored in an airtight container.</p>
<h2 id=do-italians-eat-biscuits-for-breakfast>Do Italians eat biscuits for breakfast?</h2>
<p>Biscuits are the most popular Italian breakfast food! According to a poll on the breakfast habits of the Italians conducted in 2019 by YouGov Italia, 57% of all Italians eat biscotti first thing in the morning.</p>
<h2 id=what-pairs-well-with-biscotti>What pairs well with biscotti?</h2>
<p>Biscotti goes particularly well with iced lattes and iced chai during the summer. The smooth flavor that milk brings to those drinks is particularly refreshing when paired with the sweet, spiced flavor of biscotti. Try replacing granola with Soft-Baked Biscotti in a parfait.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-italian-bakeries-called>What are Italian bakeries called?</h2>
<p>forno<br>
In Italy, the forno, or bakery, is the place where you buy bread, naturally: You can get bread at the grocery store, too, but the quality is incomparable and Italians are very traditional—they prefer to go to the bakery for their bread.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-popular-pastry-in-italy>What is the most popular pastry in Italy?</h2>
<p>12 Most Famous Italian Cakes and Pastries</p>

<li>5 – Siena Panforte.</li>

<h2 id=do-biscotti-have-a-lot-of-sugar>Do biscotti have a lot of sugar?</h2>
<p>Biscotti contains 20 mg of cholesterol, 70 mg of sodium and 9 g of sugar. Of its 4.5 g of fat, biscotti contains 2 g of saturated fat — 10 percent of the daily value for saturated fat based on a 2,000-calorie diet. A homemade biscotti might contain 20 g of sugar and 5 g of saturated fat.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-healthiest-pastry>What’s the healthiest pastry?</h2>
<p>Even better, switch your pastry from shortcrust or puff to filo. This is the lowest-fat pastry by far, with 2.9g fat per 100g. This compares with 26.2g for puff or 31.4g for shortcrust. Filo is the lowest-calorie option too, and it’s easy to use.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-word-biscotti-come-from-and-why>Where does the word biscotti come from and why?</h2>
<p>The word biscotto derives from “bis,” Latin for twice, and “coctum” or baked (which became “cotto,” or cooked). The Roman biscotti were more about convenience food for travelers rather than a pleasurable treat for leisurely diners.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-name-carquinyoli-biscotti-come-from>Where does the name carquinyoli biscotti come from?</h2>
<p>One Catalan food writer states that carquinyoli is derived from the French croquignole. Croquignole, another name for these biscotti, is a French word of Germanic origin . In North America, where “biscuit” has taken on other meanings, any twice-baked biscuits are likely to be known as biscotti. Chocolate and pistachio biscotti.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-biscotti-is-called-in-argentina>What kind of biscotti is called in Argentina?</h2>
<p>Although commonly used to indicate the biscuits of Prato, biscotti di Prato, in modern Italy and Argentina they are also known widely by the name “cantuccini”.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-biscotti-so-popular-in-the-us>Why are Biscotti so popular in the US?</h2>
<p>In the US the popularity of biscotti has exploded as Americans find them to be natural companions to coffee, ice cream and fruit compote – even as a remarkable crust for cheesecake. Centuries ago, biscotti proved to be an ideal food for soldiers, sailors and fisherman, who needed sustenance while on long journeys.</p>
