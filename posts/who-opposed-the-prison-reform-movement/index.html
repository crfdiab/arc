<h2 id=who-opposed-the-prison-reform-movement>Who opposed the prison reform movement?</h2>
<p>Conservative citizens’ groups opposed indeterminate sentences because of concerns that too many prisoners were being released too early. The tougher stance on crime that took shape during the late 1970s and early 1980s led to more people being imprisoned as well as inmates staying in prison for longer periods.</p>
<h2 id=who-fought-for-prison-reform-in-the-mid-1800s>Who fought for prison reform in the mid 1800s?</h2>
<p>Dorothea Dix<br>
In the 1800s, Dorothea Dix toured prisons in the U.S. and all over Europe looking at the conditions of the mentally handicapped. Her ideas led to a mushroom effect of asylums all over the United States in the mid-19th-century.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-prison-reform-movement>Who was involved in the prison reform movement?</h2>
<p>The champion of discipline and first national figure in prison reform was Louis Dwight. founder of the Boston Prison Discipline Society, he spread the Auburn system throughout America’s jails and added salvation and Sabbath School to further penitence.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-prison-asylum-reform-movement-in-the-1800s>Who was the leader of the prison asylum reform movement in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>Led by Dorothea Dix, the Massachusetts reform movement succeeded and quickly spread to other states. By the beginning of the Civil War most states had established public mental institutions, and the practice of keeping the mentally ill in jails and almshouses was in decline.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-prison-reform-start>Why did prison reform start?</h2>
<p>The goal of this system was to break the spirit of the prisoner and make them completely submissive. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the U.S. was experiencing labor shortages. Reformers and law makers believed that prisoners should work to support their incarceration.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-history-of-prison-reform>What is the history of prison reform?</h2>
<p>In the late 1700s and 1800s, a strong prison reform movement began to take shape. Instead of only punishing criminals, prisons were now expected to reform them. Originally constructed based on fear of incarceration, prison designs began to accommodate religious instruction, education and the health of the prisoners.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-prison-reform-movement-begin>How did the prison reform movement begin?</h2>
<h2 id=how-did-the-prison-reform-start>How did the prison reform start?</h2>
<p>In 1787, one of the first prison reform groups was created: Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons, known today as the Pennsylvania Prison Society. This group wanted to improve the conditions in the local jail.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-prison-reform-movement-start>How did the prison reform movement start?</h2>
<p>The call to improve prison conditions dates to 1699 in England, when the Christian Knowledge Society visited prisons, distributing religious books and money. In the late 1700s and 1800s, a strong prison reform movement began to take shape. Instead of only punishing criminals, prisons were now expected to reform them.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-prison-reformers-do-in-the-19th-century>What did prison reformers do in the 19th century?</h2>
<p>Prison reformers promoted the belief that prisons should be designed and run to reform prisoners which became the dominant attitude in the 19th century. It was believed that prisoners could be reformed through hard work, reflection and Christian teaching inside prisons. Increasingly prisons were viewed as places where people could be reformed. 1</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-condition-of-inmates-in-the-1800s>What was the condition of inmates in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>Mentally ill inmates were held in the general population with no treatments available to them. While the creation of mental asylums was brought about in the 1800s, they were far from a quick fix, and conditions for inmates in general did not improve for decades.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-prison-conditions-like-in-the-1950s>What was prison conditions like in the 1950’s?</h2>
<p>History Before the 1950s, prison conditions were grim. Inmates were regularly caged and chained, often in places like cellars and closets. They were also often left naked and physical abuse was common. Mentally ill inmates were held in the general population with no treatments available to them.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-riots-in-prison>What was the result of riots in prison?</h2>
<p>A series of riots and public outcry led to the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which were adopted in 1955, and conditions in prisons and for offenders improved.</p>
