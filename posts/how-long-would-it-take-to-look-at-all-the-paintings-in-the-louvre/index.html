<p>Everyone knows that the Louvre is home to a ton of art—but you’d be surprised at just how much. It would take you around 200 days to see each of the 35,000 works of art on display at the museum if you took 30 seconds to see each and every piece, according to Widjaja.</p>

<p>Re: How long it takes for Louvre? You can be in and out of the Louvre in about 40 minutes if you just want to see the greatest hits, and if you go through the Carrousel or another entrance other than the Pyramid. You can also spend days visiting the Louvre if you want.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-get-to-the-louvre-from-the-eiffel-tower>How to get to the Louvre from the Eiffel Tower?</h2>
<p>To get to The Louvre from the Eiffel Tower, you have four options: the Metro, the bus, the taxi, and a nice leisurely walk. Paris has an evolved Metro service, and almost every place has a metro station within 500 meters (1/3 of a mile).</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-eiffel-tower-located-in-paris>Where is the Eiffel Tower located in Paris?</h2>
<p>The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Montmartre is a large hill in Paris’s 18th arrondissement.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-times-have-we-seen-the-eiffel-tower>How many times have we seen the Eiffel Tower?</h2>
<p>Distance: approximately 6.5kms (4 miles). How many times have we seen the Eiffel Tower? Maybe a thousand times… still we’re always tempted to take tons of photos each time we see it! On Sunday morning, the Iron Lady was enhanced by the beautiful light of a February sun. View of the tower from avenue de Suffren (15th arrondissement):</p>

<p>It took us more than 8 km to find our way from the Bir-Hakeim métro station to the Glass Pyramid of the Louvre (and as you can guess I pushed Aimée in her stroller all the way!) Fetching directions…… Arrive at: métro station Palais Royal Musée du Louvre (lines 1 and 7), place du Palais Royal (1st arrondissement)</p>
