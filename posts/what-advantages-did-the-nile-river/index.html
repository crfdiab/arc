<h2 id=what-advantages-did-the-nile-river>What advantages did the Nile river?</h2>
<p>The most important thing the Nile provided to the Ancient Egyptians was fertile land. Most of Egypt is desert, but along the Nile River the soil is rich and good for growing crops. The three most important crops were wheat, flax, and papyrus.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-of-the-nile-delta>What are the advantages of the Nile Delta?</h2>
<p>The Nile Delta area known in antiquity was a vital element of the development of ancient Egyptian society and played an intrinsic part in their religion, culture and day-to-day sustenance. In addition to providing fertile farmland, the Delta offered the ancient Egyptians many other valuable resources.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-benefits-of-the-nile-river>What are some of the benefits of the Nile River?</h2>
<p>The Nile is a major source of irrigation and hydro-electricity in Ethiopia. The River has also been a major source of conflict between North and North-Eastern African countries. Egypt have been accused of dominating the resources of the river especially by constructing the mighty Aswan Dam.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-ancient-egyptians-live-near-the-nile-river>Why did the ancient Egyptians live near the Nile River?</h2>
<p>the ancient efypt people lived near the nile river because the waters was calm. ALSO AN0THER REASON IS THAT THE NILE RIVER SUPPLIED FRESH WATER. THE NILE WAS GREAT FOR SILT, FERTILE LAND; WHEN THE RIVER FLOODED.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-banks-of-the-nile-river-green>Why are the banks of the Nile River Green?</h2>
<p>The banks of the Nile all along its vast length contain rich soil as well, thanks to annual flooding that deposits silt. From space, the contrast between the Nile’s lush green river banks and the barren desert through which it flows is obvious. For millennia, much of Egypt’s food has been cultivated in the Nile delta region.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-farmers-do-when-the-nile-river-flooded>What did the farmers do when the Nile River flooded?</h2>
<p>The floods brought rich black soil onto the banks of the Nile River which made it possible for farmers to grow crops. The Nile was the ancient egyptians made route of transportation from place to place. The dry climate near the Nile made it so the ancient pyramids still stand today.</p>
