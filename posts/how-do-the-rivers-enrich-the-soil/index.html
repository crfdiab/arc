<h2 id=how-do-the-rivers-enrich-the-soil>How do the rivers enrich the soil?</h2>
<p>When a river overflows its banks, the nearby areas get flooded. During the flood, a thin layer of fine soil and silt gets deposited over the land, thereby forming rich alluvial soil which is highly fertile and nutrient-dense for the plants.</p>
<h2 id=which-two-rivers-are-important-for-farming-and-are-found-in-southwest-asia>Which two rivers are important for farming and are found in Southwest Asia?</h2>
<p>The Tigris and Euphrates join together in southern Iraq to create the Shatt al-Arab which empties into the Persian Gulf. Rivers in Southwest Asia provide water for both drinking and farming in a very dry region.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-leaching-of-soil>What is leaching of soil?</h2>
<p>Currently, leaching primarily describes the process of water carrying soluble substances or small particles through soil or rock. As the water passes through the rock and soil, it interacts with the surfaces of the materials. Compounds on the surface of minerals can be become dissolved.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-soil-is-flooded>What happens when the soil is flooded?</h2>
<p>Flooding can significantly alter the level of plant available nutrients in the soil. Soil lost due to erosion can take with it valuable plant-available nutrients and organic matter. Deposition of sediments from floods may increase the level of nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and potassium in the soil.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-leaching-give-example>What is leaching give example?</h2>
<p>In agriculture, leaching is the loss of water-soluble plant nutrients from the soil, due to rain and irrigation. Soil structure, crop planting, type and application rates of fertilizers, and other factors are taken into account to avoid excessive nutrient loss. Example:- Red and yellow soil is formed due to leaching.</p>
<h2 id=in-which-soil-leaching-is-most-common>In which soil leaching is most common?</h2>
<p>What soil type is most prone to leaching? The more porous the soil, the easier it is for chemicals to pass through. Pure sand is probably the best leaching type, but isn’t very hospitable to garden plants. In general, the more sand your garden soil has, the more likely it is that you will have excess leaching.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-rivers-important-to-life-in-south-asia>How are rivers important to life in South Asia?</h2>
<p>These rivers play a key role in supporting life in South Asia. Their waters provide crucial irrigation for agricultural lands. They also carry rich soil, called alluvial soil, on their journey down from the mountains. When the rivers overflow their banks, they deposit this soil on alluvial plains, lands that are rich farmlands.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-landforms-and-resources-of-south-asia>What are the landforms and resources of South Asia?</h2>
<p>South Asia: Landforms and Resources 1 Mountains and Plateaus. The Himalayas are part of South Asia, a region that includes seven countries—India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. 2 Rivers, Deltas, and Plains. 3 GREAT RIVERS. 4 FERTILE PLAINS. 5 Offshore Islands. …</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-ancient-people-of-mesopotamia-get-their-water>How did the ancient people of Mesopotamia get their water?</h2>
<p>Mesopotamia is a region that has two great rivers. They provided ancient people with water for drinking and for crops. When the rivers flooded, they deposited fresh soil on the land, making it good for farming. In addition, it was easy to move trade goods by boat down the rivers.

<h2 id=why-are-the-ganges-and-brahmaputra-important-to-south-asia>Why are the Ganges and Brahmaputra important to South Asia?</h2>
<p>The Ganges and Brahmaputra eventually meet to form one huge river delta before entering the Bay of Bengal. These rivers play a key role in supporting life in South Asia. Their waters provide crucial irrigation for agricultural lands. They also carry rich soil, called alluvial soil, on their journey down from the mountains.</p>
