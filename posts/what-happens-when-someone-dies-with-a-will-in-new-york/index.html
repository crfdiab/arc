<p>In New York State, the Surrogate’s Court decides what happens to a person’s property when that person dies. That person’s property is called the estate. When a person dies and leaves a Will then they died testate. If the person died without leaving a Will, then they died intestate.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-will-avoid-probate-in-new-york>Does a Will avoid probate in New York?</h2>
<p>In New York, you can make a living trust to avoid probate for virtually any asset you own—real estate, bank accounts, vehicles, and so on. You need to create a trust document (it’s similar to a will), naming someone to take over as trustee after your death (called a successor trustee).</p>

<p>Probate or letters of administration will be needed so the personal representative can pass it whoever will inherit the share of the property, according to the will or the rules of intestacy. The property might have a mortgage.</p>

<p>When a person dies intestate, that person’s property is distributed according to the law. In New York, that law is found in EPTL 4-1.1. Who gets what depends on who the living relatives are and their relationship to the Decedent, the person who died.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-there-is-no-will-in-new-york>What happens when there is no will in New York?</h2>
<p>In New York, that law is found in EPTL 4-1.1. Who gets what depends on who the living relatives are and their relationship to the Decedent, the person who died. The family members who are entitled to a share of the Decedent’s estate when there is no will are called “distributees”. If the Decedent has…</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-a-person-dies-without-a-will-and-testament>What happens when a person dies without a will and testament?</h2>
<p>When a person dies without leaving a Last Will and Testament, it’s said that they died intestate. When a person dies intestate, that person’s property is distributed according to the law.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-a-tenant-dies-without-a-will>What happens if a tenant dies without a will?</h2>
<p>The personal representative has the legal authority to convey the tenant’s share of the property to the named beneficiary. If the tenant died without a will, the court will appoint a personal representative, and that person will convey the tenant’s share to the next of kin.</p>
