<h2 id=how-many-layers-of-clothing-does-antarctica-have>How many layers of clothing does Antarctica have?</h2>
<p>Clothing can be divided into two layers: inner, insulating layers. outer, windproof or waterproof layer.</p>
<h2 id=what-coats-do-people-wear-in-antarctica>What coats do people wear in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Under Layers We recommend you don’t wear any cotton, but instead choose merino wool, silk or polypropylene inner layers, as they retain body heat far better. On top of one or two base layers, you can then add a jumper or fleece layer, before your outer weatherproof jacket.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-layers-should-you-wear-in-the-arctic>How many layers should you wear in the Arctic?</h2>
<p>Underneath that you will need three and in some instances four layers depending on the day – thermal underwear, thick long sleeve shirt, jumper or fibre pile jacket. Your legs are generally not so susceptible to the cold but on most days you would also need thermal long johns.</p>
<h2 id=what-socks-do-they-wear-in-the-arctic>What socks do they wear in the Arctic?</h2>
<p>Sturdy, tall wool (or other thick material) socks should be worn over a thin pair of silk, polypropylene or cotton/wool socks which provide enough insulation for your feet. Bring several pairs of outer socks, as your feet will inevitably get wet. Insoles for gumboots.</p>
<h2 id=what-clothing-do-you-need-in-the-arctic>What clothing do you need in the Arctic?</h2>
<p>The first layer next to your skin should be long-sleeved and long-leg thermal underwear and socks (100% wool – but this can itch – or similar synthetic quality clothing). The second layer should consist of a long-sleeved shirt or jumper and a pair of cotton or fleece leggings or trousers.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-wear-layers-in-antarctica>Do you have to wear layers in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>In Antarctica you have to wear multiple layers of clothes to keep warm. How many layers you wear will depend on the activity you are doing, if you are sitting still you will need more layers than if you are active. Points of interest for teachers:</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-gloves-do-you-wear-in-antarctica>What kind of gloves do you wear in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Put these on under your big gloves as a base layer so that when you take the outer layer off (to take photos, adjust your gear, etc), you will still have a thin layer to protect your hands from the wind and cold. When it comes to choosing the best gloves for Antarctica, good ski gloves still reign supreme.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-pack-for-a-trip-to-antarctica>What should I pack for a trip to Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Polar clothing, extreme cold weather gear & packing tips for Antarctica. 1 Underwear. Starting at the very beginning, the best underwear for Antarctica is sports underwear, including sports bras. Brands we recommend include 2 Base Layer. 3 Shirts. 4 Trousers. 5 Insulation Layer.</p>
