<h2 id=which-ocean-is-towards-the-east-of-australia>Which ocean is towards the east of Australia?</h2>
<p>The Coral Sea (French: Mer de Corail) is a marginal sea of the South Pacific off the northeast coast of Australia, and classified as an interim Australian bioregion….Download coordinates as: KML.</p>
<table><tr><th>Coral Sea</th></tr><tr><td>Coordinates</td><td>18°S 158°ECoordinates: 18°S 158°E</td></tr><tr><td>Type</td><td>Sea</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-ocean-of-the-east>What is the ocean of the East?</h2>
<p>Atlantic Ocean<br>
The Atlantic Ocean covers an area of approximately 41,105,000 square miles . As the second largest ocean basin, the Atlantic Ocean borders the east coast of the U.S., while the Pacific, Earth’s largest ocean basin, borders the U.S. West Coast.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-pacific-ocean-east-of-australia>Is the Pacific Ocean east of Australia?</h2>
<p>The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth’s oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-closest-ocean-or-sea-to-australia>What is the closest ocean or Sea to Australia?</h2>
<p>Pacific Ocean<br>
Australia is an island continent. This means that every state (excluding Northern Territory and the ACT) is surrounded by Ocean waters. To the South but not bordered on the Australian coast is the Southern Ocean, to the West is the Indian Ocean and to the East is the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-eastern-australian-current-real>Is the Eastern Australian current real?</h2>
<p>The East Australian Current is a real thing, and it runs south from the Great Barrier Reef down the East coast of Australia just like in the movie. At the southern end of the EAC, the current breaks up into numerous eddies, or vortices of terror as Marlin would say, each of which are as wide as the EAC itself.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-ocean-current-near-australia>Which is the largest ocean current near Australia?</h2>
<p>At around 15° S near the Australian coast the SEC divides forming the southward flow of the EAC. It is the largest ocean current close to the shores of Australia. The EAC reaches a maximum velocity at 30° S where its flow can reach 90 cm/s.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-eastern-states-of-australia-located>Where are the eastern states of Australia located?</h2>
<p>The term can sometimes be applied to the states in orange. The eastern states of Australia are the states adjoining the east coast of Australia. These are the mainland states of Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales; the Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay Territory, while not states, are also included.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-australia-located-in-relation-to-the-world>Where is Australia located in relation to the world?</h2>
<p>Australia is a continent and an island located in Oceania between the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean. It shares its name with the country that claims control over it. Properly called the Commonwealth of Australia, its territory consists of the entire continent and smaller outlying islands.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-east-australian-current-come-from>Where does the east Australian current come from?</h2>
<p>(Composite 15-day image showing the extension of the Leeuwin Current around Tasmania) The East Australian Current (EAC) is the southward western boundary current that is formed from the South Equatorial Current (SEC) crossing the Coral Sea and reaching the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
