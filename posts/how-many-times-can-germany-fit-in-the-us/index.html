<p>Quality of Life. Pros: Germany is a highly developed country that’s clean and orderly. Things run on time, there is a respect for the environment, and the country’s infrastructure is good.

<p>Either Alaska and Texas is bigger than Germany and if put those to States together they would cover all of Europe.

<p>Redditor jchill was quick to offer a solution to the problem, noting that “If you exclude Russia I’m willing to bet that the rest of Europe could fit into Alaska and the remaining open space in the contiguous US.” He later added that these countries would, indeed, fit into Alaska without even needing the open space in the lower 48.</p>

<p>Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia can all fit inside Alaska with room to spare. But as you might suspect, much of that landmass is virtually uninhabited.
