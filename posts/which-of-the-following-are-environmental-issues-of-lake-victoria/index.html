<h2 id=which-of-the-following-are-environmental-issues-of-lake-victoria>Which of the following are environmental issues of Lake Victoria?</h2>
<p>Over the last four decades, however, the lake has faced a number of environmental problems, including pollution, biodiversity loss, habitat destruction and soil erosion. It is estimated that the lake’s indigenous fish species have been reduced by 80% and over 70% of the forest cover in the catchment area has been lost.</p>
<h2 id=is-lake-victoria-pollution>Is Lake Victoria pollution?</h2>
<p>Lake Victoria in East Africa is in danger of “dying from the bottom,” as one Kenyan official puts it. The world’s second-largest freshwater lake is being polluted by everything from plastic and litter to chemical fertilizers.</p>
<h2 id=what-rivers-flow-into-lake-victoria>What rivers flow into Lake Victoria?</h2>
<p>A number of important rivers flow into Lake Victoria including the River Mara, Kagera, Yala, Nyando, Bukora and Katonga. The White Nile is the only river flowing out of the Lake (Lake Victoria Basin Commission 2007a).</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-rivers-and-lakes-in-africa>Why are there so many rivers and lakes in Africa?</h2>
<p>Out of all the rivers and lakes in Africa (Africa is home to 677 lakes btw), 80 are shared by more 1-2 or more countries. This often leads to political stress, where the parties interested keep conflicting over the ownership/usage of the resources. And this makes the states unable to keep the water clean or readily available to its citizens.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-affected-by-water-scarcity-in-africa>How many people are affected by water scarcity in Africa?</h2>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa is the home to hundreds of millions of people who suffer from water scarcity issues [2]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that more than 40 percent of the global water-stressed population lives in Sub-Saharan Africa [3].</p>
<h2 id=how-does-farming-contribute-to-the-water-problem-in-africa>How does farming contribute to the water problem in Africa?</h2>
<p>As you already know, farming is the backbone of the African economy. Surprisingly it also contributes to the water problem in the continent. How? You might wonder… The physical distraction of the farming soils and vegetation during ploughing, logging, overgrazing, roads construction, etc. result in soil erosion.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-children-dying-from-lack-of-water-in-africa>Why are children dying from lack of water in Africa?</h2>
<p>85% of the children below five years of age in African continent lose their loves due to lack of access to clean drinking water. They simply die due to contaminated waters and water-borne diseases.</p>
