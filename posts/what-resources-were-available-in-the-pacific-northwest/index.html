<h2 id=what-resources-were-available-in-the-pacific-northwest>What resources were available in the Pacific Northwest?</h2>
<p>The traditional Northwest Coast economy was a complex whole. One of its most important distinctions was the highly efficient use of natural resources. Aquatic resources were especially bountiful and included herring, oil-rich candlefish (eulachon), smelt, cod, halibut, mollusks, five species of salmon, and gray whales.</p>
<h2 id=what-natural-resource-was-plentiful-in-the-pacific-northwest>What natural resource was plentiful in the Pacific Northwest?</h2>
<p>The Pacific Northwest Coast at one time had the most densely populated areas of indigenous people. The mild climate and abundant natural resources, such as cedar and salmon, made possible the rise of a complex aboriginal culture.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-valuable-resource-for-the-ancient-pacific-northwest>What was the most valuable resource for the ancient Pacific Northwest?</h2>
<p>Pacific Salmon was abundant in the waters, and became the most important food resource of the people.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-economic-activity-in-pacific-northwest-in-the-early-1800s>What was the main economic activity in Pacific Northwest in the early 1800s?</h2>
<p>The area had been explored by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1804–06 and by various trappers and fur traders, and settlers began arriving there by way of the Oregon Trail in the 1840s. Farming and trapping were the original economic mainstays, to be followed in later years by lumbering, fishing, and mining.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-1-economic-activity-in-the-pacific-northwest>What is 1 economic activity in the Pacific Northwest?</h2>
<p>Mechanization—of transportation, resource extraction, and manufacturing—brought immense changes to the Pacific Northwest, then, and cemented the role of extractive industry as the dominant activity in the region.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-native-americans-survive-in-the-pacific-northwest>How did Native Americans survive in the Pacific Northwest?</h2>
<p>The ocean and the lush coastal forests provided the Northwest Coast people with everything that they needed to survive. Tribes carved huge canoes made from cedar or spruce trees. The boats could fit up to 30 people, who paddled into the sea to hunt otters, seals, and whales.</p>
<h2 id=what-resources-does-the-us-lack>What resources does the US lack?</h2>
<p>Oil and natural gas, like coal, are nonrenewable resources.</p>
<h2 id=what-natural-resource-does-the-united-states-have-that-canada-does-not>What natural resource does the United States have that Canada does not?</h2>
<p>The United States and Canada have a rich supply of mineral, energy, and forest resources. The U.S. has abundant supplies of coal, copper, lead, iron, natural gas, timber, bauxite, and uranium. 18% of the land in the U.S. is arable land.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-pacific-northwest-known-for>What is Pacific Northwest known for?</h2>
<p>The Pacific Northwest of the United States is best known for its beautiful coastline, green interior, rainy weather, and spectacular mountains.</p>
<h2 id=what-triggered-the-formation-of-the-pacific-northwest>What triggered the formation of the Pacific Northwest?</h2>
<p>It is a large batholith complex. Its formation is related to subduction of the Kula and Farallon tectonic plates along the continental margin during the Jurassic-to-Eocene periods.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-natural-resources-in-california>What are some of the natural resources in California?</h2>
<p>Natural resources in California include waterways such as the San Joaquin Delta, the Pacific Ocean coastline, natural parks, plants and wildlife, and numerous habitats and ecosystems. Natural resources in California provide many economic and aesthetic benefits.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-people-of-the-pacific-northwest-do-for-a-living>What did the people of the Pacific Northwest do for a living?</h2>
<p>Due to the prosperity made possible by the abundant natural resources in this region, the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest developed complex religious and social ceremonies as well as many fine arts and crafts. Music was created to honor the Earth, the creator, ancestors, and all other aspects of the supernatural world.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-culture-of-the-northwest-coast>What was the culture of the northwest coast?</h2>
<p>These nations had time and energy to devote to the establishment of fine arts and crafts and to religious and social ceremonies. The term “Northwest Coast”, or “North West Coast”, is used to refer to the groups of indigenous people residing along the coasts of British Columbia, Washington State, parts of Alaska, Oregon, and northern California.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-climate-like-in-the-pacific-northwest>What was the climate like in the Pacific Northwest?</h2>
