<h2 id=did-cabbage-come-from-europe>Did cabbage come from Europe?</h2>
<p>Cabbage was most likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, although savoys were not developed until the 16th century AD. By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become a prominent part of European cuisine. Cabbage is a good source of vitamin K, vitamin C and dietary fiber.</p>
<h2 id=what-vegetables-are-from-europe>What vegetables are from Europe?</h2>
<p>EU produced vegetables include: tomatoes, which in Europe are considered vegetables, peppers, eggplants, courgettes, cucumbers and gherkins, along with root, tuber and bulb vegetables such as carrots, radishes, onions, shallots and garlic and leafy stalked vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, chicory, endives.</p>
<h2 id=who-brought-cabbage-to-america>Who brought cabbage to America?</h2>
<p>Jacques Cartier<br>
Cabbage was introduced to America in 1541-42 by Jacques Cartier, who planted it in Canada on his third voyage. Because of its popularity among Europeans, it was doubtless planted in what is now the United States by some of the earliest colonists, although there is no written record of it until 1669.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-cabbage-grown-in-the-uk>Where is cabbage grown in the UK?</h2>
<p>Spring greens are a key variety of cabbage in Cornwall. They grow slowly in cold weather, but with warmer Cornish winters David is able to continue growing right through the winter. He plants them from March through to August and harvests them all-year-round.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-did-cabbage-originate-from>What country did cabbage originate from?</h2>
<p>Cabbage is one of the oldest vegetables known, and has been cultivated for over 4,000 years. It was originally found growing wild on the seashores of Southern Europe, England and Den- mark.</p>
<h2 id=is-cabbage-better-for-you-cooked-or-raw>Is cabbage better for you cooked or raw?</h2>
<p>Although you get different nutrients if you cook or ferment it, raw red cabbage in particular might give you the best nutritional boost per serving. Slice it very thinly and leave it for about 10 minutes to help bring out the fullest, most complex flavors. Then add it to salads or sandwiches or turn it into coleslaw.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-month-to-plant-cabbage>What is the best month to plant cabbage?</h2>
<p>Cabbage is a cool-weather crop. Grow cabbage in spring so that it comes to harvest before the summer heat or start cabbage in mid to late summer so that it comes to harvest during the cool days of autumn, winter, or early spring. Start seeds indoors 4 to 6 weeks before the last frost in spring.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-a-cabbage-head-to-form>How long does it take for a cabbage head to form?</h2>
<p>You can expect to see heads in approximately 71 days with green cabbage. Red cabbage takes slightly longer and Nappa cabbage will form small heads in only 57 days. Cabbage head formation sometimes occurs better in the moist, gently warming conditions of spring than in the cooling days of fall.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-cabbage-come-from-what-country>Where did the first Cabbage come from what country?</h2>
<p>The wild ancestor of the cabbage is known as Brassica oleracea and this if found natively throughout Europe and Britain. The first domestication of the cabbage probably occurred before 1000 BC in Europe, but the exact history may never be known. Cabbage spread throughout Europe and was well known by the Middle Ages.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-cabbage-eaten-in-the-middle-ages>Why was cabbage eaten in the Middle Ages?</h2>
<p>Cabbage was eaten and used for medicinal purposes in both ancient Greece and Rome. The Greeks believed that cabbage was harmful to grapevines and would spread its odor to the grapes. From that belief, they came to regard cabbage as an anecdote to drunkenness. Cabbage and kale were common vegetables in the Middle Ages.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-producer-of-headed-cabbage>Which is the largest producer of headed cabbage?</h2>
<p>Headed Cabbage, which is one of the most important economic crops, is now found in many parts of the world. Larger producer countries are China, India, Russia, Poland and Japan. Russia is the largest consuming country in the world. The table below shows the global Cabbage production for 2017.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-name-brassica-cabbage-come-from>Where does the name Brassica cabbage come from?</h2>
<p>At the present time, the humble contribution of the editorial team of ‘Kalliergeia’ to the issue, is that the name Brassica probably comes from the Ancient Greek word ‘βράσσω’. The word βράσσω’ (or ‘ βράττω’ in the Attic dialect) means ‘ ζέω’.</p>
