<h2 id=why-is-the-angle-of-the-sun-important>Why is the angle of the sun important?</h2>
<p>The amount of the Sun’s energy falling at any point on the Earth depends on the angle of the Sun. This is reason why the seasons have different temperatures, and the polar regions are colder, on average than regions around the equator.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-angle-of-the-sun-mean>What does the angle of the sun mean?</h2>
<p>angle of incidence<br>
Sun angle is the angle of incidence at which sunlight strikes the Earth at a particular time and place. In most places the Sun rises in the morning, is highest at noon, and sets in the evening. The angle controls the amount of heat energy received at this place, so summer days are usually warmer than winter nights.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-angle-of-the-sun-an-important-factor-in-insulation>Why is the angle of the sun an important factor in insulation?</h2>
<p>The intensity of solar radiation is largely a function of the angle of incidence, the angle at which the Sun’s rays strike the Earth’s surface. If the Sun is positioned directly overhead or 90° from the horizon, the incoming insolation strikes the surface of the Earth at right angles and is most intense.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-angle-of-sunlight-affect-the-amount-of-energy-that-is-absorbed>How does the angle of sunlight affect the amount of energy that is absorbed?</h2>
<p>Sunlight that strikes the Earth directly heats the surface more than sunlight that strikes at an angle. The steeper the angle, the less solar radiation can be absorbed. Over millions of years, changes in the location of land and oceans can alter how much light is absorbed or reflected by the surface of the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-angle-of-the-sun-affect-climate>How does the angle of the sun affect climate?</h2>
<p>The angle of incoming solar radiation influences seasonal temperatures of locations at different latitudes. At higher latitudes, the angle of solar radiation is smaller, causing energy to be spread over a larger area of the surface and cooler temperatures.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-current-angle-of-the-sun>What is the current angle of the sun?</h2>
<p>The current Right Ascension of The Sun is 09h 19m 03s and the Declination is +15° 38′ 23” (topocentric coordinates computed for the selected location: Greenwich, United Kingdom [change]).</p>
<h2 id=at-what-angle-of-insolation-is-strongest>At what angle of insolation is strongest?</h2>
<h2 id=how-does-the-angle-of-insolation-affect-temperature>How does the angle of insolation affect temperature?</h2>
<p>The angle of incoming solar radiation influences seasonal temperatures of locations at different latitudes. Therefore, the solar radiation is concentrated over a smaller surface area, causing warmer temperatures.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-angle-of-the-sun-so-important>Why is the angle of the sun so important?</h2>
<p>Although the length of the day is an important factor in explaining why summers are hot and winter cold, the angle of sunlight is probably more important. In the arctic summer, even though the sun shines 24 hours a day, it produces only moderate warmth, because it skims around the horizon and its light arrives at a low angle.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-angle-of-sunlight-affect-a-solar-panel>How does the angle of sunlight affect a solar panel?</h2>
<p>As the angle of the sunlight on a solar panel deviates from the perpendicular, the solar-panel power output decreases. This is because the average intensity of the light incident on a flat surface area decreases as the angle decreases from 90 degrees.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-sun-hit-the-earth-at-a-steep-angle>Why does the sun hit the Earth at a steep angle?</h2>
<p>The same also holds for the Earth. The rays of the summer sun, high in the sky, arrive at a steep angle and heat the land much more than those of the winter sun, which hit at a shallow angle. Although the length of the day is an important factor in explaining why summers are hot and winter cold, the angle of sunlight is probably more important.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-angle-of-the-suns-rays-affect-water>How does the angle of the sun’s rays affect water?</h2>
<p>The collector is then exposed to the highest concentration of sunlight: as shown here, if the sun is 45 degrees above the horizon, a collector 0.7 meters wide perpendicular to its rays intercepts about as much sunlight as a 1-meter collector flat on the ground. It therefore heats its water faster and reaches a higher temperature.</p>
