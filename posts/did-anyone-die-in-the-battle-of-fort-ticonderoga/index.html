<p>Burgoyne’s army occupied Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, the extensive fortifications on the Vermont side of the lake, without opposition on 6 July. Advance units pursued the retreating Americans….</p>

<h2 id=was-george-washington-at-fort-ticonderoga>Was George Washington at Fort Ticonderoga?</h2>
<p>General Washington finally visited Fort Ticonderoga in July 1783 while awaiting the official cessation of hostilities with Great Britain. We shall set out by water on 18 July. It would be his only visit to Ticonderoga, though it was a place frequently on his mind in the early years of the Revolution from 1775 to 1777.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-battle-of-fort-ticonderoga-end>How did the Battle of Fort Ticonderoga end?</h2>
<p>How it ended. American victory. Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys, together with Benedict Arnold, surprised and overtook a small British garrison at the fort, acquiring valuable weapons for the Continental Army. Arnold took command of Ticonderoga until he was relieved in June 1775.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-fort-ticonderoga>Who was the leader of Fort Ticonderoga?</h2>
<p>The Hudson River is a major river running to the Atlantic Ocean. By July 8th, 1758, the fort was defended by a group of Frenchman under the command of Louis-Joseph le Marquis de Montcalm, who had served the British King during the Seven Years War. When British soldiers came to attack, the French easily defeated them.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-lived-in-fort-ticonderoga-in-1775>How many people lived in Fort Ticonderoga in 1775?</h2>
<p>In 1775 it was garrisoned by only a small detachment of the 26th Regiment of Foot, consisting of two officers and forty-six men, with many of them “invalids” (soldiers with limited duties because of disability or illness). Twenty-five women and children lived there as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-john-allen-do-at-fort-ticonderoga>What did John Allen do at Fort Ticonderoga?</h2>
<p>When the British commander asks under whose authority he is acting, Allen allegedly replies, “In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress,” and demands the British surrender the fort. Nobody is killed in the attack. Allen’s men plunder the premises for liquor and other provisions and celebrate their victory by getting drunk.</p>
