<h2 id=where-is-the-state-of-north-dakota-located>Where is the state of North Dakota located?</h2>
<p>Location map of North Dakota in the US. North Dakota is a landlocked state in the Great Plains of north central US, south of Canada. The state borders South Dakota in south, Montana in the west, and the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba in north.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-border-between-minnesota-and-north-dakota>How long is the border between Minnesota and North Dakota?</h2>
<p>North Dakota’s eastern border is 434 miles long. Minnesota attained statehood in 1858 with its western border being defined by the Red River from the border with Canada to the Bois de Sioux River and extends to Lake Traverse.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-minnesota-farther-north-than-any-other-state>Why is Minnesota farther north than any other state?</h2>
<p>Minnesota’s Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods is farther north than any other part of the contiguous United States. Logically, it would seem that this area of about 123 square miles should be in Canada. But this oddest feature of the entire U.S.–Canada boundary was the proper result of American treaties negotiated with Great Britain.</p>
