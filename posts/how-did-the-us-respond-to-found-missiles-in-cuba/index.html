<h2 id=how-did-the-us-respond-to-found-missiles-in-cuba>How did the US respond to found missiles in Cuba?</h2>
<p>After many long and difficult meetings, Kennedy decided to place a naval blockade, or a ring of ships, around Cuba. The aim of this “quarantine,” as he called it, was to prevent the Soviets from bringing in more military supplies. He demanded the removal of the missiles already there and the destruction of the sites.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-us-agree-to-do-to-end-the-cuban-missile-crisis>What did the US agree to do to end the Cuban Missile Crisis?</h2>
<p>Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev orders withdrawal of missiles from Cuba, ending the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy announced a naval blockade to prevent the arrival of more missiles and demanded that the Soviets dismantle and remove the weapons already in Cuba. …</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-us-use-to-blockade-cuba>What did the US use to blockade Cuba?</h2>
<p>John F. Kennedy decided to place a naval “quarantine,” or blockade, on Cuba to prevent further Soviet shipments of missiles. Kennedy announced the quarantine on October 22 and warned that U.S. forces would seize “offensive weapons and associated matériel” that Soviet vessels might attempt to deliver to Cuba.</p>
<h2 id=what-options-did-the-united-states-have-to-counter-the-soviet-build-up-of-missiles-in-cuba>What options did the United States have to counter the Soviet build up of missiles in Cuba?</h2>
<p>What options did the U.S have to counter the Soviet build-up of missiles in Cuba? Blockade, Go to war by the land and sea. Diplomacy. What were some of the unforeseen situations that have started a nuclear war in 1962?</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-united-states-not-want-missiles-in-cuba>Why did the United States not want missiles in Cuba?</h2>
<p>From the outset of the crisis, Kennedy and ExComm determined that the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba was unacceptable. The challenge facing them was to orchestrate their removal without initiating a wider conflict–and possibly a nuclear war.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-us-scared-of-the-missiles-in-cuba>Why was the US scared of the missiles in Cuba?</h2>
<p>Missile Gap- Khrushchev was worried that the USA had more long range missiles than the USSR. The USA even had missiles in Europe and Turkey. By putting medium range missiles in Cuba (virtually America’s backyard) it would begin to even the gap between them.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-3-options-that-were-suggested-to-deal-with-the-missiles-in-cuba>What were the 3 options that were suggested to deal with the missiles in Cuba?</h2>
<p>Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara presents JFK with three options: diplomacy with Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, a naval quarantine of Cuba, and an air attack to destroy the missile sites, which might kill thousands of Soviet personnel and trigger a Soviet counterattack on a target …</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-us-start-sending-missiles-to-cuba>When did the US start sending missiles to Cuba?</h2>
<p>Castro increasingly sought aid from the Soviet Union. In October 1962, the Soviets began shipping nuclear-capable missiles to Cuba. American U-2 spy planes caught the shipments on film, touching off the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-us-send-the-cuban-five-back-to-cuba>Why did the US send the Cuban Five back to Cuba?</h2>
<p>The U.S. alleged they had entered Florida and infiltrated Cuban-American human rights groups. The U.S. also charged that information the so-called Cuban Five sent back to Cuba helped Castro’s air force destroy two Brothers-to-the-Rescue planes returning from a covert mission to Cuba, killing four passengers.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-cuban-missile-crisis>What was the outcome of the Cuban Missile Crisis?</h2>
<p>For thirteen days in October 1962 the world waited—seemingly on the brink of nuclear war—and hoped for a peaceful resolution to the Cuban Missile Crisis. In October 1962, an American U-2 spy plane secretly photographed nuclear missile sites being built by the Soviet Union on the island of Cuba.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-cia-find-the-soviet-submarine>When did the CIA find the Soviet submarine?</h2>
<p>The CIA has a favorite phrase: “We can neither confirm nor deny.”. It was born as part of a strange Cold War drama, involving Howard Hughes, that now has a new twist. Back in March 1968, a Soviet submarine and its nuclear missiles suffered a catastrophic accident and sank to the dark, chilly floor of the Pacific.</p>
