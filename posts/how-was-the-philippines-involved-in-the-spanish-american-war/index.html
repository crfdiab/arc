<h2 id=how-was-the-philippines-involved-in-the-spanish-american-war>How was the Philippines involved in the Spanish-American War?</h2>
<p>After its defeat in the Spanish-American War of 1898, Spain ceded its longstanding colony of the Philippines to the United States in the Treaty of Paris. The ensuing Philippine-American War lasted three years and resulted in the death of over 4,200 American and over 20,000 Filipino combatants.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-filipino-rebel-in-the-spanish-american-war>Who was the Filipino rebel in the Spanish-American War?</h2>
<p>During the Spanish-American War, Filipino rebels led by Emilio Aguinaldo proclaim the independence of the Philippines after 300 years of Spanish rule.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-filipino-rebels-get-involved-in-the-spanish-american-war-brainly>How did Filipino rebels get involved in the Spanish-American War Brainly?</h2>
<p>They destroyed the Spanish fleet stationed in the Philippines. They produced supplies for the Spanish army. They supported the United States, hoping for independence.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-become-involved-in-the-filipino-rebellion-against-spain>How did the US become involved in the Filipino rebellion against Spain?</h2>
<p>The causes of the conflict were many, but the immediate ones were America’s support of Cuba’s ongoing struggle against Spanish rule and the mysterious explosion of the U.S.S. The Spanish fleet guarding the Philippines was defeated by the U.S. Navy under the command of Commodore George Dewey on May 1, 1898.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-philippines-get-involved-in-the-spanish-american-war>How did the Philippines get involved in the Spanish-American War?</h2>
<p>The United States entered overseas war against the Spanish in the American-Spanish war which lasted from 1898 to 1902 and eventually turned into the American-Filipino war. Before the arrival of the Americans, Philippines had been annexed and become a colony of Spain.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-philippine-american-war>Who was the leader of the Philippine American War?</h2>
<p>Antonio Luna, the ablest commander among the Filipinos, was given charge of their military operations but seems to have been greatly hampered by the jealousy and distrust of Aguinaldo, which he fully returned. Luna was murdered, and on March 31, 1899, the rebel capital of Malolos was captured by U.S. forces.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-us-gain-control-of-the-philippines>When did the US gain control of the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Although an unconnected insurgency campaign by Moro bands on Mindanao continued sporadically until 1913, the United States had gained undisputed control of the Philippines and retained possession of the islands until 1946. The human cost of the war was significant.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-americans-died-in-the-philippine-american-war>How many Americans died in the Philippine American War?</h2>
<p>An estimated 20,000 Filipino combatants were killed, and more than 200,000 civilians perished as a result of combat, hunger, or disease. Of the 4,300 Americans lost, some 1,500 were killed in action, while nearly twice that number succumbed to disease. This article was most recently revised and updated by Michael Ray, Editor.</p>
