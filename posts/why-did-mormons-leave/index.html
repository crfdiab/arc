<h2 id=why-did-mormons-leave>Why did Mormons leave?</h2>
<p>I left Mormonism for many reasons, but the most significant issue I had was the way it made me feel. I grew up believing that my goal in life was to marry and be ‘sealed’ for eternity in the temple. This idea of marriage being vital was ingrained in me when I was eleven, attending my first youth activity.</p>

<p>Joseph Smith Murdered In February 1844, Smith and his brother were jailed on charges of treason. On June 27, 1844, both Smith and his brother were murdered in jail by an anti-Mormon mob in Carthage, Illinois.</p>
<h2 id=who-founded-the-mormon-faith-in-new-york>Who founded the Mormon faith in New York?</h2>
<p>Mormonism is the religious tradition and theology of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity started by Joseph Smith in Western New York in the 1820s and 30s.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-i-leave-the-mormon-church-as-a-child>Why did I leave the Mormon Church as a child?</h2>
<p>When I was little, we left the church because my mom read up about the history of polygamy, so I have very little memories that are specific to the church from that time period. I spent most of my life outside of the church, and grateful to not be in it.</p>

<p>On June 27, 1844, both Smith and his brother were murdered in jail by an anti-Mormon mob in Carthage, Illinois. After Smith died, the church divided. Many Mormons followed Brigham Young, who became Smith’s successor. Young led a large group of persecuted Mormons from Illinois to search for religious freedom.</p>

<p>To earn extra money, the family hired themselves out as day laborers and occasionally ran a food stand in town. In the years 1816 and 1817, a religious revival swept through upper state New York, so much so that the region was termed the “burned-over district.”</p>
