<h2 id=what-is-the-state-south-of-oklahoma>What is the state south of Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>Oklahoma<br>
South Central Oklahoma/State</p>
<h2 id=how-did-oklahoma-get-its-boundaries>How did Oklahoma get its boundaries?</h2>
<p>The history of the Oklahoma Panhandle has its roots to the Compromise of 1850 and in 1845 when Texas became a state. Therefore the northern boundary of the Texas Panhandle only stretched that far north, even though as a republic Texas claimed a strip of land stretching northward into modern Wyoming.</p>
<h2 id=is-oklahoma-more-southern-or-midwestern>Is Oklahoma more Southern or Midwestern?</h2>
<p>Oklahoma is definitely more Southern than Midwestern.</p>
<h2 id=do-people-consider-oklahoma-the-south>Do people consider Oklahoma the South?</h2>
<p>THE SOUTH. According to the Census Bureau, the South consists of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma. Washington, DC, is also included in the South.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-states-that-border-the-state-of-oklahoma>What are the states that border the state of Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>Oklahoma borders Colorado in the northwest, Kansas in the north, Missouri in the northeast, Arkansas in the east, and Texas in the south. It also shares a border with New Mexico at the western end of its panhandle.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-map-of-oklahoma-without-county-boundaries>Is there a map of Oklahoma without county boundaries?</h2>
<p>The map above is a Landsat satellite image of Oklahoma with County boundaries superimposed. We have a more detailed satellite image of Oklahoma without County boundaries. Copyright information: The maps on this page were composed by Brad Cole of Geology.com.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-rivers-in-the-state-of-oklahoma>What are the main rivers in the state of Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>The Black Mesa is part of a large range of mesas in the panhandle which extends into New Mexico. Rivers. Main rivers are the Arkansas River with its tributaries, the Canadian and the Cimarron Rivers. The Red River, a major tributary of the Mississippi, forms a section of Oklahoma’s southern border with Texas.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-a-boundary-dispute-between-texas-and-oklahoma>Why was there a boundary dispute between Texas and Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>The bed of the Red River expanded and contracted through the natural processes of erosion and accretion. Mineral rights aside (there was an abundance of law to sift through to decide who controlled those) the question pertaining to the boundary dispute was “where is the south bank?”</p>
