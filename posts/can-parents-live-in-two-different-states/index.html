<h2 id=can-parents-live-in-two-different-states>Can parents live in two different states?</h2>
<p>Parents can live in different states and share legal custody if the parents have a cordial relationship and communicate, although it can be difficult for the parent who does not live in the same state as the child to participate in medical appointments, for example.</p>
<h2 id=which-states-favor-mothers-custody>Which states favor mothers custody?</h2>
<p>The Best States for Shared Parenting</p>
<ul>
<li>Kentucky: A.</li>
<li>Arizona: A-</li>
<li>District of Columbia: B+</li>
<li>Iowa and Nevada: B.</li>
<li>6-9. Louisiana, Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin (‘B-‘)</li>

</ul>
<h2 id=how-do-i-co-parent-if-i-live-in-another-state>How do I co parent if I live in another state?</h2>
<p>One of the most important things you can do when your kids live in another state is to maintain regular, consistent communication with them. Say you plan to talk with your kids on the phone or by FaceTime or Skype three times a week. Don’t wait for a convenient time to come along; schedule those calls in advance.</p>
<h2 id=what-determines-a-childs-home-state>What determines a child’s home state?</h2>
<p>When deciding a child’s “home state,” the Court must determine the state in which a child has lived with a parent, or a person acting as a parent, for at least six consecutive months immediately preceding the commencement of a child custody proceeding, discounting any temporary absences.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-apart-can-parents-live-and-still-have-5050-custody-in-california>How far apart can parents live and still have 50/50 custody in California?</h2>
<p>Rule of thumb is parents need to live within 20 miles of each other. Generally in cases involving parents that live more than 20 miles apart there’s usually a primary physical custodial parent because more than 20 miles just becomes too difficult to have the children going between two homes 50 percent of the time.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-can-a-parent-move-with-joint-custody-in-california>How far can a parent move with joint custody in California?</h2>
<p>Generally, you can move with the children so long as the relocation doesn’t interfere with your current custody arrangement. For courts, that’s usually limited to a distance of 50 miles or less. (However, even a move 30 miles away could be disruptive depending on the circumstances.)</p>
<h2 id=do-family-courts-favour-mothers>Do family courts Favour mothers?</h2>
<p>Does the Family Court favour mothers when determining with which parent dependent children lives? The law itself does not provide for any bias in favour of the mother but this sadly does not mean that bias does not occur.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-mother-unfit-in-the-eyes-of-the-court>What makes a mother unfit in the eyes of the court?</h2>
<p>Factors that can lead a court to deem a parent unfit include: Instances of abuse or neglect; Willing failure to provide the child with basic necessities or needs; Abandonment of the child or children; or.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-have-the-right-to-know-who-my-child-is-around>Do I have the right to know who my child is around?</h2>
<p>Each parent is entitled to know where the children are during visitations. They should also know if the children are left with other people such as babysitters or friends when the other parent is not there. Parents should tell each other their current addresses and home and work phone numbers.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-a-single-mom-move-to-another-state>How can a single mom move to another state?</h2>
<p>8 Tips for Relocating as a Single Parent</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by planning your move well in advance.</li>
<li>Constantly communicate with your children and prepare them for the move.</li>
<li>Involve the children in your planned move.</li>
<li>Being a single parent means that you have lots of obligations and things to think about.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-do-you-prove-best-interest-of-the-child>How do you prove best interest of the child?</h2>
<p>You can demonstrate this by showing that you have enrolled your child in school, are involved in their education and upbringing, have participated in extracurricular activities, and have made other parenting decisions demonstrating an interest in nurturing your child.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-child-choose-which-parent-to-live-with>Can a child choose which parent to live with?</h2>
<p>Can My Child Choose Which Parent to Live With? On a fairly regular basis I am asked by a divorced parent how old their child must be before they can choose which parent they want to live with. Many parents tell me their child will be 12 years old, 13 years old, 14 years old soon and will be able to make their own decisions.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-mother-and-child-stay-in-the-same-room>Can a mother and child stay in the same room?</h2>
<p>Will they be allowed to stay together in the hospital, the same ward or the same room, is the question often posed. According to Dr P Shravan Kumar, Superintendent of Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad and the Telangana Coordinator for measures to tackle COVID-19, “The mother and child, even if one of them is positive, can be in the same room.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-mother-get-sole-custody-of-a-child>Can a mother get sole custody of a child?</h2>
<p>There once was a time when the mothers automatically received sole custody simply because they were the mother, but those days are over. Approximately 50% of the custody cases today end with the father getting sole custody, so do not assume anything.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-mother-get-custody-of-her-child-after-a-divorce>Can a mother get custody of her child after a divorce?</h2>
<p>In a 2016 case, the Supreme Court was bent towards giving a mother custody of her minor (aged below 18 years) but the child wanted to live with her father, after the couple was mutually divorced.</p>
