<p>climax<br>
In some environments, succession reaches a climax, which produces a stable community dominated by a small number of prominent species. This state of equilibrium, called the climax community, is thought to result when the web of biotic interactions becomes so intricate that no other species can be admitted.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-final-ecological-stage>What is the final ecological stage?</h2>
<p>Climax<br>
Climax – the climax stage is the last stage of an ecosystem. It is when the ecosystem has become balanced and there is little risk of an interfering event or change to mutate the environment. Several rainforests and deserts qualify as being in the climax stage.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-humans-affect-ecological-succession>How do humans affect ecological succession?</h2>
<p>So how does human activity cause secondary succession to take place? Well, humans cause a lot of destruction to the natural world, through deforestation, starting forest fires, farming, and building things. So when we destroy the environment, we allow a new environment where secondary succession begins to take place.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-intermediate-stage-of-ecological-succession>Which is the intermediate stage of ecological succession?</h2>
<p>As seral community is an intermediate stage found in ecological succession in an ecosystem advancing towards its climax community. The first plant to colonise an area is called the pioneer community. The final stage of succession is called the climax community. A climax community is stable, mature, more complex and long-lasting.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-description-of-the-process-of-succession>Which is the best description of the process of succession?</h2>
<p>Succession is the process by which new community gets established at an area which had been uninhabited. The community which gets established at the site is called climax community. It is the aggregation of changes of species structure in an ecological community over time.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-an-ecosystem-go-back-to-its-secondary-stage>When does an ecosystem go back to its secondary stage?</h2>
<p>Human-made ecological disasters are events which can destroy an established ecosystem (primary, secondary or in the climax stage) and force it to go backward. Depending on the force of impact, the ecosystem can go back to the secondary stage (usually fires and floods). But it could even all the way back to the primary stage.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-invasive-species-affect-the-succession-process>How does invasive species affect the succession process?</h2>
<p>Invasive species are non native organisms which can spread widely in a community. These are usually threatening the normal ecosystem and causative agents for community disturbance. However, in succession process, they help to alter the soil texture and function.</p>
