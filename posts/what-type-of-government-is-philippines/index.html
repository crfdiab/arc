Philippines/Government<br>
The Philippines is a republic with a presidential form of government wherein power is equally divided among its three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The government seeks to act in the best interests of its citizens through this system of check and balance.</p>
<h2 id=how-efficient-is-the-philippine-government>How efficient is the Philippine government?</h2>
<p>Philippines: Government effectiveness index (-2.5 weak; 2.5 strong) The average value for the Philippines during that period was -0.02 points with a minimum of -0.31 points in 1996 and a maximum of 0.19 points in 2014. The latest value from 2019 is 0.05 points.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-executive-power-in-the-philippines>What is executive power in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Executive power is exercised by the government under the leadership of the president. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two-chamber congress—the Senate (the upper chamber) and the House of Representatives (the lower chamber).</p>
<h2 id=is-philippines-a-developing-country-as-of-2020>Is Philippines a developing country as of 2020?</h2>
<p>It is less developed than countries classified as developed countries but these nations are ranked higher than least developed countries….Developing Countries 2021.</p>
<table><tr><th>Country</th><th>Human Development Index</th><th>2021 Population</th></tr><tr><td>Moldova</td><td>0.711</td><td>4,024,019</td></tr><tr><td>Philippines</td><td>0.712</td><td>111,046,913</td></tr><tr><td>Tonga</td><td>0.717</td><td>106,760</td></tr><tr><td>Maldives</td><td>0.719</td><td>543,617</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-executive-power-of-government>What is executive power of government?</h2>
<p>The executive is the branch of government that is responsible for the day-to-day management of the state. Under the doctrine of the separation of powers, the executive is not supposed to make laws (role of the legislature), nor to interpret them (role of the judiciary).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-government-does-the-philippines-have>What kind of government does the Philippines have?</h2>
<p>The Judicial Branch Of The Government Of Philippines. The Supreme Court of Philippines together with other inferior courts has the judicial power given by the Constitution. The Supreme Court is comprised of a Chief Justice who is head of the branch and 14 other Associate Justices who occupy the highest seats of the judicature.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-head-of-state-in-the-philippines>Who is the head of State in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>The Philippines is a unitary state with the President as both the head of state and the head of government. The government of the Philippines is made up of three interdependent branches which are the legislative, the executive, and the judicial system.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-still-one-president-in-the-philippines>Is there still one president in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Although the Philippines still has one president, through Federalism, the power of the national government is channeled to its governing regions, which then could be equated to ‘the few’. An addition to this claim is Plato’s Doctrine of the Mean.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-legislative-power-delegated-in-the-philippines>How is legislative power delegated in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>2. Delegation to the Congress. Fundamentally, legislative power is an attribute of sovereignty, in that the Constitution itself, the fundamental law of the State, is a legislation of the sovereign people. However, through the Constitution, the people “delegated” the legislative power to the Congress of the Philippines.</p>
