<h2 id=what-river-along-the-eastern-mediterranean-coast-has-no-outlet-to-the-sea-and-flows-south-into-the-dead-sea>What river along the eastern Mediterranean coast has no outlet to the sea and flows south into the Dead Sea?</h2>
<p>Which river along the Eastern Mediterranean coast has no outlet on the sea but flows south into the Dead Sea? The Jordan River.</p>
<h2 id=what-mountain-chains-frame-the-northern-and-southern-border-of-the-anatolian-peninsula>What mountain chains frame the northern and southern border of the Anatolian peninsula?</h2>
<p>The Zagros, Elburz, and Taurus mountains at the north side of the plate cut off part of the region from the south. Another important landform in the region is the Anatolian Peninsula, which is occupied by the country of Turkey. It marks the beginning of the Asian continent.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-waterways-separate-the-black-sea-from-the-mediterranean-sea>What two waterways separate the Black Sea from the Mediterranean sea?</h2>
<p>The Black Sea ultimately drains into the Mediterranean Sea, via the Turkish Straits and the Aegean Sea. The Bosporus Strait connects it to the small Sea of Marmara which in turn is connected to the Aegean Sea via the Strait of the Dardanelles.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-cities-central-to-the-religion-of-islam-are-located-in-this-country>What two cities central to the religion of Islam are located in this country?</h2>
<p>Prophet’s Mosque, Medina, Saudi Arabia. The current government of Saudi Arabia (i.e., the Saʿūd family) has largely relied on religion—including its close and continuing ties to Wahhābism and its status as the custodian of Mecca and Medina, the two holy cities of Islam—to establish its political legitimacy.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-jordan-river-flow-into-the-dead-sea>Where does the Jordan River flow into the Dead Sea?</h2>
<p>The man said: This water flows eastward to the Jordan River valley and empties into the Dead Sea, where it turns the salt water into fresh water. And he said to me: These waters that issue forth toward the hillocks of sand to the east, and go down to the plains of the desert, shall go into the sea, and shall go out, and the waters shall be healed.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-rivers-that-discharge-into-the-mediterranean-sea>What are the rivers that discharge into the Mediterranean Sea?</h2>
<p>These rivers account for half of the mean annual discharge, with the Rhone and the Po alone accounting for already one-third of it (Ludwig et al. 2009). Of the three continents that discharge into the Mediterranean Sea, Europe dominates, with a climatological mean annual discharge that accounts for half of the total.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-salt-water-go-in-the-dead-sea>Where does the salt water go in the Dead Sea?</h2>
<p>The man said: This water flows eastward to the Jordan River valley and empties into the Dead Sea, where it turns the salt water into fresh water. He said to me, “This water flows through the land to the east and down into the Jordan Valley and to the Dead Sea.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-sea-of-foul-water-go>Where does the Sea of foul water go?</h2>
<p>When it enters the sea, the sea of foul water, the water of the sea becomes fresh. The man said: This water flows eastward to the Jordan River valley and empties into the Dead Sea, where it turns the salt water into fresh water. He said to me, “This water flows through the land to the east and down into the Jordan Valley and to the Dead Sea.</p>
