<h2 id=what-is-the-problem-with-cutting-down-trees>What is the problem with cutting down trees?</h2>
<p>The loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a host of problems for indigenous people.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-cut-down-too-many-trees>What happens if you cut down too many trees?</h2>
<p>Trees also keep the ground wet and cool, and help to drive the water cycle. A large tree can push 150 tonnes of water into the atmosphere each year, which then falls back on the forest as rain. With no trees, the land will heat up and dry out and the dead wood will inevitably result in enormous wildfires.</p>
<h2 id=why-should-we-stop-cutting-down-so-many-trees>Why should we stop cutting down so many trees?</h2>
<p>Deforestation: Stop cutting down trees that are essential for the planet’s survival. Trees produce oxygen, clean soil, control noise pollution and drastically reduces erosion. Also, deforestation also destroys much needed habitat for animals, plants and other species.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-the-problem-of-deforestation>What causes the problem of deforestation?</h2>
<p>Direct causes of deforestation are agricultural expansion, wood extraction (e.g., logging or wood harvest for domestic fuel or charcoal), and infrastructure expansion such as road building and urbanization. Most often, multiple processes work simultaneously or sequentially to cause deforestation.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-we-cut-down-too-many-trees>What happens if we cut down too many trees?</h2>
<p>Cutting down too many trees will result in nature being gone very soon. We will not be able to survive because we live on the oxygen that trees and plants breathe out. Because we need O2 and give off CO2, and because trees and plants breathe CO2 and give off O2, if one group is not there then the other will die.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-people-cutting-down-trees-in-africa>Why are people cutting down trees in Africa?</h2>
<p>Still others don’t even seem to care This essay will discuss the causes and effects of cutting trees in African forests</p>
<h2 id=how-much-of-the-worlds-trees-have-been-cut-down>How much of the world’s trees have been cut down?</h2>
<p>According to some estimates, more than 50 percent of the tree cover has disappeared due to human activity. Although humans have been practicing deforestation since ages Deforestation is the clearance of forests by cutting trees or burning .The truth about Deforestation has been shown.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-farmers-cut-down-trees-to-graze>Why do farmers cut down trees to graze?</h2>
<p>When the land no longer has enough grass the graze, farmers are often driven to cut down more trees to make room for more grazing.</p>
