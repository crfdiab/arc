<h2 id=what-was-the-economy-like-in-plymouth-1620>What was the economy like in Plymouth 1620?</h2>
<p>The economy of Plymouth Colony was based on agriculture, fishing, whaling, timber and fur. The Plymouth Company investors initially invested about £1200 to £1600 in the colony before the Mayflower even sailed.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-economy-of-plymouth>What is the economy of Plymouth?</h2>
<p>Though Plymouth would never develop as robust an economy as later settlements—such as Massachusetts Bay Colony—agriculture, fishing and trading made the colony self-sufficient within five years after it was founded. Many other European settlers followed in the Pilgrims’ footsteps to New England.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-motivation-to-settle-at-plymouth-in-1620>What was the main motivation to settle at Plymouth in 1620?</h2>
<p>Plymouth Colony, America’s first permanent Puritan settlement, was established by English Separatist Puritans in December 1620. The Pilgrims left England to seek religious freedom, or simply to find a better life.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-economy-of-the-plymouth-colony>What was the economy of the Plymouth Colony?</h2>
<p>Writing to England in January 1687/88, he estimated Plymouth had exported two hundred tons of whale oil in the previous months, and predicted that whale oil would replace the fur trade as a staple of the colony’s economy. Another comes from Wait-Still Winthrop.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-plymouth-colony-absorbed-by-massachusetts>When was the Plymouth Colony absorbed by Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>Plymouth’s influence in New England declined accordingly, until it was absorbed by Massachusetts in 1691. Today, the original colony of Plymouth is a living museum, a recreation of the original seventeenth-century village.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-settlers-arrive-in-plymouth>When did the first settlers arrive in Plymouth?</h2>
<p>The Anne reached New Plymouth in July 1623 and the Little James, a week or two later. These ships were the first to arrive with settlers for Plymouth to join the 85 settlers from 1620 and 1621, plus Phineas Pratt and possibly two or three others from Weston’s abandoned settlement at Weymouth,…</p>
<h2 id=why-did-so-many-people-die-in-the-plymouth-colony>Why did so many people die in the Plymouth Colony?</h2>
<p>More than half the settlers fell ill and died that first winter, victims of an epidemic of disease that swept the new colony. Soon after they moved ashore, the Pilgrims were introduced to a Native American man named Tisquantum, or Squanto, who would become a member of the colony.</p>
