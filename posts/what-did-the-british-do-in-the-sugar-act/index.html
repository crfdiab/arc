<h2 id=what-did-the-british-do-in-the-sugar-act>What did the British do in the Sugar Act?</h2>
<p>Sugar Act, also called Plantation Act or Revenue Act, (1764), in U.S. colonial history, British legislation aimed at ending the smuggling trade in sugar and molasses from the French and Dutch West Indies and at providing increased revenues to fund enlarged British Empire responsibilities following the French and Indian …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-law-of-the-sugar-act>What was the law of the Sugar Act?</h2>
<p>Sugar Act. Parliament, desiring revenue from its North American colonies, passed the first law specifically aimed at raising colonial money for the Crown. The act increased duties on non-British goods shipped to the colonies.</p>
<h2 id=what-law-did-the-british-pass-after-the-sugar-act>What law did the British pass after the Sugar Act?</h2>
<p>the Revenue Act 1766<br>
The Sugar Act 1764 was repealed in 1766 and replaced with the Revenue Act 1766, which reduced the tax to one penny per gallon on molasses imports, British or foreign.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-sugar-act>What was the purpose of the Sugar Act?</h2>
<p>The Sugar Act of 1764 was a law enacted by Britain to increase British revenues by preventing the smuggling of molasses into the American colonies and enforcing the collection of higher taxes and duties.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-sugar-act-of-1764-repealed>When was the Sugar Act of 1764 repealed?</h2>
<p>The Sugar Act 1764 was repealed in 1766 and replaced with the Revenue Act 1766, which reduced the tax to one penny per gallon on molasses imports, British or foreign. This occurred around the same time that the Stamp Act 1765 was repealed.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-british-minister-during-the-sugar-act>Who was the British minister during the Sugar Act?</h2>
<p>In February 1763, as the war ended, the ministry headed by John Stuart, the Earl of Bute, decided to maintain a standing army of ten thousand British regular troops in the colonies. Shortly thereafter, George Grenville replaced Bute. Grenville supported his predecessor’s policy, even more so after the outbreak of Pontiac’s War in May 1763.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-sugar-act-benefit-new-england-distillers>How did the Sugar Act benefit New England Distillers?</h2>
<p>The act thus granted a virtual monopoly of the American market to British West Indies sugarcane planters. Early colonial protests at these duties were ended when the tax was lowered two years later. The protected price of British sugar actually benefited New England distillers, though they did not appreciate it.</p>
