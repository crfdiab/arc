<p>The Wastewater Treatment Process</p>
<ol>
<li>Stage One — Bar Screening.</li>
<li>Stage Two — Screening.</li>
<li>Stage Three — Primary Clarifier.</li>
<li>Stage Four — Aeration.</li>
<li>Stage Five — Secondary Clarifier.</li>
<li>Stage Six — Chlorination (Disinfection)</li>
<li>Stage Seven — Water Analysis & Testing.</li>
<li>Stage Eight — Effluent Disposal.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-steps-involved-in-treating-wastewater>What are the 3 steps involved in treating wastewater?</h2>
<p>There are three main stages of the wastewater treatment process, aptly known as primary, secondary and tertiary water treatment. In some applications, more advanced treatment is required, known as quaternary water treatment.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-4-stages-required-in-the-treatment-of-wastewater>What are the 4 stages required in the treatment of wastewater?</h2>
<p>4-Step Wastewater Sludge Treatment Process</p>
<ul>
<li>What is in sewage sludge?</li>
<li>Step 1 – Sludge Thickening.</li>
<li>Step 2 – Sludge Digestion.</li>
<li>Step 3 – Dewatering.</li>
<li>Step 4 – Disposal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-the-first-step-in-wastewater-treatment>What is the first step in wastewater treatment?</h2>
<p>Treatment Steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Step 1: Screening and Pumping.</li>
<li>Step 2: Grit Removal.</li>
<li>Step 3: Primary Settling.</li>
<li>Step 4: Aeration / Activated Sludge.</li>
<li>Step 5: Secondary Settling.</li>
<li>Step 8: Oxygen Uptake.</li>
<li>Sludge Treatment.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-many-steps-are-in-a-sewage-treatment-plant>How many steps are in a sewage treatment plant?</h2>
<p>three<br>
Sewage treatment generally involves three main stages, called primary, secondary and tertiary treatment but may also include intermediate stages and final polishing processes.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-reasons-for-water-treatment>What are two reasons for water treatment?</h2>
<p>The top three reasons water treatment is essential to your health include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce health risks. Chlorine added to drinking water fights bacteria.</li>
<li>Purification of sources. Water resources including lakes and rivers supplying drinking water contain garbage and pollution making it unfit for consumption.</li>
<li>Better taste.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-use-of-stp-plant>What is use of STP plant?</h2>
<p>STP plant treats the sewage to make it fit for safe disposal, agricultural use or domestic use in toilets etc. Sewage usually contains a high quantity of organic and inorganic wastes. It is essential to treat sewage before it enters into any water body.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-steps-in-waste-water-treatment>What are the steps in waste water treatment?</h2>
<p>Steps Involved in Waste Water Treatment. The objective of municipal and industrial waste water treatment is to extract pollutants, remove toxicants, neutralise coarse particles, kill pathogens so that quality of discharged water is improved to reach the permissible level of water to be discharged into water bodies or for agricultural land.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-process-of-treating-raw-sewage>What is the process of treating raw sewage?</h2>
<p>Wastewater, also known as raw sewage include but is not limited to water from the bathroom, toilets kitchen and other industrial wastes. Wastewater treatment is a process of removing micro-organisms, contaminants and any other pollutants from the wastewater.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-objective-of-waste-water-treatment>What is the objective of waste water treatment?</h2>
<p>The objective of municipal and industrial waste water treatment is to extract pollutants, remove toxicants, neutralise coarse particles, kill pathogens so that quality of discharged water is improved to reach the permissible level of water to be discharged into water bodies or for agricultural land.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-in-the-tertiary-stage-of-wastewater-treatment>What happens in the tertiary stage of wastewater treatment?</h2>
<p>Tertiary water treatment is the final stage of the multi-stage wastewater cleaning process. This third stage of treatment removes inorganic compounds, bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Removing these harmful substances makes the treated water safe to reuse, recycle, or release into the environment.</p>
