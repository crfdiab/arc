<h2 id=when-could-people-vote-in-ireland>When could people vote in Ireland?</h2>
<p>In 1972, the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution reduced the voting age to 18. In 1985, British citizens gained the right to vote in Dáil elections, reciprocating Irish citizens’ right to vote in the UK’s elections under the Ireland Act 1949.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-females-get-the-right-to-vote-in-ireland>When did females get the right to vote in Ireland?</h2>
<p>From 1918, with the rest of the United Kingdom, women in Ireland could vote at age 30 with property qualifications or in university constituencies, while men could vote at age 21 with no qualification. From separation in 1922, the Irish Free State gave equal voting rights to men and women.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-people-can-vote>What type of people can vote?</h2>
<p>You can vote in U.S. elections if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are a U.S. citizen.</li>
<li>Meet your state’s residency requirements. You can be homeless (PDF, Download Adobe Reader) and still meet these requirements.</li>
<li>Are 18 years old on or before Election Day.</li>
<li>Are registered to vote by your state’s voter registration deadline.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-no-presidential-candidate-wins-the-majority-of-the-electoral-votes>What happens if no presidential candidate wins the majority of the electoral votes?</h2>
<p>If no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, the House of Representatives elects the President from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes. The Senate elects the Vice President from the two vice presidential candidates with the most electoral votes. Each senator casts one vote.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-requirements-to-become-an-irish-citizen>What are the requirements to become an Irish Citizen?</h2>
<p>There are a few basic requirements to complete the citizenship application and process. Be 18 or over or married to an Irish citizen (children’s applications are completed by a parent or guardian) Be of good character. If you don’t quite meet these requirements, don’t be discouraged.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-citizen-of-ireland-be-added-to-the-register-of-electors>Can a citizen of Ireland be added to the Register of electors?</h2>
<p>If you are an Irish citizen living abroad, you cannot be added to the Register of Electors unless you are an Irish official on duty abroad (or their spouse or civil partner).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-benefits-of-being-an-irish-citizen>What are the benefits of being an Irish Citizen?</h2>
<p>Another benefit to Irish citizenship is the ability to vote in Irish elections. And, not only can you vote in elections, but you can run in an election for a position in the Irish government. To Sum Things Up: The Irish government allows foreign nationals to become Irish citizens in several ways.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-republic-of-ireland-become-a-democracy>When did the Republic of Ireland become a democracy?</h2>
<p>Democracy in independent Ireland Notwithstanding the Civil War of 1922-23, the Free State did emerge as parliamentary democracy. In 1923, the vote was extended to all women over 21 and the remaining property qualifications were also abolished. In 1973, after a referendum the vote was extended in the Republic to all adults over the age of 18.</p>
