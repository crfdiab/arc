<h2 id=what-was-alaska-first-settlers>What was Alaska first settlers?</h2>
<p>On Kodiak Island, Grigory Shelikhov, a Russian fur trader, founds Three Saints Bay, the first permanent Russian settlement in Alaska. The European discovery of Alaska came in 1741, when a Russian expedition led by Danish navigator Vitus Bering sighted the Alaskan mainland.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-people-of-alaska-live>How do people of Alaska live?</h2>
<p>Most people (two-thirds of all Alaskans) in live in communities found along the 484-mile stretch of highway and railway between Seward on the Kenai Peninsula and Fairbanks. This area is commonly called the Railbelt. Alaska’s biggest city, Anchorage, is home to 279,243 people (U.S. Census Bureau estimate 2008).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-us-occupy-alaska>How did U.S. occupy Alaska?</h2>
<p>On October 18, 1867, the U.S. formally takes possession of Alaska after purchasing the territory from Russia for $7.2 million, or less than two cents an acre. Negotiations between Seward (1801-1872) and the Russian minister to the U.S., Eduard de Stoeckl, began in March 1867.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-come-to-live-in-alaska>How did people come to live in Alaska?</h2>
<p>In the early to mid-18th century, fur trappers and traders from Russia began settling along the Alaskan peninsula and the Aleutian Islands. At first peaceful, these early Eurasian settlers soon found themselves at odds with the native peoples over resources.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-russian-settlers-settle-in-alaska>Where did the Russian settlers settle in Alaska?</h2>
<p>Russians settle Alaska. Russian hunters were soon making incursions into Alaska, and the native Aleut population suffered greatly after being exposed to foreign diseases. The Three Saints Bay colony was founded on Kodiak Island in 1784, and Shelikhov lived there for two years with his wife and 200 men.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-settlers-of-north-america-come-from>Where did the first settlers of North America come from?</h2>
<p>The first settlement of the Americas began when Paleolithic hunter-gatherers first entered North America from the North Asian Mammoth steppe via the Beringia land bridge, which had formed between northeastern Siberia and western Alaska due to the lowering of sea level during the Last Glacial Maximum.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-alaska-in-1890>What was the population of Alaska in 1890?</h2>
<p>Between 1890 and 1900, the population of Alaska nearly doubled, to about 63,000 people. Most of the people who came north planned to strike it rich and leave.. Some people did stay however. In 1910, the census report count was 64,356 people in Alaska. Forty years later the population almost doubled to 128,643 people.</p>
