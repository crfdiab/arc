<h2 id=what-are-the-three-ways-of-measuring-earthquake>What are the three ways of measuring earthquake?</h2>
<p>How do scientists measure earthquakes?</p>
<ul>
<li>Richter scale. Magnitude is a measure of the amount of energy released during an earthquake, and you’ve probably heard news reports about earthquake magnitudes measured using the Richter scale.</li>
<li>Mercalli scale.</li>
<li>Moment Magnitude Scale.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-are-earthquakes-monitored-in-new-zealand>How are earthquakes monitored in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Sensitive monitoring devices called seismometers are used to measure the magnitude and location of earthquakes. The New Zealand Seismometer Network is made up of over 50 main stations spread throughout the country. Sensing equipment is used alongside computer programmes which can record and analyse data.</p>
<h2 id=can-earthquakes-be-monitored>Can earthquakes be monitored?</h2>
<p>Earthquake activity can be monitored using seismographs; historical data can be used to identify fault zones and other likely sources of future events, and to assess earthquake hazards.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-christchurch-last-earthquake>When was Christchurch last earthquake?</h2>
<p>4 September 2010<br>
Christchurch’s central city and eastern suburbs were badly affected, with damage to buildings and infrastructure already weakened by the magnitude 7.1 Canterbury earthquake of 4 September 2010 and its aftershocks…</p>
<h2 id=which-is-true-to-p-waves-and-s-waves>Which is true to P waves and S waves?</h2>
<p>Because of their wave movement, P waves travel through any kind of material, whether it is a solid, liquid or gas. On the other hand, S waves only move through solids and are stopped by liquids and gases.</p>
<h2 id=what-warning-signs-are-monitored-by-seismologists>What warning signs are monitored by seismologists?</h2>
<p>Two vital signs related to seismic monitoring are earthquake activity and deformation and active tectonics. Earthquake activity can be monitored using seismographs; historical data can be used to identify fault zones and other likely sources of future events, and to assess earthquake hazards.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-to-monitor-for-earthquakes>Why do we need to monitor for earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Why do we monitor earthquakes? To provide warning of any future seismic activity so that appropriate steps can be taken to reduce the risk to lives and property. Seismograph monitoring at Craters of the Moon near the Wairakei Geothermal area. How do we monitor earthquakes? What are seismic waves? What are Seismographs?</p>
<h2 id=how-is-earthquake-monitoring-done-in-new-zealand>How is earthquake monitoring done in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Earthquake monitoring in New Zealand is undertaken by GNS Science’s GeoNet Project which provides a broad-based, around-the-clock monitoring system and a modern data management centre. Why do we monitor earthquakes? To provide warning of any future seismic activity so that appropriate steps can be taken to reduce the risk to lives and property.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-seismographs-used-to-track-an-earthquake>How are seismographs used to track an earthquake?</h2>
<p>The seismometer is connected to a seismograph, which records the motion of the mass during an earthquake as a series of squiggly lines called a seismogram. Seismograph stations all over the world can record the seismic waves from the same earthquake.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-different-types-of-earthquakes-measured>How are the different types of earthquakes measured?</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to measure different aspects of an earthquake: 1 Magnitude is the most common measure of an earthquake’s size. It is a measure of the size of the earthquake source and… 2 Intensity is a measure of the shaking and damage caused by the earthquake; this value changes from location to location. More …</p>
