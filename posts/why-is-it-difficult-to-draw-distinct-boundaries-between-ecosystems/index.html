<h2 id=why-is-it-difficult-to-draw-distinct-boundaries-between-ecosystems>Why is it difficult to draw distinct boundaries between ecosystems?</h2>
<p>The boundaries on an ecosystem are hard to define because of the biotic factors in the ecosystem and those surrounding it make it hard to define the boundaries.</p>
<h2 id=do-ecosystems-have-distinct-boundaries>Do ecosystems have distinct boundaries?</h2>
<p>Ecosystems rarely have distinct boundaries and are not self-contained. -Formed when one ecosystem merges with the next in a transition zone (when increased, called and edge effect.) The existence, abundance, and distribution of species is determined by physical and chemical conditions that species can tolerate.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-ecosystem-have-no-distinct-boundaries>Which of the ecosystem have no distinct boundaries?</h2>
<p>Biomes have no distinct boundaries. Instead, there is a transition zone called an ecotone, which contains a variety of plants and animals. For example, an ecotone might be a transition region between a grassland and a desert, with species from both.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-boundaries-of-ecosystem>What are the boundaries of ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Ecosystem boundaries are the locations exhibiting gradients of change in environmental conditions and a related shift in the composition of plant and/or animal communities. Naturally occurring ecosystem boundaries can represent unique habitats to which many species are specifically adapted.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-examples-of-diverse-ecosystem>What are examples of diverse ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Some examples of ecosystems that are rich in diversity are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deserts.</li>
<li>Forests.</li>
<li>Large marine ecosystems.</li>
<li>Marine ecosystems.</li>
<li>Old-growth forests.</li>
<li>Rainforests.</li>
<li>Tundra.</li>
<li>Coral reefs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-2-ecosystems-would-have-a-very-defined-boundary>What 2 ecosystems would have a very defined boundary?</h2>
<p>Aquatic ecosystems tend to have well defined boundaries as well. Terrestrial ecosystems have more subjective boundaries.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-classify-boundaries>How do you classify boundaries?</h2>
<p>More generally, we could classify boundaries as having exogenous or endogenous origins, arising, respectively, from processes outside or inside the system of patches and boundaries being studied.</p>
<h2 id=can-ecosystem-boundaries-be-any-size>Can ecosystem boundaries be any size?</h2>
<p>Ecosystems can occur in a wide range of sizes. The biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem provide the boundaries that distinguish one ecosystem from another. Changes in any one ecosystem can ultimately have far-reaching effects on the global environment.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-boundaries-of-an-ecosystem-formed>How are the boundaries of an ecosystem formed?</h2>
<p>The boundaries that we can draw around an ecosystem aren’t solid walls, but instead allow materials to pass across them. For example, in the ecosystem of your mouth, food, oxygen, and water come in from outside the ecosystem, and these materials also leave the mouth ecosystem when you swallow or exhale.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-move-in-and-out-of-an-ecosystem>What can move in and out of an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Nutrients, organisms, water, air, and any of the other parts of ecosystems can move in and out of ecosystems. The boundaries that we can draw around an ecosystem aren’t solid walls, but instead allow materials to pass across them.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-so-hard-to-set-boundaries>Why is it so hard to set boundaries?</h2>
<p>On a healthy day, this can help you learn and engage in dynamic ways. Operating in the extreme can lead to constant chaos and little time to be more selective and intentional in your activities and how they relate to your long-term goals. You’d rather eat the stress than let someone else down.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-shifting-boundary>Which is an example of a shifting boundary?</h2>
<p>You may have observed another example of shifting boundaries in your city or town. The boundary of a growing town or city edges further and further outward. Next time you observe the boundary of an ecosystem, try to figure out whether the boundary can move, and if so, does it move at a creeping pace, or in giant leaps?</p>
