<h2 id=why-did-american-settlers-in-texas-rebel-against-mexico-in-the-1830s>Why did American settlers in Texas rebel against Mexico in the 1830s?</h2>
<p>The revolution began in October 1835, after a decade of political and cultural clashes between the Mexican government and the increasingly large population of American settlers in Texas. Determined to avenge Mexico’s honor, Santa Anna vowed to personally retake Texas.</p>
<h2 id=what-action-did-the-mexican-government-take-in-texas-in-1830>What action did the Mexican government take in Texas in 1830?</h2>
<p>On April 6, 1830, Mexican president Anastasio Bustamante ordered Texas to comply with the emancipation proclamation or face military intervention. To circumvent the law, many Anglo colonists converted their slaves into indentured servants for life.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-conflict-between-american-settlers-in-texas-and-the-mexican-government>What caused conflict between American settlers in Texas and the Mexican government?</h2>
<p>Settlers went into conflict with the Mexican government because they were planters who brought slaves. Mexico had abolished slavery before and refused this practice. Texas later became independent shortly and joined the USA in 1845.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-a-major-conflict-between-american-settlers-in-texas-and-the-mexican-government-before-texas-gained-its-independence-in-1836>What was a major conflict between American settlers in Texas and the Mexican government before Texas gained its independence in 1836?</h2>
<p>Texas Revolution, also called War of Texas Independence, war fought from October 1835 to April 1836 between Mexico and Texas colonists that resulted in Texas’s independence from Mexico and the founding of the Republic of Texas (1836–45).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-texans-not-like-the-mexican-government>Why did the Texans not like the Mexican government?</h2>
<p>In 1830, Mexico closed the border between Texas and the United States. The Mexican government was concerned too many Americans were coming to Texas. This made the Americans unhappy. The Mexicans also said no new slavery would be allowed.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-majority-in-texas-in-1830>Who was the majority in Texas in 1830?</h2>
<p>Mexico imposed two conditions on land ownership: settlers had to become Mexican citizens, and they had to convert to Roman Catholicism. By 1830 there were 16,000 Americans in Texas. At that time, Americans formed a 4-to-1 majority in the northern section of Coahuila y Tejas, but people of Hispanic heritage formed a majority in the state as a whole.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-mexico-fear-about-the-texas-revolution>What did Mexico fear about the Texas Revolution?</h2>
<p>Mexico feared that the United States planned to use the Texas colonists to acquire the province by revolution. Differences in language and culture had produced bitter enmity between the colonists and native Mexicans.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-immigration-from-the-united-states-to-mexico-banned>Why was immigration from the United States to Mexico banned?</h2>
<p>Immigration from the United States was banned in 1830 under the First Mexican Republic, in an attempt to stop large numbers of white Americans from setting up cotton plantations using slave labor (which had recently been banned in Mexico).</p>
<h2 id=why-was-mexico-flooded-by-immigrants-in-the-1800s>Why was Mexico flooded by immigrants in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>By the mid-1800s, Mexico had lost almost half its territory, a result of the Texas insurrection and the war with the United States, an invasion objected to on moral grounds by Americans such as Abraham Lincoln and Henry David Thoreau. This complex settler/colonist/immigrant dynamic continues to this day.</p>
