<h2 id=why-was-the-extended-family-important-to-west-african-village-life>Why was the extended family important to West African village life?</h2>
<p>In extended families, nuclear families (husband, wife, and children) or in some cases polygynous families (husband, wives, and children) acted as economic units. Elders in the extended family had great power over the economic and social lives of its members.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-family-important-in-west-africa>Why was family important in West Africa?</h2>
<p>During slavery, the family remained a principal base for social affiliation, economic activity, and political organization. Family traditions in Western Africa served as the model for family life during the period of slavery.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-extended-families-so-important-in-ancient-african-societies>Why were extended families so important in ancient African societies?</h2>
<p>Family is very important throughout Africa. Families, not individuals, are the building blocks of African society. Family members act as both an economic and emotional network and provide individuals with a sense of who they are and where they belong.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-extended-families-important>Why are extended families important?</h2>
<p>Extended family members, especially grandparents, can assist in passing on cultural teachings and traditions, including language. For example, grandparents can share stories, skills and teachings during their time with the grandchildren. This is also connected to the children’s healthy self-esteem.</p>
<h2 id=which-family-member-plays-the-authority-figure-in-africa>Which family member plays the authority figure in Africa?</h2>
<p>In most cultures within South Africa the mother is the main authoritative figure when it comes to household decisions. In South Africa, meals may be eaten all together as a family, or separately depending on family members’ schedules.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-kinship-in-west-african-cultures>What is the role of kinship in West African cultures?</h2>
<p>Kinship is the web of relationships woven by family and marriage. Traditional relations of kinship have affected the lives of African people and ethnic groups by determining what land they could farm, whom they could marry, and their status in their communities.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-different-family-roles-in-african-societies>What were the different family roles in African societies?</h2>
<p>Family plays a central role in African society. It shapes such daily experiences as how and where individuals live, how they interact with the people around them, and even, in some cases, whom they marry. It can determine a person’s political identity and the way money and property are transferred.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-nature-of-an-extended-family-in-african-society>What is the nature of an extended family in African society?</h2>
<p>The extended family system in Africa emphasises on the principle of ‘living together’ and the sense of ‘community of brothers and sisters’. Thus, the African notion of family includes the whole lineage of the couple and their in-laws.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-extended-family>What causes extended family?</h2>
<p>Economic background has become a very prominent factor in the likelihood of living in an extended family. Many families who live in low-income areas are beginning to move in with one another for financial and emotional support.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-relationship-of-members-of-extended-family>What are the relationship of members of extended family?</h2>
<p>Extended families consist of several generations of people and can include biological parents and their children as well as in-laws, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-family-in-africa>What is the importance of family in Africa?</h2>
<p>The concept of family is one of universal precedence amongst all Africans, whether they belong to the west, east, central or southern regions. Family is a vital aspect of African livelihood. It is what unifies us.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-dynamics-of-an-african-family>What are the dynamics of an African family?</h2>
<p>You can appreciate the African understanding of family as it is rather important as well as beneficial to be able to develop a lasting bond and relationship with your cousins, aunts and uncles, but when it comes to dealing with household issues, I can’t help but find myself gravitating towards the Euro-Canadian concept of family life.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-the-family-in-western-society>What is the role of the family in Western society?</h2>
<p>The Western notions of isolating the family dynamic to solely include the main actors, ie. mother, father and children helps build a stronger bond amongst the immediate family. The overall role of the family is to give a good model so that others within the society can imitate resulting in the betterment of the society.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-families-did-african-people-have>What kind of families did African people have?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, Africans coexisted within small communities, which were made up of families divided into different ethnic or cultural groups, or in some cases, into clans causing a complex yet interconnected network of relationships.</p>
