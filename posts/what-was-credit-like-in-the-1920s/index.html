<h2 id=what-was-credit-like-in-the-1920s>What was credit like in the 1920s?</h2>
<p>The expansion of credit in the 1920s allowed for the sale of more consumer goods and put automobiles within reach of average Americans. Now individuals who could not afford to purchase a car at full price could pay for that car over time — with interest, of course!</p>
<h2 id=what-role-did-credit-play-in-the-1920s-economy>What role did credit play in the 1920’s economy?</h2>
<p>What role did credit play in the American economy in the 1920’s? 1920s credit helped businesses and corporations boost their profits and sales. When the stock market crashed, the excessive credit that was issued forced the consumers into poverty. As a result, businesses failed.</p>
<h2 id=what-2-things-led-to-an-economic-boom-in-1920s>What 2 things led to an economic boom in 1920’s?</h2>
<p>The main reasons for America’s economic boom in the 1920s were technological progress which led to the mass production of goods, the electrification of America, new mass marketing techniques, the availability of cheap credit and increased employment which, in turn, created a huge amount of consumers.</p>
<h2 id=what-three-things-led-to-the-economic-boom-in-the-1920s>What three things led to the economic boom in the 1920s?</h2>
<h2 id=what-did-families-look-like-in-the-1920s>What did families look like in the 1920s?</h2>
<p>U.S. Census Bureau statistics, presented in a report on Historical Statistics from the Colonial Era to the 1970s, say a lot about what American families looked like throughout history. In the 1920s marriage was still a goal and priority for most, but smaller household sizes began to take shape as men and women sought to have fewer children.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-credit-go-down-in-the-1920s>Why did credit go down in the 1920s?</h2>
<p>The other possibility is that borrowers pay down the balance of the loan. This means that a lot of cash is used to make the payment, which means that the cash cannot be used to spend on other things, whether consumption or investment. People short of cash might want to liquidate assets, possibly driving down asset prices.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-the-1920s-in-europe>What was life like in the 1920s in Europe?</h2>
<p>Following the end of the First World War, the 1920s rolled around like a smoke infused breath of fresh air. Millions of young men had lost their lives and Europe was still cleaning up four long and bloody years of war. Women were emancipated in part with the vote and no one had ever been so optimistic about the future.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-1920s-known-as-the-roaring-twenties>Why was the 1920s known as the Roaring Twenties?</h2>
<p>The 1920s, also known as the ‘Roaring Twenties’, was a decade of contrasts. The First World War had ended in victory, peace had returned and with it, prosperity. For some the war had proved to be very profitable.</p>
