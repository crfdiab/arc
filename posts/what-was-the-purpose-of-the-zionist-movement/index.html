<p>What is the Zionist Movement? Zionism was a movement in the late 1800s which directed on the organization of a Jewish homeland in the territory interpreted as the ancient Land of Israel.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-hovevei-zion-movement>What was the purpose of the Hovevei Zion movement?</h2>
<p>History of Zionism. The Hovevei Zion, or the Lovers of Zion, were responsible for the creation of 20 new Jewish settlements in Palestine between 1870 and 1897. Before the Holocaust, the movement’s central aims were the creation of a Jewish national home and cultural centre in Palestine by facilitating Jewish migration.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-zionist-congress-take-place>Where did the First Zionist Congress take place?</h2>
<p>In 1897 Herzl convened the first Zionist Congress at Basel, Switzerland, which drew up the Basel program of the movement, stating that “Zionism strives to create for the Jewish people a home in Palestine secured by public law.”. Get unlimited access to all of Britannica’s trusted content.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-lovers-of-zion-move-to-palestine>Why did the lovers of Zion Move to Palestine?</h2>
<p>A decade before Theodor Herzl founded the modern Zionist movement, upwards of 3,000 members of the Russian-based Lovers of Zion organization moved to Palestine, joining about 30,000 Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews who had gone there for religious, economic and personal reasons.</p>

<p>The Zionist movement was fueled by two things: the religious beliefs of the Jewish people regarding a return to their ancient homeland and the waves of anti-Semitism which swept the Jewish world in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-current-state-of-zionism-in-the-world>What is the current state of Zionism in the world?</h2>
<p>The Current State of Zionism. Sources: Zionism is a religious and political effort that brought thousands of Jews from around the world back to their ancient homeland in the Middle East and reestablished Israel as the central location for Jewish identity. While some critics call Zionism an aggressive and discriminatory ideology.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-president-of-the-world-zionist-organization>Who was the first president of the World Zionist Organization?</h2>
<p>After the Dreyfus Affair, Herzl wrote Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State), a pamphlet that called for political recognition of a Jewish homeland in the area then known as Palestine. In 1897, Herzl organized the First Zionist Congress, which met in Basel, Switzerland. He also formed and became the first president of the World Zionist Organization.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-jewish-people-get-the-land>How did the Jewish people get the land?</h2>
<p>The Jewish people’s connection to the land goes back some 4,000 years when, according to the Bible, God bequeathed it to the Jewish people through an unconditional covenant with Abraham. The Bible also records the Israelites’ settlement of the land and the establishment of the Davidic Kingdom there.</p>
