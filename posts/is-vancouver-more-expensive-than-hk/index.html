<h2 id=why-is-vancouver-called-hongcouver>Why is Vancouver called hongcouver?</h2>
<p>Hongcouver – name with xenophobic connotations, it came into use in the 1980s and 1990s. Although Vancouver has had a large Chinese community from its earliest days, the Chinese population surged as large numbers of Hong Kong citizens immigrated prior to the British handover of that city in 1997.</p>
<h2 id=does-canada-recognize-hong-kong>Does Canada recognize Hong Kong?</h2>

<h2 id=is-the-city-of-vancouver-similar-to-hong-kong>Is the city of Vancouver similar to Hong Kong?</h2>
<p>The City of Vancouver is also known as “Hongcouver” to some people due to its significant Chinese population as well as its cultural and economic similarities to Hong Kong, but is it really? We’ve all heard it before, “Vancouver is turning (has turned) into an Asian city.” More specifically, Hong Kong.</p>

<h2 id=whats-the-cost-of-living-in-hong-kong-and-vancouver>What’s the cost of living in Hong Kong and Vancouver?</h2>
<p>You would need around 36,439.25HK$ (6,749.35C$) in Vancouver to maintain the same standard of life that you can have with 49,000.00 HK$ in Hong Kong (assuming you rent in both cities). This calculation uses our Cost of Living Plus Rent Index to compare cost of living. This assumes net earnings (after income tax).</p>
