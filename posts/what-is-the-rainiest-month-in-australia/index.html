<h2 id=what-is-the-rainiest-month-in-australia>What is the rainiest month in Australia?</h2>
<p>The wettest month is usually March, but the wet season will be in effect from November to April.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-it-rain-in-sydney>How often does it rain in Sydney?</h2>
<p>Sydney averages around 14 days of rainfall each month throughout the year.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-it-rain-in-the-australian-outback>How often does it rain in the Australian outback?</h2>
<p>As we’ve said above, rainfall is low, averaging only 150mm per year. It’s very unreliable and can fall at any time of the year. Temperatures in the desert zone average 36-39C in summer and 18-24C in winter. However, summer temperatures of 50 C have been recorded.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-it-rain-and-snow-in-australia>How often does it rain and snow in Australia?</h2>
<p>Australia experiences high temperatures and sunshine throughout the year, and more than 80% of the country receives less than 24 inches of rainfall annually. However, some parts of Australia can receive significant amounts of snow. In fact, numerous Australian cities receive snow regularly.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-least-amount-of-rain-occur-in-australia>Where does the least amount of rain occur in Australia?</h2>
<p>New South Wales. This is also the lowest temperature recorded in the whole of Australia excluding Australian Antarctic Territory. Rainfall varies throughout the state. The far north-west receives the least, less than 180 mm (7 in) annually, while the east receives between 600 to 1,200 mm (24 to 47 in) of rain.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-weather-in-australia-during-the-dry-season>How is the weather in Australia during the dry season?</h2>
<p>During the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%. There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as 14 °C (57 °F), but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-weather-change-in-melbourne-australia>How does the weather change in Melbourne Australia?</h2>
<p>The ocean waters play a big part in the changing weather conditions. It’s common for Melbourne to experience all four seasons in one day ­– one minute it can be sunny before it quickly turns to rain. It’s often warmer and dryer the further north you travel.</p>
