<h2 id=can-you-drop-out-at-16-in-wisconsin>Can you drop out at 16 in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>Even though most states let students drop out at 16 or 17, Wisconsin is one of the exceptions. Students in the La Crosse area – and the rest of the state – must stay in school through their 18th birthday.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-drop-out-at-17-in-wisconsin>Can I drop out at 17 in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>In Wisconsin, the legal age to drop out without permission is 18.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-dropout-of-school-at-16-with-parental-consent-in-wisconsin>Can you dropout of school at 16 with parental consent in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>118.15(1)(b). Written parental permission is required. A student who is 16 years of age or older may be excused by the school board from regular school attendance if the student and his/her parent or guardian agree, in writing, that the child will participate in a program or curriculum modification as listed under Wis.</p>
<h2 id=can-your-parents-stop-you-from-dropping-out>Can your parents stop you from dropping out?</h2>
<p>If you decide you are going to drop out, your parents may decide you must pay your share of the rent, utilities, groceries, etc. If you refuse to follow your directions that may seek legal action to have you defined as an emancipated minor which means they legally can kick you out.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-days-of-school-can-you-miss-in-wisconsin>How many days of school can you miss in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>A child shall not be excused more that ten (10) days in a school year. As per Wisconsin State Statutes all absences beyond ten (10) days would be deemed un-excused and treated accordingly. The School Board requires a child excused under the above to complete any course-work missed during the absence.</p>
<h2 id=at-what-age-can-you-dropout-of-high-school-in-wisconsin>At what age can you dropout of high school in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>Wisconsin students may legally drop out after they turn 18—but not immediately. Learn about the state’s compulsory education law, alternatives to regular school, and when you can earn a GED. Under Wisconsin law, all children between the ages of 6 and 18 must attend school.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-miss-more-than-10-days-of-school-in-wisconsin>What happens if you miss more than 10 days of school in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>As per Wisconsin State Statutes all absences beyond ten (10) days would be deemed un-excused and treated accordingly. The School Board requires a child excused under the above to complete any course-work missed during the absence.</p>
<h2 id=when-to-drop-out-of-school-without-parental-permission>When to drop out of school without parental permission?</h2>
<p>The state’s compulsory education laws don’t specifically say when students can drop out without parental permission. They should have the right to make that decision on their own when they’re no longer minors: at age 18 or when they become legally emancipated. (Fla. Stat. §39.01(12) (2019).)</p>
<h2 id=can-a-child-drop-out-of-school-in-florida>Can a child drop out of school in Florida?</h2>
<p>Florida students can legally drop out of school after they turn 16, but they need their parents’ permission. Every state has “compulsory education” laws that require school attendance. In Florida, that means children between the ages of 6 and 16 must attend full-time school until they graduate.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-drop-out-of-high-school>How old do you have to be to drop out of high school?</h2>
<p>Generally, a 17 year old is still a minor and her/his parent is responsible until the age of majority, 18. Stick it out the best you can. you turn 18 within a year and can decide for yourself, at that point.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-age-of-consent-in-wisconsin>What is the age of consent in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>Laws about consent may be different depending on the type of sex—vaginal, anal or oral—and the genders of those having sex. The age of consent in Wisconsin is 18. Wisconsin has non-discrimination laws or policies for students in school that protect students based on sexual orientation but not gender identity.</p>
