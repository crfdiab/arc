<p>The Pueblo Revolt of 1680<br>
The Pueblo Revolt of 1680, also known as Popé’s Rebellion or Popay’s Rebellion, was an uprising of most of the indigenous Pueblo people against the Spanish colonizers in the province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, larger than present-day New Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-at-the-pueblo-revolt>What happened at the Pueblo Revolt?</h2>
<p>The uprising, also known as Popé’s Rebellion, killed over 400 Spaniards and drove the remaining 2,000 Spanish settlers south toward Mexico. Participants in the rebellion also destroyed many mission churches in an effort to diminish Catholic physical presence on Pueblo land.</p>

<p>Many Pueblo peoples were forced to become servants in Spanish homes. Sometimes the Spaniards would cut off one foot of young adult males as a way to control them. The Spanish priests tried to convert the Pueblo peoples to Christianity. They pressured the Pueblo Indians by hanging, whipping, or putting them in prison.</p>

<h2 id=when-did-the-spanish-take-over-new-mexico>When did the Spanish take over New Mexico?</h2>
<p>Spanish conquest and settlement of all New Mexico followed slowly but remorselessly, bringing the trouble expected by the Hopis to their remote province of Tusayan. In 1598, the Spanish “received the formal submission of the Hopi villages to the King of Spain,” Waters wrote.</p>

<p>August 10, 2015, marked the 335 th anniversary of the Pueblo Indian uprising, during which they expelled the Spanish usurpers and tormentors from New Mexico. Modern Pueblo Indians call August 10 Independence Day.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-spanish-explorer-to-visit-new-mexico>Who was the first Spanish explorer to visit New Mexico?</h2>
<p>Exaggerated rumors about the hidden riches of these Pueblo cities encouraged the first full-scale Spanish expedition into New Mexico, led by Francisco Vasquez de Coronado in 1540. Instead of encountering the long-departed Pueblo people, the Spanish explorers met other indigenous groups, like the Apaches,…</p>
