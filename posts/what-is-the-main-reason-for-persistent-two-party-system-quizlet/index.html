<p>Why does the US have a two-party system? The US has a two-party political system because of two structural features in American politics: single-member districts and winner-take-all elections. Both features encourage the existence of 2 major parties, as smaller parties face great difficulty in winning elective office.</p>

<p>Advantages. Some historians have suggested that two-party systems promote centrism and encourage political parties to find common positions which appeal to wide swaths of the electorate. It can lead to political stability which leads, in turn, to economic growth.</p>

<p>A party system in which two major parties regularly win the vast majority of votes in general elections, regularly capture nearly all of the seats in the legislature, and alternately control the executive branch of government. …</p>

<h2 id=is-the-united-states-a-two-party-system>Is the United States a two-party system?</h2>
<p>The modern two-party system consists of the “Democratic” Party and the “Republican” Party. These two parties have won every United States presidential election since 1852 and have controlled the United States Congress since at least 1856.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-us-have-a-two-party-system>Why does the US have a two party system?</h2>
<p>Although there are other parties that do appear, they usually don’t have a chance to get represented in the government. Two-party systems are very rare among democratic countries. Most democratic countries decided to go with proportional representation and therefore have coalition governments.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-symbols-of-the-two-party-system>What are the symbols of the two party system?</h2>
<p>The presence of divergent interests under a single party canopy masks a process of struggle and compromise that under a multiparty system is out in the open. Symbols of the two main American political parties, the elephant (Republican Party) and the donkey (Democratic Party).</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-have-two-parties-in-parliament>Why do we have two parties in Parliament?</h2>
<p>Like in the U.S., the party that holds the majority keeps changing over the years. The two-party system is supposed to grant more stability because the winning party can have the majority in the parliament and govern without forming coalitions as in multi-party systems.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-third-party-win-in-a-two-party-system>Can a third party win in a two party system?</h2>
<p>Usually only two fairly evenly matched parties may successfully compete for office in a single-member district, and a third party suffers recurring defeat unless it can swallow up one of the other parties. Parties do not thrive under the certainty of defeat.</p>
