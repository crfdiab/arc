<h2 id=what-causes-degradation-of-environment-how-can-we-check-it>What causes degradation of environment how can we check it?</h2>
<p>Pollution Pollution, in whatever form, whether it is air, water, land or noise is harmful to the environment. Air pollution pollutes the air that we breathe, which causes health issues. Land pollution results in the degradation of the earth’s surface as a result of human activities.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-understand-by-environmental-degradation>What do you understand by environmental degradation?</h2>
<p>Environmental degradation is a series of actions through which we weaken or harm the natural environment, reduce its biological diversity and encroach on the general health of the natural infrastructure. Though environment can be degraded naturally, anthropogenic impacts on the environment fast-track its degradation.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-a-check-on-environmental-degradation-important>Why is a check on environmental degradation important?</h2>
<p>Its objective was to check deterioration in the quality of environment. It is necessary for environmental protection that air and water pollution caused by industrial development should be controlled properly. To avoid agricultural pollution, use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers should be minimized.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-effects-of-environmental-degradation>What are the main effects of environmental degradation?</h2>
<p>Continued environmental degradation can completely destroy the various aspects of the environment such as biodiversity, ecosystems, natural resources, and habitats. For instance, air pollution can lead to the formation of acid rain which can in turn reduce the quality of natural water systems by making them acidic.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-examples-of-environmental-degradation>What are examples of environmental degradation?</h2>
<p>Deforestation is an example of environmental degradation. Environmental degradation is the deterioration (causing degenerative harm) of the environment through exhaustion of natural assets such as water, soil, and air including the ecosystem, habitat intrusion, wildlife extermination, and environmental pollution.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-way-to-prevent-environmental-degradation>Which is the best way to prevent environmental degradation?</h2>
<p>Give Back to the Environment. The best possible way to help prevent environmental degradation, is to give back to the environment. You can do this successfully by planting three trees for every one that is cut down for the forestry industry. When it comes to the planet’s trees, you can never have enough.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-environmental-degradation-an-issue-of-concern>How is environmental degradation an issue of concern?</h2>
<p>This is a major issue of concern as it can lead to ecological degradation as well as increasing societal vulnerability. All in all, it can affect us, humans, in many ways. Environmental degradation has led to the deaths of many over the years. There has also been an increase in illnesses as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-be-done-to-improve-the-environment>What can be done to improve the environment?</h2>
<p>Successful action to improve environmental qualities depends mainly on the acceptance by industry and local authorities of the need to reduce greatly both quantities and toxicity of certain wastes at present being discharged into the sea and the modernization and expansion of sewage disposal systems. 18.</p>
