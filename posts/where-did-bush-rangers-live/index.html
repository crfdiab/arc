<h2 id=where-did-bush-rangers-live>Where did Bush Rangers live?</h2>
<p>A bushranger was a thief who lived in the Australian bush. Bushrangers often stole expensive things from banks or coaches. There were more than 2000 bushrangers during Australia’s past. Most were simply criminals and thieves.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-known-as-australias-most-famous-bush-ranger>Who is known as Australia’s most famous bush ranger?</h2>
<p>Here are some of Australia’s most notorious bushrangers:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Kelly Gang.</li>
<li>‘Mad Dog’ Daniel Morgan.</li>
<li>Alexander Pearce.</li>
<li>‘Gentleman Bushranger’ Martin Cash.</li>
<li>‘Bold Jack’ John Donohoe.</li>
<li>‘Black Douglas’ Charles Russell.</li>
<li>Michael Howe.</li>
<li>‘Captain Thunderbolt’ Frederick Ward.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-are-australian-cowboys-called>What are Australian cowboys called?</h2>
<p>Stockman<br>
Stockman is essentially the same word as “cowboy” in Australian English, especially since the cowboy moniker can refer to a tradesman whose work is of shoddy and questionable value, e.g., “a cowboy plumber”.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-bushrangers-stop-in-australia>When did bushrangers stop in Australia?</h2>
<p>1850s<br>
The era of convict bushrangers gradually faded with the decline in penal transportations to Australia in the 1840s. It had ceased by the 1850s to all colonies except Western Australia, which accepted convicts between 1850 and 1868.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-men-turn-bushranging>Why did men turn bushranging?</h2>
<p>Men would have had different reasons for turning to bushranging. Some, like thousands of the convicts transported to NSW, turned to crime out of desperation because of unemployment, or poverty. There were also criminals (like the bushranger Dan Morgan) who were violent offenders and had a history of criminal behaviour.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-the-bushrangers-in-australia>What was life like for the Bushrangers in Australia?</h2>
<p>“Life as a convict was tough.”. As far as historical figures go, bushrangers had all the right ingredients for a great saga – drama, betrayal, murder, martyrdom, love and loathing. They generated significant social interest and people often followed their illicit endeavours salaciously illustrated newspapers.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-famous-bushranger-in-nsw-in-1879>Who was the famous bushranger in NSW in 1879?</h2>
<p>In 1879, the NSW bushranger known as Captain Moonlite was captured by police after a shootout. During the battle, a policeman was killed. Moonlite was executed in 1880 – this was the same year in which another famous bushranger, Ned Kelly, was hanged for his crimes in Victoria.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-only-survivor-of-the-tasmanian-bushrangers>Who was the only survivor of the Tasmanian bushrangers?</h2>
<p>Pearce was the only survivor. He had made it as far as the Derwent River, Tasmania where he joined up with other bushrangers. Eventually, he was captured by authorities near Hobart and was returned to Macquarie Harbour. Pearce attempted another escape shortly thereafter, this time with only one other convict.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-bushranger-during-the-gold-rush>Who was the bushranger during the Gold Rush?</h2>
<p>During the gold rush years, bushrangers were mostly young, Australian-born men. They were often good horsemen and knew how to live comfortably in the bush.</p>
