<h2 id=will-it-snow-in-2020-in-nc>Will it snow in 2020 in NC?</h2>
<p>Could We Still See Snow? The long range outlook for winter 2020-2021 is for warmer and drier than average conditions across North Carolina. That does not necessarily mean, though, that snow-lovers should give up hope.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-it-snowed-in-nc>When was the last time it snowed in NC?</h2>
<p>The storm brought approximately 36 inches of snow to North Carolina’s Newfound Gap, 4 feet in Mount Mitchell, and some parts of the northwest region received up to 3 feet of snow. Another significant snowfall occurred in January 2000, when Raleigh received over 20 inches of snow, and 18 inches of snow fell in the Wilmington area in December 1989.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-snow-on-the-mountains-in-north-carolina>Is there snow on the mountains in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Snow on the mountains of North Carolina. North Carolina is a US state located in the southwestern region of the country. It is bordered by several other states, including South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee, and also borders the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-it-snow-in-charlotte-nc>How often does it snow in Charlotte NC?</h2>
<p>In the Piedmont-Triad region, which is located further west, the average snowfall is 9 inches, and the Charlotte area receives an average of 6.5 inches annually. The mountains help prevent snowstorms from reaching Piedmont, but when snowstorms do make it beyond the mountain, they are usually light and rarely reach the ground.</p>

<p>See what to expect this winter. (Shutterstock) NORTH CAROLINA — If you assumed the United States is in for a terrible winter with below-freezing temperatures and apocalyptic amounts of snow for no other reason except it’s 2020, we wouldn’t blame you. However, you might also be jumping to conclusions.</p>
