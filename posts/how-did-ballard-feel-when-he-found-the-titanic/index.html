<p>The thought of it hit Ballard like a shock. “We were embarrassed we were celebrating,” he later told 60 Minutes. “And all of a sudden we realized that we should not be dancing on someone’s grave.” More than 73 years had passed since the Titanic left on its doomed maiden voyage to New York.</p>

<p>1985<br>
Robert Ballard, in full Robert Duane Ballard, (born June 30, 1942, Wichita, Kansas, U.S.), American oceanographer and marine geologist whose pioneering use of deep-diving submersibles laid the foundations for deep-sea archaeology. He is best known for discovering the wreck of the Titanic in 1985.</p>

<p>It was also required that ships maintain a 24-hour radio watch. On September 1, 1985, a joint U.S.-French expedition located the wreck of the Titanic lying on the ocean floor at a depth of about 13,000 feet. The ship was explored by manned and unmanned submersibles, which shed new light on the details of its sinking.</p>

<p>Several priceless items of jewellery were recovered in a purse on the Titanic during a 1987 research mission. The collection includes necklaces, diamond and sapphire rings, brooches and a gold pocket watch. To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the ship’s sinking the jewellery went on public display in 2012.</p>

<p>On September 1, 1985, a joint American-French expedition, headed by famous American oceanographer Dr. Robert Ballard, found the Titanicover two miles below the ocean’s surface by using an unmanned submersible called Argo. This discovery gave new meaning to the Titanic’ssinking and gave birth to new dreams in ocean exploration.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1985, Ballard was aboard the French research ship Le Suroît, which was using the side scan sonar SAR to search for Titanic ‘s wreck. When the French ship was recalled, Ballard transferred onto a ship from Woods Hole, the R/V Knorr.</p>

<p>Editor’s Note: Twenty years ago, James Cameron’s blockbuster film “Titanic” entranced audiences around the globe. But it was less than 10 years ago that Robert Ballard, the oceanographer who discovered the Titanic in 1985, revealed to the world that he found the famous shipwreck as the result of a top-secret military expedition.</p>

<p>But that was a ruse. Speaking to CNN on Thursday about now-declassified events, Robert Ballard, who discovered the Titanic, said that the expedition was part of a secret US military mission to recover two sunken nuclear submarines on the bottom of the ocean. “They did not want the world to know that, so I had to have a cover story,” Ballard said.</p>
