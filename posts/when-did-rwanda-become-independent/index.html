<h2 id=when-did-rwanda-become-independent>When did Rwanda become independent?</h2>
<p>July 1, 1962<br>
Rwanda/Founded<br>
Pre-Crisis Phase (July 1, 1962-December 19, 1963): Rwanda formally achieved its independence from UN trusteeship under Belgian administration on July 1, 1962.</p>
<h2 id=who-controlled-rwanda-during-imperialism>Who controlled Rwanda during imperialism?</h2>
<p>The Kingdom of Rwanda was ruled by the Mwami (King), and the kingdom reached the height of its territorial expansion in the late 1800s[iii]. In 1899 Rwanda was colonised by the German Empire as it was officially incorporated into German East Africa and ruled indirectly through King Musinga’s puppet government[iv].</p>
<h2 id=who-owned-rwanda>Who owned Rwanda?</h2>
<p>Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during World War I. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population revolted in 1959.</p>
<h2 id=are-tutsis-taller-than-hutus>Are Tutsis taller than Hutus?</h2>
<p>The two ethnic groups are actually very similar – they speak the same language, inhabit the same areas and follow the same traditions. However, Tutsis are often taller and thinner than Hutus, with some saying their origins lie in Ethiopia.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-rwanda-gain-independence-from-the-un>When did Rwanda gain independence from the UN?</h2>
<p>Rwanda (1962-present) Pre-Crisis Phase (July 1, 1962-December 19, 1963): Rwanda formally achieved its independence from UN trusteeship under Belgian administration on July 1, 1962.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-rwanda-under-german-and-belgian-control>When was Rwanda under German and Belgian control?</h2>
<p>Rwanda under German and Belgian control From 1894 to 1918, Rwanda, along with Burundi, was part of German East Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-state-of-rwanda-in-the-19th-century>What was the state of Rwanda in the 19th century?</h2>
<p>The Gisaka state in southeast Rwanda was powerful, maintaining its independence until the mid-19th century. However, the latter two states are largely unmentioned in contemporary discussion of Rwandan civilization. In the 19th century, the state became far more centralized, and the history far more precise.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-majority-of-the-population-in-rwanda>Who was the majority of the population in Rwanda?</h2>
<p>Rwandan Ethnic Tensions. By the early 1990s, Rwanda, a small country with an overwhelmingly agricultural economy, had one of the highest population densities in Africa. About 85 percent of its population was Hutu; the rest were Tutsi, along with a small number of Twa, a Pygmy group who were the original inhabitants of Rwanda.</p>
