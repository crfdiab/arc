<h2 id=who-has-had-the-longest-burp>Who has had the longest burp?</h2>
<p>Michele Forgione<br>
The longest burp is 1 minute 13 seconds 57 milliseconds and was achieved by Michele Forgione (Italy), also known as Rutt Mysterio, at the 13th annual Hard Rock Beer festival ‘Ruttosound’ competition, in Reggiolo, Italy, on 16 June 2009.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-make-the-loudest-burp>How do you make the loudest burp?</h2>
<p>Make a straight pathway from your stomach to your mouth by extending your shoulders upward and stretching your back. You want to allow the gas travel as smoothly as possible from your stomach out in order to produce the loudest burp. Release the burp. Let the accumulated gas go all at once.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-world-record-for-the-longest-hug>What is the world record for the longest hug?</h2>
<p>Joe Snape and Will Jarvis broke the record for the longest recorded hug, standing at 36 hours, 36 minutes, and 36 seconds between Saturday 23rd and Sunday 24th June 2018.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-loudest-recorded-burp>What is the loudest recorded burp?</h2>
<p>109.9 decibels<br>
Humpty Doo man Neville Sharp decided to challenge a Guinness World Record for the loudest burp after being egged on by his mates at the local pub. The record has been held by UK man Paul Dunn for a burp of 109.9 decibels.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-loudest-burp-in-the-world>What was the loudest burp in the world?</h2>
<p>Long-time Tales from the Tinny church member Neville Sharp has broken the world record for the loudest burp. Conducted to the rigorous specifications of The Australian Book of Records, Nev’s 112.4 decibel belch beat the previous Guinness record of 109.9 decibels, held since 2009 by the UK’s Paul Hunn.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-loudest-fart-on-record>What is the loudest fart on record?</h2>
<p>The loudest fart ever recorded occurred on May 16, 1972 in Madeline, Texas by Alvin Meshits. The blast maintained a level of 194 decibels for one third of a second.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-worlds-loudest-burp>What is the world’s loudest burp?</h2>
<p>112.4 decibels<br>
Mr Sharp’s burp blasted through the ABC Studios in Darwin at a whopping 112.4 decibels. According to one decibel comparison chart that’s somewhere between a motorcycle and a loud rock concert. Neville’s older sister, Sandie Hunt, taught him how to burp when he was a six-year-old – and he has been practising ever since.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-longest-someone-has-slept-for>What’s the longest someone has slept for?</h2>
<p>Previously, Peter Tripp held the first record at 201 hours and suffered from hallucinations for several days after. Between Peter and Randy, Honolulu DJ Tom Rounds made it to 260 hours. Randy tapped out at 264 hours, and slept for 14 hours straight after.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-loudest-yell-ever>What was the loudest yell ever?</h2>
<p>‘Quietttt!!! What was the sound? No other than their teacher, who just happens to have the world’s loudest shout. Miss Flanagan entered the record books back in 1994 with a thunderous rendition of ‘quiet!’ The shout clocked up an earth-shattering 121.7 decibels, setting a world record.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-loudest-person-on-earth>Who is the loudest person on earth?</h2>
<p>Lemkuil is the World’s Loudest Man. How loud is loud? Lemkuil tops out at 117 decibels, measured at a distance of 8 feet, 2 inches, and has his Guinness certificate to prove it. By comparison, to anyone but a teen-ager 110 decibels is considered the human ear’s “pain threshold.”</p>
<h2 id=can-a-fart-kill>Can a fart kill?</h2>
<p>There is no evidence that holding in a fart could kill you, though the pain and discomfort doing so causes can be severe.</p>
