<h2 id=what-were-the-social-reasons-for-united-states-expansion>What were the social reasons for United States expansion?</h2>
<p>Reasons the U.S. tried to influence other nations: (1) Economic (2) Military (3) Moral. The primary reason the U.S. expanded its influence in foreign countries: Economic reasons – industrialization in the late 1800s increased the need to trade with other countries.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-political-expansion>What is political expansion?</h2>
<p>In expansionism, governments and states expand their territory, power, wealth or influence through economic growth, soft power, military empire-building or colonialism.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-expand-politically>How did the US expand politically?</h2>
<p>Expansion (1820-1849) During the early 1800’s, settlers moved westward over the Appalachian Mountains into the new states and territories. The build-up of the West gave rise to changes in American politics. …</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-westward-expansion>What caused westward expansion?</h2>
<p>Westward expansion, the 19th-century movement of settlers into the American West, began with the Louisiana Purchase and was fueled by the Gold Rush, the Oregon Trail and a belief in “manifest destiny.”</p>
<h2 id=what-was-a-political-cause-of-manifest-destiny>What was a political cause of Manifest Destiny?</h2>
<p>Expansionism is the political belief of territorial expansion. Manifest Destiny claimed that it was the objective of the United States to absorb all of North America. Land is associated with wealth, political power and independence.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-political-and-social-impact-of-imperialism>What was the political and social impact of imperialism?</h2>
<p>It violently jolted their entire development and drastically altered its course. By breaking up the age-old patterns of their agrarian economy, and by forcing shifts to the production of exportable crops, western capitalism destroyed the self-sufficiency of the underdeveloped country–that is, its rural society.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-political-economic-and-social-causes-of-imperialism>What were the political economic and social causes of imperialism?</h2>
<p>Imperialism is when strong nations dominate the weaker ones by political, economic or cultural life. The main causes for countries to seek expansion of their territories were military and political reasons, humanitarian and religious goals, social Darwinism, Western technology and especially economic motives.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-western-expansion-affect-society-socially-and>How did western expansion affect society socially and?</h2>
<p>Many Eastern European immigrants moved west and helped to turn the Plains into the breadbasket that it is today. Not all social changes in the West were positive, however. Native Americans were viewed as obstacles and were pushed onto smaller and smaller reservations.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-economic-and-social-causes-of-world-war-2>What was the economic and social causes of World War 2?</h2>
<p>Politically: Bad economic times and fear of another terrible war made European countries at the mercy of a political bully and opportunist like Hitler. Socially: The losses of millions of men in WWI profoundly affected the survivors. Women had been given important home front roles during the War and then had them taken away when the men returned.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-problem-with-the-westward-expansion>What was the problem with the westward expansion?</h2>
<p>And as America expanded, so did the sectionalism. The rifts between the North and the South, caused by conflicting views on Westward Expansion were becoming more evident. Not only were the debates over westward expansion tedious; the ever growing social debate was also becoming alarmingly prevalent.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-political-economic-and-social-consequences-of-imperialism>What are the political, economic and social consequences of imperialism?</h2>
<p>Imperialism: political, economic, & social consequences When one tries to analyze the political, economic and social consequences of racism and the in the exploitation of the undeveloped in order for capitalism to function.</p>
