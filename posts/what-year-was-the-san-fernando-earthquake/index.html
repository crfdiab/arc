<p>February 9, 1971<br>
1971 San Fernando earthquake/Start dates</p>
<p>On February 9, 1971 at 6:01 am PST, a devastating M6. 6 earthquake struck the densely populated metropolitan area of Los Angeles, leaving death and destruction in its wake. The epicenter of the earthquake was in the vicinity of Magic Mountain, about six miles northeast of Sylmar, at a depth of about seven miles.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-1971-earthquake-in-la>How big was the 1971 earthquake in LA?</h2>
<p>magnitude 6.6<br>
The magnitude 6.6 Sylmar earthquake that shook Southern California on Feb. 9, 1971, caused significant damage and 64 deaths. What few realized at the time was how close it came to being far more catastrophic. The disaster still holds lessons 50 years later.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-the-1994-earthquake-last>How long did the 1994 earthquake last?</h2>
<p>20 seconds<br>
The earthquake occurred just after 4:30 am local time along a previously undiscovered blind thrust fault in the San Fernando Valley. Its epicentre was in Northridge, a suburb located about 20 miles (32 km) west-northwest of downtown Los Angeles. The major shock lasted 10–20 seconds and registered a magnitude of 6.7.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-the-earthquake-in-la-last>How long did the earthquake in LA last?</h2>
<p>It occurred at 4:30:55 a.m. (PST) and was located in the San Fernando Valley region in the County of Los Angeles. The quake had a duration of approximately 10–20 seconds, and its peak ground acceleration of 1.82 g0 (17.8 m/s2) was the highest ever instrumentally recorded in an urban area in North America.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-last-major-earthquake-la>When was last major earthquake LA?</h2>
<p>On March 17, 2014, a magnitude 4.4 earthquake occurred about two miles south-southeast of Encino. The earthquake was felt in Los Angeles, Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange counties. This was the largest earthquake in Los Angeles since the aftershocks of the 1994 Northridge quake.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-san-fernando-valley-have-an-earthquake>When did the San Fernando Valley have an earthquake?</h2>
<p>How right they were was demonstrated 23 years later, when almost the same areas of the San Fernando Valley were again struck by a damaging earthquake. During the Northridge earthquake in January 1994, more than 50 people were killed and the quake caused damage worth $35 billion.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-earthquake-in-los-angeles-in-1994>Where was the earthquake in Los Angeles in 1994?</h2>
<p>At 4:31 a.m. on January 17, 1994, a 6.7-magnitude quake struck the San Fernando Valley, a densely populated area of Los Angeles located 20 miles northwest of the city’s downtown.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-largest-lateral-slip-in-the-san-fernando-earthquake>Where was the largest lateral slip in the San Fernando earthquake?</h2>
<p>While lateral, transverse, and vertical motions were all observed, the largest individual component of movement was 5 ft 3 in (1.60 m) of left lateral slip near the middle of the Sylmar segment. The largest cumulative amount of slip of 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) occurred along the Sylmar and Tujunga segments.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-costliest-earthquake-in-us-history>What was the costliest earthquake in US history?</h2>
<p>The Northridge quake, named after the San Fernando Valley community near its epicenter, was the costliest in U.S. history, with damages estimated at more than $20 billion, and resulted in 57 deaths Northridge Earthquake: Jan</p>
