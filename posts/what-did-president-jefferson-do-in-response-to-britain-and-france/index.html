<h2 id=what-did-president-jefferson-do-in-response-to-britain-and-france>What did President Jefferson do in response to Britain and France?</h2>
<p>Embargo Act, (1807), U.S. Pres. Thomas Jefferson’s nonviolent resistance to British and French molestation of U.S. merchant ships carrying, or suspected of carrying, war materials and other cargoes to European belligerents during the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jefferson-do-about-the-embargo-act>What did Jefferson do about the Embargo Act?</h2>
<p>President Thomas Jefferson hoped that the Embargo Act of 1807 would help the United States by demonstrating to Britain and France their dependence on American goods, convincing them to respect American neutrality and stop impressing American seamen. Instead, the act had a devastating effect on American trade.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-jefferson-attempt-to-avoid-armed-conflict-with-great-britain-and-france>How did Jefferson attempt to avoid armed conflict with Great Britain and France?</h2>
<p>The French, led by Napoleon, closed the port of New Orleans off for American shipping. Jefferson tried to avoid war by offering to buy New Orleans, instead, Napoleon offered the sale of the entire Louisiana Territory.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jefferson-do-to-the-embargo-before-leaving-office>What did Jefferson do to the embargo before leaving office?</h2>
<p>But the embargo proved very difficult to enforce, as many people smuggled goods between the United States and British Canada. At the very end of his presidency, Jefferson signed the Non-Intercourse Act of 1808, lifting the unpopular embargoes on trade with all countries except Britain and France.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-embargo-act-affect-jeffersons-popularity>How did the Embargo Act affect Jefferson’s popularity?</h2>
<p>The Embargo Act affected Thomas Jefferson’s popularity by damaging it and increasing the Federalists’ popularity. The Embargo Act was not very successful because the merchants did not have any money because they didn’t have any access to foreign countries.</p>
<h2 id=what-action-did-jefferson-do-that-may-have-been-unconstitutional>What action did Jefferson do that may have been unconstitutional?</h2>
<p>The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions were political statements drafted in 1798 and 1799 in which the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures took the position that the federal Alien and Sedition Acts were unconstitutional.</p>
<h2 id=what-wiped-out-trade-between-the-us-and-great-britain-and-france>What wiped out trade between the US and Great Britain and France?</h2>
<p>War of 1812–1815 The embargo and non-intercourse act proved ineffective and in 1810 the United States reopened trade with France and Great Britain provided they ceased their blockades against neutral trading.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-embargo-act>What was the result of the Embargo Act?</h2>
<p>Economically, the embargo devastated American shipping exports and cost the American economy about 8 percent in decreased gross national product in 1807. With the embargo in place, American exports declined by 75%, and imports declined by 50%—the act did not completely eliminate trade and domestic partners.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jeffersons-embargo-do>What did Jefferson’s Embargo do?</h2>
<p>The Embargo Act of 1807 was an attempt by President Thomas Jefferson and the U.S. Congress to prohibit American ships from trading in foreign ports. It was intended to punish Britain and France for interfering with American trade while the two major European powers were at war with each other.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-reaction-to-the-embargo-act-of-1807>What was the reaction to the Embargo Act of 1807?</h2>
<p>Embargo, etching by Alexander Anderson, reflecting a hostile reaction to the Embargo Act of 1807. By 1807 the struggle between England and France had degenerated into a war of economic retribution, as each side attempted to starve the other into submission.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-jefferson-use-peaceable-coercion-in-1807>Why did Jefferson use peaceable coercion in 1807?</h2>
<p>“peaceable coercion” was President Jefferson’s strategy of using economic pressure to force France and Britain to respect the US’s right to trade as a neutral country. In 1807, France and Great Britain were at war. They had been in conflict with one another for some years due to the French Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-us-trade-with-britain-before-the-embargo>What was the US trade with Britain before the embargo?</h2>
<p>Before the embargo, exports to the United States reached $108 million. One year later, they were just over $22 million. Yet Britain and France, locked in the Napoleonic Wars, were not greatly damaged by the loss of trade with Americans.</p>
