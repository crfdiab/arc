<h2 id=can-someone-in-mexico-claim-child-support>Can someone in Mexico claim child support?</h2>
<p>Yes and not likely. Yes, the law provides for the establishment of an order against someone who lives in Mexico. California has an agreement with Mexico to enforce and establish support orders against Mexican residents.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-child-support-work-if-parents-live-in-different-states>How does child support work if parents live in different states?</h2>
<p>When parents live in different states When the parents live in different states or countries, a child support case can be opened at the child support agency in the state where the parent or guardian lives. The agency will establish and enforce the child support order and ask the other state or country for help.</p>
<h2 id=does-child-support-consider-both-parents-income>Does child support consider both parents income?</h2>
<p>For the purposes of calculating child support, each parent has a Child Support Income. It is your taxable income minus the Self-Support Amount minus the costs of any dependents. Child Support Income quantifies your capacity to maintain children financially.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-live-in-boyfriend-affect-child-support>Does a live in boyfriend affect child support?</h2>
<p>If the person you live with is not your children’s parent, then that person has no obligation to support your children. The amount of child support your ex-spouse is ordered to pay usually isn’t affected by the fact that you live with someone else.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-prove-a-child-is-living-with-you>How do you prove a child is living with you?</h2>
<p>The most direct way to prove the child is yours to claim is with her birth certificate. The birth certificate enables you to both prove parentage and apply for other legal proofs, such as a Social Security number, and register her for school.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-child-support-go-when-a-mother-receives-public-assistance>Where does child support go when a mother receives public assistance?</h2>
<p>In some cases such as when the child’s mother receives public assistance, any child support paid by the father will go directly toward the state where it is then split with the federal government.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-if-your-mother-owes-you-child-support>What to do if your mother owes you child support?</h2>
<p>If you are owed court-ordered child support by your child’s mother, federal law requires the state or district attorney to help you collect delinquent child support payments. Most states have a bureaucracy (which may have a name like the Office of Recovery Services) available to collect these payments.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-entitled-to-child-support-in-michigan>Who is entitled to child support in Michigan?</h2>
<p>A person can receive child support if all of the following apply: • (S)he is the parent of a minor child or is the person who has responsibility for a minor child. • The minor child lives in the person’s home. • The minor child is financially dependent on that person.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-responsible-for-child-support-after-a-divorce>Who is responsible for child support after a divorce?</h2>
<p>Both parents have the responsibility to support their children financially. When a divorce occurs and one parent has physical custody of the children, that parent’s responsibility is fulfilled by being the custodial parent. The other parent then makes a child support payment to fulfill their non-custodial parent financial responsibilities.</p>
