<h2 id=does-hawaii-receive-snow-every-year>Does Hawaii receive snow every year?</h2>
<p>The highest summits on the Big Island — Mauna Kea (13,803′) and Mauna Loa (13,678′) — are the only two locations in the state to receive snow on a yearly basis. As a result, deep snow banks and wind-sculpted ice formations often form in the wake of winter storms. …</p>
<h2 id=how-much-snow-does-hawaii-get-per-year>How much snow does Hawaii get per year?</h2>
<p>Yes, It Actually Snows in Hawaii “The snow level almost never gets below 9,000 feet in Hawaii during the winter, but since these mountains are taller than 13,600 feet, 13,700 feet and 10,000 feet, respectively, they get dusted with snow a few times a year. It rarely stays on the ground for more than a few days though.”</p>
<h2 id=how-cold-does-hawaii-get>How cold does Hawaii get?</h2>
<p>Temperature. Temperatures at sea level generally range from highs of 84–88 °F (29–31 °C) during the summer months to 79–83 °F (26–28 °C) during the winter months. Rarely does the temperature rise from above 90 °F (32 °C) or drop below 60 °F (16 °C) at lower elevations. Temperatures are lower at higher altitudes.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-it-snow-in-hawaii-in-the-winter>Where does it snow in Hawaii in the winter?</h2>
<p>Snow in Hawaii. Some parts of Hawaii receive snow. The islands experience nonseasonal snowstorms only at the summits of the state’s three tallest volcanoes, which all have elevations greater than 10,000 feet: Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and Haleakala. During the winter, it rarely snows in areas of Hawaii that have an elevation below 9000 feet.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-it-snow-in-hawaii-volcanoes>How often does it snow in Hawaii Volcanoes?</h2>
<p>The Hawaiian islands experience nonseasonal snowstorms only at the summits of the state’s three tallest volcanoes. The summits of the three mountains may receive 2-8 inches of snow each year.

<h2 id=is-it-warm-in-hawaii-all-the-time>Is it warm in Hawaii all the time?</h2>
<p>Yes, Hawaii is warm year-round and there is no snow 99% of the time, but there are actually several occasions where snow can be found in Hawaii. 1. Weird Weather Several times in my life, I have read about hail falling somewhere in Hawaii.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-snowing-at-mauna-kea-in-hawaii>Is it snowing at Mauna Kea in Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Up to 2 inches of snow and icy roads are expected on the summits, where temperatures are nearing the freezing mark, along with snow and rain, according to Weather.com. “Fog, ice, clouds and high humidity will continue to plague the summit through the night,” Mauna Kea Weather Center’s forecasters wrote Tuesday evening.</p>
