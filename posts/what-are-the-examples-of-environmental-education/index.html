<h2 id=what-are-the-examples-of-environmental-education>What are the examples of environmental education?</h2>
<p>There are also ways that environmental education is taught outside the traditional classroom. Aquariums, zoos, parks, and nature centers all have ways of teaching the public about the environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-your-understanding-about-environmental-education>What is your understanding about environmental education?</h2>
<p>Environmental Education (EE) is a process in which individuals gain awareness of their environment and acquire knowledge, skills, values, experiences, and also the determination, which will enable them to act – individually and collectively – to solve present and future environmental problems.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-study-environmental-education>Why do we study environmental education?</h2>
<p>This type of learning entails discovering the environment around us, learning about the problems faced in protecting it, deepening one’s understanding of these issues, supplying the learners with a skillset for effective problem-solving and teaching them how to make responsible decisions where the environment is …</p>
<h2 id=is-the-environmental-education-important-for-all>Is the environmental education important for all?</h2>
<p>Education forms the basis of everything in today’s world including environment. Environmental Education imparts knowledge about the current situation and future prospects of nature. It teaches people to explore all the problems related to environment, and engage in wise ways of preserving it.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-reasons-why-environmental-science-is-important>What are two reasons why environmental science is important?</h2>
<p>Environmental science is important because it enables you to understand how these relationships work. For example, humans breathe out carbon dioxide, which plants need for photosynthesis. Plants, on the other hand, produce and release oxygen to the atmosphere, which humans need for respiration.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-disciplines-in-environmental-education>What are the different disciplines in environmental education?</h2>
<p>It is a multi-disciplinary field integrating disciplines such as biology, chemistry, physics, ecology, earth science, atmospheric science, mathematics, and geography.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-idea-of-environmental-education-come-from>Where does the idea of environmental education come from?</h2>
<p>The roots of environmental education can be traced back as early as the 18th century when Jean-Jacques Rousseau stressed the importance of an education that focuses on the environment in Emile: or, On Education.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-schools-integrating-environment-into-their-curriculum>How are schools integrating environment into their curriculum?</h2>
<p>Schools can integrate environmental education into their curricula with sufficient funding from EE policies. This approach – known as using the “environment as an integrating context” for learning – uses the local environment as a framework for teaching state and district education standards.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-natural-and-social-sciences-important-to-the-environment>Why are natural and Social Sciences important to the environment?</h2>
<p>Here, knowledge from the natural and social sciences is integrated, more adequately reflecting the nature of most environmental problems. Furthermore, by using dependent measures such as CO2 emissions, the impact-oriented approach usually yields more meaningful and thus more practically relevant information for citizens and policy makers.</p>
