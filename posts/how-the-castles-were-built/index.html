<p>Workers use horse-drawn wagons to haul the stones from the quarry to the building site. Stone masons then chisel the raw stone into blocks. Workers use man-powered cranes to lift the finished stones to the scaffolding on the castle wall. Other workers make mortar on the site from lime, soil and water.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-many-castles-in-spain>Why are there many castles in Spain?</h2>

<h2 id=where-is-the-project-to-build-a-medieval-castle>Where is the project to build a medieval castle?</h2>
<p>As an experiment in archaeology, Michel Guyot and Maryline Martin have assembled a team of 50 workers (architects, archaeologists and skilled workers) to build a medieval castle from scratch by using techniques and materials of the Middle Ages. The project, in Treigny in the Burgundy region of France, is called Project Gueledon.</p>
