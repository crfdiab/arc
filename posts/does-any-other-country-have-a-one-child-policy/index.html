<h2 id=does-any-other-country-have-a-one-child-policy>Does any other country have a one-child policy?</h2>
<p>The one-child policy was a program in China that was implemented nationwide by the Chinese government in 1980 in order to limit most Chinese families to one child each. The policy was enacted to address the growth rate of the country’s population, which the government viewed as being too rapid.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-the-world-had-a-one-child-policy>What would happen if the world had a one-child policy?</h2>
<p>As a short-term measure, it will reduce existing population numbers. However, as one child per family is below replacement value, it would lead to Earth’s population shrinking and eventually causing humans to become extinct.</p>
<h2 id=is-chinas-one-child-policy-still-in-effect>Is China’s one-child policy still in effect?</h2>
<p>In October 2015, the Chinese news agency Xinhua announced plans of the government to abolish the one-child policy, now allowing all families to have two children, citing from a communiqué issued by the CPC “to improve the balanced development of population” – an apparent reference to the country’s female-to-male sex …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-one-child-policy-in-china>What was the one child policy in China?</h2>
<p>To make sure “the fruits of economic growth are not devoured by population growth, China in the late 1970s introduced the “one child” policy, with those flouting the rule being penalised and even forced into abortions. But in 2013, the government allowed married couples to have two children if one of the parents was an only child.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-effect-of-one-child-policy>What was the effect of one child policy?</h2>
<p>The effect of a one-child policy on how couples decide to have children is impossible to predict, for example. But there’s another factor: There would have been fewer women aged 15 to 44 once 1995 rolled around.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-couple-have-more-than-one-child>Can a couple have more than one child?</h2>
<p>Worried about the ability to care for so many older people, the country on Thursday announced that it would revamp its longstanding policy limiting many couples to one child. That policy, in place since Sept. 25, 1980, was tweaked in 2013, permitting a second child if one of the parents in the couple is an only child.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-restrictions-on-how-many-kids-you-can-have>Are there any restrictions on how many kids you can have?</h2>
<p>Under the policy, those with more than two children will not be able to get government jobs or avail benefits like government housing or contest local body elections. ET Magazine takes a look at other such restrictions imposed by countries across the world and also incentives offered for people to have more kids.</p>
