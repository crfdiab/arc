<h2 id=what-was-happening-in-russia-in-1900>What was happening in Russia in 1900?</h2>
<p>In the early 1900s, Russia was one of the most impoverished countries in Europe with an enormous peasantry and a growing minority of poor industrial workers. The emancipation of serfs would influence the events leading up to the Russian Revolution by giving peasants more freedom to organize.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-happening-in-russia-in-the-1890s>What was happening in Russia in the 1890s?</h2>
<p>During the 1890s Russia’s industrial development led to a large increase in the size of the urban middle class and of the working class, which gave rise to a more dynamic political atmosphere and the development of radical parties. Politically, anti-establishment forces organized into competing parties.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-russia-expand-in-the-16th-century>Why did Russia expand in the 16th century?</h2>
<p>The time from the 16th to 18th century was the period of expansion. Russia gained much more territory, established a strong army, and modernized the economy. Russian elites failed to produce a suitable strategy for the developing of the state, and there was no widely accepted leader to become a new tsar.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-human-settlement-in-russia>When was the first human settlement in Russia?</h2>

About 2 million years ago, representatives of Homo erectus migrated from Western Asia to the North Caucasus (archaeological site of Kermek [ ru ] on the Taman Peninsula [6] ).</p>
