<p>Humans impact the Grassland Savanna by lessening the area of the land by making new space for industrialization. The trees and animals have less space to be so the population decreases with the land, making everything smaller.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a-savannah-do>What does a savannah do?</h2>
<p>A savanna or savannah is a mixed woodland-grassland ecosystem characterised by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of grasses.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-it-like-in-the-savanna>What is it like in the savanna?</h2>
<p>A savanna is a rolling grassland scattered with shrubs and isolated trees, which can be found between a tropical rainforest and desert biome. Savannas have warm temperature year round. There are actually two very different seasons in a savanna; a very long dry season (winter), and a very wet season (summer).</p>
<h2 id=how-do-people-survive-in-savanna>How do people survive in savanna?</h2>
<p>The people living in this biome are mainly farmers who grow cereals and other plants that can resist long dry spells, such as millet, sorghum, barley and wheat, as well as peanuts, cotton, rice and sugarcane, while breeding prevails in drier savannah areas.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-savanna-and-savannah>What is the difference between savanna and Savannah?</h2>
