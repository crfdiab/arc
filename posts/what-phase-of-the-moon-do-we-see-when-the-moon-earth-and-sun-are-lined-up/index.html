<h2 id=what-phase-of-the-moon-do-we-see-when-the-moon-earth-and-sun-are-lined-up>What phase of the Moon do we see when the Moon Earth and sun are lined up?</h2>
<p>eclipse<br>
When the Moon is exactly lined up with the Sun (as viewed from Earth), we experience an eclipse. As the Moon moves eastward away from the Sun in the sky, we see a bit more of the sunlit side of the Moon each night.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-phase-called-when-the-moon-is-between-the-earth-and-the-sun-and-we-cannot-see-it-in-the-night-sky-at-all>What is the phase called when the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun and we Cannot see it in the night sky at all?</h2>
<p>But following the night of each full moon, as the Moon orbits around Earth, we start to see less of the Moon lit by the Sun. Eventually, the Moon reaches a point in its orbit when we don’t see any of the Moon illuminated. At that point, the far side of the Moon is facing the Sun. This phase is called a new moon.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-sun-moon-and-earth-are-in-a-straight-line>What happens when the Sun moon and Earth are in a straight line?</h2>
<p>During this motion of earth and moon around the sun, there occurs a natural phenomena called eclipse when the sun, moon and earth align in a straight line. The duration when this phenomenon occurs is called the eclipse season. There are two forms of eclipse namely, the solar eclipse and the lunar eclipse.</p>
<h2 id=during-which-phases-are-the-moon-earth-and-sun-aligned>During which phases are the Moon Earth and sun aligned?</h2>
<p>The answer is, it’s a full moon. The moon, Earth and sun are aligned with Earth in the middle. The moon’s fully illuminated half – its dayside – faces Earth’s night side. That’s always the case on the night of a full moon.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-sun-earth-and-moon-work-together>How does Sun Earth and moon work together?</h2>
<p>The Sun warms our planet, and with the Moon, creates the tides. The Moon orbits the Earth and in turn, the Earth orbits the Sun. Because they appear to be the same size in the sky, the Sun, Earth and Moon work together to create eclipses. When the Moon is directly in between the Earth and Sun, we see a solar eclipse.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-moon-have-the-same-phase-as-the-sun>Why does the Moon have the same phase as the Sun?</h2>
<p>The moon will have the same phase and be at the same node and the same distance from Earth. Earth will be nearly the same distance from the sun, and tilted to it in nearly the same orientation. The extra eight hours is the reason why successive eclipses in the same saros cycle happen over different parts of Earth.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-the-moon-is-in-a-straight-line>What does it mean when the Moon is in a straight line?</h2>
<p>Full Moon: The lighted side of the Moon faces the Earth. This means that the Earth, Sun, and Moon are nearly in a straight line, with the Earth in the middle. The Moon that we see is very bright from the sunlight reflecting off it. Last Quarter: Sometimes called Third Quarter.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-moon-appear-to-be-in-an-eclipse>Why does the Moon appear to be in an eclipse?</h2>
<p>The reason is that the Moon’s orbit around the Earth is tilted relative to the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. But if that’s the case, why do eclipses happen at all?</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-see-the-outline-of-the-new-moon>Is it possible to see the outline of the new moon?</h2>
<p>Earth observers may be able to just barely see the outline of the new moon because some sunlight reflects off the Earth and hits the moon. Before and after the quarter-moon phases are the gibbous and crescent phases.</p>
