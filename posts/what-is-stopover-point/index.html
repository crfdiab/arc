<h2 id=what-is-stopover-point>What is stopover point?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPause1 : a stop at an intermediate point in one’s journey. 2 : a stopping place on a journey.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-stopover-flight-mean>What does stopover flight mean?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseWhat’s a stopover? At its simplest, a stopover is simply a longer layover. Most airlines define a layover as any connection of less than 4 hours on a domestic flight or less than 24 hours on an international flight.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-stopover-fee>What is a stopover fee?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseA stopover allows you to stay in a connection city for greater than 24 hours and less than the duration of your trip. In this example, it is an extra $100 plus taxes and fees per stopover.</p>
<h2 id=do-stopovers-cost-more>Do stopovers cost more?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseConnecting flights are normally cheaper than direct ones. And, often, buying a flight with a very long layover/stopover is at least the same price or cheaper as a regular return.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-free-stopover>What is a free stopover?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseFree stopovers let you visit extra cities for the price of one ticket, but policies vary by airline.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-leave-the-airport-during-a-stopover>Can I leave the airport during a stopover?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseFor most layovers, you can leave the transit area (and airport) in between flights, as long as you have a visa (if necessary) and go through customs and immigration on the way out, and of course you’ll have to pass through security again on your way back into the airport.</p>
<h2 id=do-emirates-offer-free-stopovers>Do Emirates offer free stopovers?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseIf your layover is between 10 and 24 hours, you could qualify for a complimentary night at a four- or five-star hotel, plus airport ground transfers, meals at the hotel, and assistance with your UAE visa on arrival, if required. …</p>
<h2 id=do-stopover-flights-cost-more>Do stopover flights cost more?</h2>
<p>Hear this out loudPauseIt’s not always the case. Transatlantic flights you will more often find that a flight with a layover is cheaper than a non stop flight (a direct flight can also have an intermediate stop off point).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-stopover-and-a-layover>What is the difference between a stopover and a layover?</h2>
<p>What is a Stopover? For wholly domestic itineraries, a stopover is a period of time with a transfer between aircraft of greater than 4 hours. For itineraries involving an international flight, a stopover is a period of time with a transfer between aircraft of greater than 24 hours.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-stopover-and-a-transfer>What’s the difference between a stopover and a transfer?</h2>
<p>For wholly domestic itineraries, a stopover is a period of time with a transfer between aircraft of greater than 4 hours. For itineraries involving an international flight, a stopover is a period of time with a transfer between aircraft of greater than 24 hours.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-stopover-and-a-connection>What’s the difference between a stopover and a connection?</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with a stopover. In short, this is a stop en route to your final destination. This is different than a connection, which typically is just a brief layover in an airport. Think of it as hitting pause on your itinerary.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-a-stopover-on-a-flight>How long is a stopover on a flight?</h2>
<p>Note: Due to limited flight scheduling, particularly to remote destinations, you might find layovers of greater than four hours or stopover greater than 24 hours. The definition of a layover can vary slightly between airlines.</p>
