<h2 id=why-do-some-people-lose-interest-in-a-relationship>Why do some people lose interest in a relationship?</h2>
<p>Sometimes it’s not your fault — sometimes it’s just how time passes or how people change. Sometimes it may be down to something you do, distancing yourself, or hurting the other person, which leads them to zone out of the relationship. But unless they give you a reason why, the important thing is to not be too rash if your partner looses interest.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-a-girl-lose-interest-in-me>Why does a girl lose interest in Me?</h2>
<p>If none of the above applies to you, then a woman may have lost interest simply because you met at the wrong time. None of us can surely know what is happening in the life of another. Maybe this girl already has a relationship. Maybe she has problems related to work or family, and at the moment, she can’t think about a relationship with you.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-lose-interest-in-your-spouse>When do you lose interest in your spouse?</h2>
