<h2 id=why-does-polish-not-use-the-cyrillic-alphabet>Why does Polish not use the Cyrillic alphabet?</h2>
<p>Because Cyrillic alphabet was adopted with the Orthodox christianity in Kievan Rus. Poland was baptized by the western Katholic Church which was using Latin and Lathin alphabet.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-use-a-cyrillic-alphabet>What countries use a Cyrillic alphabet?</h2>
<p>It is currently used either exclusively or as one of several alphabets for languages like Belarusian, Bulgarian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Russian, Serbian, Tajik (a dialect of Persian), Turkmen, Ukrainian, and Uzbek.</p>
<h2 id=is-cyrillic-better-for-polish>Is Cyrillic better for Polish?</h2>
<p>Granted, Polish phonology differs from that of the other Slavic languages in several ways, but these two facts remain: Polish is a completely Slavic language by any standard, and Cyrillic, unlike the Latin alphabet, was made especially to fit Cyrillic phonology, and therefore is perfectly suited for it.</p>
<h2 id=what-alphabet-do-they-use-in-poland>What alphabet do they use in Poland?</h2>
<p>Latin alphabet<br>
The Polish alphabet also abecadło is the script of the Polish language, the basis for the Polish system of orthography. It is based on the Latin alphabet but includes certain letters with diacritics: the kreska or acute accent (ć, ń, ó, ś, ź); the overdot or kropka (ż); the tail or ogonek (ą, ę); and the stroke (ł).</p>
<h2 id=is-polish-from-poland>Is Polish from Poland?</h2>
<p>Polish is a West Slavic language of the Lechitic group, written in Latin script. It is spoken primarily in Poland and serves as the native language of the Poles. There are over 50 million Polish speakers around the world – it is the sixth-most-spoken language of the European Union.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-polish-spelling-so-weird>Why is Polish spelling so weird?</h2>
<p>They are difficult to pronounce because of two reasons: Polish uses the Latin alphabet but has its own spelling/pronunciation rules. Polish uses sounds that don’t exist in English or Romance languages (but are there in Indic and most other Slavic languages)</p>
<h2 id=why-are-russian-letters-so-weird>Why are Russian letters so weird?</h2>
<p>The “backward” letters in the Cyrillic script used for writing Russian aren’t backward at all but are actually entirely different letters who simply looked up looking like letters from the Latin alphabet. In reality, the alphabet is very similar to the Latin one, and it can easily be learned in an afternoon.</p>
<h2 id=is-polish-or-russian-harder>Is Polish or Russian harder?</h2>
<p>Ranking fourth on our list of hardest languages to learn, Russian uses a Cyrillic alphabet — made up of letters both familiar and unfamiliar to us. Grammatically, Russian is not as difficult as Polish but pretty darn close. Polish has seven cases, while Russian has six.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-z-in-polish>What is Z in Polish?</h2>
<p>Ż represents the voiced retroflex fricative [ʐ], somewhat similar to the pronunciation of ⟨g⟩ in “mirage”. Ż represents common Slavic phoneme that originates from a palatalized /ɡ/ or /z/.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-cyrillic-alphabet-become-the-polish-alphabet>When did the Cyrillic alphabet become the Polish alphabet?</h2>
<p>The only time the Cyrillic was seriously considered to become Polish alphabet, it was during partitioning, at 1852. Back then, Russian tzar, Mikołaj I Romanow, planned to force Poles to adopt Cyrillic, in order to further russification of Kingdom of Poland.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-better-to-write-polish-in-latin-or-cyrillic>Is it better to write Polish in Latin or Cyrillic?</h2>
<p>Probably more likely for Russian, Bulgarian etc..to one day “go Latin”, than for Polish, Czech etc.. to “go Cyrillic”. That’s true. Even in non Roman (Latin) countries throughout the world (like Russia), there are so baby signs and billboards using the Roman alphabet because of world languages like English or Spanish.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-only-country-to-use-the-cyrillic-alphabet>Which is the only country to use the Cyrillic alphabet?</h2>
<p>Which countries use Cyrillic alphabet? Variations of the Cyrillic alphabet are used for at least 50 languages, in countries including Turkmenistan, Russia, Ukraine, Khazakstan and Belarus. The Cyrillic alphabet is used in both Slavic and non-Slavic countries, including in Turkic and Persian nations from Central Asia to Eastern Europe.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-polish--language--use-a-roman-alphabet-instead-of>Why does Polish ( language ) use a Roman alphabet instead of?</h2>
<p>Polish didn’t have there own written language, that was started to form only on the beginning of XI century with help of religion (firstly there were only translates of some praying). That is why Polish use Roman alphabet. It is so, because Poland was baptised in year 966 by Roman-Catolic church, not by Byzantine Church.</p>
