<h2 id=does-seaweed-absorb-radiation>Does seaweed absorb radiation?</h2>
<p>Seaweed actually absorbs radiation in the body, due to the presence of iodine and sodium alginate. Japan is not the only place seaweed is harvested from, other countries such as Canada, France and China harvest quality seaweed products.</p>
<h2 id=is-nori-from-japan-safe>Is Nori from Japan safe?</h2>
<p>ABSOLUTELY SAFE, probably the least radioactive food in the world because of the intense monitoring by the Japanese government before exporting food grown anywhere near Fukushima. Suggest you do in-depth search for prior Q&A. It is perfectly safe.</p>
<h2 id=is-tokyo-safe-after-fukushima>Is Tokyo safe after Fukushima?</h2>
<p>It is safe to travel to Japan as radiation levels in most parts, including Tokyo, are within the normal range of background radiation. Entry to some areas close to the Fukushima Dai-ichi NPP is restricted due to elevated radiation levels.</p>
<h2 id=is-nori-contaminated>Is Nori contaminated?</h2>
<p>CERTIFIED ORGANIC & CONTAMINANT FREE Out Nori has come out 100 percent “Non Detectable” in every single category.</p>
<h2 id=is-kelp-good-for-radiation-poisoning>Is Kelp good for radiation poisoning?</h2>
<p>Kelp also has organic iodine which will saturate the thyroid, preventing radioactive iodine from being absorbed. Miso is effective for detoxifying your body of radiation.</p>
<h2 id=is-nori-contaminated-1>Is nori contaminated?</h2>
<h2 id=why-does-nori-have-a-cancer-warning>Why does nori have a cancer warning?</h2>
<p>The British Food Standards Agency released an article today warning consumers not to eat a particular type of seaweed. Hijiki seaweed has been found to contain remarkably high levels of inorganic arsenic, a chemical element that is known to greatly increase risk of cancer.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-eat-food-imported-from-japan>Is it safe to eat food imported from Japan?</h2>
<p>The Japanese government has detected potentially dangerous levels of radiation in agricultural products from the area around the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, according to the Food and Drug Administration. And the FDA has prohibited the imports from Japan of these same foods.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-eat-seaweed-from-japan>Is it safe to eat seaweed from Japan?</h2>
<p>Seaweed products that are harvested from the Pacific Ocean area between Japan and the west coasts of USA, Canada, Hawaii and Mexico are at risk of having higher than regulated safe levels of radiation.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-radiation-is-in-japanese-seaweed>What kind of radiation is in Japanese seaweed?</h2>
<p>High radiation in Japanese seaweed was of concern since Greenpeace announced in May 2011 that it had been collecting seaweed off of Fukushima and found it loaded with radionuclides.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-radiation-to-dissipate-from-seaweed>How long does it take for radiation to dissipate from seaweed?</h2>
<p>It takes 100’s of years for radiation to dissipate. According to Greenpeace in this article written back in March 26th 2011, the radiation levels in seaweed around the Fukushima area showed 50 times higher the official limits.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-buy-nori-seaweed-in-california>Where can I buy nori seaweed in California?</h2>
<p>On April 13, 2012 EnviroReporter.com tested Nori seaweed from Japan bought in a West Los Angeles store, the same one where this reporter bought the identical item eight months ago soon after the Fukushima Daiichi meltdowns began in Japan.</p>
