<h2 id=what-is-the-rainfall-in-the-tropical-rainforest>What is the rainfall in the tropical rainforest?</h2>
<p>Rainforests receive the most rain of all of the biomes in a year! A typical year sees 2,000 to 10,000 millimeters (79 to 394 inches) of rain per year.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-tropical-rainforest-feel-like>What does the tropical rainforest feel like?</h2>
<p>It might be 80 or 90º F, but with the high humidity, you’d feel like it was much hotter. Some parts of the rainforest experience constant rain during the rainy season from December to March. The rainforest is teeming with animals and insects, so you would hear a concert of humming, thrumming, buzzing and chirping.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-climate-does-the-tropical-rainforest>What type of climate does the tropical rainforest?</h2>
<p>Climate. Tropical rainforests are defined by the fact that they are hot and wet, typical of tropical climates. Found near the equator where it is warm, these regions have rainfall year-round, with little to no dry season. The climate of the tropical rainforest biome is perfect for plant and animal growth.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-u-smell-in-a-rainforest>What would u smell in a rainforest?</h2>
<p>Another thing you’ll quickly notice during your first visit to the rainforest is the smell, which is similar to what you’d experience in a well-planted greenhouse: the combined scent of vegetation, moisture, soil, and decaying plants and wood. It’s not a bad smell — it’s the smell of life!</p>
<h2 id=what-would-you-see-in-the-rainforest>What would you see in the rainforest?</h2>
<p>birds, monkeys, frogs, and sloths, as well as lizards, snakes and many insects. Understory Layer – many vines, dense vegetation, not much light. Forest Floor – dark, damp, full of many dead leaves, twigs and dead plants. The forest floor is dark due to the trees above stopping the sunlight from entering the forest.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-weather-in-a-tropical-rainforest>How is the weather in a tropical rainforest?</h2>
<p>Weather Patterns. Tropical rainforests have an average temperature of between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius during the 12 hours of daylight. However, only approximately 2% of this daylight hits the forest floor. On average, tropical rainforests have anywhere from 1500 mm to 2500 mm of rain every year.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-climate-does-a-monsoon-rainforest-have>What kind of climate does a monsoon rainforest have?</h2>
<p>Tropical Monsoon Climate. Tropical monsoon forests have a climate similar to tropical rainforests, except for rainfall patterns. Monsoon climates are located along coastal areas, which have different air circulation patterns than those seen in a typical tropical rainforest.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-tropical-rain-forests-and-tropical-rainforests-similar>How are tropical rain forests and tropical rainforests similar?</h2>
<p>The amount of average annual precipitation is also similar between tropical monsoon forests and tropical rainforests. Monsoon forests, however, receive most of their precipitation during the peak of summer, or the monsoon season, due to changes in atmospheric circulation. John Peterson published his first article in 1992.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-wet-and-dry-seasons-in-the-rain-forest>Are there wet and dry seasons in the rain forest?</h2>
<p>Wet and Dry Seasons. Temperate rainforests have a long wet season and a short dry season. Rain still falls during the “dry” season, however, but not at the same rate as during the wet season.</p>
