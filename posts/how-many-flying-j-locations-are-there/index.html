<h2 id=how-many-flying-j-locations-are-there>How many Flying J locations are there?</h2>
<p>750 locations<br>
Pilot Flying J is the largest operator of travel centers in North America with more than 750 locations in 44 states and six Canadian provinces.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-flying-j-based>Where is Flying J based?</h2>
<p>Knoxville, Tennessee<br>
The company is based in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Pilot Corporation, the majority owner, is based. The company is owned by Pilot, FJ Management, and Berkshire Hathaway. The company operates truck stops under the Pilot Travel Centers, Flying J Travel Plaza, and Mr. Fuel brands.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-sleep-at-flying-j>Can you sleep at Flying J?</h2>
<p>Because Flying J has dedicated RV parking spaces, it’s generally not considered necessary to ask permission to park overnight there, unless all the marked RV spaces are full and you would like to park in another place, such as along the edge of the parking lot.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-shower-at-flying-j>How much is a shower at Flying J?</h2>
<p>At both locations, the shower cost $12. That’s pretty steep for a shower, but it’s also considerably less than most campgrounds with way more disgusting showers. Both Pilot Flying J and Love’s have rewards programs with a shower component.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-pilot-flying-j-scandal>What is the Pilot Flying J scandal?</h2>
<p>In April 2013, agents from the FBI and IRS raided the Knoxville headquarters of the largest truck stop chain in the United States: Pilot Flying J. It was part of a massive investigation into a fuel rebate scam. In all, 14 former Pilot employees pleaded guilty in what was known as “jacking the discount.”</p>
<h2 id=does-warren-buffett-own-pilot-flying-j>Does Warren Buffett Own Pilot Flying J?</h2>

<h2 id=do-pilots-have-dump-stations>Do pilots have dump stations?</h2>
<p>Pilot and Flying J Travel Centers are slowly remodeling their existing locations to include RV dump stations along with RV fuel lanes. Most have potable water. Go to their website and look up locations along your route. Find a location and tap on it to see what amenities are offered there.</p>
<h2 id=can-anyone-use-the-showers-at-pilot-truck-stops>Can anyone use the showers at Pilot truck stops?</h2>
<p>Can truck stop showers be used by anyone? Truckstop showers were made for truckers, but anyone can use them. It’s nice to know that you have a place to stop if you’ve been on a long trip heading into a new state or are just going on a road trip.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-you-shower-when-you-live-in-a-van>Where do you shower when you live in a van?</h2>
<p>Public and Private Campgrounds: If you’re parking at campgrounds — especially state parks and KOAs — there’s a good chance you’ll find a shower. (The AllStays app mentions whether a campground has showers.) Also, many state parks and private campgrounds allow non-campers to buy a shower for anywhere from $2-5/person.</p>
