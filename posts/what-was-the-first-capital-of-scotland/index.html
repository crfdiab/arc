<p>Perth has long been known as the “fair city” and is considered by many to be the first capital of Scotland from the 800s until 1437. In a time when the royal court moved frequently around Scotland, there was no official capital – but Perth and Kinross Council archivist Steve Connelly argues that Perth has a solid claim to the title.</p>

<p>Scone was in fact Scotland’s very first capital – not the sweet treat, the town in Perth and Kinross. It was the residence and site of inauguration of Scottish Kings and Queens for over 700 years and the Scottish Parliament was based there from its formation in 1235.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-perth-the-capital-of-scotland>Why was Perth the capital of Scotland?</h2>
<p>Perth became known as a ‘capital’ of Scotland due to the frequent residence there of the royal court. Royal Burgh status was given to the city by King William the Lion in the early 12th century.</p>
<h2 id=was-perth-ever-capital-of-scotland>Was Perth ever capital of Scotland?</h2>
<p>Perth was well established by the 12th century, a burgh (town) in 1106 and a royal burgh in 1210. Until about 1452 it served as the capital of Scotland and was therefore both a frequent royal residence and a centre of government.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-perth-the-unofficial-capital-of-scotland>Why was Perth the unofficial capital of Scotland?</h2>
<p>Perth was often the unofficial ‘capital’ of Scotland, due to the frequent residence of the royal court there. It was at Scone Abbey that the Stone of Destiny was kept, and on it the Kings of Scots were crowned, until the coronation of Alexander III (1249–86).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-edinburgh-become-the-capital-of-scotland>When did Edinburgh become the capital of Scotland?</h2>
<p>Edinburgh became the nation’s lead city in 1437 but it wasn’t the first capital of Scotland. Edinburgh took the title following the murder of King James I in Perth with the “fair city” considered by many to be the de facto capital of Scotland from the 800s until his death.</p>
