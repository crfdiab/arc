<h2 id=what-are-the-major-problems-in-ecuador>What are the major problems in Ecuador?</h2>
<p>Ecuador faces chronic human rights challenges, including weak institutions, poor prison conditions, laws that give authorities broad powers to limit judicial independence, violence against women, far-reaching restrictions on women’s and girls’ access to reproductive health care, and disregard for indigenous rights.</p>
<h2 id=how-dangerous-is-ecuador>How dangerous is Ecuador?</h2>
<p>Why is Ecuador so dangerous? Ecuador’s crime rate is very high. Drug trafficking, violent attacks, petty theft, and scams occur pretty much every day. On top of that, there’s a high risk of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-visit-ecuador-2020>Is it safe to visit Ecuador 2020?</h2>
<p>Is Ecuador safe? Ecuador is a relatively safe country, and I felt very comfortable traveling as a solo woman. That said, the US State Department discourages travel to Carchi, Sucumbíos, and Esmereldas in the north (the border region with Colombia) due to crime.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-important-environmental-problem-in-ecuador>What is the most important environmental problem in Ecuador?</h2>
<p>Due to the severity and frequency to which the Amazon is being threatened, I assert that deforestation is the most important environmental issue in Ecuador. The second most pressing threat to the ecosystems in Ecuador is water pollution and contamination that mainly affects the coast of the country.</p>
<h2 id=what-language-is-mostly-spoken-in-ecuador>What language is mostly spoken in Ecuador?</h2>
<p>Spanish<br>
Languages of Ecuador. Spanish is Ecuador’s official language of business and government, although there are dialectal differences between Sierra and Costa Spanish; Sierra Spanish has been influenced by Quichua.</p>
<h2 id=is-ecuador-a-good-place-to-live>Is Ecuador a good place to live?</h2>
<p>Wikipedia Good living, great weather and excellent medical care make Ecuador the top spot for retirees. But it is proving attractive for expats – with a cheap cost of living, good weather and top-class yet affordable health care. …</p>
<h2 id=is-the-water-safe-to-drink-in-ecuador>Is the water safe to drink in Ecuador?</h2>
<p>Drinking tap water is not advisable anywhere in Ecuador, so drink only bottled or boiled water or soft drinks.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-they-celebrate-the-carnival-in-ecuador>When do they celebrate the carnival in Ecuador?</h2>
<p>Carnival in Ecuador is celebrated in February or March each year and ends on Ash Wednesday. Ecuador has a very unique way of celebrating their carnival: they celebrate it by throwing water balloons, bags filled with flour, water weapons and anything that may make others look messy.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-things-that-are-happening-in-ecuador>What are some things that are happening in Ecuador?</h2>
<p>Provides and overview of Ecuador, including key events and facts Tests carried out on a giant tortoise found in 2019 confirm it belongs to a species believed extinct. The new president faces a divided Congress and plenty of economic challenges amid the Covid pandemic.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-they-celebrate-palm-sunday-in-ecuador>When do they celebrate Palm Sunday in Ecuador?</h2>
<p>This event is celebrated the week before Easter and starts on Palm Sunday (Domingo de Ramos). There are some parades in the streets on Good Friday, especially in Quito.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-san-pedro-festival-in-ecuador>When is the San Pedro Festival in Ecuador?</h2>
<p>The San Pedro and San Pablo festivities are held on the 29th of June each year, though they actually start the night before with bonfires in the streets. Woman wanting to become pregnant jumping over it often jump over the fires. As with all other places in the world, Christmas is celebrated in Ecuador.</p>
