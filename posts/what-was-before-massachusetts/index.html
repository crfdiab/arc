<h2 id=what-was-before-massachusetts>What was before Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>Prior to 1685 there were two separate colonies within the boundaries of present-day Massachusetts. The area around Plymouth and Cape Cod, settled by the Pilgrims, was known as Plymouth colony, or the Old Colony. The Old Colony was rapidly overshadowed by its Puritan neighbour to the north, the Massachusetts Bay Colony.</p>

<h2 id=was-maine-ever-a-part-of-massachusetts>Was Maine ever a part of Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>Maine statehood The Massachusetts General Court passed enabling legislation on June 19, 1819 separating the District of Maine from the rest of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The following month, on July 26, voters in the district approved statehood by 17,091 to 7,132.</p>

<p>Massachusetts Constitution and the Abolition of Slavery In 1780, when the Massachusetts Constitution went into effect, slavery was legal in the Commonwealth. However, during the years 1781 to 1783, in three related cases known today as “the Quock Walker case,” the Supreme Judicial Court applied the principle of judicial review to abolish slavery.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-massachusetts-before-the-civil-war>What was the history of Massachusetts before the Civil War?</h2>
