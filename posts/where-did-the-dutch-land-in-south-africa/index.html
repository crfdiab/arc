<h2 id=where-did-the-dutch-land-in-south-africa>Where did the Dutch land in South Africa?</h2>
<p>The Dutch arrival in the Cape While the Portuguese were the first Europeans to set foot in southern Africa, naming the area of Cape Town as The Cape of Good Hope, it was the Dutch who established the Cape Colony in 1652.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-dutch-to-land-in-south-africa>Who was the first Dutch to land in South Africa?</h2>
<p>Jan van Riebieeck<br>
Traders of the United East India Company (VOC), under the command of Jan van Riebieeck, were the first people to establish a European colony in South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-dutch-left-the-cape>Why the Dutch left the Cape?</h2>
<p>They were ordered to sell their produce to the company and forbidden to trade with the Khoikhoi. Thus, the settlement steadily spread from shores of Table Bay to other parts of the Cape. Tensions over loss of pastures between 1654 and 1659 resulted in open conflict in the first Khoi-Dutch war from 1659-60.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-dutch-ever-own-south-africa>Did the Dutch ever own South Africa?</h2>
<p>Increased European encroachment ultimately led to the colonisation and occupation of South Africa by the Dutch. The Cape Colony remained under Dutch rule until 1795 before it fell to the British Crown, before reverting back to Dutch Rule in 1803 and again to British occupation in 1806.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-explorer-to-visit-cape-town>Who was the first explorer to visit Cape Town?</h2>
<p>The area known today as Cape Town has no written history before it was first mentioned by Portuguese explorer Bartholomeu Dias in 1488.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-dutch-settle-in-south-africa>Where did the Dutch settle in South Africa?</h2>
<p>During his administration the town of Graaff-Reinet was founded. Kaapstad was now a town of 4,300 settlers without counting blacks and sailors. Stellenbosch was the foremost farming settlement. In 1794 the Dutch East India Company went bankrupt and in 1795 the British seized the colony.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-garden-route-george-in-south-africa>Where is Garden Route George in South Africa?</h2>
<p>The town of George is central to South Afrtican Garden Route in the Western Cape province and is the sixth oldest town in South Africa – the first founded under British rule – and was named after the reigning monarch in 1811, King George III.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-dutch-settle-on-the-cape-of-good-hope>When did the Dutch settle on the Cape of Good Hope?</h2>
<p>After their return to Holland a part of the shipwrecked tried to persuade the Dutch East India Company to open a trading center at the Cape. In 1652 a Dutch expedition of 90 Calvinist settlers under the command of Jan Van Riebeeck founded the first permanent settlement near the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
