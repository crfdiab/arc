<h2 id=what-plant-can-paralyze-you>What plant can paralyze you?</h2>
<p>Gelsemium: the plant that can cause convulsions, paralysis and asphyxia. Gelsemium comes in three flowering varieties – two native to North America and one to China. All three can be deadly. The most toxic variety of gelsemium, Gelsemium elegans, only grows in Asia, and is also known as “heartbreak grass”.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-good-to-touch-plants>Is it good to touch plants?</h2>
<p>In one study, human touch helped plants ward off a fungus. But this study found that the plants used a lot of resources to respond to touch, which are then not available for growing; the researchers found if they touched a plant multiple times, that was enough to reduce its growth rate by as much as 30%.</p>
<h2 id=what-seeds-will-kill-you>What seeds will kill you?</h2>
<p>ROSARY PEA. The rosary pea (Abrus precatorius), also known as crab’s eye or jumbie bead, is a perennial climbing vine whose small seeds are astonishingly deadly: They contain a toxic protein called abrin that is so poisonous, a single seed can kill you within 36 hours.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-plant-can-kill-you>What kind of plant can kill you?</h2>
<p>They may look harmless enough, but plants can harbor some of the most deadly poisons known. From the death of Socrates by poison hemlock to the accidental ingestion of deadly nightshade by children, poisonous plants have been responsible for human deaths throughout history.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-toxic-plant-in-the-world>Which is the most toxic plant in the world?</h2>
<p>All parts of the plant, especially its leaves, contain the toxic alkaloids nicotine and anabasine, and can be fatal if eaten. Despite its designation as a cardiac poison, nicotine from tobacco is widely consumed around the world and is both psychoactive and addictive.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-poisonous-plants-that-are-edible>Are there any poisonous plants that are edible?</h2>
<p>All parts of the plant contain the alkaloid coniine which causes stomach pains, vomiting, and progressive paralysis of the central nervous system; can be fatal. It should not be confused with the trees commonly called hemlock ( Tsuga spp.), which, while not edible, are not nearly as toxic as the herbaceous plant.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-plant-is-poisonous-to-bees>What kind of plant is poisonous to bees?</h2>
<p>An oleander’s poison is so strong, in fact, that it can poison a person who simply eats the honey made by bees that have digested oleander nectar. Despite its deadly nature, it is planted for decorative purposes. The oleander produces a lovely fragrance; however, the animals stay away.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-plants-that-can-kill-you>Are there any plants that can kill you?</h2>
<p>Even if this plant is burnt for cooking, it releases toxins that can kill humans right away. Another deadly plant is the white Snakeroot that grows extensively in North America. Though this plant is used as a treatment for snake bites, its ingestion can cause immediate death in humans.</p>
