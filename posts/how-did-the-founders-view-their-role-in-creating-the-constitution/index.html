<h2 id=how-did-the-founders-view-their-role-in-creating-the-constitution>How did the founders view their role in creating the Constitution?</h2>
<p>The Founders were ever mindful of the dangers of tyrannical government. So they built a system in which the powers of each branch would be used to check the powers of the other two branches. Additionally, each house of the legislature could check one another.</p>
<h2 id=what-role-did-the-founding-fathers-play-in-the-constitution>What role did the Founding Fathers play in the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Before becoming the the United States’ first president, George Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention, which established the nation’s Constitution. These men were responsible for forging a new nation. Collectively, they are often referred to as the Founding Fathers.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-constitution-and-why-did-the-founding-fathers-create-it>What is the Constitution and why did the Founding Fathers create it?</h2>
<p>The Constitution was written and signed in 1787. It was a charter of government that came to be ratified by the states, and it continues to be the supreme law of the land. Both documents have played an important role in American history and the spread of democratic ideals around the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-founding-fathers-create-the-constitution>Why did the founding fathers create the Constitution?</h2>
<p>The Founding Fathers often viewed their new government as an experiment, but this was an experiment they desperately wanted to succeed. Where differences arose, the Founding Fathers hammered out compromises, working together for more than four months to “form a more perfect union,” as described in the preamble to the Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-learn-about-the-four-founding-fathers>How to learn about the four founding fathers?</h2>
<p>Note: Use this lesson as a sequel to, or in conjunction with, the complementary lesson, Constitutional Convention: Four Founding Fathers You May Never Have Met. By completing the activities in both lesson, students will become familiar with the Constitutional Convention and the men and ideas that shaped the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-founding-fathers-believe-about-morality>What did the Founding Fathers believe about morality?</h2>
<p>Morality and the Founding Fathers. Although the founders’ religious beliefs differed, they formed a general consensus on morality. This consensus, however, lay with competing authorities. Most of the founders believed morality was bound to religion, but some also entertained the possibility of a secular moral framework.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-legacy-of-the-founding-fathers>What was the legacy of the founding fathers?</h2>
<p>In the end, the legacy of the Founding Fathers is the promise of liberty and justice, not only for Americans, but for any people willing to invest in democratic self-government. Before becoming the the United States’ first president, George Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention, which established the nation’s Constitution.</p>
