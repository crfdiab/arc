<h2 id=why-was-cleopatra-such-a-good-leader>Why was Cleopatra such a good leader?</h2>
<p>Cleopatra was perhaps the first woman sovereign in history to rule alone for a period of over a decade. Her leadership showed skilled use of public communication and diplomacy with which she forestalled the fall of Egypt to the Roman Empire.</p>
<h2 id=was-cleopatra-the-best-ruler>Was Cleopatra the best ruler?</h2>
<p>If Caesar had not died she could have accomplished all she wanted for herself and for her people. Cleopatra was truly one of the greatest pharaohs of Egypt. She had the makings of a great world conqueror and general, always thinking ahead, knowing her opponent, and being intelligible.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-ruler-was-cleopatra>What kind of ruler was Cleopatra?</h2>
<p>She was part of a dynasty of Macedonian rulers founded by Ptolemy, who served as general under Alexander the Great during his conquest of Egypt in 332 B.C. Well-educated and clever, Cleopatra could speak various languages and served as the dominant ruler in all three of her co-regencies.</p>
<h2 id=what-made-cleopatra-successful>What made Cleopatra successful?</h2>
<p>Although a co-regent, she commanded power in Egypt throughout her reign and kept it independent in times of political turmoil. She formed relationships and political alliances with powerful Roman generals like Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, providing them resources and finance to further their ambitions.</p>
<h2 id=what-qualities-did-cleopatra-have>What qualities did Cleopatra have?</h2>
<p>Cleopatra was charismatic and intelligent, and she used both qualities to further Egypt’s political aims. She was also ruthless, reportedly killing several family members in order to solidify her power. The only member of her house to learn Egyptian, she was said to be a popular ruler.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-cleopatra-make-a-difference>How did Cleopatra make a difference?</h2>
<p>She built up the Egyptian economy, establishing trade with many Arab nations. She was a popular ruler among the people of Egypt both because she embraced the Egyptian culture and because the country was prosperous during her rule. In 44 BC, Julius Caesar was assassinated and Cleopatra returned to Egypt.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-cleopatras-full-name>What was Cleopatra’s full name?</h2>

<p>Cleopatra, (Greek: “Famous in Her Father”) in full Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator (“Cleopatra the Father-Loving Goddess”), (born 70/69 bce—died August 30 bce, Alexandria), Egyptian queen, famous in history and drama as the lover of Julius Caesar and later as the wife of Mark Antony.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-cleopatras-contribution-to-society>What was Cleopatra’s contribution to society?</h2>
<h2 id=why-did-cleopatra-want-to-take-over-egypt>Why did Cleopatra want to take over Egypt?</h2>
<p>Cleopatra had good reason to be concerned that Rome would try to take over Egypt. She worked hard to create strong alliances with Rome’s leaders. She offered them her financial support and resources such as grain, warships and soldiers. Egypt was an extremely rich country, and Rome began to depend on its wealth.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-cleopatra-the-seventh-when-she-was-born>How old was Cleopatra the seventh when she was born?</h2>
<p>Remembering this famous woman as an evil beauty discredits her role as a wise and intelligent ruler who lived during an important period in history. CHRISTOPHER CRUISE: Cleopatra the Seventh was born over two thousand years ago in sixty-nine B.C., or sixty-nine years before the birth of Christ.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-cleopatra-related-to-the-egyptian-goddess-isis>Why was Cleopatra related to the Egyptian goddess Isis?</h2>
<p>Caesar and Cleopatra. By this point, Cleopatra had strongly identified herself with the goddess Isis, the sister-wife of Osiris and mother of Horus. (This was consistent with the ancient Egyptian tradition of associating royalty with divinity in order to reinforce the position of kings and queens.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-language-of-cleopatras-family>What was the first language of Cleopatra’s family?</h2>
<p>Her ancestors came from a long line of rulers that began with Ptolemy the First and ended with Cleopatra. This family is known as the Ptolemies. Although Cleopatra ruled Egypt, she was not Egyptian. She was Macedonian Greek. Her first language was Greek, but historians say she spoke eight others including Hebrew, Latin, Parthian and Egyptian.</p>
