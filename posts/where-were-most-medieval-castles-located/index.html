<li>Carreg Cennen Castle, Wales.</li>
<li>Predjama Castle, Slovenia.</li>
<li>Windsor Castle, England.</li>

<li>Castel del Monte, Italy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=where-were-castles-built-and-what-did-they-serve-as>Where were castles built and what did they serve as?</h2>
<p>Medieval castles were built as homes for kings and nobility, the noble class of a country such as royalty and important public figures, to protect them from unwanted intruders. Castles were typically built in the middle of the land the king or lord of the castle was ruler over.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-castles-were-built-in-medieval-times>What kind of castles were built in medieval times?</h2>
<p>The motte-and-bailey castle eventually lost its popularity, and was replaced by a new type of castle. Although motte-and-bailey castles were still being built during the 11 th century, a new type of castle, i.e. the stone keep castle, was emerging in the same century.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-castles-first-start-to-be-built>When did castles first start to be built?</h2>
<p>So how did castles originate? Fortified settlements first appeared over 2,000 years ago, where fortified towns started to appear in the Indus Valley in Egypt and also in China, where settlements were often protected by large earthen walls.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-curtain-wall-of-a-medieval-castle>How big was the curtain wall of a medieval castle?</h2>
<p>This wall was the main layer of defence, and it tended to be incredibly strong – for example, the curtain wall of Caerphilly Castle in Wales was more than 2 metres (that’s more than 6ft) thick.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-castles-made-and-how-are-they-built>How are castles made and how are they built?</h2>
<p>In the latter case, the mound could be created using earth taken from a ditch dug around the motte, or the whole castle. Some castles, like Lewes Castle and Lincoln Castle, have two mottes. The mound was topped by a tower called a keep, which was initially built of wood.</p>
