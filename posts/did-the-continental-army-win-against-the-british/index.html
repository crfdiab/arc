<h2 id=did-the-continental-army-win-against-the-british>Did the Continental Army win against the British?</h2>
<p>After French assistance helped the Continental Army force the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, the Americans had effectively won their independence, though fighting would not formally end until 1783.</p>
<h2 id=was-the-continental-army-stronger-than-the-british>Was the Continental Army stronger than the British?</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the war, British forces outnumbered Continental forces; for example, British general William Howe’s expeditionary force in 1776 numbered 32,000, compared to American general George Washington’s force of less than 20,000. Britain’s navy was the biggest and strongest in the world.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-continental-army-win>Did the Continental Army win?</h2>
<p>It was here that George Washington, the Continental Army, and their French allies secured the final great military victory of the American Revolution. As Major General and Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, George Washington won the military struggle for American Independence.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-continental-army-win-boston-or-did-the-british-lose-it>Did the Continental Army win Boston or did the British lose it?</h2>
<p>In early July 1775, General George Washington (1732-99) arrived in the Boston area to take command of the newly established Continental army. On March 17, the eight-year British occupation of Boston ended when British troops evacuated the town and sailed to the safety of Nova Scotia, a British colony in Canada.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-continental-army-ever-get-paid-after-the-revolution>Did the Continental Army ever get paid after the revolution?</h2>
<p>The Continental soldiers were not paid, or were only paid a fraction of what they were owed. Many held out for the promise of what Congress owed them, only to fall victim to speculators and soaring prices. Some were even forced into outright rebellion when they could no longer afford the very land they fought for.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-british-ever-retake-boston>Did the British ever retake Boston?</h2>
<p>The entire British expedition suffered significant casualties during a running battle back to Charlestown against an ever-growing number of militia….Boston campaign.</p>
<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>April 19, 1775–March 17, 1776</th></tr><tr><td>Location</td><td>Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td>Result</td><td>American victory British forces evacuate from Massachusetts</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-did-the-continental-army-win-the-war>Why did the Continental Army win the war?</h2>
<p>It was the Continental Army that won battles, but local militiamen performed two immensely valuable services: they secured the home-front, responding quickly to any British incursion, and they reinforced the Continentals during crucial battles.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-british-win-the-civil-war>How did the British win the Civil War?</h2>
<p>In 1780, the British captured the major southern port at Charleston, imprisoning the American garrison there, and utterly defeated a second patriot army. Before that year was out, his long-suffering troops were on the verge of mutiny and one of his senior generals had gone over to the enemy.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-continental-army-different-from-the-british-army>How was the Continental Army different from the British Army?</h2>
<p>The Continental Army and the British Army. Loading… The Continental Army and the British Army were significantly different in their organizational structure, levels of experience, and funding. The Continental Army was an undisciplined, unprepared fighting force with makeshift uniforms and sloppy tactics (at least at the beginning of the war).</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-british-army-do-in-the-revolutionary-war>What did the British Army do in the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>The British Army was the world’s elite fighting force and fresh of victory of the globe-spanning Seven Years War against France and her allies. What caused the Continental Army to prevail in the Revolutionary War?</p>
