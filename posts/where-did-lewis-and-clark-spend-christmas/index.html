<p>Fort Mandan<br>
The holiday season of 1804 was celebrated at Fort Mandan near present-day Washburn, North Dakota. On Christmas Eve, many different expedition members noted the upcoming Christmas celebration.</p>
<h2 id=what-places-did-lewis-and-clark-stop-at>What places did Lewis and Clark stop at?</h2>
<p>One year after the United States doubled its territory with the Louisiana Purchase, the Lewis and Clark expedition leaves St. Louis, Missouri, on a mission to explore the Northwest from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-lewis-and-clark-recruit-for-their-expedition>Where did Lewis and Clark recruit for their expedition?</h2>
<p>The Expedition Begins. Lewis entrusted Clark to recruit men for their “Corps of Volunteers for Northwest Discovery.” Throughout the winter of 1803-1804, Clark recruited and trained men at Camp DuBois north of St. Louis, Missouri. He chose unmarried, healthy men who were good hunters and knew survival skills.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-lewis-and-clark-pass-on-the-missouri-river>Where did Lewis and Clark Pass on the Missouri River?</h2>
<p>May 25 – The expedition passes the small village of La Charrette on the Missouri River. Charles Floyd the men was Pierre Dorion, Jr. -who knew George Rogers Clark. Lewis and Clark persuade Dorion to return to Sioux camp to act as interpreter.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-only-person-to-die-during-the-lewis-and-clark-expedition>Who was the only person to die during the Lewis and Clark Expedition?</h2>
<p>He was the only member of the Corps to die on their journey. Most of the land Lewis and Clark surveyed was already occupied by Native Americans. In fact, the Corps encountered around 50 Native American tribes including the Shoshone, the Mandan, the Minitari, the Blackfeet, the Chinook and the Sioux.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-lewis-and-clark-leave-their-children-behind>Why did Lewis and Clark leave their children behind?</h2>
<p>Previous encounters with French and British traders had infected many Indian women with syphilis, and Lewis and Clark had to treat some of their men for this disease, for which there was no cure then, only the dubious palliative of mercury pills. Old Indian traditions claim that the expedition left children behind as well.</p>
