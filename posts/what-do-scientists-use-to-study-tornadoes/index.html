<h2 id=what-do-scientists-use-to-study-tornadoes>What do scientists use to study tornadoes?</h2>
<p>Tools used to measure tornadoes include barometers, Doppler radar and “turtles.” Tornadoes are classified by the amount of damage they produce.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-study-tornadoes>How do you study tornadoes?</h2>
<p>Two ways that meteorologists research tornadoes are through field projects and with computer models. In the field projects, meteorologists get important weather observations by driving and flying around storms that produce tornadoes. This information is used by the meteorologists to create computer models of storms.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-tornadoes>What do you need to know about tornadoes?</h2>
<p>1 Tornadoes – also known as “twisters” – are violently rotating columns of air that reach from a storm cloud to the earth’s surface. 2 The winds of a tornado can reach speeds of up to 480km per hour – that’s strong enough to peel the roofs off houses, uproot trees and hurl heavy 3 Tornadoes come in different shapes and sizes.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-scientists-studying-the-path-of-tornadoes>How are scientists studying the path of tornadoes?</h2>
<p>Researchers race to place sensors in tornadoes’ paths. The sensors measure data such as wind speed, barometric pressure, humidity, and temperature. The challenge for researchers is being in the right place at the right time. Every morning they study weather conditions and head for the area that seems most likely to spawn a twister.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-tornadoes-most-likely-occur-in-the-united-states>When do tornadoes most likely occur in the United States?</h2>
<p>Tornadoes commonly occur in the daytime, as reported on the news, but night tornadoes also occur. Any time there is a severe thunderstorm, there is the potential to have a tornado. Night tornadoes can be especially dangerous because they are hard to see. Tornado Season</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-largest-tornado-research-project-in-history>What was the largest tornado research project in history?</h2>
<p>VORTEX2 was the largest tornado research project in history to explore how, when and why tornadoes form. NSSL researchers use 3-D computer models to study what changes in the environment cause a thunderstorm to produce a tornado. NSSL’s phased array radar produces high-resolution data that can be used to spot developing tornadoes.</p>
