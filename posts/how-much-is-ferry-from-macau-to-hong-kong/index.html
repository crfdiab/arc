<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-travel-from-hong-kong-to-macau>How much does it cost to travel from Hong Kong to Macau?</h2>
<p>The one-way ticket cost usually around 160 HKD and the round trip usually costs around 300 HKD. You can also buy tickets directly at any ferry terminal, however, depending on the time and terminal, you may find long queues.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-ferry-ride-from-hong-kong-to-macau>How long is the ferry ride from Hong Kong to Macau?</h2>
<p>The TurboJet takes around 50 minutes to reach Macau from Hong Kong Ferry Terminal, whereas the Cotai Water Jet takes 60 minutes. While both the ferries run every 15 minutes, i.e. from 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM and 5:30 PM to 7:00 AM, TurboJet also runs special ferries at night, peak hours, and during holidays and festivals.</p>

<h2 id=macau-taipa-ferry-terminal-is-macau-cheaper-than-hong-kong>Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal. Is Macau cheaper than Hong Kong?</h2>
<p>VERDICT: Macau is slightly cheaper (transportation, hotel, and sightseeing) but Hong Kong has a greater variety of choices for all categories. Either way, we recommend including both! Choose your own adventure and make the most of your trip to Hong Kong and Macau!</p>
<h2 id=can-hong-kongers-go-to-macau>Can Hong Kongers go to Macau?</h2>
<p>U.S. citizens who are residents of Macau, mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan are permitted to enter Macau. Residents of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan may be denied entry based on their travel history in the past 21 days.</p>
<h2 id=is-macau-expensive-to-visit>Is Macau expensive to visit?</h2>
<p>Is Macau cheap? It depends on where you’re coming from. If you’re arriving from Thailand, Vietnam and, to a lesser extent, China it’s likely to leave you with a pain in your wallet. But if you compare the city to Hong Kong, and most people do, Macau is cheap – in fact, it’s a bargain.</p>
<h2 id=are-drinks-free-in-macau-casinos>Are drinks free in Macau casinos?</h2>
<p>They do not pass out free alcohol in Macau as the casinos do in Vegas. The ladies in Macau come around with glasses of tea, not beer. It may be possible to wheedle a drink out of them, but they are not generous on that score. You’re free to enter the casino whether or not you’re staying in the hotel.</p>

<h2 id=is-food-expensive-in-macau>Is food expensive in Macau?</h2>
<p>Food from traditional stand-alone restaurants and street stalls can be quite cheap, while restaurants in the fancy hotels is anything but. Macau has its own currency, but we’ve used Hong Kong dollars here since they are essentially the same value.</p>
<h2 id=are-macau-and-macao-the-same-place>Are Macau and Macao the same place?</h2>
<p>Both spellings are correct, but in most English speaking countries, it’s “Macao”. And, in 1999, Macao became a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. Nowadays, the government of Macao officially recognises both “Macau” and “Macao” as acceptable spellings of the name.</p>
