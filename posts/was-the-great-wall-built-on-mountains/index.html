<p>Using Natural Terrain to Construct the Great Wall In fact, much of the Great Wall was constructed along the Himalayan Mountain Range, which provided a natural defense (but of course, construction on mountainous terrain was certainly not easy).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-great-wall-of-china-built-with>What was the Great Wall of China built with?</h2>
<p>Before the use of bricks, the Great Wall was mainly built from rammed earth, stones, and wood. During the Ming, however, bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall, as were materials such as tiles, lime, and stone.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-land-was-the-great-wall-built-on>What kind of land was the Great Wall built on?</h2>
<p>In flat plains, the wall was built from pounded yellow earth, layer upon layer. Besides connecting the scattered sections of previous states, Qin Wall was augmented with rather complicated military structures such as blockhouses, barriers, passes and beacon towers.</p>
<h2 id=what-mountain-range-is-the-great-wall-of-china-built-on>What mountain range is the Great Wall of China built on?</h2>
<p>Jundu Mountains<br>
Jundu Mountains (军都山; Jūndūshān) is a mountain range north of Beijing in China. Jundu Mountains represent the west part of the Yan Mountains. The Great Wall of China passes through Jundu Mountains with famous sections as Badaling.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-first-mountain-of-the-great-wall>Which is the first mountain of the Great Wall?</h2>
<p>Horn Peak is “The First Mountain of the Great Wall”, about 3 kilometers away from ancient city Shanhaiguan Pass. It is named after Jiaoshan (meaning “horn peak”), the highest peak of the north area of Shanhaiguan Pass, whose altitude reaches 519 meters.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-great-wall-of-china-made-out-of>What was the Great Wall of China made out of?</h2>
<p>While folklore has it that the mortar used to bind the stones was made from human bones or that men are buried within the Great Wall to make it stronger, it’s mortar is made from rice flour. No bones have been found in any of the construction materials. Watchtowers up to 40 feet in height were built at regular intervals.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-west-side-of-the-great-wall>Which is the west side of the Great Wall?</h2>
<p>The west side of the Wall has shallower slopes, which made it easy for soldiers to climb up to the wall to defend it. Some parts of the Great Wall on Horn peak have shallow slopes and are sinuous, but some are very steep. Jiaoshan’s major tourist spots are Big Flat Summit, Hanmen Pass, and Qixian Temple.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-great-wall-of-china>How tall is the Great Wall of China?</h2>
<p>The height of the wall ranges from 7 to 10 meters (23–33′), and the average width is 4 to 5 meters (13–16′), although at one point it narrows to just 2.7 meters (9′). There are beacon towers as well as flanking towers, and a fort included in Jiaoshan’s Great Wall section.</p>
