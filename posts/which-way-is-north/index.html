<h2 id=which-way-is-north>Which way is north?</h2>
<p>North is one of the four compass points or cardinal directions. It is the opposite of south and is perpendicular to east and west.</p>
<h2 id=is-north-always-up>Is north always up?</h2>
<p>For world maps, because we often put them on a wall, north really is up, and south is down, even though on earth those directions are both horizontal. Sometimes people print maps in other orientations so they make more sense. Having north at the top, though, is still often the easiest way to recognize where you are.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-north-side-of-my-house>Where is the north side of my house?</h2>
<p>Go to the front door of your home and open the compass app. With your phone facing forward, read the direction that the compass is measuring (this should be shown in °). The compass may also show the basic directions like North, East West and South. If the reading is between 270° and 90°, your house is north-facing.</p>
<h2 id=why-shouldnt-we-sleep-facing-north>Why shouldnt we sleep facing north?</h2>
<p>When you sleep with your head pointing north, your body’s magnetic field interferes with that of earth. This can fluctuate your blood pressure and can even cause heart problems. Sleeping with your head pointing North can also disrupt your blood circulation and lead to disturbed sleep.</p>
<h2 id=who-decided-north-up>Who decided north up?</h2>
<p>This could be because of the northwards flow of the Nile and since rivers were believed to be flowing “downwards”, they thought that “up” was South. However, Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy (90-168 AD) is known to have used a North-up approach.</p>
<h2 id=is-north-always-up-on-google-maps>Is north always up on Google Maps?</h2>
<p>Locate the north. The orientation of Google Maps is always the same when you’re browsing on a computer. North is on the top of the map, and south is on the bottom. The left will always be west, and the right is always east.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-a-north-facing-garden-bad>Why is a north facing garden bad?</h2>
<p>In a house with a north facing garden these will be dark and devoid of sunlight. North facing gardens in the summer won’t be too bad, but in the winter when the sun is low in the sky this is the worst time. You’ll find that nothing except moss and the hardiest plants and shrubs survive nearer the house.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-true-north-on-a-map>Where is the true north on a map?</h2>
<p>True North on a map is the direction of a line of longitude which converges on the North Pole.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-north-direction-on-google-maps>Where is the north direction on Google Maps?</h2>
<p>Usually North is to the top on Google maps when you are just viewing the map. You may change the orientation to show the direction your phone is pointing, too, by touching the “compass” icon. This is very useful when following directions to your destination.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-word-north-related-to-the-word-nord>How is the word north related to the word Nord?</h2>
<p>Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. The word north is related to the Old High German nord, both descending from the Proto-Indo-European unit * ner-, meaning “left; below” as north is to left when facing the rising sun.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-canada-north-of-the-united-states>Where is Canada north of the United States?</h2>
<p>Canada is north of the United States. The bottom of this map indicates Mexico. Mexico is south of the United States. The right of this map indicates the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Ocean is east of the United States The left of this map indicates the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean is west of the United States.</p>
