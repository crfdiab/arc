<h2 id=was-maria-theresa-the-last-habsburg>Was Maria Theresa the last Habsburg?</h2>
<p>Maria Theresa (1717 – 1780) was the only female ruler of the Habsburg dominions and the last of the House of Habsburg.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-prussia-beat-austria>Why did Prussia beat Austria?</h2>
<p>The issue was clear-cut: Prussia deliberately challenged Austria for the leadership of the German Confederation. The actual pretext found by Bismarck in 1866 was a dispute over the administration of Schleswig and Holstein, which Austria and Prussia had seized from Denmark in 1864 and had since held jointly.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-queen-of-austria-when-prussia-attacked>Who was the queen of Austria when Prussia attacked?</h2>
<p>Frederick II of Prussia (who became Maria Theresa’s greatest rival for most of her reign) promptly invaded and took the affluent Habsburg province of Silesia in the seven-year conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession….</p>

<h2 id=who-conquered-silesia>Who conquered Silesia?</h2>
<p>Frederick the Great: The War of Austrian Succession With an army drilled to perfection by his late father, Frederick annexed and held Silesia and invaded Bohemia with an army of 140,000. He was driven back in Bohemia, but a series of quick Austrian defeats in 1748 led to treaty negotiations.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-prussia-invaded-silesia>Why did Prussia invaded Silesia?</h2>
<p>No particular triggering event started the war. Prussia cited its centuries-old dynastic claims on parts of Silesia as a casus belli, but Realpolitik and geostrategic factors also played a role in provoking the conflict.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-prussia-and-austria-invade-denmark-in-1864>Why did Prussia and Austria invade Denmark in 1864?</h2>
<p>In November 1863, the death of the King of Denmark, Frederick VII, sparked a dispute over the succession which led to the intervention of Prussia and Austria. On 1 February 1864, the Austrian and Prussian armies invaded Denmark.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-frederick-the-great-become-king-of-prussia>When did Frederick the Great become King of Prussia?</h2>
<p>Frederick was the last Hohenzollern monarch titled King in Prussia and declared himself King of Prussia after achieving sovereignty over most historically Prussian lands in 1772. Prussia had greatly increased its territories and became a leading military power in Europe under his rule.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-ruler-of-prussia-in-1525>Who was the ruler of Prussia in 1525?</h2>
<p>List of monarchs of Prussia. The monarchs of Prussia were members of the House of Hohenzollern who were the hereditary rulers of the former German state of Prussia from its founding in 1525 as the Duchy of Prussia.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-kings-and-queens-of-prussia>Who are the kings and Queens of Prussia?</h2>
<p>List of monarchs of Prussia. The Duchy was initially a vassal of the Kingdom of Poland, as a result of the terms of the Prussian Homage whereby Albert was granted the Duchy as part of the terms of peace following the Prussian War. When the main line of Prussian Hohenzollerns died out in 1618, the Duchy passed to a different branch of the family,…</p>
