<p>Dumbarton Castle is located in the ancient capital of Scotland and is spectacularly sited on a volcanic rock overlooking the River Clyde.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-dumbarton-castle-built>Why was Dumbarton Castle built?</h2>
<p>Alexander II of Scotland built the medieval castle around 1220 as a defence against the threat from Norway, whose kings ruled the Hebrides and the islands in the Clyde. In 1305, Sir John Menteith, keeper of Dumbarton Castle, caught Sir William Wallace and handed him over to the English for trial and execution.</p>

<p>Scotland<br>
The huge rock is still there; a 240-foot-tall (73-meter-tall) volcanic basalt plug jutting from the River Clyde. Humans have long gravitated toward the storied rock. It was at the heart of the ancient Kingdom of Strathclyde, and has the longest recorded history of any stronghold in Scotland.</p>

<p>Dumbarton is a town on the River Clyde, west of Glasgow where you will find Dumbarton Castle. Founded in the fifth century, Dumbarton was once the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Strathclyde.

<h2 id=is-dumbarton-rough>Is Dumbarton rough?</h2>
<p>“Dumbarton is a brutal concrete sprawl, fulfilling every last hellish cliche about post-war planning and architecture” – so says the 1994 edition of The Rough Guide to Scotland. However the town does has some attractions, notably the castle, which is on a districtive hill like Edinburgh and Stirling castles.</p>
<h2 id=does-dumbarton-have-a-beach>Does Dumbarton have a beach?</h2>

<h2 id=did-the-earl-of-bothwell-live-in-bothwell-castle>Did the Earl of Bothwell live in Bothwell castle?</h2>
<p>He fled north, first to Orkney and Shetland, then to Denmark, where he was taken into custody by King Frederick II. In June 1573, after the collapse of Mary’s cause in Scotland, Bothwell was placed in solitary confinement in a castle at Dragsholm, where he died, insane, five years later.</p>

<h2 id=is-helensburgh-posh>Is Helensburgh posh?</h2>
<p>You still have to pay through the nose for its sparkling air; Helensburgh remains one of Scotland’s wealthiest towns, although it’s far too genteel to say so. If it were a few hundred miles south, it’d be all air kisses and poodle parlours, but that’s the sign of real wealth – discretion.</p>
