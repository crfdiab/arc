<h2 id=when-did-lord-kelvin-invent>When did Lord Kelvin invent?</h2>
<p>1848<br>
Kelvin continued to study the nature of heat. He realised that it would be useful to be able to define extremely low temperatures precisely. In 1848, he proposed an absolute temperature scale, now called ‘the Kelvin scale’.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-lord-kelvin-believe-the-earth-had-formed>How did Lord Kelvin believe the Earth had formed?</h2>
<p>Kelvin imagined the Earth to have solidified from an originally molten state, such that its initial condition was of uniformly high temperature throughout, with its surface maintained at some constant temperature thereafter.</p>
<h2 id=what-process-did-lord-kelvin-and-other-scientists-in-the-1800s-not-know-about-that-produces-heat-energy-inside-the-earth>What process did Lord Kelvin and other scientists in the 1800’s not know about that produces heat energy inside the Earth?</h2>
<p>The short answer: Convection The short answer is that the main mistake in Lord Kelvin’s estimates was convection. This was also the most popular answer in our poll with 48%, radioactivity got 44%, and 6% voted for both these elements have similar effect.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-most-of-the-water-in-our-oceans-come-from>Where did most of the water in our oceans come from?</h2>
<p>Where did Earth’s oceans come from? Astronomers have long contended that icy comets and asteroids delivered the water for them during an epoch of heavy bombardment that ended about 3.9 billion years ago. But a new study suggests that Earth supplied its own water, leaching it from the rocks that formed the planet.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-lord-kelvin-wrong>Why is Lord Kelvin wrong?</h2>
<p>This work led us to the idea that Lord Kelvin’s (William Thomson’s) estimate of the Earth’s age was wrong not because he did not account for radioactivity, as is commonly believed, but because he used the wrong model for Earth’s heat loss.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-kelvin-hot-or-cold>Is a Kelvin hot or cold?</h2>
<p>The Kelvin scale is similar to the Celsius scale. Zero degrees is defined as the freezing point of water in the Celsius system. However, the zero point in the Kelvin scale is defined as the coldest possible temperature, known as “absolute zero”.</p>
<h2 id=did-lord-kelvin-win-a-nobel-prize>Did Lord Kelvin win a Nobel Prize?</h2>
<p>The Nobel Prize in Physics 2001.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-lord-kelvin-and-what-did-he-do>Who was Lord Kelvin and what did he do?</h2>
<p>Sir William Thomson, Baron Kelvin of Largs, Lord Kelvin of Scotland (1824 – 1907) studied at Cambridge University, was a champion rower, and later became a Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Glasgow.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-image-of-lord-kelvin-in-the-public-domain>Is the image of Lord Kelvin in the public domain?</h2>
<p>This image is in the public domain in the United States because its copyright has expired. Today is the 189th anniversary of the birth of William Thomson, better known as Lord Kelvin. I don’t usually make a big deal about 189th birthdays, but I’ve been thinking a lot about Lord Kelvin recently.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-lord-kelvin-discover-the-atlantic-cable>When did Lord Kelvin discover the Atlantic cable?</h2>
<p>The first Atlantic Cable Expedition in 1857 was a failure. In 1858, the team succeeded, using an instrument called a mirror galvanometer, invented by Kelvin, to measure electric current flowing through the cable. However only a few weeks later, signals were lost and the quest had to begin again.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-kelvin-a-difficult-opponent-for-darwin>Why was Kelvin a difficult opponent for Darwin?</h2>
<p>He was enthusiastic and authoritative, and this made him an exceptionally difficult opponent for Lyell and Darwin (Hallam, 108); Darwin referred to Kelvin as his “sorest trouble” (Dalrymple, 113; Lewis, 35). The end result was that most scientists sought agreement rather than conflict with Kelvin (Lewis, 36).</p>
