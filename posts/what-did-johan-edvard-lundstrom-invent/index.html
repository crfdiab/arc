<p>safety matches<br>
Johan Edvard Lundström (1815–1888) was a Swedish industrialist and inventor who pioneered the commercial production of safety matches.</p>
<h2 id=who-invented-safety-match>Who invented safety match?</h2>
<p>John Walker<br>
In 1826, John Walker, a chemist in Stockton on Tees, discovered through lucky accident that a stick coated with chemicals burst into flame when scraped across his hearth at home. He went on to invent the first friction match.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-name-lundstrom-mean>What does the name Lundstrom mean?</h2>
<p>Swedish (Lundström): ornamental name composed of the elements lund ‘grove’ + ström ‘river’.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-match-stick>What is match stick?</h2>
<p>The head of safety matches are made of an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate, mixed with sulfur, fillers and glass powder. The side of the box contains red phosphorus, binder and powdered glass. The sulfur catches fire and ignites the wood.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-invented-matchbox>Which country invented matchbox?</h2>
<p>United Kingdom<br>
Matchbox (brand)</p>
<table><tr><th>Product type</th><th>Die-cast toy</th></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Introduced</td><td>July 9, 1953</td></tr><tr><td>Related brands</td><td>Corgi, Dinky, Hot Wheels, Husky, Lledo</td></tr><tr><td>Markets</td><td>Worldwide</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=can-eating-matches-kill-you>Can eating matches kill you?</h2>
<p>Unintentionally swallowing a few match tips is not dangerous but would be expected to cause some minor irritation to the mouth and stomach. Swallowing a large number of matches can cause serious effects including damage to red blood cells and organs such as the kidneys and liver.</p>
<h2 id=what-nationality-is-lunstrum>What nationality is lunstrum?</h2>
<p>The surname Lundstrom actually has Scandinavian roots. This is not unexpected considering that Schleswig-Holstein shares its Northern border with Denmark.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-match-heads-in-coffee>Why do people match heads in coffee?</h2>
<p>It improves the taste of (bad) coffee Only one or two ground match heads stirred into the coffee can drastically improve the taste. It works as a substitute for salt. A pinch of salt is a well-known trick among coffee lovers to enhance the flavor of the coffee while reducing bitterness.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-rarest-matchbox-car>What is the rarest Matchbox Car?</h2>
<p>1965 BP Dodge Wrecker This vintage matchbox is considered the Holy Grail of rare matchbox cars. The reverse color scheme is exceptionally rare and hard to find, and according to the Matchbox Wikia, it was a factory mistake. Almost five years ago, a similar model sold for $8,500 on eBay.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-hot-wheels-or-matchbox>Which is better Hot Wheels or Matchbox?</h2>
<p>Matchbox tends to be more focused on realism being copies of the cars and lorries (Matchbox has far more lorries than Hot Wheels) that can be seen on the roads. Hot Wheels has more fantasy elements and the cars tend to be slightly modded or hot rodded from the base car.</p>
<h2 id=does-eating-match-heads-keep-mosquitoes-away>Does eating match heads keep mosquitoes away?</h2>
<p>Does eating match heads keep mosquitoes away? Swallowing match heads will not prevent you exhaling or being warm- so no dice on mosquito repellency.</p>
<h2 id=are-match-heads-safe-to-eat>Are match heads safe to eat?</h2>
<h2 id=who-was-johan-lundstrom-and-what-did-he-do>Who was Johan Lundstrom and what did he do?</h2>
<p>Johan Edvard Lundström (1815–1888) was a Swedish industrialist and inventor who pioneered the commercial production of safety matches . Lundström was born in 1815 in the town of Jönköping, Sweden. In 1845 Lundström started to experiment with safety matches in a small workshop he had rented.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-johan-edvard-lundstrom-invent-the-safety-match>When did Johan Edvard Lundstrom invent the safety match?</h2>
<p>In 1845 Lundström started to experiment with safety matches in a small workshop he had rented. The safety match had been invented by Gustaf Erik Pasch (1788–1862) in 1844, but was difficult to produce commercially. In 1846 his younger brother Carl Frans Lundström (1823–1917) joined his small workshop.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-john-lundstram-start-his-football-career>Where did John Lundstram start his football career?</h2>
<p>Lundstram started his career in Everton ‘s academy. He signed his first professional contract in June 2011 but would never make a first-team appearance for Everton. He had loan spells at Doncaster Rovers, Yeovil Town, Leyton Orient, Blackpool and Scunthorpe United before leaving Everton to join Oxford United in 2015.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-john-lundstram-come-on-for-dave-mooney>When did John Lundstram come on for Dave Mooney?</h2>
<p>After five appearances, Lundstram extended his loan stay until after the Football League play-offs on 24 April 2014. He played in two of the club’s three play-off matches and came on as a substitute for Dave Mooney in the 108th minute of the play-off final against Rotherham United.</p>
