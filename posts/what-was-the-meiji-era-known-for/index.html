<h2 id=what-was-the-meiji-era-known-for>What was the Meiji era known for?</h2>
<p>The Meiji era was the first half of the Empire of Japan, when the Japanese people moved from being an isolated feudal society at risk of colonization by Western powers to the new paradigm of a modern, industrialized nation state and emergent great power, influenced by Western scientific, technological, philosophical.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-understand-by-the-term-meiji>What do you understand by the term Meiji?</h2>
<p>: the period of the reign (1868–1912) of Emperor Mutsuhito of Japan.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-learning-missions-in-the-early-meiji-era>What were learning missions in the early Meiji Era?</h2>
<p>They sent missions to the West, including a 50-member group headed by head of state Iwakura Tomomi in 1871–1873, to negotiate and to study institutions such as banking, schools, political systems, and treaty structures. They also dispatched young people to study in European and American educational institutions.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-during-the-meiji-era>What happened during the Meiji Era?</h2>
<p>The Meiji Restoration was a coup d’état that resulted in the dissolution of Japan’s feudal system of government and the restoration of the imperial system. They wanted to unite the country under a new, centralized government in order to strengthen their army to defend against foreign influence.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-meiji-restoration>Why is it called Meiji Restoration?</h2>
<p>In 1868 the Tokugawa shôgun (“great general”), who ruled Japan in the feudal period, lost his power and the emperor was restored to the supreme position. The emperor took the name Meiji (“enlightened rule”) as his reign name; this event was known as the Meiji Restoration.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-japan-do-during-the-meiji-period>What did Japan do during the Meiji period?</h2>
<p>During the Meiji period the government sent officials abroad to learn the structure of Western based economies. Upon their return from Europe and America, these officials recognized the need for Japan to advance industrially and technologically in order to remain self-supporting and competitive in the Western marketplace.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-emperor-meiji-when-he-became-emperor>How old was Emperor Meiji when he became emperor?</h2>
<p>—1868 Meiji Pledge. With Emperor Meiji’s ascension to the throne in 1867, Japan theoretically restored power to the emperor, but because he was only 15 years old he had little governing power. Instead, the power rested with the new government consisting of a small, close-knit cabinet of advisers.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-japanese-revolution>What was the name of the Japanese Revolution?</h2>
<p>This revolution in Japan is called the Meiji Restoration . The daimyo who brought the Meiji Emperor out from “behind the jeweled curtain” and into the political limelight probably did not anticipate all of the repercussions of their actions.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-meiji-restoration-start-and-end>When did the Meiji Restoration start and end?</h2>
<p>Responding to those pressures, the government issued a statement in 1881 promising a constitution by 1890. In 1885 a cabinet system was formed, and in 1886 work on the constitution began. Finally in 1889 the Meiji Constitution, presented as a gift from the emperor to the people, was officially promulgated.</p>
