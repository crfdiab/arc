<h2 id=are-the-andes-the-longest-chain-of-mountains-in-the-world>Are the Andes the longest chain of mountains in the world?</h2>
<p>The Andes is the longest mountain range in the world and boasts some of the highest peaks. The highest elevation in the Andes is Mount Aconcagua in Argentina, which is 22,841 feet (6,962 m) above sea level.</p>
<h2 id=which-chain-of-mountains-is-the-longest-in-the-world>Which chain of mountains is the longest in the world?</h2>
<p>The longest mountain range on Earth is called the mid-ocean ridge. Spanning 40,389 miles around the globe, it’s truly a global landmark. About 90 percent of the mid-ocean ridge system is under the ocean. This system of mountains and valleys criss-crosses the globe, resembling the stitches in a baseball.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-andes-mountain-chain>Where is the Andes mountain chain?</h2>
<p>South America<br>
Where are the Andes Mountains? The Andes Mountains line the western edge of South America, from Venezuela all the way along Chile to South America’s southern tip, crossing through Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-chain-of-mountains>Where is the chain of mountains?</h2>
<p>The Andes is 7,000 kilometres (4,350 mi) long and is often considered the world’s longest mountain system. The Alpide belt includes Indonesia and Southeast Asia, through the Himalaya, Caucasus Mountains, Balkan Mountains fold mountain range, the Alps, and ends in the Spanish mountains and the Atlas Mountains.</p>
<h2 id=what-we-call-a-chain-of-mountains>What we call a chain of mountains?</h2>
<p>A mountain chain is a row of high mountain summits, a linear sequence of interconnected or related mountains, or a contiguous ridge of mountains within a larger mountain range. While in mountain ranges, the term mountain chain is common, in hill ranges a sequence of hills tends to be referred to a ridge or hill chain.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-chain-of-undersea-mountains-called>What is a chain of undersea mountains called?</h2>
<p>Undersea mountain ranges are mountain ranges that are mostly or entirely underwater, and specifically under the surface of an ocean. If originated from current tectonic forces, they are often referred to as a mid-ocean ridge. In contrast, if formed by past above-water volcanism, they are known as a seamount chain.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-andes-mountains-located-in-the-world>Where are the Andes Mountains located in the world?</h2>
<p>The mountain range spans seven countries — Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina — and can be found between 10 degrees north and 57 degrees south latitudes and 70 degrees to 80 degrees west longitude.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-longest-mountain-chain-in-south-america>Which is the longest mountain chain in South America?</h2>
<p>The Andes. The Andes Mountains are the longest mountain chain in the world. They stretch along the entire west coast of South America from Cape Horn to Panama, a distance of 4,500 miles. Only the Himalaya Mountains and their adjacent ranges such as the Hindu Kush are higher than the Andes range. Many Andean peaks rise over 20,000 feet (6,096 m.).</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-orientation-of-the-andes-mountains-turn>Where does the orientation of the Andes Mountains turn?</h2>
<p>The Bolivian Orocline is a seaward concave bending in the coast of South America and the Andes Mountains at about 18° S. At this point, the orientation of the Andes turns from Northwest in Peru to South in Chile and Argentina.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-andes-part-of-the-american-cordillera>Is the Andes part of the American Cordillera?</h2>
<p>The Andes are also part of the American Cordillera, a chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western “backbone” of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica.</p>
