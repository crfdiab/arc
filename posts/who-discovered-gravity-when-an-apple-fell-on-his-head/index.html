<h2 id=who-discovered-gravity-when-an-apple-fell-on-his-head>Who discovered gravity when an apple fell on his head?</h2>
<p>Legend has it that Isaac Newton formulated gravitational theory in 1665 or 1666 after watching an apple fall and asking why the apple fell straight down, rather than sideways or even upward.</p>
<h2 id=was-gravity-discovered-by-an-apple>Was gravity discovered by an apple?</h2>
<p>Legend has it that a young Isaac Newton was sitting under an apple tree when he was bonked on the head by a falling piece of fruit, a 17th-century “aha moment” that prompted him to suddenly come up with his law of gravity. occasion’d by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a contemplative mood.”</p>
<h2 id=did-isaac-newton-discover-gravity>Did Isaac Newton discover gravity?</h2>
<p>Isaac Newton changed the way we understand the Universe. Revered in his own lifetime, he discovered the laws of gravity and motion and invented calculus. He helped to shape our rational world view.</p>

<p>1666<br>
The incident occurring in the late summer of 1666. In other accounts it is stated that Newton was sitting in his garden at Woolsthorpe Manor near Grantham in Lincolnshire when the incident occurred.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-an-apple-fall>Why does an apple fall?</h2>
<p>Masses do emit some kinda field called the gravitational field which has equipotentials that have perpendicular forces known as gravitational forces. And it’s these forces that causes the apples to fall on earth.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-apple-tree-that-inspired-isaac-newton-to-discover-gravity>What was the apple tree that inspired Isaac Newton to discover gravity?</h2>
<p>Apple tree that inspired Isaac Newton to discover gravity is still alive and well. Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643 in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, United Kingdom. He was an English mathematician, astronomer, and physicist widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution.</p>

<p>“Note, however, that Stukely did not claim to have witnessed the apple incident firsthand. Meanwhile, important early biographies of Newton by Pemberton, Whiston, and Colin Maclaurin include no mention of the ancedote at all. And the great German astronomer Karl Friedrich Gauss thought the story too ludicrous for words.</p>

<p>Legend has it that a young Isaac Newton was sitting under an apple tree when he was bonked on the head by a falling piece of fruit, a 17th-century “aha moment” that prompted him to suddenly come up with his law of gravity. In reality, things didn’t go down quite like that.</p>
