<p>First quarter moon the sun is RISING on that line called the lunar terminator separating lunar day from lunar night. Last quarter the sun is now SETTING at the lunar terminator. First quarter Moon is only visible at sunset on Earth. Last quarter morning is only visible in the morning.</p>

<p>Full moon signifies that the full visible surface of the moon – its day side – is fully turned toward Earth. First quarter moon means we see half of the moon’s day side (a quarter of the whole moon), and the moon is one quarter of the way through the current orbital cycle.</p>

<h2 id=when-is-the-last-quarter-of-a-full-moon>When is the last quarter of a full moon?</h2>
<p>The waning gibbous phase occurs in the middle of the full moon and the third quarter phases. The last quarter moon that we also call as the half-moon is when half of the lit area of the moon is visible after the waning gibbous phase of the moon. A waning crescent moon is when the moon is similar to the crescent.</p>
