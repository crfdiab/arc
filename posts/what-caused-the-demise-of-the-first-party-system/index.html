<h2 id=what-caused-the-demise-of-the-first-party-system>What caused the demise of the first party system?</h2>
<p>The First Party System ended during the Era of Good Feelings (1816–1824), as the Federalists shrank to a few isolated strongholds and the Democratic-Republicans lost unity.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-election-of-1856-significant>Why was the election of 1856 significant?</h2>
<p>In a three-way election, Democrat James Buchanan defeated Republican nominee John C. Frémont, and Know Nothing nominee and former President Millard Fillmore. This was the only time in U.S. history in which a political party denied renomination to the incumbent president and won.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-election-of-1860-significant-to-the-civil-war>Why was the election of 1860 significant to the Civil War?</h2>
<p>The Election of 1860 demonstrated the divisions within the United States just before the Civil War. The Constitutional Union Party was also new; 1860 was the first and only time the party ran a candidate for president. The results of the 1860 election pushed the nation into war.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-demise-of-the-whig-party>What was the demise of the Whig Party?</h2>
<p>Demise of the Whigs: 1852–1856. The election of 1852 marked the final collapse of the Whigs. The deaths of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster that year severely weakened the party, and the Compromise of 1850 fractured the Whigs along proslavery and antislavery lines.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-us-political-party-system-overdue-for-an-overhaul>Is the US political party system overdue for an overhaul?</h2>
<p>There’s reason to expect the 2020s to be a decade of major political evolution, as well. And none too soon: The United States is overdue for both an overhaul of its party system and a major renewal of its ever evolving democracy.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-realignment-of-the-political-party-system>What was the realignment of the political party system?</h2>
<p>It was founded in 1854 following the dissolution of the Whig and Free Labor Parties. Following the collapse of the Whigs during the election of 1852, a major realignment of the American political party system occurred with former Whigs splintering into various political factions.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-whig-party-do-about-slavery>What did the Whig Party do about slavery?</h2>
<p>The Whigs were unable to effectively address the slavery issue after 1850. Nearly all of their Southern members owned slaves, while the Northeastern Whigs were largely businessmen who sought national unity and a strong national market but cared little about the institution of slavery.</p>
