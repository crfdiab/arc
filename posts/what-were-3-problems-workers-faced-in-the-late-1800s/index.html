<h2 id=what-were-3-problems-workers-faced-in-the-late-1800s>What were 3 problems workers faced in the late 1800s?</h2>
<p>They did not have much money and so they lived in cramped tenements. These were unhealthy and unpleasant places. There were also problems with crime and with predatory landlords. All of these contributed to making life difficult for workers in urban America in the late 1800s.</p>
<h2 id=what-challenges-did-labor-unions-face-in-the-late-1800s-check-all-that-apply>What challenges did labor unions face in the late 1800s check all that apply?</h2>
<p>Most workers did not want to join labor unions. Skilled workers were replacing unskilled workers. Companies hired strike breakers to replace workers. The government supported business owners during strikes.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-labor-unions-have-a-better-chance-of-improving-working-conditions>Why did Labor unions have a better chance of improving working conditions?</h2>
<p>Why did labor unions have a better chance of improving working conditions than laborers did on their own? Higher wages, shorter working hours, and better working conditions were benefits.</p>
<h2 id=what-tactics-did-labor-unions-employ>What tactics did labor unions employ?</h2>
<p>The tactics available to the union include striking, picketing, and boycotting. When they go on strike, workers walk away from their jobs and refuse to return until the issue at hand has been resolved.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-labor-movement-benefit-unorganized-workers>How did the labor movement benefit unorganized workers?</h2>
<p>Thus the economic benefits of a powerful labor movement redounded to unorganized workers as well as union members. Early 20th-century unions – especially craft unions – engaged in a range of sometimes violent discriminatory practices.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-unions-change-in-the-20th-century>How did unions change in the 20th century?</h2>
<p>century had seen the birth of small crafts unions that were small and largely local. These unions were no longer sufﬁcient in an age of consolidation of American industry. Small local craft unions gave way to large national industrial unions, whose membership included workers in an entire industry irrespective of their occupation or craft.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-management-try-to-stop-the-union-movement>How did management try to stop the union movement?</h2>
<p>Of course, management attempted to shut down the growing union movement, tried to stop workers from joining unions and did whatever they could to break strikes. In many ways, the two sides were at war with one another, often with violent results.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-problem-of-labor-in-the-19th-century>What was the problem of labor in the 19th century?</h2>
<p>The proﬁt motive, in and of itself, is a good thing. Without it there is no market, no production, no employment and no goods of any value. The problem in the 19thcentury was that management, as a result of a number of factors, treated workers very badly, indeed, and saw no reason to do otherwise.</p>
