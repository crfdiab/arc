<h2 id=who-are-the-12-countries-that-own-antarctica>Who are the 12 countries that own Antarctica?</h2>
<p>On December 1, 1959, twelve nations (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Great Britain, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the United States of America and the USSR) gathered in Washington to sign the historic Antarctic Treaty. It was the middle of the Cold War, a time of global turbulence and instability.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-land-do-they-have-in-antarctica>What kind of land do they have in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Territorial claims in Antarctica include all lands and each and every ice shelf under the 60th parallel south, or it is at least how the Antarctic Treaty deals with the aforementioned claims. So, what countries are in Antarctica if any?</p>
<h2 id=why-was-antarctica-not-colonized-by-any-country>Why was Antarctica not colonized by any country?</h2>
<p>Due to the harsh climate, Antarctica was not colonized. Since no settlements were established, Antarctica remained free from land claim disputes. This unclaimed status was maintained until the early 1900s, when the United Kingdom claimed segments of Antarctica.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-countries-have-signed-the-antarctic-treaty>How many countries have signed the Antarctic Treaty?</h2>
<p>Antarctica is governed by a coalition of nations that have signed the Antarctic Treaty. Fifty-four nations have signed the Treaty. They can be divided into two groups: Consultative parties: The 29 consultative parties conduct regular scientific research in Antarctica.</p>
