<h2 id=how-much-plastic-is-dumped-in-the-ocean-each-year-2020>How much plastic is dumped in the ocean each year 2020?</h2>
<p>There are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic waste estimated to be in our oceans. 269,000 tons float, 4 billion microfibers per km² dwell below the surface. 70% of our debris sinks into the ocean’s ecosystem, 15% floats, and 15% lands on our beaches. In terms of plastic, 8.3 million tons are discarded in the sea yearly.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-plastic-will-there-be-in-2050>How much plastic will there be in 2050?</h2>
<p>Each year we produce nearly 300 million tons of plastic and by 2050 there will be more of it than fish in our oceans by weight.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-sea-turtles-die-a-year>How many sea turtles die a year?</h2>
<p>Fisheries Are Making Progress The researchers estimated that 4,600 sea turtles currently perish each year in U.S. coastal waters, but nevertheless represents a 90-percent reduction in previous death rates.”</p>
<h2 id=how-many-sea-turtles-died-in-2019>How many sea turtles died in 2019?</h2>
<p>Mortality in the Gulf de Ulloa’s marine wildlife is not new. In 2019, in addition to the 331 loggerhead turtles, 10 dolphins, 15 sea lions, 131 green sea turtles, 18 olive ridley turtles and six whales were found dead.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-plastic-is-thrown-into-the-ocean-each-year>How much plastic is thrown into the ocean each year?</h2>
<p>FACT #1. About 8 million metric tons of plastic are thrown into the ocean annually [1]. Of those, 236,000 tons are microplastics [2] – tiny pieces of broken-down plastic smaller than your little fingernail. FACT #2. There are five massive patches of plastic in the oceans around the world.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-plastic-do-we-use-a-year>How much plastic do we use a year?</h2>
<p>We make a staggering amount of plastic. In terms of plastic bags alone, we use five hundred billion worldwide annually. Over 300 million tons of plastic are produced every year, and at least 8 million of those are dumped into the oceans. 5) _____. Once you’ve seen A Plastic Ocean, you’ll realise the time is now and we all have a role to play.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-tons-of-garbage-are-dumped-in-the-ocean-each-year>How many tons of garbage are dumped in the ocean each year?</h2>
<p>That would be 155 million tons a year if present garbage management practices remain the same. Jambeck and her team combined population and economic data from 192 coastal countries bordering the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans in addition to the Black and Mediterranean Seas.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-plastic-waste-come-from-per-capita>Where does plastic waste come from per capita?</h2>
<p>The rankings in this chart reflect the largest total amounts of plastic waste flowing into the oceans annually, not the highest per capita amounts. For example, Bangladesh ranks 10th overall, with 867,879 tons, but 187th per capita, at 346 pounds per person.</p>
