<p>physicist Albert Einstein’s<br>
General relativity is physicist Albert Einstein’s understanding of how gravity affects the fabric of space-time. The theory, which Einstein published in 1915, expanded the theory of special relativity that he had published 10 years earlier.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-einstein-come-up-with-the-theory-of-relativity>How did Einstein come up with the theory of relativity?</h2>
<p>Einstein then wondered how light would behave in the accelerating room. In his four papers, published in November 1915, Einstein laid the foundation of the theory. In the third in particular he used general relativity to explain the precession of the perihelion of Mercury.</p>
<h2 id=who-disproved-the-theory-of-relativity>Who disproved the theory of relativity?</h2>
<p>Albert Einstein<br>
Newton ruled for two-and-a-half centuries before Albert Einstein turned up in 1915 to usurp him with his General Theory of Relativity. This new picture neatly explained inconsistencies in Mercury’s orbit, and was famously confirmed by observations of a solar eclipse off the coast of Africa in 1919.</p>
<h2 id=did-albert-einstein-discover-the-theory-of-relativity>Did Albert Einstein discover the theory of relativity?</h2>
<p>Albert Einstein published the theory of special relativity in 1905, building on many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained by Albert A. Michelson, Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincaré and others. Einstein developed general relativity between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-theory-of-relativity-is-wrong>Why the theory of relativity is wrong?</h2>
<p>The proving method on the theory on general relativity as requested by its founder, Albert Einstein, is not scientific and deeply wrong: In this case Einstein ignored ‘The Space and Time’ or Celestial Sphere (Celestial Coordinate System), and ignored light refraction as the fundamental concepts in astronomy. 2.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-theory-of-relativity-in-simple-words>What is the theory of relativity in simple words?</h2>
<p>What is general relativity? Essentially, it’s a theory of gravity. The basic idea is that instead of being an invisible force that attracts objects to one another, gravity is a curving or warping of space. The more massive an object, the more it warps the space around it.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-author-of-the-theory-of-relativity>Who was the author of the theory of relativity?</h2>
<p>Those were the theory of Brownian motion, the photon theory of light, and the theory of relativity. The author of these articles – an unknown person at that time, was a bureaucrat at the Patent Office in Bern, Einstein-Marity (Marity the maiden name of his wife, which by Swiss custom is added to the husband’s family name)</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-songs-in-the-theory-of-relativity>What are the songs in the theory of relativity?</h2>
<p>Through a seemingly unrelated collection of songs, scenes and monologues, The Theory of Relativity introduces a compelling array of characters experiencing the joys and heartbreaks, the liaisons and losses, the inevitability and the wonder of human connection.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-alfred-bucherer-invent-the-theory-of-relativity>When did Alfred Bucherer invent the theory of relativity?</h2>
<p>In the discussion section of the same paper, Alfred Bucherer used for the first time the expression “theory of relativity” ( German: Relativitätstheorie ). By the 1920s, the physics community understood and accepted special relativity.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-final-form-of-general-relativity-published>When was the final form of general relativity published?</h2>
<p>The final form of general relativity was published in 1916. The term “theory of relativity” was based on the expression “relative theory” ( German: Relativtheorie) used in 1906 by Planck, who emphasized how the theory uses the principle of relativity. In the discussion section of the same paper,…</p>
