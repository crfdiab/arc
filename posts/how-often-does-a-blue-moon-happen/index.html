<h2 id=how-often-does-a-blue-moon-happen>How often does a blue moon happen?</h2>
<p>How often does a blue moon happen? Normally blue moons come only about every two or three years. In 2018 unusually, we had two blue moons in one year and only two months apart – and one was a lunar eclipse! The next time we will get two blue moons in a year will be 2037.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-next-blue-moon-2020>Where is the next blue moon 2020?</h2>
<p>As of this writing, the next Blue Moon according to either definition will occur on August 22, 2021, as described in detail above. After that, we’ll have to wait a couple of years for another Blue Moon: The next calendrical Blue Moon will happen on August 30, 2023, as the second full Moon in that month.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-next-full-blue-moon-in-the-united-states>When is the next full Blue Moon in the United States?</h2>
<p>Now that the Halloween Full Blue Moon of 2020 has come and gone, the next blue moon will be a seasonal blue moon on Sunday, August 22, 2021 08:02 EST or 13:02 UTC. The next calendar blue moon is Friday, August 30, 2023 21:35 EST or August 31, 2023 02:35 UTC.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-is-there-a-blue-moon-in-a-month>How often is there a Blue Moon in a month?</h2>
<p>In the recent times, the term Blue has been applied to the second full moon within a single calendar month. Normally, there are approximately 29.5 days between full moons, hence it is quite unusual for two full moons to fit into a 30- or 31-day-long month.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-there-was-a-double-blue-moon>When was the last time there was a double Blue Moon?</h2>
<p>Double Blue Moons happen only about 3 to 5 times in a century. The next year that has two months with two Full Moons each will be 2037, while the last time this occurred was in 1999. Other combinations of Blue Moons also exist. Between 1550 and 2650 there are 20 years which have one seasonal and one Monthly Blue Moon.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-hunters-blue-moon-in-2020>When is the Hunter’s Blue Moon in 2020?</h2>
<p>The Hunter’s Blue Moon will occur on October 31, 2020—Halloween night! What is a Blue Moon, exactly? To prepare you for the Blue Moon on Halloween night this year, we’ve got all the details. In October 2020, we’re in for a special lunar event: a Blue Moon on October 31—Halloween night! But that’s not the only thing that makes this October special.</p>
