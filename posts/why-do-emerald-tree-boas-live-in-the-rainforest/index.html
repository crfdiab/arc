<h2 id=why-do-emerald-tree-boas-live-in-the-rainforest>Why do emerald tree boas live in the rainforest?</h2>
<p>More important, emerald tree boas help control the population of small mammals within their habitat, feeding primarily on rodents and small marsupials. When hunting, emerald tree boas typically hang from branches until the heat-sensing pits along their lips detect prey below.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-snake-adaptations>What are snake adaptations?</h2>
<p>A snake’s main adaptation is its very form. With no legs, arms, ears and other appendages, it can slither through grass or among rocks without causing disturbance that might frighten prey. It can enter narrow holes in the ground made by rodents, find those rodents and eat them.</p>
<h2 id=do-emerald-tree-boas-have-fangs>Do emerald tree boas have fangs?</h2>
<p>Technically, emerald tree boas don’t have fangs. “Fangs” are only used to describe sharp, pointed teeth that are connected to venom glands and emerald tree boas are non-venomous.</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-eat-emerald-tree-boas>What animals eat emerald tree boas?</h2>
<p>Predators: What Eats the Emerald Tree Boas In the wild, the emerald tree boas are usually targeted by the birds of prey. Large species of birds, primarily the Guinean crested eagles, are their foremost enemies.</p>
<h2 id=do-emerald-tree-boas-bite>Do emerald tree boas bite?</h2>
<p>Perhaps even more than for their beauty, emerald tree boas are known for their aggressive demeanor. A bite from an emerald tree boa packs a punch, as they have the largest teeth of any non-venomous snake in the world!</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-emerald-tree-boas-live>How long do emerald tree boas live?</h2>
<p>between 20 and 30 years<br>
Emerald tree boas live to between 20 and 30 years of age and reach sexual maturity in captivity between 3 and 4 years. Specifically, males can be bred as early as 3 years of age and 800g body weight; females do better at a minimum of 4 years of age and at least 1,500g body weight.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-adaptations-of-a-king-cobra>What are the adaptations of a king cobra?</h2>
<p>Physical Adaptations: Can lift 1/3 of body up and spread its hood, poison paralyzes nervous system of prey. Behavioral: Uses its tongue to smell prey to eat.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-five-adaptations-that-are-common-in-humans>What are five adaptations that are common in humans?</h2>
<p>Here are some of the amazing evolutionary adaptations that our species used to conquer the globe.</p>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-boas-live-in-the-rain-forest>What kind of boas live in the rain forest?</h2>
<p>Several tree boa species of the genus Corallus inhabit the rainforest, including at least five described species: Amazon tree boas (Corallus hortulanus), emerald tree boas (Corallus canninus), annulated tree boas (Corralus annulatus), Ruschenberger tree boas (Corallus ruschenbergerii) and Cropani’s tree boas (Corallus cropanii).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-tree-does-emerald-tree-boa-live-in>What kind of tree does emerald tree boa live in?</h2>
<p>Corallus caninus, commonly called the emerald tree boa, is a non-venomous boa species found in the rainforests of South America. Since 2009 the species Corallus batesii has been distinguished from C. caninus.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-amazon-tree-boa-adapted-to-its-habitat>How is the Amazon tree boa adapted to its habitat?</h2>
<p>Though all of the species have evolved along their own paths, they share similar adaptations, making them supremely adapted to their rainforest habitat. Amazon tree boas display a number of adaptations that are common to many arboreal species.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-camouflage-does-a-tree-boa-use>What kind of camouflage does a tree boa use?</h2>
<p>Cryptic coloration, also known as camouflage, is an important aspect of survival for tree boas. Emerald tree boas are perhaps the best example in the group, as their green coloration makes them all but invisible in the jungle canopy.</p>
