<h2 id=why-is-ti-83-so-expensive>Why is TI-83 so expensive?</h2>
<p>Technology has not yet killed the reliable old TI-83. Nearly 20 years later, students are still forced to use a prohibitively expensive piece of outdated technology. It’s because Texas Instruments, the company that creates them, has a staggering monopoly in the field of high school mathematics.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-graphing-calculator-worth-it>Is a graphing calculator worth it?</h2>
<p>A graphing calculator is indispensable. You’ll need it for Algebra and Geometry, and they last long. So even if you don’t need one now, you’ll have it at hand for the future. Yes, I would recommend it, if you are planning to go advanced math and science.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-easiest-graphing-calculator-to-use>What is the easiest graphing calculator to use?</h2>
<p>List of the Best Graphing Calculators</p>
<ul>
<li>TI-83 Plus – Best Simple Graphing Calculator for Beginners.</li>
<li>TI-84 Plus CE – Fantastic Choice for College Students.</li>
<li>TI-89 Titanium – Best Suited for Advanced Users.</li>
<li>Casio FX-CG10 PRIZM – Best Value Calculator for High School Students.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-are-cas-calculators-so-expensive>Why are CAS calculators so expensive?</h2>
<p>What gives? It’s all about supply and demand. Graphing calculators are still widely used by students, and schools have strict boundaries for what these gadgets can do. Many curriculums in American math classes require the use of a TI-83 or TI-84 graphing calculator (or its equivalent).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-graphing-calculator-so-expensive>Why is graphing calculator so expensive?</h2>
<p>Plastic case, small black and white screen, two semiconductor chips. The batteries are even not rechargeable like a cell phone.” Curtis estimated that each calculator costs about $15-20 to make. Due to the high market price caused by high demand, he guesses that the company can boast a profit margin of over 50 percent.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-the-ti-83>How old is the TI 83?</h2>
<p>The original TI-83 is itself an upgraded version of the TI-82. Released in 1996, it was one of the most popular graphing calculators for students.</p>
<h2 id=do-schools-still-use-graphing-calculators>Do schools still use graphing calculators?</h2>
<p>Yet, for millions of middle school and high school students around America, the graphing calculator is still a required standard — and TI controls an estimated 80% of the $300m+ market. An obsolete piece of technology has managed to maintain a stranglehold on an increasingly tech-savvy education market.</p>
<h2 id=do-engineering-students-need-graphing-calculator>Do engineering students need graphing calculator?</h2>
<p>As an engineering student, sometimes I found such calculators to be enormously useful, but in other cases they can be unnecessary or even hinder learning. Their list of approved calculators includes scientific—but not graphing—calculators from Hewlett Packard (HP), Casio, and Texas Instruments (TI).</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-ti-84-or-89>Which is better ti 84 or 89?</h2>
<p>Main Difference of TI 84 Plus and TI 89 Titanium One other main difference between these two calculators is that the TI-89 can solve more equations and is much more powerful. The TI-89 is a Computer Algebra System (CAS) which allows it to factor polynomials, take derivatives, solve integrals, and much more.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-graphing-calculator-to-buy>Which is the best graphing calculator to buy?</h2>
<p>Physical graphing calculators are a big investment, and often a really good one. If you’re serious about your graphing calculator needs, and know you need a high-powered device to take with you to class, exams, or work, this mini-computer is an important part of your life.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-graphing-calculator-on-your-phone>Do you need a graphing calculator on your phone?</h2>
<p>Simply put, the one on your phone just isn’t going to cut it, plus you won’t be allowed to take that into exams with you. Instead, you’ll need a graphing calculator. We’ve done the hard part for you – scouring the market for some of the best graphing calculators around, in the hopes that we can help you find one that you like.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-switch-between-graphing-calculators>How do you switch between graphing calculators?</h2>
<p>You can switch between calculators using the tabs on the top, and each calculator also separates functions using tabs. So for example, the graphing calculator toggles between the equations, tables, intersections, and plot points. It makes it easy to organize and keep track of your work.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-fx-9750gii-a-good-graphing-calculator>Is the fx-9750GII a good graphing calculator?</h2>
<p>The fx-9750GII can connect to your computer using a USB cable, which allows you to backup your data. You can also attach it to a second calculator and share your results with it – a transfer cable is included, but the USB cable is not, so you’ll have to locate one of those yourself.</p>
