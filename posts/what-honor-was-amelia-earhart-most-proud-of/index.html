<h2 id=why-was-amelia-earhart-awarded-the-distinguished-flying-cross>Why was Amelia Earhart awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross?</h2>
<p>Upon returning to the United States, Congress awarded her the Distinguished Flying Cross—a military decoration awarded for “heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight.” She was the first woman to receive the honor. Later that year, Earhart made the first solo, nonstop flight across the United States by a woman.</p>

<p>The two were last seen in Lae, New Guinea, on July 2, 1937, on the last land stop before Howland Island and one of their final legs of the flight.

Nearly one year and six months after she and Noonan disappeared, Earhart was officially declared dead.</p>
