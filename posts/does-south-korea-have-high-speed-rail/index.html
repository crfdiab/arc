<h2 id=does-south-korea-have-high-speed-rail>Does South Korea have high speed rail?</h2>
<p>High-speed rail service in South Korea began with the construction of a high-speed line from Seoul to Busan in 1992. The first commercial high-speed rail service was launched on April 1, 2004. Currently, South Korea hosts two high-speed rail operators: Korea Train eXpress (KTX) and Super Rapid Train (SRT).</p>
<h2 id=does-south-korea-have-trains>Does South Korea have trains?</h2>
<p>South Korea has bullet trains called KTX (Korea Train Express). There are 2 types of KTX trains: KTX-I (KTX) and KTX-II, that was renamed to KTX-Sancheon. The KTX Sancheon trains have better wider 1st class seats than KTX.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trains-are-there-in-south-korea>How many trains are there in South Korea?</h2>
<p>Korean Railway Stations There are around 638 train stations in South Korea.</p>
<h2 id=can-we-go-korea-by-train>Can we go Korea by train?</h2>
<p>With A-Train, or Jeongseon Arirang A-Train, you can travel through Jeongseon Country in Gangwon Province, the northeastern region of Korea. The ‘A’ in the name comes from “Arirang (a Korean folk song)”, “amazement” and “adventure”.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-railway-company-in-south-korea>Is there a railway company in South Korea?</h2>
<p>Korean rail is mainly operated by government-owned corporation Korail, but there are several high-speed lines which are owned and managed by private companies. South Korean railways are highly integrated into subway systems of the biggest Korean cities.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-trains-in-north-and-south-korea>Are there trains in North and South Korea?</h2>
<p>South Korean railways are highly integrated into subway systems of the biggest Korean cities. That makes transportation of passengers more convenient while using the most logical conjunctions. In December 26, 2018, after long preparations, South and North Korean Railway systems were re-connected.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-train-in-south-korea>When was the first train in South Korea?</h2>
<p>First trains began to service passengers in 1899. They connected Jemulpo with Han River near Yeongdeungpo. The major lines were later laid during the Japanese rule of Korea. The railway system of South Korea was even attached to the Trans-Siberian Railway but was hardly damaged during the Korean War.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-transportation-system-in-south-korea>How is the transportation system in South Korea?</h2>
<p>The Subway system was built in Seoul, the highway network was expanded by 487 km and major port projects were started in Pohang, Ulsan, Masan, Incheon and Busan. The railroad network experienced improvements in the 1980s with electrification and additional track projects. Operation speed was also increased on the main lines.</p>
