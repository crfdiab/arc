<h2 id=why-papyrus-is-called-gift-of-the-nile>Why papyrus is called Gift of the Nile?</h2>
<p>The Nile is shaped like a lotus flower, the design seen in ancient Egyptian art, math, and hieroglyphics. The ancient Egyptians called this soil the “The Gift of the Nile”. The Nile provided other gifts to the ancient Egyptians. Papyrus, used for everything, grew wildly along its banks.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-egypt-the-gift-of-the-nile>How was Egypt the gift of the Nile?</h2>
<p>a. Assignment #1: “Egypt is wholly the gift of the Nile,” means that the Nile River made civilization in Egypt possible. It provided the people with means for transport, help with irrigation for farming, some food such as fish, and even created fertile soil for growing crops.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-5-gifts-of-the-nile-river>What are the 5 Gifts of the Nile River?</h2>
<p>Gifts of the Nile included water, transportation, trade, papyrus, fish and other animals, and rich black soil. It all started each year with the annual slow flooding of the Nile. The annual flood is often called the inundation.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-ancient-egypt-landscape-look-like>What did Ancient Egypt landscape look like?</h2>
<p>Three different geographic features in Ancient Egypt are the Desert, the Delta, and the Fertile Land. The desert was a barren place full of sand dunes, mountains, and cliffs. The desert was a dangerous place and therefore acted as a natural barrier between ancient Egypt and invading foreign armies.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-papyrus-help-the-people-of-ancient-egypt>How did papyrus help the people of ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>How did papyrus help ancient Egypt? It was used to make everything! The ancient Egyptians used papyrus to make paper, baskets, sandals, mats, rope, blankets, tables, chairs, mattresses, medicine, perfume, food, and clothes. Truly, papyrus was an important “gift of the Nile”. The ancient Egyptians soaked papyrus to soften it, and then mashed it.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-was-the-papyrus-plant-in-ancient-egypt>How tall was the papyrus plant in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Papyrus (Cyperus papyrus) is a plant, which was once abundant in the Egyptian Delta. Today it is quite rare in the wild. Ancient Egyptians discovered a way to domesticate the 5 meters (16 feet) tall papyrus stalks in farms.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-ancient-egyptians-call-the-gift-of-the-nile>What did the ancient Egyptians call the gift of the Nile?</h2>
<p>The ancient Egyptians called that black soil the “the Gift of the Nile.” During November and December the land near the riverbank was dry enough to plant crops in the rich black soil. By March and April crops were green and ready to harvest.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-was-a-book-made-of-papyrus>How long was a book made of papyrus?</h2>
<p>Someone one end, and sometimes both ends were fastened to a stick of wood, or if you were very rich, a thin stick of ivory. Most papyrus books were only a few feet long. But some were very long, over 150 feet long! But still, it was paper made of papyrus.</p>
