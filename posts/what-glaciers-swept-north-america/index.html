<h2 id=what-glaciers-swept-north-america>What glaciers swept North America?</h2>
<p>Laurentide Ice Sheet, principal glacial cover of North America during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago). At its maximum extent it spread as far south as latitude 37° N and covered an area of more than 13,000,000 square km (5,000,000 square miles).</p>
<h2 id=where-are-piedmont-glaciers-found-of-north-america>Where are piedmont glaciers found of North America?</h2>
<p>But the largest piedmont glacier in North America (and possibly the world) is Malaspina in southeastern Alaska.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-glacier-in-the-united-states>When was the last glacier in the United States?</h2>
<p>The Pinedale (central Rocky Mountains) or Fraser (Cordilleran Ice Sheet) glaciation was the last of the major glaciations to appear in the Rocky Mountains in the United States. The Pinedale lasted from approximately 30,000 to 10,000 years ago and was at its greatest extent between 23,500 and 21,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-glaciers-melt-left-behind>When did the glaciers melt left behind?</h2>
<p>When glaciers began their final retreat 10,000 years ago, they left behind many landscape features, such as lakes, valleys, and mountains. Many hollowed-out areas carved by glaciers became lakes. Bowl-shaped cirques, where most alpine glaciers form, became mountain lakes. These alpine lakes are called tarns.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-piedmont-glacier-in-the-world>Which is the largest piedmont glacier in the world?</h2>
<p>Malaspina Glacier<br>
The Malaspina Glacier is one of the most famous examples of this type of glacier, and is the largest piedmont glacier in the world. Spilling out of the Seward Ice Field (visible near the top of the photograph), it covers over 5,000 square kilometers as it spreads across the coastal plain.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-longest-glacier-in-the-united-states>What is the longest glacier in the United States?</h2>
<p>Bering Glacier<br>
The largest glacier in the United States is the Bering Glacier, near Cordova, Alaska.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-not-evidence-that-glaciers-were-much-bigger-about-20000-years-ago-than-they-are-now>Which is not evidence that glaciers were much bigger about 20000 years ago than they are now?</h2>
<p>Which is not evidence that glaciers were much bigger about 20,000 years ago than they are now? Shells of creatures that lived in the ocean about 20,000 years ago indicate that the ocean water was especially isotopically light then.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-malaspina-glacier-in-alaska-located>Where is the Malaspina Glacier in Alaska located?</h2>
<p>It is located in Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve, which with Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve (Alaska, U.S.), Kluane National Park and Reserve (Yukon, Canada), and Tatshenshini-Alsek National Park (British Columbia, Canada) constitutes a World Heritage site.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-glacial-period-in-the-northern-hemisphere>When was the last glacial period in the northern hemisphere?</h2>
<p>Other areas of the Northern Hemisphere did not bear extensive ice sheets, but local glaciers in high areas. Parts of Taiwan, for example, were repeatedly glaciated between 42,250 and 8,680 BC as well as the Japanese Alps. In both areas maximum glacier advance occurred between 58,000 and 28,000 BC.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-glacier-outside-the-ice-cap>Which is the largest glacier outside the ice cap?</h2>
<p>The largest piedmont glacier in North America and one of the largest outside the ice cap regions of the world. Malaspina Glacier, located primarily within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, is the largest piedmont glacier in North America and one of the largest outside the ice cap regions of the world.</p>
