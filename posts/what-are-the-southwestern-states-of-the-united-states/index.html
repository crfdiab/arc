<h2 id=what-are-the-southwestern-states-of-the-united-states>What are the southwestern states of the United States?</h2>
<p>The southwestern United States, also known as the American Southwest or simply the Southwest, is a geographic and cultural region of the United States that generally includes Arizona, New Mexico, and adjacent portions of California, Colorado, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-california-become-part-of-the-united-states>Why did California become part of the United States?</h2>
<p>Why did California became a state? In 1849, Californians sought statehood and, after heated debate in the U.S. Congress arising out of the slavery issue, California entered the Union as a free, nonslavery state by the Compromise of 1850.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-people-first-come-to-the-southwest>When did people first come to the southwest?</h2>
<p>Long before the appearance of the first Spanish explorers in the 1500s, the Southwest was inhabited by a variety of native populations. Groups of hunters walked here across the Bering Straits over a land bridge that once joined Asia with North America; estimates of when that occurred range from 15,000 to 35,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-spanish-divide-california-into-two-parts>Where did the Spanish divide California into two parts?</h2>
<p>The Spanish divided California into two parts, Baja California and Alta California, as provinces of New Spain (Mexico). Baja or lower California consisted of the Baja Peninsula and terminated roughly at San Diego, California, where Alta California started.</p>

<h2 id=what-are-the-countries-that-border-the-united-states>What are the countries that border the United States?</h2>
<p>International border states are shown in red on this map. Florida shares a water border with Cuba. The international border states are those states in the U.S. that border either Canada, Mexico, Cuba, or Russia.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-only-state-that-shares-its-borders-with-six-other-states>Which is the only state that shares its borders with six other states?</h2>
<p>Assam is the only state among the seven sisters which shares its borders with the rest of the six states that comprise the seven sisters. Each of the states of Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka share their borders with six neighboring states.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-gain-control-of-the-southwest>How did the US gain control of the southwest?</h2>
<p>The United States, undergoing a period of expansion, annexed the Republic of Texas, which initiated a war with Mexico for control of much of the Southwest. After the war between the U.S. and Mexico (1846-1848), the U.S. negotiated to receive lands that became the states we know as New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado.</p>

<h2 id=where-does-southwest-airlines-fly-to-in-mexico>Where does Southwest Airlines fly to in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Mexico is calling by way of the Caribbean. Lovers of ecotourism, rejoice: Southwest flies to the island of Cozumel, a popular destination for lovers of sun, surf, flora, and fauna. When you deplane at Cozumel International Airport, it’ll only be a matter of time before you find yourself drawn to the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-states-that-used-to-be-part-of-mexico>What are the states that used to be part of Mexico?</h2>
<p>Like California, it became part of the U.S. with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Before then, Nevada was part of Alta California, which included California, Baja California, Utah, about a quarter of Colorado, parts of Arizona, Wyoming and New Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-state-of-oklahoma-still-part-of-mexico>Is the state of Oklahoma still part of Mexico?</h2>
<p>Oklahoma, too, was once Mexican territory. Like Kansas, a part of Oklahoma was included in the Louisiana Purchase (1803), while its panhandle was under Mexican rule until the United States received it in 1848.</p>
