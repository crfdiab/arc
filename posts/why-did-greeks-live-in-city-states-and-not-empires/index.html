<h2 id=why-did-greeks-live-in-city-states-and-not-empires>Why did Greeks live in city-states and not empires?</h2>
<p>One major reason why ancient Greece was dominated by small city-states and independent towns, rather than by one all-powerful king, is its geography. A final reason behind the development of city-states was the Greek aristocracy, who acted to prevent any permanent monarchies from forming.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-all-the-greek-city-states-have-in-common>Why did all the Greek city-states have in common?</h2>
<p>All Greek city-states used the same language, honored the same ancient heroes, participated in common festivals, prayed to the same gods. Their similarities were, all citizens were men, they believed in the same gods, men received military training, and they were both located in the Aegean region.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-many-greek-city-states-build-walls-around-their-cities>Why did many Greek city-states build walls around their cities?</h2>
<p>Fortification walls served multiple purposes for the Greeks. They served as a means of protection from invasion and as markers of territory. Walls were first constructed around the city’s Acropolis, to ensure the safety of the most important part of Greek society—their sacred space.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-the-greek-city-states>What was the role of the Greek city states?</h2>
<p>Greek City-States. The Greek city-states were the dominant settlement structure of the ancient Greek world and helped define how different regions interacted with each other.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-greek-americans-live-in-the-united-states>Where do Greek Americans live in the United States?</h2>
<p>Greek Americans have the highest concentrations in the New York City, Boston, and Chicago regions, but have settled in major metropolitan areas across the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-country-in-ancient-greece>What was the name of the country in ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>There was never one country called ‘ancient Greece’. Instead, Greece was divided up into small city-states, like Athens, Sparta, Corinth and Olympia. Each city-state ruled itself. They had their own governments, laws and army. So, ancient Greeks living in Sparta considered themselves Spartan first, and Greek second.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-ancient-greeks-do-for-a-living>What did the ancient Greeks do for a living?</h2>
<p>About 2,500 years ago, Greece was one of the most important places in the ancient world. The Greeks were great thinkers, warriors, writers, actors, athletes, artists, architects and politicians. The Greeks called themselves Hellenes and their land was Hellas.</p>
