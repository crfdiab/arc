<h2 id=what-is-causing-ice-to-melt>What is causing ice to melt?</h2>
<p>Water that is under the ice and that has a temperature above the freezing point causes the bottom surface of the ice to melt. Warm surface waters cause the edges of the ice to melt, particularly in leads and polynyas.</p>
<h2 id=is-ice-melting-natural>Is ice melting natural?</h2>
<p>Based on that cycle, they conclude that 30 percent to 50 percent of the melting is due to natural causes, while human-caused warming is responsible for the rest. Climate scientists have always acknowledged a natural cause for shifts in the rate of Arctic melting.</p>
<h2 id=what-will-happen-if-the-ice-sheets-melt>What will happen if the ice sheets melt?</h2>
<p>If all the ice covering Antarctica , Greenland, and in mountain glaciers around the world were to melt, sea level would rise about 70 meters (230 feet). The ocean would cover all the coastal cities. And land area would shrink significantly. Ice actually flows down valleys like rivers of water .</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-sea-ice-as-it-melts>What happens to sea ice as it melts?</h2>
<p>“As the sea ice shrinks, more solar energy is being absorbed by the oceans and atmosphere, causing the Arctic to warm faster than anywhere else on the planet,” she continued. “Not only is this speeding up sea ice melt, it’s also exacerbating the melting of glaciers and ice sheets which causes sea levels to rise.”</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-people-when-ice-sheets-melt>What happens to people when ice sheets melt?</h2>
<p>As these ice sheets melt and glaciers retreat, people and animals around the world “at both local and global scales” are at risk, according to report co-author Inès Otosaka. On a global scale, when sea level rise gets out of hand, coastal areas experience high flood risks.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-ice-is-melting-in-the-world>How much ice is melting in the world?</h2>
<p>According to the study, ice melt over the past three decades has steadily increased — in the 1990s, there was an average global ice melt of 0.8 trillion tonnes per year; by 2017, there was an average of 1.3 trillion tonnes per year. In total, the rate of ice loss has increased by 65 percent between 1994 and 2017.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-greenlands-ice-melting-affecting-the-world>How is Greenland’s ice melting affecting the world?</h2>
<p>Warmer air temperatures around Greenland are directly melting its ice, as well as causing ice to calve off into the ocean. Greenland holds enough ice to raise global sea levels as much as 23 feet and other NASA studies have found melting is accelerating.</p>
