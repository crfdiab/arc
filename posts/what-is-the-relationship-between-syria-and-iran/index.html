<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-syria-and-iran>What is the relationship between Syria and Iran?</h2>
<p>Syria and Iran are strategic allies. Syria is usually called Iran’s “closest ally”, with ideological conflict between the Arab nationalism ideology of Syria’s secular ruling Ba’ath Party and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s pan-Islamist policy notwithstanding.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-crisis-in-syria-all-about>What is the crisis in Syria all about?</h2>
<p>The Syrian refugee crisis is the humanitarian emergency resulting from the Syrian civil war that began March 15, 2011. Conflict in Syria has exacted a heavy toll on hundreds of thousands of children and their families. It’s also a protracted emergency, which is ongoing for five years or more.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-syrian-war-over>Is the Syrian war over?</h2>
<p>Over the course of the war, a number of peace initiatives have been launched, including the March 2017 Geneva peace talks on Syria led by the United Nations, but fighting has continued….Military situation in February 2021:</p>
<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>15 March 2011 – present (10 years, 4 months, 4 weeks and 2 days)</th></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td>Ongoing</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-reason-of-syrian-war>What is the main reason of Syrian war?</h2>
<p>The war started in 2011, when Syrians enraged by corruption and emboldened by a wave of “Arab Spring” protests across the region took to the streets to demand democratic accountability for their leaders.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-situation-in-syria-at-the-moment>What’s the situation in Syria at the moment?</h2>
<p>Backed by Russia and Shiite Muslim militias supported by Iran, the Syrian troops have steadily gained on one of the few pockets of control remaining from the 2011 uprising against Assad. “What is happening at present is biting and taking some villages from the eastern side,” a Syrian military commander told Reuters.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-israel-and-iran-fighting-in-syria>Why are Israel and Iran fighting in Syria?</h2>
<p>Israel has watched anxiously as its neighbour Syria has been consumed by war since 2011. Why is there a war in Syria? Israel has stayed out of the fighting between the Syrian government and rebels. But Iran has played a bigger and bigger role backing Syria’s government by sending thousands of fighters and military advisers.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-israel-do-to-iran-in-2019>What did Israel do to Iran in 2019?</h2>
<p>Israel has accused Iran and these allies of Tehran of entrenching in Syria and moving Iranian weapons via Iraq to Syria and Lebanon. Israel’s former chief of staff Gadi Eizenkot said in January 2019 that Israel had conducted more than 1,000 airstrikes in Syria against Iranian targets.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-conflict-in-syria-an-internal-issue>Is the conflict in Syria an internal issue?</h2>
<p>What is happening in Syria is not an internal issue, but a conflict between the axis of resistance and its enemies in the region and the world. Iran will not tolerate, in any form, the breaking of the axis of resistance, of which Syria is an intrinsic part.</p>
