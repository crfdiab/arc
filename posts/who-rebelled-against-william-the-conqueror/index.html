<h2 id=who-rebelled-against-william-the-conqueror>Who rebelled against William the Conqueror?</h2>
<p>Hereward the Wake<br>
Hereward the Wake, (flourished 1070–71), Anglo-Saxon rebel against William the Conqueror and the hero of many Norman and English legends.</p>
<h2 id=what-rebellions-were-there-against-william>What rebellions were there against William?</h2>
<p>The first, Morcar was replaced in 1066 and the two earls that followed him were murdered. Cospatrick, an Anglo-Saxon, paid William to become earl but he quickly changed sides and became involved in the rebellion against William across the north which was led by the Edwin of Mercia, Morcar and Edgar Atheling.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-there-rebellions-against-william>Why were there rebellions against William?</h2>
<p>So what was it about William and the Normans that led the English to keep rebelling? One major reason was that, after the Norman conquest, William had an army of 7,000 or so men at his back who were hungry for reward in the form of land.</p>
<h2 id=who-betrayed-the-other-earls-in-1075>Who betrayed the other earls in 1075?</h2>
<p>They were betrayed by their co-conspirator Earl Waltheof of Northumbria when he revealed the whole plan to King William. Norman barons loyal to the king defeated Ralph in East Anglia and forced him to escape abroad.</p>
<h2 id=was-hereward-the-wake-a-real-person>Was Hereward the Wake a real person?</h2>
<p>wəd/) ( c. 1035 – c. 1072) (also known as Hereward the Outlaw or Hereward the Exile) was an Anglo-Saxon nobleman and a leader of local resistance to the Norman Conquest of England. His base, when leading the rebellion against the Norman rulers, was the Isle of Ely in eastern England.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-3-marcher-earldoms-called>What were the 3 Marcher Earldoms called?</h2>
<p>William wanted to make the border between England and Wales more secure. He established the Marcher earldoms – three new earldoms centred on Hereford, Shrewsbury and Chester. (March was an Anglo-Saxon term for border). All three earldoms were given as rewards to people who had been loyal to William.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-herewards-nickname>What was Hereward’s nickname?</h2>
<p>The epithet “the Wake”, first recorded in the 14th century, may mean “the watchful”, or derive from the Anglo-Norman Wake family who later claimed descent from him.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-rebellion-in-1069>Who was the leader of the rebellion in 1069?</h2>
<p>The Harrying of the North in response to rebellion Some English people rebelled against William including Hereward the Wake in East Anglia and Eadric the Wild in Shropshire. The biggest rebellion was in the north of England in 1069. It was led by Edgar the Atheling who, as the only son of Edward the Exiled, had a blood-claim to the throne.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-roger-lead-a-revolt-against-william>Why did Roger lead a revolt against William?</h2>
<p>But Roger led a rebellion against his William that threatened to destroy the peace he had fought so hard for. Why did Roger lead a rebellion? By 1074 Roger was increasingly unhappy with the amount of power he had.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-william-go-north-to-quell-the-rebellion>Why did William go north to quell the rebellion?</h2>
<p>The Harrying was William’s third trip to the north in as many years. He went north the first time in 1068 to quell a rebellion in York. While there he founded York Castle, as well as half a dozen other castles, and the English submitted. The remains of Baile Hill, believed to be the second motte-and-bailey castle built by William in York.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-resistance-against-the-normans>Who was involved in the resistance against the Normans?</h2>
<p>Hereward fought a guerrilla war against the Normans until King William captured his base on the Isle of Ely. Hereward was pardoned by William but Morcar, who came to support Hereward, was imprisoned for life.</p>
