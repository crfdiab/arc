<h2 id=what-were-some-of-the-occupations-of-the-first-settlers-of-georgia>What were some of the occupations of the first settlers of Georgia?</h2>
<p>Silkmakers, merchants, carpenters, etc.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-earn-a-living-in-colonial-georgia>How did people earn a living in colonial Georgia?</h2>
<p>People in colonial Georgia and the other Southern colonies made a living exporting tobacco, furs, indigo, rice and farm products. Colonial work was generally related to agriculture and farming, with top exports including vegetables, fruit, cotton and livestock. Georgia was founded as one of the original 13 colonies.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-common-jobs-in-the-1700s>What were common jobs in the 1700s?</h2>
<p>The most prevalent jobs in the 1700s were in agriculture and farming. In addition, there were many skilled craftsmen and artisans, which included candlemakers, gunsmiths, brickmakers, blacksmiths, cobblers and hatters. These jobs arose out of a growing demand for household goods.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-work-life-like-in-colonial-times>What was work life like in Colonial times?</h2>
<p>Much of colonial life was hard work, even preparing food. But colonists found ways to mix work with play. They also enjoyed sports and games. For most of the 1700s, the colonists were content to be ruled by English laws.</p>
<h2 id=what-jobs-did-people-have-during-the-revolutionary-war>What jobs did people have during the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>Male jobs usually included blacksmiths, candle makers, apothecaries, tailors, wig makers, gun smiths, gold smiths, farmers, merchants and more. Men did most of the work during the war. Men getting ready for war. The men’s jobs were usually not the same as women’s jobs.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-common-job-in-1790>What was the most common job in 1790?</h2>
<p>Small-scale farming was the most widely held occupation for white families in the 1770s and into the 1780s. The 1790 census confirms this, which shows that roughly 94.9% of the population did not live in cities and towns, and rather, lived rurally, with the majority being farmers of some type.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-men-do-in-the-colony-of-georgia>What did men do in the colony of Georgia?</h2>
<p>Men in colonial Georgia were planters, farmers, tradesmen and politicians. Other jobs for men include: fur traders, merchants, medical professionals and carpenters. Menial labor jobs on plantations were often held by slaves and others of a lower social standing than land owners.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-jobs-did-people-have-in-colonial-times>What kind of jobs did people have in colonial times?</h2>
<p>There were many occupations in colonial times – butchers and bakers and candlestick makers and hatters and coopers and printers and cobblers and wheelwrights and all kinds of smiths and more!</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-work-did-coopers-do-in-colonial-america>What kind of work did Coopers do in colonial America?</h2>
<p>The cooper was a skilled trade as these containers needed to be durable and watertight for a long time. The gunsmith made and repaired firearms for the town. Gunsmiths had to be skilled in working with both wood and metal.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-trustees-of-the-georgia-colony-do>What did the trustees of the Georgia Colony do?</h2>
<p>They therefore did not establish a representative assembly, although every other mainland colony had one. The trustees made all laws for the colony. Second, the settlements were laid out in compact, confined, and concentrated townships.</p>
