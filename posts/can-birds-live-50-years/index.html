<h2 id=can-birds-live-50-years>Can birds live 50 years?</h2>
<p>Birds with long lifespans can live up to 50 years, though for many between 15 to 25 years is more common. The care and maintenance of these birds during their lifetime will have a lot to do with their overall length of life.</p>
<h2 id=what-bird-can-live-100-years>What bird can live 100 years?</h2>
<p>Macaws. Large parrots like Macaws are among the longest living parrot species. Healthy Macaw parrots live an average of 50 years. But they have been known to live up to 100 years!</p>
<h2 id=do-birds-die-of-old-age>Do birds die of old age?</h2>
<p>One reason is because most birds don’t die from old age, they’re killed and eaten by predators such as other birds and other animals, especially cats. Another reason is that birds migrate, and many die along the way and end up in rivers, lakes, and oceans. Of course, some ex-birds do end up on your lawn.</p>
<h2 id=what-bird-can-live-50-years>What bird can live 50 years?</h2>
<p>Macaws<br>
Macaws have been known to live well over 50 years in captivity.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-bird-that-lives-the-longest>What is the bird that lives the longest?</h2>
<p>The Surprisingly Complex Science of Bird Longevity</p>
<ul>
<li>Wisdom, a 69-year-old female Laysan Albatross, currently holds the record as the oldest-known wild bird.</li>
<li>Cookie, a Pink Cockatoo, lived to the age of 83, making her the world’s longest-living bird.</li>
<li>Red-tailed Hawks have been recorded living up to 30 years.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-do-we-never-see-dead-birds>Why do we never see dead birds?</h2>
<p>Birds, like many other creatures, will seek secluded, out-of-the-way places when they’re feeling sick – woodpeckers will climb into a hole in a tree, for example. Often, these predators will eat the prey themselves or take them back to feed their young, which is why it’s rare to find the remains of dead birds.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-i-never-see-dead-birds>Why do I never see dead birds?</h2>
<p>The most likely reason that we do not see dead birds is due to predators or disease. The simple fact of the matter is that a predator or scavenger has likely gotten to them first. This can include foxes, cats, rats, dogs, and a plethora of other animals.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-birds-usually-die>How do birds usually die?</h2>
<p>Trauma. Many bird die-offs are caused by massive trauma to birds’ heads, wings, and bodies from powerful collisions. This may lead to collisions with other birds in the air or with obstacles such as buildings, trees, wind turbines, electrical wires or radio towers.</p>
<h2 id=do-birds-hide-to-die>Do birds hide to die?</h2>
<p>Since they are sick and feel vulnerable, they will often hide away. Seclusion and rest can help them to recover in some cases. But in others, they will simply die in their hideouts and decompose before long. Birds are unlikely to simply drop dead out of the sky.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-life-span-of-a-bird>What’s the average life span of a bird?</h2>
<p>In fact, many factors determine the lifespan of a bird. First and foremost, a bird’s lifespan is determined by its species. Some live longer than others. For example, Cockatiels and Budgies can live up to 20 years if they are well cared, and their needs are met.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-life-span-of-a-seabird>What’s the average life span of a seabird?</h2>
<p>Generally, large birds, as well as seabirds, live longer than most small birds. Then there are albatrosses, penguins, terns, and some other seabirds which can live 30 to 50 years. Eagles live between 20 to 25 years and hawks for 8 to 20 years. Most songbirds live 8 to 12 years. Generally, Hummingbirds live between 6 and 8 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-common-birds-in-our-gardens-live>How old do common birds in our gardens live?</h2>
<p>For example, the average age of magpies in the countryside is 2.3 years but in urban areas 3.8 years. Most common garden birds have an average age of between 2 and 5 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-parrots-and-other-pet-birds-live>How old do parrots and other pet birds live?</h2>
<p>In reality, there is a wide range in the age that pet birds might reach and certainly, some will live longer (or shorter amounts of time) than the ages listed. African Gray Parrots:40 to 60 years, or more Amazon Parrots: 25 to 75 years Budgerigars (Parakeets):5 to 18 years</p>
