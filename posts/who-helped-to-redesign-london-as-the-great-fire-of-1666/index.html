<p>architect Sir Christopher Wren<br>
After the fire, architect Sir Christopher Wren submitted plans for rebuilding London to Charles II. An 18th-century copy of these plans is shown here. The narrow streets that had helped the fire spread are here replaced by wide avenues.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-thomas-farriner-ks1>Who was Thomas Farriner ks1?</h2>
<p>Thomas Farriner ( c. 1615 – 20 December 1670) was a British baker and churchwarden in 17th century London. His bakery in Pudding Lane was the source point for the Great Fire of London on 2 September 1666.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-london-like-after-the-great-fire>What was London like after the Great Fire?</h2>
<p>What happened after the fire? London had to be almost totally reconstructed. Temporary buildings were erected that were ill-equipped, disease spread easily, and many people died from this and the harsh winter that followed the fire. As well as loss of life, the financial costs were staggering.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-responsible-for-the-great-fire-of-london>Who was responsible for the Great Fire of London?</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the fire, the search for scapegoats led to the execution of Robert Hubert, a French watchmaker from Rouen. Hubert gave a false confession, stating that he threw a fireball through the window of Farriner’s bakery. It soon became clear, however, that Huber wasn’t even in the country at the time the fire started.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-houses-were-destroyed-in-the-great-fire-of-london>How many houses were destroyed in the Great Fire of London?</h2>
<p>It destroyed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St Paul’s Cathedral, and most of the buildings of the City authorities. It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City’s 80,000 inhabitants.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-great-fire-of-london-called-the-great-plague>Why was the Great Fire of London called the Great Plague?</h2>
<p>Firefighting was hampered by the lord mayor 1665-1666 was not a good time for the people of London. Not only was most of the city engulfed by what soon became known as The Great Fire of London in September 1666, but months before the most infamous outbreak of disease in British history occurred: the Great Plague. Watch Now</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-aristocracy-live-during-the-great-fire-of-london>Where did the aristocracy live during the Great Fire of London?</h2>
<p>The aristocracy shunned the City and lived either in the countryside beyond the slum suburbs, or in the exclusive Westminster district (the modern West End ), the site of King Charles II’s court at Whitehall.</p>
