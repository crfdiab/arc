<h2 id=what-event-caused-the-indus-valley-civilization-to-decline>What event caused the Indus Valley Civilization to decline?</h2>
<p>Many historians believe the Indus civilisation collapsed because of changes to the geography and climate of the area. Movements in the Earth’s crust (the outside layer) might have caused the Indus river to flood and change its direction.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-downfall-of-harappa-and-mohenjo-daro>What caused the downfall of Harappa and Mohenjo Daro?</h2>
<p>Apparently the Indus civillization was likely destroyed by the Indo-European migrants from Iran, the Aryans. The cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were built of fire-baked bricks. Over the centuries the need for wood for brick-making denuded the country side and this may have contributed to the downfall.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-monsoons-affect-the-indus-valley>How did monsoons affect the Indus Valley?</h2>
<p>The slow eastward migration of monsoons across the Asian continent initially supported the formation of the Harappan civilization in the Indus valley by allowing production of large agricultural surpluses, then decimated the civilization as water supplies for farming dried up, researchers reported Monday.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-causes-of-the-decline-of-the-harappan-civilization-class-6>What were the causes of the decline of the Harappan Civilization class 6?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Floods and Earthquakes -It is held by some scholars that floods in Mohenjo- Daro led to the abandonment of this settlement.</li>
<li>Increased Aridity-According to the renowned historian,D.P Agarwal and Sood,the Harappan civilization declined because of increasing aridity in the area and drying up of the river Ghaggar.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-indus-valley-civilization-which-thrived-for-many-years>What happened to the Indus Valley Civilization which thrived for many years?</h2>
<p>Why the Indus Valley Civilization declined and fell is unknown, but scholars believe it may have had to do with climate change, the drying up of the Sarasvati River, an alteration in the path of the monsoon which watered crops, overpopulation of the cities, a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia, or a …</p>
<h2 id=in-what-country-is-harappa-located-now>In what country is Harappa located now?</h2>
<p>Pakistan<br>
Harappa, village in eastern Punjab province, eastern Pakistan. It lies on the left bank of a now dry course of the Ravi River, west-southwest of the city of Sahiwal, about 100 miles (160 km) southwest of Lahore.</p>
<h2 id=why-were-monsoons-both-good-and-bad-for-the-indus-valley-people>Why were monsoons both good and bad for the Indus Valley people?</h2>
<p>Monsoons can be both helpful and detrimental to a climate, depending on whether they support or destroy vegetation and agriculture. The monsoons that came to the Indus River Valley aided the growth of agricultural surpluses, which supported the development of cities, such as Harappa.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-two-largest-ancient-settlements-in-the-indus-valley>What were the two largest ancient settlements in the Indus Valley?</h2>
<p>The Harappan civilization was located in the Indus River valley. Its two large cities, Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, were located in present-day Pakistan’s Punjab and Sindh provinces, respectively.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-mesopotamian-civilization-decline>Why did the Mesopotamian civilization decline?</h2>
<p>A new study suggests an ancient Mesopotamian civilization was likely wiped out by dust storms nearly 4,000 years ago. An ancient civilization that ruled Mesopotamia nearly 4,000 years ago was likely wiped out because of disastrous dust storms, a new study suggests.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-indus-valleys-decline>What was the cause of the Indus Valley’s decline?</h2>
<p>[2]Another school of t hought relates the demise of the Indus valley civilization to have been brought about by a major tectonic shift that caused continuous floods of this area. [6]Many scholars now believe the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization was caused by climate change.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-harappan-civilization-decline-after-1900-bc>Why did the Harappan civilization decline after 1900 BC?</h2>
<p>The Aryan invasion was believed to be major reason for the decline of Harappan Civilisation. The material culture transformed into a few Harappan sites so occupied after 1900 BC. Distinctive artifacts such as weights, seals, bead, etc. disappeared.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-indus-river-become-a-lake>How did the Indus River become a lake?</h2>
<p>The theory is that Indus area is a disturbed seismic zone and tectonic movements led to the creation of a gigantic natural dam that prevented the Indus from flowing towards the sea, turning the area around Mohenjodaro into a huge lake.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-destruction-of-mohenjodaro>What was the cause of the destruction of Mohenjodaro?</h2>
<p>Another criticism of this theory is that it fails to explain the decline of the settlements outside the Indus system. Lambrick believes that changes in the course of the river Indus could be the cause of the destruction of Mohenjodaro. The Indus is an unstable river system which keeps shifting its bed.</p>
