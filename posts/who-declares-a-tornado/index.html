<h2 id=who-declares-a-tornado>WHO declares a tornado?</h2>
<p>Tornado Warning They are usually issued for a duration of around 30 minutes. A Tornado Warning is issued by your local National Weather Service office (NWFO), see map below. It will include where the tornado was located and what towns will be in its path.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-tornado-alarm-work>How does the tornado alarm work?</h2>
<p>The warnings are broadcast from cell towers in the vicinity of the tornado and flash flood, so you will receive them if you are near the hazard. A NOAA Weather Radio receiver will sound an alarm to alert you when a storm warning is issued. The receivers needed to receive the alarm are available at electronics stores.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-tornado-sirens-go-off>Why do tornado sirens go off?</h2>
<p>The tornado sirens are activated with a signal from the NWS that indicates a tornado has been spotted or is strongly indicated on a Doppler radar and/or strong, damaging winds of 70 mph or greater are present. The alert goes off in the specific cities or towns that will be affected, not throughout the entire county.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-band-members-of-the-tornados>Who are the band members of the Tornados?</h2>
<p>On some promotional items, later lineups were credited as ‘Tornados ’65’ and ‘The New Tornados’, but these names were never used on The Tornados’ releases. In the mid-1960s The Tornados backed Billy Fury again, with Dave Watts on keyboards, Robby Gale on guitar and John Davies on drums.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-manufacturer-of-the-panavia-tornado>Who is the manufacturer of the Panavia Tornado?</h2>
<p>Panavia Tornado. The Panavia Tornado is a family of twin-engine, variable-sweep wing multirole combat aircraft, jointly developed and manufactured by Italy, the United Kingdom, and West Germany.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-anything-you-can-do-to-prevent-a-tornado>Is there anything you can do to prevent a tornado?</h2>
<p>After a tornado, the wreckage left behind poses additional injury risks. Although nothing can be done to prevent tornadoes, there are actions you can take for your health and safety. Be Ready! Tornadoes This infographic includes important tips on being ready before and during a tornado.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-tornados-lose-their-popularity-in-the-uk>When did the Tornados lose their popularity in the UK?</h2>
<p>For a time The Tornados were considered serious rivals to The Shadows. The Tornados’ single “Globetrotter” made it to #5 in the UK Singles Chart. However, pop instrumentals began to lose popularity with British audiences during the course of 1963 as the “Mersey Sound”, most notably The Beatles, became more and more popular.</p>
