<p>The most important factor for Parliament’s victory was the signing of the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643, which provided the terms on which the Scottish entered the war.</p>

<p>The struggle between King Charles I and his Westminster Parliament over who should control the army needed to crush the Irish insurrection in turn provoked the outbreak of civil war in England (August 1642). Since 1642 the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny had controlled Irish affairs and periodically aided Charles.</p>

<p>The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. Unlike other civil wars in England, which were mainly fought over who should rule, these conflicts were also concerned with how the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland should be governed.</p>

<p>Why did Parliament win the First Civil War? Parliament won the First Civil War primarily due to their legislative prowess and financial superiority over the King and his Royalist faction.</p>

<p>This states that MP’s couldn’t become army commanders so the army was led by people who knew what they were doing. The Royalists, on the other hand, were led by Prince Rupert who had learnt his trade in the 30 years war and spent much of his time setting fire to towns.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the Royalist control lay over the poor, sparsely populated areas of the Country. This included Wales, the North, and portions of the South-West. In spite of of the victory of Parliament, in the beginning the Royalists were better off financially, despite their limited land held.</p>
