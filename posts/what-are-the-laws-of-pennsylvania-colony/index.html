<p>The “Great Law” provided a stable foundation for Pennsylvania’s representative government. Settlers in most other colonies in America had to contend for what Penn offered immediately. His emphasis on the involvement of the people, however limited, also was inconsistent with the trend in England.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-illegal-in-pennsylvania>What is illegal in Pennsylvania?</h2>

<h2 id=what-problems-did-the-pennsylvania-colony-face>What problems did the Pennsylvania Colony face?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-the-weirdest-law-in-pa>What is the weirdest law in PA?</h2>
<p>It is illegal to hunt a big game animal that is swimming. And it’s also illegal to hunt in a cemetery… Good, that’s just weird. It is illegal to ride in a boat on a trailer while it is being driven on a highway — same goes for mobile homes on trailers.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-law-in-the-delaware-colony>What was the law in the Delaware Colony?</h2>
<p>Delaware Colony. In Delaware, colonists were required by law to have a gun. Pennsylvania did hot have the same law.

<h2 id=what-was-the-charter-of-the-pennsylvania-colony>What was the Charter of the Pennsylvania Colony?</h2>
