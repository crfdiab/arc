<h2 id=who-brought-israel-to-the-promised-land>Who brought Israel to the promised land?</h2>
<p>Joshua<br>
After the incident with the 12 spies, Joshua lived through the 40 year wandering period, and was named successor to Moses as instructed by God. Joshua completed the task of leading the Israelites into the Promised Land and of taking possession of it.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-moses-to-get-to-the-promised-land>How long did it take Moses to get to the promised land?</h2>
<p>Corresponding to the 40 days that the spies toured the land, God decreed that the Israelites would wander in the wilderness for 40 years as a result of their unwillingness to take the land.</p>
<h2 id=what-year-was-the-exodus>What year was the Exodus?</h2>
<p>13th century bce<br>
Exodus, the liberation of the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt in the 13th century bce, under the leadership of Moses; also, the Old Testament book of the same name.</p>
<h2 id=who-finally-led-the-israelites-to-canaan>Who finally led the Israelites to Canaan?</h2>
<p>Joshua, also spelled Josue, Hebrew Yehoshua (“Yahweh is deliverance”), the leader of the Israelite tribes after the death of Moses, who conquered Canaan and distributed its lands to the 12 tribes. His story is told in the Old Testament Book of Joshua.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-were-the-israelites-from-the-promised-land>How far were the Israelites from the Promised Land?</h2>
<p>The total straight line distance between Egypt and Canaan is 8482 KM (kilometers) and 583.09 meters.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-moses-bring-the-children-of-israel-to-the-promised-land>When did Moses bring the children of Israel to the Promised Land?</h2>
<p>Near the beginning of the 40-year journey through the wilderness at about the two and half year mark, God brings the children of Israel up to the borders of the Promised Land – the land of Canaan. According to Biblical timelines, this would have been about 1449 B.C. Moses sent 12 spies into the land to investigate it out before decided to enter in.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-god-take-the-israelites-the-long-way-to-the-promised-land>Why did God take the Israelites the long way to the Promised Land?</h2>
<p>When we think of the children of Israel’s trip from Egypt to Canaan, we think it took longer just because they sent the spies into the Promised Land and God made them Wilderness Wanderers for forty years to think about why that was a wrong move (Num. 14: 34). But even from the get-go, they were going out of their way.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-appointed-to-lead-the-israelites-after-moses-died>Who was appointed to lead the Israelites after Moses died?</h2>
<p>Joshua, son of Nun, was an attendant and helper to Moses during the Israelites’ 40-year trek through the Sinai wilderness. He was appointed by God to lead the Israelites after the death of Moses.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-yahweh-show-moses-the-promised-land>When did Yahweh show Moses the Promised Land?</h2>
<p>Yahweh (God) shows Moses the Promised Land (Frans Pourbus the Elder, c. 1565–80) The promise that is the basis of the term is contained in several verses of Genesis in the Torah.</p>
