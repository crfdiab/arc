<h2 id=what-signs-will-tell-you-that-a-lightning-is-close-enough-to-harm-you>What signs will tell you that a lightning is close enough to harm you?</h2>
<p>Equate thunder with lightning, even if lightning is not visible where you are. If you can hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning. Even if you can’t hear thunder, you might nonetheless be at risk.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-you-not-do-during-a-thunderstorm>What should you not do during a thunderstorm?</h2>
<p>Don’t</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid water. Do NOT bathe, shower, wash dishes, or have any other contact with water during a thunderstorm because lightning can travel through a building’s plumbing.</li>
<li>Avoid electronic equipment.</li>
<li>Avoid corded phones.</li>
<li>Avoid windows, doors, porches, and concrete.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-bad-does-it-hurt-to-be-struck-by-lightning>How bad does it hurt to be struck by lightning?</h2>
<p>According to Dr. Claypool, lightning can cause temporary blindness and can potentially rupture an eardrum. These, however, are minor issues when compared to serious burns, chronic pain, and head trauma that could lead to memory issues and other long-term ailments that can occur if you’re struck by lightning.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-your-odds-of-getting-struck-by-lightning>What are your odds of getting struck by lightning?</h2>
<p>The chances of being struck by lightning are 300,000 to one, with 24,000 people hit and killed a year, says the BBC.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-you-tell-if-a-thunderstorm-is-on-top-of-you>How can you tell if a thunderstorm is on top of You?</h2>
<p>If you see a thunderstorm in the distance, see a flash of lightning, and count 15 seconds before you hear the thunder, then the thunderstorm you see is three miles away (15 seconds / 5 = 3 miles). If the lightning and thunder seem to strike at the same time, then the thunderstorm is right on top of you (0 seconds / 5 = 0 miles).</p>
<h2 id=how-to-tell-how-far-away-a-storm-is-with-lightning>How to tell how far away a storm is with lightning?</h2>
<p>After you see a flash of lightning, count the number of seconds until you hear the thunder. (Use the stop watch or count “One-Mississippi, Two-Mississippi, Three-Mississippi,” etc.) For every 5 seconds the storm is one mile away. Divide the number of seconds you count by 5 to get the number of miles.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-calculate-the-distance-from-a-thunderstorm>How to calculate the distance from a thunderstorm?</h2>
<p>For example, if you counted to 15 seconds before you heard thunder, divide 15 by 5 to get 3 miles. To calculate the distance in kilometers, divide the seconds by 3 instead. So, 15 divided by 3 would be 5 kilometers in distance.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-hear-a-thunderstorm-one-mile-away>How long does it take to hear a thunderstorm one mile away?</h2>
<p>At this speed, the time it takes for a person one mile away from a thunderstorm to hear the thunder is five seconds. Essentially, when you are counting the seconds it takes for the thunder to reach you, you are using the speed of sound to measure your distance to the thunderstorm.</p>
