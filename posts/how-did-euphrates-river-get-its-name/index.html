<h2 id=how-did-euphrates-river-get-its-name>How did Euphrates river get its name?</h2>
<p>The name Euphrates may have originated from Old Persian Ufratu, as it were from Avestan *hu-perethuua, meaning “good to cross over” (from hu-, meaning “good”, and peretu, meaning “ford”) . Alternatively, some suggest that the name Euphrates is possibly of Kurdish origin.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-euphrates-river-named>When was the Euphrates river named?</h2>
<p>The name is Yeprat in Armenian (Եփրատ), Perat in Hebrew (פרת), Fırat in Turkish and Firat in Kurdish. The earliest references to the Euphrates come from cuneiform texts found in Shuruppak and pre-Sargonic Nippur in southern Iraq and date to the mid-3rd millennium BCE.</p>
<h2 id=is-euphrates-a-god>Is Euphrates a God?</h2>
<p>EUPHRATES was a river-god of Assyria in west Asia (modern Turkey and Iraq). The river Euphrates flowed south from the highlands of eastern Anatolia through the heart of Assyria. Other important rivers of the east were the Tigris of Assyria, Orontes of Syria, and the Ganges and Hydaspes of India.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-river-euphrates-in-the-bible>Where was the river Euphrates in the Bible?</h2>
<p>In the OT, the river Euphrates was along the boundary of the Garden of Eden. When God made his covenant with Abraham, he gave him the land from the Nile to the Euphrates (Gen. 15:18). Osborne writes, “In 1 Enoch 56.5–57.3, the “angels of punishment” (56.1; cf. 53.3; 62.11) turn to the east to the Parthians and Medes and get them to attack Israel.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-the-greek-name-euphrates>What is the meaning of the Greek name Euphrates?</h2>
<p>The Greek name Euphrates consists of two elements. The first part is the adverb ευ, meaning good, well, noble: The familiar adverb ευ ( eu) means good or noble. It occurs mostly in compounds.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-euphrates-river-in-iraq-dying>Why is the Euphrates River in Iraq dying?</h2>
<p>Due to extreme weather conditions and excessive pollution, there is barely enough water to be able to float a canoe properly. According to the Iraqi River Police, there is garbage in the water which has turned the river a murky green and the waterway sluggish.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-tigris-and-euphrates-river-begin-to-grow>When did the Tigris and Euphrates River begin to grow?</h2>
<p>The growth of cities and the continued prosperity of ancient agriculture in the Tigris & Euphrates River basin (part of the fabled Fertile Crescent of ancient history) fostered local cultural pursuits, and it is around 3000 B.C.E. that we first have evidence of sustained religious organization, artwork, and urban development.</p>
