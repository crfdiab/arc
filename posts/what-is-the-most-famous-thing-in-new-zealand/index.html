<h2 id=what-are-the-most-famous-things-about-new-zealand>What are the most famous things about New Zealand?</h2>
<p>The sheep are easily one of the most famous things about New Zealand. In 1982 there were 22 sheep for every person in New Zealand.

However, out of all the places, there are certain destinations that obviously have more significance than the others.</p>

It was first performed in 1888 and is a thrilling pre-match spectacle to watch with lots of foot-stomping, eye-rolling, tongue poking, leaping and body slapping while they perform the loud chant.</p>
<h2 id=where-to-see-the-best-marine-life-in-new-zealand>Where to see the best marine life in New Zealand?</h2>
