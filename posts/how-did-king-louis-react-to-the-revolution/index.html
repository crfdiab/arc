<h2 id=how-did-king-louis-react-to-the-revolution>How did King Louis react to the revolution?</h2>
<p>Louis’s reaction to the Revolution After 1789 Louis XVI’s incapacity to rule, his irresolution, and his surrender to reactionary influences at court were partially responsible for the failure to establish in France the forms of a limited constitutional monarchy.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-louis-xvi-feel-about-being-crowned-king>How did Louis XVI feel about being crowned king?</h2>
<p>When Louis XVI acceded to the throne in 1774, he was nineteen years old. He had an enormous responsibility, as the government was deeply in debt, and resentment of despotic monarchy was on the rise. He himself felt woefully unqualified to resolve the situation.</p>
<h2 id=why-louis-xiv-called-sun-king>Why Louis XIV called Sun King?</h2>
<p>And why was Louis XIV called the Sun King? It’s a name he gave himself! He saw France as a kingdom that revolved around him, just like planets revolved around the sun. So when Mazarin died in 1661, Louis disappointed everyone: he was now 22, and he decided he was an adult.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-king-louis-do-wrong>What did king Louis do wrong?</h2>
<p>Louis XVI’s Execution Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were executed for treason. Louis had failed to address France’s financial problems, instigating the French Revolution that eventually descended upon him. He made matters worse by often escaping to more pleasurable activities like hunting and locksmithing.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-louis-xvi-hated>Why was Louis XVI hated?</h2>
<p>Only 20 years old at the time, Louis XVI was immature and lacked self-confidence. While Louis XVI wanted to be a good king and help his subjects, he faced enormous debt and rising resentment towards a despotic monarchy. His failure to successfully address serious fiscal problems would dog him for most of his reign.</p>
<h2 id=was-louis-the-14-a-good-king>Was Louis the 14 a good king?</h2>
<p>Louis XIV called himself the ‘Sun King’ and his reign is famous for the extension of absolute royal rule and the building of the palace at Versailles which seemed to summarise Louis XIV’s reign. Louis XIV’s education was thorough but had a major input of physical work so that he was seen to be a strong ruler.</p>
<h2 id=why-king-louis-was-a-bad-king>Why King Louis was a bad king?</h2>
<p>While Louis XVI wanted to be a good king and help his subjects, he faced enormous debt and rising resentment towards a despotic monarchy. His failure to successfully address serious fiscal problems would dog him for most of his reign.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-louis-xiv-live-during-his-reign>Where did Louis XIV live during his reign?</h2>
<p>Louis XIV, king of France (1643–1715), ruled his country, principally from his great palace at Versailles, during one of the country’s most brilliant periods. Today he remains the symbol of absolute monarchy of the classical age. How old was Louis XIV when he acceded to the throne?</p>
<h2 id=how-was-versailles-during-the-time-of-louis-xiv-really-looked>How was Versailles during the time of Louis XIV really looked?</h2>
<p>Bright Side tried to figure out how much merit these claims have and what Versailles and its residents of the time of Louis XIV were really all about. Common fact: Versailles during the reign of Louis XIV was a smelly place. But is this really true?</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-fronde-affect-king-louis-xiv>How did the Fronde affect King Louis XIV?</h2>
<p>This marked the beginning of the long civil war known as the Fronde, in the course of which Louis suffered poverty, misfortune, fear, humiliation, cold, and hunger. These trials shaped the future character, behaviour, and mode of thought of the young king.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-louis-xiv-get-rid-of-the-nobles>How did Louis XIV get rid of the nobles?</h2>
<p>Despite the use of pensions and punishments, the monarchy had been unable to subdue the nobles, who had started 11 civil wars in 40 years. Louis lured them to his court, corrupted them with gambling, exhausted them with dissipation, and made their destinies dependent on their capacity to please him. Etiquette became a means of governing.</p>
