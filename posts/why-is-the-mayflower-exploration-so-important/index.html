<h2 id=why-is-the-mayflower-exploration-so-important>Why is the Mayflower exploration so important?</h2>
<p>Out of all the voyages to the American colonies from 1620 to 1640, the Mayflower’s first crossing of Pilgrim Fathers has become the most culturally iconic and important in the history of migration from Europe to the New World during the Age of Discovery.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-mayflower-bring-to-america>What did the Mayflower bring to America?</h2>
<p>The passengers brought dried meat and fish, grains and flour, dried fruit, cheese, hard biscuits, and other foods with them. They had to eat the food they brought until they could plant and harvest a garden. But, they caught and ate fish and wild game once they landed in North America.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-the-mayflower-compact-have-on-the-creation-of-the-united-states>What impact did the Mayflower Compact have on the creation of the United States?</h2>
<p>The Mayflower Compact continued the idea of law made by the people. This idea lies at the heart of democracy. From its crude beginning in Plymouth, self-government evolved into the town meetings of New England and larger local governments in colonial America.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-mayflower-compact-lead-to>What did the Mayflower Compact lead to?</h2>
<p>The Mayflower Compact was important because it was the first document to establish self-government in the New World. It remained active until 1691 when Plymouth Colony became part of Massachusetts Bay Colony.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-importance-of-the-mayflower-ship>What was the importance of the Mayflower ship?</h2>
<p>The History of the Mayflower Ship. The Mayflower is one of the most important ships in American history. This cargo ship brought the pilgrims to Massachusetts during the Great Puritan Migration in the 17th century. These pilgrims were some of the first settlers to America after they established the Plymouth colony.</p>

<p>Why Was the Mayflower Compact Important? The Mayflower Compact was important because it was the first document to establish self-government in the New World. It remained active until 1691 when Plymouth Colony became part of Massachusetts Bay Colony.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-mayflower-celebrated-400-years-ago>Why was the Mayflower celebrated 400 years ago?</h2>
<p>It is estimated that up to tens of millions of Americans have at least one ancestor who was among the group of early settlers who arrived in the country 400 years ago. The day will also be remembered for the colonisation of North America that had a huge impact on the way of life and culture of native Americans living in the US today.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-mayflower-land-in-massachusetts-instead-of-virginia>Why did the Mayflower land in Massachusetts instead of Virginia?</h2>
<p>London stockholders financed the Pilgrim’s voyage with the understanding they’d be repaid in profits from the new settlement. But when the Mayflower landed in Massachusetts instead of Virginia, discord began before the colonists even left the ship. The strangers argued the Virginia Company contract was void.</p>
