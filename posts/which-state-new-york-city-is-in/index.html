New York/State</p>
<h2 id=why-is-new-york-a-city-and-a-state>Why is New York a city and a state?</h2>
<p>New York City is made up of five counties, it is in New York State. So, the borough of Manhattan (The City) is the same as New York County, which is a part of New York City, which is a city in New York State.</p>
<h2 id=what-came-first-new-york-or-state>What came first New York or State?</h2>
<p>The city came the city came first. (Why does quora text always repeat?) The city originally, in 1626, was literally a trading post of the Dutch West India Company. Nederlands claimed the land between the Delaware River west of New Jersey to the Connecticut River in the middle of Connecticut.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-state-is-new-york-state>What kind of state is New York State?</h2>
<p>New York is a state in the northeastern United States. It is sometimes called New York State when there is need to distinguish it from New York City. Because of the preponderance of the population concentrated in the southern portion around New York City, the state is often regionalized into Upstate and Downstate.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-continent-that-new-york-is-on>Which is the continent that New York is on?</h2>
<p>New York City (as well as New York State, and the rest of the United States) is on the continent of North America. New York is a state in the northeastern United States. It is sometimes called New York State when there is need to distinguish it from New York City.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-city-in-new-york-city>Which is the largest city in New York City?</h2>
<p>Manhattan is home to Central Park, Broadway, The Empire State Building and many more iconic locations. But “The City” extends far beyond Manhattan. NYC is made up of five boroughs, or counties: Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. Together, they make up the largest (and most populous) city in the entire country.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-borough-of-new-york-the-same-as-the-city>Is the borough of New York the same as the city?</h2>
<p>So, the borough of Manhattan (The City) is the same as New York County, which is a part of New York City, which is a city in New York State. Bonus answer: A Borough is a County that has been incorporated into a City. The Borough of Manhattan is the same as New York County.</p>
