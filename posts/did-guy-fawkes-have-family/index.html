<h2 id=did-guy-fawkes-have-family>Did Guy Fawkes have family?</h2>
<p>Family: Guy Fawkes’s father, Edward Fawkes, worked for the Church of England, and his mother was named Edith. In 1568, before Guy was born, Edith gave birth to a daughter who died several weeks later. Fawkes had two sisters who lived into adulthood, named Anne and Elizabeth.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-guy-fawkes-childhood-like>What was Guy Fawkes childhood like?</h2>
<p>During his childhood he was raised as a Protestant. After his father’s death his mother remarried to a Catholic man and Guy converted to Catholicism. By 1595 Guy Fawkes had left England to join the Spanish army, fighting in the ‘War of Religion’. During his time in the army he became an expert in explosives.</p>
<h2 id=what-name-did-guy-fawkes>What name did Guy Fawkes?</h2>
<p>When he was caught by the King’s men, at first he claimed his name was John Johnson. However after being tortured, he was forced to sign a confession to his role in the Gunpowder Plot, and this he signed as ‘Guido Fawkes’.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-family-background-of-guy-fawkes>What was the family background of Guy Fawkes?</h2>
<p>The Gunpowder Plot was a chapter in the long history of conflict between Britain’s Protestants and Catholics, and the religious dichotomy was present in Guy Fawkes’s own family background. Fawkes was born on April 13, 1570, in the town of Stonegate in England’s Yorkshire region. He had two sisters, Anne and Elizabeth.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-fawkes-family-live-in-york>Where did the Fawkes family live in York?</h2>
<p>Today the Horton-Fawkes family still live at the hall and have grown used to talking about their links with their infamous relative. Guy – or Guido – Fawkes was born in 1570 in York, the only son of Edith Blake and Edward Fawkes, a notary or proctor of the ecclesiastical courts.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-edward-fawkes-live-when-he-died>Where did Edward Fawkes live when he died?</h2>
<p>Edward Fawkes died when Guy was eight, and his mother showed her true sympathies by marrying another recusant, Denis (or Dionysus) Bainbridge, described by an acquaintance (according to the Gunpowder Plot Society) as “more ornamental than useful.” The family moved to a home near the village of Scotton in North Yorkshire.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-guy-fawkes-related-to-the-gunpowder-plot>How is Guy Fawkes related to the Gunpowder Plot?</h2>
<p>Every year on 5 November people mark the anniversary of the failure of the Gunpowder Plot. Family: Guy Fawkes’s father, Edward Fawkes, worked for the Church of England, and his mother was named Edith. In 1568, before Guy was born, Edith gave birth to a daughter who died several weeks later.</p>
