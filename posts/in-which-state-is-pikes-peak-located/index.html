<p>Colorado<br>
Pikes Peak, peak in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in El Paso county, Colorado, U.S., 10 miles (16 km) west of Colorado Springs. It ranks 32nd in elevation (14,115 feet [4,302 metres]) among Colorado peaks and is widely known because of its commanding location and easy accessibility.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-drive-up-to-pikes-peak-scary>Is the drive up to Pikes Peak scary?</h2>
<p>The Pikes Peak scenic drive is nothing short of spectacular while being very scary for some. At times, it appears to be heading straight to the clouds.</p>
<h2 id=how-hard-is-the-drive-up-pikes-peak>How hard is the drive up Pikes Peak?</h2>
<p>The drive to the Pikes Peak Summit is 19 miles long, has 156 turns, and climbs 6,715 ft from the entrance of the highway. That might sound scary, but as long as you use common sense, are cautious, and follow the guidelines, driving to the top of Pikes Peak is not dangerous at all!</p>
<h2 id=where-is-pikes-peak-state-park-in-wisconsin>Where is Pikes Peak State Park in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>Pikes Peak State Park is located on a bluff high above the Mississippi River at the confluence with Wisconsin River. Fall colors were prime and we thoroughly enjoyed the exercise, fall color and the views. Suggest edits to improve what we show.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-pike-lake-unit-in-wisconsin>Where is the pike lake unit in Wisconsin?</h2>
<p>The Pike Lake Unit of the Kettle Moraine State Forest is in the middle of the Kettle Moraine, a strip of glacial landforms which extends through southeast Wisconsin. The forest is named after the 522-acre, spring-fed kettle lake. Powder Hill, a large glacial kame, provides terrific views of the landscape.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-bluff-at-pikes-peak>How tall is the bluff at Pikes Peak?</h2>
<p>Pikes Peak, in the heart of one of the nation’s most picturesque regions, offers a unique combination of scenic beauty, history, and outdoor recreation opportunity. From the top of the 500-foot bluff, the confluence of the Wisconsin River and the mighty Mississippi may be seen to the south.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-pikes-peak-state-park-so-important>Why was Pikes Peak State Park so important?</h2>
<p>After the Louisiana Purchase, the government sent Zebulon Pike in 1805 to explore the Mississippi valley and select locations suitable for military posts. Pike recognized the park site as an important, strategic point, and an excellent location for a fort.</p>
