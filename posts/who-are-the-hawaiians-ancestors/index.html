<h2 id=what-race-are-native-hawaiians>What race are native Hawaiians?</h2>
<p>Native Hawaiians, or simply Hawaiians (Hawaiian: kānaka ʻōiwi, kānaka maoli, and Hawaiʻi maoli), are the Indigenous Polynesian people of the Hawaiian Islands.

<h2 id=what-kind-of-family-did-the-hawaiians-have>What kind of family did the Hawaiians have?</h2>
<p>In old Hawaii, life revolved around the extended family and the clan; it was an ‘ohana’ (family) society (a group of both closely and distantly related people who share nearly everything: land, food, children, status, and the spirit of aloha.)

<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-of-the-ancient-hawaiians>What was the religion of the ancient Hawaiians?</h2>
<p>Hawaiian scholar Mary Kawena Pukui, who was raised in Kaʻū, Hawaii, maintained that the early Hawaiian gods were benign. One Molokaʻi tradition follows this line of thought. Author and researcher Pali Jae Lee writes: “During these ancient times, the only ‘religion’ was one of family and oneness with all things.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-social-status-of-the-ancient-hawaiians>What was the social status of the ancient Hawaiians?</h2>
