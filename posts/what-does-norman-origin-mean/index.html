<h2 id=is-norman-a-demon>Is Norman a demon?</h2>
<p>Norman took on the identity of James Ratri/William Minerva because he can not (in good conscience) call himself “Norman” anymore. He’s a Demon now… so it would simply be better if his family remembers Norman as he once was. Instead of the monster that he has become.</p>

<p>These settlers later became known as Norman Irish or Hiberno-Normans.

<p>The Normans ( Norman: Normaunds; French: Normands; Latin: Nortmanni/Normanni) were inhabitants of the early medieval Duchy of Normandy, descended from Norse Vikings (after whom Normandy was named), indigenous Franks and Gallo-Romans.
