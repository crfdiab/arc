<p>Sam Houston<br>
Battle of San Jacinto: April 1836 On April 21, 1836, Sam Houston and some 800 Texans defeated Santa Anna’s Mexican force of approximately 1,500 men at the Battle of San Jacinto, shouting “Remember the Alamo!” and “Remember Goliad!” as they attacked.</p>

<p>General Samuel Houston<br>
Led by General Samuel Houston, the Texan Army engaged and defeated General Antonio López de Santa Anna’s Mexican army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes. A detailed, first-hand account of the battle was written by General Houston from the headquarters of the Texan Army in San Jacinto on April 25, 1836.</p>

<p>General Martín Perfecto de Cos<br>
On October 28, 1835, as the Texan Army lay siege to San Antonio, a group of Texans and the Mexican Army clashed, at Mission Concepción. During the foggy morning skirmish, Bowie and Fannin led a group of Texans to victory over a detachment of 275 Mexican Army troops led by General Martín Perfecto de Cos.</p>

<p>The Texans won the final and decisive engagement with Mexico in the Texas Revolution on April 21, 1836 at the Battle of San Jacinto. While the battle only lasted 18 minutes, its ramifications were great.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-mexican-president-during-the-texas-revolution>Who was the Mexican president during the Texas Revolution?</h2>
<p>Mexican President/General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna marched north with a massive army to put down the rebellion. He defeated the Texans at the legendary Battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836. This was followed by the Goliad Massacre, in which some 350 rebellious Texan prisoners were executed.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-mexican-general-at-san-jacinto>Who was the Mexican general at San Jacinto?</h2>
<p>There were still three large Mexican armies in Texas, under Generals Filisola, Urrea and Gaona: any one of them was large enough to potentially defeat Houston and his men. Houston and his officers spoke with Santa Anna for hours before deciding on a course of action.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-battle-of-the-texas-revolution>What was the First Battle of the Texas Revolution?</h2>
<p>After the Texan forces swelled to outnumber their adversaries (and challenged the Mexicans to “come and take it” [the cannon]), they attacked on October 2 and forced the Mexicans to retreat to San Antonio, thus winning the Texas Revolution’s first skirmish, which came to be known as the Battle of Gonzales.</p>
