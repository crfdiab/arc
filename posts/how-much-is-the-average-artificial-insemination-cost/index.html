<h2 id=how-much-is-the-average-artificial-insemination-cost>How much is the average artificial insemination cost?</h2>
<p>The cost of artificial insemination varies according to whether a couple is using their sperm or a donor sperm and which procedure is being used. Most doctors report that the cost is anywhere from about $300 – $1000 per cycle for intrauterine insemination and less for intracervical insemination.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-inject-sperm-into-uterus>How much does it cost to inject sperm into uterus?</h2>
<p>Insemination – Insemination and sperm wash are part of every IUI cycle (the procedure itself). This is when the sperm are prepared then injected directly into the woman’s uterus. You can expect this to cost $1000 on average. If you’re using donor sperm, additional costs are incurred through a donor agency.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-sperm-to-get-pregnant>How much does it cost to buy sperm to get pregnant?</h2>
<p>Conceiving with donor sperm and IUI Costs vary, since sperm banks and fertility centers all set their own prices, but a vial of donor sperm generally costs $900 to $1,000. The insemination procedure itself is often about $200 to $400, though it can be higher.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-mix-sperm-with-artificial-insemination>Can you mix sperm with artificial insemination?</h2>
<p>Mixing an oligoasthenospermic husband’s semen with that of a donor prior to insemination (AIM) has been criticized, since such semen may contain antibodies which could interfere with normal sperm function. The efficacy of AIM was reviewed in 227 patients who underwent AI with frozen donor semen.</p>
<h2 id=can-u-get-pregnant-if-you-insert-sperm-with-a-syringe>Can u get pregnant if you insert sperm with a syringe?</h2>
