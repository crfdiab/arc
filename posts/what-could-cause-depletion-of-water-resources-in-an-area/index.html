<p>Causes of Groundwater Depletion</p>
<ul>
<li>Groundwater depletion most commonly occurs because of the frequent pumping of water from the ground.</li>
<li>We continuously pump groundwater from aquifers and it does not have enough time to replenish itself.</li>
<li>Agricultural needs require a large amount of groundwater.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-causes-of-water-depletion-in-the-human-body>What are the major causes of water depletion in the human body?</h2>
<p>Causes of Water Scarcity</p>
<ul>
<li>Overuse of Water. Water overuse is a huge issue that a lot of people are dealing with.</li>
<li>Pollution of Water.</li>
<li>Conflict.</li>
<li>Distance.</li>
<li>Drought.</li>
<li>Governmental Access.</li>
<li>Global Warming.</li>
<li>Illegal dumping.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-do-humans-affect-surface-water>How do humans affect surface water?</h2>
<p>Some human activities, such as pumping water into the ground for oil and gas extraction, can cause an aquifer to hold too much ground water. Too much ground water discharge to streams can lead to erosion and alter the balance of aquatic plant and animal species.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-conserve-the-water-resources>How can we conserve the water resources?</h2>
<p>Why do we need to Conserve Water?</p>
<ol>
<li>Keeping the tap closed when not in use.</li>
<li>Check for the openings or leaks in water distribution pipes.</li>
<li>Make sure to use collected rainwater for gardening or washing purpose.</li>
<li>Always have a measure of how many buckets of water is wasted in a day and try to reduce.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-can-we-reduce-ground-water-level>How can we reduce ground water level?</h2>
<p>What can I do to reduce pollution?</p>
<ol>
<li>properly dispose of all waste; don’t dump chemicals down drains or on the ground.</li>
<li>test underground fuel oil tanks for leaks; if possible, replace them above ground.</li>
<li>safely store all chemicals and fuels.</li>
<li>minimize the use of chemicals; always use according to directions.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-effects-of-water-depletion>What are some of the effects of water depletion?</h2>
<p>EFFECTS OF WATER DEPLETION 1 Deep wells : as a result of water depletion, deep wells need to be dug because of the water shortage. 2 Expensive resource : water being a renewable resource, it will become very expensive due to limited availability. 3 Contamination : one of the major effects of depletion is contamination.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-causes-of-resource-depletion>What are some of the causes of resource depletion?</h2>
<p>Deforestation often leads to erosion and soil depletion, and some farming practices introduce toxins to the soil and deplete water reserves. Industries expand to meet the demands of the growing world population, consuming increasing amounts of resources.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-the-depletion-of-water-resources-in-india>What causes the depletion of water resources in India?</h2>
<p>The personal water use by an urban Indian is given in table 4.3 The depletion of water resources is attributed to the following causes: 1. High demand for water: Coupled with population explosion, the rapid industrialization and technological development require large quantity of water for their maintenance.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-urbanization-cause-a-lot-of-water-depletion>Why does urbanization cause a lot of water depletion?</h2>
<p>Urbanization : the government and the people have behind urbanization. This has really affected the water resources because of mass deforestation. Seepage : when the collected water is transported through the canals and pumps, a lot of water is seeped into the ground and lost. This again causes depletion.</p>
