<h2 id=how-did-agriculture-and-settled-life-develop>How did agriculture and settled life develop?</h2>
<p>Agricultural communities developed approximately 10,000 years ago when humans began to domesticate plants and animals. By establishing domesticity, families and larger groups were able to build communities and transition from a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle dependent on foraging and hunting for survival.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-early-life-change-with-the-development-of-farming>How did early life change with the development of farming?</h2>
<p>When early humans began farming, they were able to produce enough food that they no longer had to migrate to their food source. This meant they could build permanent structures, and develop villages, towns, and eventually even cities. Closely connected to the rise of settled societies was an increase in population.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-early-man-start-after-settled-life-began>What did early man start after settled life began?</h2>
<p>They built settlements near the crop lands, cultivated fields, made weapons and stone tools and pottery. They also started domesticating animals for various purposes.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-north-america-develop-agriculture>When did North America develop agriculture?</h2>
<p>Agriculture began independently in both North and South America ∼10,000 years before present (YBP), within a few thousand years of the arrival of humans in the Americas. This contrasts with the thousands of years that people were present in the old world before agriculture developed.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-men-begin-to-live-a-settled-life>When did men begin to live a settled life?</h2>
<p>Sometime about 10,000 years ago, the earliest farmers put down their roots—literally and figuratively. Agriculture opened the door to (theoretically) stable food supplies, and it let hunter-gatherers build permanent dwellings that eventually morphed into complex societies in many parts of the world.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-agriculture-begin-in-the-us>When did agriculture begin in the US?</h2>
<p>The earliest evidence of crops appears between 9000 and 8000 bp in Mexico and South America. The first crops in eastern North America may be almost as old, but substantial evidence for crop use there begins between 5000 and 4000 bp.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-development-of-agriculture-change-the-world>How did the development of Agriculture change the world?</h2>
<p>Out of agriculture, cities and civilizations grew, and because crops and animals could now be farmed to meet demand, the global population rocketed — from some five million people 10,000 years ago, to more than seven billion today.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-crop-grown-in-north-america>When was the first crop grown in North America?</h2>
<p>While maize-like plants derived from teosinte appear to have been cultivated at least 9,000 years ago, the first directly dated corn cob dates only to around 5,500 years ago. Corn later reached North America, where cultivated sunflowers also started to bloom some 5,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-millet-farming-start-in-the-neolithic-era>When did millet farming start in the Neolithic era?</h2>
<p>Though the transition from wild harvesting was gradual, the switch from a nomadic to a settled way of life is marked by the appearance of early Neolithic villages with homes equipped with grinding stones for processing grain. The origins of rice and millet farming date to around 6,000 B.C.E.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-population-growth-in-developing-countries>What happens to population growth in developing countries?</h2>
<p>The demands that the developing economies will place on their agricultural producers from population growth and growth in per capita consumption arising out of higher income will be exceedingly high. Population growth rates are expected to decline substantially in most countries during the first quarter of the next century.</p>
