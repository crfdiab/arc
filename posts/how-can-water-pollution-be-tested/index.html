<h2 id=how-can-water-pollution-be-tested>How can water pollution be tested?</h2>
<p>pH: pH test strips and color disk tests are widely available. More expensive, higher-tech options include electrode-based pH meters. pH is a measure of hydrogen ion activity, which means that it tells us how acidic or basic the water is. pH is not a pollutant, but it is a chemical master variable.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-is-sea-water-tested>How often is sea water tested?</h2>
<p>Beaches monitored and managed under the Bathing Water Quality Regulation are required to be sampled monthly, as a minimum, during the bathing season. However many local authorities sample fortnightly and some even weekly. Sampling at other monitored beaches is generally on a monthly basis during the summer months.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-test-bacteria-for-beach-water>How do you test bacteria for beach water?</h2>
<p>That’s because the standard water-quality test used at beaches around the country takes time. Lab technicians collect a water sample, carry it back to a lab, put it through a filter, place the filter on a Petri dish to grow the bacteria, and incubate the sample at a specific temperature for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The public has been advised not to swim at Seapoint beach in south Co Dublin due to elevated levels of E. coli in the water there. In an advisory notice for Seapoint issued on Friday, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council advised bathers against swimming there for the next five days.</p>
<h2 id=is-bull-island-safe-to-swim-in>Is Bull Island safe to swim in?</h2>
<p>Dublin city council has classified the water quality at Bull Wall as “poor” each time it has been tested from November 11, 2020 to April 7 this year. This means that levels of e-coli and intestinal enterococci, two sewage borne bacteria, were too high to meet the minimum standards for bathing areas.</p>
