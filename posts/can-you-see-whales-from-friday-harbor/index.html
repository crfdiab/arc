<h2 id=can-you-see-whales-from-friday-harbor>Can you see whales from Friday Harbor?</h2>
<p>Friday Harbor There’s also a whale gallery, museum, and gift shop. Friday Harbor is the most populated city or settlement on San Juan Island. There are ample opportunities for chartering a boat here, but because it’s on the east side of the island, you probably won’t catch any glimpses of whales from shore.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-best-place-to-see-orcas-in-washington>Where is the best place to see orcas in Washington?</h2>
<p>San Juan Islands<br>
The San Juan Islands off the coast of northwestern Washington are known for being one of the best places to see orcas in the wild. It’s about a 90-minute drive from Seattle to Anacortes, then a short ferry ride across the sound to Friday Harbor, where many whale-watching outfitters leave on daily excursions.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-adopt-a-killer-whale>How do you adopt a killer whale?</h2>
<p>Adopt an Orca</p>

<li>Most Popular. $60 Orca Adoption Kit. Gift Details.</li>
<li>$60 Orca Virtual Adoption. Donate to WWF in support of our global conservation work and send an optional Orca themed email certificate to your designated recipient.</li>

<h2 id=where-are-orcas-found-in-washington>Where are orcas found in Washington?</h2>
<p>San Juan Island<br>
San Juan Island is considered THE BEST place to view orca whales. Salmon, which are their prime source of food (about 95% of what they eat), travel up and down the west coast of San Juan Island and outlying areas.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-need-a-car-in-friday-harbor>Do I need a car in Friday Harbor?</h2>
<p>There’s no need for a car to see Friday Harbor. Everything is within walking distance of the ferry landing, and it is easy to get around, including shuttle buses and a trolley to take you around the island, as well as bike, three-wheeled Scootcoupe, and moped rentals.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-killer-whales-in-washington-state>Can you see killer whales in Washington state?</h2>
<p>In Washington, they occur in most of the state’s marine waters. Three populations of killer whales, known as the southern residents, transients, and offshores, regularly occur in Washington. Only small portions of both transient and offshore populations normally occur in Washington at any one time.</p>
<h2 id=what-time-of-year-is-best-to-go-whale-watching>What time of year is best to go whale watching?</h2>
<p>Spring is the best time of year to look for FIN WHALES. Fin Whales are the second largest animal in the world and come to our waters to feed on abundant fish and krill, typically arriving in waves that last for several days before subsiding.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-own-an-orca>Can I own an orca?</h2>
<p>There are currently no laws prohibiting the housing of orca whales in captivity; rather laws that specifically allow for the capture of wild orcas for purposes of entertainment and scientific research. The MMPA requires a permit for the taking of a marine mammal, like an orca, from the wild.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-own-a-whale>Can I own a whale?</h2>
<p>All of the great whales are listed as endangered species under the ESA. As a result, it is illegal to kill, hunt, collect, injure or harass them, or to destruct their habitat in any way. It is also illegal to buy or sell any whales.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-orcas-in-washington>Can you see orcas in Washington?</h2>
<p>Magnificent orca (or killer) whales live in the San Juan Islands year-round, and this is the best place in the world to see them in the wild. You can also spot humpbacks, minkes, gray whales, steller sea lions, and many other species of wildlife.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-there-to-do-in-friday-harbor-without-a-car>What is there to do in Friday Harbor without a car?</h2>
<p>Getting around the island without a car can be achieved through the San Juan Island Transit shuttle or the Jolly Trolley. I recommend the shuttle as it’s easy and inexpensive ($5 one way). You can also rent bikes and mopeds at various shops around Friday Harbor or take taxis.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-whale-museum-in-washington-state>Where is the Whale Museum in Washington State?</h2>
<p>The Whale Museum, located in beautiful Friday Harbor, Washington, opened to the public in 1979 as the first museum in the country devoted to a species living in the wild.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-whale-museum-in-friday-harbor-open>When did the Whale Museum in Friday Harbor open?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-the-mission-of-the-whale-museum>What is the mission of the Whale Museum?</h2>
<p>Founded in 1979, The Whale Museum is dedicated to the interpretation of whales in the wild. Its mission is to promote the stewardship of wild whales in the Salish Sea ecosystem through education and research programs.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-help-the-salish-sea-whale-museum>How can I help the Salish Sea whale museum?</h2>
<p>Today, our museum continues to promote stewardship of whales and the Salish Sea ecosystem through education and research. Help support the Southern Resident orcas by making a donation, adopting an orca, or becoming a member of The Whale Museum. Or, simply pay us a visit !</p>
