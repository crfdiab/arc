<h2 id=what-percentage-of-new-zealanders-are-alcoholics>What percentage of New Zealanders are alcoholics?</h2>
<p>One in 10 New Zealanders could now be considered “alcoholic” according to new diagnostic criteria – but the majority of those with a drinking problem are unlikely to recognise it because the issue is so common.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-binge-drink-nz>How many people binge drink NZ?</h2>
<p>Because the survey methods changed, data were recalibrated to ensure comparisons between years was possible. The new results showed that binge drinking prevalence was 34% in 2001, 36% in 2007, 25% in 2012 and 22% in 2019.</p>
<h2 id=is-drinking-a-problem-in-nz>Is drinking a problem in NZ?</h2>
<p>Statistics NZ figures show the drinking habits for more than a third of people aged 18-24 could be potentially hazardous – regularly consuming six more drinks in a single session. During the 2016-2017 financial year, 4070 people were hospitalised due to their alcohol consumption – some more than once.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-affected-by-1-alcoholic>How many people are affected by 1 alcoholic?</h2>
<p>About 2 billion people worldwide consume alcoholic drinks, which can have immediate and long term consequences on health and social life. Over 76 million people are currently affected by alcohol use disorders, such as alcohol dependence and abuse.</p>
<h2 id=what-age-drinks-the-most-alcohol>What age drinks the most alcohol?</h2>
<p>Binge drinking is most common among younger adults aged 18–34 years, but more than half of the total binge drinks are consumed by those aged 35 and older. Binge drinking is twice as common among men than among women.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-deaths-are-caused-by-alcohol-in-new-zealand>How many deaths are caused by alcohol in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>In New Zealand, estimates indicate that between 600 and 1000 people die each year from alcohol-related causes (Berl 2009; Connor et al 2005). More than half of alcohol-related deaths are due to injuries, one-quarter to cancer and one-quarter to other chronic diseases (Connor et al 2005).</p>
<h2 id=who-should-not-drink-alcohol>Who should not drink alcohol?</h2>
<p>The Guidelines note that some people should not drink alcohol at all, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>If they are pregnant or might be pregnant.</li>
<li>If they are under the legal age for drinking.</li>
<li>If they have certain medical conditions or are taking certain medications that can interact with alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-does-alcohol-affect-people-in-new-zealand>How does alcohol affect people in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>New Zealand statistics. These consequences include health conditions and injuries, hospital admissions, deaths, road accidents and assaults. Drinking problems and dependence on alcohol can also affect people’s lives and the lives of those around them.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-standard-drink-in-new-zealand>What is a standard drink in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>What’s a standard drink? Tool – Can you pour a standard drink? What is alcohol? What happens when you drink alcohol? What works?</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-buy-alcohol-in-new-zealand>Where can you buy alcohol in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Today, around 250,000 residents of West Auckland cannot buy alcohol from their supermarkets as off-licence supply is controlled by the Portage and Waitakere Licensing Trusts. No supermarkets in the Invercargill Licensing Trust can sell alcohol. There are almost 1000 bottle stores in New Zealand.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-beer-become-available-in-new-zealand>When did beer become available in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Although beer became available in supermarkets in 1999, there has been a downward trend in the volume of beer sold in New Zealand, from 322.5 million litres in 2008 to 279.9 million litres in 2012. Since then, there appeared to have an increasing trend in the volume of beer available for consumption.</p>
