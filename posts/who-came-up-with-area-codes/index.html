<h2 id=who-came-up-with-area-codes>Who came up with area codes?</h2>
<p>The area code system was developed by AT and Bell Laboratories in the 1940’s, and went into effect in 1947. It was called the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) and included the United States and Canada .</p>
<h2 id=when-did-telephones-get-area-codes>When did telephones get area codes?</h2>
<p>A new nationwide numbering plan was officially published in October 1947 in cooperation of the Bell System with the independent telephone operators. The plan divided most of North America into eighty-six numbering plan areas (NPAs).</p>
<h2 id=who-decided-telephone-country-codes>Who decided telephone country codes?</h2>
<p>the International Telecoms Union<br>
COUNTRY dialling codes were agreed in the early 1960s by the International Telecoms Union (a club of each country’s network providers). In the days of mechanical telephone exchanges, it was convenient to split the world into broad areas: 1 for USA, 2 for Africa, 3 and 4 for Europe, etc.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-they-decide-area-codes>How did they decide area codes?</h2>
<p>The Bell System, formerly a system of companies led by the Bell Telephone Company, created the first area codes back in the 1940s called the North American Numbering Plan. These designated area codes helped automate telephone calls to anywhere across the country without the use of a human operator to connect you.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-uk-44>Why is the UK 44?</h2>
<p>So, the code for the UK isn’t 44. The code actually means 4 for Europe and then 4 for the UK. In the US and Canada, the North American Numbering System was already in place by then. The system was invented to help operators establish calls between 86 different areas.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-still-get-a-310-area-code>Can I still get a 310 area code?</h2>
<p>They’re extremely rare. People can’t get a 310, even a random 310 anymore.” Instead, they’re stuck with LA’s version of 628, 424. “Nobody wants a 424,” Mance said, “especially if they’re in business.” Other popular area codes: 214 (Dallas), 312 (Chicago), 305 (Miami), 404 (Atlanta), 818 (Hollywood), and 626 (Pasadena).</p>
<h2 id=how-are-area-codes-assigned-in-the-north-american-numbering-plan>How are area codes assigned in the North American numbering plan?</h2>
<p>The North American Numbering Plan (NANP) divides the regions of its member nations into geographic numbering plan areas (NPAs). Each area is assigned a three-digit area code which is prefixed to each telephone number issued in its service area. Some areas are assigned multiple codes in an overlay plan .</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-us-area-code-issued>When was the first US area code issued?</h2>
<p>US Area Codes By State. On January 1, 1947, the first North American area codes were issued in regions where standard 7 digit dialing codes were scheduled to be exhaused the soonest. By adding a 3 digit prefix to a 7 digit local number, this allowed for hundreds of millons of new phone numbers to be issued.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-telephone-numbering-plan-work-in-canada>How does the telephone numbering plan work in Canada?</h2>
<p>AT divided the United States and Canada into numbering plan areas (NPAs), and assigned to each NPA a unique three-digit prefix, the numbering plan area code, which became known in short-form as NPA code or simply area code. The area code is prefixed to each telephone number issued in its service area.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-put-your-area-code-in-the-beginning-of-your-phone-number>Do You Put Your Area code in the beginning of your phone number?</h2>
<p>You will add it to the beginning of any phone number you are dialing that’s in the US. When you save your American contacts to your phone, make sure to include this number as part of their phone number! Of course, don’t forget to add the area code, a three-digit number which designates the city you want to connect to, from the list below.</p>
