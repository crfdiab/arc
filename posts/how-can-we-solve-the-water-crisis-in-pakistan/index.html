<h2 id=how-can-we-solve-the-water-crisis-in-pakistan>How can we solve the water crisis in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Helping the Water Crisis in Pakistan In 2018, the Pakistan government called upon both national and international Pakistani to help fund a $14 billion project to build two dams. The goal of the dam is to help Pakistan store more water and to supply the country with electricity.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-solution-of-water>What is the solution of water?</h2>
<p>There are different types of solutions. The one you are probably most familiar with is the aqueous solution. An aqueous solution is a solution in which water is the solvent. A NaCl solution is an aqueous solution.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-pakistan-face-water-crisis>Why does Pakistan face water crisis?</h2>
<p>Population growth, rapid urbanization, water intensive farming practices and industrialization all contribute to Pakistan’s increasing demand for more water. Simultaneously, the supply side is hampered by climatic changes that have made rainfall more erratic, leading to floods in some years and droughts in others.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-4-types-of-solutions>What are the 4 types of solutions?</h2>
<p>Types of Solutions – Solid, Liquid, and Gas</p>
<ul>
<li>Solid – liquid: A solid solute in a liquid solvent. Examples will be salt (solute) dissolved in water (solvent) and sugar (solute) dissolved in water (solvent).</li>
<li>Liquid – liquid: A liquid solute in a liquid solvent.</li>
<li>Gas – liquid: A gas solute in a liquid solvent.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-the-reasons-for-water-shortage-in-villages>What are the reasons for water shortage in villages?</h2>
<p>Villages in India are facing an acute shortage of water for households and agriculture activities with farmers bearing the brunt during cropping season. The agriculture sector, which consumes 80% of India’s water resources and accounts for 90% of the groundwater withdrawals, uses water inefficiently.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-solution-to-the-water-crisis-in-pakistan>Is there a solution to the water crisis in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>We don’t need another mega project to solve our problems. What we need is a mega-vision. There’s a general rhetoric that, one, Pakistan is soon going to run out of water; and, two, building more dams is the ‘only solution’ to the crisis.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-water-shortage-in-pakistan>How big is the water shortage in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>According to the UNO Report, Pakistan is at the 7th position in the list of countries, which are facing water crisis. Presently, Pakistan has a surface water of 153 MAF and underground water resources of only 24 MAF and Pakistan may face water shortage of 33 MAF during the year, 2025. The population of Pakistan is increasing at a rate of 3.2%.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-a-desalination-plant-in-pakistan>Why do we need a desalination plant in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>DEs can help build urban water security in a way that not only every urban dweller, industry, and public utility gets enough clean water for drinking, health, hygiene, and other uses, but also provide sufficient water for horticulture that may be required for the greening and landscaping of public and private areas throughout the cityscapes.</p>
