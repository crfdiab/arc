<h2 id=how-can-amendments-be-proposed-to-the-missouri-constitution>How can amendments be proposed to the Missouri Constitution?</h2>
<p>—Initiative petitions proposing amendments to the constitution shall be signed by eight percent of the legal voters in each of two-thirds of the congressional districts in the state, and petitions proposing laws shall be signed by five percent of such voters.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-methods-are-there-for-proposing-an-amendment>How many methods are there for proposing an amendment?</h2>
<p>The Constitution provides two methods for proposing amendments. While all of the existing amendments have been enacted through the congressional proposal method, in which two-thirds of each House of Congress proposes an amendment, no amendment has ever passed through the convention method.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-get-an-amendment-passed>How do you get an amendment passed?</h2>
<p>The Constitution provides that an amendment may be proposed either by the Congress with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the State legislatures.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-ways-of-proposing-an-amendment-to-the-constitution>What are two ways of proposing an amendment to the Constitution?</h2>
<p>There are two methods: 1 A specific amendment is written and proposed by 2/3 of the Congress. Then the proposed amendment is sent for… 2 A convention for proposing amendments is called for by Congress on application by 2/3 of the states for such a… More …</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-ways-to-ratify-an-amendment>What are two ways to ratify an amendment?</h2>
<p>Under Article V of the Constitution, there are two ways to propose and ratify amendments to the Constitution. To propose amendments, two-thirds of both houses of Congress can vote to propose an amendment, or two-thirds of the state legislatures can ask Congress to call a national convention to propose amendments.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-specific-amendments-written-and-sent-to-the-states>How are specific amendments written and sent to the States?</h2>
<p>Specific amendments are written by the convention and sent to the states for ratification. Even if the proposed amendments come from a convention rather than from Congress, it is Congress which decides whether ratification is to be by state legislatures or state ratifying conventions.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-amend-the-constitution-in-texas>How do you amend the Constitution in Texas?</h2>
<p>Amendments may be proposed in regular sessions of the Texas Legislature or in special sessions. The amendments require a vote of two-thirds of the entire membership in each house for adoption. Joint resolutions are not sent to the governor for approval, but are filed directly with the secretary of state.</p>
