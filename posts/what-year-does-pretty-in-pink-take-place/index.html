<p>The film featured Molly Ringwald as Andie, a high school student whose style belies her working class roots. She’s captured the eye of seemingly every guy in school – among them, preppy dreamboat Blane (Andrew McCarthy) and her little hipster buddy, Duckie (Jon Cryer).</p>

<p>Andrew McCarthy knew immediately after reading the script that the original ending to the Pretty in Pink was going to be a disaster — and he wanted out. In a recent interview with The New Yorker, the actor-director opened up about his time as an ’80s heartthrob who appeared in some of the decade’s most iconic films.</p>

<p>In the film, Molly Ringwald’s working-class character Andie ends up with Andrew McCarthy’s “richie” Blane. However, that wasn’t the intended ending for the film.</p>

<p>John Hughes named the film Pretty In Pink because Molly Ringwald liked The Psychedelic Furs’s song. The movie is named after The Psychedelic Furs’ “Pretty In Pink,” a song Molly Ringwald told Hughes about. (For the movie, the band recorded a poppier version.)</p>

<p>The original ending had Andie ending up with Jon Cryer’s character, Duckie, with the two dancing together at prom. However, in early screenings of the film, the ending didn’t go over well. Director Howard Deutch said, “The movie’s playing like gangbusters. And then it got to the end, the prom, and Jon gets Molly.</p>
