<h2 id=what-to-do-in-lithuanias-capital-city-vilnius>What to do in Lithuania’s capital city Vilnius?</h2>
<p>Lithuania’s capital city has been quietly charming tourists for years, drawing in visitors with the largest baroque Old Town in eastern Europe, then wowing them with an offbeat elegance, a complex history and a cultural scene that’s uniquely Lithuanian. Vilnius under-promises and over-delivers.</p>
