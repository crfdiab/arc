<h2 id=when-did-the-lutheran-church-start-in-australia>When did the Lutheran church start in Australia?</h2>
<p>1838<br>
The Lutheran Church in Australia had begun in 1838 with the arrival of about 500 migrants from Prussia, led by their Pastor, August Kavel.</p>
<h2 id=what-year-did-lutheran-religion-start>What year did Lutheran religion start?</h2>
<p>16th century<br>
Lutheranism as a religious movement originated in the early 16th century Holy Roman Empire as an attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-lutheran-church-start>Why did the Lutheran church start?</h2>
<p>It was founded in the early sixteenth century when a German monk, Martin Luther, protested the Roman Catholic Church’s practice of selling indulgences as part of the penance, or punishment, for those who sinned against church teachings.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-lutheran-church-separate>Why did the Lutheran church separate?</h2>
<p>In 2009 a new Lutheran organization, the North American Lutheran Church, left the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America as the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States. The chief reason for the split was the ELCA’s shift in policy toward homosexual members and clergy.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-lutheran-different-from-christianity>How is Lutheran different from Christianity?</h2>
<p>1) Lutherans are Christians. 3) The Lutheran denomination differs from other Christian sectors primarily in the belief that humans are saved from sins by God’s grace alone (Sola Gratia) through faith alone (Sola Fide).</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-first-lutherans>Who were the first Lutherans?</h2>
<p>Martin Luther founded Lutheranism, a Protestant religious denomination, during the 1500s. Luther was a Catholic monk and professor of theology who resided in Germany.</p>
<h2 id=is-lutheran-the-same-as-catholic>Is Lutheran the same as Catholic?</h2>
<p>Doctrinal Authority: Lutherans believe that only the Holy Scriptures hold authority in determining doctrine; Roman Catholics give doctrinal authority to the Pope, traditions of the church, and the Scriptures. Lutherans also reject many elements of Catholic sacraments such as the doctrine of transubstantiation.</p>
<h2 id=do-lutherans-make-the-sign-of-the-cross>Do Lutherans make the sign of the cross?</h2>
<p>Lutheranism never abandoned the practice of making the sign of the cross in principle and it was commonly retained in worship at least until the early 19th century. Since then, the sign of the cross has become fairly commonplace among Lutherans at worship. The sign of the cross is now customary in the Divine Service.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-martin-luther-remove-7-books-from-the-bible>Why did Martin Luther remove 7 books from the Bible?</h2>
<p>He was determined to make the Bible fit his theology, even if that removing books. From the New Testament, he decided to take out Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation because they didn’t fit his teaching of saved by faith alone without works.</p>
<h2 id=what-religion-is-lutheran-closest-to>What religion is Lutheran closest to?</h2>
<p>The main points of Lutheran theology were summed up in 1530 by Philip Melanchthon in the writing called The Augsburg Confession. Similarities with the Roman Catholic faith include (but are not limited to) liturgy, doctrine of the real presence of the Eucharist, baptism, and Original Sin.</p>
<h2 id=do-lutherans-believe-in-the-virgin-mary>Do Lutherans believe in the Virgin Mary?</h2>
<p>Lutherans believe that the person Jesus is God the Son, the second Person of the Trinity, who was incarnated in the womb of his mother Mary as a human being, and since, as a person, he was “born of the Virgin Mary”. Lutherans have always believed that Mary is the Theotokos, the God-bearer.</p>
<h2 id=do-lutherans-believe-jesus-is-gods-son>Do Lutherans believe Jesus is God’s son?</h2>
<p>In much simpler terms, Lutherans are Christians. First and foremost, Jesus Christ – Christians believe that He is the Son of God, and the Messiah (The Anointed One), who is the fulfillment of God’s love and salvation, as written in the Old Testament of the Bible.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-lutheran-pastor-in-australia>Who was the first Lutheran pastor in Australia?</h2>
<p>There was a transition period in the 1920s and 1930s, and after World War II only English was used. The early Lutheran Church in Australia has unfortunately been marked by division. The first pastors, August Kavel and G D Fritzsche, disagreed on a number of matters and in 1846 they established separate churches.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-lutheran-churches-are-there-in-australia>How many Lutheran churches are there in Australia?</h2>
<p>Victoria established its own church and Queensland had two Lutheran churches. As a result, in the early 1900s, there were eight separate Lutheran churches, plus some independent Lutheran pastors. In the 20th century efforts were made to bring unity and in 1921 five churches joined together. Another one joined in 1926.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-lutherans-move-to-in-australia>Where did the Lutherans move to in Australia?</h2>
<p>In the 1860s, Lutheran families moved from South Australia to the southern region of New South Wales as land became available for selection. As a result, the Riverina became the main area for the Lutheran Church in New South Wales. German migration to Queensland began in large numbers in the 1860s.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-german-lutherans-come-to-victoria>When did the German Lutherans come to Victoria?</h2>
<p>German Lutherans also came to Victoria from the 1840s onwards and established the Lutheran Church in the Melbourne district. Some Germans moved from South Australia to Victoria, first to the Hamilton district in the 1850s and then to the Wimmera in the 1860s and 1870s.</p>
