<h2 id=when-did-native-americans-first-have-dogs>When did Native Americans first have dogs?</h2>
<p>Origins. The Earliest evidence for dogs in the Americas can be found in Danger Cave, Utah, a site dated between 9,000 and 10,000 years BP (Before Present) Dogs descended from Eurasian Grey Wolves.</p>
<h2 id=what-animal-did-the-native-american-indian-domesticate>What animal did the Native American Indian domesticate?</h2>
<p>The only domesticated species in the Americas were the dog, turkey, guinea pig and two Andean camelids [1] .</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-dog-in-america>What was the first dog in America?</h2>
<p>The earliest probable dog remains found in North America are about 8700 to 14 000 years old. These dogs were medium-sized and likely used in hunting. Dogs of this time-period and region are not very common. 8700 to 9300 year-old remains were found in Wyoming, U.S.A., at the Horner site.</p>
<h2 id=did-american-indians-domesticate-wolves>Did American Indians domesticate wolves?</h2>
<p>The one exception was wolves, which the Indians domesticated into dogs. Likely about knee-high and with an average weight of twenty pounds, these animals were not specialized or even especially tame, and were used only in hunting land fowl such as wild turkey.</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-did-native-americans-not-domesticate>What animals did Native Americans not domesticate?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the Americas simply had fewer species of large mammals that could be tamed. There were, for instance, no wild horses or cattle in the Americas to tame. What about North American buffalo? They resisted and still resist domestication.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-the-most-dogs>Which country has the most dogs?</h2>

<h2 id=usa-758-million-who-first-brought-dogs-to-america>USA (75.8 million) Who first brought dogs to America?</h2>
<p>History. Some of the earliest archaeological traces of the existence of dogs in the United States can be dated back to 9,000 b.p. Dogs came to America after crossing from Siberia to Alaska, and it was during this period that the domestication of dogs began in America.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-domesticated-dog-in-the-world>What was the first domesticated dog in the world?</h2>
<p>Bonn-Oberkassel dog<br>
The archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the Bonn-Oberkassel dog buried beside humans 14,200 years ago to be the first undisputed dog, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=is-native-american-indian-dog-a-real-breed>Is Native American Indian dog a real breed?</h2>
<p>The Native American Indian Dog is a rare breed known for its long, pointy ears, thick coat, intense stare, and impressive build. According to K9 Web, they’re generally strong, intelligent, and reliable working dogs. Their loyal, friendly demeanor and hypoallergenic coat also tend to make them ideal family pets.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-such-thing-as-a-native-american-dog>Is there such thing as a Native American dog?</h2>
<p>Whether the true Native American dog (also called the Plains Indian dog or Navajo dog) still exists is in dispute. Many Native Americans contend that the breed has wholly ceased to exist, in spite of attempts to re-establish the breed.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-dogs-important-to-the-american-indians>Why are dogs important to the American Indians?</h2>
<p>Dogs weren’t just pets, but members of the tribe and they were known and loved by tribe people as one loves a coworker, a friend, or a family member. It was believed that dogs could see the dead and portend the future.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-native-american-domestic-animal>What was the first Native American domestic animal?</h2>
<p>Dogs were Native American’s first domesticated animal thousands of years before the arrival of the European horse. It is estimated that there were more than 300,000 domesticated dogs in America when the first European explorers arrived.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-native-american-dog-become-extinct>When did the Native American dog become extinct?</h2>
<p>Arriving about 10,000 years ago, they are now almost completely extinct except for a small handful of breeds such as Chihuahuas, Alaskan Malamutes, Greenland Dogs, and possibly the Carolina Dog .</p>
