<h2 id=are-there-armadillos-in-the-south>Are there armadillos in the South?</h2>
<p>Armadillos weigh 8 to 17 pounds. Armadillos range from Texas to southeast New Mexico, through Oklahoma, southeast Kansas, southwest Missouri, Arkansas, and southwest Mississippi. Their range includes central Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, and has extended northward in recent times.</p>
<h2 id=what-states-are-armadillos-found-in>What states are armadillos found in?</h2>
<p>Nine-banded armadillos are found in the southeastern United States, but their range has been expanding continually northward for more than a hundred years. A few have even been spotted as far north as Illinois and Nebraska.</p>
<h2 id=what-city-has-armadillos>What city has armadillos?</h2>

Armadillo – City of Arlington.</p>
<h2 id=do-armadillos-carry-disease>Do armadillos carry disease?</h2>
<p>In the southern United States, some armadillos are naturally infected with the bacteria that cause Hansen’s disease in people and it may be possible that they can spread it to people. However, the risk is very low and most people who come into contact with armadillos are unlikely to get Hansen’s disease.</p>
<h2 id=what-kills-an-armadillo>What kills an armadillo?</h2>
<p>Your best bet to kill an armadillo is by shooting it with a gun, if it is legal to do so in your area. You can also set lethal body-grip traps, but these are hard to find, and even harder to set properly, and are dangerous.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-pick-up-an-armadillo>Is it safe to pick up an armadillo?</h2>
<p>Those animals will bite and scratch with conviction and good aim if you try to pick one of them up. But armadillos, like possums, are manageable. I have caught both by running after them, grabbing the long tail, and lifting them off the ground. Nonetheless catching an armadillo could have an unpleasant outcome.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-giant-armadillos-live-in-south-america>Where do giant armadillos live in South America?</h2>
<p>The giant armadillo is native to the northern half of South America. It lives in the tropical forests of northeastern South America. They can be also found along the northern coast of America. Giant armadillos can live and survive above sea level at an altitude of 500 meters. Besides that, they are solitary animals and not territorial.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-find-a-six-banded-armadillo>Where can you find a six banded armadillo?</h2>
<p>The six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus), also known as the yellow armadillo, is an armadillo found in South America.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-an-armadillo-get-its-name-from>Where does an armadillo get its name from?</h2>
<p>Armadillos are leathery little animals that live in North, Central, and South America. Though they seem scaled, like a reptile, armadillos are actually mammals. They are warm-blooded, have hair, give live birth, and nurse their babies with milk. Their name comes from their thick leathery skin, and means “little armored one” in Spanish.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-species-of-armadillo-are-there-in-the-world>How many species of armadillo are there in the world?</h2>
<p>How many species of armadillo are there? There are currently more than 20 living species of armadillos in the world, most of them located in South America. However, dozens more extinct species have been documented from the fossil record.</p>
