<h2 id=is-water-renewable-yes-or-no>Is water renewable yes or no?</h2>
<p>Common sources of renewable energy include solar, geothermal and wind power, which are all categorized as renewable resources. Fresh water is an example of renewable resources.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-water-both-renewable-and-nonrenewable>Why is water both renewable and nonrenewable?</h2>
<p>Complete answer: Water is a renewable and non-renewable resource because of the water cycle which is a natural process that replenishes water on earth in a periodic manner. This is why water can also be termed as non-renewable and water conservation is very crucial.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-ground-water-an-example-of-a-renewable-resource>How is ground water an example of a renewable resource?</h2>
<p>Ground water is an example of renewable resource because it is replenished by nature, for example by rain.However, if we use more than what is being replenished by rain then we would be overusing the resource and this may lead to the exhaustion of groundwater after a period of time and thereby becoming a non-renewable resource.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-non-renewable-source-of-energy>Which is a non-renewable source of energy?</h2>
<p>For environmentalists, mega-dam hydroelectric projects are harmful to the animals and plants living in or around rivers. In their view, hydropower is a non-renewable energy except on microscales.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-greenest-way-to-create-energy>Which is the greenest way to create energy?</h2>
<p>One of the greenest ways it’s created is by a chemical process extracting it from water. All forms of renewable energy are also referred to as alternative energy. These clean (or green) types of energy have no significant undesirable consequences. They offer a choice compared to conventional, “ dirty ” forms of energy that are non-renewable.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-water-a-natural-resource-in-the-universe>How is water a natural resource in the universe?</h2>
<p>The universe is largely endowed with this natural resource called water. Water is a resource that has been there since way back to the origins of the universe. It falls from the sky in the form of rain and then rushes down on our riverbeds and also forms the beautiful water bodies like oceans and lakes.</p>
