<h2 id=did-greece-surrender-to-germany>Did Greece surrender to Germany?</h2>
<p>German landings on the island of Crete (May 1941) came after Allied forces had been defeated in mainland Greece….Battle of Greece.</p>
<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>28 October 1940 or 6 April 1941 – 23 April 1941 or 1 June 1941</th></tr><tr><td>Result</td><td>Axis victory</td></tr><tr><td>Territorial changes</td><td>Axis occupation of Greece Start of the Greek Resistance</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-did-germany-attack-greece>Why did Germany attack Greece?</h2>
<p>On 6 April 1941, the German Army, supported by Hungarian and Bulgarian forces, attacked Yugoslavia and Greece. Hitler launched the assault in order to overthrow the recently established pro-Allied government in Yugoslavia and to support the stalling Italian invasion of Greece (launched in October 1940).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-italy-attack-greece>Why did Italy attack Greece?</h2>
<p>Mussolini wanted to believe that they were on an equal footing. However, Hitler launched several campaigns without first informing him. Since England supported Greece, Mussolini believed that the British controlled these ports. If he were to attack and then occupy Greece, Italy would have control of these ports.</p>
<h2 id=did-greece-fight-in-ww1>Did Greece fight in ww1?</h2>
<p>On July 2, 1917, several weeks after King Constantine I abdicates his throne in Athens under pressure from the Allies, Greece declares war on the Central Powers, ending three years of neutrality by entering World War I alongside Britain, France, Russia and Italy.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-visit-italy-from-greece>Can you visit Italy from Greece?</h2>
<p>Italy permits entry to most European countries, more precisely to Austria, Andorra, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Poland, Czech Republic.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-greece-fight-in-world-war-1>Where did Greece fight in World War 1?</h2>
<p>Nonetheless, in October 1914 Greek forces once more occupied Northern Epirus, from where they had retreated after the end of the Balkan Wars.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-situation-in-greece-in-1914>What was the situation in Greece in 1914?</h2>
<p>In 1914 both the Triple Entente and the Central Powers, tried to form alliances in the Balkans. Both alliances promised privileges to any country that took their side. Eventually, Serbia allied with the Triple Entente while Bulgaria and Turkey preferred the Central Powers. In Greece, the situation was rather complicated.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-greece-stay-stable-during-world-war-1>How did Greece stay stable during World War 1?</h2>
<p>The Macedonian Front stayed mostly stable throughout the war. In May 1918, Greek forces attacked Bulgarian forces and defeated them at the Battle of Skra-di-Legen on 30 May 1918. Later in 1918, the Allied forces drove their offensive from Greece into occupied Serbia.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-greek-prime-minister-during-world-war-1>Who was the Greek prime minister during World War 1?</h2>
<p>The breach between the two became irrevocable when Venizélos in October 1916 established a rival government in Thessaloníki, which, like most of “New Greece,” was passionately loyal to Venizélos. In June 1917 the entente allies ousted King Constantine and installed Venizélos as prime minister of a formally united but bitterly divided Greece.</p>
