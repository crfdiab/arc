<h2 id=how-long-can-a-person-with-bloom-syndrome-live>How long can a person with Bloom syndrome live?</h2>
<p>There are fewer than 200 known surviving cases of Bloom syndrome worldwide. Lifespan is limited; the average age of death is 27 years….Edit This Favorite.</p>
<table><tr><th></th><th>Edit This Favorite</th></tr><tr><td>Category:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Share:</td><td>Yes No, Keep Private</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=is-bloom-syndrome-fatal>Is Bloom syndrome fatal?</h2>
<p>The average life span is approximately 27 years. The most common cause of death in Bloom syndrome is from cancer. Other complications of the disorder include chronic obstructive lung disease and type 2 diabetes. There are a variety of excellent sources for more detailed clinical information about Bloom syndrome.</p>
<h2 id=is-bloom-syndrome-more-common-in-males-or-females>Is Bloom syndrome more common in males or females?</h2>
<p>Bloom syndrome is more common in eastern European Ashkenazi Jews. At least 1 in 100 Ashkenazi Jews is a carrier of the disease. It appears to be slightly more common in males than females.</p>
<h2 id=which-genetic-disorder-is-the-rarest>Which genetic disorder is the rarest?</h2>
<p>According to the Journal of Molecular Medicine, Ribose-5 phosphate isomerase deficiency, or RPI Deficinecy, is the rarest disease in the world with MRI and DNA analysis providing only one case in history.</p>
<h2 id=does-bloom-syndrome-have-a-cure>Does Bloom syndrome have a cure?</h2>
<p>Although there is currently no treatment aimed at the underlying genetic abnormality, persons with Bloom’s syndrome benefit from sun protection, aggressive treatment of infections, surveillance for insulin resistance, and early identification of cancer.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-watsons-disease>What is Watson’s disease?</h2>
<p>Watson syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by the presence of pulmonary valvular stenosis, cafe au lait spots, and mild mental retardation. These features are also sometimes observed in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). It has been suggested that Watson syndrome is caused by mutations in NF1 gene.</p>

<p>San Diego Child Only Known Person In World With This Rare Form Of Disease. Above: Eleven year old Damien Omler has a rare disease known as CDG. But he is the only known person in the world with a specific mutation, March 4, 2020.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-charlie-syndrome>What is Charlie syndrome?</h2>
<p>Charlie M syndrome is a rare bone developmental disorder which belongs to a group of oromandibular limb hypogenesis syndromes that includes hypoglossia-hypodactyly and glossopalatine ankylosis (see these terms).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-kindler-syndrome>What is Kindler syndrome?</h2>
<p>Kindler syndrome is a rare type of epidermolysis bullosa, which is a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. From early infancy, people with Kindler syndrome have skin blistering, particularly on the backs of the hands and the tops of the feet.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-do-people-with-bloom-syndrome-get>How tall do people with Bloom syndrome get?</h2>
<p>People with Bloom syndrome are usually smaller than 97 percent of the population in both height and weight from birth, and they rarely exceed 5 feet tall in adulthood. Affected individuals have skin that is sensitive to sun exposure, and they usually develop a butterfly-shaped patch of reddened skin across the nose and cheeks.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-cancer-can-you-get-with-bloom-syndrome>What kind of cancer can you get with Bloom syndrome?</h2>
<p>People with Bloom syndrome have an increased risk of cancer. They can develop any type of cancer, but the cancers arise earlier in life than they do in the general population, and affected individuals often develop more than one type of cancer.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-percentage-of-people-that-have-blue-eyes>What’s the percentage of people that have blue eyes?</h2>
<p>Only between 8% and 10% of humans can boast having blue eyes, however. Interestingly, a genetic mutation thought to have occurred between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago is said to be the origin of this eye color. The mutation resulted in a “switch” that turned off the genetic mechanism for brown eyes.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-bloom-syndrome-inherited-in-autosomal-recessive-pattern>How is Bloom syndrome inherited in autosomal recessive pattern?</h2>
<p>Genetic changes that allow cells to divide in an uncontrolled way lead to the cancers that occur in people with Bloom syndrome. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.</p>
