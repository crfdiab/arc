<h2 id=when-did-george-mason-refuse-to-sign-the-constitution>When did George Mason refuse to sign the Constitution?</h2>
<p>1787<br>
George Mason IV (December 11, 1725 [O.S. November 30, 1725] – October 7, 1792) was an American planter, politician and delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787, one of three delegates who refused to sign the Constitution….</p>

<h2 id=did-george-washington-sign-the-constitution-why-or-why-not>Did George Washington sign the Constitution Why or why not?</h2>
<p>George Washington signed the Constitution of the United States on September 17, 1787 at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A crucial force in this process, Washington’s careful mediation helped facilitate an atmosphere which allowed for the compromises necessary to create this bold, new government.</p>
<h2 id=did-george-mason-sign-the-constitution-and-why>Did George Mason sign the Constitution and why?</h2>
<p>As a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, Mason refused to sign the Constitution and lobbied against its ratification in his home state, believing the document as drafted gave too much power to a central government and was incomplete absent a bill of rights to guarantee individual liberty.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-framer-who-refused-to-sign-the-constitution>Who was the framer who refused to sign the Constitution?</h2>
<p>George Mason, the Framer Who Refused to Sign the Constitution. The concepts look familiar because Thomas Jefferson eloquently incorporated them in the second paragraph of our Declaration of Independence. Therein lies the rub. George Mason’s primary objection to the Constitution was the absence of a bill of rights.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-gerry-and-mason-refuse-to-sign-the-constitution>Why did Gerry and Mason refuse to sign the Constitution?</h2>
<p>No convention convinced of the necessity of the plan will refuse to give it effect, on the adoption by nine States. He thought this mode less exceptionable than the one proposed in the article: while it would attain the same end.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-king-refuse-to-sign-the-constitution>Why did king refuse to sign the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Mr. KING [6] thought it would be more respectful to Congress, to submit the plan generally to them than in such a form as expressly and necessarily to require their approbation or disapprobation.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-randolph-refuse-to-sign-the-constitution>Why did Randolph refuse to sign the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Randolph went further, declaring that the Constitution should give the state ratifying conventions the power to propose amendments. Later in that day’s discussion, Randolph revealed a lengthy series of complaints against what he considered inadequate provisions for limiting the power of the executive and the legislature.</p>
