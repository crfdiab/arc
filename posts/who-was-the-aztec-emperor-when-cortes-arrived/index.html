<h2 id=who-was-the-aztec-emperor-when-cortes-arrived>Who was the Aztec emperor when Cortes arrived?</h2>
<p>Moctezuma II<br>
Cortés landed his expedition force on the coast of the modern day state of Veracruz in April 1519. During this same period, soon after he arrived, Cortés was welcomed by representatives of the Aztec Emperor, Moctezuma II.</p>
<h2 id=who-explored-with-hernán-cortés>Who explored with Hernán Cortés?</h2>
<p>Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar<br>
In 1504, Cortés left Spain to seek his fortune in New World. He traveled to the island of Santo Domingo, or Hispaniola. Settling in the new town of Azúa, Cortés served as a notary for several years. He joined an expedition of Cuba led by Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar in 1511.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-aztec-leader-that-cortes-kidnaps>Who is the Aztec leader that Cortes kidnaps?</h2>
<p>Hernán Cortés<br>
After a three-month siege, Spanish forces under Hernán Cortés capture Tenochtitlán, the capital of the Aztec empire. Cortés’ men leveled the city and captured Cuauhtémoc, the Aztec emperor.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-aztec-woman-who-helped-cortes>Who was the Aztec woman who helped Cortes?</h2>
<p>La Malinche<br>
Marina [maˈɾina] or Malintzin [maˈlintsin] (c. 1500 – c. 1529), more popularly known as La Malinche [la maˈlintʃe], was a Nahua woman from the Mexican Gulf Coast known for contributing to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, by acting as an interpreter, advisor, and intermediary for the Spanish conquistador Hernán …</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-aztecs-when-hernan-cortes-arrived>Who was the leader of the Aztecs when Hernan Cortes arrived?</h2>
<p>Cortés had heard of the Aztecs and knew that they, and their leader Montezuma II, were a primary force in Mexico. “He arrived in the great Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán in 1519,” said Cosme. “Although he was kindly received by the Aztec emperor Montezuma, Cortés’ intentions were less benevolent.” He set out to rule them.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-descendants-of-hernan-cortes-and-moctezuma>Who are the descendants of Hernan Cortes and Moctezuma?</h2>
<p>Descendants of Aztec emperor Moctezuma II and Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés met in Mexico City on Friday to mark the 500th anniversary of their ancestors’ first meeting.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-cortes-find-when-he-met-montezuma>What did Cortes find when he met Montezuma?</h2>
<p>Upon meeting the Aztec ruler Montezuma II and discovering the capital, Tenochtitlán, Cortés and his men were in awe. They had never seen a city as grand or a culture as drastically different from their own.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-hernan-cortes-related-to-francisco-pizarro>How is Hernan Cortes related to Francisco Pizarro?</h2>
<p>Through his mother, Hernán was second cousin once removed of Francisco Pizarro, who later conquered the Inca Empire of modern-day Peru, and not to be confused with another Francisco Pizarro, who joined Cortés to conquer the Aztecs.</p>
