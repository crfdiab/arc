<h2 id=what-was-italy-before-ww2>What was Italy before ww2?</h2>
<p>The Kingdom of Italy (Italian: Regno d’Italia) was a state that existed from 1861—when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy—until 1946, when civil discontent led an institutional referendum to abandon the monarchy and form the modern Italian Republic.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-did-italy-conquer-before-ww2>What countries did Italy conquer before ww2?</h2>
<p>Former colonies, protectorates and occupied areas</p>
<ul>
<li>Italian Eritrea (1882–1936)</li>
<li>Italian Somalia (1889–1936)</li>
<li>Libya (1911–1943)</li>
<li>Italian East Africa (1936–1941)</li>
<li>Italian Albania (1918–1920)</li>
<li>Italian Albania (1939–1943)</li>
<li>Italian Islands of the Aegean (1912–1947)</li>
<li>Italian concession of Tientsin (1901–1943)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=who-did-italy-invade-before-ww2>Who did Italy invade before ww2?</h2>
<p>A border incident between Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland that December gave Benito Mussolini an excuse to intervene. Rejecting all arbitration offers, the Italians invaded Ethiopia on October 3, 1935.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-religion-in-italy-during-ww2>What was the main religion in Italy during ww2?</h2>
<p>Another part of the treaty was called the Concordat. This made the Roman Catholic faith the state religion – this was a fait accompli anyway.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-italy-join-germany-in-world-war-2>When did Italy join Germany in World War 2?</h2>
<p>Only in June 1940, when France was about to fall and World War II seemed virtually over, did Italy join the war on Germany’s side, still hoping for territorial spoils. Mussolini announced his decision—one bitterly opposed by his foreign minister, Galeazzo Ciano —to huge crowds across Italy on June 10.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-italy-not-fight-in-world-war-2>Why did Italy not fight in World War 2?</h2>
<p>In all, nearly 85,000 Italian troops failed to make it home from Russia. In short, the war was an almost unrelieved succession of military disasters. Poor generals and low morale contributed much to this outcome—the Italian conscripts were fighting far from home for causes in which few of them believed.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-italy-invade-yugoslavia-in-world-war-2>Why did Italy invade Yugoslavia in World War 2?</h2>
<p>Italy joined in on both invasions, as Mussolini struggled not to be relegated to the position of Hitler’s junior partner. Within two weeks, Yugoslavia surrendered, the Italians having played their now familiar small part.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-italian-empire-collapse-in-world-war-2>When did the Italian empire collapse in World War 2?</h2>
<p>Ultimately the Italian empire collapsed after disastrous defeats in the Eastern European and North African campaigns. In July 1943, following the Allied invasion of Sicily, Mussolini was arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III, provoking a civil war.</p>
