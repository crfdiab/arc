<h2 id=what-part-of-mexico-are-chihuahuas-from>What part of Mexico are Chihuahuas from?</h2>
<p>Chihuahua, estado (state), northern Mexico. It is bounded to the north and northeast by the United States (New Mexico and Texas), to the east by the state of Coahuila, to the south by the state of Durango, and to the west by the states of Sinaloa and Sonora. Its capital is the city of Chihuahua.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-breeds-make-a-chihuahua>What two breeds make a Chihuahua?</h2>
<p>While many historians believe the Chihuahua is a descendant of the Techichi, others believe it’s a cross between the Techichi and a small hairless dog known as the Chinese Crested. If you’re familiar with the World’s Ugliest Dog Competition, you’ve probably heard of this breed before.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-prevent-health-problems-in-chihuahuas>Is it possible to prevent health problems in Chihuahuas?</h2>
<p>Of course you can’t prevent some of the health problems your dog develops, but you can prevent or treat many of them. And overall, chihuahuas are healthy little dogs and they have the longest lifespans of all dog breeds. This was a guest post by Cathy Bendzunas!</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-weather-like-in-chihuahua-mexico>What’s the weather like in Chihuahua, Mexico?</h2>
<p>Weather – Mexico’s biggest state has many weather variations. The hottest months in Chihuahua are from April to October, the coolest months are between November and December. Precipitation may be expected from June to early October. Airports – Chihuahua has one International Airport – General Roberto Fierro Villalobos International Airport.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-disease-does-a-chihuahua-have>What kind of disease does a Chihuahua have?</h2>
<p>It is a hereditary disease that usually starts to present about four months after a puppy is born. A Chihuahua with a luxating patella may limp or avoid using the affected leg completely. If it affects your dog’s hind legs, you may notice him/her holding their hind legs in the air for several minutes at a time.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-travel-as-a-tourist-in-chihuahua>Is it safe to travel as a tourist in Chihuahua?</h2>
<p>Most tourists are safe and protected with hard armed police. But however, you should be more alert than usual here. In the city, a traveler can use taxis services and buses. As well as getting around town, or go to the airport or train station. If you want to find a taxi – choose a car with a sign-on roof or sides.</p>
