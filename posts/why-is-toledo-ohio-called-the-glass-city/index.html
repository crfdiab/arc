<p>The first of many glass manufacturers arrived in the 1880s, eventually earning Toledo its nickname: “The Glass City.” It has since become a city with a distinctive and growing art community, auto assembly businesses, education, thriving healthcare, and well-supported local sports teams.</p>
<h2 id=why-live-in-toledo-ohio>Why live in Toledo Ohio?</h2>
<p>Many families and retirees call Toledo home. A number of factors make the Toledo area an attractive place for families, one being the high quality of schools. The area also has kid-friendly events and activities, such as the hands-on Imagination Station science museum, located downtown.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-richest-person-in-toledo-ohio>Who is the richest person in Toledo Ohio?</h2>
<p>Harold McMaster<br>
The latest issue of Worth magazine lists Harold McMaster as the Toledo area’s richest person, with a net worth of $400 million, but the entrepreneur, inventor, and philanthropist disputes it.</p>
<h2 id=how-safe-is-toledo>How safe is Toledo?</h2>
<p>With a crime rate of 45 per one thousand residents, Toledo has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes – from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. One’s chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in 22.</p>
<h2 id=what-holy-toledo-means>What Holy Toledo means?</h2>
<p>Filters. An exclamation of surprise or astonishment. interjection.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-stranahans-make-their-home-in-toledo>Where did the Stranahans make their home in Toledo?</h2>
<p>The deal came with the stipulation that the Stranahans must make Toledo their home, the same city Willys-Overland called home. About two years later, Ford Motor Company, under the direction of its founder Henry Ford, offered up a similar contract.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-ra-and-fdstranahan-live>Where did R.A and f.d.stranahan live?</h2>
<p>For the most part, this story starts in 1910 when R.A and his brother F.D. Stranahan left their Boston roots and steered for Toledo, Ohio. Neither the Stranahans nor Toledo would ever be the same.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-stranahan-estate-in-sylvania-located>Where was the Stranahan Estate in Sylvania located?</h2>
<p>Development of the estate began in 1936, and the plot of land itself was once much larger. Stranahan donated land to the Sylvania City School district for Stranahan Elementary School on Holland-Sylvania Road (which I attended for a grade and a half), and there was the Chatham Valley subdivision built off Corey Road.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-thomas-devilbiss-buy-the-stranahan-estate>When did Thomas DeVilbiss buy the Stranahan Estate?</h2>
<p>Stranahan bought it from another Toledo industrialist, Thomas A. DeVilbiss. Development of the estate began in 1936, and the plot of land itself was once much larger.</p>
