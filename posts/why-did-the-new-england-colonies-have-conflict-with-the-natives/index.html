<h2 id=why-did-the-new-england-colonies-have-conflict-with-the-natives>Why did the New England colonies have conflict with the natives?</h2>
<p>They hoped to transform the tribes people into civilized Christians through their daily contacts. The Native Americans resented and resisted the colonists’ attempts to change them. Their refusal to conform to European culture angered the colonists and hostilities soon broke out between the two groups.</p>
<h2 id=did-new-england-get-along-with-natives>Did New England get along with natives?</h2>
<p>While Native Americans and English settlers in the New England territories first attempted a mutual relationship based on trade and a shared dedication to spirituality, soon disease and other conflicts led to a deteriorated relationship and, eventually, the First Indian War.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-new-england-experience-wars-with-native-americans-in-the-seventeenth-century-such-as-the-pequot-war-and-king-philips-war-what-were-these-wars-like-what-was-the-impact-on-both-english-and-native-peoples>Why did New England experience wars with Native Americans in the seventeenth century such as the Pequot War and King Philip’s War What were these wars like what was the impact on both English and native peoples?</h2>
<p>King Philip’s War—also known as the First Indian War, the Great Narragansett War or Metacom’s Rebellion—took place in southern New England from 1675 to 1676. It was the Native Americans’ last-ditch effort to avoid recognizing English authority and stop English settlement on their native lands.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-puritans-start-fighting-with-the-indians>When did the Puritans start fighting with the Indians?</h2>
<p>The first major conflict between the Puritans and Indians began in 1636. The Pequots, the most powerful of those living in the Connecticut Valley, looked with suspicion and alarm as the number of English settlers beginning to inhabit their land increased.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-puritans-settle-in-north-america>Where did the Puritans settle in North America?</h2>
<p>There, on deserted Indian Territory, they established their colonial settlement known as the Plymouth Plantation (Foner 66). For the most part, it was very difficult to “establish a permanent English settlement on the North American continent” (Philbrick 5).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-of-the-new-england-colonies>What was the religion of the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>The primary religion of the New England colonies was the strict Puritan Christianity originally brought to the Massachusetts Bay colony by ships like the Mayflower, but as the colonies grew and changed, some of the colonists began to move away from that base. So too did views on the Native Americans who shared their land.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-pequot-war-do-to-new-england>What did the Pequot War do to New England?</h2>
<p>The Pequot War was the first big conflict between colonizers and tribes in New England. Hauptman said the war established English domination over the Pequot and permanently ruled out any chances of living peacefully together. Today, some scholars—Hauptman among them—say the English committed genocide.</p>
