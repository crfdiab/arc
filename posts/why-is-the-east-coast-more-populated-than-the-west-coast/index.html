<h2 id=why-is-the-east-coast-more-populated-than-the-west-coast>Why is the East Coast more populated than the west coast?</h2>
<p>Why is the East Coast more populated than the west coast? The US started with the original 13 states on the east coast. Therefore, the cities on the east coast are older than the ones on the west coast so they had a head start in terms of population growth through births.</p>
<h2 id=do-more-people-live-on-the-east-coast-than-the-west>Do more people live on the East Coast than the West?</h2>
<p>The contain approximately 51 million people. The east coast has more than double the population of the west coast. Together the two coasts contain nearly half the population of this nation. If you were to look at a map of the United States, you would see that more cities are on the eastern third or so of the nation.</p>
<h2 id=do-most-people-live-on-the-east-coast>Do most people live on the East Coast?</h2>
<p>New York City is the largest city on the East Coast, with a population of over 8.6 million inhabitants. New York City is also the most populous city in the nation. Other most populated cities in this region include Charlotte, North Carolina, and Jacksonville, Florida….East Coast States 2021.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-most-concentrated-region-in-the-united-states>What is the most concentrated region in the United States?</h2>
<p>As has been the case historically, the most densely populated parts of the United States are east of the Mississippi River. Rings of decreasing population density radiate out from the major urban centers of New York, Philadelphia, and Washington along the East Coast.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-east-coast-better-than-the-west-coast>What makes the east coast better than the west coast?</h2>
<p>One thing the east coast has that the west coast doesn’t is more states. The states on the west coast are bigger and more spread out. The states on the east coast are smaller and more compact. At first, this may sound like a bad thing, but that means you can travel to these areas quicker and see many different things on your journey.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-mississippi-river-flood-affect-the-east-coast>Why did the Mississippi River flood affect the east coast?</h2>
<p>They changed the course of the Mississippi River, created a vast area of ground deformation and liquefaction features; and they were felt widely along the east coast of the U.S. 800 to 1000 miles away. Because the surrounding area was mostly undeveloped at the time, few deaths were reported and these events stirred relatively little attention then.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-more-common-in-the-east-than-the-west>Which is more common in the east than the west?</h2>
<p>Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Shenism, Taoism, and Islam are some common religions practiced in the Eastern world. The population in Eastern countries is more traditional than people in the West when we consider their clothing, rituals, and so on.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-the-midwest-and-the-south>What’s the difference between the Midwest and the south?</h2>
<p>Although the American South was certainly more unique in my eyes, to me, the differences between the East Coast and the Midwest seemed minimal at best.</p>
