<h2 id=how-environmental-policies-can-be-integrated>How environmental policies can be integrated?</h2>
<p>Environmental policy integration (EPI) is the process of placing environmental considerations at the heart of decision-making in other sectoral policies, such as energy and agriculture, rather than leaving them to be pursued separately through purely environmental policy instruments.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-policy-making-in-environmental-issues>What is the role of policy making in environmental issues?</h2>
<p>There are several instruments that aim to inform decision makers about the environmental effects of their actions. Such standards help an organization control its environmental impact, formulate and monitor environmental objectives, and demonstrate that they have been achieved.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-examples-of-environmental-policies>What are examples of environmental policies?</h2>
<p>Environmental policy can include laws and policies addressing water and air pollution, chemical and oil spills, smog, drinking water quality, land conservation and management, and wildlife protection, such as the protection of endangered species.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-examples-of-environmental-issues-that-can-be-addressed-through-policy>What are two examples of environmental issues that can be addressed through policy?</h2>
<p>Environmental policy issues include water and air pollution, chemical and oil spills, smog, drinking water quality, land conservation and management, and wildlife protection, including the protection of endangered species.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-function-of-environmental-policy-a>What is the main function of environmental policy a?</h2>
<p>The main function of environmental policy is to, through government action, minimize the environmental impact of businesses and society.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-function-of-environmental-laws-and-policies>What is the main function of environmental laws and policies?</h2>
<p>The purpose of environmental law is to protect the environment and create rules for how people can use natural resources. Environmental laws not only aim to protect the environment from harm, but they also determine who can use natural resources and on what terms.</p>

<hr>
<p>The concept of environmental policy integration (EPI) refers to the process of integrating environmental objectives into non-environmental policy areas, such as energy, agriculture and transport, rather than leaving them to be pursued solely through purely environmental policy practices.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-way-to-describe-environmental-policy>Which is the best way to describe environmental policy?</h2>
<p>One way is to describe environmental policy is that it comprises two major terms: environment and policy. Environment refers to the physical ecosystems, but can also take into consideration the social dimension (quality of life, health) and an economic dimension (resource management, biodiversity).</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-need-multiple-environmental-policy-instruments>Why do we need multiple environmental policy instruments?</h2>
<p>Since environmental issues have many aspects, several policy instruments may be needed to adequately address each one. Furthermore, a combination of different policies may give firms greater flexibility in policy compliance and reduce uncertainty as to the cost of such compliance.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-solve-the-environmental-issue>What’s the best way to solve the environmental issue?</h2>
<p>Following are some of the most common solutions to the environmental issue: Replace disposal items with reusable items. The use of paper should be avoided. Conserve water and electricity. Support environmental friendly practices. Recycle the waste to conserve natural resources.</p>
