<h2 id=why-is-the-sun-bigger-than-all-the-planets>Why is the Sun bigger than all the planets?</h2>
<p>Explanation: Normal stars and planets form by the clumping together of gases, rock, etc under the force of gravity. Beyond a certain mass – say about 12 times the mass of Jupiter and double the size – some fusion reactions will start and the gas giant become a brown dwarf – i.e. a star with low luminosity.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-are-the-planets-compared-to-the-sun>How big are the planets compared to the Sun?</h2>
<p>Outward from the Sun, the planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, followed by the dwarf planet Pluto. Jupiter’s diameter is about 11 times that of the Earth’s and the Sun’s diameter is about 10 times Jupiter’s.</p>
<h2 id=is-sun-the-largest-planet>Is Sun the largest planet?</h2>
<p>The Sun is also to scale with the rest of the planets. By far, Jupiter is the largest planet with Saturn the second largest, but they are certainly no where close to being as big as the Sun, which has a radius of 432,000 miles (695,000 km).</p>
<h2 id=is-the-sun-bigger-than-jupiter>Is the Sun bigger than Jupiter?</h2>
<p>Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, has a diameter of about 87,000 miles. (And even Jupiter is tiny compared to the Sun, which is roughly ten times wider than Jupiter, at about 864,000 miles.)</p>
<h2 id=what-star-is-bigger-than-the-sun>What star is bigger than the Sun?</h2>
<p>The largest known star in the universe is UY Scuti, a hypergiant with a radius around 1,700 times larger than the sun.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-bigger-the-earth-or-the-sun>Which is bigger the earth or the Sun?</h2>
<p>Although the Sun looks small from Earth, it is really much, much bigger than our planet (and any other planet in the solar system).</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-planet-in-our-solar-system>Which is the largest planet in our Solar System?</h2>
<p>The most giant planet in our Solar System, namely Jupiter, has a diameter of around 142.984 km / 88.846 mi at the equator, and a diameter of about 133.708 km / 83.082 mi at the poles. It has a mean radius of 69.911 km / 43.440 mi, and its mass is equivalent to 318 Earth masses.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-smallest-planet-in-our-solar-system>Which is the smallest planet in our Solar System?</h2>
<p>Eris – a dwarf planet. Eris is a dwarf planet in our Solar System. Eris was one of the first three objects classified as a dwarf planet, along with Pluto and Ceres. Eris was first spotted in January 2005.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-kepler-b-compared-to-the-sun>How big is Kepler B compared to the Sun?</h2>
<p>“Our new analysis, which uses stellar sound waves observed in the Kepler data to characterise the star, demonstrated that the star is in fact three times larger than previously thought. This in turn means that the planet is three times larger, revealing that Kepler-1658 b is actually a hot Jupiter,” Chontos said in a statement.</p>
