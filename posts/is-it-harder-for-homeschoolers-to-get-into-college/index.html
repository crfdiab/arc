<h2 id=is-it-harder-for-homeschoolers-to-get-into-college>Is it harder for homeschoolers to get into college?</h2>
<p>Colleges will typically place more weight on your SAT/ACT scores if you are homeschooled. Today, more and more homeschooled students are attending colleges and are just as successful as their traditionally schooled peers.</p>
<h2 id=do-homeschoolers-do-well-in-college>Do homeschoolers do well in college?</h2>
<p>A new study published in The Journal of College Admission suggests that homeschool students enjoy higher ACT scores, grade point averages and graduation rates compared with other college students. Homeschool students earned more college credits (14.7) prior to their freshmen year than other students (6.0).</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-who-are-homeschooled-go-to-college>How many people who are homeschooled go to college?</h2>
<p>2.5 million homeschoolers were at college in spring 2019 According to data provided by Nheri, homeschooled students often do better than their public schooled counterparts while in college. Despite their small number, they have a high graduation rate.</p>
<h2 id=are-homeschooled-students-more-successful>Are homeschooled students more successful?</h2>
<p>The home-educated typically score 15 to 30 percentile points above public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests. 78% of peer-reviewed studies on academic achievement show homeschool students perform statistically significantly better than those in institutional schools (Ray, 2017).</p>
<h2 id=how-do-homeschoolers-get-a-gpa>How do homeschoolers get a GPA?</h2>
<p>Take the sum of the grade points and divide them by the sum of the course credits taken in a given year, and then round to the nearest two (2) decimal places. This is the yearly GPA.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-being-homeschooled>What are the disadvantages of being homeschooled?</h2>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Possibly fewer resources such as technology that may be available in a public school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents must teach a broad range of subjects. Greater freedom and flexibility requires more time and responsibility from the parent.</p>

<h2 id=does-yale-accept-homeschoolers>Does Yale accept homeschoolers?</h2>
<p>Elite-level colleges like Harvard, Yale, MIT, Duke, and Stanford want homeschoolers—and are doing everything they can to actively recruit students who have been homeschooled. They recognize that homeschooled students are often better prepared for college than their non-homeschooled peers.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-is-homeschooling-illegal>What countries is homeschooling illegal?</h2>
<p>There are, conversely, a number of European countries where homeschooling is illegal. The Netherlands, Germany, and Spain number amongst these countries, and Sweden’s regulation of homeschooling is so stringent it is perceived as a de facto ban.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-statistics-on-homeschooling-in-the-united-states>What are the statistics on homeschooling in the United States?</h2>

There were about 1.7% homeschooled US students by 1999 spring, which formed 850,000 students as per the National Centers for Educational Statistics (NCES).</p>
<h2 id=are-there-more-homeschooled-kids-going-to-college>Are there more homeschooled kids going to college?</h2>
<p>A growing number of kids in the U.S. are homeschooled, and many colleges seeking to diversify their student bodies are welcoming them with open arms. While the percentage of homeschooled applicants is still tiny, admissions officers say their applications often stand out.</p>
