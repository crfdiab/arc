<h2 id=who-brought-carp-to-australia>Who brought carp to Australia?</h2>
<p>Others claim the first introduction was to Victoria in the 1870s. The earliest documented report was from David Stead who purchased carp from a “bird and animal dealer “in Sydney and introduced them into Prospect Reservoir in 1907 and 1908. They became known as the “Prospect strain”.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-carp-brought-into-australia>Why was carp brought into Australia?</h2>
<p>Carp have been introduced into Australia both deliberately, in an attempt to imitate the European environment, and accidentally, through the escape of ornamental or aquaculture fish. In the early 1960s a new strain was imported for aquaculture and reared at a fish farm in Boolarra.</p>
<h2 id=is-carp-an-introduced-species-in-australia>Is carp an introduced species in Australia?</h2>
<p>European carp – an invasive species of Australian waterways European carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a pest that adversely affects the health of our rivers and wetlands. It was first introduced to Australian waterways more than 100 years ago and has since established in every state except the Northern Territory.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-carp-bad-in-australia>Why are carp bad in Australia?</h2>
<p>Carp contribute to environmental degradation in the Basin. Reported impacts from carp include reduction in water quality, river bank damage and may contribute to algae blooms. The increased spread of carp and its impact on freshwater habitat has come at the expense of native fish species and aquatic vegetation.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-kill-carp-in-australia>Do you have to kill carp in Australia?</h2>
<p>State Regulations. It’s a popular belief in Australian that you have to kill all the carp you catch. Many people will argue that this is THE LAW although each state has its own separate regulations. It is not mandatory that you kill carp in the Australian Capital Territory or New South Wales.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-carps-bad>Why are carps bad?</h2>
<p>Why are common carp a problem? Carp are notorious for altering natural ecosystems. They uproot and disturb submerged vegetation while searching for insect larvae to eat. Carp reduce water clarity and stir up bottom phosphorus-containing sediments, which contributes to algae blooms.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-carp-so-bad>Why is carp so bad?</h2>
<h2 id=why-are-carp-so-bad>Why are carp so bad?</h2>
<h2 id=should-you-kill-carp-when-you-catch-them>Should you kill carp when you catch them?</h2>
<p>Dont Kill them. some people cut them and use them as bait or eat them, and that’s okay, but unless it’s an asian carp it’s better to leave them alive.</p>
<h2 id=is-carp-a-dirty-fish>Is carp a dirty fish?</h2>
<p>Carp is an oily fish which can have a great effect on its taste but despite rumor, that isn’t where the supposed ‘muddy’ taste comes from. The muddy taste is a direct result of a stress reaction in the fish that can be experienced with many of the more sedate fish species.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-european-carp-introduced-to-australia>Where was the European carp introduced to Australia?</h2>
<p>Three strains of European Carp have been introduced to Australia, an ornamental strain near Sydney (1850-60), a Singaporean strain in the Murrumbidgee (1876), and a hybrid “Boolara” strain in Victoria (1961). The latter two strains have interbred and this species is now a major pest in many inland streams in New South Wales.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-carp-fish-come-from-in-the-world>Where do carp fish come from in the world?</h2>
<p>They are extensively farmed in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, and are a popular angling fish in Europe. However, in North America, Canada and Australia, carp are considered a significant pest.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-carp-come-to-the-murray-darling-river-system>When did carp come to the Murray Darling River system?</h2>
<p>The timing and mode of carp introductions into the Murray-Darling river system is unclear, though there are early records of some carp being translocated from Sydney, and a distinctive orange-coloured ‘Yanco’ strain became established in the Murrumbidgee in the early part of the 20 th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-carp-in-queensland>What do you need to know about carp in Queensland?</h2>
<p>Legal requirements 1 Carp is a restricted noxious fish under the Biosecurity Act 2014. 2 You must not keep, feed, give away, sell, or release carp into the environment without a permit. 3 If you catch these species, you must immediately humanely kill and dispose of them responsibly away from the waterbody.</p>
