<p>How Are Earthquakes Studied? Seismologists study earthquakes by going out and looking at the damage caused by the earthquakes and by using seismographs. A seismograph is an instrument that records the shaking of the earth’s surface caused by seismic waves.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-scientific-study-of-earthquakes-called>What is the scientific study of earthquakes called?</h2>
<p>Seismology is the study of earthquakes and the structure of the earth, by both naturally and artificially generated seismic waves.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-scientist-study-earthquakes>Why do scientist study earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Scientists study earthquakes because they want to know more about their causes and predict where they are likely to happen. They also need to know how the ground moves during earthquakes.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-earthquakes-measured-and-how-are-they-studied>How are earthquakes measured and how are they studied?</h2>
<p>Seismologists study earthquakes by going out and looking at the damage caused by the earthquakes and by using seismographs. A seismographis an instrument that records the shaking of the earth’s surface caused by seismic waves. The term seismometeris also used to refer to the same device, and the two terms are often used interchangably.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-scientists-used-to-study-the-earth>How are Scientists used to study the Earth?</h2>
<p>GPS measures movements of the Earth’s crust with a precision of one millimeter per year. Scientists make use of diverse technologies for studying earthquakes. A seismologist is a person that specializes in geophysics, and who studies earthquakes and the mechanical characteristics of the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-a-scientist-who-studies-earthquakes>What do you call a scientist who studies earthquakes?</h2>
<p>A seismologist is a person that specializes in geophysics, and who studies earthquakes and the mechanical characteristics of the Earth. In addition, seismologists interpret the geological composition and structure of the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-scientists-so-interested-in-earthquake-science>Why are scientists so interested in earthquake science?</h2>
<p>The discovery now gives scientists a better understanding about how most earthquakes generate. Understanding that even moderate quakes probably occur after a series of little ones gives added weight to the idea that earthquake sequences can grow, not unlike the spreading epidemic of a disease.</p>
