<h2 id=how-has-palm-oil-production-affected-indonesia>How has palm oil production affected Indonesia?</h2>
<p>Global warming. The biggest impact of unsustainable palm oil production is the large-scale devastation of tropical forests. Even within Tesso Nilo National Park, established in Sumatra to provide habitat for the endangered Sumatran tiger, 43% of the park has been overrun with illegal palm oil plantings.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-palm-oil-plantations-in-indonesia>What caused palm oil plantations in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>Logging effects and deforestation A major environmental threat is then the destruction of rainforests in Indonesia, which was estimated at 0.84 Mha of primary forest per year from 2000 to 2012. Deforestation is also caused by illegal forest fires to clear land for palm oil plantations.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-palm-oil-plantations-are-there-in-indonesia>How many palm oil plantations are there in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>Size of oil palm plantations Indonesia 2010-2019 In 2019, the total size of oil palm plantations in Indonesia was around 14.6 million hectares.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-environmental-issue-caused-by-palm-oil-plantations>What is the main environmental issue caused by palm oil plantations?</h2>
<p>Palm oil comes from the fruit on tropical oil palm trees. Producing the edible oil wreaks havoc on the environment, leading to deforestation, habitat degradation, and loss of animal habitat.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-negative-effects-of-palm-oil>What are the negative effects of palm oil?</h2>
<p>The production of palm oil can result in land grabs, loss of livelihoods and social conflict, and human rights are often violated on plantations. The resulting conflicts have had a significant impact on the social welfare of many.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-bad-about-palm-oil>What is bad about palm oil?</h2>
<p>Compared to other liquid oils, palm oil is relatively high in saturated fats. Palm oil is about 34% saturated fat, while olive oil is less than half of that. Saturated fats are linked to an increased risk of heart disease and chronic health conditions.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-palm-oil-so-bad>Why is palm oil so bad?</h2>
<p>The main facts about palm oil Here are the main facts why palm oil plantations are harming the environment: They release massive amounts of CO2 in the air as rainforests are cleared. Rainforests’ soils hold about 45% of the world’s terrestrial carbon, cutting them down is like releasing a carbon bomb.</p>
<h2 id=why-palm-oil-should-be-banned>Why palm oil should be banned?</h2>
<p>Environmentalists argue that this farming of oil palm trees is extremely bad for the planet. Palm oil production is said to have been responsible for about 8% of the world’s deforestation between 1990 and 2008. Some also say that eating palm oil is not good for health, as it is high in saturated fat.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-healthier-palm-oil-or-coconut-oil>Which is healthier palm oil or coconut oil?</h2>
<p>Coconut oil is a little higher in calories, while palm oil contains a little more fats. Both completely lack protein and carbohydrates and are low in micronutrients. Research suggests that palm oil is a healthier choice than coconut oil when it comes to cardiovascular health, due to a lower saturated fat content.</p>
<h2 id=does-palm-oil-clog-your-arteries>Does palm oil clog your arteries?</h2>
<p>Dietary saturated fat increases LDL. Palm oil contains saturated fat and has thus been touted to be “bad for the heart”.</p>
<h2 id=why-palm-oil-should-not-be-banned>Why palm oil should not be banned?</h2>
<p>But banning palm oil would mean that the demand for vegetable oil would have to be met through a higher production of other oil crops, such as soybean, sunflower, or rapeseed. Hence, replacing palm oil with other vegetable oils would lead to even higher losses of forest and other natural habitats.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-palm-oil-industry-affecting-the-environment>How is the palm oil industry affecting the environment?</h2>
<p>Palm oil production is land-intensive, and much of Indonesia’s rainforest had been cleared to make way for plantations. The environmental impact of oil palm cultivation has in recent years come under increased scrutiny.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-palm-oil-plantations-in-indonesia>Where are the palm oil plantations in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>Luhut, speaking during a visit to the district of Sorong in West Papua province, said the companies investing in the palm oil industry in Papua were predominantly foreign ones or those controlled by wealthy Indonesian businesses, and that their investments “don’t necessarily benefit local people.”</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-leader-of-the-indonesian-palm-oil-industry>Who is the leader of the Indonesian palm oil industry?</h2>
<p>Luhut has led Indonesia’s diplomatic battle against European Union’s plans to end recognition of palm oil as a biofuel by 2030, even threatening to withdraw Indonesia from the Paris climate agreement in retaliation. He also owns, through his family-run conglomerate, a string of palm oil companies.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-a-ban-on-palm-oil-in-indonesia>Why is there a ban on palm oil in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>In mid-2016 Indonesian President Joko Widodo proposed to issue a five-year moratorium on new palm oil plantation concessions in an attempt to safeguard a healthy and sustainable environment. This was felt necessary after there was fierce international criticism on Indonesia’s weak environmental policies.</p>
