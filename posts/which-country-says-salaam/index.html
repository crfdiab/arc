<h2 id=which-country-says-salaam>Which country says Salaam?</h2>

<h2 id=where-is-salam-used>Where is Salam used?</h2>
<p>Salam (Arabic: سلام‎, salām), sometimes spelled salaam, is an Arabic word that literally means “peace”, but is also used as a general greeting, above all in Arabian countries and by the Muslims and Persian language countries, but also in other countries where Islam is important.</p>
<h2 id=is-salam-a-country>Is Salam a country?</h2>
<p>Dar es Salaam (/ˌdɑːr ɛs səˈlɑːm/; from Arabic: دار السلام‎, romanized: Dār as-Salām, lit. ‘Place of Peace’) is the largest city and business capital of Tanzania….</p>

<p>Meeting and Greeting</p>
<ol>
<li>Westerners may shake hands, however, greeting with ‘namaste’ (na-mas-TAY) (placing both hands together with a slight bow) is appreciated and shows respect for Indian customs.</li>
<li>Men shake hands with men when meeting or leaving. Men do not touch women when meeting or greeting.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=is-it-ok-to-say-salam>Is it OK to say Salam?</h2>
<p>Absolutely fine and you’ll often get a big smile (even from grumpy officials) for making the effort to say it. Asalamu Aleykum is a traditional greeting – meaning merely Peace be upon you, its also used by Jewish people in their dialect and language and some christians too…</p>
<h2 id=is-it-haram-to-say-namaste>Is it haram to say Namaste?</h2>
<p>If a Hindu greets you with “namaste” you can greet him back with “namaste” provided you understand the meaning of the word and it is not contrary to the Islamic beliefs and practices. In other words, if the idea is contrary to tawhid, then we are not allowed to use it.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-haram-to-say-amen>Is it haram to say amen?</h2>
<p>Is it haram to say amen? Amen is a Hebrew word. The Arabic version used by Muslims is Ameen, but it is pretty much the same thing. Amen means please Allah accept the blessed surah which will be recited in Muslim prayer.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-salaam-in-islam>What is the meaning of Salaam in Islam?</h2>
<p>In the Near East, India, etc., a greeting or ceremonial compliment, made by bowing low with the palm of the right hand placed on the forehead. Any obeisance or respectful greeting. To greet with a salaam. To make a salaam. A respectful ceremonial greeting performed mostly in Islamic countries. A low bow as a ceremonial act of deference.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-someone-says-lal-salam>What does it mean when someone says Lal Salam?</h2>
<p>‘Lal’ refers to revolution, and ‘Salam’ means salutations — one who says ‘Lal Salam’ is essentially bowing down in front of revolution. ‘Lal Salam’ signifies solidarity with those who are working on the ground, trying to change an unjust system. It doesn’t mean they are armed Maoist insurgents.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-indians-live-in-dar-es-salaam>How many Indians live in Dar es Salaam?</h2>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets members of Indian community in Dar es Salaam, 10 July 2016 There are currently over 50,000 people of Indian origin in Tanzania. Many of them are traders and they control a sizeable portion of the Tanzanian economy. Indians have a long history in Tanzania starting with the arrival of Gujarati traders.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-give-the-salam-greeting-in-the-quran>When do you give the Salam greeting in the Quran?</h2>
<p>It is also stated that one should give the Salam greeting upon entering a house. This is based upon a verse of the Quran: “But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from God blessed and good” ( An-Nur 24:61). The phrase appears a total of 7 times in the Quran, each time as salamun ʿalaykum (Arabic: سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ ‎).</p>
