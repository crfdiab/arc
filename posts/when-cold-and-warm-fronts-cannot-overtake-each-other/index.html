<h2 id=what-happens-when-cold-and-warm-masses-collide>What happens when cold and warm masses collide?</h2>
<p>When two different air masses come into contact, they don’t mix. They push against each other along a line called a front. When a warm air mass meets a cold air mass, the warm air rises since it is lighter.</p>
<h2 id=what-weather-is-associated-with-warm-fronts>What weather is associated with warm fronts?</h2>
<p>Warm Front Warm fronts often bring stormy weather as the warm air mass at the surface rises above the cool air mass, making clouds and storms. As the front passes over an area, the clouds become lower, and rain is likely. There can be thunderstorms around the warm front if the air is unstable.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-cold-air-meets-warm-air>What happens when cold air meets warm air?</h2>
<p>Full Answer. When a warm and cold air mass meet, the resulting front generally brings precipitation in some form, bad weather for a short period of time, then moves on. Sometimes, however, fronts stall. This is called a stationary front. Stationary fronts occur when neither air mass has the power to overtake the other.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-a-cold-front-overtakes-a-warm-front>What does it mean when a cold front overtakes a warm front?</h2>
<p>Because cold fronts move faster, the cold front is likely to overtake the warm front. This is known as an occluded front. At an occluded front, the cold air mass from the cold front meets the cool air that was ahead of the warm front.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-warm-and-cold-weather>What’s the difference between warm and cold weather?</h2>
<p>Low-pressure systems are synonymous with cold & wet weather, while high-pressure systems are closely related to warm & dry weather. One can argue that their corresponding frontal systems will have the same characteristics. This is not always the case, though.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-object-is-warm-and-cold-at-the-same-time>What kind of object is warm and cold at the same time?</h2>
<p>What if you put your hand in contact with objects that feel cold or warm but are at the same temperature, such as a metal door knob or pot and the carpet or a wool sweater? These objects are all at room temperature but they appear to be different in temperature because they conduct heat differently.</p>
