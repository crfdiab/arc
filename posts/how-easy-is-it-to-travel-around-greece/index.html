<p>Getting Around the Greek Islands Traveling by ferry makes island hopping simple, especially if you’re staying within one archipelago. It is possible, of course, to rent a car in Athens — or on one of the islands — and drive it onto the ferry, essentially turning your island hopping excursion into a seafaring road trip.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-way-to-get-around-in-greece>What is the best way to get around in Greece?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Buses. The intercity bus system in Greece is very efficient and if you do your homework you can travel anywhere in the Greek mainland with the “KTEL” (intercity) green colored buses.</li>
<li>Ferries and Boats.</li>
<li>Airplanes.</li>
<li>Renting a Car in Greece.</li>
<li>Renting a Moped or Four-Wheeler.</li>
<li>Getting Around in Athens.</li>
<li>Taxis in Greece.</li>
<li>Donkeys.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=can-i-travel-freely-in-greece>Can I travel freely in Greece?</h2>
<p>All foreign tourists can now visit Greece without the need for quarantine on arrival, provided they have a negative PCR test within 72 hours before travel or proof they’ve been fully vaccinated. This also applies to visitors from Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-expensive-to-travel-around-greece>Is it expensive to travel around Greece?</h2>
<p>Getting around Greece is generally affordable. You won’t need any money for transport when walking around the city center. When it comes to long-distance travel, from city to city, you can expect a pretty low cost as well.</p>

<p>7 Tips for Exploring Greece on A Budget</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit off-season to save on flights and almost everything else.</li>
<li>Sign up for free walking tours in Athens.</li>
<li>Stay in an Airbnb or couchsurf.</li>
<li>Book overnight ferries in advance.</li>
<li>Venture to off-the-beaten-path islands.</li>
<li>Rent a moped to get around the islands.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-travel-to-greece>What’s the best way to travel to Greece?</h2>
<p>If you have a couple weeks to spare while traveling Greece one of my best Greek travel tips is to hit up a few islands instead of spending all your time on one. Some of the islands are only one hour apart by ferry, while some may take all day. Do your research on sites like Ferry Hopper and see what is best for you.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-from-around-the-world-go-to-greece>Why do people from around the world go to Greece?</h2>
<p>People from around the world travel Greece for its famous islands for the sun and its the cities for the history. I love visiting Greece. It’s warm; cheap; has delicious food; rugged, windswept but relaxing islands; and lively and friendly locals. Visiting Greece is always the highlight of my summer European travels.</p>

<p>These days most people tend to stick to one island per trip (the golden age of Greek island hopping was back in the 70s and 80s). Having said that, there’s no reason you can’t buck the trend and plan a multi-island adventure. While island-hopping can make travelling in Greece more complex, it can be done.</p>
