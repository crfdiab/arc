<h2 id=why-are-cyclones-so-frequent-in-india>Why are cyclones so frequent in India?</h2>
<p>According to Mahesh Palawat, Meteorologist, Skymet Weather, the credit for the cyclogenesis can be given to climate change. Indian seas have been exceptionally warmer than usual this year, making atmospheric and ocean conditions favourable for frequent formation of cyclones and their rapid intensification.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-india-vulnerable-to-cyclones>Why is India vulnerable to cyclones?</h2>
<p>Lack of landmass between the Pacific Ocean and the Bay of Bengal tend cyclonic winds to move into the coastal areas causing heavy rainfall. The absence of air movements from north-western India towards the Bay in the post-monsoon phase is also another reason for the chances of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-cyclone-prone>What is the meaning of cyclone prone?</h2>
<p>A district has been considered as cyclone prone if at least. one cyclone in the past has crossed that district or its neighbouring one on its both sides. during the period 1891–2008.</p>
<h2 id=which-state-in-india-is-more-prone-to-cyclones>Which state in India is more prone to cyclones?</h2>
<p>Although cyclones affect the entire coast of India, the East coast is more prone as compared to the West coast. The most affected states are Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra and Gujarat.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-less-prone-to-cyclones-in-india>Which is less prone to cyclones in India?</h2>
<p>The West Coast of India is less prone to cyclones with one cyclone out of 2 to 4 hits the west coast with majority of them attacking the state of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa and Kerala. With about six percent of the worldwide cyclones, the Indian subcontinent is one of the most affected areas by cyclone in the world.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-vulnerable-country-to-tropical-cyclones>Which is the most vulnerable country to tropical cyclones?</h2>
<p>Cyclone Amphan, the costliest cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean, at peak intensity over the Bay of Bengal. India is a country in the North Indian Ocean that is the most vulnerable to getting hit by tropical cyclones in the basin, from the east or from the west.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-tropical-cyclone-thirteen-hit-in-india>Where did Tropical Cyclone Thirteen hit in India?</h2>
<p>Damages in India were unknown. Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Thirteen was the deadliest tropical cyclone in tropical cyclone history. It made landfall in East Pakistan (now called Bangladesh) but also caused significant effect in West Bengal and heavy rainfall in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-cyclones-originate-in-the-bay-of-bengal>Where do cyclones originate in the Bay of Bengal?</h2>
<p>The typhoons originating in the Pacific ocean also influences the cyclones in Bay of Bengal, whereas that’s not the case with Arabian sea. According to Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), cyclones originating in Arabian Sea are believed to move northwest.</p>
