<p>The Mexican forces were led by General Santa Anna. He led a large force of around 1,800 troops. The Texans were led by the frontiersman James Bowie and Lieutenant Colonel William Travis. There were around 200 Texans defending the Alamo which included the famous folk hero Davy Crockett.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-hero-of-the-battle-of-the-alamo>Who was the hero of the Battle of the Alamo?</h2>
<p>William Barret Travis, Col. Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett and all the other heroes whose deaths have become a national symbol of valor, duty, honor and sacrifice in the name of liberty and principle.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-some-famous-people-who-died-at-the-alamo>Who are some famous people who died at the Alamo?</h2>
<p>David Davy Crockett, James Bowie and William B. Travis are a few of the famous people who died at the Alamo. They perished while defending the Alamo Mission against Mexican troops during the Texas Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-in-charge-of-mexico-during-the-alamo>Who was in charge of Mexico during the Alamo?</h2>
<p>In 1835, colonists from the United States joined with Tejanos (Mexicans born in Texas) in putting up armed resistance to the centralization of the Mexican government. President Antonio López de Santa Anna and the government in Mexico City believed the United States had instigated the insurrection with a goal of annexing Texas.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-battle-of-the-alamo-important>Why was the Battle of the Alamo important?</h2>
<p>The two men thereby ensured the transfer of the institution of slavery from the American South into Mexican Texas. After the first Battle of the Alamo in 1835, in which Anglos and Tejanos defeated Mexican General Martín Perfecto de Cos’s forces inside the Alamo compound, the push for Texas independence was imminent.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-highest-profile-defender-to-fall-at-the-alamo>Who was the highest profile defender to fall at the Alamo?</h2>
<p>Davy Crockett, a famous frontiersman and former US Congressman, was the highest-profile defender to fall at the Alamo. Crockett’s fate is unclear. According to some questionable eyewitness accounts, a handful of prisoners, including Crockett, were taken after the battle and put to death.</p>
