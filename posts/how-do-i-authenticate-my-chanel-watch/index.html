<h2 id=how-do-i-authenticate-my-chanel-watch>How do I authenticate my Chanel watch?</h2>
<p>Look at the watch’s face where the date is displayed. An authentic Chanel watch will display the date number vertically. Some fake Chanels have the date displayed horizontally. Look on Chanel’s website or visit a Chanel store to verify the watch is a design that Chanel actually makes.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-tell-if-my-chanel-j12-watch-is-real>How can I tell if my Chanel J12 watch is real?</h2>
<p>A real Chanel J12 watch comes in a black Chanel case with “C H A N E L” in gold writing across the top. The watch is not in a plastic bag and neither the band nor face of the watch have plastic on them. Fake J12 watches frequently come packaged with plastic around the band.</p>
<h2 id=do-chanel-watches-have-serial-numbers>Do Chanel watches have serial numbers?</h2>
<p>Serial numbers can be tricky as manufactures tend to manipulate them over the years, however on most Chanel J12 models, you should expect to see two English letters, each separated with a period, followed by a series of numbers.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-get-omega-watch-papers>How do I get Omega watch papers?</h2>
<p>To request a certification, please find your nearest participating OMEGA Boutique. Can I have a certification for my own watch ? You can apply for an authenticity expertise by taking your watch to one of our selected OMEGA Boutiques, please find the list here.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-check-my-chanel-serial-number-online>How do I check my Chanel serial number online?</h2>
<p>Can you check a CHANEL serial number online on CHANEL’s website? Unfortunately, CHANEL does not offer a service that allows you to check serial numbers. You cannot check a CHANEL serial number number online on CHANEL’s website. You can’t walk into a CHANEL shop and have the serial number checked there either.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-serial-number-on-a-chanel-watch>Where is the serial number on a Chanel watch?</h2>
<p>Serial number is printed on a white sticker that is covered with transparent tape, with two Chanel logos above the serial number. Sticker has an “X” cut into it to prevent removal without damage. The transparent tape has “CHANEL” printed vertically on the right side and a dark vertical line running down the left side.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-a-chanel-j12-watch-cost>How much does a Chanel J12 watch cost?</h2>
<p>The price for the J12 is $5,700, which is slightly less than a Rolex Submariner (the litmus test of dive watch pricing, in my opinion) which seems about fair when you think about who Chanel is and caters to with the quality of the timepiece. The watch comes in black or white ceramic.</p>
<h2 id=are-chanel-serial-numbers-unique>Are Chanel serial numbers unique?</h2>
<p>The Chanel serial numbers are, unlike Louis Vuitton date codes, unique to a specific item. Meaning two Chanel bags can never have the same serial number.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-service-an-omega-watch>How much does it cost to service an Omega watch?</h2>
<p>According to the Omega website, the service is about $340. However, included with that is a 24 month warranty on all work done, which essentially means you have the watch under warranty for 2 more years as part of the price you pay.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-an-omega-watch-need-servicing>How often does an Omega watch need servicing?</h2>
<p>It is recommended by Omega that their watches receive a maintenance service every 2 years and a complete service every 5 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-find-my-channel-serial-number>How do I find my channel serial number?</h2>
<h2 id=is-there-a-guarantee-on-a-chanel-watch>Is there a guarantee on a Chanel watch?</h2>
<p>Sales guarantee CHANEL watches have passed the most rigorous reliability tests devised by the Swiss watchmaking industry. They are guaranteed against all manufacturing defects for two years from the date of purchase, which is marked by the CHANEL-authorized retailer on the International Guarantee Certificate.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-way-to-authenticate-a-chanel-bag>Is there a way to authenticate a Chanel bag?</h2>
<p>With the increasing quality and attention to detail of the counterfeit, black market handbag industry, authenticating pre-owned Chanel bags has become an art and science. It used to be as simple as asking, “does the bag come with an authenticity card?”</p>
<h2 id=how-to-tell-if-a-chanel-authenticity-card-is-authentic>How to tell if a Chanel authenticity card is authentic?</h2>
<p>In regards to authenticity cards, authentic authenticity cards will have a gold outer line going around the card. This line, if put in a certain light and held a certain way, should be uniform in the gold color… meaning, you will not see a “rainbow” in the gold.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-way-to-check-a-chanel-serial-number>Is there a way to check a Chanel serial number?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, CHANEL does not offer a service that allows you to check serial numbers. You cannot check a CHANEL serial number number online on CHANEL’s website. You can’t walk into a CHANEL shop and have the serial number checked there either. In this post, we provide a beginner’s guide to conducting a CHANEL serial number check.</p>
