<h2 id=what-was-hitlers-weakness>What was Hitler’s weakness?</h2>
<p>No commander works in isolation, no matter how absolute his power might appear. They shared Hitler’s weaknesses as strategists – in fact they were arguably even less talented than he was – and their political attitudes and expansionist ambitions put most of them squarely in the Nazi camp.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-adolf-hitlers-strengths>What were Adolf Hitler’s strengths?</h2>
<p>One strength of Adolf Hitler was his experience of being a soldier in world war one. Hitler believed that with his previous experience, he would be able to plan and view the war from the perspective of the soldier on the ground – which would have aided in his command decisions.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-hitlers-favorite-meal>What was Hitler’s favorite meal?</h2>
<p>Hitler continued to eat a favourite dish, Leberkloesse (liver dumplings).” Today, it is acknowledged by historians that Hitler—at least during the war—followed a vegetarian diet.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-head-of-government-in-germany>Who is the head of government in Germany?</h2>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-people-are-the-german-managers>What kind of people are the German managers?</h2>

<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-germany-from-1871-to-1934>Who was the leader of Germany from 1871 to 1934?</h2>
