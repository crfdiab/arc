<h2 id=what-kind-of-gnats-are-in-georgia>What kind of gnats are in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Gnats in Georgia and Tennessee Gnats and midges are common names for a large number of small, non-biting flies found throughout the United States. These flies typically breed in aquatic environments and can emerge from these sources in high numbers.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-south-georgia-have-gnats>Why does South Georgia have gnats?</h2>
<p>Finding gnats along coastal plain areas (parts of Southeast Georgia used to be covered by the ocean a long time ago) might make sense, some people say they’ve heard that gnats are found in areas where there is sandy soil. A Google search suggests that gnats feed on funguses (fungi) that are found in damp areas.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-get-rid-of-georgia-gnats>How do I get rid of Georgia gnats?</h2>
<p>Repellents: DEET, citronella, vanilla, pine oil, and dryer sheets are commonly used to repel gnats. You can also use fans on your porch to keep the air moving and discourage hovering swarms.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-georgia-gnat-line>What is the Georgia gnat line?</h2>
<p>The Georgia Gnat Line is an unofficial dividing line between where these gnats are more and less numerous. It generally runs from Columbus, to Macon, to Augusta. If you find yourself south of the gnat line, you are in prime gnat territory.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-gnats-so-bad-in-georgia>Why are gnats so bad in Georgia?</h2>
<p>So why are the gnats so bad this year? “The organic matter, everything here in South Georgia, sandy soil. So when the farmers go across and till up the soil it agitates the gnats.</p>
<h2 id=do-georgia-gnats-bite>Do Georgia gnats bite?</h2>
<p>Cover exposed skin. Gnats usually bite around the face, but they can bite any area of exposed skin. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when you’re outside.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-gnats-so-bad-in-south-georgia>Why are gnats so bad in South Georgia?</h2>
<h2 id=what-scents-deter-gnats>What scents deter gnats?</h2>
<p>Repel them with Scent. Try Lighting citronella candles, using lemon or vanilla sprays. While gnats are a fan of sweet-smelling fruit, they can’t seem to stand vanilla, lemon, or even lavender. A little spritz can at least keep them at bay.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-gnats-in-georgia>Why are there so many gnats in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Months of heavy rain have increased water levels in Georgia’s rivers. That means an increase in larvae and more black flies, one of the many insects commonly referred to as a gnat. University of Georgia entomologist Elmer Gray said this year Georgia rivers are seeing high water levels and gnats like that.</p>
<h2 id=what-scent-do-gnats-hate>What scent do gnats hate?</h2>
<h2 id=why-are-gnats-so-bad-now>Why are gnats so bad now?</h2>
<p>Mainly a springtime pest, these little insects emerge as the winter thaws, and they are attracted to moisture. Gnat population could simply be attributed to how moist an environment is. Decaying wood, rotting fruit, over-watered plants and wet potting soil, damp sinks, and drains are all prime gnat spots.</p>
<h2 id=can-gnats-bite-you-in-bed>Can gnats bite you in bed?</h2>
<p>Yes, but only some types of gnats female gnats will bite you. However, it’s not the same kind of bite you would receive from a mosquito or a bed bug. When a gnat bites, it actually slices open the skin with four different cutters.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-gnats-in-south-georgia>Why are there so many gnats in South Georgia?</h2>
<p>GNATS: Gnats, tiny bugs, are the cause of a number of deaths in South Georgia each year. Some of these deaths have been attributed to swallowing a large number of gnats while talking or eating.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-gnat-is-white-with-long-legs>What kind of gnat is white with long legs?</h2>
<p>Fungus Gnats The fungus gnat, also known as the winter gnat, is a tiny fly that feeds on the roots and fungi of plants. Fungus gnats have long legs and long thin wings that have a vein pattern. The fungus gnat eggs are hardly visible and are smooth, shiny white, oval, and semi-transparent.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-gnats-are-in-your-house>What kind of gnats are in Your House?</h2>
<p>They belong to the Mycetophilidae, Anisopodidae, and Sciaridae families and are weak fliers. There are two types of gnats: non-biting and biting, but the ones you find in your house and yard are typically the non-biting type. The most common types of gnats people find in their homes are fungus gnats, fruit flies, or drain flies (phorid flies).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-gnats-live-in-north-texas>What kind of gnats live in North Texas?</h2>
<p>Texas has a species of this insect called the Buffalo Gnat that bites the blood right out of you. Anything with a “buffalo” reference is entirely too big for me. I’m happy to live with Georgia gnats and leave it at that.</p>
