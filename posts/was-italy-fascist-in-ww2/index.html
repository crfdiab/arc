<h2 id=why-was-italy-involved-in-ww2>Why was Italy involved in ww2?</h2>
<p>Italy joined the war as one of the Axis Powers in 1940, as the French Third Republic surrendered, with a plan to concentrate Italian forces on a major offensive against the British Empire in Africa and the Middle East, known as the “parallel war”, while expecting the collapse of British forces in the European theatre.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-fascism-exist>Where did fascism exist?</h2>
<p>The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, democracy, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is placed on the far right within the traditional left–right spectrum.</p>

<h2 id=where-did-the-idea-of-fascism-come-from>Where did the idea of fascism come from?</h2>
<p>The fascist theory of governance is entirely the inverse of the democratic system. Adding to that the nation has more priority than the individuals.

<h2 id=what-kind-of-power-does-a-fascist-have>What kind of power does a fascist have?</h2>
<p>Fascism places absolute power in the state, with the state having priority over individuals, Fascism involves the use of force as a demonstration of strength.
