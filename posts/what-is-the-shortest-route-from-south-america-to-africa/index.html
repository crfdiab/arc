<h2 id=what-is-the-shortest-route-from-south-america-to-africa>What is the shortest route from South America to Africa?</h2>
<p>The shortest distance across the Atlantic Ocean (c. 1,600 mi/2,575 km) is between SW Senegal, W Africa, and NE Brazil, E South America.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-closest-distance-between-south-america-and-africa>What is the closest distance between South America and Africa?</h2>
<p>At a distance of 1,600 mi (2,575 km), Africa and South America are relatively close trans-Atlantic neighbors.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-it-from-south-america-to-africa>How long is it from South America to Africa?</h2>
<p>Africa To South America travel time Africa is located around 7895 KM away from South America so if you travel at the consistent speed of 50 KM per hour you can reach South America in 157.9 hours. Your South America travel time may vary due to your bus speed, train speed or depending upon the vehicle you use.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-would-it-take-to-walk-from-america-to-africa>How long would it take to walk from America to Africa?</h2>
<p>Google Maps estimates it would take 4,492 hours to walk it, which translates into 187 days of non-stop walking. If instead you decided to walk a more sensible 8 hours a day, it would take you 562 days to complete the whole walk.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-closest-point-between-america-and-africa>What is the closest point between America and Africa?</h2>
<p>Quoddy Head State Park<br>
At 7,322 miles, Quoddy Head State Park, Maine is the closest point in the United States to Africa.</p>
<h2 id=is-florida-part-of-africa>Is Florida part of Africa?</h2>
<p>Florida is a long-lost piece of Africa. When North America split apart from Africa around 200 million years ago to form the Atlantic Ocean, a little bit of Africa stuck to North America — the Florida peninsula and an adjacent region of southern Georgia.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-walk-from-africa-to-america>Can you walk from Africa to America?</h2>
<p>National Geographic Explorer Paul Salopek is walking from Africa to the tip of South America. It took ancient humans around 50,000 years to migrate from Africa to South America. Salopek will make the trek much faster. He estimates his journey, which he began in 2013, will take about ten years.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-shortest-distance-between-australia-and-south-america>Which is the shortest distance between Australia and South America?</h2>
<p>In order to get to Australia from South America in the shortest distance, head approximately due south from the southernmost point in Tasmania at the Southeast Cape (43.638 S, 146.826 E) and end up at Isla Waterman, Chile near the southern tip of South America (55.407 S, 70.029 W). It is a distance of 8491 km.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-shortest-link-between-south-america-and-africa>Where is the shortest link between South America and Africa?</h2>
<p>The shortest link from South America to Africa also leaves from Touros, Brazil and ends up near Kabrousse, Senegal (12.349 N, 16.700 W) on the border between Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. The distance is approximately 2839 km. This is another somewhat unintuitive result.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-shortest-transatlantic-flight-in-the-world>Which is the shortest transatlantic flight in the world?</h2>
<p>That might not actually be the shortest transatlantic flight. Cabo Verde Airlines operates a couple of flights that might be contenders as well. They fly once weekly between Sal, Cape Verde, and Recife, Brazil. This flight covers a distance of just under 1,900 miles, and is blocked at four hours. But there’s an even shorter one.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-shortest-distance-between-all-continents>Which is the shortest distance between all continents?</h2>
<p>Total distance: 2779 km. For consistency, I’ve once again ignored the Indonesian archipelago. In this case, the shortest distance is 7353 km from Pengerang, Malaysia (1.367 N, 104.265 E) to Queen Mary Land, Antarctica (64.739 S, 97.119 E).</p>
