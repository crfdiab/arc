<h2 id=who-did-experiment-from-leaning-tower-of-pisa>Who did experiment from Leaning Tower of Pisa?</h2>
<p>scientist Galileo Galilei<br>
Between 1589 and 1592, the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei (then professor of mathematics at the University of Pisa) is said to have dropped two spheres of different masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass, according to a biography by Galileo’s …</p>
<h2 id=how-did-galileo-discover-air-resistance>How did Galileo discover air resistance?</h2>
<p>Galileo found that the heavy ball hit the ground first, but only by a little bit. Except for a small difference caused by air resistance, both balls reached nearly the same speed. And that surprised him. It forced him to abandon Aristotelian ideas about motion.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-responsible-for-the-leaning-tower-of-pisa>Who was responsible for the Leaning Tower of Pisa?</h2>
<p>Mr Galileo was correct in his findings.” The finding mentioned by Commander Scott, namely that objects of different mass fall at the same rate in a vacuum, is associated with a single person (Galileo) and a single place ­ the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The culprit is Vincenzio Viviani, Galileo’s secretary in the final years of his life.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-galileo-find-at-the-leaning-tower>What did Galileo find at the Leaning Tower?</h2>
<p>What is perhaps surprising, however, is that Galileo found that the two balls did not quite fall together. This finding ­ coupled with the fact that Viviani’s biography is the only source to mention that the experiments were done at the Leaning Tower ­ causes most historians of science to doubt Viviani’s version of what Galileo did.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-go-to-leaning-tower-of-pisa>How old do you have to be to go to Leaning Tower of Pisa?</h2>
<p>Children under 8 years cannot visit the tower for safety reasons and children under 18 years must enter with an adult. If you buy your tickets online, you’ll have direct access to the tower avoiding long queues. Online tickets can be purchased from 20 days to 1 day before the date of the visit.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-more-bell-towers-in-pisa>Are there any more bell towers in Pisa?</h2>
<p>Yes, you’ve understood correctly, there are at least two more bell towers featuring a slight, although less visible tilt, due to the sandy and clayish subsoil under all of Pisa. Walk all along Via Santa Maria until the end and you’ll find close to the lungarni the Church of San Nicola.</p>
