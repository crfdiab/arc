<h2 id=is-it-ok-to-not-do-sports-in-high-school>Is it OK to not do sports in high school?</h2>
<p>Not doing a sport in high school isn’t necessarily bad for you. If you’re the type of person to be introverted, or not athletic then sports maybe aren’t the thing for you. There have been studies shown though that a student who is more involved in extra curriculars tends to achieve higher marks.</p>
<h2 id=should-sports-be-mandatory-in-high-school>Should sports be mandatory in high school?</h2>
<p>It should be mandatory to play sports because students will get involved, sports build teamwork skills, and the students will be healthier and more active. Firstly, Students will get involved in the school. This will allow them to make new friends and try out different activities.</p>
<h2 id=are-sports-necessary-in-school>Are sports necessary in school?</h2>
<p>High school sports promote physical health during arguably the most important time of a young person’s life. In addition to physical health, sports participation also promotes mental wellness. The stresses of performing well both academically and socially can be a heavy burden for students.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-hardest-high-school-sports>What are the hardest high school sports?</h2>
<p>The toughest high school sport</p>
<ul>
<li>Football. No fall sport is more physical in every minute of competition than football.</li>
<li>Lacrosse. This sport combines the quickness and agility of basketball, the speed and precision of hockey, and the toughness of football into one heart-pounding game.</li>
<li>Rodeo.</li>
<li>Wrestling.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-fail-pe-in-high-school>What happens if you fail PE in high school?</h2>
<p>There is no excuse for failing PE classes whatsoever. Most schools require at least 1/2 a credit of Physical Education to graduate. If you fail the class, then you will need to retake it or you probably won’t be able to graduate. Honestly, gym is one of the hardest classes to fail.</p>
<h2 id=why-sports-are-bad-for-students>Why sports are bad for students?</h2>
<p>Sports can produce an unhealthy level of stress in a child, particularly a child who is pushed to excel and who feels a failure with every loss. Sports can produce many parents who are negative role models, especially those who overvalue athletic achievement. Sports, even team sports, can promote selfish behavior.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-toughest-sport-for-kids>What is the toughest sport for kids?</h2>

<h2 id=88-bicycling-can-you-get-into-college-without-playing-a-sport>8/8. Bicycling. Can you get into college without playing a sport?</h2>
<p>You do not have to be an athlete to get into college. It may be helpful for students to know that admission committees at highly selective colleges generally don’t value athletic involvement over participation in other extracurricular activities unless an applicant is a recruit.</p>
<h2 id=do-colleges-care-if-you-have-a-job>Do colleges care if you have a job?</h2>
<p>Colleges value work experience because it shows you’ve learned responsibility as well as skills with time management and teamwork. Colleges won’t expect students with significant work obligations to have the same level of extracurricular involvement as students who don’t work.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-mandatory-to-play-sports-in-high-school>Why is it mandatory to play sports in high school?</h2>
<p>In conclusion, Sports should be mandatory in high school because students will get involved, sports build teamwork skills, and the students will be healthier and more active. Most schools in Ontario have sport teams but it should be mandatory for a student to play at least one sport every school year.</p>
