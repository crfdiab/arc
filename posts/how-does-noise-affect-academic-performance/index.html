<p>Noise Can Affect Learning! A handful of research studies confirm that noise has a negative effect on a child’s ability to learn. Children in schools bombarded by frequent aircraft noise don’t learn to read as well as children in quiet schools do, say Cornell University researchers.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-noise-pollution-affect-students>How does noise pollution affect students?</h2>

Noise pollution also affects the teachers. They cannot teach effectively during teaching session because of uncomfortable classroom conditions.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-noise-affect-performance>How does noise affect performance?</h2>
<p>Although people get used to noise and can adapt to high noise environments, noise causes fatigue and decreases the individuals’ working capacity in intellectual as well as physical occupations (16). Various studies have shown the serious effect of noise pollution on the staff’s performance and productivity (17).</p>
<h2 id=why-do-students-make-noise-in-the-classroom>Why do students make noise in the classroom?</h2>
<p>A student might make noise because she finds the work tedious, too easy, or too difficult; because she is uncertain about what to do; because she has difficulty focusing for a long periods, and so on.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effect-of-noise-making>What are the effect of noise making?</h2>
<p>Noise pollution impacts millions of people on a daily basis. The most common health problem it causes is Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Exposure to loud noise can also cause high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep disturbances, and stress. These health problems can affect all age groups, especially children.</p>

<h2 id=does-noise-affect-brain>Does noise affect brain?</h2>
<p>Workers in vital occupational roles require high levels of cognitive skill and they need to maintain effective performance while exposed to higher levels of noise than Threshold Limit Values (TLV). Studies show that noise causes cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in the brain [5].</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-control-noisy-students>How do you control noisy students?</h2>
<p>How to handle noise in the classroom</p>
<ol>
<li>Start as you mean to go on.</li>
<li>Address students individually and not as a group.</li>
<li>Say things once only.</li>
<li>Give noisy students more responsibility.</li>

<li>Listen More.</li>
</ol>

<p>Top 5 Ways to Handle Noise in the Classroom</p>
<ol>
<li>Control Noise From The Get-Go. A lot of times kids enter the classroom already wired from the fun they were having with their friends in between periods or break time.</li>
<li>Signal Your Students to Get Quiet.</li>
<li>Take Away Privileges.</li>
<li>Offer Incentives.</li>
<li>Find the source.</li>

<h2 id=how-does-noise-pollution-affect-the-learning-environment>How does noise pollution affect the learning environment?</h2>
<p>Unwanted background noise in the common learning environments available for students in the Philippines often exceed the maximum level recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) during teaching or studying sessions. These intense background noises are burdensome for students in many schools and homes across the country.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-noise-affect-a-child-at-school>How does noise affect a child at school?</h2>
<p>While at school children are exposed to various types of noise including external, environmental noise and noise generated within the classroom. Previous research has shown that noise has detrimental effects upon children’s performance at school, including reduced memory, motivation, and reading ability.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-school-environment-affect-student-learning>How does the school environment affect student learning?</h2>
<p>At school level, teachers’ attitudes and behavior are important in the use of school space for student learning. Secondly, it assumes that school built environment is strong and consistent in affecting the basic physical variables e.g. temperature, noise, air quality on learning.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-noise-level-in-a-classroom>What’s the average noise level in a classroom?</h2>
<p>The results indicated that the noise levels exceeded the standard TLV >55 dBA as regulated in the Decree of the Minister of Environment No. KEP/48/MENLH/11/1996. According to the data processing, the noise level at school was 70.79 dBA. The classrooms were classified into noisy zones based on the Noise Mapping.</p>
