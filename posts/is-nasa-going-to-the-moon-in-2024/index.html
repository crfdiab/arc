<h2 id=is-nasa-going-to-the-moon-in-2024>Is NASA going to the Moon in 2024?</h2>
<p>The agency’s current target for landing Americans on the moon for the first time in nearly 50 years is late 2024. “It’s a stretch, it’s a challenge, but the schedule is 2024,” Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator, said in late May. In leave-the-Earth-and-go-to-space time, it’s really soon.</p>
<h2 id=will-nasa-go-to-the-moon-again>Will NASA go to the Moon again?</h2>
<p>NASA is getting ready to send astronauts to explore more of the Moon as part of the Artemis program, and the agency has selected SpaceX to continue development of the first commercial human lander that will safely carry the next two American astronauts to the lunar surface.</p>
<h2 id=which-president-ordered-nasa-to-land-on-the-moon-by-the-end-of-2024>Which president ordered NASA to land on the moon by the end of 2024?</h2>
<p>On 26 March 2019, Vice President Mike Pence announced that NASA’s Moon landing goal would be accelerated by four years with a planned landing in 2024 (that is now highly unlikely, NASA says).</p>
<h2 id=are-we-going-to-mars>Are we going to Mars?</h2>
<p>NASA is still aiming for human missions to Mars in the 2030s, though Earth independence could take decades longer. He laid out 2030 as the date of a crewed surface landing on Mars, and noted that planned 2020 Mars rover would support the human mission.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-nasa-going-to-be-back-on-the-moon>When is NASA going to be back on the Moon?</h2>
<p>And NASA will continue that work by moving forward to the Moon with astronauts landing on the lunar South Pole by 2024. NASA is implementing the President’s Space Policy Directive-1 to “lead an innovative and sustainable program of exploration with commercial and international partners to enable human expansion across the solar system.”</p>
<h2 id=when-is-nasa-going-to-send-a-woman-to-the-moon>When is NASA going to send a woman to the Moon?</h2>
<p>NASA wants to send the first woman and the next man to the moon by 2024, through its Artemis lunar exploration program. NASA astronauts prepare for moonwalks underwater. (Photo: Twitter/@NASA) On Thursday, NASA published the outline for its Artemis program, which plans to send the next man and first woman to the lunar surface by the year 2024.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-nasa-sent-a-human-to-the-moon>When was the last time NASA sent a human to the Moon?</h2>
<p>The last time NASA sent humans to the Moon was in 1972, during the Apollo lunar mission. What is the Artemis program? With the Artemis program, NASA wishes to demonstrate new technologies, capabilities and business approaches that will ultimately be needed for the future exploration of Mars.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-that-nasa-never-went-to-the-moon>Is it true that NASA never went to the Moon?</h2>
<p>Unlike all of the other proof over the years about the moon landing hoax, this video will examine how NASA themselves have inadvertently admitted that we never went to the moon nor are we still able to go to this day. Loading…</p>
