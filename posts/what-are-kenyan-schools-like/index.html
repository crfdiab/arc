<h2 id=what-are-kenyan-schools-like>What are Kenyan schools like?</h2>
<p>Primary (basic) education in Kenya is divided up into eight years, or standards, and split into lower primary (standards 1 – 3), middle primary (standards 4 – 5), and upper primary (standards 6 – 8). Before advancing to the next standard, students are expected to pass an end-of-the-year exam at the end of October.</p>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-education-system-does-kenya-have>What kind of education system does Kenya have?</h2>
<p>Kenya’s national education system is structured on an 8-4-4 model with eight years of basic education, four years of secondary education and a four-year undergraduate curriculum. This model replaced the 7-4-2-3 system in 1985.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-are-children-when-they-start-school-in-kenya>How old are children when they start school in Kenya?</h2>
<p>Primary education Primary education in Kenya begins at the age of 5 to 7 after completion of a year of kindergarten commonly known as Nursery School or pre-unit. The first class or year of primary school is known as Standard 1, the final year as Standard 8 and primary school children are known as pupils.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-secondary-schools-not-well-attended-in-kenya>Why are secondary schools not well attended in Kenya?</h2>
<p>Secondary schools are not as well attended as the primary ones, mainly due to both the high cost of tuition and the selective admissions process. After primary school, children take an exam for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education. Only those with high scores may be admitted to government secondary schools.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-good-schools-in-nairobi-kenya>Are there any good schools in Nairobi Kenya?</h2>
<p>There are decent schools in Nairobi offering Kenyan, British, American and French systems of education. Lots of options there – nightclubs, cinema halls, theatre, music events, television and books (few book shops but they are pretty good).</p>
