<h2 id=why-did-the-mexicans-go-west>Why did the Mexicans go West?</h2>
<p>In the nineteenth century, Mexican American, Chinese, and white populations of the United States collided as white people moved farther west in search of land and riches. Neither Chinese immigrants nor Mexican Americans could withstand the assault on their rights by the tide of white settlers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-mexican-repatriation-impact-the-mexican-american-community>How did the Mexican Repatriation impact the Mexican American community?</h2>
<p>(d) Throughout California, massive raids were conducted on Mexican-American communities, resulting in the clandestine removal of thousands of people, many of whom were never able to return to the United States, their country of birth.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-1930s-great-depression-affect-mexican-americans>How did the 1930’s Great Depression affect Mexican Americans?</h2>
<p>The Great Depression of the 1930s hit Mexican immigrants especially hard. Along with the job crisis and food shortages that affected all U.S. workers, Mexicans and Mexican Americans had to face an additional threat: deportation.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-so-many-mexican-immigrants-come-to-the-us>Why do so many Mexican immigrants come to the US?</h2>
<p>In 2015, about 11.6 million immigrants from Mexico resided in the US, accounting for more than 1/4 of all US immigrants, according to American Community Survey (ACS) data. Although attaining the American dream is the reason many come to the United States, it is not the only one.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-mexican-american-war-affect-the-us>How did the Mexican-American War affect the US?</h2>
<p>THE MEXICAN-AMERICAN WAR AND MEXICAN IMMIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES. The Mexican government initially promoted American settlement in parts of the territory now known as Texas in the 1820s to bolster the regional economy.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-so-many-people-move-to-the-west>Why did so many people move to the west?</h2>
<p>Other motives were primarily economic in nature as well. Many Americans moved west to work for the mining companies that formed to exploit the vast mineral resources of the West. Others became loggers, ranchers, or especially railroad workers.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-americans-want-to-settle-in-texas>Why did the Americans want to settle in Texas?</h2>
<p>The Americans came homesteaded and fought the Indians. Mexico required that the Americans obey Mexican laws regarding slavery. The southern settlers now called Texans refused to obey Mexican laws, and declared themselves independent from Mexico.</p>
