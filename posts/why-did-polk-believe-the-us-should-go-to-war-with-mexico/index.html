<h2 id=why-did-polk-believe-the-us-should-go-to-war-with-mexico>Why did Polk believe the US should go to war with Mexico?</h2>
<p>In late April 1846, Mexican troops crossed the Rio Grande and killed eleven U.S. soldiers. In response, Polk requested a declaration of war from Congress, arguing that Mexicans had “shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil.” By May 13, 1846, both nations officially were at war.</p>
<h2 id=did-polk-want-to-go-to-war-with-mexico>Did Polk want to go to war with Mexico?</h2>
<p>On May 13, 1846, the U.S. Congress overwhelmingly votes in favor of President James K. Polk’s request to declare war on Mexico in a dispute over Texas. Under the threat of war, the United States had refrained from annexing Texas after the latter won independence from Mexico in 1836.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-president-polk-willing-to-go-to-war-against-mexico-over-texas-but-not-against-britain-over-oregon>Why was President Polk willing to go to war against Mexico over Texas but not against Britain over Oregon?</h2>
<p>President Polk was willing to go to war against Mexico over Texas, but not against Britain over Oregon because Britain was more powerful (more of a threat) than Mexico, and so a war with Mexico would be less costly than one with Britain. The Mexican War was a “limited” war because it was not a total war.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-things-polk-insisted-that-america-should-do>What are the three things Polk insisted that America should do?</h2>
<p>James Polk as President A workaholic, America’s new chief executive set an ambitious agenda with four major goals: cut tariffs, reestablish an independent U.S. Treasury, secure the Oregon Territory and acquire the territories of California and New Mexico from Mexico. Polk eventually achieved all his goals.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-james-k-polk-lead-the-us-to-war-with-mexico>How did James K Polk lead the US to war with Mexico?</h2>
<p>In this lesson, we will learn how President James Polk led the United States into a war with Mexico that redrew the North American Map in 1848. We will learn how the conflict started and how the outcome of the war affected both countries. Believing God is on your side can give you permission to do anything.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-us-justified-in-going-to-war-with-mexico>Why was the US justified in going to war with Mexico?</h2>
<p>Charles Sumner, a state legislator from Massachusetts, said, “…in seeking extension of slavery, (our own citizens denied) the great truths of American freedom” (Doc D). If Texas is independent, it has the right to own slaves. Also, states in the United States already owned slaves, so the point cannot be argued any further.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-president-of-the-united-states-during-the-mexican-american-war>Who was President of the United States during the Mexican American War?</h2>
<p>In the early to mid-1800s, President James Polk and many citizens of the United States believed their country had the God-given right, also known as manifest destiny, to rule the southwestern territories of North America owned by Mexico since Mexican independence from Spain in 1821.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-us-take-texas-from-mexico>When did the US take Texas from Mexico?</h2>
<p>Eventually, however, Texas was annexed in 1845. The recently elected President Polk demanded Mexico sell its northern territories to the United States. When Mexico refused, Polk planned on manufacturing a war the U.S. was not prepared to fight.</p>
