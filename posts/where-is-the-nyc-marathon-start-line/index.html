<h2 id=do-marathon-runners-listen-to-music>Do marathon runners listen to music?</h2>
<p>Elite runners do not listen to music in races because they need to concentrate on their own bodies and hear their competitors, and some die-hard, old-school runners follow suit. Those runners – who prefer the sound of the crowd or their own breathing over, say, “Fergalicious” – cheered the headphone ban.</p>
