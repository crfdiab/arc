<h2 id=what-was-the-goal-of-the-english-in-new-england>What was the goal of the English in New England?</h2>
<p>Although economic prosperity was still a goal of the New England settlers, their true goal was spiritual. Fed up with the ceremonial Church of England, Pilgrims and Puritans sought to recreate society in the manner they believed God truly intended it to be designed.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-leave-the-new-england-colonies>Why did people leave the New England Colonies?</h2>
<p>Many colonists came to America from England to escape religious persecution during the reign of King James I (r. 1603–1625) and of Charles I (r. The fact that the Puritans had left England to escape religious persecution did not mean that they believed in religious tolerance.</p>
<h2 id=which-person-wanted-to-reform-the-catholic-church-and-was-forced-to-eventually-separate-from-the-church->Which person wanted to reform the Catholic Church and was forced to eventually separate from the church *?</h2>
<p>On October 31, 1517, German scholar Martin Luther is said to have nailed his argument against the Catholic Church’s sale of better treatment after death to a church door in Wittenberg.</p>
<h2 id=did-england-bring-christians-america>Did England bring Christians America?</h2>
<p>Catholicism was introduced to the English colonies with the founding of the Province of Maryland by Jesuits accompanying settlers from England in 1634. Maryland was one of the few regions among the English colonies in North America that was predominantly Catholic.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-english-bring-people-to-the-new-world>How did the English bring people to the New World?</h2>
<p>For the English in the New World there are really three labor options. One is to transport people from England to the New World. Another is to employ or exploit the indigenous labor… And the third is to bring people from Africa.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-englands-goal-scorer-in-euro-2004>Who was England’s goal scorer in Euro 2004?</h2>
<p>England’s goalscorer twice went close to adding to his tally, first lobbing just over Ricardo and then forcing the goalkeeper into a fine save with a snap shot on the edge of the area. Vassell replaced Rooney, but it was not England’s attack that was giving cause for concern it was their defence.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-england-get-a-foothold-in-north-america>How did England get a foothold in North America?</h2>
<p>They had also gotten a foothold in Central America and the southern portions of North America, in Florida and the Southwest. England, with colonizing ambitions of its own, was eager to establish a foothold on the North American coast.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-england-player-to-score-two-goals-in-a-game>Who was the first England player to score two goals in a game?</h2>
<p>In the 1954 World Cup, two goals by Broadis saw him become the first England player to score two goals in a game at the World Cup finals. In the same match, Nat Lofthouse also scored twice in a 4–4 draw against Belgium. England reached the quarter-finals for the first time, but were eliminated 4–2 by Uruguay.</p>
