<p>1971: Apollo 15 astronauts David Scott and James Irwin drive the Lunar Roving Vehicle on the surface of the moon. It’s the first off-planet automobile ride. Forty years after Neil Armstrong made his giant leap for mankind, the Apollo program remains a singular cultural and technological achievement.</p>

During the return trip Worden performed the first spacewalk in deep space. The Apollo 15 mission splashed down safely on August 7 despite the loss of one of its three parachutes….Apollo 15.</p>

<p>1971<br>
The Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) is a battery-powered four-wheeled rover used on the Moon in the last three missions of the American Apollo program (15, 16, and 17) during 1971 and 1972. It is popularly called the Moon buggy, a play on the term dune buggy.</p>
<h2 id=did-astronauts-drive-a-car-on-the-moon>Did astronauts drive a car on the moon?</h2>
<p>Dave Scott was not about to pass by an interesting rock without stopping. It was July 31, 1971, and he and Jim Irwin, his fellow Apollo 15 astronaut, were the first to drive on the moon.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-still-a-rover-on-the-moon>Is there still a rover on the moon?</h2>
<p>Launched on July 26, 1971, Apollo 15 became the first Apollo mission to carry a lunar roving vehicle (LRV) to the lunar surface. When they were done, they parked the “moon buggy” a short distance from the lunar module, where it still sits today—the first of three rovers left on the moon by Apollo missions.</p>
<h2 id=why-dont-we-have-a-rover-on-the-moon>Why don’t we have a rover on the moon?</h2>
<p>The moon doesn’t. This means that the individual grains of moon dust are much sharper and more abrasive. The lack of an atmosphere also makes the day/night temperature swings more extreme. Both of these contribute to wear and failure of rovers.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-first-rover-to-land-on-the-moon>What was the first rover to land on the Moon?</h2>
<p>Created with Sketch. Apollo 15 was the fourth mission to land men on the moon, and it was the first of three missions to use the LRVs. The rover had a mass of about 460 pounds (208 kilograms) and was designed to fold up so it could fit inside a compartment of the Lunar Module.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-seventh-person-to-walk-on-the-moon>Who was the seventh person to walk on the Moon?</h2>
<p>(photo: Nasa) On June 6, 1932, American engineer, test pilot and NASA astronaut was born. Scott became the seventh person to walk on the Moon as commander of the mission, the fourth human lunar landing. Moreover, he was the first to drive a wheeled vehicle on the moon on 31 July 1971.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-steve-irwin-do-after-apollo-15>What did Steve Irwin do after Apollo 15?</h2>
<p>Dodder traveled with Irwin on several expeditions to Mt. Ararat in search of Noah’s Ark. “We ran the Great Wall of China together,” Dodder recalls. Irwin continued to suffer heart problems after he left the space program. On the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 15 mission, he spoke in Aspen, Colorado.</p>
