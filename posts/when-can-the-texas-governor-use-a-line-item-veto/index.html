<h2 id=when-can-the-texas-governor-use-a-line-item-veto>When can the Texas governor use a line-item veto?</h2>
<p>When the governor receives the appropriations bill from the Legislature, he or she has the authority to veto line-items on the budget bill. If the legislature is still in session when that authority is exercised, it may override the governor’s veto(es) by a two-thirds majority vote in each house.</p>
<h2 id=can-the-governor-use-a-line-item-veto>Can the governor use a line-item veto?</h2>
<p>Governors. Forty-four of the fifty U.S. states give their governors some form of line-item veto power; Indiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Vermont are the exceptions. The Mayor of Washington, D.C. also has this power.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-texas-governor-typically-use-the-line-item-veto-quizlet>How does the Texas governor typically use the line-item veto quizlet?</h2>
<p>*Line-Item Veto – Governor also has the line-item veto, which gives the Governor the power to veto individual spending budgetary items… each line-item veto can also be overridden by 2/3rd vote of the Texas House and Senate. This denies the Governor appointment/nomination powers.</p>
<h2 id=how-may-a-governor-veto-line-item-veto-a-bill>How may a governor veto line-item veto a bill?</h2>
<p>Partial veto methods include item (or line item) veto, amendatory veto and reduction veto. If the governor vetoes a bill (or portion thereof), it must be returned to the house of origin for reconsideration. To become law, each chamber must repass the bill (or portion thereof), usually by a supermajority vote.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-votes-are-needed-to-override-a-governors-veto-in-texas>How many votes are needed to override a governor’s veto in Texas?</h2>
<p>Governor’s Action If the governor vetoes the bill and the legislature is still in session, the bill is returned to the house in which it originated with an explanation of the governor’s objections. A two-thirds majority in each house is required to override the veto.</p>
<h2 id=who-can-introduce-a-bill-in-the-texas-senate>Who can introduce a bill in the Texas Senate?</h2>
<p>To introduce a bill, a legislator must file the bill with the chief clerk of the house or the secretary of the senate, as appropriate. Both the house and senate rules permit unrestricted introduction of bills during the first 60 calendar days of a regular session.</p>
<h2 id=why-doesnt-the-president-have-line-item-veto>Why doesn’t the President have line-item veto?</h2>
<p>However, the United States Supreme Court ultimately held that the Line Item Veto Act was unconstitutional because it gave the President the power to rescind a portion of a bill as opposed to an entire bill, as he is authorized to do by article I, section 7 of the Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-line-item-veto>What happened to line item veto?</h2>
<p>United States Intended to control “pork barrel spending”, the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 was held to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1998 ruling in Clinton v. City of New York. Before the ruling, President Clinton applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times.</p>
<h2 id=why-doesnt-the-president-have-line-item-veto-1>Why doesn’t the President have line item veto?</h2>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-veto-power-does-the-governor-of-texas-have>What kind of veto power does the Governor of Texas have?</h2>
<p>The Governor has line-item veto power, enabling the governor to veto individual components (or lines) of a bill. The Governor of Texas’ ine-item veto power applies only to spending measures, only to a bill that “contains several items of appropriation.”</p>
<h2 id=how-many-governors-have-line-item-veto-power>How many governors have line item veto power?</h2>
<p>Governors Edit. Forty-four of the fifty U.S. states give their governors some form of line-item veto power; Indiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Vermont are the exceptions. The Mayor of Washington, D.C. also has this power.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-president-to-veto-a-line-item-bill>Who was the first president to veto a line item Bill?</h2>
<p>Presidents of the United States have repeatedly asked the Congress to give them line-item veto power. According to Louis Fisher in The Politics of Shared Power, Ronald Reagan said to Congress in his 1986 State of the Union address, “Tonight I ask you to give me what forty-three governors have: Give me a line-item veto this year.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-governor-veto-an-appropriations-bill>How does a governor veto an appropriations bill?</h2>
<p>When a bill contains several items of appropriation, the Governor “may object to one or more of such items, and approve the other portion of the bill.” Ibid. Thus, the Governor may line-item veto one or more “items of appropriation” without vetoing the entire appropriations bill.</p>
