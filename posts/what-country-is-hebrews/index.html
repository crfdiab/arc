<h2 id=what-are-the-hebrews-called-today>What are the Hebrews called today?</h2>
<p>Thenceforth these people are referred to as Israelites until their return from the Babylonian Exile in the late 6th century bce, from which time on they became known as Jews.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-hebrews-place-of-origin>What is the Hebrews place of origin?</h2>
<p>The Old Testament account of Hebrew origins begins with Terah of the Chaldean city of Ur (in Mesopotamia) and his three sons: Haran, Nahor, and Abraham. ( Genesis 11:24-32). Haran has a son, Lot, by an unspecified wife. Nahor marries Milkah, who is noted as Haran’s daughter.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-most-hebrews-live-in-the-world>Where do most Hebrews live in the world?</h2>
<p>If you mean the biblical hebrews, the israelites, their continuation of ancestry is probably the jewish people. Most of them live in Jewish communities. Biggest in USA, especially Brooklin. New York. Biggest concentration in their country of Israel. Some genetic tests show there are mutual genes to most jews all around the world.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-speak-hebrew-and-where-is-it-spoken>How many people speak Hebrew, and where is it spoken?</h2>
<p>In Israel, where Hebrew was made the official language in 1922, Hebrew is spoken by pretty much all (roughly) 8.3 million residents. Only half of those who speak it in Israel use it as their first language, but it is widespread throughout the country. Because of various patterns of immigration, the other half speak languages including Yiddish.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-origin-of-the-hebrew-language>Where is the origin of the Hebrew language?</h2>
<p>This language family is the originator of a number of languages spoken throughout North Africa and West Asia. There are a number of Afroasiatic languages still around today; the most spoken is Arabic, and there’s also Hausa, Somali and Amharic. The earliest sample of writing that is considered Hebrew comes from about 3,000 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-standard-form-of-modern-hebrew>Which is the standard form of Modern Hebrew?</h2>
<p>Modern Hebrew, also known as Israeli Hebrew (Hebrew: עברית חדשה ‎, ʿivrít ḥadašá [h], [ivˈʁit χadaˈʃa], lit. “Modern Hebrew” or “New Hebrew”), generally referred to by speakers simply as Hebrew (עברית ‎ Ivrit), is the standard form of the Hebrew language spoken today.</p>
