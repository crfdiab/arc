<p>Russia withdrew from World War I because the Bolsheviks, who had promised the Russian people “peace, land, and bread,” came to power after overthrowing the provisional government. This provisional government, headed by moderates, had seized power from Tsar Nicholas, forcing him to abdicate in March of 1917.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (also known as the Peace of Brest in Russia) was a separate peace treaty signed on March 3, 1918, between the new Bolshevik government of Russia and the Central Powers (German Empire, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire), that ended Russia’s participation in World War I.</p>

<p>Russian soldiers stopped obeying officers’ orders and during the summer of 1917, Russian soldiers deserted in droves. The soldiers returned home to support the October revolution, which took Russia out of the war. The Germans agreed to let the Russians negotiate a peace treaty.</p>

<p>It was not until 1920 that most of the fighting finally ended and Lenin and his followers could focus on turning Russia into a communist state. Two years later, the Communists gave the nation a new name—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), also known as the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>However, the Russians lost at least 250,000 men in 1914 and by the following year, the German army forced a partial retreat. Although the Russian army had a number of successes in 1916, the war created food shortages and a loss of work on the home front, leading to unrest.</p>
