<h2 id=can-an-organism-be-both-a-predator-and-prey>Can an organism be both a predator and prey?</h2>
<p>Keen senses are an important adaptation for many organisms, both predators and prey. A predator is an organism that eats another organism. The prey is the organism which the predator eats. Some examples of predator and prey are lion and zebra, bear and fish, and fox and rabbit.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-predator-and-prey-relate-to-the-food-web>How does predator and prey relate to the food web?</h2>
<p>A predator is an animal that hunts, kills and eats other animals for food. Prey is a term used to describe organisms that predators kill for food. Predator/prey relationships can be illustrated in a diagram called a food chain or food web . Producers make their own food using energy from an abiotic source.</p>
<h2 id=which-consumer-can-be-both-a-predator-and-prey>Which consumer can be both a predator and prey?</h2>
<p>They might be carnivores—meat-eaters—or omnivores. For example, in the Food Chains & Food Webs diagram, two secondary consumers are the mouse and the songbird, who both prey on the grasshopper (a primary consumer.) Predators who then prey on the songbird or the mouse would be called tertiary consumers.</p>
<h2 id=what-will-happen-if-the-predator-is-the-only-organism-living-in-the-ecosystem>What will happen if the predator is the only organism living in the ecosystem?</h2>
<p>The most obvious result of the removal of the top predators in an ecosystem is a population explosion in the prey species. When prey is abundant, predator populations increase because more young are able to survive. More predators kill more prey, which, along with food scarcity, decreases the population.</p>
<h2 id=which-animal-is-both-predator-and-herbivore>Which animal is both predator and herbivore?</h2>
<p>Omnivores can be both scavengers or predators and many eat the eggs of other animals. Examples of omnivores include raccoons, bears and humans.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-a-predator-and-a-prey>What is the relationship between a predator and a prey?</h2>
<p>A predator is an animal that hunts, kills and eats other animals for food. Prey is a term used to describe organisms that predators kill for food. Predator/prey relationships can be illustrated in a diagram called a food chain or food web.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-predators-need-to-be-adapted-to-survive>Why do Predators need to be adapted to survive?</h2>
<p>Predator species need to be adapted for efficient hunting if they are to catch enough food to survive. Prey species must be well adapted to escape predators for their species to continue. If the prey population in an ecosystem grows, predator numbers will respond to the increased food supply by increasing as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-prey-population-is-abundant>What happens when the prey population is abundant?</h2>
<p>Logic and mathematical theory propose that when the prey population is abundant, their predator count will increase, consequently the prey population will decrease, which in turn accounts predator count to decline. The prey population eventually restores, starting a new cycle.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-relationship-between-a-lynx-and-a-predator>What’s the relationship between a lynx and a predator?</h2>
<p>That, plus their predator prey relationship with the lynx, makes for very volatile shifts in population. As these populations continue to reproduce over time, the actions of natural selection can also change the species to make them better predators, or more defensive prey. Either way, this adaptation changes the entire predator prey dynamic.</p>
