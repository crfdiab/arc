<p>#5 – PP (Polypropylene) plastic is tough and lightweight, and has excellent heat-resistance qualities often used as the thin plastic liner in a cereal box. Polypropylene is considered safe for reuse and is recyclable through some curbside recycling programs.</p>

<p>All plastic bottles and containers emptied of food residue and liquids ARE recyclable in your blue cart. Plastic bags can be recycled at your local grocery store but should NOT be placed in your blue cart.</p>

<p>Though Florida did not reach its 2020 goal of a 75% recycling rate, it still recycles above the average state rate. Recycling rates vary even with states with bottle depository systems enacted. In its 2006 report, the Container Recycling Institute pointed to national industry opposition.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-tons-of-plastic-are-recycled-in-florida>How many tons of plastic are recycled in Florida?</h2>
<p>Additionally, the MSW managed in 2016 across the state was a staggering 37,401,392 tons. A collaboration with PPR can help boost Florida’s recycling rates and bring the Sunshine State closer to its goal of 75% by offering easy plastic waste disposal, which for many companies, saves the expense and negative environmental impact of a landfill.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-recycling-rate-in-florida-in-2016>What was the recycling rate in Florida in 2016?</h2>
<p>Florida achieved the interim goals established for 2012 and 2014; however, Florida did not meet the 2016 interim goal of 60% and the recycling rate has continued to decline since that time. Florida’s 2018 recycling rate was 49%, falling short of the 2018 interim recycling goal of 70%.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-recycling-goal-for-the-state-of-florida>What’s the recycling goal for the state of Florida?</h2>
<p>Contact your county recycling coordinators to see how you, your family, your business and your organization can help. This program was developed to encourage the commercial industry, schools, public groups and residents to increase recycling in order to reach Florida’s recycling goal of 75 percent by 2020.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-united-states-rank-in-recycling-of-plastic>Where does the United States rank in recycling of plastic?</h2>
<p>Gaining control of plastic waste is now such a large task that it calls for a comprehensive, global approach, Jambeck says, that involves rethinking plastic chemistry, product design, recycling strategies, and consumer use. The United States ranks behind Europe (30 percent) and China (25 percent) in recycling, the study found.</p>
