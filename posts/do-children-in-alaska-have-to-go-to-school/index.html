<h2 id=do-children-in-alaska-have-to-go-to-school>Do children in Alaska have to go to school?</h2>
<p>Alaska law requires you to attend school from the time you are seven until you are sixteen years old. If you are home-schooled, which means educated in your home by your parent or guardian, you are exempt from this attendance rule. You and your parents are both responsible for making sure that you do attend school.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-go-to-school-in-alaska>Do you have to go to school in Alaska?</h2>
<p>When it comes to independent home-schoolers, Alaska law has little to say. Children don’t have to attend public school if their parent or legal guardian has decided to educate them, according to state law.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-homeschool-in-alaska>Can you homeschool in Alaska?</h2>
<p>Alaska Homeschool Options The law requires that children between the ages of 7 and 16 either attend school or comply with Alaska homeschool requirements. Option 1: Homeschooling under the homeschool statute – As long as you are the parent or legal guardian, you can homeschool your child.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-start-homeschooling-in-alaska>How do I start homeschooling in Alaska?</h2>
<p>Alaska Homeschool Options Option 1: Homeschooling under the homeschool statute – As long as you are the parent or legal guardian, you can homeschool your child. There are no requirements to notify the state, seek approval, file forms, test, or have specific teaching qualifications.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-do-you-get-to-homeschool-in-alaska>How much money do you get to homeschool in Alaska?</h2>
<p>Alaska offers 30 public-homeschool programs for students across the state. These options provide parents with a roughly $2,000 educational allotment for each enrolled child. The money can be used to pay for books, materials, tutors and other educational activities.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-kids-go-to-school-in-alaska>When do kids go to school in Alaska?</h2>
<p>When the weather gets to -50, parents have the choice to send their kids to school or keep them home. They do go outside for recess until -20. Something I thought was interesting about schools and winters in Alaska–if your child is not in class, the office will call the parent to make sure your child is home.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-public-schools-in-alaska-located>Where are the public schools in Alaska located?</h2>
<p>Alaska School Calendar 2021 and 2022 A — L M — Z Dillingham City School District Unalaska City School District Fairbanks North Star Borough School Dist Valdez City Schools Galena City School District Wrangell Public School District Haines Borough School District Yukon Flats School District</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-find-my-school-district-in-alaska>How do I Find my School District in Alaska?</h2>
<p>You can search by typing in your community’s name in the search box on the Alaska Public Schools Database page. The search results will tell you your school district. At that time, go to your school district link, which will give you schools list results of all schools within that district.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-ever-a-snow-day-in-alaska>Is there ever a snow day in Alaska?</h2>
<p>Alaska certainly is an unique place to live. Chiming in from Interior Alaska! If I’m remembering correctly, our local schools haven’t had to use a snow day in more than 3 years. School usually isn’t cancelled or delayed because of snow; usually it is ice that causes school to be cancelled.</p>
