<p>125 types<br>
According to Ian Tokelove of the London Wildlife Trust, there are 125 types of fish in the Tidal Thames (from the estuary mouth to Teddington Lock). Ed Randall of the Thames Angler’s Conservancy names bream, perch, pike, roach, rudd, dace, ruffe, barbel, native and non-native carp, chub and gudgeon among them.</p>
<h2 id=what-species-of-fish-are-in-the-thames>What species of fish are in the Thames?</h2>
<p>Almost 200 commercial fishing boats operate within the Thames estuary, catching sole, cod, bass, ray, sprats, plaice, herring and eels. Some go on sale at Billingsgate Fish Market. New breeds of fish have been introduced into the river in the past 30 years, including chub, roach, bream, perch and gudgeon.</p>
<h2 id=does-river-thames-have-fish>Does River Thames have fish?</h2>
<p>The River Thames is now home to some 120 fish species, including two rarities: the Twaite Shad (a type of migrating Herring) and Sea Lamprey, both of which are spawning in the tidal Thames. In the non-tidal Thames, Roach, Chub, Perch, Pike and Bream can all be found along the whole of the River.</p>

<p>Thames fish There is an incredible 125 species of fish that have been found living in the Thames, and this includes species of conservation and commercial importance. Some of these species you might recognise such as seabass, Dover sole and flounder and others, such as the cucumber smelling smelt, may be less familiar.</p>

<h2 id=are-there-any-seahorses-in-the-river-thames>Are there any seahorses in the River Thames?</h2>
<p>You can look at some of ZSL’s previous recording of seahorses in the Thames, or watch a short ZSL video clip about them. There is an incredible 125 species of fish that have been found living in the Thames, and this includes species of conservation and commercial importance.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-fisheries-officer-for-the-river-thames>Who is the Fisheries Officer for the River Thames?</h2>
<p>Environment Agency River Thames surveys are supported by volunteers from Zoological Society of London (ZSL). The volunteers joined fisheries officers as they carried out the work, which involved netting off small sections of the river and counting the amount of fish in each section. Peter Gray, Environment Agency Fisheries Officer, said:</p>
<h2 id=where-to-find-chub-fish-in-the-river-thame>Where to find chub fish in the River Thame?</h2>
<p>The chub can be found in most stretches of the river. They vary in size from fingerlings up to over 7lbs in weight – but the larger fish are quite difficult to find. They are a good sport fish and will eat most things including worms, maggots, bread and cheese. Their favourite habitat is can vary depending on conditions.</p>
