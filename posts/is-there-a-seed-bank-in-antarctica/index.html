<h2 id=is-there-a-seed-bank-in-antarctica>Is there a seed bank in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Deep inside a mountain on a remote island in the Svalbard archipelago, halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole, lies the Global Seed Vault. It is a long-term seed storage facility, built to stand the test of time — and the challenge of natural or man-made disasters.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-world-largest-seed-bank>Where is the world largest seed bank?</h2>
<p>Svalbard Global Seed Vault<br>
Way up north, in the permafrost, 1300 kilometers beyond the Arctic Circle, is the world’s largest secure seed storage, opened by the Norwegian Government in February 2008.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-us-have-a-seed-vault>Does the US have a seed vault?</h2>
<p>Contact Us The vault consists of three large concrete chambers that collectively have the capacity to hold 3.5 million seed samples. Seed of crops important for food and agriculture will be safely stored for hundreds to thousands of years, protected from global or regional catastrophes.</p>
<h2 id=who-owns-the-seed-vault>Who owns the seed vault?</h2>
<p>the Ministry of Agriculture and Food<br>
What groups are involved in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault? The Seed Vault is owned and administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food on behalf of the Kingdom of Norway and is established as a service to the world community.</p>
<h2 id=does-bill-gates-own-the-seed-vault>Does Bill Gates own the seed vault?</h2>
<p>CGIAR gene banks presently manage 768,576 accessions of farmer’ seeds….One Empire Over Seed: Control Over the World’s Seed Banks.</p>

<h2 id=can-you-visit-the-seed-vault>Can you visit the seed vault?</h2>
<p>The world’s largest secure seed storage can be found in the permafrost close to Longyearbyen. The Global Seed Vault is not open for visitors, but you can join organized trips with guides that will take you close to the entrance.</p>
<h2 id=will-20-year-old-seeds-grow>Will 20 year old seeds grow?</h2>
<p>Do seeds go bad with time, or can you plant them no matter how old they are? The answer is, yes, seeds will eventually go bad and no longer germinate, but it can take quite a long time. There is a good chance that those old seed packets will have a high percentage of seeds that will germinate just fine.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-seed-vault-guarded>Is the seed vault guarded?</h2>
<p>The Svalbard Global Seed Vault provides insurance against both incremental and catastrophic loss of crop diversity held in traditional genebanks around the world. The Seed Vault offers long-term protection for one of the most important natural resources on earth.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-seeds-last-in-a-seed-vault>How long do seeds last in a seed vault?</h2>
<p>Answer: it depends, but generally somewhere between 2-5 years. The two factors that will impact the longevity and viability of your garden seeds include: genetic differences based on seed type (some seeds last longer than others as you can see in the list at the bottom of this article); environmental conditions.</p>
<h2 id=did-bill-gates-buy-seed-banks>Did Bill Gates buy seed banks?</h2>
<p>Bill Gates heavily invested his millions along with the Rockefeller Foundation in the frozen and static Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway. As much as 75% of global crop diversity exists outside the big institutional seed banks, and is held instead by some of the world’s most marginal farmers, most of them women.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-land-did-bill-gates-buy>How much land did Bill Gates buy?</h2>
<p>Bill Gates uses farmland as investment vehicle, owning 269,000 acres of land.</p>
<h2 id=will-7-year-old-seeds-germinate>Will 7 year old seeds germinate?</h2>
<h2 id=where-are-the-seeds-stored-in-the-nordic-gene-bank>Where are the seeds stored in the Nordic Gene Bank?</h2>
<p>Norway and the Crop Trust pay for operational costs. Storing seeds in the vault is free to depositors. In 1984, the Nordic Gene Bank (now NordGen) began storing backup Nordic plant germplasm via frozen seeds in an abandoned coal mine at outside of Longyearbyen.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-seeds-stored-in-permafrost-in-svalbard>Why are seeds stored in permafrost in Svalbard?</h2>
<p>The permafrost surrounding the facility will help maintain the low temperature of the seeds if the electricity supply fails.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-seeds-are-in-the-svalbard-vault>How many seeds are in the Svalbard Vault?</h2>
<p>In total, the vault can handle about 2.5 billion seeds (or about 500 seeds each from about 4.5 million varieties of crops). You can learn more about the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and take a virtual tour of the underground facility by visiting the Crop Trust website.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-seed-vault-at-the-north-pole>Where is the seed vault at the North Pole?</h2>
<p>The vault is secured by four sets of locked doors, according to the Crop Trust. There are also the Svalbard archipelago’s most notorious security guards to consider. Located about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) from the North Pole, the area surrounding the vault is extremely remote, secluded and home to a number of polar bears.</p>
