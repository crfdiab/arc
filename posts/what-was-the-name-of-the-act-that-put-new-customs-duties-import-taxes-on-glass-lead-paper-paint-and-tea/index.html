<p>The Townshend Acts<br>
The Townshend Acts were a series of laws passed by the British government on the American colonies in 1767. They placed new taxes and took away some freedoms from the colonists including the following: New taxes on imports of paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea.</p>
<h2 id=which-act-placed-duties-on-goods-brought-into-colonies>Which act placed duties on goods brought into colonies?</h2>
<p>Sugar Act. Parliament, desiring revenue from its North American colonies, passed the first law specifically aimed at raising colonial money for the Crown. The act increased duties on non-British goods shipped to the colonies.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-new-tax-called-that-was-on-items-imported-to-the-13-colonies>What was the new tax called that was on items imported to the 13 colonies?</h2>
<p>In an effort to raise funds to pay off debts and defend the vast new American territories won from the French in the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), the British government passes the Stamp Act on March 22, 1765.</p>
<h2 id=what-best-describes-the-townshend-act-of-1767>What best describes the Townshend Act of 1767?</h2>
<p>The Townshend Acts were a series of measures, passed by the British Parliament in 1767, that taxed goods imported to the American colonies. But American colonists, who had no representation in Parliament, saw the Acts as an abuse of power.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-indemnity-act-of-1767-exempt-the-colonists-from>What did the Indemnity Act of 1767 exempt the colonists from?</h2>
<p>The Indemnity Act of 1767 exempted tea produced by the British East India Company from taxation when it was imported into Great Britain. When the tea was re-exported to the colonies, however, the colonists had to pay taxes on it because of the Revenue Act.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-colonies-do-after-the-tea-act>What did the colonies do after the Tea Act?</h2>
<p>Colonial resistance intensified until, three years after Parliament passed the Tea Act, the colonies declared their independence as the United States of America. The American Revolution had begun.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-colonists-do-after-the-declaratory-act>What did the colonists do after the Declaratory Act?</h2>
<p>Colonists formed groups called the Sons of Liberty, they used violence to scare the tax collectors after this act was passed.Patrick Henry spoke out against this Act, the colonists asked Britain to repeal the this Act. After it was repealed the Declaratory Act was put in place.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-boycott-of-british-goods-affect-the-colonies>How did the boycott of British goods affect the colonies?</h2>
<p>By the late 1760s, the American boycott of British goods had drastically reduced British trade. Once again, merchants who lost money because of the boycott strongly pressured Parliament to loosen its restrictions on the colonies and break the non-importation movement.</p>
