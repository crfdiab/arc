<h2 id=what-is-the-largest-active-volcano-in-the-united-states>What is the largest active volcano in the United States?</h2>
<p>Yellowstone is one of the largest known volcanoes in the world and the largest volcanic system in North America.</p>
<h2 id=is-yellowstone-pyroclastic>Is Yellowstone pyroclastic?</h2>
<p>The Yellowstone region has produced three exceedingly large volcanic eruptions in the past 2.1 million years. Pyroclastic flows from this eruption left thick volcanic deposits known as the Lava Creek Tuff, which can be seen in the south-facing cliffs east of Madison, where they form the north wall of the caldera.</p>
<h2 id=does-alaska-has-the-highest-number-of-active-volcanoes-for-an-american-state>Does Alaska has the highest number of active volcanoes for an American state?</h2>
<p>1. Alaska. Alaska is home to the largest number of potentially active volcanoes in the U.S., with 141, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory.</p>
<h2 id=is-yellowstone-the-largest-supervolcano>Is Yellowstone the largest supervolcano?</h2>
<p>The largest (super) eruption at Yellowstone (2.1 million years ago) had a volume of 2,450 cubic kilometers. Like many other caldera-forming volcanoes, most of Yellowstone’s many eruptions have been smaller than VEI 8 supereruptions, so it is confusing to categorize Yellowstone as a “supervolcano.”</p>
<h2 id=which-us-volcanoes-pose-a-threat>Which US volcanoes pose a threat?</h2>
<p>The eighteen very highest threat volcanoes are in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington.</p>
<h2 id=which-state-in-the-us-has-at-least-1-volcano>Which state in the US has at least 1 volcano?</h2>
<p>While Hawaii is getting all the attention these days due to lava flows and eruptions from Mount Kilauea, you might be surprised to learn Hawaii is only 1 of 12 U.S. states where active volcanoes exist.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-most-active-volcanoes-in-the-united-states>Where are the most active volcanoes in the United States?</h2>
<p>In fact, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory, Alaska has the largest number of volcanoes in the US that have the potential of becoming active. Fortunately, most of the volcanoes are not located close to populated places so most of these volcanoes pose no real threat to human life.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-active-volcano-in-hawaii>Which is the largest active volcano in Hawaii?</h2>
<p>USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists monitor Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano on Earth. In this 1985 aerial photo, Mauna Loa looms above Kīlauea Volcano’s summit caldera (left center) and nearly obscures Hualālai in the far distance (upper right).</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-dangerous-volcano-in-the-united-states>Which is the most dangerous volcano in the United States?</h2>
<p>Of the nineteen listed volcanoes, the three volcanoes with the highest risk include the aforementioned Lassen Volcanic Center as well as Mount Shasta and the Long Valley Caldera. The CVO further reported that these three blast volcanoes are even more dangerous than Hawaii’s volcanoes, which are not blast volcanoes.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-shield-volcano-in-the-world>Which is the largest shield volcano in the world?</h2>
<p>What type of volcano is Mauna Loa? Mauna Loa is the world’s largest shield volcano, a gently sloping mountain produced from a large number of generally very fluid lava flows. Is Mauna Loa an active volcano? Yes, Mauna Loa is among Earth’s most active volcanoes. It has erupted 33 times since 1843.</p>
