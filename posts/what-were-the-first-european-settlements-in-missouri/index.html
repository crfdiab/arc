<p>Timeline of Missouri History: 1673-1799</p>

<p>European exploration, conquest, and colonization (1673–1803) In May 1673, the French Jesuit priest Jacques Marquette and French trader Louis Jolliet paddled down the Mississippi River in canoes along the area that would later become the state of Missouri.</p>

<p>Genevieve<br>
Genevieve is Missouri’s oldest town. It was founded by French Canadian colonists and settlers from the east in 1735, and was the first organized European settlement west of the Mississippi River.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-settle-in-missouri>Who was the first person to settle in Missouri?</h2>
<p>Saint Genevieve (Sainte-Geneviève with French spelling) was established in 1735 as the first settlement in Missouri. Both were initially settled by the French. New Madrid was founded about 1778 by the Spanish but they welcomed settlers from the United States.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-mormon-church-settle-in-missouri>Where did the Mormon Church settle in Missouri?</h2>
<p>Settlement patterns. In the western part of the state, north and east of the Missouri River, is historic “ Mormon Country .” There, followers of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon church, settled about 1831, first at Independence and subsequently in other areas, until they were driven out by hostile neighbours.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-settlement-in-the-ozarks>Where was the first settlement in the Ozarks?</h2>
<p>Spanish authorities granted Boone 850 acres in the Femme Osage District, now part of St. Charles County, Missouri. Several other Kentucky families came along, and his son Nathan Boone soon followed. Nathan purchased 680 acres of land on the Femme Osage near what is now Defiance, Missouri.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-permanent-settlement-in-arkansas>When was the first permanent settlement in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>The region that became Arkansas was unknown to Europeans until the 1540s. Fifty years after Christopher Columbus landed in the western hemisphere, the European exploration of Arkansas began. The first settlement was not founded for another 140 years, and the first permanent settlement forty years after that.</p>
