<h2 id=how-did-the-round-goby-get-here>How did the round goby get here?</h2>
<p>Where did the round goby come from? The round goby comes from the Black & Caspian Seas in Europe. It was introduced into the U.S. via ballast water into the St. Clair River, near Detroit, MI in 1990.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-round-goby-native-to>Where is round goby native to?</h2>
<p>PATHWAYS/HISTORY: Round gobies are native to the Caspian and Black Sea regions, including their tributaries. They have been introduced to the Great Lakes region of North America, probably in ballast water discharged by transatlantic ships originating from Eastern Europe.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-goby-get-to-ontario>How did goby get to Ontario?</h2>
<p>Round goby was first discovered in 1990 in the St. Clair River near Windsor, Ontario. The fish is believed to travel by the ballast water in ships from the Black and Caspian seas in Europe to the Great Lakes in North America. The round goby has since spread into inland lakes in Ontario, including Lake Simcoe.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-round-goby-bad>Why is the round goby bad?</h2>
<p>Round Gobies are harmful in the Great Lakes and other waterways because of their capability to reproduce quickly. As they can produce offspring six times in just one summer, their populations can increase in a small amount of time.</p>
<h2 id=should-you-kill-goby-fish>Should you kill goby fish?</h2>
<p>Yes you should kill gobies if caught.</p>
<h2 id=are-round-gobies-poisonous>Are round gobies poisonous?</h2>
<p>Researchers believe the round goby is linked to outbreaks of botulism type E in Great Lakes fish and fish- eating birds. The disease is caused by a toxin that may be passed from zebra mussels, to goby, to birds, resulting in large die-offs of fish and birds.</p>
<h2 id=are-gobies-poisonous>Are gobies poisonous?</h2>
<p>Most of the 2000 species of gobies are not poisonous. However, Yongeichthys nebulosus and Amoya caninus have been reported to be poisonous in Japan, Taiwan and mainland China 29,30.</p>
<h2 id=are-gobies-edible>Are gobies edible?</h2>
<p>The more conventional “round goby,” which is found here, is said to be highly edible, canned as a delicacy in Bulgaria and Russia.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-lifespan-of-a-round-goby>What is the lifespan of a round goby?</h2>
<p>about 4 years<br>
Female round gobies mature at 1-2 years with clutch (100-4000 eggs) related to body size. They can spawn every 20 days from April to September and have a maximum lifespan of about 4 years.</p>
<h2 id=can-humans-eat-gobies>Can humans eat gobies?</h2>
<p>To answer your question they are edible. But keep them off your diet if there are other options. Currently, Goby species are primarily identified by their surface patterns; thus, they are easily misidentified as non-toxic and edible mudskippers or other species by individuals without special training.</p>
<h2 id=are-gobies-aggressive>Are gobies aggressive?</h2>
<p>Sleeper Banded Goby (Amblygobius phalaena) It is rarely aggressive towards other fish, however, it is territorial, and will fight with others of the same species unless they are a mated pair.</p>
<h2 id=can-we-eat-round-goby>Can we eat round goby?</h2>
<p>Round goby: Not recommended Round gobies also hail from the Eurasia region. Their diet consists heavily of zebra and quagga mussels, meaning they likely accumulate higher-than-average contaminants, Irons said. For this reason, they should probably be kept off the menu.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-round-goby-fish-come-from>Where did the round goby fish come from?</h2>
<p>Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) The round goby is a small, bottom-dwelling invasive fish. Native to the Black and Caspian seas in eastern Europe, it was first found in North America in 1990 in the St. Clair River north of Windsor, Ontario. Researchers believe the fish was brought to North America in the ballast water of ships from Europe.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-round-goby-in-the-great-lakes>Are there round goby in the Great Lakes?</h2>
<p>In less than a decade the round goby has successfully spread through all five Great Lakes and has begun to invade inland waters. In some areas the fish has reached densities of more than 100 fish per square metre. Round goby prefer waters with rocky and sandy bottoms.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-other-names-for-round-goby>Are there any other names for round goby?</h2>
<p>Synonyms and Other Names: Apollonia melanostoma (Pallas, 1814), Apollonia melanostomus (Pallas, 1814); see Stepien and Tumeo (2006) for name change, and Stepien and Neilson (2013) for clarification on taxonomy and nomenclature.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-have-round-goby-in-ontario>Is it illegal to have round goby in Ontario?</h2>
<p>It is against the law to use round goby as bait or to have a live round goby in your possession. Don’t put any live fish into Ontario lakes, rivers or streams.</p>
