<h2 id=how-does-capitalism-and-communism-meet-the-needs-of-the-people>How does capitalism and communism meet the needs of the people?</h2>
<p>In a capitalistic economy, people compete in a marketplace to secure as much wealth as they can for themselves and therefore increase their standard of living. Communist societies put a higher value on equality and believe that by allocating equally, people will live at a higher standard of living.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-things-distributed-under-communism>How are things distributed under communism?</h2>
<p>Capitalism and private property exist, though to a limited degree. However, in Marx’s fully realized communism, society has no class divisions or government or personal property. The production and distribution of goods is based upon the principle “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.”</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-basic-goal-behind-communism>What is the basic goal behind Communism?</h2>
<p>Communism (from Latin communis, ‘common, universal’) is a philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social …</p>
<h2 id=how-does-socialism-meet-the-needs-of-society>How does socialism meet the needs of society?</h2>
<p>Socialists take into account both individual needs and greater social needs. They allocate resources using central planning, as in a command economy. Examples of greater social needs include transportation, defense, education, health care, and the preservation of natural resources.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-true-about-human-nature-and-communism>Which is true about human nature and communism?</h2>
<p>Human Nature and Communism. Not only is “human nature” not unchangeable, it is also not the default nature of human beings to be greedy and selfish. We can now see that fundamental to human nature, more fundamental than the debaucheries thrown up by capitalism in its imperialist phase, is in fact, the tendency towards communism.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-communism-work-in-the-real-world>How does communism work in the real world?</h2>
<p>1 Phase 1: A revolution must take place in order to overthrow the existing government. 2 Phase 2: A dictator or elite leader (or leaders) must gain absolute control over the proletariat. 3 Phase 3: Achievement of utopia. …</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-never-a-phase-of-communism>Why was there never a phase of communism?</h2>
<p>This phase has never been attained because it requires that all non-communists be destroyed in order for the Communist Party to achieve supreme equality. In a Marxist utopia, everyone would happily share property and wealth, free from the restrictions that class-based systems require.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-people-who-support-communism>What do you call people who support communism?</h2>
<p>Reds: Communist/Bolshevik supporters. Also, “red” is a derogatory term to describe communists. Utopia: A perfect place, in reference to social, moral and political issues. …</p>
