<h2 id=why-are-my-wheels-peeling>Why are my wheels peeling?</h2>
<p>What causes flaking or peeling damage to the finish? It could be the result of a chip caused by a scrape against a curb, underlying deterioration from low-quality materials, or acidic wheel cleaners. Even brake dust itself is corrosive and cause damage to metallic wheels if not cleaned regularly.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-alloy-wheels-to-peel>What causes alloy wheels to peel?</h2>
<p>Peeling can even be caused by the design of a wheel, like sharp edges on spokes that make it difficult for paint and powder coat to adhere properly. Even stones on the road that hit the wheel and take little nicks out of the finish on a wheel will begin the peeling process.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-fix-clear-coat-peeling-on-rims>How do you fix clear coat peeling on rims?</h2>
<p>The clear coat can be repaired in just a few hours to get your wheels looking nice and bright again.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sand the wheels with 600-grit sandpaper.</li>
<li>Wipe the wheels with wax and grease remover and a microfiber towel.</li>
<li>Spray 3 to 4 thin coats of clear coat paint onto the wheel.</li>
</ol>

<p>How to Remove Chrome Plating Off of Alloy Wheels</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the wheel rims from the vehicle by unscrewing the wheel from the wheel base with a tire iron.</li>
<li>Apply a coating of wheel polish all over the wheel rim.</li>
<li>Sand the surface of the entire wheel with medium-grit sandpaper until most of the chrome plating is removed.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-do-i-dechrome-my-wheels>How do I Dechrome my wheels?</h2>
<p>Acid Removal</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill a container large enough to hold the rim with muriatic acid. The acid level should be sufficient to submerge all the chrome on the rim.</li>
<li>Let the rim soak in the acid until it stops bubbling. This should effectively remove the thin chromium layer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-does-alloy-wheel-corrosion-look-like>What does alloy wheel corrosion look like?</h2>
<p>Signs of Alloy Wheel Corrosion Early signs of damage to clear coat often appear around lug holes. Discolored coatings and “bubbling” around the openings are tipoffs. The areas are often weakened when a lug wrench scratches the surface during tire changes or rotations.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-clear-coat-for-wheels>What is the best clear coat for wheels?</h2>
<p>Rust-Oleum® High Performance Wheel Clear Coat is recommended to be applied over Rust-Oleum High Performance Wheel Coatings to provide a high gloss, clear protective finish. Recommended for use on plastic hubcaps and wheels made of aluminum or steel.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-fix-clear-coat-peeling-on-black-rims>How do you fix clear coat peeling on black rims?</h2>
<p>To fix the peeling clear coat, smoothen the rim with 600-grit sandpaper. Sand gently in an x pattern, moving the paper in one direction and across the first one to ensure you don’t make grooves into the wheels. Ensure the sandpaper is wet to prevent making scratches on the wheels using the dust.</p>
<h2 id=will-vinegar-clean-aluminum-wheels>Will vinegar clean aluminum wheels?</h2>
<p>Vinegar. Vinegar is also an all-purpose cleaner for aluminum. Pour vinegar on the aluminum rims, and use a sponge or clean towel in a circular motion to polish or clean the aluminum rim. Repeat as necessary.</p>

<h2 id=what-to-do-about-peeling-chrome-on-wheels>What to do about peeling chrome on Wheels?</h2>

<h2 id=whats-the-advantage-of-a-20-inch-wheel>What’s the advantage of a 20 inch wheel?</h2>

The concept is basic, if you have a vehicle with 18-inch wheels, plus one would be a 19-inch wheel and plus two would be 20 inches. Moving to a 20-inch wheel from 18 inches can provide several advantages. Visual Appeal</p>
