<h2 id=where-is-the-saarc-security-located>Where is the SAARC security located?</h2>
<p>The SAARC Secretariat is based in Kathmandu, Nepal. It coordinates and monitors implementation of activities, prepares for and services meetings, and serves as a channel of communication between the Association and its member States as well as other regional organizations.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-smallest-saarc-country>Which is the smallest Saarc country?</h2>

<p>The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an economic and political organization of eight countries in South Asia. It was established in 1985 when the Heads of State of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka formally adopted the charter.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-saarc-fail>Why did SAARC fail?</h2>
<p>It is true that SAARC has not yet reached the level of other organizations like ASEAN or the European Union in terms of mutual cooperation and regional development. Therefore, the critics hold that SAARC has failed to achieve desired progress due to an environment of disputes and mistrust.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-logo-of-saarc-mean>What does the logo of SAARC mean?</h2>
<p>SAARC means South Asian Association for Regional Co-Operation. The SAARC logo shows two hands joining together. There are seven doves in between the two hands. The two hands symbolize friendship and goodwill. Seven doves represent the seven member nations seeking peace.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-saarc-secretariat-located-in-nepal>Where is the SAARC Secretariat located in Nepal?</h2>
<p>The programs and annual budget of Regional Centres and Specialized Bodies as well as programs/Calendar of Activities of the SAARC Secretariat for 2018 were approved during the Session. Nepal hosts SAARC Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS Centre (STAC) in Thimi, Bhaktapur.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-member-states-of-the-saarc>Who are the member states of the SAARC?</h2>
<p>SAARC consists of eight South Asian states: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and India.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-saarc-framework-agreement-signed-in-kathmandu>When was SAARC Framework Agreement signed in Kathmandu?</h2>
<p>Signing of SAARC Framework Agreement for Energy Cooperation (Electricity) was an important achievement of the Summit. Nepal had also successfully organized the 3 rd and 11 th Summits in Kathmandu in 1987 and 2002 respectively.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-india-want-to-get-out-of-saarc>Why does India want to get out of SAARC?</h2>
<p>Rather than deal with Pakistan, India seems to be abandoning SAARC in favor of BIMSTEC. India recently hosted a meeting of security chiefs from the seven member states of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).</p>
