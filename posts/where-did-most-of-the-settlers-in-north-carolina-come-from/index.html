<h2 id=where-did-most-of-the-settlers-in-north-carolina-come-from>Where did most of the settlers in North Carolina come from?</h2>
<p>Scots-Irish immigrants begin coming to North Carolina in large numbers, settling mainly in the Piedmont. Most are second-generation colonists moving south down the Great Wagon Road from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, but a few come directly from Northern Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=where-were-the-first-settlers-in-carolina-from>Where were the first settlers in Carolina from?</h2>
<p>The Carolinas The first permanent English settlement was established in 1653 when emigrants from the Virginia Colony, New England, and Bermuda settled on the shores of Albemarle Sound in the northeastern corner of present-day North Carolina.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-settlers-of-north-carolina-come-from>Where did the first settlers of North Carolina come from?</h2>
<p>In the 1650s, the first permanent English settlers in North Carolina actually came from the southern part of the Virginia Colony and settled in the Albemarle area in the northern part of present-day North Carolina.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-slaves-come-from-in-north-carolina>Where did slaves come from in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>There were more slaves in both Virginia and South Carolina in 1860. The Appalachian mountain counties had a lower percentage of slaves. The number of slaves in the western North Carolina counties (Davidson, Washington, Tennessee, Sullivan) that became part of Tennessee in 1796 had relatively few slaves.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-scottish-settlers-settle-in-the-united-states>Where did the Scottish settlers settle in the United States?</h2>
<p>Scottish Settlers. Pennsylvania was the most popular destination, but Scotch-Irish immigrants also settled in South Carolina, New Jersey, and Maryland. The Scotch-Irish, or Ulster Scots, were descendants of the Lowland Scots, whom James I of England had settled in Ulster, the northern and most isolated and conservative part of Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-north-carolina-in-1765>What was the population of North Carolina in 1765?</h2>
<p>The colony grew rapidly from a population of 100,000 in 1752 to 200,000 in 1765. By 1760, enslaved Africans constituted one-quarter of the population and were concentrated along the coast. In the late eighteenth century, the tide of immigration to North Carolina from Virginia and Pennsylvania began to swell.</p>
