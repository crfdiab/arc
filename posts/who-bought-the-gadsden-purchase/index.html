<p>James Gadsden<br>
The Gadsden Purchase is a roughly 30,000 square-mile region of present-day southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico that was acquired by the United States in a treaty signed by American ambassador to Mexico James Gadsden on December 30, 1853.</p>

<p>1848<br>
Area Mexico ceded to the United States in 1848, minus Texan claims. The Mexican Cession consisted of present-day U.S. states of California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona, the western half of New Mexico, the western quarter of Colorado, and the southwest corner of Wyoming.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-united-states-acquire-from-mexico>What did the United States acquire from Mexico?</h2>
<p>Americans were not satisfied with an isolated California discontinuous from the rest of the United States. As part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States also acquired all the Mexican territory between California and Texas. This included occupied regions such as New Mexico and Arizona.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-territory-of-mexico-before-independence>What was the territory of Mexico before independence?</h2>
<p>Some of the borders of states in the north, and in northeast Texas, before independence and the Mexican Cession The Republic of Baja California and Republic of Sonora – proclaimed by the American William Walker in 1854, were never more than a declaration and are not shown on maps.</p>

Known as the Mexican Cession, the area included more than 500,000 square miles and all or parts of modern-day California, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-us-border-with-mexico-during-the-mexican-war>What was the US border with Mexico during the Mexican War?</h2>
