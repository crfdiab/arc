<h2 id=what-is-the-religion-of-siddhartha>What is the religion of Siddhartha?</h2>
<p>Buddhism is a faith that was founded by Siddhartha Gautama (“the Buddha”) more than 2,500 years ago in India. With about 470 million followers, scholars consider Buddhism one of the major world religions.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-siddhartha-create-a-new-religion>How did Siddhartha create a new religion?</h2>
<p>Buddhism began in India when Siddhartha Gautama became enlightened under the Tree of Wisdom, the Bo Tree. From then on, he was referred to as the Buddha, meaning enlightened one. He began teaching what he had learned and attracted many followers.</p>
<h2 id=which-religion-did-buddhism-develop>Which religion did Buddhism develop?</h2>
<p>Buddhism arose in the eastern part of Ancient India, in and around the ancient Kingdom of Magadha (now in Bihar, India), and is based on the teachings of Siddhārtha Gautama. The religion evolved as it spread from the northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent through Central, East, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religion-when-buddha-was-born>What was the religion when Buddha was born?</h2>
<p>Buddha was born around 560 B.C. as a Hindu prince named Siddhartha Gautama, in northern India. From his childhood Gautama was very compassionate. Wise men prophesied that Gautama would be hurt by seeing human suffering; consequently, he would renounce the world and become a great religious leader.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-siddhartha-willing-to-break-with-religion>Why was Siddhartha willing to break with religion?</h2>
<p>Although Siddhartha is willing to break with religion itself and to abandon all his training, Govinda is willing to seek truth only as long as it appears within the narrow confines of Hinduism or Buddhism and is transmitted by a respected teacher.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-siddhartha-begin-to-look-for-enlightenment>How did Siddhartha begin to look for enlightenment?</h2>
<p>Siddhartha begins looking for enlightenment initially by looking for external guidance from organized religion in the form of Brahmins, Samanas, and Buddhists.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-siddhartha-gautama-become-known-as-the-buddha>How did Siddhartha Gautama become known as the Buddha?</h2>
<p>Siddhartha Gautama, who later became known as “The Buddha,” lived during the 5th century B.C. Gautama was born into a wealthy family as a prince in present-day Nepal. Although he had an easy life, Gautama was moved by suffering in the world. He decided to give up his lavish lifestyle and endure poverty.</p>
