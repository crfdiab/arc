<h2 id=how-many-acres-of-crops-were-harvested-in-the-plains-states-in-1879-in-1899-in-1929->How many acres of crops were harvested in the Plains States in 1879 in 1899 in 1929 *?</h2>
<p>In 1879 12 million acres of crops are harvested in Great Plains; in 1899, 54 million; in 1919, 88 million; in 1929, 103 million.</p>
<h2 id=could-a-child-born-in-a-soddy-in-the-1880s-have-been-a-farmer-during-the-dust-bowl-years-quizlet>Could a child born in a Soddy in the 1880s have been a farmer during the Dust Bowl years quizlet?</h2>
<p>Could a child born in a soddy in the 1880s have been a farmer during the Dust Bowl years? Explain your thinking. Yes. A child born in 1880 would have only been in his or her fifties during the Dust Bowl years.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-era-known-as-the-dirty-thirties>What was the era known as the Dirty Thirties?</h2>
<p>The Dust Bowl, also known as “the Dirty Thirties,” started in 1930 and lasted for about a decade, but its long-term economic impacts on the region lingered much longer. Massive dust storms began in 1931. A series of drought years followed, further exacerbating the environmental disaster.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-soil-was-lost-in-the-dust-bowl>How much soil was lost in the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>➢ More than 850 million tons of topsoil had blown off the southern plains in 1935, nearly 8 tons of dirt for every resident of the United States. In the Dust Bowl, farmers lost 480 tons per acre.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-mini-q>What is a mini Q?</h2>
<p>Mini-Qs are Short Students usually work with 4-6 documents. This provides practice reading and interpreting without overwhelming students.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-dust-bowl-packet>What caused the Dust Bowl packet?</h2>
<p>What circumstances conspired to cause the Dust Bowl? Economic depression coupled with extended drought, unusually high temperatures, poor agricultural practices and the resulting wind erosion all contributed to making the Dust Bowl. The seeds of the Dust Bowl may have been sowed during the early 1920s.</p>
<h2 id=what-according-to-this-report-were-three-causes-of-the-dust-bowl>What according to this report were three causes of the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<h2 id=what-caused-dirty-thirties>What caused Dirty Thirties?</h2>
<p>The Dust Bowl of the 1930s sometimes referred to as the “Dirty Thirties”, lasted about a decade. It was caused by severe drought and decades of extensive farming without crop rotation. The main area of impact was on the southern plains, though northern areas were also affected, but not nearly with as much devastation.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-causes-of-the-dust-bowl>What are the 3 causes of the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<h2 id=what-was-the-production-of-cotton-in-1909>What was the production of cotton in 1909?</h2>
<p>Cotton went from 0.33 bales per acre 1909 to 1.06 bales per acre in 1964. Sorghum production went from 10.8 bushels per acre in 1909 to 52.7 bushels per acre in 1969. Sometimes, farmers immigrating from one part of the country to another – or one part of the world to another – will introduce new crops to a region.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-number-of-acres-planted-in-corn-in-1909>What was the number of acres planted in corn in 1909?</h2>
<p>Going back to 1899, there has been a steady decline in the number of acres planted in corn, from around 95 million acres in 1909 to 52.5 million acres in 1969. But the total corn grown shot up from 2.6 billion bushels to over 4.4 billion bushels.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-crops-were-grown-in-the-northern-plains>What kind of crops were grown in the northern plains?</h2>
<p>In the northern plains and parts of Minnesota, quick growing varieties of spring wheat was planted in the spring and harvested in the fall. Wheat was grown primarily for human consumption in the form of flour. Across the country, the development of hybrids, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation and new machines has changed cropping patterns today.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-yield-of-wheat-in-1969>What was the yield of wheat in 1969?</h2>
<p>That push came to fruition in the 60s when production topped one billion bushels for the first time in the U.S. in 1969. There were similar increases in yield for most major crops – Wheat yields went from 12.5 bushels per acre in 1899 to 29.3 in 1969. Hay harvested went from 1.28 tons per acre in 1899 to 2.1 tons in 1969.</p>
