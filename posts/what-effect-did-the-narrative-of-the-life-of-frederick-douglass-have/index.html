<h2 id=what-effect-did-the-narrative-of-the-life-of-frederick-douglass-have>What effect did the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass have?</h2>
<p>His newfound liberty on the platform eventually led him to start a black newspaper against the advice of his “fellow” abolitionists. The publication of Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass opened several doors, not only for Douglass’s ambitious work, but also for the anti-slavery movement of that time.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-significance-of-frederick-douglasss-autobiography>What was the significance of Frederick Douglass’s autobiography?</h2>
<p>The first autobiography, The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave, Written by Himself, catapulted him to fame and invigorated the abolitionist movement. Of Douglass’s many speeches, “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?” was perhaps one of the most well-known.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-lincolns-impact-on-douglass>What was Lincoln’s impact on Douglass?</h2>
<p>By 1860, Douglass was well known for his efforts to end slavery and his skill at public speaking. During the Civil War, Douglass was a consultant to President Abraham Lincoln and helped convince him that slaves should serve in the Union forces and that the abolition of slavery should be a goal of the war.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-introduction-of-sugar-change-the-world>How did the introduction of sugar change the world?</h2>
<p>It was the introduction of sugar slavery in the New World that changed everything. “The true Age of Sugar had begun — and it was doing more to reshape the world than any ruler, empire or war had ever done,” Marc Aronson and Marina Budhos write in their 2010 book, “Sugar Changed the World.”</p>
<h2 id=what-was-slavery-like-on-the-sugar-plantations>What was slavery like on the sugar plantations?</h2>
<p>The number of enslaved labor crews doubled on sugar plantations. And in every sugar parish, black people outnumbered whites. These were some of the most skilled laborers, doing some of the most dangerous agricultural and industrial work in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-sugar-come-from-in-the-united-states>Where did sugar come from in the United States?</h2>
<p>By the 1720s, one of every two ships in the city’s port was either arriving from or heading to the Caribbean, importing sugar and enslaved people and exporting flour, meat and shipbuilding supplies.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-sugar-become-the-white-gold-that-fueled-slavery>How did sugar become the white gold that fueled slavery?</h2>
<p>How sugar became the “white gold” that fueled slavery — and an industry that continues to exploit black lives to this day. The 1619 Project examines the legacy of slavery in America. Read all the stories. The sugar that saturates the American diet has a barbaric history as the ‘white gold’ that fueled slavery.</p>
