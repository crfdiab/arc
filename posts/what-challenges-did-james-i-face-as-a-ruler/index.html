<h2 id=what-challenges-did-james-i-face-as-a-ruler>What challenges did James I face as a ruler?</h2>
<p>James’s ensuing reign was a controversial one, in part because of many political decisions that Parliament and the public found vexing: he spent lavishly, summoned Parliament only once between 1612 and 1622, levied an unpopular tax on imports and exports without Parliament’s consent, and tried to forge an alliance with …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-james-1-afraid-of>What was James 1 afraid of?</h2>
<p>King James was widely considered paranoid (can you tell from the witch thing?). Throughout his whole reign, he was terrified that he would be assassinated. In 1605, James uncovered an assassination attempt against him: the Gunpowder Plot.</p>
<h2 id=what-religious-issues-did-james-face>What religious issues did James face?</h2>

<h2 id=why-did-guy-fawkes-want-to-kill-king-james>Why did Guy Fawkes want to kill King James?</h2>
<p>King james was Protestant and of course, did not like Catholics nor, did they like him. They expected him to be more tolerant of them but instead he asked them all to leave England. That caused the Gunpowder Plot inwhich Guy Fawkes and many other Catholics attempted to kill King James, his wife, his son, and the House of Parliament.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-king-james-do-for-a-living>What did King James do for a living?</h2>
<p>James’s firm belief in the divine right of kings, and constant need for money, also brought him into conflict repeatedly with parliament. Abroad, James attempted to encourage European peace. In 1604, he ended the long-running war with Spain and tried to arrange a marriage between his son and the Spanish Infanta.</p>
