<h2 id=when-did-charles-i-start-having-problems-with-parliament>When did Charles I start having problems with parliament?</h2>
<p>Conflict with Parliament. In March 1625, Charles I became king and married Henrietta Maria soon afterward. When his first Parliament met in June, trouble immediately arose because of the general distrust of Buckingham, who had retained his ascendancy over the new king.</p>
<h2 id=did-charles-11-dissolve-parliament>Did Charles 11 dissolve parliament?</h2>
<p>Charles II dissolved Parliament itself on 24 January 1679 after conflict occurred following his dealings with France and his efforts to become an absolute ruler. It was also a period of anti-Catholic sentiment and witch-hunts. He ruled without parliament until his death in 1685.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-charles-1-and-parliament-fall-out>Why did Charles 1 and Parliament fall out?</h2>
<p>Charles dissolved parliament three times between 1625 and 1629. Unrest in Scotland – because Charles attempted to force a new prayer book on the country – put an end to his personal rule. He was forced to call parliament to obtain funds to fight the Scots.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-king-charles-i-get-rid-of-parliament>How did King Charles I get rid of Parliament?</h2>
<p>Charles used a private ‘Court of the Star Chamber’ to try and punish his opponents. When Parliament complained in 1629, he dismissed them. Until 1640, Charles ruled without a Parliament, a period known as the ‘Eleven Years Tyranny’.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-charles-i-and-the-parliament>What was the relationship between Charles I and the Parliament?</h2>
<p>The Relationship of Charles I and the Parliament in 1629 In 1629 Charles I dismissed Parliament and forbade people to speak of calling another, this was the start of Personal Rule. In the body of this essay the events and disputes that led to this situation will be explored fully.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-charles-i-do-to-the-house-of-commons>What did Charles I do to the House of Commons?</h2>
<p>From the beginning of his reign, Charles I demonstrated a distrust of the House of Commons. Parliament was critical of his government, condemning his policies of arbitrary taxation and imprisonment. On several occasions, Charles I dissolved Parliament without its consent.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-king-charles-i-adjourn-parliament-in-1629>Why did King Charles I adjourn parliament in 1629?</h2>
<p>The king ordered the adjournment of Parliament on March 2, 1629, but before that the speaker was held down in his chair and three resolutions were passed condemning the king’s conduct. Charles realized that such behaviour was revolutionary.</p>
