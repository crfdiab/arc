<h2 id=what-is-the-location-of-venus-in-the-solar-system>What is the location of Venus in the solar system?</h2>
<p>Venus, second planet from the Sun and sixth in the solar system in size and mass. No planet approaches closer to Earth than Venus; at its nearest it is the closest large body to Earth other than the Moon.</p>
<h2 id=what-planet-is-located-between-venus-and-mars>What planet is located between Venus and Mars?</h2>
<p>Earth<br>
The planet located between Venus and Mars is Earth.</p>
<h2 id=between-which-of-the-two-planets-earth-is-located>Between which of the two planets Earth is located?</h2>
<p>The earth is situated between the planets Venus and Mars.</p>
<h2 id=which-two-planets-are-closest-together>Which two planets are closest together?</h2>
<p>To find the average distance between Earth & Mars and Earth & Venus, subtract the smaller radius from the bigger one for each pair. The smaller distance gives us the closest planet. That’s Venus!</p>
<h2 id=what-are-jovian-planets>What are Jovian planets?</h2>
<p>Also called “giant planets,” the Jovian planets occupy orbits in the outer solar system at distances ranging from 5 (Jupiter) to 30 (Neptune) times the Earth’s distance from the Sun. Saturn and Jupiter each have more than 60 moons, Uranus has more than 20, and Neptune has more than 10.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-two-planets-touched>What would happen if two planets touched?</h2>
<p>At the point where they touch, you’re weightless, because the gravitational pull of the two planets apply to you in equal measures. So yes, you could move from one to another. That’s more or less theoretically impossible. If they were not rotating about a common centre of gravity, they would instantly merge.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-planet-venus-the-same-size-as-the-earth>Is the planet Venus the same size as the Earth?</h2>
<p>Venus is almost the same size as the Earth. This is one reason why Venus is sometimes thought of as Earth’s “twin”.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-second-closest-planet-to-the-sun>Which is the second closest planet to the Sun?</h2>
<p>Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet. This means that we think it was created in a similar way to our planet Earth. Venera 7, the first space probe to land on Venus, was put out of action by the hostile conditions on Venus after only 23 minutes. Almost all of the surface features on Venus are named after women.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-volcanoes-on-the-surface-of-venus>Are there any volcanoes on the surface of Venus?</h2>
<p>Venus also has volcanoes like those on Earth. Parts of the surface of Venus look something like continents. The largest of these areas is called Ishtar Terra. Deep basins like those under the Earth’s oceans have also been discovered. On Venus, though, they have no water.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-planet-venus-get-its-name>How did the planet Venus get its name?</h2>
<p>If you were on Venus, it would pull you down almost as strongly as Earth. Who is it named after? Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love. Sometimes it can be seen shining brightly just before dawn or just after sunset. Some peoples, like the Aztecs and the Greeks, gave Venus two names â€“ one for the morning and one for the evening.</p>
