<h2 id=where-does-light-independent-take-place>Where does light independent take place?</h2>
<p>chloroplast<br>
The light independent process (also called dark reactions or the Calvin-Benson cycle) takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast. Carbon dioxide is modified by series of chemical reactions to form carbohydrates. The energy for these reactions comes from ATP and NADPH generated during the light dependent process.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-the-light-independent-reactions-take-place-within-the-chloroplast>Where do the light-independent reactions take place within the chloroplast?</h2>
<p>Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts, the light-dependent reactions are located on the innermost membrane of chloroplasts called thylakoid membrane and light-independent reactions occur in the cytoplasm of the chloroplasts called stroma [17].</p>
<h2 id=do-light-dependent-and-light-independent-occur-at-the-same-time>Do light dependent and light independent occur at the same time?</h2>
<p>In fact, the light independent reactions occur at the same time as the light dependent reactions, because they are driven by the ATP made by the light-dependent reactions. Both systems shut down in the dark. The light-independent reactions can last a little longer if there is ATP remaining in the chloroplast.</p>
<h2 id=what-part-of-the-light-dependent-reactions-will-be-used-in-the-light-independent-reactions>What part of the light-dependent reactions will be used in the light-independent reactions?</h2>
<p>In the light-independent reactions or Calvin cycle, the energized electrons from the light-dependent reactions provide the energy to form carbohydrates from carbon dioxide molecules. The light-independent reactions are sometimes called the Calvin cycle because of the cyclical nature of the process.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-light-dependent-and-light-independent-reaction>What is the difference between light-dependent and light independent reaction?</h2>
<p>In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-end-product-of-light-independent-reaction>What is the end product of light independent reaction?</h2>
<p>There are two end products of the light reaction of photosynthesis, ATP and NADPH. These molecules are produced during the cyclic and the non-cyclic photophosphorylation reactions. These are the products which are used in the dark reactions.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-another-name-for-the-light-independent-reaction>What is another name for the light independent reaction?</h2>
<p>the Calvin cycle<br>
Other names for light-independent reactions include the Calvin cycle, the Calvin-Benson cycle, and dark reactions.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-requirements-of-light-independent-reactions>What are the requirements of light-independent reactions?</h2>
<p>The requirements or ingredients for light-independent reactions are carbon dioxide and energy in the form of ATP and NADPH.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-needed-for-light-independent-reactions>What is needed for light-independent reactions?</h2>
<p>The ultimate goal of the light-independent reactions (or Calvin cycle) is to assemble a molecule of glucose. This is the part of photosynthesis that requires the CO2 the plant gets from the air. Essentially, the plant needs the carbon from the CO2 to create the building blocks for glucose.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-light-dependent-reactions-occur-in-the-cell>Where do light dependent reactions occur in the cell?</h2>
<p>These reactions occur on the thylakoid membranes. The light independent reactions consist of the Calvin cycle where CO 2 is fixed by combining with RuBP to form 2GP, and then uses the products of the light dependent reactions to form GALP, which can be converted into many different products.

<p>The light independent reactions consist of the Calvin cycle where CO 2 is fixed by combining with RuBP to form 2GP, and then uses the products of the light dependent reactions to form GALP, which can be converted into many different products.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-process-of-photosynthesis-light-dependent-or-light-independent>Is the process of photosynthesis light dependent or light independent?</h2>
<p>The process of photosynthesis is made up of light dependent reactions (the photo’ part) and sugar making or light independent reactions (the synthesis part). Here is an explanation in technical terms: To begin with water is taken up by the roots and circulated by veins to the leaves.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-light-reaction-of-photosynthesis-take-place>Where does the light reaction of photosynthesis take place?</h2>
<p>In light reaction of photosynthesis, a plant converts energy from one form to another from solar energy to potential energy to chemical energy. 2. The location of light reaction is in the thylakoid membranes. It starts with absorbing energy from the sunlight, followed by a series of events and ultimately the generation of ATP molecules takes place.</p>
