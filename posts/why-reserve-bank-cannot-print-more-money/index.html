<h2 id=why-reserve-bank-cannot-print-more-money>Why Reserve Bank Cannot print more money?</h2>
<p>Monetisation of fiscal deficit refers to the purchase of government bonds by the central bank, i.e. the Reserve Bank of India. Since the central bank creates fresh money by simply printing to buy these bonds, in layman’s language, monetisation of deficit means printing more money.</p>
<h2 id=can-rbi-print-as-much-money-as-it-wants>Can RBI print as much money as it wants?</h2>
<p>So, in order to increase the economy, the country should increase production. The government and RBI should work in maintaining the balance between production and currency rotation in the hands of people. So, printing money can’t be solution to raise the economy.</p>
<h2 id=why-cant-govt-print-more-currency>Why can’t Govt print more currency?</h2>
<p>Bottom line is, no government can print money to get out of a recession or downturn. The deeper reason for this is that money is really a facilitator of exchange between people, a middleman in a trade. If goods could trade with goods directly, without a middleman, we would not need money.</p>
<h2 id=why-cant-india-print-unlimited-money>Why can’t India print unlimited money?</h2>
<p>Yes, Inflation is the basic reason why a country or government does not print unlimited notes. Now let’s try to understand it with the help of following examples: When a whole country try to get richer by printing more money, it rarely works. This is because if everyone has ubiquitous money, prices go up instead.</p>
<h2 id=what-will-happen-if-rbi-prints-more-money>What will happen if RBI prints more money?</h2>
<p>If the RBI prints new currency then the supply of currency will increase in the country which will further increase the inflation in the country. Suppose if the money supply increased to 50% then the price of general prices like bread, butter, clothing, house etc. will also increase proportionately 50%.</p>
<h2 id=what-if-we-print-more-money>What if we print more money?</h2>
<p>Printing more money doesn’t increase economic output – it only increases the amount of cash circulating in the economy. If more money is printed, consumers are able to demand more goods, but if firms have still the same amount of goods, they will respond by putting up prices.</p>
<h2 id=why-countries-cant-just-print-money>Why countries can’t just print money?</h2>
<p>So why can’t governments just print money in normal times to pay for their policies? The short answer is inflation. Historically, when countries have simply printed money it leads to periods of rising prices — there’s too many resources chasing too few goods.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-can-reserve-bank-of-india-print>How much money can Reserve Bank of India print?</h2>
<p>The Reserve Bank has the right to print currency up to 10,000 rupee notes. However, if the Reserve Bank wants to print anything higher, the government must amend the Reserve Bank of India Act.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-reserve-bank-print-more-currency-notes>Why did the Reserve Bank print more currency notes?</h2>
<p>So, they thought of printing more currency notes. Reserve Bank of country XYZ has printed more currency notes and so, the salary of 10 people in the country has increased by 10/-. So, now the annual income of each person in the country became 20/-.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-rbi-print-unlimited-currency-in-india>Why does RBI print unlimited currency in India?</h2>
<p>Originally Answered: Currency is printed by the RBI in India.Then Why doesn’t it print unlimited currency to eradicate poverty completely? Because more currency will not mean more production and more supply. If a person has more money, he will demand more commodities and services.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-no-restrictions-on-printing-money>Why are there no restrictions on printing money?</h2>
<p>There are no restrictions on printing money on any government. Then why don’t governments print as much currency notes as they like? The answer is Inflation. You see, the currency notes that we use do not have any intrinsic value. They only have exchange value.</p>
