<h2 id=what-subjects-do-they-do-in-mexico>What subjects do they do in Mexico?</h2>
<p>The national curriculum includes Spanish, mathematics, social studies, natural sciences, civics, arts, and physical education. Each class is assigned one teacher that instructs all subjects throughout the year.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-i-need-to-study-in-mexico>What do I need to study in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Passport (must be valid and legible, you only need to upload the page containing your information). Academic Transcript or Proof of studies no more than 6 months old with grades average of 80 (Mexican system) or equivalent to 2.9 GPA (American system). Recommendation Letter.</p>
<h2 id=is-studying-in-mexico-worth-it>Is studying in Mexico worth it?</h2>
<p>It’s not good in Mexico. Mexico is ranked about number 48 among OECD countries in the world. The big reason is that education is highly underfunded. Mexico is required by law to provide textbooks to all students, but in fact many students do not receive them, for example.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-university-like-in-mexico>What is university like in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Higher education in Mexico follows a similar format to universities in Europe and the US with bachelor’s (licenciatura) degrees taking four years to complete, while master’s (maestría) degrees last two years and a PhD (doctorado) is three years long.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-requirements-to-study-in-mexico>What are the requirements to study in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Academic Transcript or Proof of studies no more than 6 months old with grades average of 80 (Mexican system) or equivalent to 2.9 GPA (American system). Recommendation Letter. First tuition payment, in order to receive your acceptance letter. Online fee of $1,400 MX (non-refundable fee).</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-university-to-study-in-mexico>Which is the best university to study in Mexico?</h2>
<p>The Tecnológico de Monterrey also offers a number of undergraduate classes taught in English. These are for international students studying for a semester or year abroad and can be used to provide credits towards a degree at the student’s home university.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-before-going-to-mexico>What do you need to know before going to Mexico?</h2>
<p>If you’re thinking of heading abroad to study in Mexico, you’ll want to do your research beforehand. From tips on how to visit Mexico safely, to advice on transport and local customs, here’s everything important you should know before your plane leaves.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-easy-to-become-a-doctor-in-mexico>Is it easy to become a doctor in Mexico?</h2>
<p>In some cases, it is quite easy to study abroad and then practice as a doctor in the US. At other times, the requirements for being considered a doctor may not be rigorous enough when measured by either standards in the US, or standards abroad. Becoming a doctor in Mexico requires many of the same steps as in the United States.</p>
