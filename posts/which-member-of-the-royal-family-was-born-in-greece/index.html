<p>The Greek royal family (Greek: Ελληνική Βασιλική Οικογένεια) is a branch of the Danish royal family, itself a branch of the House of Glücksburg, that reigned in Greece from 1863 to 1924 and again from 1935 to 1973.

<p>Theodora was born in 9 June 1983 at St Mary’s Hospital, London.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-theodora-of-cyprus-born-and-raised>Where was Theodora of Cyprus born and raised?</h2>
<p>There are several indications of her possible birthplace. According to Michael the Syrian her birthplace was in Mabbug, Syria; Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopoulos names Theodora a native of Cyprus, while the Patria, attributed to George Codinus, claims Theodora came from Paphlagonia. She was born c. 500 AD.</p>

<p>Her father, Acacius, was a bear keeper at the Hippodrome (circus) in Constantinople. Procopius says that she became an actress and prostitute while still young, leading an unconventional life that included giving birth to at least one child out of wedlock.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-theodora-live-in-the-byzantine-empire>Where did Theodora live in the Byzantine Empire?</h2>
<p>Later, Theodora traveled to North Africa as the concubine of a Syrian official named Hecebolus when he went to the Libyan Pentapolis as governor. Abandoned and maltreated by Hecebolus, on her way back to the capital of the Byzantine Empire, she settled for a while in Alexandria, Egypt .</p>
