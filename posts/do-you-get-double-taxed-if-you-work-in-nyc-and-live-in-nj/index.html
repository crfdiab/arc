<h2 id=do-you-get-double-taxed-if-you-work-in-nyc-and-live-in-nj>Do you get double taxed if you work in NYC and live in NJ?</h2>
<p>Do You Need to Pay Taxes in Both NY and NJ? Yes and no. You won’t have to pay New York City taxes, and you won’t be fully double taxed on your state income. Your employer will have withheld New York state taxes throughout the year, and you will then gain a New Jersey tax credit back for those taxes.</p>
<h2 id=which-taxes-are-higher-ny-or-nj>Which taxes are higher NY or NJ?</h2>
<p>While both New York and New Jersey have relatively high income taxes, New Jersey’s lowest income tax rate is 1.4 percent while New York’s is 4 percent. The lowest tax bracket is also wider in New Jersey than in the Empire State, as of 2018.</p>
<h2 id=do-new-yorkers-pay-state-tax>Do New Yorkers pay state tax?</h2>
<p>New York City and Yonkers have their own local income tax on top of the state tax. New York City income tax rates are 3.078%, 3.762%, 3.819% and 3.876%….New York state income tax rates and tax brackets.</p>
<table><tr><th>Tax rate</th><th>Taxable income bracket</th><th>Tax owed</th></tr><tr><td>4.5%</td><td>$8,501 to $11,700</td><td>$340 plus 4.5% of the amount over $8,500</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-pay-nyc-tax-if-you-dont-live-in-nyc>Do you have to pay NYC tax if you don’t live in NYC?</h2>
<p>Nonresidents of New York City are not liable for New York City personal income tax. The rules regarding New York City domicile are also the same as for New York State domicile.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-live-in-nj-and-work-in-ny>What happens if you live in NJ and work in NY?</h2>
<p>You’ll need to file as a non-resident to pay NJ taxes on wages earned in the state, AND file as a resident to pay NY taxes. However, you’ll receive a tax credit on your NY taxes for “income taxes paid to other jurisdictions” – so you’re not being taxed double on wages from NJ.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-salary-cap-for-the-new-york-jets>What is the salary cap for the New York Jets?</h2>
<p>An updated look at the New York Jets 2021 salary cap table, including team cap space, dead cap figures, and complete breakdowns of player cap hits, salaries, and bonuses. Restruc. Bonus Injured players who will miss the remainder of the season.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-contracts-of-the-new-york-jets>What are the contracts of the New York Jets?</h2>
<p>Contract terms for all active New York Jets players, including average salary, reported guarantees, free agency year, and contract length & value. From Prac. Squad (NYJ) From Prac.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-nfl-players-get-different-tax-checks>Why do NFL players get different tax checks?</h2>
<p>And each away-game check can be different, based on the income tax rate of the state they’re playing in. For example, if the Jets play a game in Florida against the Miami Dolphins, the Jets players’ checks will be higher than if it were a home game, since Florida has no income tax and New York does.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-the-jets-play-in-florida>What happens if the Jets play in Florida?</h2>
<p>For example, if the Jets play a game in Florida against the Miami Dolphins, the Jets players’ checks will be higher than if it were a home game, since Florida has no income tax and New York does. But the players may need to make up the difference on their taxes.</p>
