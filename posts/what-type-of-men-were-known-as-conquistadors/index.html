<h2 id=what-type-of-men-were-known-as-conquistadors>What type of men were known as conquistadors?</h2>
<p>Definition of Conquistador The word conquistador comes from Spanish and means “he who conquers.” The conquistadors were those men who took up arms to conquer, subjugate, and convert native populations in the New World.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-soldiers-were-the-conquistadors>What type of soldiers were the conquistadors?</h2>
<p>Most conquistadors were heavy infantry, wearing iron cuirasses (breastplates) and helmets, as well as tassets to protect their thighs. Some wealthier men might have more complete arm and hand protection, and a few even wore suits of plate mail, although this was almost always restricted cavalry.</p>
<h2 id=did-conquistadors-use-pikes>Did conquistadors use pikes?</h2>
<p>Pikes and pikemen, a standard feature in many European armies at the time, were largely unnecessary in the New World due to the lack of enemy horsemen.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-most-famous-of-the-conquistadors>Who was the most famous of the conquistadors?</h2>
<p>Hernan Cortes – perhaps the most famous of all the conquistadors, Cortes led the expedition which toppled the Aztec empire, and saw the conquest of Mexico in the name of the King of Castile. Part of Cortes’ success can be attributed to his tactic of allying himself with indigenous people to defeat common enemies.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-spanish-call-themselves-the-conquistadors>Why did the Spanish call themselves the conquistadors?</h2>
<p>They came to be known as the conquistadors. Who were these men? The word conquistador comes from Spanish and means “he who conquers.” The conquistadors were those men who took up arms to conquer, subjugate, and convert native populations in the New World.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-last-spanish-conquistador-to-return-to-mexico>Who was the last Spanish conquistador to return to Mexico?</h2>
<p>The last of the great conquistador expeditions were mounted by Francisco de Coronado in 1540. He was pursuing rumors of gold among Indian cities on the Great Plains. He returned to Mexico empty-handed and financially ruined in 1542, having wandered with his 300 Spanish mercenaries, with no purpose, as far north as modern-day Kansas.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-the-footmen-in-the-conquistadors>What was the role of the footmen in the conquistadors?</h2>
<p>Footmen, harquebusiers, cavalry, and so on served under trusted captains who were responsible to the expedition leader. Expeditions, such as Pizarro’s Inca campaign or the countless searches for the city of El Dorado, were expensive and privately financed (although the King still expected his 20 percent cut of any valuables discovered).</p>
