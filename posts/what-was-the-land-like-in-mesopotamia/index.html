<h2 id=what-was-the-land-like-in-mesopotamia>What was the land like in Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>The land is quite fertile due to seasonal rains, and the rivers and streams flowing from the mountains. Early settlers farmed the land and used timber, metals and stone from the mountains nearby. Southern Mesopotamia is made up of marshy areas and wide, flat, barren plains.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-positive-effects-of-geography-on-mesopotamia>What were the positive effects of geography on Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>In ancient times, it was easier to travel by boat than over land. Few roads existed during this time. Also, because of the rivers, this area had arich supply of fish and waterfowl that could be used for food. The land in this area was flat and fertile, rich in nutrients.</p>
<h2 id=did-mesopotamians-believe-in-life-after-death>Did Mesopotamians believe in life after death?</h2>
<p>Afterlife. The ancient Mesopotamians believed in an afterlife that was a land below our world. It was this land, known alternately as Arallû, Ganzer or Irkallu, the latter of which meant “Great Below”, that it was believed everyone went to after death, irrespective of social status or the actions performed during life.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-mesopotamia-a-good-place-to-live>Why was Mesopotamia a good place to live?</h2>
<p>The early settlers of Mesopotamia decided that this land was a good place to live because they were close to two pretty big rivers. Say their names out loud (look at the top if you need a refresher on how to say their names). Rivers give you fresh water to drink.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-agricultural-revolution-affect-ancient-mesopotamia>How did the Agricultural Revolution affect ancient Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>The Fertile Crescent was not always so dry and barren. The agricultural revolution allowed the overuse and erosion of soil as more and more land was irrigated. The inefficient use of the land and the growing Mesopotamian population depleted the water supply.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-important-river-in-mesopotamia>Which is the most important river in Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>Map showing the extent of Mesopotamia. The geography of Mesopotamia, encompassing its ethnology and history, centered on the two great rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-in-ancient-mesopotamia-have-flat-roofs>Why did people in ancient Mesopotamia have flat roofs?</h2>
<p>All had flat roofs. Some roofs were designed with four wall for privacy. Some had grape arbors for food, privacy, and shelter from the sun. Even the very poor, who lived in tiny townhouses, typically had three levels of living space. The courtyard, or first floor, in each house was very important.</p>
