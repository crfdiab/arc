<h2 id=do-all-branches-of-government-have-the-same-power>Do all branches of government have the same power?</h2>
<p>Branches of Government Because each branch has both individual and shared powers, no one branch has more authority than the other two, and each is accountable to the others. This “checks and balances” system means that the balance of power in our government remains steady.</p>
<h2 id=which-branch-is-the-strongest-in-government>Which branch is the strongest in government?</h2>
<p>The most important power of Congress is its legislative authority; with its ability to pass laws in areas of national policy. The laws that Congress creates are called statutory law. Most of the laws which are passed down by Congress apply to the public, and on some cases private laws.</p>

<p>the judiciary<br>
Alexander Hamilton once described the judiciary as the least dangerous branch of government, since it controlled no armies and lacked spending power. This has inspired constitutional designers to try to empower independent courts to check other branches.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-powers-of-each-of-the-3-branches-of-government>What are the powers of each of the 3 branches of government?</h2>
<p>Branches of Government. To ensure a separation of powers, the U.S. Federal Government is made up of three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. To ensure the government is effective and citizens’ rights are protected, each branch has its own powers and responsibilities, including working with the other branches.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-branches-of-government-are-there-in-the-us>How many branches of government are there in the US?</h2>

<h2 id=which-is-branch-of-government-has-the-most-power>Which is branch of government has the most power?</h2>

<h2 id=how-are-the-powers-of-the-federal-government-defined-in-the-constitution>How are the powers of the federal government defined in the Constitution?</h2>

The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court.</p>
