<h2 id=can-you-sue-someone-for-something-that-happened-years-ago>Can you sue someone for something that happened years ago?</h2>
<p>Yes, there are definite time limits to file a lawsuit. It depends entirely upon the state you’re in (or federal law) and what the offense is. Some claims may expire as quickly as a year after the event in question took place. Other claims can be filed decades later (tax fraud, for instance).</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-sue-someone-who-owes-me-money-in-california>How do I sue someone who owes me money in California?</h2>
<p>If you decide to go to court, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Figure Out How to Name the Defendant.</li>
<li>Ask for Payment.</li>
<li>Find the Right Court to File Your Claim.</li>
<li>Fill Out Your Court Forms.</li>
<li>File Your Claim.</li>
<li>Serve Your Claim.</li>
<li>Go to Court.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=can-i-sue-someone-that-owes-me-money-and-refuses-to-pay>Can I sue someone that owes me money and refuses to pay?</h2>
<p>If someone owes you money and they refuse to pay, you can file a lawsuit with small claims court. You can try mediation or some other alternative to going to court. Or you can write a “demand letter” that states what is owed and that says you plan to go to court to collect the debt.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-sue-someone-for-something-they-did-10-years-ago>Can you sue someone for something they did 10 years ago?</h2>
<p>In many cases, you cannot sue after a certain period of time has gone by. This is called a limitation period. If you are suing for injuries or damages caused to yourself or your property, for example an assault or a car accident, the time limit is generally 2 years from the date of injury or damage.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-call-the-cops-on-someone-who-owes-you-money>Can you call the cops on someone who owes you money?</h2>
<p>The quick answer is no, you can’t go to the police if someone owes you money. Unless there’s a risk of violence or public disruption associated with your personal debt, the police will not get involved. You should never call 911 or an emergency police number to complain about civil matters such as a debt.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-i-do-if-someone-owes-me-money-and-refuses-to-pay>What can I do if someone owes me money and refuses to pay?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Contacting the person or company who owes you money. Speak to the person who owes you money.</li>
<li>Using mediation to settle a debt dispute.</li>
<li>Using a solicitor.</li>
<li>Using a debt recovery agency.</li>
<li>Recovering debts through the courts.</li>
<li>Claiming online.</li>
<li>More useful links.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=can-you-sue-if-you-have-no-money>Can you sue if you have no money?</h2>
<p>Even if you do not have the money to pay the debt, always go to court when you are told to go. A creditor or debt collector can win a lawsuit against you even if you are penniless. The lawsuit is not based on whether you can pay—it is based on whether you owe the specific debt amount to that particular plaintiff.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-statute-of-limitations-on-suing-someone>What’s the Statute of limitations on suing someone?</h2>
<p>Here are the statutes of limitations for some common types of legal disputes: If you are suing because you got hurt, you can file a claim for up to 2 years after you were hurt. If you are suing because a spoken agreement was broken, you have 2 years to file after the agreement was broken.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-sue-someone-for-unlimited-amount-of-money>Can you sue someone for unlimited amount of money?</h2>
<p>While Supreme Courts can decide cases suing for an unlimited amount of money. For help learning which court to start your case go to The Right Court for Your Problem. If you want to start your case in Small Claims Court (cases up to $10,000), the information in this section is not right for you.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-sue-in-small-claims-court>How old do you have to be to sue in Small Claims Court?</h2>
<p>You are not allowed to have a lawyer represent you at the hearing in small claims court. But you can talk to a lawyer before or after court. You can sue in small claims court if you are: At least 18 years old, OR</p>
<h2 id=how-long-to-file-claim-with-small-claims-court>How long to file claim with small claims court?</h2>
<p>If no decision is made with 45 days, then the claim is considered denied. If they reject your claim, you have 6 months to file a claim with a small claims court.</p>
