<h2 id=why-is-it-difficult-to-climb-mountain>Why is it difficult to climb mountain?</h2>
<p>Climbing mountains often requires scrambling and rock climbing to be done which requires a lot of energy to be used carrying the equipment. It then also takes more time and energy to scramble or (rock) climb the distance, due to gear placements.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-harder-going-up-or-down-a-mountain>Is it harder going up or down a mountain?</h2>
<p>Going down a mountain is often far more difficult that climbing it. You start to understand the mountain. You’re no longer looking up at the summit, but retracing your steps with greater care and attention than you gave them on your way up. And that’s when you can see the beauty.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-climbing-everest-difficult>What makes climbing Everest difficult?</h2>
<p>Altitude sickness Everest climb. It gets caused by less amount of oxygen and air pressure that will affect your health. The higher you go up the trail, the lesser oxygen there is in the air. The Death Zone above 8,000m has minimal oxygen and thus many climbers require additional oxygen on this climb.</p>
<h2 id=which-mountain-is-difficult-to-climb>Which mountain is difficult to climb?</h2>
<p>At 28,251 feet, K2, which straddles the Pakistan-China border, is about two and a half football fields shorter than Everest, but it’s widely considered the planet’s toughest and most dangerous mountain to climb, earning the nickname “Savage Mountain.” Unlike Everest, it is not possible to “walk” to the top; all sides …</p>
<h2 id=why-is-easier-to-go-down-a-mountain-than-to-go-up>Why is easier to go down a mountain than to go up?</h2>
<p>Climbing down steep rock is usually harder than going up, because of the difficulty in seeing holds from above and the normal reluctance of climbers to reach down and work their hands low enough as they descend. The quick way down is via the doubled rope in the technique called rappelling.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-climbing-up-easier-than-climbing-down>Why is climbing up easier than climbing down?</h2>
<p>It’s generally harder to see footholds when down climbing, especially on less than vertical surfaces. Your eyes tend to be closer to the wall, and it’s often hard to see your proper footing. When moving upwards, those footholds are closer, and it’s often easier to lean away from the face.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-more-difficult-to-climb-a-mountain-than-a-hill>Why is it more difficult to climb a mountain than a hill?</h2>
<p>The main reason for the mountain being difficult to climb to a hill is that the altitude is higher of the mountain and there is a lack of oxygen. The oxygen gets thinner and thinner as we go up higher.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-living-in-the-mountains>What are the pros and cons of living in the mountains?</h2>
<p>If you’re planning on moving up in altitude and living the mountain life, just be sure you know all of the pros and cons first. Here are some to consider. From forested slopes to desert peaks, if you’re living in the mountains, you’re living in a place of idyllic beauty.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-weather-like-up-in-the-mountains>What’s the weather like up in the mountains?</h2>
<p>Weather has a way of being just a little bit more dramatic when you’re up high. Winds whip harder, the cold is more biting, and, depending on where you are, conditions can present a high risk of wildfire.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-build-a-house-on-a-mountain>Is it possible to build a house on a mountain?</h2>
<p>Building a new house on a mountain or adding on to an existing one is incredibly difficult and incredibly expensive. If you’re starting from scratch, you’ll have to cut down trees, level the land with dynamite, and run in utilities, and that’s before you’ve even gotten to the foundation of your home.</p>
