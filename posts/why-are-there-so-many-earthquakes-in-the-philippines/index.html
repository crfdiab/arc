<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-earthquakes-in-the-philippines>Why are there so many earthquakes in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>The Philippines’ location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and its close distance from the equator makes the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons. Underneath the Phillipines, to the East, lies a tectonic plate called the Philippine Sea Plate. What is an Earthquake and how is it caused?</p>
<h2 id=why-are-earthquakes-so-common-in-the-pacific-ocean>Why are earthquakes so common in the Pacific Ocean?</h2>
<p>Ring Of Fire is a name for areas that often experience earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that surround the Pacific Ocean basin. This area is the region most experienced earthquake in because of continuous plate movement.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-earthquakes-in-indonesia>Why are there so many earthquakes in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>This is caused by the hot liquid rock (magma) that exits through the slit of the plate and then hardened on the surface to form cones that cause the emergence of volcanoes in the plates. That factor causes Indonesia prone to earthquake.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-most-earthquakes-in-the-world-occur>Where do most earthquakes in the world occur?</h2>
<p>Earthquakes usually occur on the border of the plates and the most severe earthquakes usually occur on the border of the plate. Some other earthquakes may also occur due to magma movements inside the volcano. Such an earthquake can be a symptom of a volcanic eruption.</p>

<h2 id=is-the-philippines-part-of-the-pacific-ring-of-fire>Is the Philippines part of the Pacific Ring of fire?</h2>
<p>The Philippines, officially known as the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean, consisting of 7,107 islands. The Philippines’ location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and its close distance from the equator makes the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-last-earthquake-in-the-philippines>Where was the last earthquake in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Koronadal City, South Cotabato, Philippines / MMI IV (Light shaking): Surprising. After our island (Mindanao) was attacked by series of strong earthquakes last October, it returned again since we thought that the earthquake series had ended. If you want to see videos.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-philippines-prone-to-typhoons-and-floods>Why is the Philippines prone to typhoons and floods?</h2>
<p>Since constructions experts have already brought to light the reasons why Philippines is prone to typhoon, they can now focus on what will keep a structure remain standing after the storm has settled. Here are some essential tips for buildings that can withstand heavy winds, rain, and floods.</p>
