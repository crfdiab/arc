<h2 id=how-many-colonies-are-in-antarctica>How many colonies are in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>There are now 61 known emperor colonies around Antarctica. “There may be one or two very small colonies yet to be discovered, but I think we have filled in all the gaps now,” said Fretwell.</p>
<h2 id=why-antarctica-is-not-suitable-for-human-settlement>Why Antarctica is not suitable for human settlement?</h2>

<p>Southernmost settlements are cities, towns, weather stations or permanent military bases which are further south than latitude 45°S. They are closely related to the Southern Ocean or either the Roaring Forties or Furious Fifties. There are many research stations in Antarctica, both permanent and summer only.</p>

<h2 id=are-there-any-towns-or-villages-in-antarctica>Are there any towns or villages in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Only two civilian settlements exist in Antarctica with a lowly population consisting of just a couple of scientists and their families. These aren’t your run-of-the-mill towns for millions of tourists to descend upon annually. In fact, most people that come to visit the southern continent are more often than not bound to their ships.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-permanent-settlements-at-the-south-pole>Are there any permanent settlements at the South Pole?</h2>
<p>The US also has a base at the South Pole, the Australians have a several bases at Casey and Mawson. Busy place in the summer:) Antarctica has no permanent settlements because it is a frozen windswept continent with hostile environment. Scientists research stations are only temporary inhabitants.</p>
