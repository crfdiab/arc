<h2 id=what-did-admiral-mahan-say-the-us-needed-to-do-to-be-a-world-power>What did Admiral Mahan say the US needed to do to be a world power?</h2>
<p>Alfred Mahan was a naval officer who studied large empires and found that empires such as Great Britain would not have gained there strength without the navy. He thought navy wasn’t just important for trade but also for the U.S. as a world power and an empire.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-mahan-say-the-us-needed-to-expand>Why did Mahan say the US needed to expand?</h2>
<p>Mahan believed that the United States could follow the same guidelines and emerge as a world power. Furthermore, for the United States to expand its markets abroad, it had to have its navy situated to defend its interests. In addition, an isthmian canal was needed in the Western Hemisphere to shorten trade distances.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-alfred-mahan-believe-it-was-necessary-for-the-united-states-to-have-a-strong-modern-navy-in-the-late-1800s>Why did Alfred Mahan believe it was necessary for the United States to have a strong modern navy in the late 1800s?</h2>
<p>Mahan argued that to truly protect the trade interests and industrial power of the US, they needed to create a strong navy to protect shipping. Therefore he argued the US needed to get colonies so they could create naval bases on the colonies.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-alfred-t-mahan-argue-the-us-needed-to-do-to-be-a-powerful-nation>What did Alfred T Mahan argue the US needed to do to be a powerful nation?</h2>
<p>Mahan, a naval strategist and the author of The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, argued that national prosperity and power depended on control of the world’s sea-lanes. To become a major naval power, the United States began to replace its wooden sailing ships with steel vessels powered by coal or oil in 1883.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-alfred-t-mahan-suggest>What did Alfred T Mahan suggest?</h2>
<p>Mahan argued that British control of the seas, combined with a corresponding decline in the naval strength of its major European rivals, paved the way for Great Britain’s emergence as the world’s dominant military, political, and economic power.</p>
<h2 id=was-mahan-an-imperialist>Was Mahan an imperialist?</h2>
<p>These works made Alfred Thayer Mahan one of the leading spokesmen for the age of imperialism. He downplayed the philanthropic side of overseas involvement and concentrated on harsh political realities. Alfred Thayer Mahan also argued that modern navies needed repair and coaling stations.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-mahan-important-to-the-united-states>Why was Mahan important to the United States?</h2>
<p>Mahan believed that the U.S. economy would soon be unable to absorb the massive amounts of industrial and commercial goods being produced domestically, and he argued that the United States should seek new markets abroad. What concerned Mahan most was ensuring that the U.S. Government could guarantee access to these new international markets.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-gunnar-myrdal-say-in-an-american-dilemma>What did Gunnar Myrdal say in an American Dilemma?</h2>
<p>What Gunnar Myrdal said in An American Dilemma remains true today: “America is free to chose whether the Negro shall remain her liability or become her opportunity.” Chapter I. The Negro American Revolution. Chapter II. The Negro American Family. Chapter III. The Roots of the Problem.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-navy-important-in-time-of-war>Why is the Navy important in time of war?</h2>
<p>This protection in time of war must be extended by armed shipping. The necessity of a navy, in the restricted sense of the word, springs, therefore, from the existence of a peaceful shipping, and disappears with it, except in the case of a nation which has aggressive tendencies, and keeps up a navy merely as a branch of the military establishment.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-goal-of-the-moynihan-report>What was the goal of the Moynihan Report?</h2>
<p>A national effort is required that will give a unity of purpose to the many activities of the Federal government in this area, directed to a new kind of national goal: the establishment of a stable Negro family structure. This would be a new departure for Federal policy. And a difficult one.</p>
