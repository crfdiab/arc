<h2 id=on-which-continent-do-you-find-the-caspian-sea>On which continent do you find the Caspian Sea?</h2>
<p>The Caspian Sea is the Earth’s largest inland body of water, when measured by surface area. It lies at the junction of Europe and Asia, with the Caucasus Mountains to the west and the steppes of Central Asia to the east.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-caspian-sea-a-sea-and-not-a-lake>Why is the Caspian Sea a sea and not a lake?</h2>
<p>Caspian Sea. The Caspian Sea is the world’s largest inland sea. It is called a sea and not a lake because when the Ancient Romans arrived there, they discovered that the water was salty (about a third as salty as regular seawater); they named the sea after the Caspian tribe that lived there.</p>
<h2 id=is-caspian-sea-water-drinkable>Is Caspian Sea water Drinkable?</h2>
<p>Lake’s water is drinkable or saltish, while the sea contains only salty water. The Caspian Sea is located between the continents of Europe and Asia.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-countries-on-the-caspian-sea>Where are the countries on the Caspian Sea?</h2>
<p>The lake is endorheic (meaning it has no outflows), and sits at the border between Europe and Asia. The countries on its shores are Kazakhstan to the NE, Russia to the NW, Azerbaijan to the West, Iran to the South and Turkmenistan to the SE. The Caucasus Mountains are located West of the Caspian Sea,…</p>

<p>The lake has several small islands with a total area of approximately 2,000 km2 (or 770 sq mi), which are mainly located in the Northern Caspian. Noteworthy here is the Tyuleniy Archipelago, which is an Important Bird Area (IBA). However its the largest island, Ogurja Ada, is located in the Southern Caspian.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-the-caspian-sea-in-years>How old is the Caspian Sea in years?</h2>
<p>Iran, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Russia and Kazakhstan are the five countries that surround the sea and on its shores are a number of different cities such as Baku, Aktau and Majachkalá. According to historians and geographers it is considered that the sea is approximately 30 million years old.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-seals-live-in-the-caspian-sea>What kind of seals live in the Caspian Sea?</h2>
