<h2 id=who-owns-the-amazon-river>Who owns the Amazon River?</h2>
<p>Brazil<br>
Nine countries share the Amazon basin—most of the rainforest, 58.4%, is contained within the borders of Brazil. The other eight countries include Peru with 12.8%, Bolivia with 7.7%, Colombia with 7.1%, Venezuela with 6.1%, Guyana with 3.1%, Suriname with 2.5%, French Guyana with 1.4%, and Ecuador with 1%.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-amazon-river-being-destroyed>How is the Amazon River being destroyed?</h2>
<p>Cattle ranching is the leading cause of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. In Brazil, this has been the case since at least the 1970s: government figures attributed 38 percent of deforestation from 1966-1975 to large-scale cattle ranching. Today the figure in Brazil is closer to 70 percent.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-government-doing-to-protect-the-amazon-river>What is the government doing to protect the Amazon River?</h2>
<p>Though the President has passed several executive orders and laws to protect the Amazon, he has simultaneously slashed funding to government-run environmental protection and monitoring programs, and pushed to open indigenous lands to commercial farming and mining.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-countries-make-up-the-amazon-drainage-basin>How many countries make up the Amazon drainage basin?</h2>
<p>eight countries<br>
the Amazon River Basin, agreed by the eight countries, with the main environmental issues, their possible root causes, and “hot spots” within the Basin defined and identified at the subbasin level.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-responsible-for-deforestation-of-the-amazon-river>Who is responsible for deforestation of the Amazon River?</h2>
<p>The cattle industry in Brazil plays a major role and is responsible for approximately 80 percent of Amazon deforestation, according to a 2009 report by The Guardian. In this land of impassable jungles and limited roadways, the Amazon River is still a primary mode of transportation for many individuals, particularly the indigenous people.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-goal-of-the-amazon-river-initiative>What is the goal of the Amazon River initiative?</h2>
<p>The Amazon Waters Initiative’s goal is to maintain the integrity of the vast, interlinked and dynamic Amazon freshwater system in order to support human wellbeing, wildlife and the environments on which they depend. Within the framework of integrated river basin management, this will require action in three areas:</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-amazon-rainforest-related-to-the-amazon-river>How is the Amazon rainforest related to the Amazon River?</h2>
<p>Amazon rainforest The Amazon River is intricately connected to the delicate ecosystem of the Amazon rainforest — the largest rainforest on Earth, covering approximately two-thirds of the Amazon River basin. The Amazon rainforest is home to more than one-third of all known species in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-uses-of-the-amazon-river>What are the uses of the Amazon River?</h2>
<p>There are also rose woods, Tonka bean woods and other scented trees that are used in making perfumes and other scented products. A lot of land along the Amazon River has been turned to commercial farming purposes. This is because there are parts of the river basin which are highly fertile.</p>
