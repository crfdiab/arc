<h2 id=why-are-hot-deserts-found-in-the-tropics>Why are hot deserts found in the tropics?</h2>
<p>The air warms up. Any moisture in the air is held as water vapour (invisible). Because the tropics are largely cloudless they get very hot during the day. There are few clouds to insulate these areas during the night.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-hot-deserts-to-the-north-and-south-of-the-tropics>Why are there hot deserts to the north and south of the tropics?</h2>
<p>Subtropical deserts are caused by the circulation patterns of air masses. They are found along the Tropic of Cancer, between 15 and 30 degrees north of the Equator, or along the Tropic of Capricorn, between 15 and 30 degrees south of the Equator. Hot, moist air rises into the atmosphere near the Equator.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-deserts-form-on-the-western-side-of-continents>Why do deserts form on the western side of continents?</h2>
<p>Some deserts are found on the western edges of continents. They are caused by cold ocean currents, which run along the coast. They cool the air and make it harder for the air to hold moisture. Most moisture falls as rain before it reaches the land, eg the Namib Desert in Africa.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-most-of-world-deserts-located-in-the-western-margins-of>Why are most of world deserts located in the western margins of?</h2>
<p>Answer: Most of the worlds deserts are located in the western margins of continents in the subtropics because the prevailing winds in the tropics are tropical easterly winds. The tropical easterly winds become dry by the time they reach the western margins of the continents and so they bring no rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-some-of-the-major-hot-deserts-of-the-world-located>Where are some of the major hot deserts of the world located?</h2>
<p>1. Explain the reasons as to why some of the major hot deserts of the world are located on the western margins of the continents? (250 words) Reference: Certificate of Human and Physical Geography by G.C Leong. [InstaMotivation@9pm] How to remain Happy always?</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-deserts-located-in-the-subtropical-high-pressure-belt>Where are the deserts located in the subtropical high pressure belt?</h2>
<p>All the tropical deserts lie on the western side in subtropical high pressure belt, except for Somalia desert which is the only desert lying closest to equator and on eastern side of the deserts. Subtropical high pressure belt deserts lie on the western side of the continent and in the subtropics. They owe their origin to many factors. 1.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-most-of-the-deserts-in-the-world-rainless>Why are most of the deserts in the world rainless?</h2>
<p>The temperate deserts are rainless because of the interior location in the temperate lattitudes well away from rain bearing winds. The major hot deserts of the world are located on the West Coast of continents between latitude is 15 degree and 30 degree N and S.</p>
