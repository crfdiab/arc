<p>Nicholas ignored these warnings and Russia’s Tsarist regime collapsed a few months later during the February Revolution of 1917. One year later, the Tsar and his entire family were executed.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-during-the-1905-russian-revolution>What happened during the 1905 Russian revolution?</h2>
<p>The Russian Revolution of 1905, also known as the First Russian Revolution, was a wave of mass political and social unrest that spread through vast areas of the Russian Empire, some of which was directed at the government. It included worker strikes, peasant unrest, and military mutinies.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-tsar-survive-the-1905-revolution>How did the Tsar survive the 1905 Revolution?</h2>
<p>Despite the failure of Russia in the war against Japan, the Tsarist regime survived the revolution . There are a number of reasons for this. One of the most importants reason is that Nicholas II was very thanks to his military force. By the end of January there were more than 400,000 workers out on strike. The 1905 Revolution was underway.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-1905-revolution>What was the outcome of the 1905 Revolution?</h2>
<p>By the end of January there were more than 400,000 workers out on strike. The 1905 Revolution was underway. For the rest of the year the government had little control of events, as strikes, demonstrations, petitions, peasent uprisisings, students riots, and assassinations became commonplace. The Tsar was “at war with his own people”.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-tsar-at-war-with-his-own-people>Why was the Tsar at war with his own people?</h2>
<p>The Tsar was “at war with his own people”. People wanted a change because Nicholas II reign saw Imperial Russia go from being one of the great powers of the world to an economic and military disaster.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-tsar-nicholas-ii-prepare-for-the-russo-japanese-war>How did Tsar Nicholas II prepare for the Russo-Japanese War?</h2>
<p>Nicholas approached the Russo-Japanese war with confidence and saw it as an opportunity to raise Russian morale and patriotism, paying little attention to the finances of a long-distance war. Shortly before the Japanese attack on Port Arthur, Nicholas held strong to the belief that there would be no war.</p>
