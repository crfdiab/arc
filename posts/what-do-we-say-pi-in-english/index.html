<h2 id=what-do-we-say-pi-in-english>What do we say pi in English?</h2>
<p>The symbol used by mathematicians to represent the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter is the lowercase Greek letter π, sometimes spelled out as pi, and derived from the first letter of the Greek word perimetros, meaning circumference. In English, π is pronounced as “pie” (/paɪ/ PY).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-pi-pronounced-pee>Why is pi pronounced pee?</h2>
<p>Wikipedia’s article on Ancient Greek phonology has more details. The pronunciations have come to English via other languages (French/Latin), which have exerted their own influence. The pronunciations received from them went through the Great Vowel Shift, which probably explains the “pee”-versus-“pie” for “pi” aspect.</p>
<h2 id=is-pi-pronounced-pee>Is pi pronounced pee?</h2>
<p>The generally accepted pronunciation of phi is fi, like fly. Another noted that in Greek the letter PHI is indeed pronounced PHEE. However, in Greek the letter we call PI is also pronounced PEE.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-definition-of-pi>What is the best definition of pi?</h2>
<p>Succinctly, pi—which is written as the Greek letter for p, or π—is the ratio of the circumference of any circle to the diameter of that circle. Regardless of the circle’s size, this ratio will always equal pi. In decimal form, the value of pi is approximately 3.14.</p>
<h2 id=who-first-determined-pi>Who first determined pi?</h2>
<p>Archimedes of Syracuse<br>
The Egyptians calculated the area of a circle by a formula that gave the approximate value of 3.1605 for π. The first calculation of π was done by Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BC), one of the greatest mathematicians of the ancient world.</p>
<h2 id=is-phi-pronounced-fee>Is Phi pronounced fee?</h2>
<p>Following the correct Greek pronunciation, “Phi” is actually pronounced, “Fee.” It’s been claimed that the women’s fraternity adopted this rather than the anglicized “fie” because it sounded “more feminine.” Nothing screams sisterhood like making your title sound more fee-male.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-pi-help-us-in-life>How does pi help us in life?</h2>
<p>In basic mathematics, Pi is used to find area and circumference of a circle. You might not use it yourself every day, but Pi is used in most calculations for building and construction, quantum physics, communications, music theory, medical procedures, air travel, and space flight, to name a few.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-1618-mean>What does 1.618 mean?</h2>
<p>Golden Ratio<br>
Also known as the Golden Section, Golden Mean, Divine Proportion, or the Greek letter Phi, the Golden Ratio is a special number that approximately equals 1.618.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-oldest-sorority>What is the oldest sorority?</h2>
<p>The First To Be Called “Sorority”: Gamma Phi Beta Founded at Syracuse University in 1874, Gamma Phi Beta was the first women’s organization to be called a sorority.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-correct-definition-of-the-letter-pi>Which is the correct definition of the letter Pi?</h2>
