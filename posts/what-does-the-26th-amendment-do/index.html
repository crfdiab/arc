<h2 id=what-is-unique-about-the-27th-amendment>What is unique about the 27th amendment?</h2>
<p>The Twenty-Seventh Amendment has one of the most unusual histories of any amendment ever made to the U.S. Constitution.

The 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, is the longest amendment in the U.S. Constitution. The 14th Amendment gives citizenship rights to anyone who was born in the United States.

<h2 id=what-did-the-15th-amendment-to-the-constitution-say>What did the 15th Amendment to the constitution say?</h2>
<p>The amendment reads, “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” The 15th Amendment guaranteed African-American men the right to vote.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-full-text-of-the-26th-amendment>What is the full text of the 26th Amendment?</h2>
