<h2 id=who-was-the-first-settlers-in-the-caribbean>Who was the first settlers in the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>The first proper European settlement in the Caribbean began when Nicolás de Ovando, a faithful soldier from western Spain, settled about 2,500 Spanish colonists in eastern Hispaniola in 1502.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-most-of-the-caribbean-islands>Who discovered most of the Caribbean islands?</h2>
<p>On October 12, 1492, Italian explorer Christopher Columbus made landfall in what is now the Bahamas. Columbus and his ships landed on an island that the native Lucayan people called Guanahani. Columbus renamed it San Salvador.</p>
<h2 id=who-all-colonized-the-caribbean>Who all colonized the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>The four main colonial powers in the Caribbean were the Spanish, English, Dutch, and French. Other countries that held possession of various islands at different times were Portugal, Sweden, and Denmark.</p>
<h2 id=who-explored-the-caribbean-and-discovered-jamaica>Who explored the Caribbean and discovered Jamaica?</h2>
<p>Christopher Columbus<br>
On May 3, 1494, Christopher Columbus sighted the island of Jamaica. Spanish colonists settled the island fifteen years later, and it fell into British hands in 1655. Although the Spanish introduced slavery to Jamaica, the British oversaw its development.</p>
<h2 id=were-there-dinosaurs-in-the-caribbean>Were there dinosaurs in the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>We’re now in the mid-Cretaceous Period, about 100 million years ago, give or take a few million. Dinosaurs were still enjoying their global tropical sauna and our Caribbean neighbours of Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands were starting to stick their noses out of the water.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-discover-the-caribbean>Who was the first person to discover the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>History The islands of the Caribbean were discovered by the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus, working for the then Spanish monarchy. In 1492 he made a first landing on Hispaniola and claimed it for the Spanish crown as he did on Cuba.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-christopher-columbus-did-not-discover-the-caribbean>Is it true Christopher Columbus did not discover the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>Christopher Columbus did not discover the Caribbean. This is the truth, though it has been stamped down and twisted to benefit others throughout Caribbean history in order to cover the truth of their mission.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-spanish-settlement-in-the-caribbean>When was the first Spanish settlement in the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>In 1492, Christopher Columbus landed in the Caribbean and claimed the region for Spain. The following year, the first Spanish settlements were established in the Caribbean.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-curator-of-caribbean-archaeology-at-florida-museum-of-natural-history>Who is curator of Caribbean Archaeology at Florida Museum of Natural History?</h2>
<p>William F. Keegan is the curator of Caribbean archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History. L ocals in the Bahamas will tell you the best time for beachcombing is after a big storm. There’s a rumor, unconfirmed, that on one such beach trip, people found gold coins.</p>
