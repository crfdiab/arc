<h2 id=was-food-expensive-during-the-gold-rush>Was food expensive during the Gold Rush?</h2>
<p>As levels of gold production rose in the colony, levels of domestic food production fell. It was difficult and expensive transporting foodstuffs to the goldfields. As a result, the dietary staples of flour, tea, and sugar were expensive and could fetch exorbitant prices during shortages.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-did-tools-cost-during-the-gold-rush>How much did tools cost during the Gold Rush?</h2>
<p>Pans the miners used cost 20 cents before 1849, but soon rose to $8, or $246 in today’s dollars. Boots cost $6, or $185. A shovel went for $36, or more than $1,000. The price of eggs rose from $1 per egg to $3, or $92.56.</p>
<h2 id=who-got-rich-during-the-gold-rush-and-why>Who got rich during the Gold Rush and why?</h2>
<p>It was much more common for people to become wealthy by providing the miners with over-priced food, supplies and services. Sam Brannan was the great beneficiary of this new found wealth. Prices increased rapidly and during this period his store had a turnover of $150,000 a month (almost $4 million in today’s money).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-california-gold-rush>What was the impact of the California Gold Rush?</h2>
<p>Its impact on the history of the American West during the 19th century was immense. Over the next years, thousands of gold miners traveled to California to “strike it rich,” and, by the end of 1849, the population of California had swelled by more than 86,000 inhabitants. James Marshall and Sutter’s Mill</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-price-of-gold-go-up-or-down>What makes the price of gold go up or down?</h2>
<p>Three main external factors have a significant influence on the price of gold. 1. Supply and Demand The basic economic principle of supply and demand is a major influencer of all commodity prices. When gold demand is high and supplies of the precious metal are low, gold prices will rise.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-biggest-gold-rush-in-history>What was the biggest gold rush in history?</h2>
<p>California Gold Rush summary: The California Gold Rush was the largest mass migration in American history since it brought about 300,000 people to California. It all started on January 24, 1848, when James W. Marshall found gold on his piece of land at Sutter’s Mill in Coloma.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cost-of-a-dozen-eggs-in-the-gold-rush>What was the cost of a dozen eggs in the Gold Rush?</h2>
<p>A dozen eggs might cost you $90 at today’s prices; a pick axe would be the equivalent of $1,500; a pound of coffee $1,200 and a pair of boots as much as $3,000 when today you could get a decent pair for around $120. “Every newcomer in San Francisco is overtaken with a sense of complete bewilderment,” wrote Taylor.</p>
