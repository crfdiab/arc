<h2 id=does-dracula-eat>Does Dracula eat?</h2>
<p>Unlike previous incarnations, vampires do not feed from human blood, instead preferring substitutes such as ‘blood beaters’ and ‘near blood’. Though Dracula did state in the first film that he would have drained Johnny of all his blood for getting close to Mavis.</p>
<h2 id=who-does-dracula-feed-on>Who does Dracula feed on?</h2>
<p>It is from them that Dracula is able to enter the household and continue feeding on Lucy. When Lucy’s mother is sent a telegraph about her deteriorating condition. Dracula sends the Brides to intercept her carriage and kidnap her. The mother, along with Lucy, later are turned into two new vampire Brides.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-dracula-eat-blood>Why does Dracula eat blood?</h2>
<p>whenever Dracula is thirsty and needs energy at night he will suck humans blood so he could get stronger,refill his energy and have the strength to become a powerful vampire. And to be more clear vampires only suck blood at night because they cant stay awake during daylight and you’ll know why in the next slide.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-dracula-in-love-with>Who is Dracula in love with?</h2>
<p>Mina Harker<br>
In Anno Dracula, a 1992 novel by Kim Newman, the first in the Anno Dracula series, Mina Harker became a vampire and Dracula’s bride. The novel tells an alternate history in which Dracula marries Queen Victoria and rules England as her consort, and vampirism is widespread.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-did-dracula-eat-in-transylvania>What kind of food did Dracula eat in Transylvania?</h2>
<p>Pork, beef, lamb, and fish are very popular in this type of cuisine. Although we all know Dracula feasted on the blood of young virgins, here are 10 things he could’ve eaten in Transylvania if he’d considered expanding his palate. Caltabos. Shutterstock. Caltabos is a traditional Romanian Christmas dish.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-dracula-in-the-first-chapter-of-dracula>Where is Dracula in the first chapter of Dracula?</h2>
<p>Dracula is nowhere to be found, but a note tells Jonathan to eat up and await the Count’s return. The house seems to have peculiar shortcomings: there are no servants at all, although the extraordinary furniture and dining set shows that the Count is incredibly wealthy. There are also no mirrors anywhere in the house.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-face-does-dracula-have-in-dracula>What kind of face does Dracula have in Dracula?</h2>
<p>Jonathan observes him carefully: his face is aquiline, with a high bridge, thin nose, and arched nostrils, a high and round forehead, large eyebrows, scarlet lips, and unusually sharp teeth. His ears are pointed and he is unbelievably pale.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-dracula-force-mina-to-drink-his-blood>Why did Dracula force Mina to drink his blood?</h2>
<p>He then forced her to drink the blood from a wound he made in his chest. Now, the reasons for Renfield’s request for release are clear, as is the cause of his anxiety about consuming souls. He has provided the invitation Dracula needed to enter the asylum, and Mina has consequently been violated.</p>
