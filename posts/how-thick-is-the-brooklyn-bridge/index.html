<h2 id=how-thick-is-the-brooklyn-bridge>How thick is the Brooklyn Bridge?</h2>
<p>The Brooklyn Bridge, which spans New York’s East River to connect Manhattan and Brooklyn, was completed in 1883. Extending 1595 feet (486 meters), it was the longest suspension bridge in the world when it was finished. The bridge hangs from steel cables that are almost 16 inches (41 centimeters) thick.</p>

<p>Manhattan Bridge<br>
The Manhattan Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the East River in New York City, connecting Lower Manhattan at Canal Street with Downtown Brooklyn at the Flatbush Avenue Extension.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-brooklyn-bridge-famous-for>What is Brooklyn Bridge famous for?</h2>
<p>Upon its completion in 1883 it became the first roadway to connect Manhattan and Brooklyn, which were then separate cities (Brooklyn became part of New York City in 1898). Back then, with a central span of 1,595 feet, the Brooklyn Bridge was also the world’s longest suspension bridge.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-walk-across-the-brooklyn-bridge-at-night>Is it safe to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge at night?</h2>
<p>It is also very safe to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge at night, as there are many tourists and commuters using the bridge until about 11 pm (23:00) at night. In fact, walking the Brooklyn Bridge at night is one of the top free things to do at night in NYC.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-manhattan-bridge-parallel-to-the-brooklyn-bridge>Is the Manhattan Bridge parallel to the Brooklyn Bridge?</h2>
<p>The Manhattan Bridge (Across the East River) The Manhattan Bridge appears to run parallel to the Brooklyn Bridge, and indeed, from the Brooklyn side, the two bridges entrance ways are just a few blocks apart. However, the Manhattan Bridge arrives at a more northerly point in Manhattan than does the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-see-the-east-river-from-the-brooklyn-bridge>Can you see the East River from the Brooklyn Bridge?</h2>
<p>One doesn’t quite realize, at ground level in Brooklyn or Manhattan, just how vital the waterways are to New York City–or that Manhattan is really an island. From atop the Brooklyn Bridge, you can experience the island-ness of Manhattan, and the importance of the East River bridge crossings.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-cross-the-brooklyn-bridge>Who was the first person to cross the Brooklyn Bridge?</h2>
<p>The New York and Brooklyn Bridge was opened for use on May 24, 1883. Thousands of people attended the opening ceremony, and many ships were present in the East River for the occasion. Officially, Emily Warren Roebling was the first to cross the bridge.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-symbol-of-the-brooklyn-bridge>What is the symbol of the Brooklyn Bridge?</h2>
<p>The Brooklyn Bridge Symbol Analysis. An important symbol of New York that connects Brooklyn to Manhattan, the bridge is a liminal, or in-between space, not fully belonging to either Brooklyn or Manhattan. In this way, it comes to represent how many of the characters in the play are similarly on “bridges” of sorts in their lives,…</p>
