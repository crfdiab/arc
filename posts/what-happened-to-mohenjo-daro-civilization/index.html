<h2 id=what-happened-to-mohenjo-daro-civilization>What happened to Mohenjo Daro civilization?</h2>
<p>The civilization of the Indus River at Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa arose at about 2500 BCE and ended with apparent destruction about 1500 BCE. Apparently the Indus civillization was likely destroyed by the Indo-European migrants from Iran, the Aryans. The cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were built of fire-baked bricks.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-ancient-people-of-harappa-disappear>Why did the ancient people of Harappa disappear?</h2>
<p>The most common explanation is that the civilization disappeared because the region was invaded by nomadic people from outside the area. Specifically, it is believed that Aryan, cattle-raising nomads invaded the area.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-ancient-peoples-of-the-indus-valley-quizlet>What happened to the ancient peoples of the Indus Valley quizlet?</h2>
<p>What happened to the ancient peoples of the Indus Valley? They disappeared as though into thin air, and the cause remains unknown.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-largest-ancient-civilization>What is the largest ancient civilization?</h2>
<p>Harappan civilization<br>
Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia may be the best known of the first great urban cultures, but the largest was the Indus or Harappan civilization.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-indus-valley-civilization-known-for>What was the Indus Valley Civilization known for?</h2>
<p>The Indus cities are noted for their urban planning, a technical and political process concerned with the use of land and design of the urban environment. They are also noted for their baked brick houses, elaborate drainage systems, water supply systems, and clusters of large, nonresidential buildings.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-ancient-cities-ruins-were-found-in-the-1920s-along-the-indus-valley>What two ancient cities ruins were found in the 1920s along the Indus Valley?</h2>
<p>The civilization is among the most fascinating and mysterious cultures of the old world. Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, two great cities flourished along the valley of Indus River. The civilization was discovered after excavations at Harappa in west Punjab and Mohenjo-daro in Sindh in the 1920s.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-indus-valley-civilization-get-wiped-out>How did the Indus Valley Civilization get wiped out?</h2>
<p>There are several theories as of what happened to the inhabitants of Indus Valley civilization. But scholars are certain about one thing- it wasn’t invasion, disease or similar catastrophe that wiped out the entire civilization.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-peak-of-the-indus-valley-civilization>When was the peak of the Indus Valley Civilization?</h2>
<p>After its earliest stage around 7380 BC in Haryana, India and Mehrgarh, Pakistan, the Indus Valley Civilization reached a heyday around 2600 BC. At its height, the IVC stretched from Afghanistan to Bangladesh and traded with Sumer and Egypt.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-signs-of-war-in-the-indus-valley>Are there any signs of war in the Indus Valley?</h2>
<p>Archaeologists now think this is not true. There is no evidence of war or mass killings. Indus Valley people seem to have been peaceful. If they had an army, they have left few signs of weapons or battles. It’s more likely that the cities collapsed after natural disasters. Enemies might have moved in afterwards.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-indus-cities-start-to-fail>Why did the Indus cities start to fail?</h2>
<p>Around the time the Indus cities started to fail, Mesopotamia was going through huge political problems. Their trade networks collapsed and this would have had a big impact on the Indus cities. There would have been less work for traders and for manufacturers, who made the things which the traders sold abroad.</p>
