<h2 id=why-the-east-coast-is-warmer>Why the east coast is warmer?</h2>
<p>Land has a lower heat capacity than oceans, and it also heats and cools faster than oceans. During the winter, land is much colder than the oceans. When the westerly winds blow over it, the air cools substantially. Thus, the East Coast experiences extreme cold weather during the winter.</p>
<h2 id=why-east-coast-is-so-cold>Why East Coast is so cold?</h2>
<p>The cold temperature on the East Coast is due to the winds. In the winter, the westerly winds blow warm moist air onto the West Coast, which makes it rain so much. Since land cools and heats more than the ocean does, the land is much colder than the ocean during the winter.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-east-coast-colder-than-west-coast>Why is East Coast colder than West Coast?</h2>
<h2 id=is-london-colder-than-new-york>Is London colder than New York?</h2>
<p>New York City’s average lows during the winter months are mostly in the 20s and 30s Fahrenheit, whereas London’s winter lows hover around 40 degrees F. NYC’s summer highs are around 80 degrees F, and London’s are a good 10 degrees cooler, around 70 degrees F.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-mediterranean-climate-colder-than-the-west-coast>Why is the Mediterranean climate colder than the west coast?</h2>
<p>Annual temperature ranges are generally smaller than those found in marine west coast climates, since locations on the western sides of continents are not well positioned to receive the coldest polar air, which develops over land rather than over the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-warm-and-cool-currents-located-in-the-ocean>Where are the warm and cool currents located in the ocean?</h2>
<p>The western margin of each ocean basins, the general current curves poleward margins of the ocean basins, they curve back to the east here propelled by the west to east blowing westerly winds. The warm currents are flowing along the eastern coasts while cool currents are flowing along the western coasts.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-west-coast-warmer-than-the-east-coast>Why is the west coast warmer than the east coast?</h2>
<p>Ocean currents have a massive effect on Earth’s climate. They are the natural thermostats that keep the temperature of land in check. For instance, equatorial regions receive large quantities of sunlight. This means that these areas should get warmer and warmer as more sun falls on it, but this isn’t always the case.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-atlantic-ocean-in-the-western-or-eastern-hemisphere>Is the Atlantic Ocean in the western or Eastern Hemisphere?</h2>
<p>The Atlantic is roughly bounded to the west by North and South America, and to the east by Europe and Africa. Only a small part of the Atlantic Ocean, where the ocean meets the western coasts of Europe and Africa, is located in the Eastern Hemisphere.</p>
