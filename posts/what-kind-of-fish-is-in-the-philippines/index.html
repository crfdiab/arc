<p>Native Fish Of The Philippines</p>

<h2 id=what-are-the-traditional-fishing-in-the-philippines>What are the traditional fishing in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>There are three types of fisheries in the Philippines, namely: inland capture fisheries, aquaculture, and marine capture fisheries. Inland capture fisheries involve fishing in enclosed freshwater areas like lakes, reservoirs, rivers, estuaries, and natural brackish water (mixed seawater and freshwater) fishponds.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-big-fish-in-the-philippines>What is the big fish in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>One such species is the humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus). Also known as the Napoleon wrasse, it is one of the largest fish species that can be found on coral reefs. Now listed as endangered by the IUCN, they can grow up to 6 feet long.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-fishing-grounds-in-the-philippines>What are the major fishing grounds in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>The major fishing grounds in the Philippines are West Palawan waters, Sulu Sea, Visayan Sea, Moro Gulf and others. These fishing grounds constitute more than 64% of the total commercial fishing catch from 1992-1995.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-species-of-fish-are-there-in-the-philippines>How many species of fish are there in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>These waters contain more than 2,500 species of fish and over 500 species of coral, making the Philippines a marine biodiversity hotspot. Philippine sea life gives divers great opportunities to spot many amazing sea creatures.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fishing-do-people-do-in-the-philippines>What kind of fishing do people do in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Of these, an estimated 800,000 are small-scale fishermen using tradition, low-cost techniques, notably net fishing from small boats and the fish corral. The fish corral is a stationary pen that traps fish in coastal fishing grounds. Traditionally, these techniques have provided small-scale fishermen and their families with a means of subsistence.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-buy-filipino-fish-in-los-angeles>Where can I buy Filipino fish in Los Angeles?</h2>
<p>Interestingly, though the Philippine markets here in Los Angeles are just loaded with these fish, more than a dozen varieties, none of my Philippine cookbooks even mention their existence. The photo specimens, Salay-salay [Yellowtail Scad], were purchased from a Philippine market in Los Angeles.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-milk-fish-live-in-the-philippines>Where do milk fish live in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>The Milkfish species prefer to live in the tropical offshore marine waters and along continental shelves. A habitual range is usually 1 to 30 meters. They also frequent estuaries and rivers. Arius manillensis, commonly known as the Manila Sea Catfish, is an endemic marine fish found off of the coast of Luzon Island in the Philippines.</p>
