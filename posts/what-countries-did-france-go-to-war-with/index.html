<p>The French Revolutionary Wars (French: Guerres de la Révolution française) were a series of sweeping military conflicts lasting from 1792 until 1802 and resulting from the French Revolution. They pitted France against Great Britain, Austria, the Holy Roman Empire, Prussia, Russia, and several other monarchies.</p>

<p>Revolutionaries wanted war because they thought war would unify the country, and had a genuine desire to spread the ideas of the Revolution to all of Europe. On April 20, 1792, the Legislative Assembly (France’s governing body, formed in 1791) declared war on Austria.</p>

<p>From 1790 to 1794, the French Revolution became increasingly radical. After French King Louis XVI was tried and executed on January 21, 1793, war between France and monarchal nations Great Britain and Spain was inevitable.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-france-go-to-war-with-mexico>Why did France go to war with Mexico?</h2>
<p>In addition, French aspirations in Mexico had suffered a final defeat with the execution of the Austrian-born, French puppet Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico in 1867. The French imperial government now looked to a diplomatic success to stifle demands for a return to either a republic or a Bourbon monarchy.</p>

<p>1 The French and Indian War: A Summary. The Seven Years’ War (called the French and Indian War in the colonies) lasted from 1756 to 1763, forming a chapter in the 2 British Victory in Canada. 3 The Treaty of Paris Ends the War. 4 Impact of the Seven Years’ War on the American Revolution. …</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-french-declare-war-on-prussia>Why did the French declare war on Prussia?</h2>
<p>The French emperor, Napoleon III, declared war on Prussia on July 19, 1870, because his military advisers told him that the French army could defeat Prussia and that such a victory would restore his declining popularity in France. The French were convinced that the reorganization of their army in 1866 had made it superior to the German armies.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-britain-support-france-in-world-war-1>Why did Britain support France in World War 1?</h2>
<p>When Germany tried to oppose a French takeover of Morocco, Britain supported France. Relations between Austria-Hungary and neighbouring Serbia had been tense in the years before the murder of the Archduke. Austria had long seen Serbia as a threat to the stability of its multi-ethnic empire.</p>
