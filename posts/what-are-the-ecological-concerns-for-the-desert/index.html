<h2 id=what-are-the-ecological-concerns-for-the-desert>What are the ecological concerns for the desert?</h2>
<p>Global warming is increasing the incidence of drought, which dries up water holes. Higher temperatures may produce an increasing number of wildfires that alter desert landscapes by eliminating slow-growing trees and shrubs and replacing them with fast-growing grasses.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-deserts-important-economically>Why are deserts important economically?</h2>
<p>As well as biodiversity and their cultural significance, deserts are also useful economically due to their unique geological profiles or their environmental formation processes. The desert biome is one of the most important. There are 15 mineral deposit types on our planet and 13 of them are found in deserts.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-ecological-niche-in-the-desert>What is an ecological niche in the desert?</h2>
<p>Desert Niches Adaptations include a species’ selection of food, water and shelter as well as other facts of its behavior. Niches within desert ecosystems include open desert scrub, open grasslands, washes and sandy soils.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-benefit-of-desert>What is the benefit of desert?</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of deserts is that they are home to a diverse group of plants and animals. They are especially adapted for survival in the desert through their efficient use of water.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-desert-ecosystem-explain-it>What is desert ecosystem explain it?</h2>
<p>A desert ecosystem is defined by interactions between organisms, the climate in which they live, and any other non-living influences on the habitat. Deserts are arid regions that are generally associated with warm temperatures; however, cold deserts also exist.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-meant-by-ecological-niche>What is meant by ecological niche?</h2>
<p>Ecological niche is a term for the position of a species within an ecosystem, describing both the range of conditions necessary for persistence of the species, and its ecological role in the ecosystem. In most of ecological thinking, however, both meanings are implicitly or explicitly mixed.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-ecology-of-a-desert-determined>How is the ecology of a desert determined?</h2>
<p>Desert ecology. A desert ecosystem is defined by interactions between organism populations, the climate in which they live, and any other non-living influences on the habitat. Deserts are arid regions which are generally associated with warm temperatures, however cold deserts also exist. Deserts can be found on every continent,…</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-benefits-of-a-desert-ecosystem>What are the benefits of a desert ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Natural ecosystems provide numerous services and goods that support human well-being and survival ( Costanza et al., 1997, MA, 2005 ). Deserts provide many benefits that can meet the demands of both the local inhabitants and other surrounding communities.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-ecological-services-of-the-desert>What are the ecological services of the desert?</h2>
<p>The ecological service that most directly links growing human populations to arid-land ecosystems is water supply ( Havstad et al., 2007 ). Apart from the coastal strip, most of the northwestern desert is within the arid region. Water resources are scarce and variable.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-plants-and-animals-in-the-desert-related>How are plants and animals in the desert related?</h2>
<p>Desert inhabiting organisms share most genetic and physiological traits with closely related species living in mesic environments. Many species of desert plants and animals are living close to their limits of tolerance for one or more environmental variables. For most organisms, tissue temperatures greater than 42°C are lethal.</p>
