<h2 id=which-state-has-jurisdiction-in-a-divorce>Which state has jurisdiction in a divorce?</h2>
<p>A: The home state of the child has custody jurisdiction, unless one state asserts continuing jurisdiction. The state that rendered the original custody decree can assert jurisdiction in any modification proceeding as long as one of the parties remains a resident and that state has jurisdiction under its own laws.</p>
<h2 id=is-arkansas-a-no-fault-state-when-it-comes-to-divorce>Is Arkansas a no fault state when it comes to divorce?</h2>
<p>Arkansas is a fault state for divorce. This means you will have to show that your spouse did something to you in order to get a divorce. The only way to get a divorce from your spouse without showing fault is to live separate and apart from your spouse for at least 18 continuous months.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-arkansas-law-on-divorce>What is Arkansas law on divorce?</h2>
<p>To file for divorce in Arkansas, you or your spouse must have been a resident of Arkansas for at least 60 days before filing for the divorce and 3 full months before the final judgment granting the divorce. 1. No divorce will be granted until at least 30 days have passed from filing for the divorce.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-acceptable-grounds-for-fault-based-divorce-in-arkansas>What are the acceptable grounds for fault based divorce in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>The acceptable grounds for fault-based divorce in Arkansas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>impotency.</li>
<li>conviction of a felony.</li>
<li>habitual drunkenness for at least one year after the marriage began.</li>
<li>cruel and barbarous treatment toward a spouse.</li>
<li>either spouse committed adultery, and.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=which-court-has-jurisdiction-in-divorce>Which court has jurisdiction in divorce?</h2>
<p>A spouse who wishes to have their marriage dissolved must approach the High Court or the Regional Court of the Magistrate Court and have a summons issued. A court has a jurisdiction to hear a divorce matter: If the parties are domiciled (live) in the area of the jurisdiction of the court as at the date of divorce.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-adultery-affect-divorce-in-arkansas>How does adultery affect divorce in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>In a fault-based divorce, a spouse claims that the other engaged in marital misconduct which caused the divorce. If your spouse has been unfaithful and you’re seeking a divorce in Arkansas, adultery is one of the grounds upon which you can base a request to legally end your marriage.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-pay-alimony-if-spouse-cheats>Do you have to pay alimony if spouse cheats?</h2>
<p>In California, an adulterous spouse isn’t forced to pay alimony due to infidelity. Punitive damages are not awarded on this basis. If a judge decides that the lesser-earning spouse’s new living arrangements effectively ease his or her financial burden, the judge may lessen the amount of alimony.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-wife-entitled-to-in-a-divorce-in-arkansas>What is a wife entitled to in a divorce in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>Yes. In Arkansas, alimony is called spousal maintenance and it’s decided on a case-by-case basis. A judge won’t award alimony in every divorce case. Spousal maintenance is generally awarded when one spouse has a financial need and the other spouse has the ability to pay spousal maintenance.</p>
<h2 id=is-arkansas-a-5050-divorce-state>Is Arkansas A 50/50 divorce state?</h2>
<p>Arkansas is an “equitable distribution” state when it comes to property division in the dissolution of a marriage. Arkansas law presumes that a couple’s marital property will be split between them 50-50, but several factors may lead a judge to change to unequal distribution.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-you-have-to-be-married-to-get-alimony-in-arkansas>How long do you have to be married to get alimony in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>The duration of payments is determined by a judge in Arkansas family court. Alimony length is usually based on length of marriage – one commonly used standard for alimony duration is that 1 year of alimony is paid every three years of marriage (however, this is not always the case in every state or with every judge).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-quickie-mexican-divorce>What is a quickie Mexican divorce?</h2>
<p>A divorce in Mexico was easier, quicker, and less expensive than a divorce in most U.S. states, which then only allowed at-fault divorces requiring extensive proof and lengthy court review. It was often referred to as a quickie (sometimes spelled quicky) Mexican divorce.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-laws-for-marital-property-division-in-arkansas>Are there laws for marital property division in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>In Arkansas, there are no laws requiring courts to consider economic misconduct (aka wasting marital assets) by either spouse when determing property division. In many other states, economic misconduct can result in a higher percentage of marital property awarded to the injured spouse.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-child-custody-order-be-changed-in-arkansas>Can a child custody order be changed in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>Arkansas courts allow physical and legal custody (or both) of children, based on a number of determining factors and are often bound by custody relocation laws. A custody order may be changed (“modification of child custody”) if it would be in the child’s best interests or for a “material change in circumstances,” such…</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-grounds-for-divorce-in-arkansas>What are the grounds for divorce in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>Lack of support—when the spouse has a legal obligation to support you and the ability but does not. The most commonly used ground for divorce in Arkansas is general indignities. This means that your spouse has made your life so intolerable that you can no longer stand to be married to him or her.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-have-both-physical-and-legal-custody-in-arkansas>Is it legal to have both physical and legal custody in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>Arkansas courts allow physical and legal custody (or both) of children, based on a number of determining factors and are often bound by custody relocation laws.</p>
