<p>South Coast Plaza<br>
Located in Costa Mesa, South Coast Plaza is known as the largest shopping mall in California. It is home to 250 retailers and is an upscale luxury mall which says a lot when you stop to realize, that before the site was South Coast Plaza, it was a lima bean field.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-these-shopping-malls-is-the-largest>Which of these shopping malls is the largest?</h2>
<p>Dubai Mall<br>
Dubai Mall – Dubai, United Arab Emirates At over 12 million square feet (equivalent to more than 50 soccer fields), the Dubai Mall is the largest shopping mall in the world based on total area.</p>
<h2 id=is-westfield-bigger-than-bluewater>Is Westfield bigger than Bluewater?</h2>
<p>The extension will give Bluewater more than 185,000 sq/m of retail space, making it only second biggest in the UK to the intu Metrocentre in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear.

<h2 id=are-there-any-malls-in-downtown-los-angeles>Are there any malls in downtown Los Angeles?</h2>
<p>Downtown has changed in recent years, but it is mostly a commercial area. There is almost no shopping in downtown LA, except for the wholesale areas- there’s certainly no mall. Each neighborhood has a mall. There’s The Beverly Center, The Promenade and SM Place, the Hollywood & HIghland, the Grove, and more. There are large outlets just outside LA.</p>

<p>Cinemark Theatres, Books-A-Million, The Children’s Place, TJ Maxx, Burlington Coat Factory, Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse, Best Buy, Old Navy, Bass Pro Shops, Saks Fifth Avenue, Ulta Beauty, Dave & Busters, Yard House . ^ “Largest Shopping Malls in the United States”.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-best-place-to-shop-in-hollywood>Where is the best place to shop in Hollywood?</h2>
<p>There is never a dull moment on Hollywood Boulevard and the same goes for the shopping at Hollywood & Highland. Boasting iconic tourist attractions such as the TCL Chinese Theatre, the Dolby Theatre and the Walk of Fame, this mall offers just as much gravy in its range of shops.</p>
