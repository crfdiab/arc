<p>Sea Traders Because they didn’t have much room for growing crops, the ancient Phoenicians turned to the Mediterranean Sea and became traders instead of farmers. They created glassware from the sand along the coast to trade for things they needed.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-phoenicians-navigate-the-waters-of-the-mediterranean>How did Phoenicians navigate the waters of the Mediterranean?</h2>
<p>Navigation. The Phoenicians did not have the compass or any other navigational instrument, and so they relied on natural features on coastlines, the stars, and dead-reckoning to guide their way and reach their destination.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-phoenicians-become-dominant-in-the-mediterranean>When did the Phoenicians become dominant in the Mediterranean?</h2>
<p>The Phoenician people had been dominant sea traders in the Mediterranean prior to 1500 BC [xvii],[xviii] and in some cases had partnered with others to maintain that position. Then the rise of the Mycenaeans [xix] caused sea trade in the Aegean—and even as far as Cyprus—to fall into the hands of that new power.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-people-are-the-phoenicians>What kind of people are the Phoenicians?</h2>
<p>Definition. Phoenicia was an ancient civilization composed of independent city -states located along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea stretching through what is now Syria, Lebanon and northern Israel. The Phoenicians were a great maritime people, known for their mighty ships adorned with horses’ heads in honor of their god of the sea, Yamm.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-phoenicians-use-the-fertile-crescent-for>What did the Phoenicians use the Fertile Crescent for?</h2>
<p>Other antiquities famed to the Phoenicians include carved ivories to be used in furniture, metalwork, and especially glassware. The Fertile Crescent is roughly an arc-shaped area which stretches from the mouth of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers at the Persian Gulf, west to the Red Sea.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-most-northern-city-of-the-phoenicians>Where was the most northern city of the Phoenicians?</h2>
<p>The most northern Phoenician city was on the island of Arwad, also known as Arvad and Arados. It had been taken from the Phoenicians prior to the coming of the Sea Peoples and was being held by the Hittites.</p>
