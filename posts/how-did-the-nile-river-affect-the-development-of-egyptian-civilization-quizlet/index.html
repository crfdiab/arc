<h2 id=what-role-did-the-nile-river-play-in-the-development-of-egyptian>What role did the Nile River play in the development of Egyptian?</h2>
<p>The most important thing the Nile provided to the Ancient Egyptians was fertile land. Most of Egypt is desert, but along the Nile River the soil is rich and good for growing crops. They also sold a lot of their wheat throughout the Middle East helping the Egyptians to become rich.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-nile-crucial-to-the-development-of-egyptian-civilization>Why was the Nile crucial to the development of Egyptian civilization?</h2>
<p>The Nile was a source of water for Egyptians which was important because of the desert area that surrounded the civilization; without water from the Nile, the Egyptians would not have been able to settle in this area. The Nile River also allowed Egyptians to irrigate the land to grow crops.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-nile-river-so-important-to-egypt>Why was the Nile River so important to Egypt?</h2>
<p>The Nile played an important role in the life of the ancient Egyptians. It makes life in the deserts of Egypt possible. It provided drinking water, a source of irrigation for crops, and most importantly the fertile soil used to grow crops. Without the Nile River it would have been difficult for Egyptian civilizations to survive.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-nile-river-help-the-people-of-egypt>How does the Nile River help the people of Egypt?</h2>
<p>The ancient Egyptians relied heavily on the Nile River for agriculture and trade . The Nile River helped the ancient Egyptians to thrive. Each year, the Nile River flooded. This flooding saturated the usually dry soil. Silt deposits developed and the river waters helped to create fertile soil.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-river-nile-associated-to-egypt>Why is the river Nile associated to Egypt?</h2>
<p>Well, the River enabled Egypt to grow in all aspects. This fact can be supported by the fact that the Nile River was the only source of water and food for the Egyptians. This is because the Nile River was a source of fresh water for the Egyptians. It is important to note that the Egyptians cultivated wheat, flax and other crops.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-nile-river-contributed-to-egyptian-society>How did the Nile River contributed to Egyptian society?</h2>
<p>The ancient Egyptian civilisation flourished in Africa on the river bank of Nile. The bank of Nile was overflowed due to flood in that river which created fertility of the soil. The fertility of soil helped in ample production of crops which sustained the life of the people of that land and contributed to the growth of socio-politico-economic and cultural life of the Egyptians.</p>
