<h2 id=when-did-rand-paul-get-elected-to-the-senate>When did Rand Paul get elected to the Senate?</h2>
<p>United States Senate election (2016)</p>
<h2 id=does-rand-paul-represent-citizens-of-kentucky>Does Rand Paul represent citizens of Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Rand Paul is a member of the Republican Party, a U.S. Senator representing the state of Kentucky, and a former candidate for President of the United States. According to Paul, he identifies as both a “constitutional conservative” and a “libertarian conservative.”</p>
<h2 id=how-much-did-charles-booker-lose-by>How much did Charles Booker lose by?</h2>
<p>His surge came after his participation in protests over the death of Breonna Taylor. However, Booker ultimately lost to Amy McGrath, receiving 42.7% of the vote compared to McGrath’s 45.4%.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-doctor-is-ron-paul>What kind of doctor is Ron Paul?</h2>
<p>Paul earned a Doctor of Medicine degree from Duke University’s School of Medicine in 1961, and completed his medical internship at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and his residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-senators-for-kentucky>Who are the senators for Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Rand Paul (Republican Party)<br>
Mitch McConnell (Republican Party)<br>
Kentucky/Senators<br>
Kentucky is currently represented in the U.S. Senate by Republicans Mitch McConnell (serving since 1985) and Rand Paul (serving since 2011).</p>
<h2 id=where-is-charles-booker-from>Where is Charles Booker from?</h2>
<p>Louisville, Kentucky, United States<br>
Charles Booker/Place of birth</p>
<h2 id=what-district-does-massie-represent>What district does Massie represent?</h2>
<p>Representative (R-KY 4th District) since 2012<br>
Thomas Massie/Office</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-senator-of-kentucky>Who is the senator of Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Kentucky/Senators</p>
<h2 id=who-is-winning-the-senate-race-in-kentucky>Who is winning the Senate race in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>Senator Rand Paul won the U.S. Senate race in Kentucky on Tuesday. Paul is up by 15 points with all precincts reporting. Below are detailed results for the race. View other Kentucky election results on our full Kentucky results page. See all races on our Senate map.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-most-unpopular-politicians-in-kentucky>Who are the most unpopular politicians in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>And this wasn’t just a single poll — surveys through 2018 and earlier in 2019 conducted by Morning Consult also found both men very unpopular in Kentucky. Consider that it’s not like all Americans hate the politicians who represent them.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-conservatives-and-populists-in-kentucky>Who are the Conservatives and Populists in Kentucky?</h2>
<p>In that bloc of four states, including Kentucky, conservative and populist voters (each about 30 percent of the electorate) are about equally-split, while there are significantly more conservatives than populists in other regions.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-bevin-and-paul-lose-their-primaries>Why did Bevin and Paul lose their primaries?</h2>
<p>Bevin and Paul, in their initial runs for governor and senator respectively, beat more populist rivals in GOP primaries. Early this year, Adkins lost the Democratic primary for governor to Beshear because of his poor showings in urban areas, where his anti-abortion stance probably didn’t help.</p>
