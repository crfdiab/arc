<h2 id=can-my-minor-child-travel-internationally-without-parents>Can my minor child travel internationally without parents?</h2>
<p>Children traveling outside the U.S. Children under 18 may need a Letter of Consent to travel internationally without both parents.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-permission-to-take-a-minor-out-of-the-country>Do you need permission to take a minor out of the country?</h2>
<p>You must get the permission of everyone with parental responsibility for a child or from a court before taking the child abroad. Taking a child abroad without permission is child abduction.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-travel-internationally-without-a-parent>How old do you have to be to travel internationally without a parent?</h2>
<p>Children younger than 5 need to travel with a parent, legal guardian or someone who is at least 18 years of age or older. If the youngest traveler is 5-14 and the oldest traveler is 15-17, the younger traveler is still considered an unaccompanied minor.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-take-my-child-out-of-country-for-vacation-without-fathers-permission>Can I take my child out of country for vacation without father’s permission?</h2>
<p>The only way you can take your child out of the country without their father’s consent is if you have sole custody, and you can prove that by providing papers, or you can prove that you have no idea where the father is and the court states that you can travel with them.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-needed-to-travel-internationally-with-a-minor>What is needed to travel internationally with a minor?</h2>
<p>All children, including infants, must have their own passport or Trusted Traveler Program document for U.S. entry. Carry documents for traveling with minor children. If you are escorting a minor child without the parents, have a letter from both parents indicating that you have permission to travel with the minor.</p>
<h2 id=do-minors-need-a-letter-to-fly-alone>Do minors need a letter to fly alone?</h2>
<p>A Child Travel Consent form (sometimes called a letter of permission to travel) provides proof that a child has permission to travel without both (or either) legal guardians present. If a child is crossing borders alone or with an adult who isn’t their legal guardian, they need a consent letter signed by both parents.</p>
<h2 id=can-my-wife-take-my-child-abroad-without-my-consent>Can my wife take my child abroad without my consent?</h2>
<p>If both parents have parental responsibility, and there are no child arrangements orders or any restrictions in place, then neither of you can take the child abroad without the written consent of the other person with parental responsibility. This is the same for a mother, who alone has parental responsibility.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-16-year-old-travel-internationally-with-one-parent>Can a 16 year old travel internationally with one parent?</h2>
<p>Can the 16-year-old travel abroad without the father’s permission? If the mother has sole legal custody, then the father’s permission in not necessary. If the parents have shared custody, then consent may be necessary. Notarized parental consent is required from the non-applying parent for minors age 15 and younger.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-go-abroad-at-17-without-parents>Can you go abroad at 17 without parents?</h2>
<p>If you are 18 or over – You will be able to travel abroad on your own without the consent of your parents. If you are under the age of 18 – It is up to the airline or travel operator whether you can travel abroad.</p>
<h2 id=does-my-ex-need-my-permission-to-take-my-child-abroad>Does my ex need my permission to take my child abroad?</h2>
<p>If one parent alone has parental responsibility, and there is no court order, the permission of the other parent is not strictly necessary. A father without parental responsibility can ask the court to grant him parental responsibility and could then object to the child being taken abroad.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-child-travel-with-just-one-parent>Can a child travel with just one parent?</h2>
<p>Parental consent forms aren’t required for all international destinations or for travel within the U.S., but the U.S. Department of State recommends that a child carries one if he is not traveling with his parents or if he is traveling with only one parent. There is no official consent form, so you must type your own.</p>
