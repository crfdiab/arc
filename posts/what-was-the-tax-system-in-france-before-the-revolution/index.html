<h2 id=what-was-the-tax-system-in-france-before-the-revolution>What was the tax system in France before the Revolution?</h2>
<p>Taille, the most important direct tax of the pre-Revolutionary monarchy in France. Its unequal distribution, with clergy and nobles exempt, made it one of the hated institutions of the ancien régime. The taille originated in the early Middle Ages as an arbitrary exaction from peasants.</p>
<h2 id=how-the-taxation-policy-during-old-regime-was-responsible-for-revolution-in-france>How the taxation policy during old regime was responsible for revolution in France?</h2>
<p>One of the many reasons why the revolution broke out was because only the members of the third estate paid taxes to the state. The members of the first and second estates were exempted from paying any taxes to the king. The burden of financing activities of the state through taxes was borne by the third estate alone.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-three-direct-taxes-of-france>What were the three direct taxes of France?</h2>
<p>In France there are three categories of taxes on income: the corporate tax, the income tax for individuals and taxes for social purposes (CSG and the CRDS, paid by the households).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-three-events-that-happened-during-the-french-revolution>What are three events that happened during the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>Here are 10 major events of the French Revolution and their dates.</p>
<ul>
<li>#1 The Tennis Court Oath – June 20, 1789.</li>
<li>#2 Storming of the Bastille – July 14, 1789.</li>
<li>#3 Abolition of Feudalism – August 4, 1789.</li>
<li>#4 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen – August 26, 1789.</li>
<li>#5 Women’s March on Versailles – October 5, 1789.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=who-was-the-taxation-policy-responsible-for-french-revolution>Who was the taxation policy responsible for French Revolution?</h2>
<p>the third estate<br>
The cost of funding state activities by taxation was solely borne by the third estate. So these are the taxation policies responsible for the French Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-causes-that-led-to-the-french-revolution-quizlet>What were the causes that led to the French Revolution quizlet?</h2>
<p>What were the main causes of the French Revolution? Enlightenment ideas, Economic Troubles, Weak Leader, Meeting of the Estates General, National Assembly, and Tennis Court Oath.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-taxation-an-important-cause-of-the-french-revolution>Why was taxation an important cause of the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>Taxation is considered an important cause of the French Revolution. The accepted view is during the 1700s, France’s taxation regime became excessive, inefficient and unfair. 2. The French were subject to a range of direct taxes (payable to the royal government) and indirect taxes (payable on items like salt,…</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-taxes-did-france-pay-in-the-1700s>What kind of taxes did France pay in the 1700s?</h2>
<p>The accepted view is during the 1700s, France’s taxation regime became excessive, inefficient and unfair. 2. The French were subject to a range of direct taxes (payable to the royal government) and indirect taxes (payable on items like salt, wine and tobacco) as well as feudal payments.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-french-aristocracy-refuse-to-pay-taxes>Why did the French aristocracy refuse to pay taxes?</h2>
<p>They bound the French peasantry into compromising feudal obligations and refused to contribute any tax revenue to the French government. This blatantly unfair taxation arrangement did little to endear the aristocracy to the common people.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-french-revolution-raise-new-money>How did the French Revolution raise new money?</h2>
<p>As for raising new money, the only system in place was taxation . At the time, however, taxation only applied to peasants. The nobility were tax-exempt, and the parlements would never agree to across-the-board tax increases.</p>
