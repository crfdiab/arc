<h2 id=what-kingdom-conquered-egypt>What kingdom conquered Egypt?</h2>
<p>In 332 BC, Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great conquered Egypt as he toppled the Achaemenids and established the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom, whose first ruler was one of Alexander’s former generals, Ptolemy I Soter.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-kingdoms-was-egypt-divided-into>What two kingdoms was Egypt divided into?</h2>
<p>Egypt was originally divided into two kingdoms. The two kingdoms were called lower and upper Egypt. The two kingdoms were enemies and almost created a civil war. The Pharaoh Menes united both kingdoms creating peace and avoiding a civil war.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-kingdoms-did-king-narmer-unite>What two kingdoms did King Narmer unite?</h2>
<p>In this way Menes united the two kingdoms. Unification means the joining together of two separate parts, in the case, the two kingdoms. Menes, sometimes known as Narmer, became the first pharaoh. He set up his new capital of the united Egypt in the city of Memphis in Lower Egypt….</p>

<h2 id=why-did-egypts-old-kingdom-fall-apart>Why did Egypt’s Old Kingdom fall apart?</h2>
<p>There were several factors that contributed to the decline of the Old Kingdom, but the most important issue was the erosion of the authority of the Pharaoh and the accompanying growing power of the nobility and priesthood. This led to the decentralization of power in Egypt and constant power struggles and civil war.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-kingdom-of-egypt-become-independent>When did the Kingdom of Egypt become independent?</h2>
<p>Kingdom of Egypt. The Kingdom of Egypt ( Arabic: المملكة المصرية ‎ Al-Mamlaka l-Maṣreyya, “the Egyptian Kingdom”) was the de jure independent Egyptian state established under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty in 1922 following the Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence by the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-kingdom-of-egypt-overthrown-in-1952>Why was the Kingdom of Egypt overthrown in 1952?</h2>
<p>The kingdom was plagued by corruption, and its citizens saw it as a puppet of the British. This, coupled with the defeat in the 1948–1949 Palestine War, led to the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 by the Free Officers Movement. Farouk abdicated in favour of his infant son Fuad II.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-kingdom-of-sudan-united-with-egypt>Why was the Kingdom of Sudan United with Egypt?</h2>
<p>Throughout the kingdom’s existence, the Sudan was formally united with Egypt. However, actual Egyptian authority in the Sudan was largely nominal due to Britain’s role as the dominant power in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan .</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-prime-minister-of-the-kingdom-of-egypt>Who was the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Egypt?</h2>
<p>Demonstrations again led to violence. In deference to the growing nationalism and at the suggestion of the High Commissioner, Lord Allenby, the UK recognized Egyptian independence in 1922, abolishing the protectorate, and converting the Sultanate of Egypt into the Kingdom of Egypt. Sarwat Pasha became prime minister.</p>
