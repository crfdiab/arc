<h2 id=what-changes-have-been-made-to-the-australian-flag>What changes have been made to the Australian flag?</h2>
<p>Robert Vose 2004 – The Seven Golden Stars flag rearranges the elements of the current flag, changes the colours to green and gold and adds the yellow sun from the Aboriginal flag. A variant adds the full Australian Coat of Arms to the lower fly and another replaces the Commonwealth Star with the arms.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-australian-flag-change>When did the Australian flag change?</h2>
<p>Australia: People’s Flag – The 1901 flag competition winning design was announced on 3 September 1901 and the selected design was subsequently modified and formally adopted from 20 February 1903, with a further change to the current design from 23 February 1908.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-australian-flag-changed-from-red-to-blue>Why was the Australian flag changed from red to blue?</h2>
<p>When the Commonwealth Government announced a competition to design a flag for Australia in 1901, entrants were asked to send a design for two flags – one for official and naval purposes and the other for merchant ships. This resulted in a Blue Ensign and a Red Ensign.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-australian-flag-should-be-changed>Why the Australian flag should be changed?</h2>
<p>The colours of our flag are out of line with our national colours, therefore we should change our flag to bring it in line. For many years green and gold had been used as our “national sporting colours”.</p>
<h2 id=is-australia-going-to-change-its-flag>Is Australia going to change its flag?</h2>
<p>A dark blue, forward moving, kangaroo silhouetted against a golden sky has replaced the Union Jack and Federation Star featured on the current Australian Flag. The white stars of the Southern Cross are reversed out of a blue field, which is unchanged from the current flag.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-original-flag-of-australia>What was the original flag of Australia?</h2>
<p>Eureka Flag<br>
The Eureka Flag is often viewed as the first “Australian” flag as it was the first notable example of a design that had the Southern Cross while excluding the Union Flag.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-australian-flag-become-the-national-flag>When did the Australian flag become the national flag?</h2>
<p>What is now the Australian national flag was created soon after Federation in a competition in which nearly 33,000 people took part. However, for the next 50 years Australia’s official flag was the British flag, the Union Jack. This changed in 1954 when the Flags Act came into effect.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-australian-flag-changed-to-the-torres-strait-islander-flag>When was the Australian flag changed to the Torres Strait Islander flag?</h2>
<p>An amendment to the Flags Act 1953 was passed in 1998 to ensure that the Australian National Flag can be changed only with the agreement of the Australian people. Other official Australian flags include the Australian Aboriginal Flag, the Torres Strait Islander Flag and the ensigns of the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-union-jack-added-to-the-australian-flag>When was the Union Jack added to the Australian flag?</h2>
<p>Australian Flag 1903 – Stars Altered in Southern Cross The King approved slightly altered designs in 1903, and the Union Jack was to remain the senior flag to both designs. Australian Flag 1909 – Seventh Point Added to Federation Star Then, in 1909 a seventh point was added to the Federation star.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-winning-design-for-the-australian-flag>What was the winning design for the Australian flag?</h2>
<p>The judging and approval process were such that only a British Ensign with a badge representative of Australia was likely to be a winner. The winning design for the merchant flag was based on the British Red Ensign, and the winning design for the official Government flag was based on the British Blue Ensign.</p>
