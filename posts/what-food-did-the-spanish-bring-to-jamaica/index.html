<h2 id=what-food-did-the-spanish-bring-to-jamaica>What food did the Spanish bring to Jamaica?</h2>
<p>The Spanish introduced many crops to Jamaica like: sugar cane, bananas and citrus fruits. Also it was they who apparently introduced most of the pets that are currently on the island, such as pigs, horses, goats, cats, dogs and chickens.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spaniards-influence-the-jamaican-culture>How did the Spaniards influence the Jamaican culture?</h2>
<p>The Spaniards originally brought slavery to Jamaica. Then they were overthrown by the English. These contributions resulted in a diversity that affected the language, music, dance, religion, and social norms and practices of the Jamaicans.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-spaniards-arrived-in-jamaica>When did the Spaniards arrived in Jamaica?</h2>
<p>May 5, 1494<br>
On May 5, 1494 Christopher Columbus, the European explorer, who sailed west to get to the East Indies and came upon the region now called the West Indies, landed in Jamaica. This occurred on his second voyage to the West Indies.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-spanish-bring-to-the-island-of-jamaica>What did the Spanish bring to the island of Jamaica?</h2>
<p>Many of Jamaica’s most common plants were brought here by the Spanish. Most of the crops brought by the Spanish were originally from the Mediterranean. From tangy citrus fruit to tasty starches, we really do owe the Spanish a big thank you for bringing these crops to our island.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-jamaican-architecture-adapted-to-the-tropics>Why was Jamaican architecture adapted to the tropics?</h2>
<p>But this perishable style of building went out of fashion during Jamaica’s colonization by the UK; Jamaican planters wanted to showcase cultural loyalty to England, and therefore British contemporary architecture was adapted to the tropics.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-architecture-do-they-have-in-jamaica>What kind of architecture do they have in Jamaica?</h2>
<p>Jamaica ’s history can be found all throughout the streets of Kingston, whose buildings reflect the impact of colonization and modernization of the Caribbean. From colonial plantation houses to vernacular structures and contemporary architecture, Culture Trip takes a closer look at Jamaica’s architecture.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-jamaica-build-so-many-tall-buildings>Why did Jamaica build so many tall buildings?</h2>
<p>But as the climatic conditions in Jamaica were not the same as in Europe, the incoming styles had to be adapted for tropical weather. As the 20th century matured, modern building techniques and materials entered the country. The construction of various tall buildings naturally followed, as did the construction of commercial complexes.</p>
