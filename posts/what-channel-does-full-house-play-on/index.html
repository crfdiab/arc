<h2 id=did-michelle-from-full-house-die>Did Michelle from Full House die?</h2>
<p>There’s a fan theory that Michelle Tanner passed away after horseback riding in the series finale. In the last episode of the original show, we saw that she got her memory back. The was the end of Full House as we knew it. She could have developed complications after the show ended and it didn’t end well for her.”</p>
<h2 id=why-did-full-house-get-taken-off-netflix>Why did full house get taken off Netflix?</h2>
<p>The answer to this one is pretty simple – it’s all down to the licensing rights for the series having expired. Netflix had been showing the original series, which ran from 1987-1995, since 2016 when the belated sequel Fuller House made its debut.</p>

<p>The two stations share studios on Woodway Drive in Woodway, Texas (using a Waco address); KYLE-TV operates a secondary studio on Broadmoor Drive in Bryan and transmitter facilities near Farm to Market Road 2818 on the city’s western outskirts.

<h2 id=is-there-a-channel-28-for-kyle-tv>Is there a channel 28 for KYLE TV?</h2>
<p>Before KYLE’s launch, channel 28 had been used for a translator station in College Station, K28AK, that carried KWKT’s programming; in most of the market, KWKT was only viewable on cable. Following the purchase, KYLE became a satellite of KWKT, while WB programming moved to a secondary clearance on UPN affiliate KAKW (channel 62).</p>

<p>KYLE-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 28, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station’s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 29 to channel 28 for post-transition operations.</p>
