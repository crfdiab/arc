<h2 id=why-did-noble-willingham-leave-walker-texas-ranger>Why did Noble Willingham leave Walker, Texas Ranger?</h2>
<p>û Noble Willingham, who left his role as a saloon owner on the television series “Walker, Texas Ranger” to make a run for political office in Texas, has died. Willingham died Saturday at his Palm Springs home, his manager, Sandy Josephs, said Tuesday.</p>
<h2 id=did-trivette-get-killed-on-walker-texas-ranger>Did trivette get killed on Walker, Texas Ranger?</h2>
<p>She came back into his life in a sort of cat-and-mouse chase as Trivette struggled with his policeman’s duty and his personal feelings for her. In the end, she eventually died in his arms by the episode’s conclusion.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-walkers-wife-die>How did Walker’s wife die?</h2>
<p>He was also briefly involved with a handicapped young woman named Robin. “Days Past” reveals that Walker was about to get married ten years prior, but his girlfriend Ellen Garrett, was killed in an ambush set up by criminal Vince Pike.</p>
<h2 id=did-cd-parker-die-in-real-life>Did CD Parker die in real life?</h2>
<p>He died of natural causes, according to the Riverside County coroner’s office. He played barkeep C.D. Parker on “Walker, Texas Ranger” from 1993-99.</p>
<h2 id=did-geri-kill-emily-on-walker>Did Geri kill Emily on Walker?</h2>
<p>While Walker and his fellow Rangers bust the syndicate on completely different charges after their leader Oswald finds the hidden wire on Geri, a woman in the busted meeting named Cali eludes the authorities and reveals that she was actually the one that murdered Emily on that fateful day just over a year ago.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-cordell-walker-leave-the-texas-ranger>Why did Cordell Walker leave the Texas Ranger?</h2>
<p>That’s not a bad thing, per se, but it is throwing off fans of the original series for good reason. The new series follows Cordell Walker, who has returned to his role as Texas Ranger after nearly a year away working an undercover case. Walker sets up a lot of family and work drama in the wake of his wife Emily’s death.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-actor-in-walker-texas-ranger>Who is the actor in Walker Texas Ranger?</h2>
<p>Clarence Gilyard Jr. was born on December 24, 1955 in Moses Lake, Washington, USA as Clarence Darnell Gilyard Jr. He is an actor and director, known for Die Hard (1988), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993) and Top Gun (1986).</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-trent-malloy-in-walker-texas-ranger>What happens to Trent Malloy in Walker Texas Ranger?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the series was cancelled after one season. Wlcek would leave Walker, Texas Ranger shortly thereafter. Wlcek hasn’t played a recurring character on a TV show since he stopped playing Trent Malloy, with most of Wlcek’s work coming in small TV movies, such as 2009’s Hydra and 2011’s Love’s Christmas Journey.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-texas-ranger-in-die-hard>Who was the Texas Ranger in Die Hard?</h2>
<p>Having previously portrayed Marcus Williams (AKA Sundown) in Top Gun, and Theo, a gangster, in Die Hard, Clarence Gilyard was a natural choice to play Texas Ranger James “Jimmy” Trivette. A close friend and the right-hand man of Chuck Norris’ Walker, Trivette offers a foil to Walker’s take-names, kick-*ss method of crime fighting.</p>
