<p>Old Ironsides<br>
USS Constitution is the oldest commissioned warship in the world still afloat. Nicknamed “Old Ironsides,” she is today berthed in Boston and is known as “America’s Ship of State.” Her story illuminates much about the U.S. Navy during the nation’s first 100 years.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-uss-constitution-get-its-nickname>When did USS Constitution get its nickname?</h2>
<p>August 19, 1812<br>
On August 19, 1812, the crew of the USS Constitution caught sight of the British HMS Guerriere at sea off Nova Scotia and the American vessel would soon win its nickname, Old Ironsides. Captain Isaac Hull of the Constitution and Captain James Dacres of the Guerriere were eager for a fight.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-nickname-of-the-uss-constitution-an-american-ship-which-defeated-five-british-warships>What was the nickname of the USS Constitution an American ship which defeated five British warships?</h2>
<p>During the War of 1812, the U.S. Navy frigate Constitution defeats the British frigate Guerrière in a furious engagement off the coast of Nova Scotia.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-old-ironsides-and-how-did-it-acquire-its-nickname>What was Old Ironsides and how did it acquire its nickname?</h2>
<p>How did the Constitution get the nickname “Old Ironsides”? It was in the great naval battle where the Constitution captured the British ship Guerriere. A sailor on the Guerriere saw 18-pound British cannonballs bouncing right off the hull of the Constitution. He exclaimed, “Huzza, her sides are made of iron!”</p>
<h2 id=what-does-uss-stand-for>What does USS stand for?</h2>
<p>United States Ship<br>
United States Ship/Full name<br>
The prefix “USS,” meaning “United States Ship,” is used in official documents to identify a commissioned ship of the Navy. It applies to a ship while she is in commission. Before commissioning, or after decommissioning, she is referred to by name, with no prefix.</p>
<h2 id=who-named-the-uss-constitution>Who named the USS Constitution?</h2>
<p>President George Washington<br>
She was launched in 1797, one of six original frigates authorized for construction by the Naval Act of 1794 and the third constructed. The name “Constitution” was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-british-ships-did-the-uss-constitution-sink>How many British ships did the USS Constitution sink?</h2>
<p>nine<br>

<p>Constitution<br>
The greatest glory for Constitution, however, came during the War of 1812. Constitution’s crew defeated four British frigates during three separate engagements. She earned the nickname “Old Ironsides” because the cannon fire from enemy ships seemed as if they couldn’t penetrate her strong oak hull.</p>

<p>United States Ship/Full name</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-uss-constitution-called-the-old-ironsides>Why was the USS Constitution called the Old Ironsides?</h2>
<p>“Old Ironsides” was the nickname given to the 18th-century frigate, USS Constitution during the War of 1812 after its naval battle with the HMS Guerriere. The Constitution was one of the original six frigates of the United States Navy, commissioned by the Naval Act of 1794.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-uss-constitution-get-its-name>How did the USS Constitution get its name?</h2>
<p>Around 6 p.m., the two ships drew alongside about 25 yards apart. Constitution rocked Guerriere with a full broadside. Hull, eager to get a better view of the action, split his dress breeches as he leapt atop an arms chest.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-us-navy-frigate>What was the name of the US Navy frigate?</h2>
<p>For the United States Navy frigate, see USS Constitution. For other ships, see Constitution (disambiguation). The SS Constitution was an ocean liner owned by American Export Lines . Commissioned in 1951, she started her long career sailing on the New York City – Genoa – Naples – Gibraltar route to Europe.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-captain-of-the-constitution-ship>Who was the captain of the Constitution ship?</h2>
<p>The Constitution’s commander, Captain Isaac Hull, ordered the crew to unfurl all the ship’s sails and give chase. Within an hour the distance between the two ships had been shortened enough to allow the Captain to confirm that his prey was a British frigate. The Captain ordered an attack. The crew responded with cheers.</p>
