<h2 id=how-does-fuel-affect-pollution>How does fuel affect pollution?</h2>
<p>Gasoline use contributes to air pollution The vapors given off when gasoline evaporates and the substances produced when gasoline is burned (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and unburned hydrocarbons) contribute to air pollution. Burning gasoline also produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.</p>
<h2 id=does-fuel-make-pollution>Does fuel make pollution?</h2>
<p>When fuels are burned or combusted, a large number of chemicals are produced and emitted into the air. Pollutants caused by fuel combustion include particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, benzene, metals and sulphur dioxide, among others; many of these contribute to the creation of smog.</p>
<h2 id=which-fuel-is-the-main-cause-of-pollution>Which fuel is the main cause of pollution?</h2>
<p>In the US, coal and natural gas are the largest contributors to carbon pollution (constituting a third of all domestic carbon emissions). Methane released by production of natural gas, oil, and coal is second in importance.</p>
<h2 id=how-bad-is-fuel-for-the-environment>How bad is fuel for the environment?</h2>
<p>Transporting fuels from the mine or well can cause air pollution and lead to serious accidents and spills. When the fuels are burned, they emit toxins and global warming emissions. Even the waste products are hazardous to public health and the environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-least-pollution>What causes least pollution?</h2>
<p>Natural gas is the cleanest fuel and causes the least pollution when burnt compared to petrol, diesel and coal.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-burning-of-fossil-fuels-cause-pollution>How does the burning of fossil fuels cause pollution?</h2>
<p>Burning fossil fuels is the largest producer of pollution. Most fossil fuels are burned to turn into energy, and the gasses released into the air by burning, in turn causes air and water pollution. Gases released by the burning and combustion of fossil fuels include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and hydrocarbons.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-diesel-fuel-contribute-to-air-pollution>How does diesel fuel contribute to air pollution?</h2>
<p>Federal scientists are also looking into the environmental and health risks and benefits associated with further reductions in the sulphur content of gasoline. The combustion of diesel fuel in vehicles contributes significantly to air pollution.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-fuels-and-air-pollution-related-in-canada>How are fuels and air pollution related in Canada?</h2>
<p>Fuels and Air Pollution. When fuels are burned or combusted, a large number of chemicals are produced and emitted into the air. In fact, fuel consumption contributes greatly to air pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions: in 2007, transportation sector emissions represented about 27% of Canada’s total emissions inventory.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-cars-and-trucks-contribute-to-air-pollution>How are cars and trucks contribute to air pollution?</h2>
<p>1 Dirty cars, dirty air. Cars, trucks, and buses powered by fossil fuels are major contributors to air pollution. 2 The ingredients of air pollution. 3 The effects of air pollution. 4 Emissions from heavy-duty vehicles. 5 Clean air benefits of electric trucks and buses. 6 Cleaner air is on its way. …</p>
