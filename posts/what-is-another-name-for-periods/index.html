<h2 id=does-chumming-mean-period>Does chumming mean period?</h2>
<p>The Indian favourite which everyone’s aunties and grandmothers use to refer to their periods. In fact, ‘chum’ is so well-known as one’s period (probably even by the males in the family by now) that you might as well realise all subtlety is lost.</p>
<h2 id=which-age-periods-will-stop>Which age periods will stop?</h2>
<p>Menopause is the time that marks the end of your menstrual cycles. It’s diagnosed after you’ve gone 12 months without a menstrual period. Menopause can happen in your 40s or 50s, but the average age is 51 in the United States. Menopause is a natural biological process.</p>

<h2 id=why-is-period-called-aunt-flo>Why is period called Aunt Flo?</h2>
<p>1950s from aunt + the given name Flo (short for Florence), with punning allusion to flow.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-guys-have-instead-of-periods>What do guys have instead of periods?</h2>
<p>Of course, men don’t actually have the lovely bonafide PMS related to preparing the uterus and egg for fertilization. But some go through what’s called the male PMS: “IMS” (Irritable Male Syndrome). This can be attributed to men experiencing a drop in testosterone, the hormone that gives them their mojo.</p>
<h2 id=can-periods-be-stopped-permanently>Can periods be stopped permanently?</h2>
<p>If you want to stop having a period permanently you can have a surgical procedure to have your uterus removed, known as a hysterectomy, or a procedure that removes an internal part of the uterus, known as endometrial ablation.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-period-for-a-boy>What is a period for a boy?</h2>
<p>Guys don’t have periods because they don’t have a uterus, but their bodies develop and change too – the changes are just different. For example: their voice changes and they develop hair on their face and other parts of their bodies. So, although guys don’t get periods, their bodies do go through changes too.</p>
<h2 id=widely-used-phrases>Widely used phrases</h2>
<p>Malamang na ikaw ang kailangang magsimula ng pag-uusap ninyo tungkol sa pagreregla at ipagpatuloy ito. Referred to by many as the “curse,” the word “menstruation” comes from the Latin mensis, meaning “month.” Tinagurian ng marami bilang “sumpa,” ang salitang Ingles na “menstruation” ay mula sa salitang Latin na mensis, nangangahulugang “buwan.”</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-problems-with-the-menstrual-cycle>Are there any problems with the menstrual cycle?</h2>
<p>Other problems with the menstrual cycle include painful periods and abnormal bleeding such as bleeding between periods or heavy bleeding. Menstruation in other animals occur in primates ( apes and monkeys ). The menstrual cycle occurs due to the rise and fall of hormones.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-a-woman-stop-having-a-menstrual-cycle>When does a woman stop having a menstrual cycle?</h2>
<p>Perimenopause is when fertility in a female declines, and menstruation occurs less regularly in the years leading up to the final menstrual period, when a female stops menstruating completely and is no longer fertile. The medical definition of menopause is one year without a period and typically occurs between 45 and 55 in Western countries.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-lining-of-the-uterus-after-menstruation>What happens to the lining of the uterus after menstruation?</h2>
<p>The lining of the uterus (endometrium) becomes thicker and more enriched with blood in the second part of this phase (after menstruation is over), in response to increasing levels of estrogen.</p>
