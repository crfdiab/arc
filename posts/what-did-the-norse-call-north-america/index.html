<h2 id=what-did-the-norse-call-north-america>What did the Norse call North America?</h2>
<p>All the detail about Norse trips to Vinland (as the Norse called North America) comes from two accounts: The Saga of Erik the Red and The Saga of the Greenlanders.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-vikings-known-about-north-america>How did the Vikings known about North America?</h2>
<p>After traversing unfamiliar waters, the Norsemen aboard the wooden ship spied a new land, dropped anchor and went ashore. Half a millennium before Columbus “discovered” America, those Viking feet may have been the first European ones to ever have touched North American soil.</p>

<p>L’Anse aux Meadows<br>
The 1960 discovery of a Viking settlement at L’Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, Canada, caused a sensation, proving the sagas were not just fiction. Vikings had indeed reached the coast of America five centuries before Columbus.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-vikings-come-to-north-america>When did the Vikings come to North America?</h2>
<p>From there, according to the oral reports of the time (written down two centuries later in the Saga of the Greelanders and the Saga of Erik the Red), the Vikings stumbled upon North America around A.D. 1000. Over the next couple decades they made several expeditions to this new-to-them world.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-norse-live-in-north-america>Where did the Norse live in North America?</h2>
<p>The Norse settlements in the North American island of Greenland lasted for almost 500 years. L’Anse aux Meadows, the only confirmed Norse site in present-day Canada, was small and did not last as long. While voyages, for example to collect timber, are likely to have occurred for some time,…</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-vikings-go-before-columbus-arrived>Where did the Vikings go before Columbus arrived?</h2>
<p>These dramatic archaeological discoveries proved not only that the Vikings had indeed explored America some 500 years before Columbus’s arrival but also that they had traveled farther south to areas where grapes grew, to Vinland.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-viking-to-be-killed-by-the-natives>Who was the first Viking to be killed by the natives?</h2>
<p>Thorvald got into a fight with the local inhabitants, and he thus gained the distinction of being the first European to be killed by the natives in North America. (Vikings called the natives skraelings, a contemptuous term meaning “dwarves.”)</p>
