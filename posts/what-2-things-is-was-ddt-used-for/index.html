<h2 id=what-2-things-is-was-ddt-used-for>What 2 things is was DDT used for?</h2>
<p>DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) was developed as the first of the modern synthetic insecticides in the 1940s. It was initially used with great effect to combat malaria, typhus, and the other insect-borne human diseases among both military and civilian populations.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-2-problems-of-using-ddt-in-the-environment>What are 2 problems of using DDT in the environment?</h2>
<p>DDT is very insoluble in water and very persistent in the environment, making it a highly polluting hazard. It’s half life has been reported to be between 2 and 15 years.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-as-a-result-of-using-ddt>What happened as a result of using DDT?</h2>
<p>Human health effects from DDT at low environmental doses are unknown. Following exposure to high doses, human symptoms can include vomiting, tremors or shakiness, and seizures. Laboratory animal studies showed effects on the liver and reproduction. DDT is considered a possible human carcinogen.</p>
<h2 id=when-were-the-effects-of-ddt-discovered>When were the effects of DDT discovered?</h2>
<p>Its effectiveness as an insecticide, however, was only discovered in 1939. Shortly thereafter, particularly during World War II, the U.S. began producing large quantities of DDT for control of vector-borne diseases such as typhus and malaria abroad.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-ddt-last-in-the-environment>How long does DDT last in the environment?</h2>
<p>DDT lasts a very long time in soil. Half the DDT in soil will break down in 2–15 years. Some DDT will evaporate from soil and surface water into the air, and some is broken down by sunlight or by microscopic plants or animals in soil or surface water. DDT in soil usually breaks down to form DDE or DDD.</p>
<h2 id=why-should-ddt-be-banned>Why should DDT be banned?</h2>
<p>Because DDT can travel long distances and accumulate in the body, millions of humans and animals worldwide have buildups of the chemical in their tissue, even though it may have been used on another continent. …</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-ddt-take-to-ban>How long did DDT take to ban?</h2>
<p>ten years<br>
While many reasons exist as to why it took ten years to ban DDT after the publication of Silent Spring, the insecticide’s effectiveness in fighting malaria, public ignorance over the side effects of DDT before scientific research revealed the ill effects of DDT on wildlife, and the creation of the US Environmental …</p>
<h2 id=what-disease-does-ddt-cause>What disease does DDT cause?</h2>
<p>Liver cancer occurred in lab mice that were fed large amounts of DDT. Some studies in humans linked DDT levels in the body with breast cancer, but other studies have not made this link. Other studies in humans have linked exposure to DDT/DDE with having lymphoma, leukemia, and pancreatic cancer.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-ddt-on-the-environment>What was the impact of DDT on the environment?</h2>
<p>The impact of DDT on human health received worldwide attention from the general public, political and scientific communities, with the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring.1 In Silent Spring, Carson described a series of harmful effects on the environment and wildlife resulting from the use of DDT and other similar compounds.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-ddt-produced-in-the-united-states>When was DDT produced in the United States?</h2>
<p>From 1947 through 1982, Montrose manufactured and distributed DDT worldwide. In doing so, a byproduct mix of toxic sludge made up of petrochemicals, DDT and PCBs was produced. For decades, that hazardous waste was disposed of in two ways.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-scientist-who-discovered-ddt-in-the-ocean>Who was the scientist who discovered DDT in the ocean?</h2>
<p>That’s despite a startling report produced in the 1980s by a California Regional Water Quality Control Board scientist named Allan Chartrand, which asserted there may be as many as 500,000 barrels laced with DDT sitting on the ocean floor. The report was largely ignored.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-earth-day-movement-affect-air-pollution>How did the Earth Day movement affect air pollution?</h2>
<p>Out of this movement came events like Earth Day and legislative victories like the Clean Air Act (1970) and the Clean Water Act (1972). Global warming caused by air pollution continues to be a threat that the scientists of the world are racing to address.</p>
