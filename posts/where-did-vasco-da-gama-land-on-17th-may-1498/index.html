<p>Calicut<br>
But none succeeded except for Vasco Da Gama, a Portuguese sailor who became the first European to land in India on 17 May 1498 when he landed on the shores of Calicut in Kerala with four vessels.</p>
<h2 id=who-came-first-in-india-columbus-or-vasco-da-gama>Who came first in India Columbus or Vasco da Gama?</h2>
<p>As many as 523 years ago, Vasco da Gama completed the first European voyage to India. Christopher Columbus started his voyage in 1492, five years after Da Gama as he wanted to discover the sea route to India but his journey took him to America (Representative Image).</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama reaches India. Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama becomes the first European to reach India via the Atlantic Ocean when he arrives at Calicut on the Malabar Coast. Da Gama sailed from Lisbon, Portugal, in July 1497, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and anchored at Malindi on the east coast of Africa.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-fortress-of-vasco-da-gama-located>Where was the fortress of Vasco da Gama located?</h2>
<p>Born circa 1460, Vasco da Gama was the son of a minor nobleman who commanded the fortress at Sines, located on the coast of the Alentejo province in southwestern Portugal.</p>

<p>On this day, they landed on the Indian coast for the first time (Kappad beach in Southern India). The Indians were very hospitable. They organized a procession, and allegedly 3,000 people participated in it. Da Gama was even welcomed by the local ruler Zamorin, who was a powerful monarch. He ruled over the vast area, and lived a life of luxury.</p>

<p>Da Gama was even welcomed by the local ruler Zamorin, who was a powerful monarch. He ruled over the vast area, and lived a life of luxury. When Vasco da Gama gave him their gifts, Zamorin was disappointed. These were: six hats, four bathrobes, four branches of coral, boxes of sugar, honey, and two barrels of oil.</p>
