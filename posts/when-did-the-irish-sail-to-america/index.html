<h2 id=when-did-the-irish-sail-to-america>When did the Irish sail to America?</h2>
<p>It is estimated that as many as 4.5 million Irish arrived in America between 1820 and 1930. Between 1820 and 1860, the Irish constituted over one third of all immigrants to the United States. In the 1840s, they comprised nearly half of all immigrants to this nation.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-irish-come-to-america-in-the-early-1900s>Why did the Irish come to America in the early 1900s?</h2>
<p>Pushed out of Ireland by religious conflicts, lack of political autonomy and dire economic conditions, these immigrants, who were often called “Scotch-Irish,” were pulled to America by the promise of land ownership and greater religious freedom.</p>
<h2 id=do-catamarans-flip-easily>Do catamarans flip easily?</h2>
<p>So, do catamarans flip easy? No, catamarans do not flip easy. Most of the catamarans that you hear about flipping are racing catamarans that are highly engineered for maximum speed and they have very narrow hulls.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-ship-that-took-the-irish-to-america>What was the name of the ship that took the Irish to America?</h2>
<p>Appropriately, these treacherous sailing vessels became known as “coffin ships.” Most of the ships carrying Irish immigrants to America, however, were well built and adequately supplied.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-irish-migrate-to-the-us>When did the Irish migrate to the US?</h2>
<p>So wrote tailor James Chamberlain from Boston to his mother and brothers back in Mitchelstown, Co Cork in the early 1890s. He had arrived in 1888, one of about 4 million Irish who emigrated to the United States in the post-Famine era (1850 to 1929).</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-fly-from-ireland-to-america>How much does it cost to fly from Ireland to America?</h2>
<p>Fares averaged £8 (against £5 for Steerage), and was the preferred choice of many Irish-born Americans who had made their first crossing in Steerage; having enjoyed some success in the United States, they were prepared to pay the extra when returning permanently or temporarily to/from Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-irish-die-on-the-voyage>How did the Irish die on the voyage?</h2>
<p>As a result, many Irish immigrants contracted diseases such as typhus, and many others died before reaching land. Of the 100,000 Irish that sailed to British North America in 1847, one out of five died from disease and malnutrition. Appropriately, these treacherous sailing vessels became known as “coffin ships.”.</p>
