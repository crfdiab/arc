<h2 id=what-should-i-look-for-before-moving-to-a-new-city>What should I look for before moving to a new city?</h2>
<p>So be sure to look at the size of the city before you move there. This means looking at both the population numbers and the physical land area of the place. The physical size of the city is especially important when considering what your commute will be like and how you’ll get around.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-prepare-for-a-move-to-a-new-state>How to prepare for a move to a new state?</h2>
<p>Partner up with local real estate agents—one in your current city, and one in the place where you’re headed. Take a trip in advance of the move to scout things out. Get the lay of the land using Google Maps. Solidify your moving plans to get from A to B. Set up utilities with your new local provider.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-you-move-to-a-new-place>What happens when you move to a new place?</h2>
<p>Moving to a new place forces you to do just that. Whereas you may not have had much incentive before to get out there and meet new people, getting settled in a new city or country requires that you branch out and make connections. If you’re nervous about it, start out by just trying to meet your neighbors.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-i-move-to-a-new-city>When did I move to a new city?</h2>
<p>In February 2019, I moved from Nashville to Denver. I’d wanted to move here ever since I visited back in March 2017, and now it had finally happened. It was the first major, permanent move I made after graduating college, and I learned a lot.</p>
