<h2 id=is-switzerland-a-stable-economy>Is Switzerland a stable economy?</h2>
<p>The economy of Switzerland proved to be one of the world’s most stable economies for many reasons. Its long-term monetary security and political stability have made Switzerland a safe haven for investors, creating an economy that is increasingly dependent on a steady influx of foreign investment.</p>
<h2 id=is-switzerland-an-open-economy>Is Switzerland an open economy?</h2>
<p>Switzerland is an open and internationally engaged economy, reflected in high volumes of both gross and value added trade and investment. Almost 40% (in 2014) of economic activity (GDP) in Switzerland depends on foreign markets, one of the highest in the OECD.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-economy-does-switzerland-have-now>What kind of economy does Switzerland have now?</h2>
<p>Small-and medium-sized enterprises are the mainstay of the Swiss economy. However, the large number of multinationals based here are also major economic players. Poor in commodities but rich in a highly qualified workforce, Switzerland maintains intensive trade relations with the rest of the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-per-capita-gdp-of-switzerland>What is the per capita GDP of Switzerland?</h2>
<p>Switzerland, a country that espouses neutrality, is a prosperous and modern market economy with low unemployment, a highly skilled labor force, and a per capita GDP among the highest in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-tax-system-does-switzerland-have>What kind of tax system does Switzerland have?</h2>
<p>The Swiss tax system reflects the country’s federal structure. Competitive corporate tax rates set by the cantons make Switzerland an attractive location for companies, and many multinational corporations are based in Switzerland. However the mainstay of the economy are still small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-economy-of-switzerland-go-into-recession>When did the economy of Switzerland go into recession?</h2>
<p>The economy was affected by a three-year recession from 1991 to 1993, when the economy contracted by 2%. The contraction also became apparent in Switzerland’s energy consumption and export growth rates. Switzerland’s economy averaged no appreciable increase (only 0.6% annually) in GDP.</p>
