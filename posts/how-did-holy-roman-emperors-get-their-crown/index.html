<h2 id=how-did-holy-roman-emperors-get-their-crown>How did Holy Roman Emperors get their crown?</h2>
<p>Most Kings of the Romans were crowned with it until the end of the Holy Roman Empire. During the coronation, it was given to the new king along with the sceptre (German: Reichszepter) and the Imperial Orb (German: Reichsapfel).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-king-charlemagne-rise-to-power>How did King Charlemagne rise to power?</h2>
<p>When Pepin died in 768, his kingdom was divided between his two sons and for three years Charlemagne ruled with his younger brother Carloman. When Carloman died suddenly in 771, Charlemagne became sole ruler. As a token of thanks, Leo crowned Charlemagne on Christmas Day that year, declaring him emperor of the Romans.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-pope-crown-roman-emperors>Did the Pope crown Roman emperors?</h2>
<p>The Holy Roman Empresses were crowned as well. The Holy Roman Empire was established in the year 800 under Charlemagne. Later emperors were also crowned by the pope or other Catholic bishops. Thereafter, until the abolition of the empire in 1806, no further crownings by the Pope were held.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-holy-roman-emperors-were-crowned-by-the-pope>How many Holy Roman emperors were crowned by the Pope?</h2>
<p>four emperors<br>
Thereafter until the end of the empire there were in all only four emperors who were duly crowned: Charles IV, crowned by a legate in 1355; Sigismund, by the pope in 1433; Frederick III, in 1452; and Charles V, by the pope but at Bologna, in 1530.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-holy-roman-emperor-considered-a-supreme-power>Why was the Holy Roman Emperor considered a supreme power?</h2>
<p>The medieval theory of the ‘TranslatioEmpirii’ was to be regarded as the proof that there could only be one supreme emperor to govern material power. Indeed, the Holy Roman Emperor was to be regarded as the direct successor of the Roman emperors and his power was regarded as greater than all of the other European kings combined.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-the-holy-roman-empire>Who was the king of the Holy Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>Some, like “King of Germany” are less titular or symbolic than others, like “King of Arles” †. Others are honorific Roman-styled titles, meant to provide some sort of continuity between the Holy Roman Empire and the old Roman Empire (ignoring the Byzantine Empire, which sometimes brings disagreements).</p>
<h2 id=who-was-fighting-for-power-in-the-holy-roman-empire>Who was fighting for power in the Holy Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>The High Middle Ages was characterized by constant struggles for power. This lesson explores fighting between the papacy, Germany, and Italy for authority over the Holy Roman Empire.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-holy-roman-empire>What was the outcome of the Holy Roman Empire?</h2>
<p>The Holy Roman Empire never again reached the height it did under Frederick I Barbarossa. Future emperors avoided conflict with the volatile Italian city states. They also stopped seeking the imperial crown from the pope. German monarchs slowly ceased their attempt to gain power over German nobles.</p>
