<h2 id=what-time-is-the-sun-at-its-highest-point>What time is the sun at its highest point?</h2>
<p>noon<br>
The short answer to your question is simply “noon.” Astronomical noon is defined to be the time of day when the Sun is highest in the sky.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-longest-day-of-the-year-in-central-florida>What is the longest day of the year in Central Florida?</h2>
<p>June Solstice (Summer Solstice) is on Sunday, June 20, 2021 at 11:32 pm in Orlando. In terms of daylight, this day is 3 hours, 38 minutes longer than on December Solstice. In most locations north of Equator, the longest day of the year is around this date.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-best-place-to-watch-the-sunrise-in-florida>Where is the best place to watch the sunrise in Florida?</h2>

<h2 id=what-month-is-the-sun-at-its-highest>What month is the Sun at its highest?</h2>
<p>June 21<br>
The summer solstice for the northern hemisphere occurs within a few days of June 21 every year. It is on this day that the position of the Sun in the sky at noon is at its highest altitude of the year, and the position of the Sun at Sunrise and Sunset is farthest north for the year.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-sun-not-highest-in-the-sky-at-noon>Why is the Sun not highest in the sky at noon?</h2>
<p>The Sun reaches its highest point at a variety of times as the seasons change, not merely at noon every day. The reason for this is largely due to the second main contributor to the Sun’s apparent motion throughout the year: Earth’s orbit around the Sun is elliptical, not circular.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hours-of-daylight-in-summer-in-florida>How many hours of daylight in summer in Florida?</h2>
<p>The amount of daylight you’ll see on the solstice depends on your latitude, or distance from the equator. In the Lower 48, the sun is up for more than 10 hours across Florida and southern Texas, while states across the northern tier get under nine hours of daylight.</p>
<h2 id=what-part-of-florida-has-the-best-sunsets>What part of Florida has the best sunsets?</h2>
<p>Most of Florida’s best sunsets can be found on the state’s western coast and panhandle, facing the Gulf of Mexico. Bradenton Beach is no exception. Located on Anna Maria Island, just south of St. Petersburg, Bradenton Beach is surrounded on all sides by gorgeous blue waters.</p>
