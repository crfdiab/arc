<p>surface and expose them to weathering. Chemical weathering is the breaking down of rocks by changes in its chemical composition by oxygen and acids. Oxygen reacts with the iron that some rocks contain creating rust which weakens the rock, allowing it to be easily broken.</p>
<h2 id=is-breakdown-of-rock-into-smaller-pieces-chemical-or-mechanical-weathering>Is breakdown of rock into smaller pieces chemical or mechanical weathering?</h2>
<p>Weathering is the physical and chemical breakdown of rock at the earth’s surface. A. The physical breakdown of rock involves breaking rock down into smaller pieces through mechanical weathering processes.</p>
<h2 id=which-weathering-breaks-into-pieces>Which weathering breaks into pieces?</h2>
<p>Mechanical weathering (also called physical weathering) breaks rock into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are just like the bigger rock, just smaller. That means the rock has changed physically without changing its composition.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-a-rock-breaks-into-pieces>What is it called when a rock breaks into pieces?</h2>
<p>Weathering is the breaking down or dissolving of rocks and minerals on Earths surface. Once a rock has been broken down, a process called erosion transports the bits of rock and minerals away. Water, ice, acids, salts, plants, animals, and changes in temperature are all agents of weathering.</p>

<h2 id=what-does-mechanical-weathering-do-to-a-rock>What does mechanical weathering do to a rock?</h2>
<p>Mechanical weathering (also called physical weathering) breaks rock into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are just like the bigger rock, just smaller. That means the rock has changed physically without changing its composition. The smaller pieces have the same minerals, in just the same proportions as the original rock.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-weathering-is-broken-down-into-smaller-pieces>What kind of weathering is broken down into smaller pieces?</h2>
<p>The type of weathering in which rock is physically broken into smaller pieces but its chemical composition does not change. chemical weathering The process in which rock is broken down by changes in its chemical makeup often due to acid rain. biological weathering</p>
<h2 id=how-are-rocks-broken-down-at-the-surface>How are rocks broken down at the surface?</h2>
<p>Chemical or physical process that breaks down rocks into smaller pieces at or near the Earth’s surface. mechanical weathering. The type of weathering in which rock is physically broken into smaller pieces but its chemical composition does not change.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-rocks-to-peel-away-from-the-ground>What causes rocks to peel away from the ground?</h2>
<p>Thermal expansion can cause mechanical fracturing in rocks. Because of repeated expansion and contraction, this type of mechanical weathering can peel away at rocks. 3 Biological weathering and terrain abrasion</p>
