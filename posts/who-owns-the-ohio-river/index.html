<h2 id=who-owns-the-ohio-river>Who owns the Ohio River?</h2>
<p>In 1792, the federal government determined that Kentucky owned the Ohio River along its border with Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-ohio-river-run-through-west-virginia>Does the Ohio River run through West Virginia?</h2>
<p>The Ohio River flows through or borders six states: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</p>
<h2 id=who-has-jurisdiction-over-the-ohio-river>Who has jurisdiction over the Ohio River?</h2>
<p>On page 1010 of said opinion it is said: “Thus it is clearly settled that the state of Ohio has both civil and criminal jurisdiction over the waters of the Ohio river beyond the terri- torial limits of the state of Ohio, technically speaking, to-wit the western or northwestern low water mark of said river.”</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-eat-fish-from-ohio-river>Is it safe to eat fish from Ohio River?</h2>
<p>While most recreationally caught sport fish in the Ohio River are safe to eat, chemicals such as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been found in some fish from certain waters. It may take months or years of regularly eating contaminated fish to build up amounts that are a health concern.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-ohio-river-in-west-virginia>Where is the Ohio River in West Virginia?</h2>
<p>Ohio River. The Ohio River forms the western border of West Virginia between Penssylvania and Kentucky and, with its tributaries, drains more than three quarters of the Mountain State. Tributary rivers of the Ohio in West Virginia, beginning upstream, include the Little Kanawha River, the Kanawha River, the Guyandotte River,…</p>
<h2 id=why-did-west-virginia-lose-the-ohio-river>Why did West Virginia lose the Ohio River?</h2>
<p>The Court, however, ruled that because Virginia had owned the Ohio River originally, it should remain a part of Virginia’s domain, Carvell noted. As a result, when Virginia lost its westernmost counties, counties that became part of West Virginia, the river boundary went with them.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-different-states-claim-ownership-of-the-ohio-river>Why did different states claim ownership of the Ohio River?</h2>
<p>Ohio River at Gallipolis, Gallia County, Ohio. The photograph was taken ca. 1940-1949. Since the late 1700s, various states have claimed ownership of various stretches of the Ohio River. The principal reason was to garner wealth from the trade that occured on the river.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-ohio-river-important-to-virginia>Why was the Ohio River important to Virginia?</h2>
<p>As a result, the low-water mark on the western bank of the Ohio River became the western boundary of Virginia. When Ohio became a state in 1803, it sought greater control over this major waterway, considering it a key economic element.</p>
