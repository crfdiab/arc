<h2 id=why-is-oil-known-as-black-gold>Why is oil known as black gold?</h2>
<p>Crude Oil is also known as Black Gold. The word ‘Black’ because of its appearance when it comes out of the ground and the term ‘Gold’ for of its rarity and utility associated with it.</p>
<h2 id=is-safe-gold-safe>Is safe gold safe?</h2>
<p>Safe gold is a fraud company. I invested 3 lacs in it but while selling i got just 265000 in return. Its not just that it depends on market. I can understand that but their selling rate is way low the buy rate which does not make sense.</p>

<h2 id=how-do-you-identify-gold-from-saudi-arabia>How do you identify gold from Saudi Arabia?</h2>
<p>Being a pure metal, Saudi gold tends to sit down in the water while other metals tend to float. So, take a jar, fill with water and add the gold to it. If it sinks: you have real Saudi gold, if it floats it is fake. To identify Saudi gold, place a heavy magnet (not ordinary one) close to the jewelry to be tested.</p>
