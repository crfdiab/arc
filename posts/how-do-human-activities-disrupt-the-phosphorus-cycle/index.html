<h2 id=how-do-human-activities-disrupt-the-phosphorus-cycle>How do human activities disrupt the phosphorus cycle?</h2>
<p>Humans affect the phosphorus cycle mainly by the use of fertilizers and raising livestock, especially hogs. Fertilizers and hog waste are high in phosphorus, which makes its way into the soil (where it is necessary in moderate amounts) and, due to runoff, in water.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-humans-changing-the-phosphorus-cycle>How are humans changing the phosphorus cycle?</h2>
<p>Humans greatly influence the phosphorus cycle through the release of mined phosphates into ecosystems, especially in the form of fertilizers, but also from detergents and sewage waste.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-humans-destroying-phosphorus>How are humans destroying phosphorus?</h2>
<p>Humans have altered the phosphorus cycle by adding phosphorus for crop production and removing phosphorus through soil management practices, which leads to erosion and leaching.</p>
<h2 id=what-human-activities-increase-phosphorus-levels>What human activities increase phosphorus levels?</h2>
<p>Human actions—mining phosphorus (P) and transporting it in fertilizers, animal feeds, agricultural crops, and other products—are altering the global P cycle, causing P to accumulate in some of the world’s soil. Increasing P levels in the soil elevate the potential P runoff to aquatic ecosystems (Fluck et al.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-phosphorus-returned-to-the-cycle-from-the-ocean>How is phosphorus returned to the cycle from the ocean?</h2>
<p>When animals and plants die, phosphates will return to the soils or oceans again during decay. After that, phosphorus will end up in sediments or rock formations again, remaining there for millions of years. Eventually, phosphorus is released again through weathering and the cycle starts over.</p>

<p>Human impact on the phosphorus Cycle. How we affect the phosphorus cycle Synthetic fertilizers are a main way humans impact the phosphorus cycle. The phosphate in the fertilizer is not fully utilized by plants, and as a result leftover phosphates remain in the plants’ water supply. This remaining phosphate leaves as water run-off. Misuse…</p>

<p>Then, during the spring, the ice may thaw and the phosphates may turn into run-off. Municipal sewage plants also supply phosphates to the water. If not treated, the phosphates in our sewage will not be removed, and will remain in our water supply. Excessive phosphorus in our water supplies can have negative consequences for humans.</p>

<p>If not treated, the phosphates in our sewage will not be removed, and will remain in our water supply. Excessive phosphorus in our water supplies can have negative consequences for humans. It can result in excessive plant growth (including algae).</p>
