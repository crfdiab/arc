<p>These dramatic scenes of violent police aggression against civil rights protesters from Birmingham, Alabama were vivid examples of segregation and racial injustice in America. Public outrage over the events in Birmingham produced political pressure that helped to ensure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-birmingham-play-an-important-role-in-the-civil-rights-movement>How did Birmingham play an important role in the civil rights movement?</h2>
<p>In 1963, Birmingham became a focus for the civil rights movement. Both SNCC and the NAACP were relatively inactive in Birmingham; so any civil rights campaign could be lead by SCLC without too much rivalry. Martin Luther King’s brother was also a pastor in the city so family connections helped the role of SCLC.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-the-birmingham-campaign-influence-the-civil-rights-movement>How did the Birmingham campaign influence the Civil Rights Movement?</h2>
<p>The Birmingham campaign inspired the Civil Rights Movement in other parts of the South. Two days after King and Shuttlesworth announced the settlement in Birmingham, Medgar Evers of the NAACP in Jackson, Mississippi demanded a biracial committee to address concerns there. On June 12, 1963, Evers was murdered by a KKK member outside his home.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-birmingham-desegregation-campaign>What was the outcome of the Birmingham desegregation campaign?</h2>
<p>Desegregation would take place slowly over the next few months coupled with violent attacks from angry segregationists, including the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church that killed four young girls. Learn more about some of the events that followed the campaign and the city’s continued push for integration.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-albany-movement-affect-the-birmingham-campaign>How did the Albany Movement affect the Birmingham campaign?</h2>
<p>Described by historian Henry Hampton as a “morass”, the Albany Movement lost momentum and stalled. King’s reputation had been hurt by the Albany campaign, and he was eager to improve it.
