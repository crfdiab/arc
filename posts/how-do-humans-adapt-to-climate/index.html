<h2 id=how-do-humans-adapt-to-climate>How do humans adapt to climate?</h2>
<p>Humans can adapt to climate change by reducing their vulnerability to its impacts. Actions such as moving to higher ground to avoid rising sea levels, planting new crops that will thrive under new climate conditions, or using new building technologies represent adaptation strategies.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-climate-affect-people-in-brazil>How does the climate affect people in Brazil?</h2>
<p>The impacts of climate change in Brazil, which harbors nearly 60% of the Amazon, vary significantly and are vast: higher temperatures may change the range and distribution of temperature sensitive species, increased severity of drought can greatly affect the Amazon’s freshwater ecosystems and the people that rely on …</p>
<h2 id=how-have-people-used-the-environment-in-brazil>How have people used the environment in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Brazilians are very dependent on their environment for many things including agriculture, mineral resources, and physical structures that the geography of Brazil provides. In Brazil 1/5 of the people who work are involved in agriculture. Major Crops are: coffee (worlds leading producer)</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-climate-do-the-citizens-of-brazil-live-in>What type of climate do the citizens of Brazil live in?</h2>
<p>humid tropical and subtropical climate<br>
Brazil has a humid tropical and subtropical climate except for a drier area in the Northeast, sometimes called the drought quadrilateral or drought polygon, that extends from northern Bahia to the coast between Natal and São Luís; that zone receives about 15–30 inches (375–750 mm) of precipitation a year.</p>
<h2 id=do-humans-have-adaptations>Do humans have adaptations?</h2>
<p>Humans have biological plasticity, or an ability to adapt biologically to our environment. An adaptation is any variation that can increase one’s biological fitness in a specific environment; more simply it is the successful interaction of a population with its environment.</p>
<h2 id=can-humans-adapt-to-the-cold>Can humans adapt to the cold?</h2>
<p>In conclusion, human cold adaptation in the form of increased metabolism and insulation seems to have occurred during recent evolution in populations, but cannot be developed during a lifetime in cold conditions as encountered in temperate and arctic regions.</p>
<h2 id=is-brazil-prone-to-natural-disasters>Is Brazil prone to natural disasters?</h2>
<p>Since it lies outside the pathway frequented by major hurricanes and has no active volcanos or inhabited areas subject to strong earthquakes, Brazil is not listed among the countries most susceptible to natural disasters. It is ranked 123rd in a world index of countries most vulnerable to cataclysmic events.</p>
<h2 id=is-climate-change-bad-in-brazil>Is climate change bad in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Global warming can jeopardize Brazilian food production, leading to losses that can reach 7.4 billion reals in 2020 and up to 14 billion in 2070; Soy, whose explosive growth in the last 30 years has triggered an unprecedented change in the country’s economic structure, is likely to be the crop most affected.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-environmental-problem-in-brazil>What is the biggest environmental problem in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Deforestation<br>
Deforestation has been a significant source of pollution, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, but deforestation has been Brazil’s foremost cause of environmental and ecological degradation.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-brazil-so-polluted>Why is Brazil so polluted?</h2>
<p>Air Pollution Air pollution in Brazil is mainly due to rapid urbanization in several cities that lacked the infrastructure to support rapid population growth. A recent World Bank study ranked the Brazilian cities Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Curitiba as the four most polluted cities in the country.</p>
<h2 id=why-snowfall-does-not-occur-in-brazil>Why snowfall does not occur in Brazil?</h2>
<p>It is very hot as well as cold in Brazil. The average temperature of Brazil is between 18°C to 28°C throughout the year. This kind of temperature is not suitable for snowfall. Thus, snowfall doesn’t always occur in Brazil.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-people-of-brazil-adapt-to-their-environment>How did the people of Brazil adapt to their environment?</h2>
<p>They also adapt by making clothes to match their weather and building farms near fertile soils. There is very warm weather in Brazil because it is by the equator. People in Brazil are already comfortable in what they are doing now. They are doing hard work and while we have a lot of technology unlike them.</p>
<h2 id=how-have-the-people-adapted-to-their-environment>How have the people adapted to their environment?</h2>
<p>How have the people adapted to their environment? The climate in Brazil is hot and moist, so people where light clothes. They also adapt by making clothes to match their weather and building farms near fertile soils. There is very warm weather in Brazil because it is by the equator.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-weather-so-warm-in-brazil>Why is the weather so warm in Brazil?</h2>
<p>There is very warm weather in Brazil because it is by the equator. People in Brazil are already comfortable in what they are doing now. They are doing hard work and while we have a lot of technology unlike them.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-people-in-brazil-contributing-to-natural>How are people in Brazil contributing to natural?</h2>
<p>The same ecosystems, however, provide natural protection for humans. For instance, forests on hills prevent landslides and floods. The roots stabilise slopes and absorb large volumes of water during rainstorms. Brazil’s southern and southeastern states are particularly affected by increasingly frequent extreme weather.</p>
