<h2 id=how-did-william-duke-of-normandy-control-england>How did William Duke of Normandy control England?</h2>
<p>Claiming his right to the English throne, William, duke of Normandy, invades England at Pevensey on Britain’s southeast coast. His subsequent defeat of King Harold II at the Battle of Hastings marked the beginning of a new era in British history.</p>
<h2 id=how-successful-was-william-at-controlling-england>How successful was William at controlling England?</h2>
<p>William used the methods of control that he was most familiar with: castles and the feudal system. But he also adopted a new method in the form of the Domesday Book. From their castles, the new Norman lords could control the local area, and the sight of them made it clear who was now in control.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-normans-in-england>Who was the leader of the Normans in England?</h2>
<p>Who was the leader of the Normans? William, Duke of Normandy. William was born in 1027. He became duke of Normandy when he was only seven years old. Why did William the Conqueror invade England? William laid claim to the English throne after Edward died.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-william-come-to-power-in-england>How did William come to power in England?</h2>
<p>How did William come to power in England? At the Battle of Hastings on October 14, 1066, William, duke of Normandy, defeated the forces of Harold II, king of England, and then was himself crowned king as William I, leading to profound political, administrative, and social changes in the British Isles as result of the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>If I conquer England now, Normandy will be protected. [you may want to have a map of Europe in 1066 on the wall and point to the appropriate places as you talk] In addition, England is a wealthy country. The Romans occupied England for 500 years. They created good roads, wealthy towns and trading centres.</p>
