<p>Their fur is naturally oily and waterproof. There are two species of beavers, which are found in the forests of North America, Europe, and Asia. These animals are active all winter, swimming and foraging in their ponds even when a layer of ice covers the surface.</p>
<h2 id=are-beavers-from-north-america>Are beavers from North America?</h2>
<p>The North American beaver (Castor canadensis) is one of two extant beaver species, along with the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber). It is native to North America and introduced in South America (Patagonia) and Europe (primarily Finland and Karelia).</p>
<h2 id=what-continents-do-beavers-live-on>What continents do beavers live on?</h2>
<p>These animals are thus found in three continents namely; Europe, Asia, and North America. Beavers are the second largest rodents in the world and are known for building lodges, canals, and dams across waterways.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-beavers-found-in-the-world>Where are beavers found in the world?</h2>
<p>Beavers inhabit forested regions across Canada and north to the treeline, but are infrequent on the prairies. Typically, they occupy slow-flowing streams, where they construct dams of sticks, logs, debris and mud. The beaver is one of the only mammals, other than humans, that can manufacture its own environment.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-rodents-have-yellow-teeth>Why do rodents have yellow teeth?</h2>
<p>The tooth enamel of rodents is very hard and often orange-yellow due to the incorporation of iron-containing pigments. In the wild, rodent teeth wear naturally through the consumption of hard foodstuffs and gnawing behavior.</p>

<h2 id=will-a-beaver-attack-a-human>Will a beaver attack a human?</h2>
<p>If trapped or cornered, a beaver will attack a human. Beavers carry tularemia, parasites, and rabies, which can transfer through bites, body fluids, or infected water. Before beavers attack humans or other animals, they send a warning by growling and hissing. On land, the animal rises to its hind legs to face a threat.</p>
