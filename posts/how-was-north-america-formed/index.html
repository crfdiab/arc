<h2 id=how-was-north-america-formed>How was North America formed?</h2>
<p>Birth of North America The Atlantic Ocean opened 200 million years ago, pushing North America westward. As the continent rifted away from the supercontinent Pangaea, it finally earned the name North America.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-oldest-part-of-north-america>Is the oldest part of North America?</h2>
<p>At a spritely age of just 200 million years old, North America is one of the younger continents on planet Earth. The oldest part of North America is the Craton. The Craton makes up most of the North Eastern and Midwest regions of The United States as well as most of Canada and Greenland.</p>
<h2 id=was-america-once-underwater>Was America once underwater?</h2>
<p>As with most of the continents, the majority of North America was underwater throughout the Cambrian Period. Small landmasses in the central part of the continent shed sediment in this shallow sea.</p>
<h2 id=what-part-of-america-was-underwater>What part of America was underwater?</h2>
<p>During the Late Cretaceous the Gulf of Mexico had expanded through North America until reaching Alaska. Up to half of the continent’s modern surface area may have been submerged by this sea. This is called the Western Interior Seaway.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-the-united-states-of-america>What was the history of the United States of America?</h2>
<p>History of North America. Conflict over resources on North America ensued in various wars between these powers, but, gradually, the new European colonies developed desires for independence. Revolutions, such as the American Revolution and Mexican War of Independence, created new, independent states that came to dominate North America.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-people-who-built-the-united-states>Who are the people who built the United States?</h2>
<p>People who built America. The history of the United States typically begins with the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492. The key people who helped found the early American colonies, include the settlers from Europe, seeking a life in America.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-people-of-north-america-come-from>Where did the people of North America come from?</h2>
<p>The people of north America: 1500 BC – 1500 AD The original people of north America live in a wide range of environments. The natives of this region derive their crops from the more advanced civilization to the south, in Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-agriculture-invented-in-the-united-states>Where was agriculture invented in the United States?</h2>
<p>Agriculture was invented independently in two regions of North America: the Eastern Woodlands and Mesoamerica. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world, such as tomatoes and squash.</p>
