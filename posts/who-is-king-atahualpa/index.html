<h2 id=who-is-king-atahualpa>Who is king Atahualpa?</h2>
<p>Atahualpa became Inca emperor in May 1532 after he had defeated and imprisoned Huáscar and massacred any pretenders to the throne. The Spaniard Francisco Pizarro captured Atahualpa in November 1532 and used him to control the Inca Empire.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-spain-when-francisco-pizarro-went-on-expeditions>Who was the king of Spain when Francisco Pizarro went on expeditions?</h2>
<p>King Charles of Spain<br>
King Charles of Spain agreed to Pizarro’s request and promised him that he would be governor of any lands he conquered. In 1531, Pizarro and his crew, including three of his half-brothers—Gonzalo, Hernando and Juan Pizarro—sailed from Panama.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-francisco-pizarro-friends-with>Who was Francisco Pizarro friends with?</h2>
<p>explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa<br>
Pizarro eventually became friends with explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa. In 1513, he joined Balboa on his expeditions. He was even a member of Balboa’s famous expedition that crossed the Isthmus of Panama to reach the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=who-killed-the-inca-king>Who killed the Inca king?</h2>
<p>Francisco Pizarro<br>
Atahuallpa, the 13th and last emperor of the Incas, dies by strangulation at the hands of Francisco Pizarro’s Spanish conquistadors. The execution of Atahuallpa, the last free reigning emperor, marked the end of 300 years of Inca civilization.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-francisco-pizarro-and-what-did-he-do>Who was Francisco Pizarro and what did he do?</h2>
<p>When Francisco Pizarro died in 1541, he was the Marquis de la Conquista, a wealthy nobleman with vast lands, wealth, prestige, and influence. It is a far cry from his beginnings. He was born sometime in the 1470s (the exact date and year are unknown) as the illegitimate child of a Spanish soldier and a household servant.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-last-brother-of-francisco-pizarro-to-die>Who was the last brother of Francisco Pizarro to die?</h2>
<p>However, Almagro had a son who swore revenge, and in 1541, Pizarro was killed in his palace in Lima by a number of men following Diego Almagro the younger. He was himself caught and executed the following year, so was the last brother of Pizarro struggling for power in Peru, in 1548.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-francisco-pizarro-open-fire-on-the-incans>When did Francisco Pizarro open fire on the Incans?</h2>
<p>On 16 November 1532, Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish explorer and conquistador, springs a trap on the Incan emperor, Atahualpa. With fewer than 200 men against several thousand, Pizarro lures Atahualpa to a feast in the emperor’s honour and then opens fire on the unarmed Incans.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-in-the-expedition-with-gonzalo-pizarro>Who was in the expedition with Gonzalo Pizarro?</h2>
<p>Hernando de Soto was a loyal lieutenant who would later lead an expedition into the southeast of the present-day USA. Francisco de Orellana accompanied Gonzalo Pizarro on an expedition and wound up discovering the Amazon River . Pedro de Valdivia went on to be the first governor of Chile.</p>
