<p>17 November 1558<br>
Elizabethan era/Start dates</p>
<h2 id=did-people-date-in-the-elizabethan-era>Did people date in the Elizabethan Era?</h2>
<p>Both Courting and dating were very rare in the middle to upper classes due to arranged marriage but was most common in the lower class.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-elizabeths-reign-called-the-golden-age>Why was Elizabeth’s reign called the Golden Age?</h2>
<p>Her reign was a time of art, music and literature with the talents of William Shakespeare flourishing at this time. It is often known as ‘the Golden Age of English history’. Her long reign created stability. By the end of her reign, the Church of England was safe, and there was no chance of a War of Religion.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-rules-for-dating-during-the-elizabethan-era>What were the rules for dating during the Elizabethan era?</h2>
<p>You didn’t marry for love, you married for social standing and to legitimize your children. While it was legal for boys to marry at age 14 and girls to marry at age 12, Elizabethans “reached the age of consent” at age 21, and many did in fact wait until then to marry.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-elizabethan-age-start-and-end>When did the Elizabethan age start and end?</h2>
<p>The Elizabethan Age is the time period associated with the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603) and is often considered to be a golden age in English history. [3]</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-elizabethan-prayer-book-come-out>When did the Elizabethan prayer book come out?</h2>
<p>The Elizabethan Prayer book was introduced for the first time on June 24, 1559. 1560 – On July 6, the Queen of England signed the Treaty of Edinburgh between England, France and Scotland. 1561 – Queen Elizabeth the First signed a Treaty at Hampton Court promising to support the French Huguenots.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-catholic-queen-during-the-elizabethan-period>Who was the Catholic Queen during the Elizabethan period?</h2>
<p>Elizabethan Period Timeline 1570-1579 1590-1603 1558-1603 1558 -1569 1558-1559 Queen Mary I Queen Mary I was Catholic queen who was succeeded by her Anglican sister Elizabeth. [1]</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-second-monarch-with-the-name-elizabeth>Who was the second monarch with the name Elizabeth?</h2>
<p>Firstly, Queen Elizabeth II is the second monarch with the name, and the first, Queen Elizabeth I, already has “dibs” on the “Elizabethan Age”, which is part of the “Tudor Era”. The “Georgian” period was in the 1700’s (1740–1820), and fortunately there were FOUR King Georges during that period, one after another!</p>
