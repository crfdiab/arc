<h2 id=which-environmental-lesson-can-you-derive-from-the-ecocide>Which environmental lesson can you derive from the ecocide?</h2>
<p>Explanation : The environmental lesson that can be derived from the ecocide hypothesis for the conditions that occurred in easter island is that the climatic changes has the drastic effects on all the organisms of the environment. As they are directly or indirectly dependent on environment for their needs.</p>
<h2 id=which-event-was-the-most-immediate-action-taken-after-publication-of-rachel-carsons-book-silent-spring>Which event was the most immediate action taken after publication of Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring?</h2>
<p>Answer: The immediate action taken after publication of Rachel Carson’s book silent spring is the awareness of people towards the use of chemical pesticides. Many chemical industry wants to ban this book but it succeeded to ban the use of several pesticides.</p>
<h2 id=which-factor-is-least-important-in-the-issue-of-whether-to-allow-offshore-oil-drilling-in-the-united-states>Which factor is least important in the issue of whether to allow offshore oil drilling in the United States?</h2>
<p>Amount of sun striking the area has no major effect on offshore drilling so it is not a major factor in the issue of whether to allow offshore oil drilling in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-is-the-best-definition-of-remote-sensing>Which of the following is the best definition of remote sensing?</h2>
<p>Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft). Special cameras collect remotely sensed images, which help researchers “sense” things about the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-ecocide-hypothesis>What is the ecocide hypothesis?</h2>
<p>One of them is the ecocide hypothesis, stating that the population once suffered a big collapse because they overexploited the natural resources on the island. The other hypothesis is that a collapse occurred after the Europeans came to the island.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-did-not-contribute-to-the-collapse-of-mesopotamian-civilization>Which of the following did not contribute to the collapse of Mesopotamian civilization?</h2>
<p>Which of the following did not contribute to the collapse of Mesopotamian civilization? Seasonal irritation.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-environmental-impact-of-oil-exploration>What is the environmental impact of oil exploration?</h2>
<p>Exploring and drilling for oil may disturb land and marine ecosystems. Seismic techniques used to explore for oil under the ocean floor may harm fish and marine mammals.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-applications-of-remote-sensing>What are the main applications of Remote sensing?</h2>
<p>The primary application of remote sensing?</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyzing the condition of rural roads.</li>
<li>Creating a base map for visual reference.</li>
<li>Computing snow pack.</li>
<li>Collecting earth’s pictures from space.</li>
<li>Controlling forest fires.</li>
<li>Detecting land use and land cover.</li>
<li>Estimating forest supplies.</li>
<li>Locating construction and building alteration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-remote-sensing-is-science-and-art>Why Remote sensing is science and art?</h2>
<p>“Remote sensing is the science (and to some extent, art) of acquiring information about the Earth’s surface without actually being in contact with it. This is done by sensing and recording reflected or emitted energy and processing, analyzing, and applying that information.”</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-conclusion-from-the-study-of-mesopotamia>Which is a conclusion from the study of Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>No one can predict future trends accurately. What conclusion from the study of Mesopotamia can be used in irrigation practices today? Irrigation methods with the least impact on the water table may be beneficial. Where do environmental scientists usually publish reports on their experiments, for an audience of their professional colleagues?</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-irrigation-system-important-to-ancient-mesopotamia>Why was the irrigation system important to ancient Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>Together with the change of river flow this irrigation system stimulates throughout the Mesopotamian history and laid the foundation of new settlements and cities in ancient Mesopotamia which in turn contributed in the formation of the cradle of civilizations. In 1258, the Mongols conquered Mesopotamia and destroyed the irrigation systems.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-mesopotamia-the-first-civilization-in-the-world>Why was Mesopotamia the first civilization in the world?</h2>
<p>Mesopotamia- The First of the World. Mesopotamia was the strongest civilization because of its great Irrigation System and the controlling of water. It was strong because of its Gov’t and the way the King ran the Kingdom with all of those many duties.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-agriculture-of-mesopotamia-begin-to-decay>Why did the agriculture of Mesopotamia begin to decay?</h2>
<p>Over the centuries, the agriculture of Mesopotamia began to decay because of the salt in the alluvial soil. [3]</p>
