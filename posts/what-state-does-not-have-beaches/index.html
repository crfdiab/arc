<h2 id=what-happens-in-the-first-half-of-flatland>What happens in the first half of flatland?</h2>
<p>The first half of the story goes through the practicalities of existing in a two-dimensional universe as well as a history leading up to the year 1999 on the eve of the 3rd Millennium. On New Year’s Eve, the Square dreams about a visit to a one-dimensional world (Lineland) inhabited by “lustrous points”.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-book-flatland-written-by-a-square>Why was the book Flatland written by a square?</h2>
<p>Written pseudonymously by “A Square”, the book used the fictional two-dimensional world of Flatland to comment on the hierarchy of Victorian culture, but the novella’s more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions.</p>
