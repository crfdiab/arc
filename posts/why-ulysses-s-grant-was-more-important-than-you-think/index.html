<h2 id=why-ulysses-s-grant-was-more-important-than-you-think>Why Ulysses S Grant was more important than you think?</h2>
<p>Grant’s presidency is often overlooked, but his accomplishments around civil rights are getting more consideration from historians. While other Union generals dithered, Grant took aggressive action against the rebellious states of the Confederacy. …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-unique-about-ulysses-s-grant>What was unique about Ulysses S Grant?</h2>
<p>One of the most influential Americans of the 19th century, Grant led the Union Army to victory during the Civil War and later helped steer the nation through Reconstruction during two terms as president.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-ulysses-s-grant-on-the-50-dollar-bill>Why is Ulysses S Grant on the 50 dollar bill?</h2>
<p>“Reagan was a fine president,” said Stan Purdy, a Georgetown lawyer and president since 1996 of the U.S. Grant Homestead Association. “But Grant was put there (on the $50 bill) to recognize his position in the history of our country, and his role as president and the winning general of the Civil War.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-general-was-grant>What kind of general was Grant?</h2>
<p>Union general<br>
Grant is best known as the Union general who led the United States to victory over the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a two-term President, he is typically dismissed as weak and ineffective; historians have often ranked Grant’s presidency near the bottom in American history.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-ulysses-s-grant-do-in-office>What did Ulysses S Grant do in office?</h2>
<p>In 1865, as commanding general, Ulysses S. Grant led the Union Armies to victory over the Confederacy in the American Civil War. As an American hero, Grant was later elected the 18th President of the United States (1869–1877), working to implement Congressional Reconstruction and to remove the vestiges of slavery.</p>
<h2 id=is-ulysses-s-grant-on-any-money>Is Ulysses S Grant on any money?</h2>
<p>The United States fifty-dollar bill ($50) is a denomination of United States currency. The 18th U.S. president (1869-1877), Ulysses S. Grant, is featured on the obverse, while the U.S. Capitol is featured on the reverse.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-not-know-about-ulysses-sgrant>What do you not know about Ulysses s.grant?</h2>
<p>10 Things You May Not Know About Ulysses S. Grant 1. The “S” in Grant’s name didn’t stand for anything. 2. He was notoriously unlucky in business. 3. Grant won the first major Union victory of the Civil War. 4. He struggled with alcohol throughout his life. 5. Grant hated wearing army uniforms.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-ulysses-sgrant-want-to-capture-armies>Why did Ulysses s.grant want to capture armies?</h2>
<p>He wanted to capture armies, not places, because when you took out an opponent you reshaped the entire conflict. Thus when Grant won the first major victory of the Civil War for the North at Fort Donelson in 1862, he demanded “Unconditional Surrender.” (And yes, this did give “U.S.” Grant a seriously great nickname for the rest of his life.)</p>
<h2 id=where-was-ulysses-sgrant-national-historic-site>Where was Ulysses s.grant National Historic Site?</h2>
<p>Friends at the Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site near St. Louis tell me most visitors arrive with little knowledge of Grant—but leave with deep appreciation. In my biography of Abraham Lincoln, I wrote of Grant, the decorated Civil War general, but I now confess: I did not fully know the man.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-ulysses-sgrant-busted-for-racing-his-horse>Why was Ulysses s.grant busted for racing his horse?</h2>
<p>Even in the White House, Grant was busted by the police for racing his horse through the streets. Quite simply, Grant was happiest engaged in feats that would cripple lesser riders. You can’t be an elite horseman and hammered out of your skull simultaneously—not for long, anyway.</p>
