<h2 id=where-is-irish-most-commonly-spoken>Where is Irish most commonly spoken?</h2>
<p>Ireland<br>
The great majority — about 98 percent — of Irish speakers live in Ireland itself. The 2016 census in Ireland found that only about 10.5 percent of respondents spoke Irish on a daily or weekly basis, and that dropped to 4.2 percent when looking at regular, active speakers.</p>
<h2 id=how-widely-spoken-is-irish-in-ireland>How widely spoken is Irish in Ireland?</h2>
<p>The 2016 census showed that inhabitants of the officially designated Gaeltacht regions of Ireland numbered 96,090 people: down from 96,628 in the 2011 census. Of these, 66.3% claimed to speak Irish, down from 68.5% in 2011; and only 21.4% or 20,586 people said they spoke Irish daily outside the education system.</p>
<h2 id=what-cities-in-ireland-speak-irish>What cities in Ireland speak Irish?</h2>
<p>What cities in Ireland speak the most Irish?</p>
<ul>
<li>Rural Area – 44.6 percent.</li>
<li>Galway City and suburbs – 41.4 percent.</li>
<li>Cork City and suburbs – 40.9 percent.</li>
<li>Limerick City and suburbs – 37.6 percent.</li>
<li>Waterford City and suburbs – 34.1 percent.</li>
<li>Dublin City and suburbs – 32.8 percent.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=will-ireland-ever-speak-irish-again>Will Ireland ever speak Irish again?</h2>
<p>Never say never, but it’s very unlikely. Irish has been in decline across the country for over 200 years; to the extent that it’s no longer spoken as the main language in anywhere but the most marginal communities.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-irish-and-gaelic>What is the difference between Irish and Gaelic?</h2>
<p>The distinction is not subtle: “Irish” refers to the native language of Ireland, and “Gaelic” refers to the major native language of Scotland, although the term came into common usage only in the past two hundred years, or less.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-speak-the-irish-language-in-ireland>How many people speak the Irish language in Ireland?</h2>
<p>The CSO found that in 2016, there were more female Irish language speakers (968,777, or 55 percent) in Ireland than male Irish language speakers (792,643, or 45 percent.) 49% – The percentage of the population of Galway County who could speak Irish in 2016 (84,249 persons)</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-irish-speaking-town-in-ireland>Which is the largest Irish speaking town in Ireland?</h2>
<p>Within the Gaeltachts, the three towns with the largest percentage of daily Irish speakers are Mín Lárach (73.3 percent) and Rann na Feirste (66.6 percent), both in County Donegal, and An Cheathrú Rua in County Galway (61.6 percent).

<h2 id=where-can-i-learn-the-language-of-ireland>Where can I learn the language of Ireland?</h2>
<p>They are found in some of the most beautiful and striking landscapes of Ireland. Eoin Ó Conchúir — a native Irish Gaelic speaker who was not lucky enough to grow up in the Gaeltacht — founded Bitesize Irish Gaelic with his wife Saša. There, guests can come to learn Irish Gaelic online in bite-sized chunks.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-the-majority-of-irish-speakers-live>Where do the majority of Irish speakers live?</h2>
<p>Of the daily Irish speakers from the 2016 Census, 20 percent live in Dublin and just over 8 percent live in Cork, Galway, and Limerick. Where is Gaelic spoken? Galway County recorded the highest percentages of persons able to speak Irish at 49.0 percent, followed by Clare (45.9 percent), Cork County (44.9 percent) and Mayo (43.9 percent).</p>
