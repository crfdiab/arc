<h2 id=who-marries-orsino-at-the-end-of-twelfth-night>Who marries Orsino at the end of Twelfth Night?</h2>
<p>Viola<br>
Orsino is in love with the Countess Olivia, and sends Viola to court her for him, but Olivia falls for Viola instead. Sebastian arrives, causing a flood of mistaken identity, and marries Olivia. Viola then reveals she is a girl and marries Orsino.</p>
<h2 id=who-does-olivia-get-marry-to-in-twelfth-night>Who does Olivia get marry to in Twelfth Night?</h2>
<p>Olivia attempts to woo the young Cesario/Viola and repeatedly asks/lures him to come back to her estate by using various tricks and problems. Olivia eventually comes to the conclusion that she must marry him. However, in a case of mistaken identity, she marries Viola’s twin brother, Sebastian.</p>
<h2 id=who-all-gets-married-in-twelfth-night>Who all gets married in Twelfth Night?</h2>
<p>In the comedy Twelfth Night we can find as well as in the two previous plays that we are analising, this multiple happy endings as a result of the numerous couples produced. Olivia and Sebastian, Orsino and Viola and Sir Toby and Maria finally end up marrying.</p>
<h2 id=does-orsino-want-to-marry-olivia>Does Orsino want to marry Olivia?</h2>
<p>Orsino relates to Viola in a way that he never has to Olivia, diminishing his self-involvement and making him more likable. Yet he persists in his belief that he is in love with Olivia until the final scene, in spite of the fact that he never once speaks to her during the course of the play.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-lady-olivia-refuse-the-dukes-offer-for-marriage>Why did Lady Olivia refuse the Duke’s offer for marriage?</h2>
<p>In the kingdom of Illyria, a nobleman named Orsino lies around listening to music, pining away for the love of Lady Olivia. He cannot have her because she is in mourning for her dead brother and refuses to entertain any proposals of marriage.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-orsino-fall-in-love-with-olivia>Why did Orsino fall in love with Olivia?</h2>
<p>On Love. Orsino, Duke of Illyria, is in love with Olivia, a countess. His attendant brings word that Olivia has decided to veil her face for seven years, because she grieves the death of her beloved brother. Orsino wishes she would direct this love at him.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-maria-not-like-malvolio>Why does Maria not like Malvolio?</h2>
<p>Maria dislikes Malvolio for his pompous attitude. Because of his supervisor-level status as Olivia ‘s steward, he bosses the other servants around and believes he is better than them. He also acts like a “puritan,” which means that he disapproves of drinking and other forms of merrymaking.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-malvolio-punished-so-cruelly>Why is Malvolio punished so cruelly?</h2>
<p>With this stratification, Shakespeare allocates Malvolio’s vices of pride, usurping the social order, and dour temperament as the worst of character flaws, and that is why Malvolio receives the harshest punishment. Since she is Malvolio’s Lady, her harsh criticism of him is completely acceptable.</p>
<h2 id=does-maria-like-malvolio>Does Maria like Malvolio?</h2>
<p>Maria is shown to have a friendly relationship with Sir Toby Belch, and exhibits a witty attitude. Maria also forges a love letter to Malvolio which results in Malvolio being confined to a dark room (a treatment for madness).</p>
<h2 id=who-is-orsino-at-the-end-of-twelfth-night>Who is Orsino at the end of Twelfth Night?</h2>
<p>At the end of the play, when the confusion over the identities of Viola and her twin Sebastian is resolved, and Orsino comes to know Viola’s true identity, he agrees to take Viola as his wife. Orsino, as seen in the play, is a very passionate man.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-olivia-married-to-in-twelfth-night>Who is Olivia married to in Twelfth Night?</h2>
<p>Who does Olivia marry in Twelfth Night? In Twelfth Night, Olivia gets married to Sebastian. The noblewoman of Illyria, Olivia, in the play’s beginning is in mourning after her brother’s.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-viola-married-to-in-twelfth-night>Who is Viola married to in Twelfth Night?</h2>
<p>Viola on the other hand ends up marrying Sebastian – a look a like substitute for Cesario. On the other hand, Comedies revolving around love stories are known to be end with marriages – and so the extent of the criticism may be limited as the end result of the marriages could have also been a classic way to end the comedy.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-orsino-and-olivia-the-same-person>How are Orsino and Olivia the same person?</h2>
<p>The similarity between Orsino and Olivia does not diminish with the end of the play, since the audience realizes that by marrying Viola and Sebastian, respectively, Orsino and Olivia are essentially marrying female and male versions of the same person.
