<h2 id=why-is-it-the-black-sea>Why is it the Black Sea?</h2>
<p>Popular supposition derives “Black Sea” from the dark color of the water or climatic conditions. Rather, it referred to a system of color symbolism representing the cardinal directions, with black or dark for north, red for south, white for west, and green or light blue for east. Hence “Black Sea” meant “Northern Sea”.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-black-sea-clean>Is the Black Sea clean?</h2>
<p>With a clean freshwater surface, swimming in the Black Sea is possible; though offer a different experience from other water bodies. With its strange features, including the high level of minerals and salt, normally the objects tend to float on the water.</p>
<h2 id=how-the-black-sea-was-formed>How the Black Sea was formed?</h2>
<p>The Black Sea was once a freshwater lake, well below sea level. About 7,000 years ago, according to geological evidence, the rising Mediterranean sea pushed a channel through what is now the Bosphorus, and then seawater poured in at about 200 times the volume of Niagara Falls.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-sea-black-in-the-winter>Why is the Sea Black in the winter?</h2>
<p>Metal objects from ships, dead plants, and animal matter that sunk deeper than 150 meters for a long period of time became covered with a black sludge due to the high concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the sea. From the perspective of sailors, the sea was black due to severe storms in the winter, during which the water is so dark it looks black.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-black-mean-in-the-black-sea>What does black mean in the Black Sea?</h2>
<p>Black or dark represents the North, red the South, white is West and green or light blue for East. This symbolism pertaining to cardinal points was used during Herodotus’ time. Ancient records found today also supports this data.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-black-sea-have-a-meromictic-basin>Why does the Black Sea have a meromictic basin?</h2>
<p>The upper layers of water in the Black Sea do not mix with the lower waters, i.e., it has a meromictic basin. In fact, the Black Sea is the world’s largest water body with a meromictic basin. Due to this phenomenon over 90% of the water is anoxic (lacking in dissolved oxygen).</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-black-sea-in-meters>How big is the Black Sea in meters?</h2>
<p>The Black Sea has a depth of over 150 meters, and its waters are filled with hydrogen sulfide for almost two kilometers.</p>
