<h2 id=what-kind-of-farming-mostly-takes-place-in-western-europe>What kind of farming mostly takes place in Western Europe?</h2>
<p>Look back to Figure 1 on page 94 and notice that the dominant type of farming in Europe is ‘mostly arable with some animals’. Another term for this type of farming is mixed farming.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-main-agricultural-products-in-western-europe>What are the two main agricultural products in Western Europe?</h2>
<p>EU agricultural production is dominated by livestock products (including dairy), grains, vegetables, wine, fruits, and sugar. Major export commodities include grains (wheat and barley), dairy products, poultry, pork, fruit, vegetables, olive oil, and wine.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-cows-in-europe>Are there cows in Europe?</h2>
<p>The European herd 5th largest cattle population in the world in 2016, the EU has 89 million head, with 5 countries (France, Germany, the UK, Ireland and Italy) accounting for more than 60% (Figure 2). EU cattle has decreased by 6% since 200 due to the decapitalization in the dairy herd.</p>

<h2 id=which-is-the-main-type-of-livestock-in-the-eu>Which is the main type of livestock in the EU?</h2>
<p>Almost half of the livestock population in the EU in 2016, measured in livestock units, consisted of cattle. In 2016, cattle was the main type of livestock (in LSU) in 23 of the Member States, making up half or more in 14 countries. In particular, cattle dominated in Luxembourg (83.9 %) and Ireland (82.4 %).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-live-in-western-countries>What kind of animals live in Western countries?</h2>
<p>In Western countries the category encompasses primarily cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, horses, donkeys, and mules; other animals, such as buffalo, oxen, llamas, or camels, may predominate in the agriculture of other areas. A brief treatment of livestock follows.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-livestock-farming-so-important-in-europe>Why is livestock farming so important in Europe?</h2>
<p>Livestock farming is a key element for the vitality of many European territories. The livestock sector in Europe has to overcome difficulties and maintaining sufficient farmer incomes and economic viability of holdings must be guaranteed.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-live-in-southern-europe>What kind of animals live in southern Europe?</h2>
<p>The Camargue Horses and Alpine Long-Eared Bats of southern and western Europe. The Wild Boar and Raccoon Dogs of North-Central Europe. No matter where one goes in the continent that has served as the historical seat of Western Civilization, a unique set of diverse animals is sure to be found nearby.</p>
