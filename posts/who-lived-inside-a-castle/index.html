<h2 id=who-lived-inside-a-castle>Who lived inside a castle?</h2>
<p>The most important person in a castle was the owner —the king, lord, knight or lady. But they didn’t live there all the time. Kings of England owned dozens of castles, and could never have visited them all.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-live-in-medieval-castles>How did people live in medieval castles?</h2>
<p>1. Not many people lived there for much of the time. While castles were homes, they weren’t permanent residences – the lord, lady and household moved from castle to castle and took their things with them – beds, linen, tableware, tapestries, candlesticks, chests and perhaps even plants in pots!</p>
<h2 id=did-medieval-nobles-live-in-castles>Did medieval nobles live in castles?</h2>
<p>The nobles of the Middle Ages were fierce and proud people. The chief business of the nobles was war, and their amusements were warlike games and hunting. They lived in great fortified buildings called castles, generally set on some steep hill so that the enemy could not easily reach them.</p>
<h2 id=do-people-still-live-in-medieval-castles>Do people still live in medieval castles?</h2>
<p>Some are lucky enough to live in them with their families, as some castles have been perfectly looked after over centuries and have been passed on from generation to generation. …</p>
<h2 id=did-castles-have-toilets>Did castles have toilets?</h2>
<p>The toilets of a castle were usually built into the walls so that they projected out on corbels and any waste fell below and into the castle moat. Even better, waste went directly into a river as is the case of the latrines of one of the large stone halls at Chepstow Castle in Wales, built from the 11th century CE.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-medieval-kings-live>Where did medieval kings live?</h2>
<p>castles<br>
Medieval kings lived in castles. A medieval castle was a fortified home for a king or wealthy landowner.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-they-poop-on-old-ships>Where did they poop on old ships?</h2>
<p>Design. In sailing ships, the toilet was placed in the bow somewhat above the water line with vents or slots cut near the floor level allowing normal wave action to wash out the facility. Only the captain had a private toilet near his quarters, at the stern of the ship in the quarter gallery.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-people-who-lived-in-medieval-castles>Who are the people who lived in medieval castles?</h2>
<p>Regarding this, who lived in the medieval castles? During the late Middle Ages, from the 10th to the 16th centuries, kings and lords lived in castles. As well as the lord, the lady (his wife), and their family there were lots of staff. Some were important officials, such as the constable who took care of the castle when the lord was away.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-lords-of-the-castle-live>Where did the Lords of the castle live?</h2>
<p>The servants slept in the castle, too, but the farming peasants who grew food for the castle’s inhabitants lived in cottages on the lord’s estate, or manor. History › Castles › Who lived in castles?</p>
