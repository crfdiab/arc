Ostia was a port of republican Rome and a commercial centre under the empire (after 27 bce). The Romans considered Ostia their first colony and attributed its founding (for the purpose of salt production) to their fourth king, Ancus Marcius (7th century bce).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-port-of-ancient-rome>What was the port of ancient Rome?</h2>
<p>Ostia<br>
At the mouth of the River Tiber, Ostia was Rome’s seaport, but due to silting the site now lies 3 kilometres (2 miles) from the sea. The site is noted for the excellent preservation of its ancient buildings, magnificent frescoes and impressive mosaics.</p>

<h2 id=what-are-ostia>What are Ostia?</h2>

<h2 id=what-did-the-romans-call-the-southern-part-of-italy>What did the Romans call the southern part of Italy?</h2>
