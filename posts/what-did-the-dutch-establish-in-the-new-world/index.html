<h2 id=what-did-the-dutch-establish-in-the-new-world>What did the Dutch establish in the new world?</h2>
<p>Although the Netherlands only controlled the Hudson River Valley from 1609 until 1664, in that short time, Dutch entrepreneurs established New Netherland, a series of trading posts, towns, and forts up and down the Hudson River that laid the groundwork for towns that still exist today.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-dutch-claim-land-in-the-new-world>Where did the Dutch claim land in the New World?</h2>
<p>Based on his voyage, however, the Dutch claimed parts of present-day New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Delaware for the colony of New Netherland. Hudson, meanwhile, died in 1611 following a mutiny in which he was set adrift on a small lifeboat in the Canadian Arctic.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-dutch-come-to-the-new-world>When did the Dutch come to the New World?</h2>
<p>The Dutch first arrived in America in 1609 when the Dutch East India Company vessel De Halve Maen, commanded by the English captain, Henry Hudson, laid anchor at Sandy Hook, before sailing up what is now known as the Hudson River. In 1614 Dutch merchants established a trading post at Fort Orange.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-dutch-establish-a-settlement>Where did the Dutch establish a settlement?</h2>
<p>The Dutch established a settlement at Masulipatnam in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-dutch-come-to-new-netherland>Why did the Dutch come to New Netherland?</h2>
<p>In 1621, the Dutch government chartered the West India Company with the goal both of bringing order to economic activity in New Netherland and of challenging Spanish influence in the New World. Colonists arrived in New Netherland from all over Europe. Many fled religious persecution, war, or natural disaster.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-new-amsterdam-colony-get-its-name>How did the New Amsterdam colony get its name?</h2>
<p>A successful Dutch settlement in the colony grew up on the southern tip of Manhattan Island and was christened New Amsterdam. To legitimatize Dutch claims to New Amsterdam, Dutch governor Peter Minuit formally purchased Manhattan from the local tribe from which it derives it name in 1626.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-french-and-dutch-explore-the-new-world>When did the French and Dutch explore the New World?</h2>
<p>French and Dutch exploration in the New World. French, Dutch, and English explorers began to make inroads into the Americans in the late 1500s and early 1600s.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-province-of-new-netherland-called>What was the province of New Netherland called?</h2>
<p>the Province of New Netherland Although most Americans are familiar with the basic outline of the British colonization of America, and even know some information on the Spanish and French settlements, their is less familiarity with the history and geography of another new word settler, namely the Dutch.</p>
