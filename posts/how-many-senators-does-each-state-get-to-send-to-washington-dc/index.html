<h2 id=how-many-senators-does-each-state-get-to-send-to-washington-dc>How many senators does each state get to send to Washington DC?</h2>
<p>How many members of Congress come from each state? Each state sends two Senators to represent their state in the U.S. Senate. However, in the House of Representatives, a state’s representation is based on its population.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-senators-does-each-state-send>How many senators does each state send?</h2>
<p>According to Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution, “The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state, chosen by the legislature thereof for six Years.” The framers believed that in electing senators, state legislatures would cement their ties with the national government.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-representatives-does-washington-dchave>How many representatives does Washington d.c.have?</h2>
<p>Two other states have just a few more residents than the district, Alaska with 737,000 people and North Dakota with 760,000. But those four states each have one representative in the U.S. House and two senators. Washington, D.C. has neither a representative nor any senators.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-states-are-represented-in-the-senate>How many states are represented in the Senate?</h2>
<p>The Senate is the house of the bicameral United States Congress that has an unchanging proportion of representation allotted to each U.S. state. As there are currently 50 states as of 2014, there are 100 Senators, two for each state, serving in the Senate.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-senators-elected-in-the-united-states>How are senators elected in the United States?</h2>
<p>Senators are elected by the state as a whole, yet another contrast from the House of Representatives, in which representatives are elected by a limited district within the state, with one Representative assigned to each district.

<h2 id=how-many-states-are-in-washington-dc>How many states are in Washington D.C.?</h2>
<p>D.C. is bordered by 2 states, Virginia and Maryland. Virginia borders D.C. to the Southwest and Maryland to the Southeast, Northeast, and Northwest. The Potomac runs through Washington D.C. an Virginia to the West and Southwest separating the Pentagon in Virginia and the Lincoln Memorial. Does Washington D.C. have a capital?</p>
