<h2 id=does-competition-decrease-population-size>Does competition decrease population size?</h2>
<p>Competition can be a powerful force affecting the growth, distribution, and abundance of populations in nature. In the short run, competition should cause a reduction in the number of species living within an area, preventing very similar species from co-occurring.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-competition-affect-the-size-of-a-population-in-an-ecosystem>How does competition affect the size of a population in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Competition​ for resources among members of two or more different species (interspecific competition) also affects population size. This principle states that if two species are competing for the same resource, the species with a more rapid growth rate will outcompete the other.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-competition-and-population-size-quizlet>What is the relationship between competition and population size quizlet?</h2>
<p>Competition between individuals increases as population size increases.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-competition-limit-the-size-of-a-population>How can competition limit the size of a population?</h2>
<p>Limiting factors are resources or other factors in the environment that can lower the population growth rate. Competition for resources like food and space cause the growth rate to stop increasing, so the population levels off. This flat upper line on a growth curve is the carrying capacity.</p>
<h2 id=what-occurs-as-a-population-size-increases>What occurs as a population size increases?</h2>
<p>The carrying capacity of a particular environment is the maximum population size that it can support. As population size increases and resources become more limited, intraspecific competition occurs: individuals within a population who are more or less better adapted for the environment compete for survival.</p>
<h2 id=what-change-would-cause-an-increase-in-the-size-of-a-population>What change would cause an increase in the size of a population?</h2>
<p>The two factors that increase the size of a population are natality, which is the number of individuals that are added to the population over a period of time due to reproduction, and immigration, which is the migration of an individual into a place.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-carrying-capacity-of-a-population>What happens to the carrying capacity of a population?</h2>
<p>Carrying Capacity As a population’s size increases, the demand for resources, such as food, water, shelter, and space also increases. Eventually, there will not be enough resources for each individual.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-resources-as-the-population-increases>What happens to resources as the population increases?</h2>
<p>As a population’s size increases, the demand for resources, such as food, water, shelter, and space also increases. Eventually, there will not be enough resources for each individual.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-result-of-the-population-dynamics-of-competition>Which is a result of the population dynamics of competition?</h2>
<p>Competition describes a situation in which populations of two species utilize a resource that is in short supply. The Lotka-Volterra models of the population dynamics of competition show that there are two possible results: either the two competing species are able to coexist , or one species drives the other to extinction.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-individuals-become-crowded-as-a-population-grows>Why do individuals become crowded as a population grows?</h2>
<p>This occurs because individuals become crowded as a population grows. Since individuals within a population require the same resources, crowding causes resources to become more limited. Some individuals (typically small juveniles) eventually do not acquire enough resources and die or do not reproduce.</p>
