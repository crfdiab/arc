<p>religious freedom<br>
William Penn was an English Quaker leader and advocate of religious freedom who oversaw the founding of Pennsylvania as a refuge for Quakers and other religious minorities of Europe.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-william-penn-earn-respect-of-the-native-americans>How did William Penn earn respect of the Native Americans?</h2>
<p>William Penn earned the respect of Native Americans through his peaceful interactions with them. He would travel to Native American land and become friends with them. He had the most interaction with the Delaware Indians, also known as the Lenni Lenape, and he paid about 1200 pounds for their land.</p>
<h2 id=who-did-william-penn-make-a-treaty-with>Who did William Penn make a treaty with?</h2>
<p>Benjamin West, “Penn’s Treaty with the Indians” (1771-72) | PAFA – Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-the-pennsylvania-colony-and-the-native-americans>What was the relationship between the Pennsylvania colony and the Native Americans?</h2>
<p>By the 1790s, Native Americans and Pennsylvania’s European peoples were permanently estranged from each other, and no Indian nations retained secure possession of homelands within the state’s borders. By 1754, European colonization had substantially altered the location and number of Native Americans in Pennsylvania.</p>
<h2 id=which-american-colonies-had-religious-freedom>Which American colonies had religious freedom?</h2>
<p>Rhode Island became the first colony with no established church and the first to grant religious freedom to everyone, including Quakers and Jews.</p>
<h2 id=what-tribe-did-william-penn-sign-a-peace-treaty-with>What tribe did William Penn sign a peace treaty with?</h2>
<p>Penn Treaty Park, named for the traditional story of William Penn’s peaceful treaty with the Lenni Lenape Indians, is found at 1341 N. Delaware Avenue in Philadelphia’s Fishtown section, about 1½ miles upriver from Penn’s Landing on the Delaware River.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-penns-treaty-with-the-indians-take-place>Where did Penn’s Treaty with the Indians take place?</h2>
<p>Benjamin West’s Penn’s Treaty with the Indians illustrates a scene in which the Quaker leader William Penn is trading peacefully with leaders of the Lenni Lenape and Delaware peoples. It is a recounting of a popular belief that in 1682, Penn met with the Lenni Lenape and Delaware peoples under an elm tree at Shackamaxon and traded gifts for land.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-william-penn-important-to-the-american-colonies>Why was William Penn important to the American colonies?</h2>
<p>Penn welcomed settlers from all faiths to Pennsylvania. Each of the other American colonies had established an official church, but Penn did not. He sought out religious groups suffering in Europe, and invited them to his colony. He even gave some groups land. Yet religious tolerance did not mean that colonists of all faiths had equal rights.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-william-penn-sign-the-treaty-of-shackamaxon>Where did William Penn sign the Treaty of Shackamaxon?</h2>
<p>The painting depicts William Penn entering into the Treaty of Shackamaxon in 1683 with Tamanend, a chief of the Lenape (“Delaware Indians”) Turtle Clan, under the shade of an elm tree near the village of Shackamaxon (now Kensington) in Pennsylvania.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-treaty-between-william-penn-and-the-lenape>What was the treaty between William Penn and the Lenape?</h2>
<p>The peace between the Lenape Turtle Clan and Penn’s successors would endure for over 70 years, until the Penn’s Creek Massacre of 1755. The treaty William Penn entered into was remarked upon by Voltaire, who called it “… the only treaty never sworn to and never broken.”.</p>
