<h2 id=did-mexico-resent-the-annexation-of-texas>Did Mexico resent the annexation of Texas?</h2>
<p>Answer: A – Began the Mexican war. Mexico resented the annexation of Texas and consequently began the Mexican war when Texas was admitted to the union. The Republic of Texas was still considered as the Northern province for the Mexicans even though it had succeeded in breaking away from Mexico a decade earlier.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-mexican-americans-do-after-the-war>What did Mexican Americans do after the war?</h2>
<p>With the rising number of Mexicans coming to the United States in the 1920s after the war, many Mexicans living in the United States were left jobless and unemployed. The Mexicans who immigrated to the United States obtained jobs due to the high demand for supplies in the war, but when the war ended, they were let go.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-mexico-during-the-mexican-american-war>Who was the leader of Mexico during the Mexican American War?</h2>
<p>President Vicente Guerrero, a hero of Mexican independence, moved to gain more control over Texas and its influx of non-Hispanic colonists from the southern U.S. and discourage further immigration by abolishing slavery in Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-gold-found-in-the-mexican-american-war>Where was the gold found in the Mexican American War?</h2>
<p>Gold was discovered in California just days before Mexico ceded the land to the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Nonetheless, annexation procedures were quickly initiated after the 1844 election of Polk, who campaigned that Texas should be “re-annexed” and that the Oregon Territory should be “re-occupied.”</p>
<h2 id=how-many-us-soldiers-were-killed-in-the-mexican-american-war>How many US soldiers were killed in the Mexican American War?</h2>
<p>In 1846, after Polk ordered General Taylor’s troops into the disputed territory, Mexican forces attacked an American Army outpost (“Thornton Affair”) in the occupied territory, killing 12 U.S. soldiers and capturing 52. These same Mexican troops later laid siege to an American fort along the Rio Grande.</p>
