<p>Andromeda Galaxy<br>
All the individual stars we see in the night sky are in our galaxy – the Milky Way. The absolute farthest object we can see with our naked eye is outside of our galaxy: the Andromeda Galaxy, located 2.5 million light years from us, or a cool 23 quintillion miles.</p>
<h2 id=can-the-human-eye-see-forever>Can the human eye see forever?</h2>
<p>The answer is no, there is no stopping point for sight. Only the distance at which light becomes too spread or dissolved to be observed or noticed by your eye. You could say that if your eye were much more perceptive to light, you could make out stars that are currently of borderline distinguishable brightness to you.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-can-you-see-a-face>How far can you see a face?</h2>
<p>At about 150 feet, accurate face identification for people with normal vision drops to zero. The study used well-known celebrities in experiments, which helped determine whether knowing the subject aides visual identification at these distances.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-in-the-sky-can-the-human-eye-see>How far in the sky can the human eye see?</h2>
<p>The human eye can see an almost unlimited distance. Looking up into the sky on a very clear night, the Triangulum Galaxy can sometimes be seen. This is a distance of 3.14 million light years.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-can-someone-see>How far can someone see?</h2>
<p>The Earth curves about 8 inches per mile. As a result, on a flat surface with your eyes 5 feet or so off the ground, the farthest edge that you can see is about 3 miles away.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-away-can-a-human-see-another-human>How far away can a human see another human?</h2>
<p>Seeing distances Based on the curve of the Earth: Standing on a flat surface with your eyes about 5 feet off the ground, the farthest edge that you can see is about 3 miles away.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-you-can-see-in-front-of-you>How far you can see in front of you?</h2>
<p>Based on the curve of the Earth: Standing on a flat surface with your eyes about 5 feet off the ground, the farthest edge that you can see is about 3 miles away.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-can-light-be-seen>How far can light be seen?</h2>
<p>By comparing the candle flame to a magnitude-six star, the researchers discovered that you would need 7 × 50 binoculars to see a candle 10 miles away. Furthermore, the farthest from which an average unaided human could see a candle is about 1.6 miles.</p>
<h2 id=what-animal-can-see-the-farthest>What animal can see the farthest?</h2>
<p>Eagles. All birds of prey have excellent long-distance vision, but eagles stand out. They can see clearly about eight times as far as humans can, allowing them to spot and focus in on a rabbit or other animal at a distance of about two miles.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-human-eye-see-30-miles-away>Can a human eye see 30 miles away?</h2>
<p>Considering the absolute threshold, the brightness of a candle flame, and the way a glowing object dims according to the square of the distance away from it, vision scientists conclude that one could make out the faint glimmer of a candle flame up to 30 miles away. But how far away can we perceive…</p>
<h2 id=how-far-can-people-see-on-a-clear-day>How far can people see on a clear day?</h2>
<p>On a clear day, you can see for miles and miles and miles. The old saying turns out to be just about true. For a six-foot tall person, the horizon is a little more than 3 miles (5 km) away.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-miles-away-can-you-see-in-the-air>How many miles away can you see in the air?</h2>
<p>Pan American clipper pilots have found that most of their passengers have surprisingly hazy notions of how far they can see in the air. One passenger, 20,000 feet above Brazil, insisted that she could see the coast of Africa, 1,822 miles away.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-miles-can-you-see-at-10-000-feet>How many miles can you see at 10, 000 feet?</h2>
<p>The formula for determining how many miles an individual can see at higher levels is the square root of his altitude times 1.225. Thus on a clear day at 1,000 feet a person with normal vision can see 39 miles; at 10,000 feet, 123 miles; at 25,000 feet, 194 miles.</p>
