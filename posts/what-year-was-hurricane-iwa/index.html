Hurricane Iwa/Dates</p>

<p>November 19- 25, 1982<br>
Hurricane Iwa of November 19- 25, 1982 in the Hawaiian Islands. Weather-related disasters that can adversely impact the Hawaiian Islands include hurricanes and their associated surge flooding. The 1982 Hurricane Iwa was one of the most significant hurricanes of the 20th Century to impact the Hawaiian Islands.</p>

Hurricane Iniki/Affected areas</p>
<h2 id=do-hurricanes-ever-hit-hawaii>Do hurricanes ever hit Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Hawaii lies in the central Pacific, where about four or five tropical cyclones appear each year, although as many as fifteen have occurred, such as in the 2015 season; rarely do these storms actually affect Hawaii. Earlier windstorms that struck Hawaii were not labeled as hurricanes.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hurricane-iwa-develop-into-a-hurricane>When did Hurricane Iwa develop into a hurricane?</h2>
<p>It developed from an active trough of low pressure near the equator on November 19. The storm moved erratically northward until becoming a hurricane on November 23 when it began accelerating to the northeast in response to strong upper-level flow from the north.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-trough-of-low-pressure-located-during-hurricane-iwa>Where was the trough of low pressure located during Hurricane Iwa?</h2>
<p>One person was killed from the high seas, and three deaths were indirectly related to the hurricane’s aftermath. A very active trough of low pressure persisted along the equator in the middle of November, with westerly surface winds and windspread convection located along the trough from 140° W to 140° E.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-eye-of-hurricane-iwa-located>Where was the eye of Hurricane Iwa located?</h2>
<p>Its central pressure is not known. The following day, November 24, the eye of hurricane passed approximately 25 miles north of the northwestern coast of Kauai. However its radius of maximum winds was right over the island., causing maximum destruction. Iwa continued in a northeastward direction losing energy and intensity.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hurricane-iwa-hit-hilo-hawaii>When did Hurricane Iwa hit Hilo, Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Early in the day on November 19, it had organized into a tropical storm but later that same day – as it moved over warmer waters (partially because it was an El Nino year) – it gained strength and reached Category 1 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS). At that time it was about 500 miles southwest of Hilo, Hawaii.</p>
