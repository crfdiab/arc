<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-to-build-a-stone-keep-castle>How long did it take to build a stone keep castle?</h2>
<p>Stone castles were extremely expensive and took a great deal of time to build.

<h2 id=how-tall-was-the-man-who-built-the-coral-castle>How tall was the man who built the Coral Castle?</h2>
<p>He was a Latvian immigrant named Edward Leedskalnin who stood, it is said, 5 feet tall (1.5 meters) and weighed 100 lbs. (45 kilograms). Legend has it that he was inspired to build the structure after being abandoned by his 16-year-old sweetheart on what was to be their wedding day.</p>
