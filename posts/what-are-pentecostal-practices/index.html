<h2 id=what-are-pentecostal-practices>What are Pentecostal practices?</h2>
<p>Pentecostalism is a form of Christianity that emphasises the work of the Holy Spirit and the direct experience of the presence of God by the believer. Pentecostals believe that faith must be powerfully experiential, and not something found merely through ritual or thinking. Pentecostalism is energetic and dynamic.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-pentecostals-worship>How do Pentecostals worship?</h2>
<p>Besides the gift of tongues, Pentecostals may also use glossolalia as a form of praise and worship in corporate settings. Pentecostals in a church service may pray aloud in tongues while others pray simultaneously in the common language of the gathered Christians.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-structure-of-the-pentecostal-church>What is the structure of the Pentecostal church?</h2>
<p>The structure of the International Pentecostal Church of Christ is a blend of Congregational and the Presbyterian systems and they operate under their own structures. They elect their own pastors and are overseen by various boards from the body.</p>
<h2 id=why-cant-pentecostals-wear-pants>Why can’t Pentecostals wear pants?</h2>
<p>Dress Rules for Women “The exposed body tends to arouse improper thoughts in both wearer and onlooker.” To avoid such problems, United Pentecostal churches set these modesty guidelines for women: No slacks “because they immodestly reveal the feminine contours of upper leg, thigh, and hip” No makeup.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-head-of-the-pentecostal-church>Who is head of the Pentecostal church?</h2>
<p>General Bishop<br>
The church is led by a General Bishop (formerly called General Superintendent and before that General Moderator and General Chairman) and a General Convention which meets biennially.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rituals-do-pentecostals-believe-in>What kind of rituals do Pentecostals believe in?</h2>
<p>Pentecostals share a belief in the restoration of gifts of the Holy Spirit, including healing, prophecy and speaking in tongues, which emphasize a believers’ personal experiences with God’s presence. As a result, there is less ritualism in Pentecostalism than is found in most Christian denominations.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-pentecostal-churches>What are the different types of Pentecostal churches?</h2>
<p>There are “Classical Pentecostals,” who came out of the first revival in the early 1900s; “Charismatics,” who arose in the 1960s; and Neo-Charismatics, which is considered the third wave of the growth of Pentecostalism. Many denominations share similar beliefs, but differ on other issues.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-united-pentecostal-church-of-christ-worship>How does the United Pentecostal Church of Christ worship?</h2>
<p>United Pentecostals observe the Lord’s Supper in their worship service, along with foot washing . Worship Service – UPCI services are spirit-filled and lively, with members shouting, singing, raising their hands in praise, clapping, dancing, testifying, and speaking in tongues.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-pentecostal-church-believe-in-speaking-in-tongues>How does the Pentecostal Church believe in speaking in tongues?</h2>
<p>The church believes in the gift of speaking in tongues, both glossolalia (speech in an unknown language) and xenoglossy (speech in a language known but not to speaker). A Pew Research Center study found that globally, most countries with Pentecostalism say their church services include speaking in tongues, prophecy and divine healing.</p>
