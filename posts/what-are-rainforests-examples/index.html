<p>The largest rainforests on Earth surround the Amazon River in South America and the Congo River in Africa. The tropical islands of Southeast Asia and parts of Australia support dense rainforest habitats. Even the cool evergreen forests of North America’s Pacific Northwest and Northern Europe are a type of rainforest.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-examples-of-competition-in-the-rainforest>What are some examples of competition in the rainforest?</h2>
<p>Rainforest Competition In the rainforest, many of the big cats such as tigers, jaguars and leopards all compete for food that includes small mammals, rodents, wart hogs, antelopes and monkeys.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-types-of-rainforest-and-give-an-example-of-each>What are the two types of rainforest and give an example of each?</h2>
<p>There are two types of rainforests, tropical and temperate. Tropical rainforests are found closer to the equator where it is warm. Temperate rainforests are found near the cooler coastal areas further north or south of the equator. The tropical rainforest is a hot, moist biome where it rains all year long.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-example-of-competition-in-the-tropical-rainforest>What is an example of competition in the tropical rainforest?</h2>
<p>An example of competition in the tropical rainforest would be between all the plants under the canopy layer. The organisms under the tree canopy do not receive a lot of sunlight, so they have to compete with each other. The plants have learned to adapt (their short height) because of competition between plants.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-people-involved-in-the-tropical-rainforest>How are people involved in the tropical rainforest?</h2>
<p>Education to increase public awareness of the value of tropical rainforests. Local communities included and involved in forest conservation projects. Use of alternative timber sources such as rubber trees was encouraged.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-international-agreements-made-to-protect-tropical-rainforests>How are international agreements made to protect tropical rainforests?</h2>
<p>International agreements – agreements to protect tropical rainforests have been made between different countries through debt-for-nature swaps. This is when a country which is owed money by another country cancels part of the debt if an agreement is made by the debtor country to ensure the conservation of its tropical rainforests.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-tropical-rainforests-managed-to-prevent-deforestation>How are tropical rainforests managed to prevent deforestation?</h2>
<p>Tropical rainforests can be managed in the following ways to reduce deforestation: Logging and replanting – selective logging of mature trees ensures that the rainforest canopy is preserved. This method allows the forest to recover because the younger trees gain more space and sunlight to grow.</p>
