<h2 id=how-do-you-fix-too-much-salt>How do you fix too much salt?</h2>
<p>Stir in a tablespoon of something acidic Lemon juice, Dijon mustard, distilled white vinegar and other acidic ingredients add extra flavor, masking saltiness. (Think: fish and chips.) Start with just a dash, or else you might end up with dinner that’s too salty and too sour.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-fix-salty-ground-beef>How do you fix salty ground beef?</h2>
<p>Add vinegar or lemon – the acid cuts the salt flavor – and a dash of sugar or brown sugar to combat the excess salt. Use 1 tbsp. of whatever vinegar works best with the flavor of your dish, then taste and add more if necessary. Try red wine vinegar with a hearty roast or stew or rice vinegar with an Asian stir fry.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-fix-over-seasoned-meat>How do you fix over seasoned meat?</h2>
<p>Add more liquid (just make sure it’s unseasoned—aka, not an already seasoned broth). Or add more mix-ins, such as vegetable chunks or cooked rice. Or add both! You can also stir in a small amount of sweetener to taste.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-i-do-if-my-steak-is-too-salty>What do I do if my steak is too salty?</h2>
<p>Here are some of the steps you can try if your steak is too salty:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wash it off. When dealing with oversalted meat, water is going to be your most useful tool.</li>
<li>Soak it.</li>
<li>Braise it.</li>
<li>Make a cream sauce.</li>
<li>Add butter.</li>
<li>Add acid.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-do-you-fix-salty-rice>How do you fix salty rice?</h2>
<p>Here are the easiest ways to neutralize salt in food:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add Bulk. If the dish is very salty, make another batch (without adding salt) to double the original amount.</li>
<li>Add a Starch.</li>
<li>Add Some Greens.</li>
<li>Add Dairy.</li>
<li>Add A Protein.</li>
<li>Add Fat.</li>
<li>Rinse With Hot Water.</li>
<li>Add Sugar.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id=how-do-you-make-skirt-steak-less-salty>How do you make skirt steak less salty?</h2>
<p>Skirt steak is a very thin cut, so it absorbs more salt than a thicker cut. My butcher friend Joel suggested that I soak the skirt steak in cold water, for about an hour in the fridge before marinating. Change the water every 20 minutes. This works really well in reducing the saltiness.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-fix-meat-thats-too-salty>What’s the best way to fix meat that’s too salty?</h2>
<p>To fix over-salted meats, just give them a quick rinse under running water, and pat them dry with a paper towel when you’re done. You can also leach the salt out of salt pork or bacon that you find too salty by soaking it in water for at least two hours before you serve it.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-bad-to-eat-meat-with-too-much-salt>Is it bad to eat meat with too much salt?</h2>
<p>Grilled meat on a chopping board and a glass of wine. Whether you add too much salt by accident or intent, salty meat is never a good thing. The sodium in salt can put your health at risk and the taste can ruin your meal.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-salt-out-of-meat>How long does it take to get salt out of meat?</h2>
<p>For less salty meat, 10 to 12 hours of soaking is probably enough to make the meat palatable, though it will still taste salty. Boiling the meat after soaking it will continue to remove salt. However, it makes sense that you should not add any salt to the water, stock or sauce that the meat is in as it cooks.</p>

<p>Instead, use one of the methods above to tame your overly seasoned dishes. With these tips, you’ll never have to sit through a mouth-shrivelingly salty dish again or *gasp* throw out a meal because you added too much salt.
