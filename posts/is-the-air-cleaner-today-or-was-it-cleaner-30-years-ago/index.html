<h2 id=is-the-air-cleaner-today-or-was-it-cleaner-30-years-ago>Is the air cleaner today or was it cleaner 30 years ago?</h2>
<p>In its first comprehensive analysis of the quality of the environment in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency said today that the nation’s air, water and land were cleaner and better protected than they were 30 years ago but that problems remained with impure waterways, polluted air and the …</p>
<h2 id=has-air-pollution-increased-or-decreased>Has air pollution increased or decreased?</h2>
<p>Since 2008, emissions have continued to decrease by 30 percent from 2008 to 2017. During the same time period, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants dropped by 73 percent. The graph also shows that between 1980 and 2019, CO2 emissions increased by 11 percent.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-air-cleaner-now-than-in-1970>Is the air cleaner now than in 1970?</h2>
<p>But despite almost a 60 percent increase in population since 1970, the nation’s air is cleaner, and the ways in which we light our rooms and power our automobiles have become far more efficient. …</p>
<h2 id=how-has-air-quality-changed-over-time>How has air quality changed over time?</h2>
<p>An analysis of Environmental Protection Agency data published this week by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that fine particulate pollution increased 5.5 percent on average across the country between 2016 and 2018, after decreasing nearly 25 percent over the previous seven years.</p>
<h2 id=what-has-the-clean-air-act-done>What has the Clean Air Act done?</h2>
<p>Experience with the Clean Air Act since 1970 has shown that protecting public health and building the economy can go hand in hand. Clean Air Act programs have lowered levels of six common pollutants — particles, ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide — as well as numerous toxic pollutants.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-air-in-the-united-states-getting-cleaner>Is the air in the United States getting cleaner?</h2>
<p>America’s air is getting cleaner, which doesn’t just mean a healthier public — it also saves the U.S. billions of dollars. The American Lung Association’s annual “State of the Air” report — based on EPA findings for 2009 through 2011 — found that the three types of air pollution they track have all declined.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-clean-air-act-first-passed>When was the Clean Air Act first passed?</h2>
<p>Wimmer credited the Clean Air Act, first passed in 1963 and expanded over the years, with reducing pollutant levels. The EPA’s latest proposal, set to kick in by 2017, will further purify engine exhaust by reducing sulfur content in gasoline.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-air-conditioners-have-to-be-before-they-need-to-be-replaced>How old do air conditioners have to be before they need to be replaced?</h2>
<p>Here’s what you need to know. Most of the air conditioners built today will last somewhere between 15 and 20 years before they’ll need to be replaced. Even if these systems are built with the best and highest-quality parts, something will come along in the next two decades that will render it inefficient.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-more-days-with-unhealthy-air-in-america>Are there more days with Unhealthy air in America?</h2>
<p>There were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, the four years when America had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980.</p>
