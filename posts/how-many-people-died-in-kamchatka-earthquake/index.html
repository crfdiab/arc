<h2 id=how-many-people-died-in-kamchatka-earthquake>How many people died in Kamchatka earthquake?</h2>
<p>The Kamchatka Tsunami was generated by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake on November 4, 1952, in East Russia. The local tsunami, which generated waves as high as 50 feet, caused extensive damage to the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Kuril Islands, and left an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people dead.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-kamchatka-earthquake-in-1952>What was the cause of the Kamchatka earthquake in 1952?</h2>
<p>Shallow subduction and accretion of seamounts is particularly evident in the forearc region of the Kronotskiy Peninsula – the Pacific promontory near which the Hawaii-Emperor seamount hotspot chain terminates. The November 4, 1952 earthquake occurred in this general area.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-major-earthquakes-took-place-in-kamchatka>How many major earthquakes took place in Kamchatka?</h2>
<p>Three earthquakes, which occurred off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula in far eastern Russia in 1737, 1923 and 1952, were megathrust earthquakes and caused tsunamis.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-the-assam-tibet-earthquake-last>How long did the Assam Tibet earthquake last?</h2>
<p>It was the 10th largest earthquake of the 20th century (USGS 2011). This earthquake was caused by the convergence of two continental plates of India and Eurasia. The earthquake shock lasted for a period ranging from 4 to 8 min within the severely affected area and it was felt throughout the Eastern India.</p>
<h2 id=are-earthquakes-common-in-assam>Are earthquakes common in Assam?</h2>
<p>Assam has been experiencing low to medium intensity earthquake almost daily since April this year leading to panic, fear and concern among people and experts in the seismically active region. The quake, measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale, occurred near Dhekiajuli in the Sonitpur district.</p>
<h2 id=is-assam-in-danger-of-earthquake>Is Assam in danger of earthquake?</h2>
<p>Assam’s vulnerability Earthquakes are not uncommon in Assam, with the National Centre for Seismology saying that the region has seen several moderate to high-intensity earthquakes. One of the worst among them was the great Assam-Tibet earthquake in 1950 which measured 8.6 magnitude on the Richter scale.</p>
<h2 id=can-we-predict-earthquake>Can we predict earthquake?</h2>
<p>No. Neither the USGS nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake. We do not know how, and we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future. USGS scientists can only calculate the probability that a significant earthquake will occur in a specific area within a certain number of years.</p>
