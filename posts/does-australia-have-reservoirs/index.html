<p>Dams and reservoirs in Australia is a link page for any dam or reservoir in Australia….Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<table><tr><th>Dam name (where appropriate)</th><td>Bendora Dam</td></tr><tr><th>Reservoir name (where appropriate)</th><td>Bendora Reservoir</td></tr><tr><th>Region(s)</th><td>Namadgi National Park</td></tr><tr><th>Purpose(s)</th><td>Water supply</td></tr><tr><th>Reservoir capacity</th><th>ML</th><td>11,540</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=are-reservoirs-used-for-drinking-water>Are reservoirs used for drinking water?</h2>
<p>Reservoirs provide flood control, irrigation, drinking water and recreation for millions of people worldwide.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-reservoirs-are-there-in-australia>How many reservoirs are there in Australia?</h2>
<p>Of the 224 Australian reservoirs, for which data were available, only one is listed as being used exclusively for flood control and two for recreation. For the RoW, the ICOLD data suggest that irrigation (27%) and hydroelectricity (25%) are the major single purpose reservoirs.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-water-stored-in-australia>How is water stored in Australia?</h2>
<p>Water for the area is stored in three major dams; Wivenhoe Dam on the Brisbane River, Somerset on the Stanley River and North Pine on the North Pine River. Water is also provided by a number of smaller dams that are connected via the SEQ Water Grid.</p>
<h2 id=is-australia-running-out-of-water>Is Australia running out of water?</h2>
<p>Over a dozen towns and cities in eastern Australia are fast approaching Day Zero — the day that the last of the drinking water runs dry. As global climate change intensifies, Australia has been hit hard by an unprecedented wave of droughts and water shortages, according to Agence France-Presse.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-reservoirs-in-south-australia-used>How are the reservoirs in South Australia used?</h2>
<p>Our reservoirs are the state’s primary water storage areas, supplying homes and businesses across South Australia. The reservoirs don’t just fill with rain, we can also use them as storage for River Murray water in times of high demand.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-dams-and-reservoirs-in-australia>Where are the dams and reservoirs in Australia?</h2>
<p>There are three key water storage facilities located in the Australian Capital Territory. The fourth source of water for Canberra, Googong Dam, is in NSW. In addition, there are four smaller man-made reservoirs used for recreation and as traps for sediment and fertilizers .</p>
<h2 id=how-much-groundwater-is-used-in-western-australia>How much groundwater is used in Western Australia?</h2>
<p>Including self-supplied water, groundwater now makes up more than 75% of the water consumed in Western Australia. 3 Reuse water made up 348 GL (almost 4%) of total water supplied by water providers in 2008–09; of this, 98% (341 GL) was supplied through water utilities and 30% (102 GL) was used by agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-water-reservoir-in-melbourne>Which is the largest water reservoir in Melbourne?</h2>
<p>The reservoirs are connected so we can move water around the water supply system, based on factors such as rainfall and demand. Did you know… Thomson Reservoir is the largest but most of Melbourne’s water is supplied via Silvan Reservoir?</p>
