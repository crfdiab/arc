<p>Because the soil was rocky and the climate was often harsh, colonists in New England only farmed enough to feed their families. Some of these crops included corn, beans, and squash. The New England colonies, however, were full of forests, giving the colonists the important natural resource of trees.</p>

<li>Pumpkins and Squash.</li>

<h2 id=what-foods-did-people-in-the-middle-colonies-eat>What foods did people in the Middle Colonies eat?</h2>
<p>New England’s main food was fish because they lived by the ocean. Farmers in the Middle colonies grew wheat, barley, oats, rye flax and corn. They were called the “breadbasket” because they grew the crops needed to make bread.</p>

<p>Other native crops included pumpkins, squash and beans. European wheat, barley, oats and peas were also grown. In addition to the large-field crops, family gardens in the colonies contained herbs and vegetables, such as lettuce, parsley, carrots, spinach and turnips.</p>
