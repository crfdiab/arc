<h2 id=what-does-inukshuk-symbolize>What does Inukshuk symbolize?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, they were used by the Inuit in the north as directional markers. An Inukshuk in the shape of a person signifies safety, hope and friendship. These stone sculptures were also important for navigation, as a point of reference, as a marker for hunting grounds, or to denote a food cache.</p>

<h2 id=how-do-you-get-inukshuk>How do you get inukshuk?</h2>
<p>How to build an Inukshuk:</p>

<li>Most Importantly.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=do-you-know-what-an-inukshuk-is>Do you know what an inukshuk is?</h2>
<p>An inukshuk is a structure made of stones piled on top of each other. Inuksuit, or inukshuks (more than one inukshuk) are used for navigation in the frozen north. Inukshuks are also used to mark sacred places. They can also work like signposts to make a good hunting or fishing spot.</p>
<h2 id=can-we-go-to-whistler-now>Can we go to Whistler now?</h2>
<p>Whistler is open and visitors are welcome! Fully vaccinated American travellers can visit Canada effective August 9, 2021, and fully vaccinated travellers from other international countries will be able to visit Canada effective September 7, 2021 (tentative).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-they-build-the-inukshuk-on-whistler-mountain>Why did they build the Inukshuk on Whistler Mountain?</h2>
<p>There are several theories about why inukshuks were created, but most likely it was used as a reference point and navigation marker for travel routes. The tall stone structure could be seen from far away to provide direction to people traveling long distances. The inukshuk has long roots in Inuit culture.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-inukshuk-on-black-tusk-mountain>Where is the Inukshuk on Black Tusk mountain?</h2>
<p>Chili created the iconic painting of a snow-covered Inukshuk overlooking Black Tusk mountain which now hangs in the dining area of the Roundhouse restaurant atop Whistler mountain but there are many more Inuksuit around in the valley and surrounding backcountry.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-word-inukshuk-mean-in-canada>What does the word Inukshuk mean in Canada?</h2>
<p>The word inukshuk can be translated to mean, “something which acts for or performs the function of a person.” The inukshuk has become an unofficial symbol of Canada, and it has also become a symbol of hope and friendship across the country.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-statue-in-whistler-bc-represent>What does the statue in Whistler BC represent?</h2>
<p>You can’t help but think that it’s watching over Whistler Blackcomb, and people often wonder what the statue represents. This iconic statue is the Whistler Mountain Inukshuk, created for Whistler as a symbol of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in British Columbia.</p>
