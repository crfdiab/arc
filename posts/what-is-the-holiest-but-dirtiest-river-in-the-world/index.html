<p>The Ganges is one India’s holiest and also most-polluted rivers. Millions live on its banks across several states. It’s widely considered as a lifeline for many Indians.</p>
<h2 id=what-state-has-the-dirtiest-river>What state has the dirtiest river?</h2>
<p>For the second time in three eyars, advocacy group Environment America ranked the Ohio River as the most polluted river in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-most-polluted-city-in-america>What’s the most polluted city in America?</h2>
<p>Once again, Bakersfield, California, was named the worst U.S. city for year-round particle pollution despite the fact that it managed to improve its levels of short-term PM2. 5. It was followed on the list of worst-performing cities by Fresno-Madera-Hanford and Visalia, both of which are also in California.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-dirtiest-river-in-the-world>Which is the dirtiest river in the world?</h2>
<p>Polluted with: Industrial waste along the Meycauayan River, tanneries and lead recycling facilities in Marilao, human waste and trash in Manila. The water contains high levels of lead, human sewage, and the carcinogen hexavalent chromium.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-polluted-river-in-the-world>Which is the most polluted river in the world?</h2>
<p>1. Citarum River, Indonesia – The Most Polluted River in the World. Important for: The largest and longest river in West Java, the Citarum provides 80% of the water for the 5 million people living in its basin, and is used for agriculture, water supply, fishery, industry, electricity, and sewerage.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-sarno-river-the-dirtiest-in-the-world>Why is the Sarno River the dirtiest in the world?</h2>
<p>Polluted with: Industrial and agricultural waste, resulting in a high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals. Why: While the Sarno is still used for transportation and fishing as it has been for millennia, but by the time it reaches lower elevations, it has accumulated a thick chemical scum on top.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-marilao-river-so-polluted>Why is the Marilao River so polluted?</h2>
<p>Tanneries, textile factories, gold refineries, municipal dumps, and recycling facilities all contribute to pollution in the river, into which people also dump human waste and household garbage. Parts of the Marilao River are so polluted that the water contains no oxygen and therefore cannot support aquatic life.</p>
