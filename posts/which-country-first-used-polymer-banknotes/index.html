<h2 id=which-country-first-used-polymer-banknotes>Which country first used polymer banknotes?</h2>
<p>In 1988, Australia was the first country to introduce polymer banknotes for circulation.</p>
<h2 id=who-invented-polymer-banknotes>Who invented polymer banknotes?</h2>
<p>David Solomon<br>
How do you make money? David Solomon is an Australian scientist who worked with the Reserve Bank to design our plastic banknotes. Working with $3 and $7 notes to avoid counterfeiting charges, he helped to design and test banknotes with synthetic sweat and fake wallets.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-polymer-banknote-released>When was the first polymer banknote released?</h2>
<p>It was not until some twenty years and an estimated expenditure of $20,000,000 that the first polymer banknote was produced as a commemorative $10 note In January 1988, to mark the bicentenary of Australia. This was the first banknote to be produced on polymer substrate, rather than on paper.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-polymer-banknote>What was the first polymer banknote?</h2>
<p>$10 commemorative<br>
The world’s first polymer banknote was the $10 commemorative note issued in January 1988 to commemorate the Australian Bicentenary. It was developed by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Commonwealth Scientific and Industreal Research Organisation (CSIRO), and The University of Melbourne.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-fake-polymer-notes>Are there fake polymer notes?</h2>
<p>There are simple ways to tell whether a paper or polymer banknote is real or fake. When the note is tilted from side to side, the hologram at the bottom should alternate the words “Five/Ten/Twenty/Fifty” and “Pounds”.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-polymer-banknotes-last>How long do polymer banknotes last?</h2>
<p>Since the issuance of NNS polymer banknotes, the median life has ranged widely across denominations – from 3.5 years for $5 banknotes up to 10 years for $50 banknotes – even though all Australian banknote denominations are produced with the same technology and have identical security features.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-fake-10-notes>Are there fake 10 notes?</h2>
<p>The polymer notes use holograms. On the ten pound, the hologram changes from ‘ten’ to ‘pounds’. There’s also the same 3D crown as the fiver – if you turn the note over, behind the crown is a book shaped copper foil with the initials JA.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-you-tell-a-fake-banknote>How can you tell a fake banknote?</h2>
<p>Run your finger across the paper note and if it’s genuine, you should be able to feel the raised print on areas such as the words ‘Bank of England’ on the front. If it’s a counterfeit, the note is unlikely to have a textured feel to it and will feel flat all over.</p>
<h2 id=are-polymer-banknotes-better-than-paper>Are polymer banknotes better than paper?</h2>
<p>Polymer notes last at least 2.5 times longer than paper notes, reducing replacement costs. Lower environmental impact because they last longer. Completely waterproof. Cleaner because they are resistant to dirt and moisture.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-you-tell-a-fake-10>How can you tell a fake 10?</h2>
<p>The security features are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hologram image at the bottom of the note will change from displaying the word ‘ten’ to the word ‘pounds’ when tilted from side to side.</li>
<li>The metallic image on the transparent window near the middle of the note should be gold on the front of the note and silver on the back.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-can-you-tell-fake-polymer-notes>How can you tell fake polymer notes?</h2>
<p>– Contact the police or take the note to your bank as a suspect counterfeit. On the front of the polymer notes (the side with raised print), the value can be identified by the number of clusters of raised dots in the top left corner.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-still-use-paper-20-notes>Can you still use paper 20 notes?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can continue to use paper £20 notes to make purchases at the moment. The old £20 notes will stay valid until the September 2022 expiry date given by the Bank of England. You can also exchange the paper notes for the new polymer ones directly at the Bank of England based in London.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-first-country-to-use-polymer-banknotes>Which is the first country to use polymer banknotes?</h2>
<p>PaySpace Magazine made a list of countries that have fully adopted polymer banknotes. Australia was one of the first countries to issue polymer notes, and the first country to adopt the trend. The first banknotes were issued in 1988. Nowadays all Australian dollar notes (denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100) are made of polymer.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-plastic-bank-note-made>Where was the first plastic bank note made?</h2>
<p>A history of plastic notes. Haiti and Cost Rica were the first to trial polymer banknotes in the 1980s, using American technology – but the ink smudged. A plastic note was introduced in the Isle of Man in 1983, using British technology, but withdrawn in 1988 – again because of problems with the ink.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-polymer-note-come-out>When did the first polymer note come out?</h2>
<p>But with recent technological developments, plastic film notes offer additional security features along with longevity and energy efficiency.­ Polymer banknotes were first issued in 1988 by Australia, which now uses polymer exclusively and is about to launch a new series of notes, starting with the $5 bill in September.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-new-zealand-start-issuing-polymer-money>When did New Zealand start issuing polymer money?</h2>
<p>New Zealand has issued the New Zealand dollar in polymer since 1999. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand launched a new issue of banknotes called «Brighter Money» in 2015. A five-dollar note was named the banknote of the year for 2015 among nearly 40 eligible designs from a record 20 countries.</p>
