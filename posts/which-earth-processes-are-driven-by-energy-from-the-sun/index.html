<h2 id=which-earth-processes-are-driven-by-energy-from-the-sun>Which Earth processes are driven by energy from the sun?</h2>
<p>The absorbed sunlight drives photosynthesis, fuels evaporation, melts snow and ice, and warms the Earth system. Solar power drives Earth’s climate. Energy from the Sun heats the surface, warms the atmosphere, and powers the ocean currents.</p>
<h2 id=what-process-does-the-sun-heat-the-earth>What process does the sun heat the Earth?</h2>
<p>radiation<br>
The sun heats the earth through radiation. Since there is no medium (like the gas in our atmosphere) in space, radiation is the primary way that heat travels in space. When the heat reaches the earth it warms the molecules of the atmosphere, and they warm other molecules and so on.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-ways-the-sun-influences-earth>What are 3 ways the sun influences Earth?</h2>
<p>The sun has extremely important influences on our planet: It drives weather, ocean currents, seasons, and climate, and makes plant life possible through photosynthesis. Without the sun’s heat and light, life on Earth would not exist.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-sun-a-planet>Is the sun a planet?</h2>
<p>The sun and moon are not planets when you consider the objects in space they orbit. For the sun to be a planet, it would have to orbit another sun. Although the sun is in a orbit, it moves around the center of mass of the Milky Way galaxy, not another star.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-suns-energy-affect-the-earth>How does the sun’s energy affect the Earth?</h2>
<p>Over many millennia the Earth-Sun orbital relationship can change the geographical distribution of the sun’s energy over the Earth’s surface.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-solar-cycle-happen-the-way-it-does>Why does the solar cycle happen the way it does?</h2>
<p>This, the researchers assert, is what controls the solar cycle. Venus, Earth, and Jupiter assert a small gravitational tug on the Sun as they orbit it. The result is comparable to the way the Moon’s gravity influences Earth’s tides, producing a regularly timed ebb and flow.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-energy-to-move-from-the-sun-to-the-earth>How long does it take for energy to move from the sun to the Earth?</h2>
<p>This phenomenon, which is called nuclear fusion, releases massive amounts of energy. The energy takes about 1 million years to move from the Sun’s core to its surface, where it gives off heat and light!</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-planets-in-the-solar-system-related-to-the-sun>How are the planets in the Solar System related to the Sun?</h2>
<p>Even though the Solar System’s planets are much smaller than the Sun, the gravity of some of them is able to influence our star’s magnetic field. This, the researchers assert, is what controls the solar cycle. Venus, Earth, and Jupiter assert a small gravitational tug on the Sun as they orbit it.</p>
