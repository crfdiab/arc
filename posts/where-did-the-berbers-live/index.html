<h2 id=where-did-the-berbers-live>Where did the Berbers live?</h2>
<p>The Berbers live in scattered communities across Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Mali, Niger, and Mauritania. They speak various Amazigh languages belonging to the Afro-Asiatic family related to ancient Egyptian.</p>
<h2 id=what-race-were-the-berbers>What race were the Berbers?</h2>
<p>Berbers are Caucasian, and came from the middle east/North Iran around 7–9000 years ago. They share the light skin gene with europeans (originated 6–9000 years ago). Berbers were part of a massive migration out of the middle east /North Iran that split up into 3 groups.</p>
<h2 id=where-were-the-berbers-from-and-what-did-they-do-initially-to-survive>Where were the Berbers from and what did they do initially to survive?</h2>
<p>The earliest evidence we have of the Berbers shows that they are descended from Stone Age tribes that lived around the coast of North Africa sometime around 5,000 BCE. As these tribes of people united by similar languages mingled together, they established a common identity that became the basis for the Berber culture.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-berbers-call-themselves>What do Berbers call themselves?</h2>
<p>Imazighen<br>
The Berbers call themselves “Imazighen”, meaning the free. Berbers are non-Arabic tribes that are often referred to as Arab-Islamic.</p>
<h2 id=what-religion-were-berbers>What religion were Berbers?</h2>
<p>Berber Religion One aspect of life where we do see the strong influence of Arab culture is in the religion of North African Berbers. The Berbers across this region are predominantly Sunni Muslim.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-berbers-live-in-northwest-africa>Where did the Berbers live in Northwest Africa?</h2>
<p>Enclaves of Berber tribes from Northwest Africa in Iberia today include the Sanhaja tribe in the rural parts of the Algarve (southern Portugal), and the Masmuda tribe in the Tagus and Sado river estuaries, with their capital at Santarem.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-berbers-in-morocco-call-themselves>What do the Berbers in Morocco call themselves?</h2>
<p>I n Morocco almost 2/3 of the inhabitants is Berber. They call themselves Imazighen. Although there are different interpretations of this word, in general it means “free people”. As history will show you: there is no such thing as 1 group of Berbers. They all live in different areas, came from different kingdoms and different tribes.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-for-the-althoug-berbers>What was life like for the althoug Berbers?</h2>
<p>The position of the Berbers is gradually improving. Althoug life is hard for many Berber families. Berbers have a lesser position on the labor market and less easy access to a good school. Many of them live in mountain areas, valleys or the desert.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-religion-did-the-berbers-have>What kind of religion did the Berbers have?</h2>
<p>Although the Romans where mostly Christian, just some Berber communities converted to Christianity. In that time a large group of Jews lived in Morocco, therefore some Berbers had converted to Judaism, but most of them had followed the more traditional polytheist religion. A lot of Berbers lived a nomadic lifestyle.</p>
