<h2 id=is-virginia-a-stand-your-ground-state-2021>Is Virginia a stand your ground state 2021?</h2>
<p>Virginia’s “No Retreat” or “Stand Your Ground” Law As a general rule, Virginia does not require a person to retreat before using deadly force when confronted with an aggressor. This focuses on the prior actions of the person claiming self defense.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-standard-for-the-insanity-defense-in-virginia>What is the standard for the insanity defense in Virginia?</h2>
<p>Never been defined by statute, the insanity defense in Virginia is entirely based on case law. “Mental disease or defect” is defined as a disorder that “substantially impairs the defendant’s capacity to understand or appreciate his conduct.” “Nature, character, and consequences” are not defined.</p>
<h2 id=is-virginia-a-duty-to-retreat-state>Is Virginia a duty to retreat State?</h2>
<p>Under Virginia’s castle doctrine, you are allowed to protect your home — your castle —when you have sufficient reason to believe that the person or people entering will try to cause great bodily harm or death upon entering. You are not obligated to retreat.</p>
<h2 id=which-state-has-stand-your-ground-law>Which state has stand your ground law?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-the-test-for-insanity-in-virginia>What is the test for insanity in Virginia?</h2>
<p>The test for insanity is not written into the Virginia code. Instead, case law has developed the test, which states that: As a result of mental disease or effect: The defendant did not understand the nature, character, and consequences of his or her act; OR.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-m-naghten-rule-state>What does the M Naghten rule state?</h2>
<p>Under the M’Naghten rule, a criminal defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity if, at the time of the alleged criminal act, the defendant was so deranged that she did not know the nature or quality of her actions or, if she knew the nature and quality of her actions, she was so deranged that she did not know that …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-law-in-virginia-if-someone-breaks-into-your-house>What is the law in Virginia if someone breaks into your house?</h2>
<p>That’s why Virginia Statute clearly states, if you have a reasonable belief that the person breaking into your home intends to hurt you, you can use deadly force to protect yourself or any others you believe are in danger. The law doesn’t apply to property.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-jurisdiction-does-the-va-supreme-court-have>What type of jurisdiction does the VA Supreme Court have?</h2>
