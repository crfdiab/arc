<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-kashmir-to-india-and-pakistan>What is the importance of Kashmir to India and Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Kashmir is a central piece between three nuclear nations: India, Pakistan and China. At the moment, of the original territory of Kashmir, India has control over roughly 55% of the total area, Pakistan controls 30% of the land and China controls 15% of it.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-kashmir-for-pakistan>What is the importance of Kashmir for Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Kashmir is important as Pakistan‟s water resources originate in Kashmir. Sardar Sikander Hayat, Prime Minister of POK said in a seminar on March 6, 2003, “without the rivers of Kashmir Pakistan will become desert. The freedom fighters of Kashmir are in reality fighting for Pakistan‟s water security”.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-pakistan-have-kashmir>How much Pakistan have Kashmir?</h2>
<p>Current status and political divisions. India has control of about half the area of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which comprises Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, while Pakistan controls a third of the region, divided into two provinces, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-india-or-pakistan-in-kashmir>Which is better India or Pakistan in Kashmir?</h2>
<p>The result so far is that India controls almost two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan controls one-third. China controls the rest. The conflict continues. I and, I believe, most scholars who have studied this issue feel that Pakistan has the stronger case.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-have-died-in-the-kashmir-conflict>How many people have died in the Kashmir conflict?</h2>
<p>Three major wars have been fought over this and thousands and perhaps even more than a million people have died. The result so far is that India controls almost two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan controls one-third. China controls the rest. The conflict continues.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-kashmir-issue-a-priority-for-the-un>Is the Kashmir issue a priority for the UN?</h2>
<p>It is unlikely that Kashmir will register as a top-priority issue on the UN’s radar anytime soon. The risk with such inattention is that the issue could be left to lapse and grow ever more perilous.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-maharaja-of-kashmir-join-india>How did the Maharaja of Kashmir join India?</h2>
<p>As a result, the Maharaja of Kashmir joined India and requested the assistance of the Indian Army. The Indian Army arrived immediately, the same day, and Pakistan attacked the next day.</p>
