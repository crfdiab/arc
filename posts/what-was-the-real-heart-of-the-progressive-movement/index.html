<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-progressive-movement-quizlet>What was the purpose of the Progressive movement quizlet?</h2>
<p>What were the goals of the Progressives? One was: before the first decade of the 20th century, the U.S. would be influenced by a “Progressive movement” that went against monopolies, corruption, inefficiency, and social injustice. The purpose of the Progressives was to use the government as an agency of human welfare.</p>
<h2 id=who-benefited-from-the-progressive-movement>Who benefited from the Progressive movement?</h2>
<p>Although the Progressive Era brought reform to government and business and increased political power for many citizens, its benefits were limited to white Americans; African Americans and other minorities continued to experience discrimination and marginalization during this era.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-progressive-movement-characterized-by>What was the Progressive movement characterized by?</h2>
<p>Characteristics of the Progressive Era include purification of the government, modernization, a focus on family and education, prohibition, and women’s suffrage.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-roots-of-the-progressive-movement-in-the-united-states-quizlet>What were the roots of the progressive movement in the United States quizlet?</h2>
<p>What were the roots of the progressive movement in the US? The progressive movement began in the United Sates in the late 1800 through the greenback and populist parties. People were starting to question the effectiveness of the laizze-fare economic policy as corporations began to take advantage of it.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-progressive-movement>What was the purpose of the Progressive Movement?</h2>
<p>The Progressive movement arose as a response to these negative effects of industrialization. Progressive reformers sought to regulate private industry, strengthen protections for workers and consumers, expose corruption in both government and big business, and generally improve society.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-dark-side-of-the-progressive-movement>What was the Dark Side of the Progressive Movement?</h2>
<p>The dark side of progressivism. The years of Wilson’s presidency (1913-1921) witnessed a revival of the Ku Klux Klan and a viciously racist backlash against the economic and political gains of African Americans in the post-Reconstruction period.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-not-addressed-by-women-in-the-progressive-movement>What was not addressed by women in the Progressive Movement?</h2>
<p>Which of the following was not among the issues addressed by women in the progressive movement? The case of Lochner v. New York represented a setback for progressives and labor advocates because the Supreme Court in its ruling President Roosevelt believed that the federal government should adopt a policy of __________________ trusts.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-end-of-the-progressive-era>What was the end of the Progressive Era?</h2>
<p>Personally, I find that WWI marked the end of the Progressive Era, as acts like the Sedition Act ended civil liberties that were crucial to women’s groups, pacifists, labor unions, etc; many of the Progressive groups also lost popular and governmental support due to their anti-war efforts.
