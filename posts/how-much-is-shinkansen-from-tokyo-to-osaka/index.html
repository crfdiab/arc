<h2 id=how-much-is-shinkansen-from-tokyo-to-osaka>How much is Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka?</h2>
<p>The most economical way of using the Shinkansen bullet trains is with a JR Pass as the individual tickets are relatively expensive. The travel between Tokyo and Osaka, a one-way ticket costs around 14,500 yen on a Nozomi train or 13,500 yen on a Hikari train.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-do-shinkansen-tickets-cost>How much do Shinkansen tickets cost?</h2>
<p>All Areas of Japan and JR Pass The price for a seven-day pass is 29,110 yen. For comparison, the regular Shinkansen fare for a one-way, reserved seat from Tokyo to Osaka is 14,450 yen, so purchasing this Japan Rail Pass makes up for the cost of a round trip.</p>
<h2 id=are-shinkansen-tickets-expensive>Are Shinkansen tickets expensive?</h2>
<p>Sure shinkansen is more convenient and better for day-of ticket purchasing, but it’s still expensive compared to flying. Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto costs around ¥18000 one way, which is around $150 and will take you ~450km in 2 hours.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-need-to-book-shinkansen-in-advance>Do I need to book Shinkansen in advance?</h2>
<p>You must order at least 3 days in advance before the day of travel. I would advise you to book your shinkansen tickets as far in advance as you can, during peak season like Christmas and New Year, cherry blossom season (April) and fall foliage season (November). It gets extremely busy and trains are often fully booked.</p>
<h2 id=should-i-buy-shinkansen-tickets-in-advance>Should I buy shinkansen tickets in advance?</h2>
<h2 id=can-i-buy-shinkansen-tickets-on-the-same-day>Can I buy shinkansen tickets on the same day?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can. However, you should try to get your ticket farther in advance if traveling at a busy time, such as certain dates around the New Year. You can make the reservation at any JR reservation office (all major stations and many smaller stations).</p>
<h2 id=can-i-ride-shinkansen-without-reservation>Can I ride Shinkansen without reservation?</h2>
<p>Non-reserved ( jiyuseki, 自由席) If you don’t reserve a seat you must sit in a non-reserved car where seats are first come, first serve. Some shinkansen lines don’t have this class (seat reservations are mandatory).</p>

<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-ride-the-shinkansen-gran-class>How much does it cost to ride the Shinkansen Gran Class?</h2>
<p>The first trains with a Gran Class option began running on the Tohoku Shinkansen Line in 2011. The line covers Tokyo Station to Shin-Aomori Station near Hokkaido. The trip from Tokyo to Aomori City takes approximately three hours and costs ¥26,360 – ¥9,870 for the train fare, and an additional ¥16,490 to upgrade to Gran Class seating.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-slowest-shinkansen-from-tokyo-to-osaka>Which is the slowest Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka?</h2>
<p>Platt Kodama offers a discount ticket of 10,300 yen on the Kodama shinkansen between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka. This is the slowest of the shinkansen train types on the Tokaido route and takes about 4 hours to cover the distance because it stops at all stations.</p>
