<h2 id=how-much-rainfall-is-in-the-deciduous-forest>How much rainfall is in the deciduous forest?</h2>
<p>The annual rainfall in a temperate deciduous forest is 75 to 150 centimeters (30 to 60 inches) a year. Temperate deciduous forests receive more rain annually than any other environment except rain forests. In winter, precipitation may fall as snow.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-rainfall-does-a-forest-get>How much rainfall does a forest get?</h2>
<p>The average rainfall in most rain forests is very heavy, about 200–450 centimeters (80–180 inches) per year. Some areas, however, get as much as 1000 centimeters (400 inches) of rain per year!</p>
<h2 id=how-much-rainfall-does-the-dry-deciduous-forest-need>How much rainfall does the dry deciduous forest need?</h2>
<p>The region’s annual rainfall is around 100 cm and 75% humidity (Khullar 2014). Tropical dry deciduous forests occur in the region with very low rainfall of 100-150cm with 5-6 dry months (Singh and Chaturvedi 2017) .</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-precipitation-in-a-deciduous-forest>What’s the average precipitation in a deciduous forest?</h2>
<p>The image above shows a temperate deciduous forest during the winter season. In temperate deciduous forests, the average annual precipitation ranges from 30” to 60” in the form of rain and snow and it is dispersed evenly throughout the year. Temperate deciduous rainforests have more than 60” of annual precipitation.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-average-rainfall-in-a-temperate-rainforest>What’s the average rainfall in a temperate rainforest?</h2>
<p>Precipitation. In temperate deciduous forests, the average annual precipitation ranges from 30” to 60” in the form of rain and snow and it is dispersed evenly throughout the year. Temperate deciduous rainforests have more than 60” of annual precipitation. In tropical and subtropical deciduous forests, the annual rainfall is over 80”…</p>
<h2 id=how-many-seasons-does-a-deciduous-forest-have>How many seasons does a deciduous forest have?</h2>
<p>Tropical and subtropical deciduous forests only have 2 seasons, rainy and dry, with the leaves dropping in the dry season. These forests have a much narrower annual temperature range of 68°F to 77°F. They are located in and around the equatorial regions of the planet.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-deciduous-forests-be-found-in-the-world>Where can deciduous forests be found in the world?</h2>
<p>Temperate forests are found in eastern North America, Western Europe, Chile, New Zealand and Eastern Asia. Temperate deciduous forests need to have a growing season of 140-200 days within a 4-6 month period without frost.</p>
