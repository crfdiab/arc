<h2 id=what-us-city-has-the-largest-german-population>What US city has the largest German population?</h2>
<p>Pennsylvania has the largest population of German-Americans in the U.S. and is home to one of the group’s original settlements, Germantown (Philadelphia), founded in 1683 and the birthplace of the American antislavery movement in 1688, as well as the revolutionary Battle of Germantown.</p>
<h2 id=which-us-state-has-the-most-german-population>Which US state has the most German population?</h2>
<p>Pennsylvania<br>
Pennsylvania has the largest population of German-Americans and is home to one of the group’s original settlements, Germantown in 1683. The state has 3.5 million people claiming German ancestry — more than in Berlin.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-german-are-in-the-usa>How many German are in the USA?</h2>
<p>Today, more than 40 million Americans claim German ancestry.”</p>
<h2 id=is-german-spoken-in-pennsylvania>Is German spoken in Pennsylvania?</h2>
<p>Around 40,000 people speak the dialect in Pennsylvania alone, and around 400,000 across America. The number is rising since many Amish and Mennonites faith communities who speak Pennsylvania German as their mother tongue traditionally have large families.</p>
<h2 id=what-percent-of-america-is-irish>What percent of America is Irish?</h2>
<p>9.7%<br>
Irish Americans or Hiberno Americans (Irish: Gael-Mheiriceánaigh) are Americans who have full or partial ancestry from Ireland. About 32 million Americans — 9.7% of the total population — identified as being Irish in the 2019 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-say-hello-in-amish>How do you say hello in Amish?</h2>
<p>If they’re speaking English, they can say Hi, Hello, Hallo. If they’re speaking high German: Wie geht’s (literally “how goes it?”). If they’re speaking Pennsylvania Dutch: Wie bischt or guta Dag.</p>
<h2 id=is-pennsylvania-dutch-and-german-the-same>Is Pennsylvania Dutch and German the same?</h2>
<p>The term is more properly “Pennsylvania German” because the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch have nothing to do with Holland, the Netherlands, or the Dutch language. These settlers originally came from German-speaking areas of Europe and spoke a dialect of German they refer to as “Deitsch” (Deutsch).</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-speak-german-in-the-united-states>How many people speak German in the United States?</h2>
<p>Over 50 million Americans claim German ancestry, which makes them the largest single claimed ethnic group in the United States. Around 1.06 million people in the United States speak the German language. It is the second most spoken language in North Dakota. In 16 states, it is the most spoken language other than English and Spanish.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-federal-states-are-there-in-germany>How many federal states are there in Germany?</h2>
<p>How many states in Germany are there? Germany consists of 16 federal states, which you can see listed below. Bayern (Bavaria), Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony) and Baden-Württemberg are the largest federal states and Bremen is the smallest federal state. Each state has a state capital.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-counties-in-america-where-people-still-speak-german>Are there any counties in America where people still speak German?</h2>
<p>That includes Holmes County, Ohio, where 45.5 (!) percent of residents speak German at home, as well as a single county (Yates) in New York and Missouri (Scotland) where German remains actively spoken by a chunk of residents. The full map is below. Fascinating stuff.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-german-become-the-official-language-of-the-united-states>When did German become the official language of the United States?</h2>
<p>Claim: A proposal to make German the official language of the United States of America was defeated in Congress by one vote. Status: False. Origins: Legend has it that in 1795 a bill to establish German as the official language of the fledgling United States of America was defeated in Congress by a single vote.</p>
