<h2 id=how-do-plants-adapt-in-the-temperate-zone>How do plants adapt in the temperate zone?</h2>
<p>Plant Adaptations in the Deciduous Forest Biome Trees have thick bark to protect them in the cold winters. Deciduous trees drop their leaves prior to the winter which lets them store water/moisture and survive the cold winter. When the leaves are dropped, the trees and plants seal the open area to retain moisture.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-plants-in-the-temperate-rainforest>What are plants in the temperate rainforest?</h2>
<p>Mosses, spike mosses, ferns and lichens festoon tree trunks and branches, giving the forest a “jungle-like” feel. Large, old trees. The dominant species are Sitka spruce and western hemlock, but other conifers and several deciduous species grow as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-plants-and-animals-live-in-the-temperate-forest>What kind of plants and animals live in the temperate forest?</h2>
<p>Insects, spiders, slugs, frogs, turtles and salamanders are common. In North America, birds like broad-winged hawks, cardinals, snowy owls, and pileated woodpeckers are found in this biome. Mammals in North American temperate deciduous forests include white-tailed deer, raccoons, opossums, porcupines and red foxes.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-adaptations-of-plants-in-the-grasslands>What are the adaptations of plants in the grasslands?</h2>
<p>Plants have many adaptations to survive the Grasslands Biome. The plants have deep, spreading root systems that allow them strength and moisture during times of drought. Most of the plants have long narrow leaves that don’t need as much water. The grasses grow from the bottom and grow close to the ground.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-plants-adapted-to-live-in-a-rain-forest>How are plants adapted to live in a rain forest?</h2>
<p>Rain Forest Plants. Temperate rain forests receive more than 100 inches of rain every year. So in the rain forest, plants must adapt to the moist environment. The trees grow bark that protects the inner core from cold temperature, while protecting the tree from parasitic fungi.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-tree-adapt-to-the-climate>How does a tree adapt to the climate?</h2>
<p>Plant adaptations In SUMMER, their broad green leaves help capture sunlight needed to make food through photosynthesis. As temperatures drop, the tree cuts off the supply of water to the leaves and seals off the area between the leaf stem and the tree trunk.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-temperate-forest-animal-adaptations>What are some temperate forest animal adaptations?</h2>
<p>Animal Adaptations. Animals that are in temperate deciduous forests have to adapt to the changing seasons. They have to deal with cold winters when it’s hard to supply food. Migration and hibernations are two adaptations used by animals in this biome.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-adaptations-of-a-deciduous-forest>What are the adaptations of a deciduous forest?</h2>
<p>Deciduous Forest Plants. The trees grow large leaves to absorb the most possible light during the growing season. The bark of deciduous trees is thicker and heartier than tropical trees to protect the inner core during long, hard winters. Smaller plants, such as flowers and ferns, grow early in the spring with long, quick-growing leaves.</p>
