<h2 id=did-maryland-have-slaves-during-the-civil-war>Did Maryland have slaves during the Civil War?</h2>
<p>During the American Civil War (1861–1865), Maryland, a slave state, was one of the border states, straddling the South and North. Despite some popular support for the cause of the Confederate States of America, Maryland would not secede during the Civil War.</p>
<h2 id=what-date-did-slavery-end-in-maryland>What date did slavery end in Maryland?</h2>
<p>November 1<br>
1863- Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation, which frees all slaves in the territories currently in rebellion. 1864- On November 1, slavery is abolished in Maryland.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-maryland-rely-on-slaves>Why did Maryland rely on slaves?</h2>
<p>Maryland colonists turned to importing indentured and enslaved Africans to satisfy the labor demand. By the 18th century, Maryland had developed into a plantation colony and slave society, requiring extensive numbers of field hands for the labor-intensive commodity crop of tobacco.</p>
<h2 id=which-part-of-america-had-the-most-slaves>Which part of America had the most slaves?</h2>
<p>New York<br>
New York had the greatest number, with just over 20,000. New Jersey had close to 12,000 slaves. Vermont was the first Northern region to abolish slavery when it became an independent republic in 1777.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-indentured-servants-settle-in-maryland>How did the indentured servants settle in Maryland?</h2>
<p>To search this database for indentured servants, you need to know that Maryland was settled primarily due to a “process of headrights” in which a person was granted 50 acres of land for every additional person that he transported to Maryland.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-indentured-servants-in-the-united-states>Are there indentured servants in the United States?</h2>
<p>While parallels do exist, indentured servants were not slaves and their plight cannot be compared to that of African slaves in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-become-a-slave-in-maryland>Who was the first person to become a slave in Maryland?</h2>
<p>In an unusual case, Nell Butler was an Irish-born indentured servant of Lord Calvert. After she married an enslaved African, her indenture was converted to slavery for life under the 1664 Act. Further legislation would follow, entrenching and deepening the institution of slavery.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-institution-of-slavery-in-maryland-work>How did the institution of slavery in Maryland work?</h2>
<p>And all children born of any negro or other slave shall be slaves as their fathers were for the term of their lives. In this way the institution of slavery in Maryland was made self-perpetuating, as the slaves had good enough health to reproduce. The numbers of slaves in Maryland was increased even more by continued imports up until 1808.</p>
