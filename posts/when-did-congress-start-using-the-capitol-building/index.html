<p>1793<br>
The construction of the U.S. Capitol Building began in 1793, and for over a century it was the only building created for the use of the nation’s legislature. In fact, the Capitol initially housed not only the Congress but also the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court, the district courts and other offices.</p>

<h2 id=is-capitol-hill-the-same-as-the-white-house>Is capitol Hill the same as the White House?</h2>
<p>No — two different buildings, functions, and locations. The Capitol is where Congress is supposed to work. The White House is where the President works and lives. You can request tours of both from your members of Congress.</p>
<h2 id=is-capitol-hill-a-public-building>Is capitol Hill a public building?</h2>
<p>The public entrance to the U.S. Capitol is through the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. The U.S. Capitol is open to the public for tours Monday – Saturday from 8:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. It is closed on Sundays, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, and Inauguration Day.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-the-secretary-of-state-when-the-capitol-building-was-built>Who was the Secretary of State when the capitol building was built?</h2>
<p>In order to find the design for the Capitol Building, Thomas Jefferson, who was Secretary of State at the time, came up with another great idea, which was to organize a competition to find the ultimate design for one of the most important buildings in the United States. This competition started in 1792 and drew at least 10 submissions.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-dome-of-the-capitol-built>When was the dome of the Capitol built?</h2>
<p>The original Capitol Building was completed in 1800 6. The Capitol was severely burned in the War of 1812 7. The dome was built in the 1850’s during a serious expansion 8. A huge fresco was painted on the dome’s oculus 9. The old columns of the Capitol Building are now a monument 10. The Capitol was declared a National Historic Landmark 11.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-they-build-the-capitol-visitor-center>When did they build the Capitol Visitor Center?</h2>
<p>In the late 20 th century, as the number of visitors grew, Congress recognized the need for better visitor amenities and accessibility, improved safety and security, and better opportunities for citizens to learn about their Congress and Capitol. The construction of the new Capitol Visitor Center began in 2001.</p>
