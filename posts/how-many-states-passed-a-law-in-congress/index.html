<h2 id=how-many-states-passed-a-law-in-congress>How many states passed a law in Congress?</h2>
<p>Instead, on September 28, Congress directed the state legislatures to call ratification conventions in each state. Article VII stipulated that nine states had to ratify the Constitution for it to go into effect.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-states-did-it-take-to-pass-a-law-or-approve-congressional-action>How many states did it take to pass a law or approve congressional action?</h2>
<p>Congress must call a convention for proposing amendments upon application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the states (i.e., 34 of 50 states). Amendments proposed by Congress or convention become valid only when ratified by the legislatures of, or conventions in, three-fourths of the states (i.e., 38 of 50 states).</p>
<h2 id=how-many-states-did-the-confederation-congress-need-to-pass-a-law>How many states did the Confederation Congress need to pass a law?</h2>
<p>Because the smaller states feared the domination of the larger ones, each state had one vote in the Confederation Congress, regardless of its size or population. Any act of Congress required the votes of nine of the thirteen states to pass.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-congressmen-does-it-take-to-pass-a-law>How many congressmen does it take to pass a law?</h2>
<p>If the bill passes by simple majority (218 of 435), the bill moves to the Senate. In the Senate, the bill is assigned to another committee and, if released, debated and voted on. Again, a simple majority (51 of 100) passes the bill.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-60-vote-rule-in-the-us-senate>What is the 60 vote rule in the US Senate?</h2>
<p>The 60-vote rule In effect, the rule requires three-fifths of the total number of senators to vote to close debate and not necessarily those present and voting.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-60-vote-rule-in-the-us-senate-1>What is the 60 vote rule in the U.S. Senate?</h2>
<h2 id=how-many-bills-did-congress-pass-in-the-115th-congress>How many bills did Congress pass in the 115th Congress?</h2>
<p>But behindits partisan battles and legislative dysfunction, the 115th Congress still managed to quietly pass into law 74 bills and 23 joint resolutions, which carry the weight of law.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-laws-passed-by-the-116th-congress>Are there any laws passed by the 116th Congress?</h2>
<p>Despite its late burst of activity, the 116th was overall one of the least legislatively productive Congresses of the past five decades. Of the 24 Congresses we analyzed, only four passed fewer laws than the 116th – three of them within the past decade.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-laws-did-each-congress-actually-make>How many laws did each Congress actually make?</h2>
<p>We’ve chosen a fairly straightforward approach: how many laws (public laws in most cases, as opposed to private laws that apply to single individuals) each Congress actually enacted. We also distinguish between substantive and ceremonial laws.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-new-laws-have-congress-passed-since-world-war-2>How many new laws have Congress passed since World War 2?</h2>
<p>Note that the current Congress is not yet finished. Since World War II (the earliest we have data), Congress has typically enacted 4-6 million words of new law in each two-year Congress. However, those words have been enacted in fewer but larger bills.</p>
