<h2 id=how-did-oklahoma-get-its-name>How did Oklahoma get its name?</h2>
<p>Oklahoma is a Choctaw Indian word that means “red people.” It is derived from the words for people (okla) and red (humma).</p>
<h2 id=who-suggested-the-name-oklahoma>Who suggested the name Oklahoma?</h2>
<p>The state’s name is from the Choctaw words “okla” and “humma,” meaning “red people.” The Choctaw Nation website says following the trail of tears, it was a Choctaw Chief who suggested the Oklahoma name during treaty negotiations – and he was referring to the people’s skin color.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-oklahomans>What do you call Oklahomans?</h2>
<p>Oklahoma. People who live in Oklahoma are called Oklahomans, Okies and Sooners.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-indiana-and-oklahoma-get-their-names>How did Indiana and Oklahoma get their names?</h2>
<p>It helps to remember that two states have their names in the names of their capital cities — Indiana (Indianapolis) and Oklahoma (Oklahoma City). Indianapolis derived its name from the state’s name, which means “Land of Indians,” and “polis” is the Greek word for “city.” Oklahoma City was not the state’s original territorial capital.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-oklahoma-become-part-of-the-united-states>When did Oklahoma become part of the United States?</h2>
<p>/ 35.4; -97 The Territory of Oklahoma was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from May 2, 1890, until November 16, 1907, when it was joined with the Indian Territory under a new constitution and admitted to the Union as the State of Oklahoma .</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-governor-of-the-oklahoma-territory>Who was the first governor of the Oklahoma Territory?</h2>
<p>Territorial Governor Frank Frantz oversaw the transition from territory to state. He was selected as the Republican nominee to serve as the state’s first Governor. He faced the Democratic Charles N. Haskell in the election on September 17, 1907. In the same election, the Oklahoma Constitution was proposed.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-original-capital-of-oklahoma-city>What was the original capital of Oklahoma City?</h2>
<p>Oklahoma City was not the state’s original territorial capital. That honor goes to Guthrie, Oklahoma, which retained the title until 1910 when Oklahoma City took over as the state’s commercial hub and population center.:</p>
