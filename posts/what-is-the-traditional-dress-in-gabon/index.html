<h2 id=what-is-the-traditional-dress-in-gabon>What is the traditional dress in Gabon?</h2>
<p>Traditional. A traditional Gabonese clothing item is a boubou, which is a flowing top that can be floor-length or knee-length. Celebrations often demand elaborate boubous. Men wear boubous with loosefitting trousers underneath, while women wear double-wrapped pagnes as a skirt.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-people-in-gabon-greet-each-other>How do people in Gabon greet each other?</h2>
<p>Gabonese greetings between strangers are reserved. Friends greet each other with a series of four kisses, two on each cheek, as people do in parts of France. Sometimes just touching cheeks will do. Men often walk holding hands, a sign of brotherly affection.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-culture-like-in-gabon>What is the culture like in Gabon?</h2>
<p>Gabon’s history is similar to that of other former French colonies in Africa. The culture is highly influenced, not only by its ethnic background and proximity to other West African nations, but also by French control. Dance, song, myths, and poetry are important elements of Gabonese life.</p>
<h2 id=is-gabon-safe>Is Gabon safe?</h2>
<p>Although Gabon is, by and large, a safe country in which few travellers experience any problems, it doesn’t hurt to remain cautious and be prepared for potential dangers. Contrary to what you might expect, tropical disease, most notably malaria, poses the biggest safety threat at any time of year.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-someone-from-gabon>What do you call someone from Gabon?</h2>
<p>Gabonese may refer to: A person from Gabon, or of Gabonese descent; see ethnic groups in Gabon. Gabonese cuisine.</p>

<p>A traditional Gabonese clothing item is a boubou, which is a flowing top that can be floor-length or knee-length. Celebrations often demand elaborate boubous. Men wear boubous with loosefitting trousers underneath, while women wear double-wrapped pagnes as a skirt.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-wear-to-the-national-parks-in-gabon>What to wear to the national parks in Gabon?</h2>
<p>Good walking boots are essential for visiting the national parks, as is a light waterproof jacket, even in the dry season. The Gabonese love to dress up so bring your gladrags if you intend to hang out at the clubs and smarter restaurants in Libreville and Port-Gentil.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-culture-do-people-in-gabon-have>What kind of culture do people in Gabon have?</h2>
<p>The Fang, for example, inhabit northern Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, southern Cameroon, and the western part of the Republic of Congo. The cultures of the ethnic groups are akin to other groups in Central Africa, and center around the rain forest and its treasures. Food preferences, farming practices, and quality of life are comparable.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-clothing-do-people-wear-in-africa>What kind of clothing do people wear in Africa?</h2>
<p>Africans living in remote regions wear only traditional clothing that reflect some European contact. Kaftans, which are also called boubous, are full-length embroidered robes. This garment, which today is mainly worn by East African women, was originally only worn by West African men.</p>
