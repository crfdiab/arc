<h2 id=should-you-drink-water-if-you-have-heat-exhaustion>Should you drink water if you have heat exhaustion?</h2>
<p>If you or your child has signs of heat exhaustion, it’s essential to rest in a cool place and drink plenty of water. Seek immediate medical care if symptoms don’t get better after about an hour. To prevent heat exhaustion, stay hydrated, especially if you’re exercising in hot weather.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-you-feel-bad-after-heat-exhaustion>How long do you feel bad after heat exhaustion?</h2>
<p>Heat exhaustion symptoms typically last 30 minutes or less when treated promptly. Complete recovery may take anywhere from 24 to 48 hours. To shorten the duration of heat exhaustion, drink plenty of fluids and seek out a cool place to rest and recover.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-considered-extreme-heat>What is considered extreme heat?</h2>
<p>Extreme heat is defined as summertime temperatures that are much hotter and/or humid than average. Because some places are hotter than others, this depends on what’s considered average for a particular location at that time of year. Humid and muggy conditions can make it seem hotter than it really is.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-heat-advisory-and-an-excessive-heat-warning>What is the difference between a heat advisory and an excessive heat warning?</h2>
<p>Heat watches are issued when conditions are favorable for an excessive heat event in the next 24 to 72 hours. A Watch is used when the risk of a heat wave has increased but its occurrence and timing is still uncertain. Heat Advisory—Take Action! Take precautions to avoid heat illness.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-eat-after-heat-exhaustion>What should I eat after heat exhaustion?</h2>
<p>Protect your head and neck with a hat or umbrella when you are outdoors. Drink lots of water or sports drinks. Avoid alcohol. Eat salty foods, such as salted crackers, and salted pretzels.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-first-signs-of-heat-exhaustion>What are the first signs of heat exhaustion?</h2>
<p>WHAT TO LOOK FOR</p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy sweating.</li>
<li>Cold, pale, and clammy skin.</li>
<li>Fast, weak pulse.</li>

<h2 id=what-to-do-when-someone-is-suffering-from-heat-exhaustion>What to do when someone is suffering from heat exhaustion?</h2>
<p>Administering First Aid Get to a cool place. Do whatever you can to cool the person suffering from heat exhaustion. Monitor and reduce the internal body temperature. With heat exhaustion, the person’s temperature may only be slightly elevated, if at all. Loosen or remove clothing.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-weather-like-on-the-oregon-trail>What was the weather like on the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>Perils along the way caused many would-be emigrants to turn back. Weather related dangers included thunderstorms, lethally large hailstones, lightning, tornadoes, and high winds. The intense heat of the deserts caused wood to shrink, and wagon wheels had to be soaked in rivers at night to keep their iron rims from rolling right off during the day.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-deal-with-heat-stroke-in-the-outdoors>How to deal with heat stroke in the outdoors?</h2>
<p>If you even suspect heat exhaustion or heat stroke, move the victim out of the heat as quickly as possible. If an air-conditioned vehicle or building is not available, move the victim to a shaded area and remove excess clothing. If ice is available, gently apply ice packs to the neck, armpits, and groin.</p>
<h2 id=when-to-call-911-for-heat-exhaustion-and-heatstroke>When to call 911 for heat exhaustion and heatstroke?</h2>
<p>If a person is displaying known heat illness symptoms, take their temperature. A reading of 104°F or more means they probably have heatstroke. You should call 911 and get medical care right away. Can heat exhaustion and heatstroke be prevented or avoided?</p>
