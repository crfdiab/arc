<h2 id=how-does-heavy-rainfall-cause-flooding>How does heavy rainfall cause flooding?</h2>
<p>When there is more rain than the soil can absorb, the excess water quickly runs into rivers and creeks, overwhelming storm drains and ditches and causing a flash flood.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-heavy-rainfall-a-problem>Why is heavy rainfall a problem?</h2>
<p>Heavy rainfall can lead to numerous hazards, for example: flooding, including risk to human life, damage to buildings and infrastructure, and loss of crops and livestock. landslides, which can threaten human life, disrupt transport and communications, and cause damage to buildings and infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id=what-human-activity-can-cause-flooding>What human activity can cause flooding?</h2>
<p>Human activities that degrade the environment often increases flooding. These activities include: Deforestation. The lack of vegetation encourages water to flow over the surface rather than infiltrate into the soil thus increasing surface runoff.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-rain-cause-a-river-to-flood>How does rain cause a river to flood?</h2>
<p>Flash flood is not caused particularly by rain but is always accompanied with heavy and intense rainfall. Rain can cause a river flood and a flood in a city. As it rains heavily and continuously, the water level in a river starts to rise and goes over the edges of the river, which leads to a flood.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-physical-factors-that-cause-flooding>What are the physical factors that cause flooding?</h2>
<p>Physical factors are those which are caused by nature. Human factors are when human intervention and interference create the conditions for flooding. Flooding is caused by heavy rainfall. The faster the rainwater reaches the river channel, the more likely it is to flood.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-steep-valleys-more-likely-to-flood>Why are steep valleys more likely to flood?</h2>
<p>The faster the water reaches the river, the more likely it will flood. Relief – a steep valley is more likely to flood than a flatter valley because the rainfall will run off into the river more quickly. Geology – permeable rocks allow water to pass through pores and cracks, whereas impermeable rocks do not.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-heavy-rain-in-the-united-states>What causes heavy rain in the United States?</h2>
<p>Heavy rains were produced by convective storms. Surface dewpoint temperatures were very high. Large moisture contents were present through a deep tropospheric layer. Vertical wind shear was weak to moderate through the cloud depth.</p>
