<h2 id=what-did-nelson-mandela-realize>What did Nelson Mandela realize?</h2>
<p>Mandela realized that his brothers and sisters were not free in their own country due to their color. The freedom of everyone in his society was curtailed. Congress and fought for the freedom.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-nelson-mandela-quotes>Who is Nelson Mandela quotes?</h2>
<p>“A winner is a dreamer who never gives up.” “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” “Do not judge me by my successes, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again.” “The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.”</p>
<h2 id=what-is-apartheid-and-how-did-it-affect-south-africa-class-10-english>What is Apartheid and how did it affect South Africa Class 10 English?</h2>
<p>Complete answer: Apartheid was a system of legislation that upheld segregationist policies against non-white citizens of South Africa. Under this law, nonwhite South Africans (a majority of the population) would be forced to live in separate areas from whites and use separate public facilities.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-law-justice-and-morality-in-south-africa>Is there Law, Justice and morality in South Africa?</h2>
<p>South Africa, viewed from the lens of law, justice and morality, is a society that for a long time was at odds with itself.

<p>Most notably, during apartheid, sophists supporting the regime would rely on what is termed Plato’s “useful falsehood”. In The Republic, [i] Plato argues that human beings (like the metals gold, silver, and iron and bronze) ‘possess different natures that fit each of them to a particular function within the operation of the society as a whole.’</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-end-of-apartheid-in-south-africa>When was the end of apartheid in South Africa?</h2>
<p>The End of Apartheid and the Beginning of National Reconciliation. By the 1980s, resistance to apartheid had reached its peak. Many feared that a civil war in South Africa was inevitable. At last, leaders of the ruling National Party were left with little choice but to consider a drastic change of course.</p>
