<h2 id=what-did-champlain-do-the-first-nations>What did Champlain do the first Nations?</h2>
<p>He also helped found French colonies in Acadia and at Trois-Rivières, and he established friendly relations and alliances with many First Nations, including the Montagnais, the Huron, the Odawa and the Nipissing. For many years, he was the chief person responsible for administrating the colony of New France.</p>
<h2 id=was-samuel-de-champlain-successful>Was Samuel de Champlain successful?</h2>
<p>Champlain found an area on the shores of the St. Lawrence river and began constructing a fort and other buildings. In July 1608, Samuel de Champlain and his men created the first successful French colony in New France. Champlain returned to France and reported the success of creating the settlement of Quebec.</p>
<h2 id=did-france-own-quebec>Did France own Quebec?</h2>
<p>Modern Quebec was part of the territory of New France, the general name for the North American possessions of France until 1763. At its largest extent, before the Treaty of Utrecht, this territory included several colonies, each with its own administration: Canada, Acadia, Hudson Bay, and Louisiana.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-samuel-de-champlain-treat-the-first-nations>How did Samuel de Champlain treat the First Nations?</h2>
<p>Samuel de Champlain maintained very good relations with all the First Nations, except for the Five Nations Confederacy. What first nations interacted with Samuel de Champlain? The Mi’kmaq and the Innu</p>
<h2 id=where-did-henry-champlain-go-on-his-raid>Where did Henry Champlain go on his raid?</h2>
<p>So it was in the summer of 1609, the next after the founding of the city of Quebec, that Champlain joined a party of his Indian allies on a raid into the Iroquois country. They travelled up the St. Lawrence and the river Richelieu to the lake which is now called by his name. Here they met their enemies.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-samuel-de-champlain-spend-his-winters>Where did Samuel de Champlain spend his winters?</h2>
<p>Champlain spent three winters in Acadia—the first on an island in the St. Croix River, where scurvy killed nearly half the party, and the second and third, which claimed the lives of fewer men, at Annapolis Basin.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-samuel-de-champlain-cross-the-great-lakes>When did Samuel de Champlain cross the Great Lakes?</h2>
<p>Samuel de Champlain first sailed in 1608 when he became the first European to cross the great lakes. Did Samuel de Champlain have any bad interactions with the first nations peoples?</p>
