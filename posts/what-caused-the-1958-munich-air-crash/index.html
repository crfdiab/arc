<p>An initial investigation blamed Thain, and German airport authorities attempted legal action against him. However, he was cleared a decade later when subsequent investigations revealed that the crash was caused by the slush on the runway which slowed down the aircraft.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-survived-munich-air-disaster>How many survived Munich air disaster?</h2>
<p>21 survivors<br>
