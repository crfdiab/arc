<h2 id=is-it-bad-to-think-before-sleeping>Is it bad to think before sleeping?</h2>
<p>Whatever you decide on, happy thoughts before bed are a powerful way to clear your brain of negativity, drift off to sleep calmly and enjoy a wonderful night’s rest.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-think-before-we-sleep>Why do we think before we sleep?</h2>
<p>The vast majority of our thinking efforts goes on subconsciously. Once those preconscious thoughts gather sufficient strength, the full spotlight of consciousness beams down on them. The mind’s freewheeling friskiness is only partly under our control, so shutting our mind off before we sleep is not possible.</p>

<h2 id=who-is-the-person-you-think-about-before-you-fall-asleep>Who is the person you think about before you fall asleep?</h2>

<h2 id=what-do-you-think-about-when-you-go-to-sleep>What do you think about when you go to sleep?</h2>
<p>I suppose we don’t always think of one specific person. Sometimes it’s things, just, completely random stuff.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-think-someone-is-thinking-about-you>When do you think someone is thinking about you?</h2>
<p>This is particularly true if it is someone that you have not thought about in a long time. 2. There is no emotional charge. Often when someone is thinking about you there will be an emotional charge to the thought. You may think suddenly of someone you broke up with romantically or a friend who is no longer in your life.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-creepy-to-think-about-someone-all-the-time>Is it creepy to think about someone all the time?</h2>
<p>It can feel a little creepy because they’re probably oblivious to how you feel, but it’s beyond your control. That person doesn’t know that you thought about them multiple times throughout the day, and at one point even looked forward to resting your head on the pillow so you could be alone with those pleasant notions.</p>
