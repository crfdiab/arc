<h2 id=how-much-was-an-average-house-in-1975>How much was an average house in 1975?</h2>
<p>According to most experts, this is the most accurate measure of home sales price growth or decline in a given year. Over this 36 year period, the average annual price increase in California has been 8.9%….</p>
<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Median Price</th><th>Increase/Decrease</th></tr><tr><td>1974</td><td>$34,610</td><td>10.0%</td></tr><tr><td>1975</td><td>$41,600</td><td>20.2%</td></tr><tr><td>1976</td><td>$48,630</td><td>16.9%</td></tr><tr><td>1977</td><td>$62,290</td><td>28.1%</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-was-the-average-cost-of-a-home-in-the-us-in-1970>What was the average cost of a home in the US in 1970?</h2>
<p>In 1970, the national median home value adjusted for inflation was $107,291; in 2017, it’s $217,600 — that’s a 103% increase. In fact, more than half of all US States (including Washington, DC) have seen a median home value increase of more than 100%.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-did-the-average-house-cost-in-1976>How much did the average house cost in 1976?</h2>
<p>A new house cost around $43,000, the price of a postage stamp was 13 cents, and the retail price for a gallon of gas averaged 59 cents.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-would-a-house-cost-in-1980s>How much would a house cost in 1980s?</h2>
<p>Houses weren’t always this expensive. In 1940, the median home value in the U.S. was just $2,938. In 1980, it was $47,200, and by 2000, it had risen to $119,600. By early 1985, the average sale price for a new home was $96,200.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-was-a-gallon-of-milk-in-1975>How much was a gallon of milk in 1975?</h2>
<p>1975: $1.57 per gallon.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cost-of-a-new-home-in-1975>What was the cost of a new home in 1975?</h2>
<p>First, let us look at the biggest line item with housing. A new home today costs $270,200. That 1975 home adjusting for inflation would cost $209,417. This is a “real” increase of 29 percent.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-historical-home-prices-in-the-united-states>Are there historical home prices in the United States?</h2>
<p>I needed historical median home prices on the United States housing market – and (of course) this data doesn’t really exist. The Census Bureau provides data on median new home sales, but nothing for existing home sales. This data uses the non-seasonally adjusted housing price index data from Robert Shiller and the FHFA to mash up these values.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-median-home-price-in-1974>What was the median home price in 1974?</h2>
<p>Recession struck again throughout 1974, with an extended decline that actually began the prior year and lasted all the way until March 1975. Despite the economic slowdown, home prices proved surprisingly resilient, jumping to a median of $35,900 ($177,891.04 with inflation).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-median-household-income-in-1975>What was the median household income in 1975?</h2>
<p>Milk, eggs, and a postage stamp. Unfortunately these are tiny line items on your household budget. What you need to look at is the median income here. US households overall are simply poorer. They have less to spend relative to the cost of goods and services. Money is only as good as what it can purchase. You can’t eat hundred dollar bills.</p>
