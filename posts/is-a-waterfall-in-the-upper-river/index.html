<h2 id=is-a-waterfall-in-the-upper-river>Is a waterfall in the upper river?</h2>
<p>Waterfalls are upper course river landforms. In the upper course of a river gradients are steep and river channels are narrow. Vertical erosion is greatest in the upper course of a river. Waterfalls commonly form where water rushes down steep hillsides in upland areas and quickly erodes the rocks.</p>
<h2 id=in-which-part-of-a-river-does-a-waterfall-form>In which part of a river does a waterfall form?</h2>
<p>Waterfalls commonly form where water rushes down steep hillsides in upland areas. They are typical of the upper valley but can be found in the rivers lower courses where the process of rejuvenation creates enough potential energy for vertical erosion to recommence closer to the mouth of the river.</p>
<h2 id=at-what-stage-of-a-river-would-you-find-a-waterfall>At what stage of a river would you find a waterfall?</h2>
<p>youth stage<br>
A waterfall is a feature of erosion found in the youth stage of a river. Waterfalls are found in areas with bands of hard and soft rock (otherwise known as resistant and less resistant rocks). The hard rock takes longer to erode than the soft rock (differential erosion) so the river erodes the land at different rates.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-bottom-of-a-waterfall-called>What is the bottom of a waterfall called?</h2>
<p>A plunge pool (or plunge basin or waterfall lake) is a deep depression in a stream bed at the base of a waterfall or shut-in. The term may refer to the water occupying the depression, or the depression itself.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-waterfalls-in-any-part-of-the-river>Are there waterfalls in any part of the river?</h2>
<p>Waterfalls, then, can exist in any part of a river where the erosion has been massive enough to allow the water of the river to fall. Start your 48-hour free trial and unlock all the summaries, Q&A, and analyses you need to get better grades now.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-v-shaped-valley-a-waterfall>What makes a V shaped valley a waterfall?</h2>
<p>Waterfall – often occur where the river crosses a band of harder rock. V-shaped valley – produced in the upper course because the river cuts down faster than the surrounding slopes are eroded. Meander – the river starts to erode from side to side. River cliff – the river moves faster on the outside of the bend and cuts into the valley side.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-a-waterfall-to-form-in-a-river>What causes a waterfall to form in a river?</h2>
<p>Waterfalls are very erosive. The power with which the water pours over a waterfall continually erodes away at both the material the water pours past and the material the water lands upon. “Blockage of a preexisting channel” can cause waterfalls to form.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-caused-by-the-wearing-back-of-a-waterfall>Which is caused by the wearing back of a waterfall?</h2>
<p>Gorge – a deep valley caused by the wearing back of a waterfall. Waterfall – often occur where the river crosses a band of harder rock. V-shaped valley – produced in the upper course because the river cuts down faster than the surrounding slopes are eroded.</p>
