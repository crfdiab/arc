<h2 id=what-did-william-r-davie-do>What did William R Davie do?</h2>
<p>William Richardson Davie, statesman, Revolutionary War officer, and founder of The University of North Carolina, was born in the parish of Egremont, County Cumberland, England.</p>
<h2 id=was-william-r-davie-a-federalist>Was William R Davie a federalist?</h2>
<p>He was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons on multiple occasions from 1786 through 1798. After his return to North Carolina, Davie continued to be active in Federalist politics. He ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives against Willis Alston in the 1804 election.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-north-carolina-feel-about-the-issue-of-representation-in-congress>How did North Carolina feel about the issue of representation in Congress?</h2>
<p>He was a member of the committee that considered the question of representation in Congress and swung the North Carolina delegation’s vote in favor of the Great Compromise. He favored election of senators and presidential electors by the legislature and insisted on counting slaves in determining representation.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-william-blount-believe-in>What did William Blount believe in?</h2>
<p>Â The first was western lands; like many businessmen of his day, Blount believed the future of the new nation lay beyond the Appalachian Mountains so he accumulated as much western land as possible. Â The other obsession was public office. As early as 1780 he served in the state legislature.</p>
<h2 id=did-alexander-martin-sign-the-articles-of-confederation>Did Alexander Martin sign the Articles of Confederation?</h2>
<p>In 1787, the General Assembly elected him delegate to the Federal Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, where the difficulties of the U.S. government under the Articles of Confederation would be weighed. Because Martin left the Federal Convention early, he did not sign the Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-william-blount-important>Why is William Blount important?</h2>
<p>William Blount, (born March 26, 1749, Bertie County, N.C.—died March 21, 1800, Knoxville, Tenn., U.S.), first territorial governor of (1790–96) and later one of the first two U.S. senators from Tennessee (1796–97). Later he was a member of the North Carolina convention that ratified the Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-william-blount-expelled-from-the-senate>Why was William Blount expelled from the Senate?</h2>
<p>His risky land investments left him in debt, and in the 1790s, he conspired with Great Britain to seize the Spanish-controlled Louisiana in the hope of boosting western land prices. When the conspiracy was uncovered in 1797, he was expelled from the Senate and became the first federal official to face impeachment.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-john-davie-do-at-the-constitutional-convention>What did John Davie do at the Constitutional Convention?</h2>
<p>During the Constitutional Convention, Davie favored plans for a strong central government. He was a member of the committee that considered the question of representation in Congress and swung the North Carolina delegation’s vote in favor of the Great Compromise.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-john-davie-leave-the-north-carolina-convention>When did John Davie leave the North Carolina convention?</h2>
<p>Though he left the convention on August 13, before its adjournment, Davie fought hard for the Constitution’s ratification and took a prominent part in the North Carolina convention. The political and military realms were not the only ones in which Davie left his mark.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-general-davie-wounded-in-north-carolina>When was general Davie wounded in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>While attached to Pulaski’s division, Davie was wounded leading a charge at Stono, near Charleston, on June 20, 1779. Early in 1780 he raised another troop and operated mainly in western North Carolina. In January 1781 Davie was appointed commissary-general for the Carolina campaign.</p>
