<h2 id=what-can-i-use-for-a-time-capsule>What can I use for a time capsule?</h2>
<p>Materials for a time capsule:</p>
<ol>
<li>An airtight plastic box.</li>
<li>Plastic garbage bags or resealable bags.</li>
<li>Old thermoses, school lunch containers, or even that dented metal water bottle that you no longer carry around; if the seal is good, it’ll be durable underground but you may still want to put items in a sealed plastic bag.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-is-time-capsule-made-of>What is time capsule made of?</h2>
<p>Canisters can be made of copper, aluminum, stainless steel or large diameter polyethylene pipe. Sheet metal fabricators can make stainless steel cylinders. A metal time capsule ideally should be seamless although it could also be welded.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-material-for-a-time-capsule>What is the best material for a time capsule?</h2>
<p>Polypropylene, aluminum, and stainless steel are currently considered as acceptable capsule structure materials. Seals are critical; butyl or propylene gaskets are currently favored. Tip #6—Include items that do not require any technology or equipment other than the eye and hand to use and interpret.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-have-to-bury-a-time-capsule>Do I have to bury a time capsule?</h2>
<p>Time Capsules May Not Be The Best Idea Some experts think burial is a risky way to try to preserve items. Nevertheless, the process of choosing items to save in a time capsule can bring people together in positive ways, provide a valuable learning experience and demonstrate ways that items have meaning.</p>
<h2 id=where-should-i-bury-my-time-capsule>Where should I bury my time capsule?</h2>
<p>Where to place? Decide where you want to put it. Traditionally, people buried time capsules in their garden or beneath a new building that was being built in the local area. This is a good option if you want strangers to stumble upon it in the future, or if you’re putting together a time capsule with a community group.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-time-capsule-have-to-be-buried>Does a time capsule have to be buried?</h2>
<p>Seal the capsule inside a 6-mil (0.006 inch) polyethylene bag or wrapping to further protect against water infiltration. If buried, the capsule should be at least three feet below the surface to protect against wide fluctuations in temperature.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-you-keep-a-time-capsule>How long do you keep a time capsule?</h2>
<p>Method 2 of 4: For a personal time capsule, 10 to 30 years may be enough, whereas a generational time capsule meant for your grandchildren may need to last 60 to 70 years. If you want your capsule to be opened at an even later date, you will want to start planning the logistics.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-bury-my-time-capsule>Where can I bury my time capsule?</h2>
<p>With care, items can be preserved in home living areas and closets. Attics and basements may subject items to harmful extremes in temperature and humidity. Some experts think burial is a risky way to try to preserve items.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-make-a-time-capsule-for-kids>How do you make a time capsule for kids?</h2>
<p>In order to make your time capsule, first you’ll have to choose a container in which to store it. Choosing your container depends on how long you are planning on keeping it hidden. This is a great opportunity for your little ones to get involved. Have them pick out the box or help them decorate the box before it’s filled.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-time-capsules>What do you need to know about time capsules?</h2>
<p>Time capsules are fun to make, and even more fun to open years down the line. A time capsule can be any container that holds objects meant for people to open in the future, whether that be in 5, 10, or even 100 years. A good time capsule will hold its contents safely, preserving them for a future version of yourself,…</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-recover-a-time-capsule>How long does it take to recover a time capsule?</h2>
<p>Set a retrieval date 10 to 50 years from the time of storage, when the capsule will be recovered. Or, you can leave it longer for future generations to open. Choose a container. For a time capsule to be retrieved after 25 years or less, use a metal lunchbox and seal the lid shut with epoxy glue.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-best-place-to-hide-a-time-capsule>Where is the best place to hide a time capsule?</h2>
<p>An attic, basement or garage are also great locations. You want to hide your time capsule somewhere where others will not find it! For outdoor safekeeping, consider a weatherproof, non-biodegradable container such as an old metal coffee can, popcorn can or a box made of stainless steel.</p>
