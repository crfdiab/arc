<p>1862<br>
Pasteurization is the name of the process discovered in part by the French microbiologist Louis Pasteur. This process was first used in 1862 and involves heating milk to a particular temperature for a set amount of time in order to remove microorganisms.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-louis-pasteur-come-up-with-pasteurization>How did Louis Pasteur come up with pasteurization?</h2>
<p>Invention of the Pasteurization Process Pasteur’s experiments with germs and wine revealed a direct cause-and-effect relationship between bacteria and the souring of wine into vinegar. Subsequently, he invented a process by which bacteria could be killed by heating the wine between 60 and 100° C, then letting it cool.</p>
<h2 id=who-invented-pasteurization-in-1862>Who invented pasteurization in 1862?</h2>
<p>In 1862, a French chemist named Louis Pasteur discovered that heat kills germs in liquids, preventing bacterial growth, food spoilage and foodborne illnesses. He used his discovery to invent methods that have been used for the last 150 years as a sanitary treatment for milk – which at the time was a prime source of TB.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-pasteurization-and-in-which-year>Who discovered pasteurization and in which year?</h2>
<p>He then invented a process where bacteria could be removed by boiling and then cooling liquid. He completed the first test on April 20, 1862. Today the process is known as pasteurization. Shifting focus, in 1865, Pasteur helped save the silk industry.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-drinking-raw-milk-illegal>Why is drinking raw milk illegal?</h2>
<p>The federal government banned the sale of raw milk across state lines nearly three decades ago because it poses a threat to public health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association all strongly advise people not to drink it.</p>
<h2 id=did-louis-pasteur-invent-pasteurization>Did Louis Pasteur invent pasteurization?</h2>
<p>Louis Pasteur is best known for inventing the process that bears his name, pasteurization. In his work with silkworms, Pasteur developed practices that are still used today for preventing disease in silkworm eggs.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-pasteurization-get-its-name>How did pasteurization get its name?</h2>
<p>The process was named after the French microbiologist, Louis Pasteur, whose research in the 1860s demonstrated that thermal processing would deactivate unwanted microorganisms in wine. Spoilage enzymes are also inactivated during pasteurization.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-pasteurization-first-used-for>What was pasteurization first used for?</h2>
<p>Pasteurization was originally used as a way of preventing wine and beer from souring, and it would be many years before milk was pasteurized. In the United States in the 1870s, before milk was regulated, it was common for milk to contain substances intended to mask spoilage.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-louis-pasteur-invent-the-pasteurization-process>How did Louis Pasteur invent the pasteurization process?</h2>
<p>Pasteurization, heat-treatment process that destroys pathogenic microorganisms in certain foods and beverages. It is named for the French scientist Louis Pasteur, who in the 1860s demonstrated that abnormal fermentation of wine and beer could be prevented by heating the beverages to about 57 °C (135 °F) for a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-pasteurization-of-milk-made>When was the first pasteurization of milk made?</h2>
<p>The first commercial milk pasteurizers were produced in 1882, using a high-temperature, short-time ( HTST) process. The first law to require the pasteurization of milk was passed in Chicago in 1908 [source: Sun ].</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-louis-pasteur-when-he-died>How old was Louis Pasteur when he died?</h2>
<p>Louis Pasteur (/ˈluːi pæˈstɜːr/, French: [lwi pastœʁ]; December 27, 1822 – September 28, 1895) was a French biologist, microbiologist and chemist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation and pasteurization.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-pasteurization-used-in-the-food-industry>How is pasteurization used in the food industry?</h2>
<p>Today, pasteurization is used widely in the dairy industry and other food processing industries to achieve food preservation and food safety. Most liquid products are heat treated in a continuous system where heat can be applied using a plate heat exchanger and/or the direct or indirect use of hot water and steam.</p>
