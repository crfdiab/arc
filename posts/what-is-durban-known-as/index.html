<h2 id=what-is-durban-known-as>What is Durban known as?</h2>
<p>Durban, otherwise known as eThekwini, is recognised as the largest city in KwaZulu-Natal and is famous for being the busiest port in South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-durban-nickname>What is Durban nickname?</h2>
<p>Durbs. Durban. The second largest city in South Africa is home to the ideal surfer and laid back lifestyle. Durbs is short and sweet but let that not fool you as everyone has a slow and mellow feel – it may be the ocean breeze or the sand between their toes but Durbs is a perfect name.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-durban>Who discovered Durban?</h2>
<p>Vasco da Gama<br>
In 1497 when the famous Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, discovered Durban, Durban was populated by many African tribes. Originally, the Lala tribe and Luthuli clan lived in this area. In Zulu, this area is called Thekweni, “Place of the Bay”.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-durban-south-africa-get-its-name>How did Durban South Africa get its name?</h2>
<p>Durban. Durban was founded in 1835 on the site of Port Natal and was named for Sir Benjamin D’Urban, the governor of the Cape Colony. In the late 1830s and early ’40s the Boers clashed with the British over control of Durban. It became a borough (town) in 1854 and was created a city in 1935.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-founder-of-the-durban-colony>Who was the founder of the Durban Colony?</h2>
<p>European settlement began with a band of Cape Colony traders led by Francis G. Farewell, who charted the port in 1824 and named the site Port Natal. Land was ceded to the group by Shaka, the Zulu king (whose right to take that action is disputed), and the Old Fort (now a museum) was built.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-durban-so-important-to-south-africa>Why is Durban so important to South Africa?</h2>
<p>Tourism is important and is based on the city’s proximity to KwaZulu-Natal’s game and nature reserves and on the beaches and their facilities, such as an esplanade and an oceanarium. Durban (with adjacent Pinetown) has a larger Indian population than white; the area contains one of the largest concentrations of Indians in South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-durban-become-a-major-commercial-port>When did Durban become a major commercial port?</h2>
<p>Development of Durban’s harbour, one of the world’s major commercial ports, began in 1855. Serving the Witwatersrand industrial region, it is a major container port and point of entry for bulk raw materials, capital goods, and industrial equipment.</p>
