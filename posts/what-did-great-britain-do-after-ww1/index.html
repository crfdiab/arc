<h2 id=what-did-great-britain-do-after-ww1>What did Great Britain do after ww1?</h2>
<p>The British Empire England had ruled them for the next 700 years. After 1918 Britain gained territory from Germany in Africa making British rule continuous from Cape Town to the Suez Canal and they promptly built a railway northwards to the Mediterranean to prove it.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-great-britain-want-to-gain-from-ww1>What did Great Britain want to gain from ww1?</h2>
<p>When Britain entered the First World War its war aims were simple: to restore Belgian sovereignty (as it was obliged to do, by the Treaty of London, 1839), and to maintain the balance of power in Europe by defending France and chastening Germany. Britain’s permanent war aims did not change.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-achieved-after-ww1>What was achieved after ww1?</h2>
<p>After the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919, between Germany on the one side and France, Italy, Britain and other minor allied powers on the other, officially ended war between those countries.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-britain-after-the-war>What happened to Britain after the war?</h2>
<p>Britain suffered 264,433 military and 60,595 civilian deaths during the war. This period saw the end of the British Empire. Its standing in the world had declined as it became impossible to contend with the economic might of the USA. Wartime rationing had to be continued due to shortages of food and raw materials.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-political-impact-of-ww1-on-britain>What was the political impact of ww1 on Britain?</h2>
<p>The war heralded seismic political shifts: the collapse of the Liberal Party, the rise of Labour and Britain’s first near-democratic franchise. ‘coupon election’ of December 1918 thus charged itself with the task of creating a ‘land fit for heroes’.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-world-war-1-important-to-britain>Why was World War 1 important to Britain?</h2>
<p>World War One determined the timing of democratic change. What mattered more by then was the fact that the country was engaged in the greatest war of modern times, one in which Britain’s military deaths were more than twice those it would suffer in World War Two. World War One may not have initiated democratic change, but it determined its timing.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-britain-after-world-war-1>What was life like in Britain after World War 1?</h2>
<p>Britain after the war. Vast crowds gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square to celebrate the victorious end of the First World War on 11 November 1918. However, the joyous mood was short-lived. Post-war Britain, as many contemporary observers noted, did not seem like a country that had just experienced a great military triumph.</p>

<p>The National Archives> Exhibitions> First World War Britain after the war Vast crowds gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square to celebrate the victorious end of the First World War on 11 November 1918. However, the joyous mood was short-lived.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-british-navy-like-before-world-war-1>What was the British navy like before World War 1?</h2>
<p>In the years before World War I, the superiority of Britain’s Royal Navy was unchallenged by any other nation’s fleet, but the Imperial German Navy had made substantial strides in closing the gap between the two naval powers.</p>
