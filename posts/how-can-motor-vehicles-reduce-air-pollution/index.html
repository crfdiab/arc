<h2 id=how-can-motor-vehicles-reduce-air-pollution>How can motor vehicles reduce air pollution?</h2>
<p>Follow these tips to reduce the time you spend driving:</p>
<ol>
<li>Walk or bike when you can.</li>
<li>Use the bike-share programs if your city or town has them.</li>
<li>Take public transit when possible.</li>
<li>Carpool with friends instead of driving alone.</li>
<li>Use ride-sharing services.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-can-we-reduce-the-air-pollution>How can we reduce the air pollution?</h2>
<p>Ways to Reduce Air Pollution</p>
<ol>
<li>Riding a bike or walking instead of driving.</li>
<li>Taking a bus or carpooling.</li>
<li>Buying a car that has greater fuel efficiency.</li>
<li>Turning off lights and appliances when they are not in use.</li>
<li>Using energy efficient light bulbs and appliances.</li>
<li>Buying fewer things that are manufactured using fossil fuels.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-can-we-reduce-pollution-from-cars>How can we reduce pollution from cars?</h2>
<p>Everyone can take steps to reduce vehicle pollution</p>
<ol>
<li>Ride a bike or walk. If you are only going a short distance, consider riding a bike or walking instead of driving.</li>
<li>Take public transit.</li>
<li>Carpool.</li>
<li>Avoid idling.</li>
<li>Use alternative fuels.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=which-energy-can-be-used-to-control-air-pollution>Which energy can be used to control air pollution?</h2>
<p>Power plants reduce air pollution emissions in various ways Burning low-sulfur-content coal to reduce SO2 emissions. Some coal-fired power plants cofire wood chips with coal to reduce SO2 emissions. Pretreating and processing coal can also reduce the level of undesirable compounds in combustion gases.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-vehicles-pollute-the-air>How do vehicles pollute the air?</h2>
<p>Carbon monoxide- This odorless, colorless gas is formed by the combustion of fossil fuels such as gasoline. Cars and trucks are the source of nearly two-thirds of this pollutant. Hazardous air pollutants- These chemical compounds, which are emitted by cars, trucks, refineries, gas pumps, and related sources.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-protect-from-pollution>How can we protect from pollution?</h2>
<p>On Days when High Particle Levels are Expected, Take these Extra Steps to Reduce Pollution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce the number of trips you take in your car.</li>
<li>Reduce or eliminate fireplace and wood stove use.</li>
<li>Avoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials.</li>
<li>Avoid using gas-powered lawn and garden equipment.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=are-cars-bad-for-pollution>Are cars bad for pollution?</h2>
<p>Road transport is a major source of air pollution that harms human health and the environment. Vehicles emit a range of pollutants including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM).</p>
<h2 id=how-are-catalytic-converters-used-to-reduce-air-pollution>How are catalytic converters used to reduce air pollution?</h2>
<p>Catalytic converters only work when they are hot, so a lot of exhaust escapes as the car is warming up. Catalytic converters are placed on modern cars in the United States. Making a vehicle more fuel efficient. Lighter more streamlined vehicles need less energy. Hybrid vehicles have an electric motor and a rechargeable battery.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-cars-helping-to-reduce-air-pollution>How are cars helping to reduce air pollution?</h2>
<p>Reducing air pollution from vehicles can be done in a number of ways. Breaking down pollutants before they are released into the atmosphere. Motor vehicles emit less pollution than they once did because of catalytic converters ( Figure below ).</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-united-states-reducing-air-pollution>How is the United States reducing air pollution?</h2>
<p>Increasing our use of renewable energy and decreasing our use of coal-powered electricity, increasing alternative transportation such as hybrid/electric vehicles and adding catalytic converters to automobiles has reduced acid deposition in the United States. Q. What is a primary pollutant?</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-fuel-cells-that-produce-no-pollution>Are there any fuel cells that produce no pollution?</h2>
<p>Fuel cells are extremely efficient and they produce no pollutants. But developing fuel-cell technology has had many problems and no one knows when or if they will become practical. A hydrogen fuel-cell car looks like a gasoline-powered car.</p>
