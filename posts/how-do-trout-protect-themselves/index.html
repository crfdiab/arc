<h2 id=how-do-trout-protect-themselves>How do trout protect themselves?</h2>
<p>In rivers, trout are territorial and will often chase away other trout from their feeding lies and bolt holes. In lakes, where there is no localised “preferred area” to defend, trout are less aggressive.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-brook-trout-survive>How does the brook trout survive?</h2>
<p>Arguably the most beautiful freshwater fish, brook trout survive in only the coldest and cleanest water. Some states have anadromous populations, called salters that spend most of their adult life in salt water and return to fresh only to spawn.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-brook-trout-help-the-environment>How do brook trout help the environment?</h2>
<p>Brook trout are an incredibly important part of their ecosystems. In the absence of predatory and non-native fish (such as brown trout), brook trout are the primary predatory fish in the ecosystems of mountain streams. They are able to prey on nearly any living organism of appropriate size.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-brook-trout-do>What does the brook trout do?</h2>
<p>During the day, brook trout may retreat to deeper waters. These fish are extremely opportunistic and eat a variety of insects, often preferring adult and nymph forms of aquatic insects. They will also eat beetles, ants, and small fish when they’re available. Brook trout spawn in the fall and hatching occurs in January.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-good-size-brook-trout>What is a good size brook trout?</h2>
<p>SIZE: Common length for brook trout is 24.6 cm (10.4 in) with the maximum reported length Being 86 cm (33.9 in) . RANGE: Brook trout are native to eastern Canada and the northeastern United States.</p>
<h2 id=do-trout-remember-being-caught>Do trout remember being caught?</h2>
<p>We’ve found through our studies that fish do have a memory. “For example, if a bass is caught on a spinnerbait one day, it’s almost impossible to catch that fish on the same lure the next day. But once the fish have been exposed to lures day after day, they remember and become warier.”</p>
<h2 id=is-it-bad-to-hold-trout>Is it bad to hold trout?</h2>
<p>In addition, handle the fish with care, and do not grab the fish by the mouth or gills. Instead, cup your hands under the main body of the fish, and control the tail of the fish (at the base) if the fish is larger. NEVER squeeze the fish, as this may damage internal organs or fins.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-rainbow-trout-ever-caught>What is the biggest rainbow trout ever caught?</h2>
<p>The world record rainbow trout title belongs to Canadian fisher Sean Konrad. The International Game Fish Association’s (IGFA) record book now lists his 48-pound, 42-inch catch as the biggest ever rainbow trout specimen – a true world record trout.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-brook-trout>What do you need to know about brook trout?</h2>
<p>Large numbers of brook trout found in a stream indicate a healthy environment while a decline indicates deteriorating habitat and poor water quality. The brook trout has a dark green to brown color with a distinctive light marbled pattern across the sides and back extending at least to the dorsal (back) fin and often to the tail.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-cover-does-a-brook-trout-need>What kind of cover does a brook trout need?</h2>
<p>This small, colorful trout prefers cover such as boulders and logs, where it is protected from strong currents and predators. Brook trout need high quality water and are sensitive to low oxygen, pollution, and changes in pH. Warm summer temperatures and low water flow rates stress brook trout, especially larger fish.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-brook-trout-endangered-in-north-america>Why are brook trout endangered in North America?</h2>
<p>Conservation status. The brown trout, a species not native to North America, has replaced the brook trout in much of the brook trout’s native water. Brook trout populations, if already stressed by overharvest or by temperature, are very susceptible to damage by the introduction of exogenous species.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-brook-trout-restored-in-the-adirondack-park>How are brook trout restored in the Adirondack Park?</h2>
<p>To counteract the impacts of non-native fish introductions and acid precipitation, DEC has an active brook trout restoration program in the Adirondack Park. Ponds are selectively limed each winter to reduce acidity levels, and non-native fish populations that compete with brook trout are eliminated.</p>
