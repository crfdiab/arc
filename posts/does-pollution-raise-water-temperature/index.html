<h2 id=does-pollution-raise-water-temperature>Does pollution raise water temperature?</h2>
<p>Air and Water Temperature Increases An increase in the air temperature will cause water temperatures to increase as well. Increases in concentrations of some pollutants such as ammonia and pentachlorophenol due to their chemical response to warmer temperatures. Increase in algal blooms (Photo of algal blooms).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-sources-of-thermal-water-pollution>What are some sources of thermal water pollution?</h2>
<p>What are the sources of thermal pollution? The major sources of thermal pollution are heated waste water produced from production and manufacturing plants – coal fired thermal power plants, natural gas plants, nuclear plants, textiles, paper and pulp industries, etc.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-cause-pollution-to-waterways>What can cause pollution to waterways?</h2>
<p>Causes of water pollution</p>
<ul>
<li>spills or leaks from oil and chemical containers.</li>
<li>trade effluent going into surface water drains instead of foul water drains, or straight into watercourses.</li>
<li>removing too much water from surface waters and groundwater.</li>
<li>run-off containing fertilisers and pesticides from farming into surface waters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-water-temperature-and-oxygen-amounts>What is the relationship between water temperature and oxygen amounts?</h2>
<p>The amount of oxygen in water affects the life it can support. The warmer the water, the less dissolved oxygen it can hold. Some fish, such as trout, need cold water with high levels of dissolved oxygen. They cannot live in warmer water.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-thermal-pollution-affect-bodies-of-water>How does thermal pollution affect bodies of water?</h2>
<p>Simply put, thermal pollution comes from hot water or cold water being dumped into a body of water. Bodies of water naturally tend to dissipate the heat gained from warm currents, underwater hot springs, and from the sun. Thermal pollution is called that because it overwhelms the natural temperature control mechanisms that work in the water.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-and-effects-of-water-pollution>What are the causes and effects of water pollution?</h2>
<p>What Are the Causes of Water Pollution? Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-hot-water-bad-for-the-environment>Why is hot water bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>This is because when very hot water coming from power plants and industries is discharged into a river or lake, it raises the temperature of the river water (or lake water). This rise in the temperature of river water (or lake water) has an adverse effect on the animals and plants living in it.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-retention-ponds-a-source-of-thermal-pollution>Why are retention ponds a source of thermal pollution?</h2>
<p>Water on hot paved surfaces gets hot, then runs off into nearby bodies of water, raising the water temperature. Retention ponds can also be a source of thermal shock because the relatively small and shallow bodies of water can absorb quite a bit of heat energy from the sun.</p>
