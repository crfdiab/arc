<h2 id=how-are-volcanoes-different-from-landslides>How are volcanoes different from landslides?</h2>
<p>Volcanoes have unstable surfaces, so landslides are likely even when the volcano is dormant. In addition to the fact that the surface is composed mostly of loose rock, the volcanic gases create acidic groundwater. This contributes to the rocks’ breakdown, making them more likely to be carried away.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-volcanoes-form-at-rift-valleys>How do volcanoes form at rift valleys?</h2>
<p>Rift volcanoes form when magma rises into the gap between diverging plates. They thus occur at or near actual plate boundaries. Earthquake swarms and volcanic eruptions occur when the stretching exceeds the strength of the near-surface rocks, which then fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-volcanoes-and-how-are-they-different>What are the different types of volcanoes and how are they different?</h2>
<p>There are three main types of volcano – composite or strato, shield and dome. Composite volcanoes, sometimes known as strato volcanoes, are steep sided cones formed from layers of ash and [lava] flows. Eruptions are explosive due to the thick, highly viscous lava that is produced by composite cone volcanoes.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-canyon-and-a-valley>What’s the difference between a canyon and a valley?</h2>
<p>This deep depression between two cliffs of a mountain is referred to as a canyon. It is also called a deep valley carved out of a mountain by a river. In case of both a valley and a canyon, a deep depression is made in a mountain that goes down to the bottom of the mountain with a U or V shape being formed on…</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-different-types-of-volcanoes-different>How are the different types of volcanoes different?</h2>
<p>Volcanoes erupt in different ways, producing different landforms. Steep, cone-shaped volcanoes form when plates collide. All the pressure and heat of the collision make for a violent eruption. The cone forms when lava and other material eject and build up around the opening.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-valleys-formed-and-how-are-they-formed>How are valleys formed and how are they formed?</h2>
<p>Valleys These geological formations are created by running rivers and shifting glaciers. Valleys are depressed areas of land–scoured and washed out by the conspiring forces of gravity, water, and ice. Some hang; others are hollow.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-area-around-a-volcano>What happens to the area around a volcano?</h2>
<p>During such an eruption, many previously safe areas turn into high and extreme risk zones. Volcanic mud flows (lahars) are capable of traveling many tens of km down through valleys on the side of volcanoes and onto plains.</p>
