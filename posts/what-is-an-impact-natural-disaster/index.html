<p>Human-Caused disasters have an element of human intent, negligence, or error involving a failure of a man-made system, as opposed to natural disasters resulting from natural hazards.

<h2 id=are-there-any-natural-disasters-in-east-africa>Are there any natural disasters in East Africa?</h2>
<p>Here are the top 10 most fatal natural disasters that have shaken some parts of the African continent. A persistent absence of rain which began in late 2010 took its toll when between July 2011 and mid-2012, a severe and massive drought affected the entire East Africa region, specifically in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-causes-and-effects-of-natural-disasters>What are the causes and effects of natural disasters?</h2>
<p>Soil erosion can lead to a high level of degradation of land, which in turn can lead to a loss in fertility and thus to famine for local populations. Soil erosion can also cause landslides which can cause serious damage to nature as well as to humans. The seismic activities inside our earth can cause earthquakes.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-worst-natural-disaster-in-mozambique>What was the worst natural disaster in Mozambique?</h2>
<p>The flood caused the loss of about 500 lives and more than 6,000 people displaced or evacuated.

The floods in Mozambique took place in the early months of 2000.</p>
