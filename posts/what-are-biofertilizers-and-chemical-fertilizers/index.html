<h2 id=what-are-biofertilizers-and-chemical-fertilizers>What are biofertilizers and chemical fertilizers?</h2>
<p>Biofertilizer is a natural product carrying living microorganisms derived from the root or cultivated soil. Biofertilizers can be expected to reduce the use of chemical fertilizer and pesticides. The microorganisms in biofertilizers restore the soil’s natural nutrient cycle and build soil organic matter.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-difference-between-organic-manure-and-chemical-fertilizers>What are the difference between organic manure and chemical fertilizers?</h2>
<p>State the differences between manure and fertilizer. Manure is an organic substance that is obtained from decomposition of vegetables and animal waste. Fertilizers are inorganic substances manufactured in factories. Manures are relatively less rich in plant nutrients, they only remove general deficiency of soil.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-chemical-fertilizers-and-pesticides>What is the difference between chemical fertilizers and pesticides?</h2>
<p>Pesticides are additives applied to the plants to remove pests and improve stability and growth, whereas fertilizers are additives applied to the soil to improve its stability and growth.</p>
<h2 id=are-biofertilizers-costly>Are biofertilizers costly?</h2>
<p>Biofertilizers are low-cost, renewable sources of plant nutrients.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-examples-of-chemical-fertilizers>What are the examples of chemical fertilizers?</h2>
<p>Some examples of chemical fertilizers are ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, urea, ammonium chloride and the like. Organic fertilizers are substances that are derived from the remains or by products of organisms.</p>
<h2 id=is-manure-better-than-fertilizers>Is manure better than fertilizers?</h2>
<p>Manure is better than fertiliser. Manure is derived naturally and adds a lot more than just nutrients to the soil. They increase the activity of the microbes in the soil and increase its fertility.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-example-of-chemical-fertilizers>What is the example of chemical fertilizers?</h2>
<h2 id=why-is-chemical-fertilizer-bad>Why is chemical fertilizer bad?</h2>
<p>However, excessive use of chemical fertilizers has led to several issues such as serious soil degradation, nitrogen leaching, soil compaction, reduction in soil organic matter, and loss of soil carbon.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-biofertilizers>What are the disadvantages of biofertilizers?</h2>
<p>The disadvantages of biofertilizers</p>
<ul>
<li>Biofertilizers provide lower nutrient density than chemical fertilizers, so more product is often required for the same effect.</li>
<li>Biofertilizer production requires specific machinery.</li>
<li>Biofertilizers can be difficult to store and may have a much shorter shelf-life than chemical fertilizers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-biofertilizers>What is the advantages and disadvantages of biofertilizers?</h2>
<p>Biofertilizers restore normal fertility to the soil and make it biologically alive. They boost the amount of organic matter and improve soil texture and structure. The enhanced soil holds water better than before. Biofertilizers add valuable nutrients to the soil, especially nitrogen, proteins and vitamins.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-main-types-of-chemical-fertilizers>What are the three main types of chemical fertilizers?</h2>
<p>Chemical Fertilizers Types: 3 Types of Chemical Fertilizers</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nitrogenous Fertilizers:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phosphate Fertilizers:</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id=potassic-fertilizers-what-are-the-three-main-types-of-fertilizers>Potassic Fertilizers: What are the three main types of fertilizers?</h2>
<p>Types of fertilizer</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nitrogen fertilizers. Nitrate-based fertilizers are the most commonly used straight fertilizers in Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nitrogen fertilizers with inhibitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phosphorus fertilizers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potassium fertilizers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calcium, magnesium and sulphur Fertilizers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Micronutrient fertilizers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id=inhibitors-whats-the-difference-between-organic-and-chemical-fertilizer>Inhibitors. What’s the difference between organic and chemical fertilizer?</h2>
<p>(1) organic fertilizers contain a large amount of organic matter and have obvious effects of soil modification and fertilizer cultivation; Chemical fertilizers can only provide inorganic nutrients for crops, and long-term application will cause adverse effects on the soil, making the soil “more and more greedy”.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-bio-fertilizer-do-to-a-plant>What does bio fertilizer do to a plant?</h2>
<p>Biofertilizer is a substance which contains living microorganisms which, when applied to seed, plant surfaces, or soil, colonizes the rhizosphere or the interior of the plant and promotes growth by increasing the supply or availability of primary nutrients to the host plant.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-definition-of-chemical-fertilizer>Which is the best definition of chemical fertilizer?</h2>
<p>A chemical fertilizer is defined as any inorganic material of wholly or partially synthetic origin that is added to soil to sustain plant growth.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fertilizer-do-you-use-for-crops>What kind of fertilizer do you use for crops?</h2>
<p>Ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, urea, ammonium chloride and the like. Chemical fertilizers are rich equally in three essential nutrients that are needed for crops and always ready for immediate supply of nutrients to plants if situation demands.</p>
