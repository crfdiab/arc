<h2 id=what-is-the-dropout-rate-in-france>What is the dropout rate in France?</h2>
<p>At France’s open enrollment public universities, the first year dropout and failure rate is close to 50 percent—compared to just 8.4 percent at British institutions.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-problem-of-drop-outs-in-france>Is there a problem of drop outs in France?</h2>
<p>In France, about 100,000 students drop out of secondary school every year, leaving the education system without a diploma. This problem particularly affects schools located in underprivileged areas. The SIB would serve to finance the scale-up of a programme decreasing school dropout rates.</p>
<h2 id=what-ethnicity-is-most-likely-to-drop-out>What ethnicity is most likely to drop out?</h2>
<p>In 2019, the high school drop out rate for American Indian/Alaska Natives in the United States was 9.6 percent — the highest rate of any ethnicity.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-dropout-rate-in-europe>What is the dropout rate in Europe?</h2>
<p>The European Union, on average, has a dropout rate of 10.2%, with Spain and Romania leading the continent with the highest rates at 16% and 16.4% respectively (see chart below). Males are more likely to dropout than females (11.9% compared to 8.4%).</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-french-go-to-college>What percentage of French go to college?</h2>
<p>In 2019, Eurostat has shown that more of 80 percent of individuals aged 25 and over had attained a upper secondary or tertiary education in France.</p>
<h2 id=is-university-hard-in-france>Is university hard in France?</h2>
<p>And, as I was discovering, the French grading scale is inherently more rigorous than the American model because of the different nature of higher education. French students don’t apply to college.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-most-likely-to-dropout-of-high-school>Who is most likely to dropout of high school?</h2>
<p>The status dropout rate was higher for male 16- to 24-year-olds than for female 16- to 24-year-olds overall (6.2 vs. 4.4 percent) and within most racial/ethnic groups in 2018. Status dropout rates were higher for males than for females among those who were White (4.8 vs. 3.6 percent), Black (7.8 vs.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-has-the-highest-dropout-rate-2020>What country has the highest dropout rate 2020?</h2>
<p>The country with the highest school dropout rate is Malta, with 40.5%.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-the-french-drop>What do you need to know about the French drop?</h2>
<p>Learn more… The French Drop is a sleight of hand trick where you make a coin or another small object “disappear” when you transfer it between your hands. The trick of the French Drop is that the coin never leaves the hand it started in, but your audience won’t notice that you’re concealing it.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-in-france-when-no-one-stops>What to do in France when no one stops?</h2>
<p>If you want to cross and no one stops, you have to signal your intent, start moving but ensure they’ve seen you and are slowing down before you step out. On the other hand, French people are not backward in moving in on any available space on beaches, in the parks, on buses.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-expect-when-i-go-to-france>What should I expect when I go to France?</h2>
<p>Remember, that waiting staff in France go through lots of training about food and wine and normally are running around doing 30 things at once. They will get to you. They don’t expect big tips; most people usually round the bill up to the nearest euro – or few euros – depending on the level of service and food.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-move-to-the-south-of-france>Why do people move to the south of France?</h2>
<p>When people hear that you’re moving to the south of France there is often a perception that you’re dropping out, taking leave of the real world, where people have to do boring stuff like work, pay bills and live in places where it never seems to stop raining.</p>
