<h2 id=who-invaded-cuba-during-the-bay-of-pigs-invasion>Who invaded Cuba during the Bay of Pigs invasion?</h2>
<p>Fidel Castro<br>
On April 17, 1961, 1,400 Cuban exiles launched what became a botched invasion at the Bay of Pigs on the south coast of Cuba. In 1959, Fidel Castro came to power in an armed revolt that overthrew Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-us-respond-to-the-bay-of-pigs-invasion>How did the US respond to the Bay of Pigs invasion?</h2>
<p>In response, early in 1960 President Eisenhower authorized the CIA to recruit 1,400 Cuban exiles living in Miami and begin training them to overthrow Castro. In May 1960, Castro established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and the United States responded by prohibiting the importation of Cuban sugar.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-soldiers-died-at-the-bay-of-pigs>How many soldiers died at the Bay of Pigs?</h2>
<p>118 men<br>
The Bay of Pigs invasion ended not with a bang but with a flurry of final shots as the exiles ran out of ammunition. The brigade lost 118 men. They had killed more than 2,000 of Castro’s defenders, their countrymen. Fidel Castro with fellow revolutionary rebels in Cuba, 1959.</p>

<p>Before the break of dawn on April 15, 1961, a squadron of eight B-26 bombers piloted by Cuban exiles roared down a Nicaraguan airstrip on a secret mission. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and President John F. Kennedy hoped the Bay of Pigs Invasion would result in the overthrow of Cuban leader Fidel Castro.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-cia-fail-in-the-bay-of-pigs>Why did the CIA fail in the Bay of Pigs?</h2>
<p>When studying reconnaissance photographs, CIA analysts had failed to spot coral reefs in the shallow waters of the Bay of Pigs that impeded the progress of landing craft and disabled a pair of boats. In addition, one of the red signal lights carried by a frogman accidentally flickered offshore.</p>

<p>Bay of Pigs invasion: Kennedy’s Cuban catastrophe In 1961, US-backed exiles made a disastrous attempt to overthrow Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Mark White examines President Kennedy’s role in the Bay of Pigs invasion and asks, was his mishandling of the operation as excusable as his supporters would have us believe? Share on Facebook</p>
<h2 id=what-was-at-the-mouth-of-the-bay-of-pigs>What was at the mouth of the Bay of Pigs?</h2>
<p>There is little here apart from mosquitoes and a crocodile-infested swamp. The beach at Playa Giron, a village with a small airstrip at the mouth of the Bay of Pigs, was the invaders’ primary target. (To this day, it is referred to in Cuba as the Playa Giron invasion.)</p>
