<h2 id=can-you-get-in-trouble-for-shooting-a-buzzard>Can you get in trouble for shooting a buzzard?</h2>
<p>Because they are a federally protected species, it is illegal to harm or kill them, although property owners experiencing a vulture infestation may apply for a federal kill permit.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-fine-if-you-kill-a-buzzard>What is the fine if you kill a buzzard?</h2>
<p>In the US it is illegal to take, kill, or possess turkey vultures, their eggs, and any body parts including but not limited to their feathers; violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 for individuals or $200,000 for organizations, and/or a prison term of 1 year.</p>
<h2 id=are-buzzards-protected-by-law>Are Buzzards protected by law?</h2>
<p>Because both Black and Turkey vultures are federally protected migratory birds, a federal authorization (permit) is necessary to legally “take” them. However, a permit is not necessary to “harass” or otherwise disperse or discourage vultures from using areas where they may be a potential threat to livestock.</p>
<h2 id=are-black-vultures-protected-in-indiana>Are black vultures protected in Indiana?</h2>
<p>Farmers in southern Indiana say black vultures have been a growing threat to livestock, but — because they are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act — any use of lethal force against them requires a permit from the federal government.</p>
<h2 id=are-buzzards-dangerous>Are buzzards dangerous?</h2>
<p>Despite their intimidating presence, vultures are pretty harmless. They have no incentive to attack humans and they lack the physical attributes that could pose a threat. Although they are carnivorous, most vultures feed only on animals that are already dead.</p>
<h2 id=what-will-a-buzzard-not-eat>What will a buzzard not eat?</h2>
<p>Many people picture buzzards as dirty, nasty animals, but actually they are not. It is their food which is repulsive to most people, as they eat only dead and partially decomposed food.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-vultures-in-indiana>Are there any vultures in Indiana?</h2>
<p>Turkey vultures can be found year-round in Indiana today, although most of the individuals in this species shift further south for the winter.</p>
<h2 id=are-eagles-in-indiana>Are Eagles in Indiana?</h2>
<p>History in Indiana Bald eagles are found mostly along major rivers and other large bodies of water. Mid-winter bald eagle surveys conducted from 1979-2020 showed a dramatic increase in wintering eagles in the state. In 1985, the Indiana Nongame & Endangered Wildlife Program began the Bald Eagle Reintroduction Program.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-buzzards-hang-around>What does it mean when buzzards hang around?</h2>
<p>They are either waiting for a Turkey Vulture to sniff out food, and just killing time, or they are searching by sight, or they are waiting for a larger, perhaps dangerous, predator or scavenger on the ground to finish eating.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-spiritual-meaning-of-buzzards>What is the spiritual meaning of buzzards?</h2>
<p>Buzzards are a harbinger of death and destruction. However, Cooper (1982) points out that as scavengers, the “represent purification,” and thus are also positive symbols.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-buzzards-a-sign-of>What are buzzards a sign of?</h2>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-have-a-gun-in-indiana>Is it illegal to have a gun in Indiana?</h2>

<h2 id=how-to-become-a-gun-owner-in-indiana>How to become a gun owner in Indiana?</h2>

<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-own-a-suppressor-in-indiana>Is it legal to own a suppressor in Indiana?</h2>
<p>Indiana permits the ownership of all NFA items, provided they are legally owned pursuant to federal law. Suppressors may also be used while hunting. CLEOs are required to sign an application for the transfer of any item regulated under the NFA within 15 days if the applicant is not prohibited by law from receiving it.</p>
