<h2 id=how-do-rock-falls-occur>How do rock falls occur?</h2>
<p>Tectonic stresses and erosion cause granite rock to fracture. Rockfalls later occur along these fractures. Weathering loosens bonds that hold rocks in place. Triggering mechanisms like water, ice, earthquakes, and vegetation growth are among the final forces that cause unstable rocks to fall.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-volcanic-eruptions-cause-landslides>Why do volcanic eruptions cause landslides?</h2>
<p>Landslides are common on volcanic cones because they are tall, steep, and weakened by the rise and eruption of molten rock. Magma releases volcanic gases that partially dissolve in groundwater, resulting in a hot acidic hydrothermal system that weakens rock by altering minerals to clay.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-falling-rocks-called>What are falling rocks called?</h2>
<p>“A rockfall is a fragment of rock (a block) detached by sliding, toppling, or falling, that falls along a vertical or sub-vertical cliff, proceeds down slope by bouncing and flying along ballistic trajectories or by rolling on talus or debris slopes.” …</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-rock-falls>What are the effects of rock falls?</h2>
<p>Landslides: Human Health Effects Rockfall causes extraordinary amounts of monetary damage and death, the former mostly by impeded transportation and commerce due to blocked highways and waterways and the latter as direct casualties from falling rocks.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-possible-effects-of-rock-fall>What are the possible effects of rock fall?</h2>
<p>Rockfalls can be very dangerous depending on where they occur, the size of the rocks involved, and how fast the rocks fall or bounce downslope. When people, buildings, vehicles, or highways are in their path, these rockfall events can cause property loss, personal injury, or even loss of life.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-rock-falls-dangerous>Why are rock falls dangerous?</h2>
<h2 id=what-is-the-effect-of-rock-fall>What is the effect of rock fall?</h2>
<p>Rockfalls and Landslides When a rockfall occurs, it can cause substantial damage to roads and other transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, rockfalls can cause routes to be shut down entirely, potentially costing millions of dollars per event.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-volcanoes-erupt-in-the-first-place>Why do volcanoes erupt in the first place?</h2>
<p>How & why volcanoes erupt The short answer is that volcanoes erupt because of density and pressure beneath the earth. Volcanic eruptions are earth’s natural method of releasing its internal pressure and heat. Deep within the earth, conditions are so hot that some rocks melt slowly, becoming a thick flowing substance called magma.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-rockfalls-occur-in-rock-cut-slopes>Why do rockfalls occur in rock cut slopes?</h2>
<p>Rockfalls typically occur in rock cut slopes when rock blocks become dislodged by weather, flowing water, or due to the surrounding rocks and soil being eroded. Because of the irregular, unpredictable nature of rock joints and weathering patterns, rockfalls cannot be precisely predicted.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rock-is-formed-after-a-volcanic-eruption>What kind of rock is formed after a volcanic eruption?</h2>
<p>Tuff is a sedimentary rock formed by volcanic activity. It tends to form when erupting lavas are stiff and high in silica, which holds the volcanic gases in bubbles rather than letting them escape. The lava tends to fragment and explode into tiny pieces. After the ash falls, it may be reworked by rainfall and streams.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-explosivity-of-a-volcano-affect-it>How does the explosivity of a volcano affect it?</h2>
<p>The explosivity of an eruption depends on the composition of the magma. If magma is thin and runny, gases can escape easily from it. When this type of magma erupts, it flows out of the volcano. A good example is the eruptions at Hawaii’s volcanoes.</p>
