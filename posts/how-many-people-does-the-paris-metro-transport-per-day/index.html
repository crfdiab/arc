It is reputed as one of the best transport systems in terms of service density, frequency and safety. It has a daily ridership of approximately 7 million people. Operated by Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens (RATP), the metro is 214km-long and has 303 stations.</p>

<table><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Number of journeys in millions</th></tr><tr><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=does-paris-have-an-underground>Does Paris have an underground?</h2>
<p>Paris Metro (Métro in French, Subway or Underground in English) is the fastest way of getting around the city. The underground system has 16 interconnected lines and is also linked to the express train RER.</p>

<h2 id=how-many-stations-are-there-in-the-london-underground>How many stations are there in the London Underground?</h2>
<p>The Underground serves 270 stations and over 408 km of track. From 2006–2007 over 1 billion passengers used the underground. Underground train systems in other cities may be called metros (like the Tyne and Wear Metro in North East England) or subways ( Glasgow Subway in Scotland and in most of North America ).</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-metro-station-in-paris-built>When was the first metro station in Paris built?</h2>
<p>The famous Paris Metro was built in 1900 and carries over 6 million people every day. The network is so efficient that no station is more than 500 metres from any other station. Paris has one of the world’s largest networks of sewers covering 2,100 km and dating from the 13th century.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-delays-on-the-london-underground>Why are there so many delays on the London Underground?</h2>
<p>Because the underground is a very old system, engineering work is often needed and often causes delays. There can be other reasons as well, for example signal failures or other breakdowns. Customers can claim a refund if their tube journey is delayed for more than 15 minutes due to problems within the control of Transport For London.</p>
