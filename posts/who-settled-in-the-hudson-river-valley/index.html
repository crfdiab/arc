<h2 id=who-settled-in-the-hudson-river-valley>Who settled in the Hudson River Valley?</h2>
<p>Henry Hudson was a Dutch explorer who first sailed up the Hudson River in New York in 1609 with a crew that included Robert Juet, whose journal of the experience survives. Hudson was followed by Dutch traders, who settled in the region due to its abundance of animal fur and other natural resources.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-colonists-use-the-hudson-river>How did colonists use the Hudson River?</h2>
<p>In Colonial times, the river supported a lucrative fur trade and conveyed Hudson Valley wheat and timber to New York City from where it was distributed throughout the western world. For more than 200 years, sloop-rigged sailing craft carried the bulk of the commerce on the Hudson River.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-hudson-river-so-toxic>Why is the Hudson River so toxic?</h2>
<p>It’s honestly just common sense to not take a dip in the Hudson River. It’s polluted with PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls — which are man-made chemicals), cadmium, sewage, urban runoff, heavy metals, pesticides, and lots and lots of bacteria. Also, dead bodies have been found in the river (this is a recent example).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-hudson-river>What is at the bottom of the Hudson River?</h2>
<p>Underneath the surface of the Hudson River Estuary exists a wide range of river-bottom habitats-from the shallow, muddy bottom in the Tappan Zee and other shallow near-shore areas, to the deep, sandy bottom in the navigation channel that runs north to Albany.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-poop-in-the-hudson-river>Is there poop in the Hudson River?</h2>
<p>Human poop, study shows. If you swim, kayak or hang out along the water’s edge of the Hudson,you may feel good about how far the river’s health has come since the days when Pete Seeger sang about “my dirty stream.” coli) bacteria — markers for, well, human poop.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-dutch-settle-in-the-hudson-river>Where did the Dutch settle in the Hudson River?</h2>
<p>As such, the Dutch established the colony of New Netherland. The Dutch settled three major outposts: New Amsterdam, Wiltwyck, and Fort Orange. New Amsterdam was founded at the mouth of the Hudson River, and would later become known as New York City. Wiltwyck was founded roughly halfway up the Hudson River between New Amsterdam and Fort Orange.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-hudson-river-important-to-new-york>Why was the Hudson River important to New York?</h2>
<p>Areas of the river here were dubbed World’s End and Devil’s Horse Race by the Dutch sailors. The 1600s saw the influx of colonists and the area, first known as New Amsterdam, became part of New York, controlled by Britain. As the quest for independence from the crown began to unfold, the Hudson River played a major role.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-dutch-colony-in-new-york>What was the name of the Dutch colony in New York?</h2>
<p>New Amsterdam and the overall colony of New Netherland was renamed New York, after the Duke of York. The Dutch regained New York temporarily, only to relinquish it again a few years later, thus ending Dutch control over New York and the Hudson River.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-hudson-river-valley-in-new-york>Where is the Hudson River valley in New York?</h2>
<p>The Hudson Valley (also known as the Hudson River Valley) comprises the valley of the Hudson River and its adjacent communities in the U.S. state of New York, from the cities of Albany and Troy southward to Yonkers in Westchester County.</p>
