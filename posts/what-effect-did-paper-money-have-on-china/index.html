<h2 id=what-effect-did-paper-money-have-on-china>What effect did paper money have on China?</h2>
<p>It started in Tang but not until Song dynasty that it became institutionized as a governmental policy. It had two main advantages over money made out of silver, gold, copper or iron: It was easier to carry around and the copper and iron could be saved for use in everyday objects.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-paper-money-impact-the-world>How did paper money impact the world?</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest impacts that the invention of paper money had in Asia was the diminishing value of bronze, copper, and iron coins. Once the Southern Song tied their paper notes to silver, the intrinsic value of metal coins declined, which resulted in much of those metals being exported to Japan.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-paper-money-help-the-economy>How does paper money help the economy?</h2>
<p>A Substitute for Value Printed paper money originally took the form of deposit receipts and ownership titles. People could then pass on those pieces of paper as payments to third parties. These exchanges facilitated commerce considerably and helped economies evolve beyond the barter system.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-chinese-give-up-paper-money>When did the Chinese give up paper money?</h2>
<p>By the 15th century even China had more or less given up paper money. Over this period, paper notes were issued irresponsibly, to the point that their value rapidly depreciated and inflation soared. Then beginning in 1455, the use of paper money in China disappeared for several hundred years.</p>

<p>Planet Money host Jacob Goldstein tells the story of how paper money came to be — and why it temporarily went away. For more than a thousand years, economies around the world operated on coins. Gold, silver, and bronze coins were the primary way people exchanged goods and services. Then in China, there was a breakthrough: Paper money.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-creation-of-paper-money-during-the-song-dynasty>How did the creation of paper money during the Song dynasty?</h2>
<p>The issuing of paper currency in Song China was as much of a process as the invention of paper currency itself. There was no single currency until the end of the dynasty, but instead, there were several currency zones throughout China.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-chinese-paper-money>What are the different types of Chinese paper money?</h2>
<p>The Bureau of Paper Currency in Kaifeng was established in 1154 as a central agency in charge of all Chin banknote issues. There were two kinds of paper banknotes: Large denominationsConsisted of one to ten strings, with each string worth 100 standard coins Small denominationsBore the amounts of 1 to 700 standard coins</p>
