<h2 id=what-id-does-a-child-need-to-fly-from-england-to-scotland>What ID does a child need to fly from England to Scotland?</h2>
<p>Passports and ID cards If you’re travelling on an international flight, you’ll need a passport or an equivalent travel document that is valid for the full duration of your trip. Your children will also need their own passports, even infants under two years.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-travel-restrictions-from-england-to-scotland>Are there travel restrictions from England to Scotland?</h2>
<p>General travel. Travel is allowed between Scotland and England, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. For restrictions on travel between Scotland and the rest of the world see the international travel section below.</p>
<h2 id=do-children-need-a-passport-to-fly-to-edinburgh>Do children need a passport to fly to Edinburgh?</h2>
<p>Travelling on domestic flights The passport seems like the best idea because it is a national identity document as well as a travel document. However, in such cases you can use a driving licence or an ID card. Children under the age of 16 years do not require identification to travel within the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-passport-to-fly-to-scotland>Do you need a passport to fly to Scotland?</h2>
<p>If you want to fly to Scotland without a passport, you may be able to use another form of photographic identification, such as a driving licence. You should check the airline’s website as each airline may accept different forms of identification and some may require a passport.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-passport-to-travel-between-ireland-and-the-uk>Do you need a passport to travel between Ireland and the UK?</h2>
<p>Although Irish and British citizens do not strictly require a passport to travel between the two countries, you will need some form of photographic identification. However, it is better to take your passport in case you’re asked for proof of nationality. The FCO advises: “Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-i-need-to-take-my-child-on-an-international-flight>What do I need to take my child on an international flight?</h2>
<p>Children’s identification on international flights Children travelling on international flights must have either a valid passport or EU National ID card. Restrictions apply for children of certain nationalities, or travelling to/from specific countries.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-get-a-passport-for-a-child>How old do you have to be to get a passport for a child?</h2>
<p>Restrictions apply for children of certain nationalities, or travelling to/from specific countries. For visa and passport requirements, contact the Consulate or Embassy of the country you are planning to visit. Children under 15 years MUST be accompanied by an adult aged 16 or over or they will be unable to travel.</p>
