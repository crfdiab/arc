<h2 id=which-location-is-a-source-of-magma>Which location is a source of magma?</h2>
<p>Magma forms above the subducting slab of oceanic crust and accumulates at the base of Earth’s rigid crust before collecting in a storage zone 13 km (8 mi) beneath the volcano prior to eruption.</p>
<h2 id=which-part-of-earth-is-magma-most-likely-to-form>Which part of Earth is magma most likely to form?</h2>
<p>Magma develops within the mantle or crust where the temperature and pressure conditions favor the molten state. After its formation, magma buoyantly rises toward the Earth’s surface, due to its lower density than the source rock.</p>
<h2 id=does-magma-come-from-the-core>Does magma come from the core?</h2>
<p>Molten material beneath the crust of the earth is called magma. When magma leaves the Earth’s crust through volcanic activity, it’s called lava. A common misconception is that magma comes from the Earth’s molten core. It really comes from the mantle, the layer between the core and the crust.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-magma-come-from-and-how-does-it-form>Where does magma come from and how does it form?</h2>
<p>Magma forms from partial melting of mantle rocks. As the rocks move upward (or have water added to them), they start to melt a little bit. These little blebs of melt migrate upward and coalesce into larger volumes that continue to move upward. They may collect in a magma chamber or they may just come straight up.</p>
<h2 id=will-the-earth-ever-run-out-of-magma>Will the Earth ever run out of magma?</h2>
<p>Since the lower mantle is the source of the magma, this means no more magma production. Though it will take a very long time for the earth to completely cool down. A billion years, if not more.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-magma-to-form>What causes magma to form?</h2>
<p>Differences in temperature, pressure, and structural formations in the mantle and crust cause magma to form in different ways. Decompression melting involves the upward movement of Earth’s mostly-solid mantle. This reduction in overlying pressure, or decompression, enables the mantle rock to melt and form magma.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-magma-form-on-the-earths-surface>Where does magma form on the earth’s surface?</h2>
<p>Magma is molten rock found below the earth’s surface. The temperature at which a rock melts is affected by its composition, pressure and water. Learn how magma forms and how it either feeds volcanoes or cools and crystallizes into igneous rock.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-flat-earth-or-magma-from-the-mantle>Is the flat earth or magma from the mantle?</h2>
<p>Magma is molten rock from the mantle. While flat Earth is fake as f***, magma could exist is both models. Yes, I agree magma is indeed molten rock from the mantle and could exist in both models, but I do see a potential problem. First off, how thick is the flat plane in the fet?</p>
<h2 id=how-is-magma-recycled-into-the-earths-mantle>How is magma recycled into the Earth’s mantle?</h2>
<p>As lava explodes from volcanoes or seeps up to fill rifts, it can seem inexhaustible. In a way, it is. At convergent plate boundaries, one plate can slide under another plate. The lower, or subducting, plate’s crust disappears into the Earth’s mantle. There, it gets recycled, becoming part of the mantle.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-magma-ocean-on-earth>How big is the magma ocean on Earth?</h2>
<p>Previous calculations suggested that Earth possessed one or more giant oceans of magma, or molten rock. For instance, after a Mars-size rock slammed into Earth about 4.5 billion years ago to create the moon, prior research suggested a magma ocean about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) deep covered most of Earth’s surface, according to prior research.</p>
