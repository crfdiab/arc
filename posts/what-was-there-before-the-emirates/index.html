<h2 id=what-was-there-before-the-emirates>What was there before the Emirates?</h2>
<p>The Emirates Stadium (known as Ashburton Grove prior to sponsorship, and as Arsenal Stadium for UEFA competitions) is a football stadium in Holloway, England, and the home of Arsenal. The club’s former stadium was redeveloped as Highbury Square, an apartment complex.</p>

<p>Highbury<br>
In November 1999, Arsenal decided to leave Highbury and construct a new 60,000-seat stadium in nearby Ashburton Grove. It was confirmed in October 2004 that the new stadium would be called the Emirates Stadium as part of a sponsorship deal with Emirates Airlines.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-game-at-the-emirates-stadium>When was the first game at the Emirates stadium?</h2>
<p>19 August 2006<br>
The first competitive game Arsenal’s first competitive match at the stadium was an FA Premier League game against Aston Villa on 19 August 2006, which ended 1-1. Aston Villa player Olof Mellberg scored the first goal of the game and thus the first Premiership goal at Emirates Stadium.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-arsenal-move-to-north-london>Why did Arsenal move to north London?</h2>
<p>Arsenal Football Club was founded in 1886 as a munition workers’ team from Woolwich, then in Kent, now southeast London. They were bought out by Sir Henry Norris that year and to improve the club’s financial standing, he moved the team to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, north London in 1913.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-emirates-stadium-opened-to-the-public>When was the Emirates Stadium opened to the public?</h2>
<p>The third event was Dennis Bergkamp’s testimonial match against Ajax on 22 July 2006. The Emirates Stadium was officially opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 26 October 2006; his wife Queen Elizabeth II had suffered a back injury and was unable to carry out her duty.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-arsenal-play-their-first-game-at-emirates-stadium>When did Arsenal play their first game at Emirates Stadium?</h2>
<p>The imposing North and South Bridges were in place within six months and, in October 2004, the venue was officially named Emirates Stadium. The Topping-Out ceremony took place in August 2005 and, a year later, the stadium opened for business. Its first game was Dennis Bergkamp’s testimonial on July 22, 2006.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-emirates-stadium-in-highbury-located>Where is the Emirates Stadium in Highbury located?</h2>
<p>/ ﻿ 51.55667°N 0.10611°W ﻿ / 51.55667; -0.10611 The Emirates Stadium (known as Ashburton Grove prior to sponsorship, and as Arsenal Stadium for UEFA competitions) is a football stadium in Highbury, England, and the home of Arsenal.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-architectural-elements-of-emirates-stadium>What are the architectural elements of Emirates Stadium?</h2>
<p>Architectural elements added to the stadium like facades out front and decorations adorning the structure serve that purpose. While the stadium is impressive from an architectural art perspective, it does not meet structural art standards. Reinforced concrete was used for the flooring and framing of the first three levels of the stadium [1].</p>
