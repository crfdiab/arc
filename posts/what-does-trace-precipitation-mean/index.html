<h2 id=what-does-trace-precipitation-mean>What does trace precipitation mean?</h2>
<p>: a minute amount of precipitation (as of rain) specifically : an amount measuring less than 0.01 inch.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-track-rainfall>How do you track rainfall?</h2>
<p>The standard instrument for the measurement of rainfall is the 203mm (8 inch) rain gauge. This is essentially a circular funnel with a diameter of 203mm which collects the rain into a graduated and calibrated cylinder. The measuring cylinder can record up to 25mm of precipitation.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-track-rainfall>Why do we track rainfall?</h2>
<p>So, precipitation measurement is important for weather forecasting. What else, precipitation is a resource of fresh water. We do not only use water for our daily needs, we use water to produce energy. Most of the fresh water reaches the ground as rain, and rain gauges are the direct resource to measure the rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-highest-rainfall-country-in-the-world>Which is highest rainfall country in the world?</h2>
<p>Colombia<br>
Average precipitation in depth (mm per year) – Country Ranking</p>
<table><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Country</th><th>Value</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Colombia</td><td>3,240.00</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>São Tomé and Principe</td><td>3,200.00</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Papua New Guinea</td><td>3,142.00</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Solomon Islands</td><td>3,028.00</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-trace>How much is a trace?</h2>
<p>“Trace” amounts are defined as less than half that amount (0.005 inch). The depth of frozen precipitation like snow is measured in tenths (0.1) of an inch and trace amounts are defined as less than half that amount (0.05 inch).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-t-in-precipitation-data>What is T in precipitation data?</h2>
<p>When Precipitation Falls, but Not Enough to Measure In meteorology, the word “trace” is used to describe a very small amount of precipitation that results in no measurable accumulation. Trace amounts of precipitation are abbreviated by the capital letter “T”, often placed in parenthesis (T).</p>
<h2 id=how-is-rain-measured-in-cm>How is rain measured in cm?</h2>
<p>It is expressed as cm per hour or mm per hour. Rainfall is measured by means of rain gauges. The shank of the funnel is put in a receiving bottle capable of taking 10 cm of rainfall. The rainfall collected in the bottle is measured with the help of a graduated measuring cylinder furnished with each rain gauge.</p>
<h2 id=why-rainfall-is-measured-in-cm>Why rainfall is measured in cm?</h2>
<p>So when you see a rainfall reading in millimetres or centimetres, it is simply the height to which the collected water rose in the funnel of the rain gauge.</p>
<h2 id=who-invented-rain-gauge>Who invented rain gauge?</h2>
<p>The first standardized rain gauge was invented in 1441 in Korea. In 1662 the first tipping bucket rain gauge was invented in Britain by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke. The first systematic rainfall measurements were done between 1677 and 1694 by Richard Townley in Britain.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-definition-of-a-trace-of-precipitation>What is the definition of a trace of precipitation?</h2>
<p>Definition of trace of precipitation. : a minute amount of precipitation (as of rain) specifically : an amount measuring less than 0.01 inch.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-a-trace-of-rain-in-inches>How big is a trace of rain in inches?</h2>
<p>If you must convert a trace to a numerical amount, it would equal 0.00. When it comes to liquid precipitation (rainfall), meteorologists don’t measure anything under 0.01 inch (one hundredth of an inch). Since a trace is anything less than can be measured, anything less than 0.01 inch of rain is reported as a trace of rain.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-a-trace-of-snow>What do you call a trace of snow?</h2>
<p>This is why frozen precipitation is measured to the nearest 0.1 inch (one tenth of an inch). A trace of snowfall or ice, then, is anything less than this. A trace of snow is commonly called a dusting. Snow flurries are the most common cause of trace precipitation in winter.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-precipitation-is-measured-in-inches>What does it mean when precipitation is measured in inches?</h2>
<p>That means that it takes more snow or ice to equal the same amount of liquid water that falls as rain. This is why frozen precipitation is measured to the nearest 0.1 inch (one tenth of an inch).</p>
