<p>Napoleon<br>
23.2. 3: Abdication in Spain. In an attempt to control the Iberian Peninsula, in 1808 Napoleon forced the abdications of Charles IV and Ferdinand VII of Spain and granted the Spanish crown to his brother Joseph, provoking a violent conflict that overlapped with the Peninsular War.</p>

The Treaty of Valençay was signed between the French Empire and the Spanish Crown on 11 December 1813. The agreement provided for the restoration of Ferdinand VII as King of Spain, who had been imprisoned in France, in the Château de Valençay, since his abdication in 1808.</p>

<p>Following this, Ferdinand was announced the king of Spain on 24 August 1808 for the second time. The British also recognized him as the king this time. On 11 December 1813, the Treaty of Valençay was signed wherein Napoleon acknowledged Ferdinand as the king of Spain after five years of his reign.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-spain-in-1814>Who was the King of Spain in 1814?</h2>
<p>Alternative Titles: Ferdinand the Desired, Fernando el Deseado. Ferdinand VII, byname Ferdinand the Desired, Spanish Fernando el Deseado, (born October 14, 1784, El Escorial, Spain—died September 29, 1833, Madrid), king of Spain in 1808 and from 1814 to 1833.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-ferdinand-vii-return-to-the-throne>When did Ferdinand VII return to the throne?</h2>
<p>Ferdinand VII. Napoleon then placed his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, on the throne. An exile in France since 1808, Ferdinand VII returned to Spain in 1814 after the collapse of French rule in that country. Surrounding himself with a camarilla, he proceeded to undo the accomplishments of the Spanish Revolution of 1808–14.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-spain-during-the-french-occupation>Who was the King of Spain during the French occupation?</h2>
<p>Ferdinand’s government now depended on a militia, the Royalist Volunteers, and the French forces of occupation. Ferdinand had no children from his three marriages, and his absolutist supporters looked to his even more absolutist younger brother, Don Carlos (Carlos María Isidro de Borbón), to succeed him.</p>
