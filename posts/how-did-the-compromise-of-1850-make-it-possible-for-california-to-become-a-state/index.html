<p>California was admitted to the Union as the 16th free state. In exchange, the south was guaranteed that no federal restrictions on slavery would be placed on Utah or New Mexico. The Compromise of 1850 overturned the Missouri Compromise and left the overall issue of slavery unsettled.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-compromise-of-1850-apush>What was the Compromise of 1850 Apush?</h2>
<p>What is the Compromise of 1850? The Compromise of 1850 is a group of five laws passed in September of 1850. These laws made concessions to both free and slave states in an attempt to placate both sides of the slavery debate and preserve the union.</p>
<h2 id=was-the-compromise-of-1850-good-or-bad>Was the Compromise of 1850 Good or bad?</h2>
<p>The Compromise of 1850 did a few things successfully. California became a state, Texas finally defined its borders, the slave trade was abolished in D.C. But other parts of the bill just stirred the pot even harder. The new Fugitive Slave Act just strengthened abolitionist sentiment in the North.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-compromise-of-1850>What caused the Compromise of 1850?</h2>
<p>The crisis arose from the request of the territory of California (December 3, 1849) to be admitted to the Union with a constitution prohibiting slavery. The problem was complicated by the unresolved question of slavery’s extension into other areas ceded by Mexico the preceding year (see Mexican-American War).</p>
<h2 id=why-was-california-admitted-as-a-free-state>Why was California admitted as a free state?</h2>
<p>With the Gold Rush came a huge increase in population and a pressing need for civil government. In 1849, Californians sought statehood and, after heated debate in the U.S. Congress arising out of the slavery issue, California entered the Union as a free, nonslavery state by the Compromise of 1850.</p>
<h2 id=what-four-things-did-the-compromise-of-1850-do>What four things did the Compromise of 1850 do?</h2>
<p>The Compromise of 1850 contained the following provisions: (1) California was admitted to the Union as a free state; (2) the remainder of the Mexican cession was divided into the two territories of New Mexico and Utah and organized without mention of slavery; (3) the claim of Texas to a portion of New Mexico was …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-a-direct-effect-of-the-compromise-of-1850>What was a direct effect of the Compromise of 1850?</h2>
<p>Under the Compromise, California was admitted to the Union as a free state; the slave trade was outlawed in Washington, D.C., a strict new Fugitive Slave Act compelled citizens of free states to assist in capturing enslaved people; and the new territories of Utah and New Mexico would permit white residents to decide …</p>
<h2 id=what-state-became-free-in-the-compromise-of-1850>What state became free in the Compromise of 1850?</h2>
<p>The Compromise of 1850 admitted the State of California as the 16th free state of the Union. After the US-Mexico War the territory of California was governed by the military. Starting in January 1848 people from all over country and from foreign lands started coming to California attracted by the gold rush.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-california-become-a-state-of-the-union>When did California become a State of the Union?</h2>
<p>The Compromise of 1850 admitted California as a state of the Union. An Act for the admission of the State of California into the Union.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-california-get-into-the-union-without-slavery>How did California get into the Union without slavery?</h2>
<p>The compromise allowed the admission of California into the Union without Congress imposing any limitation on the introduction of slavery. However, the Constitution adopted by the California Constitutional Convention in October 1849 in preparation for admission into the Union specifically prohibited slavery in the new state.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-california-compromise>What was the result of the California compromise?</h2>
<p>The compromise also set the western boundary of Texas, provided for the enactment of a rigorous fugitive slave law, and banned the slave trade (though not slavery) in Washington, D.C. Two days after the California vote, on September 9, President Millard Fillmore, signed the measure into law, making California the 31st state.</p>
