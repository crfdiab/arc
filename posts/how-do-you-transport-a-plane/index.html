<h2 id=how-do-you-transport-a-plane>How do you transport a plane?</h2>
<p>Even small airplanes are usually delivered by flying them. There are companies that specialize in doing this. They outfit the aircraft with extra fuel tanks and obtain a special permit to “ferry” the airplane to its new home.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-air-transportation-system>How is air transportation system?</h2>
<p>The air transport system consists of three main components: airports, ATC (air traffic control) system, and airlines. The airports accommodate the airline aircraft at the beginning and end of their flights between them, serving the passengers and freight cargo demand.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-aircraft-transportation>What is aircraft transportation?</h2>
<p>Air transportation is the movement of passengers and freight by any conveyance that can sustain controlled flight.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-air-transport-facilitate-transportation>How does air transport facilitate transportation?</h2>
<p>Air transport facilitates integration into the global economy and provides vital connectivity on a national, regional, and international scale. It helps generate trade, promote tourism, and create employment opportunities. Economic sector work, research, and knowledge dissemination on air transport related issues.</p>
<h2 id=can-planes-carry-other-planes>Can planes carry other planes?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. If you want to count it as an airplane, the Space Shuttle can be carried by specially modified 747’s. NASA and the USAF have used specially modified B-29’s and B-52’s to carry experimental planes to altitude, where they are launched for their test flights.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-bring-a-knife-on-a-plane>Can you bring a knife on a plane?</h2>
<p>Re: Can you bring a pocket knife in your checked baggage? Hi Ryan, generally you can in checked in luggage, so long as there is no risk of the knife injuring the baggage handlers (so make sure it’s folded or sheathed).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-of-air-transport>What are the advantages of air transport?</h2>
<p>Advantages of Air Transport:</p>
<ul>
<li>The following are the main advantages:</li>
<li>High Speed:</li>
<li>Minimum Cost:</li>
<li>Strategic Importance:</li>
<li>Easy transport of costly and light goods:</li>
<li>Free from physical barriers:</li>
<li>Useful for Agriculture:</li>
<li>Useful in natural calamities:</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-means-of-air-transport>What are the main means of air transport?</h2>
<p>Air travel is a form of travel in vehicles such as airplanes, jet aircraft, helicopters, hot air balloons, blimps, gliders, hang gliders, parachutes, or anything else that can sustain flight. Use of air travel has greatly increased in recent decades – worldwide it doubled between the mid-1980s and the year 2000.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-largest-military-transport-plane>What is the largest military transport plane?</h2>
<p>Antonov An-124 Ruslan<br>
The Antonov An-124 Ruslan (NATO designation Condor) is named after a legendary giant. It is broadly similar to the slightly smaller Lockheed C-5 Galaxy. Currently the An-124 is the world’s largest production military aircraft.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-5-modes-of-transportation>What are the 5 modes of transportation?</h2>
<p>These most common five modes of transport are: railways, roadways, airways, waterways and pipelines. Following is the brief account of each mode with reference to Indian conditions with relative merits and demerits.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-examples-of-air-transport>What are the examples of air transport?</h2>
<p>Here’s the types that I know of, whether they are used for pleasure, business, or military purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hot air balloons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blimps and dirigibles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helicopters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autogyros.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Airplanes (planes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ornithopters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gliders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id=jet-packs-why-air-transport-is-considered-the-most-expensive-mode-of-transport>Jet packs. Why air transport is considered the most expensive mode of transport?</h2>
<p>Air transport is considered costlier as compare to other mode of transport. Because of this reason the fare of air transport are high that common people can’t afford it. Small Carrying Capacity. The aircrafts have small carrying capacity and therefore these are not suitable for carrying bulky and cheaper goods.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-air-transport-used-in-the-world>How is air transport used in the world?</h2>
<p>Air transport can be used to carry goods and people to the areas which are not accessible by other means of transport. 6. Emergency Services: It can operate even when all other means of transport cannot be operated due to the floods or other natural calamities.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-airlines-an-example-of-a-transportation-system>How are Airlines an example of a transportation system?</h2>
<p>Airlines are known to fail as economic enterprises, public systems encounter deficits, excessive crashes occur on highways, and spacecraft are sometimes lost. Understanding transportation systems in terms of their technological and economic complexity, and their important impacts on society, is a large and fascinating field of study.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-small-aircraft-transportation-systems-located>Where are the small aircraft transportation systems located?</h2>
<p>The basic concept behind the Small Aircraft Transportation System is simple. Instead of relying on a few big airports, SATS will utilize the more than 5,000 small, local airports situated throughout the United States.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-air-transportation-so-important-in-india>Why is air transportation so important in India?</h2>
<p>Air transport is the most modern means of transport which is unmatched by its speed, time- saving and long-distance operation. It is very impor­tant for a large country like India. Through it one can easily reach to remote and inaccessible areas like mountains, forests, deserts etc.</p>
