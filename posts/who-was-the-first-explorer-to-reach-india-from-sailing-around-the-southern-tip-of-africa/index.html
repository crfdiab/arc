<p>Vasco da Gama<br>
Vasco da Gama was best known for being the first to sail from Europe to India by rounding Africa’s Cape of Good Hope. Over the course of two voyages, beginning in 1497 and 1502, da Gama landed and traded in locales along the coast of southern Africa before reaching India on May 20, 1498.</p>
<h2 id=which-explorer-searched-for-a-new-route-to-india-around-the-southern-tip-of-africa>Which explorer searched for a new route to India around the southern tip of Africa?</h2>
<p>Portugal sent out ​Vasco da Gama​ who found a trade route around the southern tip of Africa and to India. They also explored much of the Far East and were the first Europeans to establish a trading colony in China at Macau.</p>

<p>In 1488, Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias (c. 1450-1500) became the first European mariner to round the southern tip of Africa, opening the way for a sea route from Europe to Asia.</p>
<h2 id=what-made-it-difficult-to-sail-around-the-tip-of-africa>What made it difficult to sail around the tip of Africa?</h2>
<p>Cape Horn marks the point at which the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans meet – which is what makes the passage so treacherous. Extreme low-pressure systems whirl across the sea, creating the dreaded williwaw winds.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-explorer-to-sail-around-africa>Who was the first explorer to sail around Africa?</h2>
<p>DIAS, BARTOLOMEU. Bartolomeu Dias (1457-1500) was a great Portuguese navigator and explorer who explored Africa’s coast. In 1488, Dias led the first European expedition to sail around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, leaving Tagus, Portugal in 1487.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-southern-tip-of-africa-called>What was the southern tip of Africa called?</h2>
<p>Mariners have long considered the waters off Africa’s southern tip to be treacherous. After decades of failed attempts to navigate around the continent, Portuguese explorers took to calling one of its southerly promontories the Cape of Storms. (It was later renamed the Cape of Good Hope.)</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-european-to-sail-around-the-cape-of-good-hope>Who was the first European to sail around the Cape of Good Hope?</h2>
<p>In 1488, Dias led the first European expedition to sail around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, leaving Tagus, Portugal in 1487. This breakthrough of circumnavigating the Cape of Good Hope opened up lucrative trading routes from Europe to Asia.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-bartolomeu-dias-discover-the-southern-tip-of-africa>When did Bartolomeu Dias discover the southern tip of Africa?</h2>
<p>He was the first European navigator to round the southern tip of Africa in 1488 and demonstrate that the most effective southward course lay in the open ocean well to west of the African coast. His discoveries effectively established the sea route between Europe and Asia. Bartolomeu Dias was born in Portugal around 1450.</p>
