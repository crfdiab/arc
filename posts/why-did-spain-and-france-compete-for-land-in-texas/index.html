<h2 id=why-did-spain-and-france-compete-for-land-in-texas>Why did Spain and France compete for land in Texas?</h2>
<p>Spain wanted its conquistadors to find gold, to conquer the land, and to conquer the people.</p>
<h2 id=did-spain-have-any-rivals-in-texas>Did Spain have any rivals in Texas?</h2>
<p>Here we will follow (almost literally) the early competition between Spain and France for the land along the Gulf of Mexico we now call Texas and Louisiana. Unable to locate the river, La Salle built a small fort on the coast of Tejas at Matagorda Bay.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-french-call-the-territory-they-conquered>What did the French call the territory they conquered?</h2>
<p>The French Colonial Empire (French: Empire colonial français) comprised the overseas colonies, protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-french-come-to-texas-in-1850>Why did the French come to Texas in 1850?</h2>
<p>The French who came to Texas in search of better social, political, and economic conditions contributed to the state in extending the frontier and in encouraging cultural development. The census of 1850 showed 647 French-born men in Texas; that of 1860 listed 1,883.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-spain-want-to-settle-in-texas>Why did Spain want to settle in Texas?</h2>
<p>In 1722 the Marques de Aguayo urged the establishment of an officially recognized civil settlement to strengthen Spain’s claims to Texas. Within a year the King of Spain made a formal proposal to Spaniards living in the Canary Islands to settle in New Spain.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-french-people-live-in-the-state-of-texas>How many French people live in the state of Texas?</h2>
<p>The census of 1850 showed 647 French-born men in Texas; that of 1860 listed 1,883. In 1930 the census showed 10,185 persons of French nationality in the state. In 1990 there were 571,175 people of French descent in Texas. Eugéne Maissin, The French in Mexico and Texas, 1838–1839 (Salado, Texas: Anson Jones Press, 1961).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-treaty-between-france-and-texas>What was the treaty between France and Texas?</h2>
<p>On February 14, 1840, a commercial treaty was made between France and the Republic of Texas, and with the making of the treaty French interest in Texas increased. A French chargé or minister was sent to the republic, and plans were made for sending French colonists to Texas.</p>
