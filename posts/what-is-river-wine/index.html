<h2 id=what-is-river-wine>What is river wine?</h2>
<p>Established in 2010, The River Wine is based on the founders’ love of wine and desire to provide a small, focused portfolio of unique products. The River is an importer, distributor and producer, committed to offering superior wines and spirits from around the world, with a focus on Israel, Italy and California. MORE ></p>
<h2 id=why-are-vineyards-near-rivers>Why are vineyards near rivers?</h2>
<p>In short, rivers counteract the most brutal elements of a region’s climate and give winemakers better crops to work with every season. In the Duero valley on the Iberian peninsula, rivers fulfill the opposite function by cooling hot, arid vineyards responsible for exalted Tempranillos and rich red blends.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-wine-is-margaret-river-known-for>What type of wine is Margaret River known for?</h2>
<p>In under fifty years, Margaret River has built an international reputation as a home of fine wine in Australia. It is a region that is more than capable of producing wines to match the world’s best, offering powerful, yet elegant, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Semillon/Sauvignon Blanc blends.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-margaret-river-good-for-wine>Why is Margaret River good for wine?</h2>
<p>Margaret River soils are predominantly deep, well-drained, red gravelly loams. Over time, the ridge has created a complex network of gneiss, schist and granite-based soils, the oldest in the world. These soils are low in nutrients, resulting in low vigour in the vineyard – ideal for producing high-quality grapes.</p>
<h2 id=are-margaret-river-wines-good>Are Margaret River wines good?</h2>
<p>Margaret River is blessed like few other regions with vintages of consistently high quality, while by no means being homogenous in style. While the heat of some vintages can pose a challenge, many of these years have also been the most celebrated for producing cabernet sauvignon.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-wineries-are-in-margaret-river>How many wineries are in Margaret River?</h2>
<p>Producing more than 25 percent of Australia’s premium wine, Margaret River is one of the nation’s largest wine regions, with more than 200 vineyards.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-vineyards-always-on-hills>Why are vineyards always on hills?</h2>
<p>Why are most vineyards located on hills, rather than in valleys? The topography of a hill provides ideal growing conditions for wine grapes. The altitude of a hill can protect grapes against sudden frosts which occur in a valley, and which could kill an entire crop.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-layout-a-vineyard>How do you layout a vineyard?</h2>
<p>A vineyard to be laid out in blocks is started by establishing a straight baseline. By choosing a base line, such as a fence or road the grower can establish a first row. The Right Triangle Rule (3-4-5 rule) is used to establish a perpendicular baseline at each end of the row (See Figure 5.4).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-margaret-river-good-for-chardonnay>Why is Margaret River good for chardonnay?</h2>
<p>Good chardonnay is made in many places across Australia. In line with Australian chardonnays generally, Margaret River wines have evolved beautifully in style from simpler equations of ripe fruit plus oak, into wines of complexity, subtlety and refinement. The 2018 crop showcases this well.</p>
<h2 id=is-wine-tasting-free-in-margaret-river>Is wine tasting free in Margaret River?</h2>
<p>Even if you can’t afford lunch, many vineyards in the Margaret River region have free cellar door tastings daily which allow you to sample their finest wines.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-a-wine-is-dry>What does it mean when a wine is dry?</h2>
<p>Our Guide To Dry Wines. A dry wine is simply a wine that has no residual sugar, meaning it isn’t sweet. When grape juice converts to wine, alcohol is produced in the fermentation process because yeast eats the sugar present in the juice. In many wines, the winemaker stops the fermentation process before the yeast has time…</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-winemaker-make-a-dry-wine>How does a winemaker make a dry wine?</h2>
<p>To make a dry wine, the winemaker will instead let the fermentation process finish completely, allowing the yeast to consume all the sugar present. No more sugar, so no sugary sweetness; the wine is therefore dry. Tip! Do not confuse the absence of sweetness or dryness with the absence of fruit.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-wine-producers-in-margaret-river>Who are the wine producers in Margaret River?</h2>
<p>A selective list of the 215 (2012) grape growers and wine producers in the Margaret River Wine Region includes: Aravina Estate. Ashbrook Estate. Brookland Valley Estate. Cape Mentelle. Clairault Streicker Estate. Brookland Valley. Cullen Wines.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-wine-dry-out-your-mouth>What makes a wine dry out your mouth?</h2>
<p>A wine can only dry out your mouth if it has strong tannins, not if it is “dry.”. Another misconception is that a “dry” wine is a wine that is higher in alcohol. Therefore, if we like higher alcohol wines, we like “dry” wines.</p>
