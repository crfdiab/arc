<h2 id=where-did-columbus-believe-he-had-landed-on-his-first-voyage-across-the-atlantic-in-1492>Where did Columbus believe he had landed on his first voyage across the Atlantic in 1492?</h2>
<p>Cuba<br>
He thought that he had found it in Cuba, where he landed on October 28, but he convinced himself by November 1 that Cuba was the Cathay mainland itself, though he had yet to see evidence of great cities.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-1492-so-important>Why is 1492 so important?</h2>
<p>The year 1492 has always been a significant year in his understanding of world history, forever associated with Columbus’s discovery of a sea route to America, which united civilisations by transforming the Atlantic from an insuperable barrier into a highway of trade and ideas.</p>
<h2 id=what-happen-in-the-year-1492>What happen in the year 1492?</h2>
<p>On August 3, 1492, Columbus set sail from Palos, Spain, with three small ships, the Santa Maria, the Pinta and the Nina. Later that month, Columbus sighted Cuba, which he thought was mainland China, and in December the expedition landed on Hispaniola, which Columbus thought might be Japan.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-christopher-columbus-land-in-the-new-world>Where did Christopher Columbus land in the New World?</h2>
<p>On October 12, the expedition reached land, probably Watling Island in the Bahamas. Later that month, Columbus sighted Cuba, which he thought was mainland China, and in December the expedition landed on Hispaniola, which Columbus thought might be Japan. He established a small colony there with 39 of his men.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-christopher-columbus-discover-on-his-voyage>What did Christopher Columbus Discover on his voyage?</h2>
<p>He was determined to find a direct water route west from Europe to Asia, but he never did. Instead, he stumbled upon the Americas. Though he did not really “discover” the New World—millions of people already lived there—his journeys marked the beginning of centuries of exploration and colonization of North and South America.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-christopher-columbus-rebuffed-by-the-spanish>Why was Christopher Columbus rebuffed by the Spanish?</h2>
<p>He was rebuffed and went to Spain, where he was also rejected at least twice by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. However, after the Spanish conquest of the Moorish kingdom of Granada in January 1492, the Spanish monarchs, flush with victory, agreed to support his voyage.</p>

<p>READ MORE: Christopher Columbus Never Set Out to Prove the Earth was Round With only the Atlantic Ocean, he thought, lying between Europe and the riches of the East Indies, Columbus met with King John II of Portugal and tried to persuade him to back his “Enterprise of the Indies,” as he called his plan.</p>
