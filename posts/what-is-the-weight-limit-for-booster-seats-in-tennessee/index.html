<p>Finding the right seat for your child</p>
<table><tr><th>Type of seat</th><th>Required for children who are</th></tr><tr><td>Forward-facing car seat</td><td>Age 1 to 3 years who weigh more than 20 pounds</td></tr><tr><td>Belt-positioning booster seat</td><td>Age 4 to 8 years who are shorter than 4 feet 9 inches.</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=when-should-my-child-stop-using-a-booster>When should my child stop using a booster?</h2>
<p>All children whose weight or height exceeds the forward-facing limit for their car safety seat should use a belt-positioning booster seat until the vehicle seat belt fits properly, typically when they have reached 4 feet 9 inches in height and are 8 to 12 years of age.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-7-year-old-need-car-seat>Does a 7 year old need car seat?</h2>
<p>Children 0 through 3 years or under 40 pounds must use a car seat. Children 4 through 7 years and more than 40 pounds and over 57 inches should use a booster seat.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-child-restraint-law-in-tennessee>What is the child restraint law in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>Tennessee Car Seat Safety Law The law is still applicable in 2021. Thus, the law states that all children younger than sixteen are the driver’s responsibility, and they must use child restraint systems by federal motor vehicle safety standards and suggestions.</p>
<h2 id=are-high-back-boosters-safer>Are high back boosters safer?</h2>
<p>Consumer Reports says high-backed boosters are safer than backless ones because they do a better job of properly positioning the seat belt across the child’s chest, hips and thighs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says booster seats can reduce a child’s risk of serious injury by 45 percent.</p>
<h2 id=when-can-a-child-sit-in-the-front-seat-in-tn>When can a child sit in the front seat in TN?</h2>
<p>When can my child sit in the front seat? Tennessee state law mandates that your child should sit in the rear seat (when available) until they turn 9 years old. Children age 12 and under should ride in the back seat of the vehicle whenever possible as the back seat is the safest position for children.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-do-you-have-to-be-to-sit-in-the-front-seat-in-tennessee>How tall do you have to be to sit in the front seat in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>four feet and nine inches tall<br>
Tennessee State Law Between the years of one and three or above 20 pounds they can be in either a front or rear-facing safety seat. Between the ages of four and eight and less than four feet and nine inches tall children are legally allowed to stop using a child safety seat and start using a booster seat.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-ride-in-a-booster-seat-in-tennessee>How old do you have to be to ride in a booster seat in Tennessee?</h2>
<p>The proper child restraint system varies depending on the child’s age, weight, and height. Below you’ll find more details on these requirements, as well as the penalties of a child seat or seatbelt violation. In Tennessee, the driver or parent is responsible for ensuring all occupants under 16 years old are properly secured.</p>

<p>In the event that a child is of an age, weight, and height to fall into two child seat categories, the safest option must be decided upon by the parents. In Alaska, however, you have to use a booster seat for children aged between four and eight who weigh up to 65 pounds and are up to 4’9” in height.</p>
