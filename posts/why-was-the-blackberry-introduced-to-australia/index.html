<h2 id=why-was-the-blackberry-introduced-to-australia>Why was the Blackberry introduced to Australia?</h2>
<p>Blackberries were introduced to Australia in the 1850’s. They were brought to Australia to help stop erosion near Melbourne and other cities. Blackberries were also used to make delicious food products such as blackberry jam, tarts, pies and many more.</p>
<h2 id=what-plants-have-been-introduced-to-australia>What plants have been introduced to Australia?</h2>
<p>Plants</p>
<ul>
<li>Acacia farnesiana (sweet acacia)</li>
<li>Ailanthus altissima (tree of heaven)</li>
<li>Alternanthera philoxeroides (alligator weed)</li>
<li>Andropogon virginicus (broomsedge)</li>
<li>Annona glabra (alligator apple)</li>
<li>Anredera cordifolia (Madeira vine)</li>
<li>Ardisia elliptica (shoebutton Ardisia)</li>
<li>Arundo donax (giant cane)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-did-thistle-start>How did Thistle start?</h2>
<p>Thistle launched last summer in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. I remember walking by one day and seeing a pop-up out in front of West of Pecos. Thistle founder Ashwin Cheriyan thinks so. Cheriyan was a corporate lawyer in a previous life and chalked up his unhealthy eating habits to the motive to create Thistle.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-blackberry-a-problem>Why is blackberry a problem?</h2>
<p>Why is blackberry a problem? Blackberry impacts the environment and agriculture. Blackberry forms dense thickets that exclude native species, leading to its complete dominance of the vegetation understorey and eventually the canopy. The thickets also limit people’s access, alter fire regimes and dominate the landscape.</p>
<h2 id=is-blackberry-native-to-australia>Is blackberry native to Australia?</h2>
<p>Blackberries may taste good, but they make Australian native plants choke and farmland disappear under the thorny sprawl. In Australia, feral blackberries cover nearly nine million hectares, a land mass larger than the whole of Tasmania.</p>
<h2 id=is-thistle-bad-for-cows>Is thistle bad for cows?</h2>
<p>Although sometimes grown as an ornamental or medicinal plant, in our region this plant has proven to be invasive and toxic to cattle and sheep.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-fastest-growing-woody-plant-in-the-world>What is the fastest growing woody plant in the world?</h2>
<p>Bamboo is the fastest growing woody plant on this planet. It grows one third faster than the fastest growing tree. The giant timber bamboos can grow to over 40 m.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-thistle-a-symbol-of>What is the thistle a symbol of?</h2>
<p>Thistle History In Celtic symbolism the thistle represents nobility and graciousness. It became the emblem of Scotland in the 1200s, as well as the Chivalric Order of the Thistle in 1540. The Thistle has a very thorny reputation.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-scotlands-national-flower-the-thistle>Why is Scotland’s national flower the thistle?</h2>
<p>But one legend has it a sleeping party of Scots warriors were saved from ambush by an invading Norse army when one of the enemies trod on the spiky plant. His anguished cry roused the slumbering warriors who duly vanquished the invader and adopted the thistle as their national symbol.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-thistle-first-appear-in-australia>When did the Thistle first appear in Australia?</h2>
<p>Old sources often use very formal language, so it’s useful to start your research with contemporary secondary sources, which are easier to read and give the most recent interpretation of the topic. The infamous thistle first appeared on squatting runs in the 1840s, and by the 1860s had become a widespread problem across Victoria.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-scotch-and-illyrian-thistles-come-from>Where did Scotch and Illyrian Thistles come from?</h2>
<p>Scotch and Illyrian thistles, Onopordum species (Blue thistle, cotton thistle, heraldic thistle and woolly thistle) Onopordum thistles were probably introduced from Europe in the early 1800s as ornamental plants. By 1850, Scotch thistle was recorded as a weed in Victoria and today both species are serious pasture weeds in South Eastern Australia.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-bring-camels-to-australia>Why did the British bring camels to Australia?</h2>
<p>Camels are not native to the Australian continent as they were introduced by British settlers in the 19th century in order to help explore the country’s vast desert regions.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-government-get-rid-of-thistles>How did the government get rid of thistles?</h2>
<p>It became such a pest that in the 1890s, the government introduced laws forcing landowners to control it. The government botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller, was even commissioned to write a book that identified the different kinds of thistles.</p>
