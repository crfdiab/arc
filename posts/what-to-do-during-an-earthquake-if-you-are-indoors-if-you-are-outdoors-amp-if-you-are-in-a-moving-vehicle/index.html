<h2 id=what-to-do-during-an-earthquake-if-you-are-indoors-if-you-are-outdoors-amp-if-you-are-in-a-moving-vehicle>What to do during an earthquake if you are indoors if you are outdoors & if you are in a moving vehicle?</h2>
<p>Do not rush to go out of the building, to avoid the stampede. If you are outside, move away from buildings and utipty wires. Once in the open, stay there till the vibrations stop. If you are in a moving vehicle, stop as quickly as possible and stay in the vehicle.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-safest-thing-to-do-if-an-earthquake-begins-when-in-building>What is the safest thing to do if an earthquake begins when in building?</h2>
<p>If you’re indoors, stay inside. If you’re outside, stay outside. If you’re indoors, stand against a wall near the center of the building, stand in a doorway, or crawl under heavy furniture (a desk or table). Stay away from windows and outside doors.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-safest-place-to-hide-during-an-earthquake>Where is the safest place to hide during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>To stay safe, here are five of the safest places to take shelter when an earthquake hits your home. Sturdy Desks and Tables The safest place to perform the ‘duck, cover, and hold’ action is under a sturdy desk or table.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-if-you-are-in-a-public-place-during-an-earthquake>What to do if you are in a public place during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>If an earthquake happens while you are in a public place, theater, restaurant, or shopping mall, you need to find the nearest cover to protect yourself from falling objects. People will panic and run, but you shouldn’t. You have to protect yourself from the human stampede.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-have-to-hide-under-tables-during-an-earthquake>Why do we have to hide under tables during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>A desk, even a flimsy one, will keep the skull breakers off of your head, if just deflecting them as the desk gives way to one side. If beams give way or the building falls, a desk won’t matter one way of the other. The idea is to survive second by second. You deal as the event unfolds.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-protect-your-head-during-an-earthquake>How to protect your head during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Once you’ve found shelter, curl into a ball and use both your arms to protect your head and neck. If you use a wheelchair or similar mobility device, lock your wheels, bend over, protect your head and neck with your arms, and wait until the shaking stops.</p>
