<h2 id=what-are-the-roles-of-producers-consumers-and-decomposers-in-the-ecosystem>What are the roles of producers consumers and decomposers in the ecosystem?</h2>
<p>“How might different types of organisms–producers, consumers, decomposers–be important to a healthy ecosystem?” (Producers change energy into matter with chemical energy that other organisms can use and then consumers pass the matter and energy on to other organisms by eating and being eaten; decomposers recycle some …</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-roles-of-consumer>What are the 3 roles of consumer?</h2>
<p>Roles of a Consumer in a Society</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiator. Consumers determine the products and services they need, whether they are shopping for themselves, friends, family members or business clients.</li>
<li>Influencer.</li>
<li>Decider.</li>
<li>Buyer.</li>
<li>User.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-the-roles-of-producers-consumers-and-decomposers>What are the roles of producers, consumers, and decomposers?</h2>
<p>Important roles producers, consumers, and decomposers play in an ecosystem: Role of the producer: A producer captures energy and stores that energy in food as chemical energy. Producers such as plants have special organelles called as chloroplasts that absorb energy from the sun.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-consumers-in-an-ecosystem>What is the role of consumers in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>So, without producers ecosystem cannot function. A consumer is a heterotroph that cannot make its own food and eat producers or other organisms for energy. We are in the category of consumers that eat the food that producers like plants made. Consumers in an ecosystem balance the food chain by keeping plant populations in a limited number.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-consumers-and-producers-related-to-each-other>How are consumers and producers related to each other?</h2>
<p>Consumers obtain energy and nutrients from producers as they cannot make their own food. They are organisms that break down dead plant and animal into simple compounds. Example: scavengers are decomposers. These animals feed on dead bodies, such as vultures, hyenas etc.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-consumers-in-the-food-chain>Who are the consumers in the food chain?</h2>
<p>Explain the roles of producers, consumers, and decomposers in the food chain. Explain the roles of producers, consumers, and decomposers in the food chain.</p>
