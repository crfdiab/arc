<h2 id=what-are-three-ways-the-egyptians-used-the-nile>What are three ways the Egyptians used the Nile?</h2>
<p>They also farmed with animals. The Egyptians used the Nile for drinking water, irrigation, fishing, mud and reeds and they sailed around the Nileto transport goods.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-nile-help>How did the Nile help?</h2>
<p>The most important thing the Nile provided to the Ancient Egyptians was fertile land. Most of Egypt is desert, but along the Nile River the soil is rich and good for growing crops. They also sold a lot of their wheat throughout the Middle East helping the Egyptians to become rich.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-egyptians-use-the-nile-for-drinking-water>Did the Egyptians use the Nile for drinking water?</h2>
<p>Egyptians use the Nile for almost every purpose. Apart from drinking and irrigating agricultural fields, they use the Nile to bathe, clean clothes, wash pots and dishes, dispose of rubbish and toss away dead donkeys, dogs and cows.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-nile-river-originally-used-for>What was the Nile River originally used for?</h2>
<p>Quick Answer. The Nile River was originally used a food source for the Egyptian civilization. Researchers believe that the Egyptian people began living around the river in 6,000 B.C.E.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-do-on-the-banks-of-the-nile-river>What can you do on the banks of the Nile River?</h2>
<p>The mystique of the Nile River captures the world’s imagination. The agricultural community isn’t the only venture thriving on the banks of the Nile: The tourism industry is also in full force. Scores of guides and companies take tourists on desert treks, tours of the Great Pyramids, scuba diving expeditions and much more.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-ancient-egyptians-eat-in-the-nile-delta>What did the ancient Egyptians eat in the Nile Delta?</h2>
<p>For millennia, much of Egypt’s food has been cultivated in the Nile delta region. Ancient Egyptians developed irrigation methods to increase the amount of land they could use for crops and support a thriving population. Beans, cotton, wheat, and flax were important and abundant crops that could be easily stored and traded.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-hydroelectric-dams-on-the-nile-river>Are there any hydroelectric dams on the Nile River?</h2>
<p>Although plans are still underw­ay to continue developing electricity production in the area, several dams have already been built to control flooding and generate hydroelectric power. The Nile River has also been depicted repeatedly in television programs and major motion pictures, including “The Jewel of the Nile” (1985) and “The Simpsons .”</p>
