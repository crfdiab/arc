<h2 id=does-ca-dmv-check-warrants>Does CA DMV check warrants?</h2>
<p>DMV uses a credit/debit card processing company to process credit/debit card transactions for services, and does not retain, share, store or use personal information for any other purpose except pursuant to a search warrant, subpoena, court order, or investigation of a crime.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-extradition-between-states-work>How does extradition between States work?</h2>
<p>The Extradition Clause in the US Constitution requires states, upon demand of another state, to deliver a fugitive from justice who has committed a “treason, felony or other crime” to the state from which the fugitive has fled.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-california-have-to-extradite>How long does California have to extradite?</h2>
<p>The state that issued the extradition warrant will then have 21 days to pick up the person and bring them back to the home state. However the process to return a fugitive to the demanding state may take from 1-3 months.</p>
<h2 id=what-crimes-can-get-you-extradited>What crimes can get you extradited?</h2>
<p>Some crimes which may be subject to extradition include murder, kidnapping, drug trafficking, terrorism, rape, sexual assault, burglary, embezzlement, arson, or espionage. Some of the most common extradition cases involving the U.S. are between our neighboring countries of Mexico and Canada.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-extradition-laws-in-california>What are the extradition laws in California?</h2>
<p>California Extradition Law is pursuant Section 50.34 of the Penal Code. California has signed onto the “Uniform Criminal Extradition Act.” Both of these laws require a person arrested in another state to be returned to California to face their criminal charges.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-person-with-a-felony-fly-without-a-warrant>Can a person with a felony fly without a warrant?</h2>
<p>So, can you fly? With the exception of international drug traffickers and those who commit certain sex crimes, those who are released from prison after a felony charge or have a warrant issued in their name can fly domestically and request a new passport, but their application will no doubt be reviewed alongside any arrest record.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-travel-on-an-airline-with-an-outstanding-warrant>Can you travel on an airline with an outstanding warrant?</h2>
<p>Whether or not you can travel on an airline with an outstanding warrant depends in large part on where you are travelling. Generally speaking, you should have no issue travelling within Canada.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-travel-if-there-is-a-warrant-for-your-arrest-in-canada>Can you travel if there is a warrant for your arrest in Canada?</h2>
<p>If there is an outstanding warrant for your arrest, you will most likely be able to travel within Canada without issue until you encounter the police. Police throughout Canada can find out if there is a warrant for your arrest by accessing the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC).</p>
<h2 id=can-a-bench-warrant-stop-you-from-flying>Can a bench warrant stop you from flying?</h2>
<p>Abraham Fernando Carpio-Gonzalez. A bench warrant does not stop you from flying, but if you run into any law enforcement agency in transit (most warrants show in national criminal databases) you most likely will get arrested and possibly held without bail until your court date.</p>
