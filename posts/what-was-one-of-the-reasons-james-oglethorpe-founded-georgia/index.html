<h2 id=what-was-one-of-the-reasons-james-oglethorpe-founded-georgia>What was one of the reasons James Oglethorpe founded Georgia?</h2>
<p>One of the three reasons for Georgia’s founding. James Oglethorpe and the trustees hoped to bring debtors and England’s “worthy poor” to the colony to begin new lives. Crops produced in the Georgia colony: wine, rice, indigo, silk, and tobacco. Town established by the Highland Scots.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-two-reasons-for-georgia-being-founded>What were the two reasons for Georgia being founded?</h2>
<p>Tip. The purpose of Georgia was twofold: To have a state between South Carolina and Spanish Florida that would act as a buffer and to create an opportunity for indebted British citizens to have a fresh start.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-main-reasons-for-establishing-the-colony-of-georgia>What were the main reasons for establishing the colony of Georgia?</h2>
<p>Although initially conceived of by James Oglethorpe as a refuge for London’s indebted prisoners, Georgia was ultimately established in 1732 to protect South Carolina and other southern colonies from Spanish invasion through Florida.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-second-king-of-the-colony-of-georgia>Who was the second king of the colony of Georgia?</h2>
<p>He was born in Germany and when he succeeded his father, George I, in 1727, he became the second of Britain’s Hanoverian German kings. George II signed the charter creating the colony of Georgia in 1732.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-georgia-in-1732>Who was the king of Georgia in 1732?</h2>
<p>Our state still bears his name, but King George II never set foot here. He was born in Germany and when he succeeded his father, George I, in 1727, he became the second of Britain’s Hanoverian German kings. George II signed the charter creating the colony of Georgia in 1732.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-half-crown-of-george-ii-come-from>Where did the half crown of George II come from?</h2>
<p>Half-Crown of George II, 1746. The inscription reads GEORGIUS II DEI GRATIA (George II by the Grace of God). The word LIMA under the king’s head signifies that the coin was struck from silver seized from the Spanish treasure fleet off Lima, Peru, during the War of the Austrian Succession.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-george-i-and-george-ii>What was the relationship between George I and George II?</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, opposition to George and Walpole grew as the pattern of George I’s reign repeated itself: George II and his son Frederick Louis, prince of Wales, quarrelled, and the prince became a leader of an antiadministration faction. By 1742 these dissidents were strong enough to force Walpole to resign.</p>
