<h2 id=what-is-a-chp-180>What is a CHP 180?</h2>
<p>A CHP-180 Stored Vehicle Report shall be made when a vehicle is stored for one of the. following reasons: • vehicle is apparently abandoned; • vehicle must be removed from its present location because it is in a “no parking”</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-notice-of-stored-vehicle-22852-vc>What is a Notice of Stored Vehicle 22852 VC?</h2>
<p>Notification of Stored Vehicle (22852 CVC) – this form includes a statement that informs the recipient of the opportunity for a post storage/impound hearing to specifically address/determine the validity of the storage/impound.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-stored-vehicle>What is a stored vehicle?</h2>
<p>Stored vehicle means a motor vehicle which has been parked in the same location without having been moved at least twenty-five feet (25′) for a period of twenty-four (24) hours or longer.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-stored-and-impounded-vehicle>What is the difference between stored and impounded vehicle?</h2>
<p>The difference between an impound and a storage is that a stored vehicle can be retrieved by the owner as soon as the paperwork is processed. An impounded vehicle is essentially in “car jail” until the police deem it fit for release.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-repo-and-impound>What is the difference between a repo and impound?</h2>
<p>is that “impound” is to shut up or place in an enclosure called a pound and “repo” is repossession.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-a-car-is-stored>What does it mean when a car is stored?</h2>
<p>Related Definitions Stored vehicle means a motor vehicle which has been parked in the same location without having been moved at least twenty-five feet (25′) for a period of twenty-four (24) hours or longer. Sample 1. Sample 2. Sample 3. Stored vehicle means a vehicle that is not consistently driven.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-cars-get-impounded>Why do cars get impounded?</h2>
<p>Police officers can impound your car for a variety of reasons. If you are arrested for a traffic violation, like a DUI, and no one else is present and able to drive your car, then they will typically impound it. Illegally parking or abandoning your vehicle also risks impoundment.</p>
<h2 id=does-my-car-need-to-be-insured-if-im-not-driving-it>Does my car need to be insured if I’m not driving it?</h2>
<p>If your car is off the road You don’t even have to be driving an uninsured vehicle to fall foul of the law. Legislation called Continuous Insurance Enforcement means you must keep your vehicle insured, even if you’re not driving it, unless you’ve made a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN).</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-stored-and-impounded>Whats the difference between stored and impounded?</h2>
<h2 id=does-impounded-car-affect-credit>Does impounded car affect credit?</h2>
<p>An impound itself doesn’t have a direct effect on your credit scores. It’s the consequences of not paying off the impound that’s a problem. Worse still, impound fees increase by the day. Generally, the better your credit scores are when a derogatory item hits your report, the more damage that entry will do.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-use-the-chp-180-for-lost-or-stolen-plates>Do you have to use the CHP 180 for lost or stolen plates?</h2>
<p>We have our own computerized forms for vehicle storages/impounds, 10851s, stolen plates, etc. There is no state requirement that says you have to use the CHP 180, so she is wrong. The “plates” box is for “lost or stolen” plates or recovered “lost or stolen” plates that need to be entered into or removed from CLETS.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-use-the-chp-180-box>Do you have to use the CHP 180 box?</h2>
<p>There is no state requirement that says you have to use the CHP 180, so she is wrong. The “plates” box is for “lost or stolen” plates or recovered “lost or stolen” plates that need to be entered into or removed from CLETS.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-chp-policy-a-solution-or-a-problem>Is the CHP policy a solution or a problem?</h2>
<p>CHP’s policy does not have any effect on any other agency, they just supply the forms. Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. – Ronald Reagan I don’t think It’ll happen in the US because we don’t trust our government. We are a country of skeptics, raised by skeptics, founded by skeptics. – Amaroq</p>
<h2 id=when-is-chp-is-the-most-efficient-method-of-heat-transport>When is CHP is the most efficient method of heat transport?</h2>
<p>CHP is most efficient when heat can be used on-site or very close to it. Overall efficiency is reduced when the heat must be transported over longer distances.</p>
