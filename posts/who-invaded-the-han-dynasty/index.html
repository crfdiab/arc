<h2 id=who-invaded-the-han-dynasty>Who invaded the Han Dynasty?</h2>
<p>Emperor Wu repelled the invading barbarians (the Xiongnu, or Huns, a nomadic-pastoralist warrior people from the Eurasian steppe), and roughly doubled the size of the empire, claiming lands that included Korea, Manchuria, and even part of Turkistan.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-when-the-han-dynasty-collapsed>What happened when the Han Dynasty collapsed?</h2>
<p>The Han dynasty formally ended in 220 when Cao Cao’s son and heir, Cao Pi, pressured Emperor Xian into abdicating in his favour. The period from the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 to the partial reunification of China under the Jin dynasty in 265 is known as the Three Kingdoms era in Chinese history.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-main-contenders-for-power-at-the-han-court>Who were the main contenders for power at the Han court?</h2>
<p>Two principal contenders emerged in this power struggle. The first one was Xiang Yu (233 BC – 202 BC), who was a former general of the state of Chu before the annexation by the Qin. The second one was Liu Bang (259 BC – 195 BC), who was originally a low ranking official under the Qin as a jailer.</p>
<h2 id=what-factors-led-to-the-decline-of-the-han-empire>What factors led to the decline of the Han empire?</h2>
<p>The 3 key factors that led to the decline of the Han empire are disease, political problems, and the inability to maintain order of the public. The fall of the Han empire was mainly caused by emperors who neglected their duties.</p>
<h2 id=who-killed-cao-cao>Who killed Cao Cao?</h2>
<p>Tao Qian<br>
Cao Cao’s father Cao Song was killed in autumn 193 by troops of Tao Qian, governor of Xu Province (who claimed to be innocent, and that Cao Song’s murderers had been mutineers). Enraged, Cao Cao massacred thousands of civilians in Xu during two punitive expeditions in 193 and 194, to avenge his father.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-concubines-did-cao-cao-have>How many concubines did Cao Cao have?</h2>
<p>According to historical records such as “Three Kingdoms”, there are 15 wives of Cao Cao.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-collapse-of-the-han-dynasty>What was the cause of the collapse of the Han dynasty?</h2>
<p>THE COLLAPSE OF THE HAN DYNASTY AND ROMAN EMPIRE. Although, the Han Dynasty and Roman Empire had many similar causes that led to their declines, such as the epidemic diseases, they had many major factors that differed from each other.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-last-emperor-of-the-han-dynasty>Who was the last emperor of the Han dynasty?</h2>
<p>In 220 CE Xiandi, the last Han emperor, ceded the throne to Cao Pi, who thereby became the heir of the empire and the first ruler of the Wei dynasty in one region. Han generals took over two other regions, creating the Shu-Han and Wu empires.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-the-western-han-empire>What was the history of the Western Han Empire?</h2>
<p>It was the first biographical book in Chinese history, which records the history from the age of the legendary Yellow Emperor to the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han. The Western Han empire was the first large and long-surviving empire in the region. It lasted from 206 BC until 9 AD. The Han empire was successful politically and economically.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-han-forces-repel-the-xiongnu-invasion>When did Han forces repel the Xiongnu invasion?</h2>
<p>In 121 BC, Han forces expelled the Xiongnu from a vast territory spanning the Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur. They repelled a joint Xiongnu- Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region: Jiuquan, Zhangyi, Dunhuang, and Wuwei.</p>
