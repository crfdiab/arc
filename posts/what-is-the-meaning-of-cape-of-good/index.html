<h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-cape-of-good>What is the meaning of Cape of Good?</h2>
<p>When following the western side of the African coastline from the equator, however, the Cape of Good Hope marks the point where a ship begins to travel more eastward than southward. Dias called the cape Cabo das Tormentas (“Cape of Storms”; Dutch: Stormkaap), which was the original name of the “Cape of Good Hope”.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-cape-mean-in-cape-of-good-hope>What does Cape mean in Cape of Good Hope?</h2>
<p>the Cape of Storms<br>
The Cape was originally named the Cape of Storms in the 1480s by the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias. It was later renamed to Good Hope to attract more people to the Cape Sea Route that passed the southern coast of Africa.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-know-what-a-proper-noun-is>How do you know what a proper noun is?</h2>
<p>A proper noun is the name given to something to make it more specific (e.g., Johnathan, Ollie, New York, Monday). Proper nouns are written with capital letters regardless of where they appear in a sentence. Proper nouns contrast with common nouns, which are the words for something (e.g., boy, dog, city, day).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-proper-noun-sentence>What is a proper noun sentence?</h2>
<p>A proper noun is a specific (i.e., not generic) name for a particular person, place, or thing. Proper nouns are always capitalized in English, no matter where they fall in a sentence. Every noun can be classified as either common or proper. A common noun is the generic name for one item in a class or group.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-cape-of-good-hope-called-that>Why is Cape of Good Hope called that?</h2>
<p>One historical account says that Dias named the promontory Cape of Storms and that John II of Portugal renamed it Cape of Good Hope (because its discovery was a good omen that India could be reached by sea from Europe); other sources attribute its present name to Dias himself.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-10-common-nouns>What are 10 common nouns?</h2>
<p>Examples of a Common Noun</p>
<ul>
<li>People: mother, father, baby, child, toddler, teenager, grandmother, student, teacher, minister, businessperson, salesclerk, woman, man.</li>
<li>Animals: lion, tiger, bear, dog, cat, alligator, cricket, bird, wolf.</li>
<li>Things: table, truck, book, pencil, iPad, computer, coat, boots,</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=what-language-did-the-boers-speak>What language did the Boers speak?</h2>
<p>Afrikaans<br>
By the end of the 18th century the cultural links between the Boers and their urban counterparts were diminishing, although both groups continued to speak Afrikaans, a language that had evolved from the admixture of Dutch, indigenous African, and other languages.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-cape-horn-so-bad>Why is Cape Horn so bad?</h2>
<p>The waters around Cape Horn are particularly hazardous, owing to strong winds, large waves, strong currents and icebergs. Several prominent ocean yacht races, notably the Volvo Ocean Race, the Velux 5 Oceans Race, and the Vendée Globe, sail around the world via the Horn.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-roughest-ocean>What is the roughest ocean?</h2>
<p>The South China Sea and East Indies, eastern Mediterranean, Black Sea, North Sea, and British Isles are the most dangerous seas in the world, with the greatest number of shipping accidents in the last 15 years, according to a report released by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-cape-of-good-hope-get-its-name>How did the Cape of Good Hope get its name?</h2>
<p>The Cape of Good Hope is located at the southern tip of the Cape Peninsula, which is also home to Cape Town, the legislative capital of South Africa. The Cape was originally named the Cape of Storms in the 1480s by the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias. It was later renamed to Good Hope to attract more people to the Cape Sea Route …</p>
<h2 id=is-the-cape-of-good-hope-the-southernmost-point-of-africa>Is the Cape of Good Hope the southernmost point of Africa?</h2>
<p>This misconception was based on the misbelief that the Cape was the dividing point between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Contemporary geographic knowledge instead states the southernmost point of Africa is Cape Agulhas about 150 kilometres (90 mi) to the east-southeast.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-definition-of-the-word-hope>Which is the best definition of the word hope?</h2>
<p>(uncountable) The belief or expectation that something wished for can or will happen. (countable) The actual thing wished for. (countable) A person or thing that is a source of hope. (Christianity) The virtuous desire for future good. A sloping plain between mountain ridges. (Scotland) A small bay; an inlet; a haven.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-waters-near-the-cape-of-good-hope-dangerous>Why are the waters near the Cape of Good Hope dangerous?</h2>
<p>The waters near the Cape, where the Atlantic and Indian Oceans meet, can be treacherous for ships. The warm Agulhas current from the east runs into the cold Benguela current from the northwest. Dangerous waves from these currents have caused many shipwrecks.</p>
