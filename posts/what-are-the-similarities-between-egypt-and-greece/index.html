<h2 id=what-are-the-similarities-between-egypt-and-greece>What are the similarities between Egypt and Greece?</h2>
<p>There were also similarities, such as both having a single person be the ruler, not giving equal power to everyone. For Greeks, this would be a king and for Egyptians, and Pharaoh. Both Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece believed in mythology – a similarity between the two. However, much of their mythology was different.</p>
<h2 id=are-greek-and-egyptian-gods-the-same>Are Greek and Egyptian gods the same?</h2>
<p>Although there are minor differences, Greek and Egyptian mythologies share many similarities. The idea of a supreme deity is common in both Greek and Egyptian traditions. Some Greek deities can also be identified with Egyptian ones, in particular the Greek Dionysus and the Egyptian Osiris.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-older-greek-or-egyptian-gods>Which is older Greek or Egyptian gods?</h2>
<p>Ancient Egyptian mythology must be older. When you examine the genealogy of Greek heroes, Greek legendary kings or semi-historic kings, you will find that they are only a few generations away from the Greek Gods, which means that the legend or myth is not very old. The Egyptian dynasties go much deeper back in time.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-strongest-greek-god>Who is the strongest Greek god?</h2>
<p>Zeus<br>
The most powerful of all, Zeus was god of the sky and the king of Mount Olympus. His temper affected the weather, and he threw thunderbolts when he was unhappy. He made the sun and moon come and go. He made the seasons change.</p>
<h2 id=what-came-first-greece-or-egypt>What came first Greece or Egypt?</h2>

<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-romans-and-egyptians>What is the difference between Romans and Egyptians?</h2>
<p>The Egyptians had less soldiers, a poor decision maker for a leader, and mild weaponry. The Romans had better weaponry, a great leader, and more soldiers. Therefore, the Ancient Roman Military is better because the Ancient Egyptian Military lacks in each aspects that Roman Military gains.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-greek-art-start>How did Greek art start?</h2>
<p>Greek art began in the Cycladic and Minoan civilization, and gave birth to Western classical art in the subsequent Geometric, Archaic and Classical periods (with further developments during the Hellenistic Period). Greek art is mainly five forms: architecture, sculpture, painting, pottery and jewelry making. …</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-egyptians-call-the-greeks>What did the Egyptians call the Greeks?</h2>
<p>The Egyptians referred to the Aegean in general as “the islands in the midst of the Great Green” (iww hryw-ib nw wAD-wr), and the Greek mainland was referred to as Tinayu (tinAyw). Tinayu did not appear in Egyptian writings until the reign of Thutmose III, but Keftiu appeared as early as the Middle Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-religion-like-in-ancient-egypt-and-greece>What was religion like in ancient Egypt and Greece?</h2>
<p>Many ancient civilizations believed in religions that worshiped more than one god or goddess, this is called polytheism. Both the Ancient Egyptians and the Ancient Greeks practiced polytheism. For both ancient civilizations religion was an important part of daily life. Ancient Egyptians and Ancient Greeks had similar creation stories</p>
<h2 id=how-are-ancient-egypt-and-ancient-greece-similar>How are ancient Egypt and ancient Greece similar?</h2>
<p>Ancient Greece and ancient Egypt changed much more than the time of their existence. Both of them started at the very beginning of their history as a society in the Hereafter. Their cultures rarely be gods and how they intertwine how they represent.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-egyptian-gods-and-goddesses-different-from-greek-gods>How are Egyptian gods and goddesses different from Greek gods?</h2>
<p>As compared to them the Egyptian gods such as Isis, Osiris, Seth, Horus are depicted as more aloof in nature, though influencing the course of human affairs but not through direct communication like in the case of the Greeks. Furthermore the Greek Gods and Goddesses are depicted as rather petty or humane one might say, taking offence a… Loading…</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-ancient-greeks-worship-their-gods>How did the ancient Greeks worship their gods?</h2>
<p>Greek gods were immortal. The people of Greece built temples (much like the pyramids that were in Egypt ), and gods were worshipped at these temples. Ceremonial rituals or any other special occasions took place here also. Most of the temples were constructed to honor a god, and they were sacred in their being.</p>
