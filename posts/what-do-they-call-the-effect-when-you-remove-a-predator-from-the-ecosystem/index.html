<h2 id=what-do-they-call-the-effect-when-you-remove-a-predator-from-the-ecosystem>What do they call the effect when you remove a predator from the ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Trophic Cascade<br>
Trophic Cascade When a top predator is removed from an ecosystem, a series knock-on effects are felt throughout all the levels in a food web, as each level is regulated by the one above it. This is known as a trophic cascade. The results of these trophic cascades can lead to an ecosystem being completely transformed.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-remove-an-apex-predator-from-a-food-chain>What happens if you remove an apex predator from a food chain?</h2>
<p>It also resulted in a trophic cascade. This can happen when a top predator is removed from an ecosystem. It affects the prey population and other organisms in the food web. When a top predator is removed, everything else will be affected in some way.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-there-were-no-coyotes>What would happen if there were no coyotes?</h2>
<p>When coyotes are absent or even just greatly reduced in a natural area, the relationships between species below them in the web are altered, putting many small species at risk.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-apex-predators-so-important-in-ecosystems>Why are apex predators so important in ecosystems?</h2>
<p>Apex predators are important because they operate as a negative feedback on the prey populations, providing ecological stability. Essentially, apex predators promote stability in ecosystems by keeping their prey populations balanced correctly.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-lions-were-removed-from-the-food-chain>What would happen if lions were removed from the food chain?</h2>
<p>So if lions are removed from the food chain than the number of deer and other prey will increase and when they will increase in number they will eat more vegetation and decrease the vegetation there so they will disturb the ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=which-population-of-animals-would-be-most-affected-if-all-carnivores-were-removed-from-an-ecosystem>Which population of animals would be most affected if all carnivores were removed from an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>If there were no carnivores, the herbivore populations would explode and they will rapidly consume large amounts of plants and fungi, growing until there is not enough food to sustain them. Eventually, the herbivores would starve, leaving only those plants that were distasteful or poisonous to them.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-top-predator-is-removed-from-an-animal>What happens when the top predator is removed from an animal?</h2>
<p>When prey becomes more scarce, the predator population declines until prey is again more abundant. Therefore, the two balance each other. When the predators are removed, prey populations explode. Without any predators to limit population growth, herbivorous prey species reproduce without check, and all of them are hungry.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-predators-keep-herbivore-populations-in-check>How do predators keep herbivore populations in check?</h2>
<p>Predators keep herbivore populations in check. The reverse is also true, of course — predator populations are limited by the availability of prey. When prey is abundant, predator populations increase because more young are able to survive. More predators kill more prey, which, along with food scarcity, decreases the population.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-an-animal-is-removed-from-the-food-chain>What happens if an animal is removed from the food chain?</h2>
<p>The food chain depends on a delicate balance of nature, when one organism is removed that delicate balance can be affected in a number of ways. The prey/predator relationships change. Removal of a predator causes overpopulation of prey. In areas where bobcats and wolves neared extinction, the deer population increased exponentially.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-top-predators-important-to-the-ecosystem>Why are top predators important to the ecosystem?</h2>
<p>In contrast, top predators often have varied diets, which means they can pursue a new food source if one is running low, preventing the first source from being eradicated completely. This is one of the ways that top predators are able to maintain biodiversity and the balance of an ecosystem.</p>
