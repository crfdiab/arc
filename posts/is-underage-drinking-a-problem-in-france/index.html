<p>Binge drinking is certainly still a concern in the UK. Us Brits have often had a troubled relationship with alcohol: drinking booze alongside each meal, groups of drunken youths in the streets.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-has-the-most-underaged-drinkers>What country has the most underaged drinkers?</h2>

<h2 id=why-is-there-less-binge-drinking-in-france>Why is there less binge drinking in France?</h2>
<p>Consequently, alcohol consumption is widespread, but moderate among adults, which explains why the French rank among the heaviest consumers of alcohol overall but are less likely to binge drink. The latter phenomenon is mainly a problem of young French, and much less represented among older generations.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-problem-with-alcohol-in-france>Is there a problem with alcohol in France?</h2>
<p>French alcohol researchers say these events reflect a growing problem of binge drinking among French teens. French government surveys show the number of French teens who drink heavily is on the rise, says Bertrand Nalpas, who heads the alcohol and addiction office at the French National Institute on Health and Medical Research.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-more-common-for-young-people-to-binge-drink>Is it more common for young people to binge drink?</h2>
