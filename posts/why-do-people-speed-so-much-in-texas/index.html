<h2 id=why-do-people-speed-so-much-in-texas>Why do people speed so much in Texas?</h2>
<p>The short answer is, Texas is a huge state and it is safe for travelers to get through the rural parts quickly! Large portions of the State are cattle ranches that go on for miles and miles and miles with little towns spread far and wide. So the speed limit is higher because it is rural and therefore has less traffic.</p>
<h2 id=is-speeding-against-the-law-in-texas>Is speeding against the law in Texas?</h2>
<p>Getting pulled over for one mph over the limit is a law violation. Texas is in the category of speeding laws called presumed laws. Ticketing is also up to the discretion of the trooper, but as long as you are driving safely, going a few mph over the limit is considered legal.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-failure-to-maintain-speed>What is failure to maintain speed?</h2>
<p>The language of the statute states that “no person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed greater than is reasonable or prudent having due regard for weather, visibility, the traffic on, and the surface and width of, the highway, and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property. 1.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-go-over-100-mph-in-texas>What happens if you go over 100 mph in Texas?</h2>
<p>Being caught at that speed also results in an automatic suspension of the driver’s license for up to 30 days, a stiff fine and 2 points on the driver’s record. Four points in 12 months will also result in suspension.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-go-5-over-the-speed-limit-in-texas>Can you go 5 over the speed limit in Texas?</h2>
<p>Note that driving less than 5 mph over legal speed limit in Texas state is typically considered acceptable and you should not get a traffic ticket for it. This is a reasonable margin of error and most law enforcement officers will not pull you over for exceeding speed limits by less than 5 miles per hour.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-failure-to-maintain-mean>What does failure to maintain mean?</h2>
<p>“Failure to maintain lane” means that a driver has failed to stay within their designated lane. A driver drifting into another lane can sideswipe the car next to it. A driver erratically changing lanes doesn’t give the drivers around them enough time to stop or slow down to allow them to change lanes safely.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-unsafe-speed-in-texas>What is unsafe speed in Texas?</h2>
<p>Under state law, the maximum speed on Texas roadways is generally 70 mph, but the Texas Transportation Commission may set a speed limit of 75, 80, or even 85 mph if that speed is determined to be safe and reasonable after an engineering study, according to Texas Department of Transportation.</p>
<h2 id=is-driving-over-100-a-felony-in-texas>Is driving over 100 a felony in Texas?</h2>
<p>Reckless driving usually is not a felony in Texas. Texas law defines reckless driving as a misdemeanor offense.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-cause-of-the-texas-revolution>What was the main cause of the Texas Revolution?</h2>
<p>Conventions held by the Texas colonists in 1832 and 1833 resulted in resolutions petitioning the Mexican government for an extension of the tariff exemption, for administrative separation from Coahuila (that is, the establishment of Texas as a state unto itself), and for the repeal of the law preventing Anglo-American immigration.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-texans-win-the-battle-of-san-antonio>How did the Texans win the Battle of San Antonio?</h2>
<p>After fending off a Mexican attack and then successfully counterattacking in the Battle of Concepción (October 28) and winning the Grass Fight (November 26), a battle west of San Antonio over a mule train carrying grass for the Mexicans’ horses, the Texans tightened their siege.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-war-of-texas-independence-start>When did the war of Texas Independence start?</h2>
<p>See Article History. Alternative Title: War of Texas Independence. Texas Revolution, also called War of Texas Independence, war fought from October 1835 to April 1836 between Mexico and Texas colonists that resulted in Texas’s independence from Mexico and the founding of the Republic of Texas (1836–45).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-battle-of-the-texas-revolution>What was the First Battle of the Texas Revolution?</h2>
<p>After the Texan forces swelled to outnumber their adversaries (and challenged the Mexicans to “come and take it” [the cannon]), they attacked on October 2 and forced the Mexicans to retreat to San Antonio, thus winning the Texas Revolution’s first skirmish, which came to be known as the Battle of Gonzales.</p>
