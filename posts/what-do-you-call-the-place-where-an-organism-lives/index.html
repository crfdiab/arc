<h2 id=what-do-you-call-the-place-where-an-organism-lives>What do you call the place where an organism lives?</h2>
<p>Complete answer: The place where an organism lives is known as habitat. A habitat is that type of natural environment in which a particular species of an organism lives. An organism is known to share its habitat with various other biotic and abiotic components.</p>
<h2 id=where-an-organism-lives-and-what-it-does-for-a-living-is-called>Where an organism lives and what it does for a living is called?</h2>
<p>Habitat, place where an organism or a community of organisms lives, including all living and nonliving factors or conditions of the surrounding environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-all-of-the-things-an-organism-needs-and-does-within-its-habitat>What is all of the things an organism needs and does within its habitat?</h2>
<p>An organism has a role, or niche, in its habitat. A niche includes the type of food the organism eats and how it gets this food. A niche also includes when and how the organism reproduces and the physical conditions that it needs to survive.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-all-ecosystems-combined-called>What are all ecosystems combined called?</h2>
<p>Despite being many orders of magnitude different in size, both are examples of ecosystems—communities of organisms living together in combination with their physical environment. As a reminder, a community consists of all the populations of all the species that live together in a particular area.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-role-an-organism-plays-in-an-ecosystem>What is the role an organism plays in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Each organism plays a particular role in its ecosystem. A niche is the role a species plays in the ecosystem. In other words, a niche is how an organism “makes a living.” A niche will include the organism’s role in the flow of energy through the ecosystem.</p>
