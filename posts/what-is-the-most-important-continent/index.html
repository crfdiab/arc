<h2 id=which-is-the-best-continent-in-the-world>Which is the best continent in the world?</h2>
<p>Canada is one of the most friendly countries in the whole world. It is home to a perfect amount of people on the continent, not to low (ex. Oceania) not to high (e.x Asia) They have some of the best theme parks in the world along side some of the best great natural wonders of the world.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-second-most-important-continent-in-the-world>Which is the second most important continent in the world?</h2>
<p>Asia is second most important because Asia has most of the world’s factories and most of the things you wear and use are made in Asia. America is one of the most CONSUMING countries in the world. According to a study in 20018, 2% of the clothes in the world are made in America. America is very stable and the best country in my opinion.</p>

<p>Ghana being the 7th largest production of gold, Africa is the most resourceful continent. Ivory Coast and Ghana produce the most cocoa in the world which is used to make chocolate. Asia is second most important because Asia has most of the world’s factories and most of the things you wear and use are made in Asia.</p>
