<h2 id=is-the-102nd-floor-observatory-worth-it>Is the 102nd floor observatory worth it?</h2>
<p>After 10 months of renovation, the 102nd floor of the Empire State Building finally opened in October 2019. One thing is for sure, the Empire State Building’s 102nd-floor observatory view just got even better. It’s definitely one of the best observation decks in New York.</p>

<h2 id=how-is-the-eiffel-tower-related-to-the-statue-of-liberty>How is the Eiffel Tower related to the Statue of Liberty?</h2>
<p>The Eiffel Tower is a cousin of sorts to the Statue of Liberty. Before the Eiffel Tower was built, Eiffel’s firm was asked to design the internal frame for the Statue of Liberty, a task assigned to his trusted employee, Maurice Koechlin. They proved their iron handiwork with Lady Liberty first.</p>
