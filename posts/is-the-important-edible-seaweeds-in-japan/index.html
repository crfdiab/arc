<h2 id=is-the-important-edible-seaweeds-in-japan>Is the important edible seaweeds in Japan?</h2>
<p>Some 100 000 tons (product weight) of edible seaweed preparations are eaten annually in Japan, the three main products being nori, kombu and wakame. Nori is a collective name applied to various edible products derived from the purple laver, Porphyra, and certain other algae.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-edible-seaweed-called>What is edible seaweed called?</h2>
<p>Edible seaweed, also called sea vegetables, are aquatic plants known as algae (either red algae, green algae, or brown algae) that grow in the ocean. Seaweed contains amino acids called glutamates which have a salty, rich, savory taste known as umami.</p>
<h2 id=do-japanese-eat-seaweed>Do Japanese eat seaweed?</h2>
<p>Hailed as the superfood of Japanese cuisine, seaweeds have long been an indispensable part of Japanese diet and other East Asian cultures like China, Korea and Taiwan. Japanese consume seaweeds for both its nutritional properties and culinary values.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-seaweed-is-in-sushi>What kind of seaweed is in sushi?</h2>
<p>nori<br>
Also known as zicai in Chinese or gim in Korean, nori is perhaps the most recognisable seaweed on this list. The red seaweed usually comes pressed into thin dried sheets that are dark green or black which we eat as a snack or use to make sushi rolls.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-japanese-eat-seaweed>Why do Japanese eat seaweed?</h2>
<p>It has been eaten by coastal people since prehistoric times, and today 145 species of red, brown or green seaweed are used worldwide as food. In Japanese meals, more than 20 species are used – including a seaweed-based soup stock called “dashi” believed to contain chemicals forming the “fifth flavour” known as “umami”.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-japan-use-seaweed>How does Japan use seaweed?</h2>
<p>Seaweeds—and seaweed-derived products—have been central ingredients of Japanese cuisine for thousands of years. Healthy, low-calorie, packed with fiber, minerals and flavor, Japanese seaweeds are used in everything from preparing dashi broth, to salads, soups and wrapping sushi rolls.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-eat-seaweed-raw>Can you eat seaweed raw?</h2>
<p>How to Eat Edible Seaweed. Edible seaweed can be eaten raw, or used in cooked recipes. Adding either fresh or dried seaweed to your cuisine can add flavor, body, and extra nutrition. Seaweed can be used in soups either as a major component, or as a thickener – dried seaweed is particularly valuable as a thickener.</p>
<h2 id=can-western-people-digest-seaweed>Can Western people digest seaweed?</h2>
<p>Researchers have discovered that Japanese have a special bacteria in their guts to help them digest sushi, but Americans don’t. And North Americans don’t. Universite Pierre et Marie Curie researchers announced in Nature that they’ve discovered an enzyme that can breakdown seaweed.</p>
<h2 id=can-japanese-eat-raw-seaweed>Can Japanese eat raw seaweed?</h2>
<p>“Traditionally, [the Japanese] eat [seaweed] raw, not sterile,” says Czjzek. Because gut bacteria can squeeze energy from carbohydrates that human enzymes can’t break down, these adapted microbes might help Japanese who dine on seaweed get more nutrition from their meal than do North Americans, she says.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-eat-seaweed-everyday>Can I eat seaweed everyday?</h2>
<p>A primary concern is the risk of consuming too much iodine. Most seaweed contains high levels, and a person may consume too much if they eat a lot of seaweed over an extended period. While many people can handle high levels of iodine, some are more vulnerable to its effects, which can include thyroid dysfunction.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-dried-seaweed-in-japanese>What is dried seaweed in Japanese?</h2>
<p>Nori, or dried laver, is perhaps the most familiar seaweed to people outside of Japan, as it is the variety used to make sushi rolls. Nori is almost always eaten dried, and is sold in sheets or strips for making sushi, wrapping onigiri (rice balls), and for eating plain as a snack.</p>

<h2 id=what-can-you-do-with-japanese-seaweeds>What can you do with Japanese seaweeds?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most familiar of all Japanese seaweeds thanks to its use in sushi and rolls. Nori is also sold as a snack and is a good source of vitamins A and C. Try this recipe for salmon maki sushi. Full of umami and with great texture, kombu is a key ingredient in the Japanese broth known as dashi.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-type-of-seaweed-to-eat>Which is the best type of seaweed to eat?</h2>
<p>A wonderful source of magnesium, wakame is low in calories and virtually fat free. It is commonly used in seaweed salad and soups, most famously miso soup.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-use-hijiki-seaweed-for-in-recipes>What can you use hijiki seaweed for in recipes?</h2>
<p>Hijiki is believed to aid the digestive system, lower cholesterol and boost energy. It should be soaked in water for 30 minutes before using in recipes. Agar agar is most commonly used as a thickening agent in desserts and is a great vegetarian alternative to gelatin.</p>
