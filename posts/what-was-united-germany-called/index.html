<h2 id=what-was-united-germany-called>What was united Germany called?</h2>
<p>After the Frankfurt Parliament disbanded, Frederick William IV, under the influence of General Joseph Maria von Radowitz, supported the establishment of the Erfurt Union—a federation of German states, excluding Austria—by the free agreement of the German princes.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-germany-called-before-it-was-united>What was Germany called before it was united?</h2>
<p>Germania<br>
Before it was called Germany, it was called Germania. In the years A.D. 900 – 1806, Germany was part of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1949 to 1990, Germany was made up of two countries called the Federal Republic of Germany (inf. West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (inf.</p>
<h2 id=did-germany-change-its-name>Did Germany change its name?</h2>
<p>As the German language developed, the name became Deutsch and the country became Deutschland. This name took on many variations throughout Europe. The Italians, for example, translated the name to: Tedesco.</p>
<h2 id=what-old-germany-called>What old Germany called?</h2>
<p>Deutschland<br>
For example, in the German language, the country is known as Deutschland from the Old High German diutisc, in Spanish as Alemania and in French as Allemagne from the name of the Alamanni tribe, in Italian as Germania from the Latin Germania (although the German people are called tedeschi), in Polish as Niemcy from the …</p>
<h2 id=why-do-english-say-germany-not-deutschland>Why do English say Germany Not Deutschland?</h2>
<p>Originally Answered: Why is Germany in the English language not called Deutschland? There is no common root in the names Germany and Deutschland. You’re right, Matthew, about there being no common root between the names Germany and Deutschland, and that’s because they come from two very separate languages.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-german-place-names-in-the-united-states>Are there any German place names in the United States?</h2>
<p>Relatively few place names in the United States have names of German origin, unlike Spanish or French names. Many of the German town names are in the Midwest, due to high German settlement in the 1800s. Many of the names in New York and Pennsylvania originated with…</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-official-name-of-the-country-of-germany>Which is the official name of the country of Germany?</h2>
<p>The official name of the country is Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland). The terms “Westdeutschland” and “Ostdeutschland” are still used for the western and the eastern parts of the German territory, respectively.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-official-term-for-german-reunification>What was the official term for German reunification?</h2>
<p>The official and most common term in German is “Deutsche Einheit” (“German unity”); this is the term that Hans-Dietrich Genscher used in front of international journalists to correct them when they asked him about “reunification” in 1990. After 1990, the term “die Wende” became more common.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-germany-become-a-nation-after-world-war-2>When did Germany become a nation after World War 2?</h2>
<p>This changed drastically after the Holy Roman Empire’s defeat and dissolution in 1806, and even though a German Confederation was later re-established after the wars, the beginnings of an unprecedented wave of German nationalism swept through Germany during the first half of the 19th century.</p>
