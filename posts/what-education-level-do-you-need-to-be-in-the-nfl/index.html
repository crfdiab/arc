<h2 id=what-education-level-do-you-need-to-be-in-the-nfl>What education level do you need to be in the NFL?</h2>
<p>To be drafted into the NFL, a player must be three years out of high school. That means a player must at least have a high school diploma before entering the NFL. The NFL also wants players who have a little maturity and experience under their belts, and requires players to spend time playing college football.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-years-of-college-does-it-take-to-be-in-the-nfl>How many years of college does it take to be in the NFL?</h2>
<p>four years<br>
Players wanting to enter the NFL draft must use all of their college eligibility before the next college football season starts. Typically, that means they complete four years of college and graduate with a degree of their choosing. Those who have not yet graduated can petition the NFL to enter the draft early.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-play-in-the-nfl-if-you-didnt-go-to-college>Can you play in the NFL if you didn’t go to college?</h2>
<p>Anyone is allowed to enter the NFL draft, as long as they have graduated high school. If you don’t play in college, continue training hard and consider becoming a walk-on.</p>
<h2 id=do-all-nfl-players-go-to-college>Do all NFL players go to college?</h2>
<p>Therefore, most NFL players come from an NCAA team. But as there are no eligibility rules that specify the college education needed to become an NFL player, some team members don’t have a degree. Footballers often decide not to go to college because higher education is not mandatory for NFL players.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-players-in-the-nfl-that-didnt-go-to-college>Are there any players in the NFL that didn’t go to college?</h2>
<p>One of the more famous players, Ray Seals never played football in college but somehow snuck his way into the NFL. He played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1989 to 1993 as a defensive end and a nose tackle. He later played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1994 to 1995.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-go-from-highschool-to-nfl>Can you go from highschool to NFL?</h2>
<p>— No player in modern NFL history has made the leap from preps to pros. Players are ineligible to enter the NFL until three years after their high school class graduates.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-education-do-you-need-to-work-in-the-nfl>What kind of Education do you need to work in the NFL?</h2>
<p>Most candidates for these jobs should hold a minimum of a bachelor’s degree and have strong backgrounds in business, management and/or sales. Like most upper-level jobs for NFL teams, the number of positions is limited and competition can be fierce.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-go-to-college-to-be-a-football-player>Do you have to go to college to be a football player?</h2>
<p>What it does not require is a formal education. While NFL athletes do not specifically go to school to become professional football players, NFL and NCAA requirements include those related to education. To be drafted into the NFL, a player must be three years out of high school.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-requirements-to-enter-the-nfl-draft>What are the requirements to enter the NFL Draft?</h2>
<p>NFL Requirements. To be drafted into the NFL, a player must be three years out of high school. That means a player must at least have a high school diploma before entering the NFL.</p>
