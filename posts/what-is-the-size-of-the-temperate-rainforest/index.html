<h2 id=what-is-the-size-of-the-temperate-rainforest>What is the size of the temperate rainforest?</h2>
<p>Temperate rainforests cover about 75 million acres across the earth, 66% of temperate rainforests are in the Pacific North West along British Colubian and Oregon coast.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-temperate-rainforest>What is the average temperate rainforest?</h2>
<p>The average annual temperature for temperate rainforests is about 0°C (32°F) because temperate rainforests are usually located close to the ocean, but for the warmer parts of the temperate rainforests the average annual temperature is around 20°C (68°F).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-climate-in-temperate-rainforest>What is the climate in temperate rainforest?</h2>
<p>Temperate rainforests are a lot cooler than tropical rainforests, but the temperatures are still mild. They often have two distinct seasons: one long wet winter, and a short drier summer. PLANTS: One type of plant often found in a rainforest is an epiphyte.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-rain-does-a-temperate-rainforest-get>How much rain does a temperate rainforest get?</h2>
<p>High rainfall: average annual precipitation of more than 55 in (140 cm). Temperate rainforests may get additional moisture from fog and snow. There is distinct seasonal variation, unlike tropical forests, in which there is little difference between winter and summer. Average temperate of between around 39 and 54°F (4 and 12°C).</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-are-the-trees-in-the-tropical-rainforest>How tall are the trees in the tropical rainforest?</h2>
<p>The tropical rainforest is a hot, moist biome where it rains all year long. It is known for its dense canopies of vegetation that form three different layers. The top layer or canopy contains giant trees that grow to heights of 75 m (about 250 ft) or more.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-types-of-rainforest-are-there-in-the-world>How many types of rainforest are there in the world?</h2>
<p>There are two types of rainforests, tropical and temperate. Tropical rainforests are found closer to the equator and temperate rainforests are found farther north near coastal areas. The majority of common houseplants come from the rainforest. Sum Annual Precip. There are two types of rainforests, tropical and temperate.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-rain-forest-in-the-world>Which is the largest rain forest in the world?</h2>
<p>Covering an area less than half the size of the North American Pacific coast rainforests, the largest expanse is the Valdivian rainforest, the norrthernmost (37°45′ S─43° 20′ S) of three rainforests and the most species-rich. It abuts the Northern Patagonian rainforest (43° 20′ S─47° 30′ S).</p>
