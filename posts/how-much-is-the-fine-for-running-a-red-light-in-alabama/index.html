<p>In Georgia, however, the maximum fee for a red light camera ticket is $70 and there’s no conviction or recorded offense, no points, and insurers don’t use the ticket against you….How Much Is a Red Light Camera Ticket?</p>
<table><tr><th>State</th><th>Approx. Red Light Ticket Cost\*</th></tr><tr><td>Alabama</td><td>$110</td></tr><tr><td>Arizona</td><td>$165</td></tr><tr><td>California</td><td>$490</td></tr><tr><td>Colorado</td><td>$75</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-pay-a-red-light-camera-ticket-in-alabama>Do you have to pay a red light camera ticket in Alabama?</h2>
<p>A: Generally speaking, yes. Traffic camera tickets are enforceable throughout Alabama, so unless you win a successful challenge to your ticket, you will have to pay the given fee.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-are-traffic-tickets-in-alabama>How much are traffic tickets in Alabama?</h2>

<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-run-a-red-light-with-no-camera>What happens if you run a red light with no camera?</h2>
<p>Nothing at all; or you might get a traffic ticket; or you might cause a traffic collision in which you may or may not be directly involved. In that last case people may or may not be killed and you would be held responsible.</p>
<h2 id=does-running-a-red-light-affect-insurance>Does running a red light affect insurance?</h2>
<p>Red light camera tickets won’t raise your car insurance rates in most states. This is because “automated enforcement citations are generally civil or administrative violations that do not result in points and are not made part of the driver’s record,” according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, or IIHS.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-accidentally-go-through-a-red-light>What happens if you accidentally go through a red light?</h2>
<p>In most cases, the notice will ask for an admission of guilt and order the payment of a fixed penalty fine in place of taking the case to court. You’ll also have the right to appeal a penalty notice if you feel you had mitigating circumstances for running a red light.</p>
<h2 id=can-camera-tickets-hurt-your-credit>Can camera tickets hurt your credit?</h2>
<p>The end result of this policy is that speed camera citations are essentially unenforceable. Nonpayment will likely result in the debt being collected by a collection agency that no longer has the ability to negatively impact your credit report.</p>

<h2 id=how-many-miles-can-you-go-over-the-speed-limit-in-alabama>How many miles can you go over the speed limit in Alabama?</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise posted, Alabama’s absolute speed limits prohibit motorists from driving faster than: 30 miles per hour in urban districts. 35 miles per hour on unpaved roads. 45 miles per hour on county-maintained paved roads in unincorporated areas of the state.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-a-red-light-ticket>How much does it cost to get a red light ticket?</h2>
<p>On top of your red light ticket cost, you will have one point added to your driver’s license for a class C license, class A or B licenses will have 1 ½ points added if in a commercial vehicle. These stay on your record for at least three years.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-fine-for-running-a-red-light-in-arkansas>What’s the fine for running a red light in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>A red light camera ticket is approximately $ 165 (2 points). The fine for running a stop sign or red light is approximately between $130 and $185 in Arkansas. The fine for running a stop sign is approximately $250 and for running a red light is approximately $450 to $500 (and one point).</p>

<h2 id=are-there-automated-red-light-cameras-in-alabama>Are there automated red light cameras in Alabama?</h2>

The signs need to say something like, “Automated Cameras Used in Red Light Enforcement.”</p>
