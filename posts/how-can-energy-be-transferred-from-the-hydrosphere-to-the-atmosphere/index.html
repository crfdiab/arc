<h2 id=how-can-energy-be-transferred-from-the-hydrosphere-to-the-atmosphere>How can energy be transferred from the hydrosphere to the atmosphere?</h2>
<p>Once received by radiation or convection thermal energy is distributed through the atmosphere and the hydrosphere by convection and conduction.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-heat-transfer-affect-the-atmosphere>How does heat transfer affect the atmosphere?</h2>
<p>Conduction, radiation and convection all play a role in moving heat between Earth’s surface and the atmosphere. Conduction directly affects air temperature only a few centimeters into the atmosphere. During the day, sunlight heats the ground, which in turn heats the air directly above it via conduction.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-hydrosphere-affect-atmosphere>How does hydrosphere affect atmosphere?</h2>
<p>Explanation: so when pure water vapor from the water bodies get absorbed into polluted gases in the atmosphere, acid rain is caused and when this happens in a place where an element of the hydrosphere is located, it is polluted.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-heat-affect-hydrosphere>How does heat affect hydrosphere?</h2>
<p>How is the hydrosphere changing? Human contributions to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are warming the earth’s surface – a process which is projected to increase evaporation of surface water and accelerate the hydrologic cycle. In turn, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-energy-transferred-in-the-atmosphere>How is energy transferred in the atmosphere?</h2>
<p>There are three ways heat is transferred into and through the atmosphere: radiation. conduction. convection.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-sun-affect-the-atmosphere>How does the sun affect the atmosphere?</h2>
<p>The Sun warms our seas, stirs our atmosphere, generates our weather patterns, and gives energy to the growing green plants that provide the food and oxygen for life on Earth. We know the Sun through its heat and light, but other, less obvious aspects of the Sun affect Earth and society.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-the-atmosphere-and-hydrosphere-interact-with-one-another>How do the atmosphere and hydrosphere interact with one another?</h2>
<p>When a parcel of air in the atmosphere becomes saturated with water, precipitation, such as rain or snow, can fall to Earth’s surface. That precipitation connects the hydrosphere with the geosphere by promoting erosion and weathering, surface processes that slowly break down large rocks into smaller ones.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-heat-transfer-in-the-hydrosphere-affect-other-systems>How does heat transfer in the hydrosphere affect other systems?</h2>
<p>Heat transfer in the hydrosphere is cause of water currents. This movement of water that this heat transfer causes affects other Earth systems as well, like the formation of sea ice that contributes to the cryosphere, or land formations that make up the lithosphere.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-transfer-of-heat-take-place>Where does the transfer of heat take place?</h2>
<p>Heat Transfer Heat transfer occurs in both the hydrosphere and the atmosphere to disperse solar energy around the globe. This reduces the temperature difference in Earth, cooling tropic climates and warming polar climates to temperatures that would not be expected if there was no heat distribution.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-heat-move-in-the-lower-atmosphere>How does heat move in the lower atmosphere?</h2>
<p>Radiation is the transfer of energy between two objects by electromagnetic waves. Heat radiates from the ground into the lower atmosphere. In conduction, heat moves from areas of more heat to areas of less heat by direct contact. Warmer molecules vibrate rapidly and collide with other nearby molecules, transferring their energy.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-water-cycle-fuelled-by-heat-transfer>How is the water cycle fuelled by heat transfer?</h2>
<p>The water cycle is fuelled by heat transfers between and in both the atmosphere and the hydrosphere, further spreading heat between the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. Another method of heat transfer that occurs in the hydrosphere is called thermohaline circulation in the ocean.</p>
