<h2 id=what-are-three-non-living-things-in-the-tundra>What are three non-living things in the tundra?</h2>
<p>Tundra is characterized by very cold temperatures and low rainfall, creating a very cold desert. The permanently frozen ground is called permafrost. Abiotic factors are the non-living parts of an ecosystem, and these include temperature, precipitation, wind, sunlight, and weather.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-problems-in-the-tundra>What are some problems in the tundra?</h2>
<p>Tundra Threats Explained</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate Change. A warmer climate could radically change tundra landscapes and what species are able to live in them.</li>
<li>Air Pollution. Air pollution affects tundra environments in different ways.</li>
<li>Industrial Activity.</li>
<li>Invasive and Migrating Species.</li>
<li>Solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-some-abiotic-factors-in-the-arctic-tundra>What are some abiotic factors in the Arctic tundra?</h2>
<p>This biome has long cold winters and short cool summers. Some abiotic factors of the arctic tundra has low precipitation (less than 10 inches per year) and dry winds. These conditions make the Arctic tundra a desert-like climate.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-10-abiotic-factors-in-a-tundra-biome>What are 10 abiotic factors in a tundra biome?</h2>
<p>Some abiotic factors of the tundra are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1.) Permafrost. Permafrost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.) Strong and Cold Winds. Wind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3.) A Small Amount of Precipitation. Rain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4.) A Little Amount of Sunlight. A Small Amount of Sunlight.</p>

<h2 id=5-pools-of-water-on-the-surface-in-the-summer-pools-of-water-in-the-tundra-what-are-some-nonliving-things-in-the-tundra>5.) Pools of Water on the Surface in the Summer. Pools of Water in the Tundra. What are some nonliving things in the tundra?</h2>
<p>Nonliving things in the tundra such as rocks, air, water, and soil can be found in the tundra. There are lots of non living thing in the tundra like sunlight, water, rock growing season,soil and wind.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-trees-or-plants-in-the-tundra>Are there any trees or plants in the tundra?</h2>
<p>That evolved to survive in the coldest biome in the world. the word tundra derived from a Finnish word which means treeless land. There are no trees in the tundra. But there are still plants out there. There around 17000 plant species living in the tundra.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-tundra-a-unique-place-to-live>What makes the tundra a unique place to live?</h2>
<p>Permafrost prevents large plants from growing. Winds make the tundra a unique place to stay. This area receives constant harsh and strong winds to provide a SUPERFLUOUS amount of air to the organisms and biotic factors to help them survive. There is a very short summer and a very short growing season for producers in the environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-conditions-in-the-tundra-biome>What are the conditions in the tundra biome?</h2>
<p>For most of the year, the tundra biome is a cold, frozen landscape. This biome has a short growing season, followed by harsh conditions that the plants and animals in the region need special adaptations to survive.</p>
