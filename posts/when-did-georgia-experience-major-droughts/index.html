<h2 id=when-did-georgia-experience-major-droughts>When did Georgia experience major droughts?</h2>
<p>The 1950–57 drought was most severe in southern Georgia, with most stream- flows having recurrence intervals exceed- ing 25 years. In northeastern Georgia, the drought severity also exceeded the 25-year recurrence interval. In northwest- ern Georgia, the recurrence interval of the drought was between 10 and 25 years.</p>
<h2 id=is-georgia-in-drought>Is Georgia in drought?</h2>
<p>There is currently no drought level response declared for the metro Atlanta region or the state of Georgia.</p>
<h2 id=which-states-suffered-the-worst-drought>Which States suffered the worst drought?</h2>
<p>According to a U.S. Drought Monitor map published by the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the 11 states experiencing extreme drought conditions are New Mexico; Arizona; California; Nevada; Utah; Oregon; Washington; Montana; North Dakota; Colorado; and Wyoming.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-worst-drought-in-georgia>What was the worst drought in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Since 2000, the longest duration of drought (D1–D4) in Georgia lasted 161 weeks beginning on April 11, 2006, and ending on May 5, 2009. The most intense period of drought occurred the week of December 11, 2007, where D4 affected 49.86% of Georgia land.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-so-rainy-in-georgia>Why is it so rainy in Georgia?</h2>
<p>The heavy rain is a result of a band covering Eastern Louisiana, central parts of Mississippi and Alabama, all the way into Georgia. Several flash flood warnings came up weekly during this period of rain. Now, meteorologists forecast another possible week of flooding and severe storms in the South.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-drought-in-ga>When was the last drought in GA?</h2>
<p>Drought in Georgia from 2000–Present Since 2000, the longest duration of drought (D1–D4) in Georgia lasted 161 weeks beginning on April 11, 2006, and ending on May 5, 2009. The most intense period of drought occurred the week of December 11, 2007, where D4 affected 49.86% of Georgia land.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-severe-drought-in-georgia>When was the first severe drought in Georgia?</h2>
<p>The 1903–05 drought was the earliest recorded severe drought in Georgia. In 1904, the U.S. Weather Bureau (1904, p. 4) reported that levels in streams and wells were the lowest in several years. Many localities had to conserve water for stock and machinery and many factories were forced to close or operate at half capacity.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-longest-drought-in-the-united-states>When was the longest drought in the United States?</h2>
<p>When the longest stretches of drought at each location were averaged together, the longest stretch of drought for the 21st century episode averaged 37.3 months, with the peak of duration occurring in November 2003. For the 1930s drought episode, the average longest stretch was 38.4 months, peaking in March 1935.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-drought-like-in-the-1930s>What was the drought like in the 1930s?</h2>
<p>And, while the 1930s and 1950s saw more long-duration intense dry spells, the early 21st-century drought trended toward shorter bursts of extreme dryness. The 21st-century drought also saw warmer temperatures than the other two episodes.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-droughts>What do you need to know about droughts?</h2>
<p>To a meteorologist, a drought is a prolonged period when precipitation is less than normal. To a water manager, a drought is a deficiency in water supply that affects water availability and water quality. To a hydrologist, a drought is an extended period of decreased precipitation and streamflow.</p>
