<h2 id=what-do-swedes-do-for-entertainment>What do Swedes do for entertainment?</h2>
<p>Swedes are very interested in sports, with nearly one-half of the country’s inhabitants belonging to sports clubs. Outdoor recreation is important throughout the year. Facilities for mountain hiking were developed by the Swedish Touring Club about the end of the 19th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-sweden-interesting>What makes Sweden interesting?</h2>
<p>This Scandinavian country has so much green space! That’s thanks to Sweden being one of the largest countries in the European Union, with a small population of 10 million residents. Sweden offers sparse population density, extensive forest coverage, over 90,000 lakes and over 3,000 kilometres of sea coastline.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-swedish-popular-for>What is Swedish popular for?</h2>
<p>You probably know all about Abba, Ikea and meatballs. Swedish food has also hit the big time recently, going far beyond classic dishes like meatballs and pickled herring (though you can still get both at any local supermarket). …</p>
<h2 id=is-sweden-a-fun-place-to-live>Is Sweden a fun place to live?</h2>
<p>Sweden is a wonderful place to live with its kind people, excellent public services and corporate culture that encourages people to have a good work-life balance. It is no surprise that many people decide to move to Scandinavia’s largest country to enjoy all of the things that Sweden has to offer.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-most-fun-thing-to-do-in-sweden>What’s the most fun thing to do in Sweden?</h2>
<p>You’ll have fun exploring all the expressions of world-famous Swedish design, known for its graphic use of primary colors and elegant simplicity interwoven with the country’s own folk traditions. Even the buildings, city buses, traffic signs, clothing, clocks, restaurants and trains feature this iconic and clean design.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-most-popular-things-to-do-in-stockholm>What are the most popular things to do in Stockholm?</h2>
<p>Some of the most notable ones are Summerburst, Swedish Rock, Bråvalla, and Way out West. Much like Liseberg, Gröna Lund is an amusement park, but it’s located in the Capital. Here you can also see performances and concerts during summer. It’s a bit smaller than Liseberg, but it’s one of the most popular things to do in Stockholm with children.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-reason-to-go-to-sweden>What’s the best reason to go to Sweden?</h2>
<p>One of the best reasons to visit Sweden in to try and spot the Northern Lights. If you are visiting Stockholm in the south, then it’s highly unlikely you will see them, so instead you will need to head further north.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-in-marstrand-sweden-in-summer>What to do in Marstrand Sweden in summer?</h2>
<p>Each summer Marstrand is being visited by celebrities and royals, and once you’ve been there it shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a lovely place to visit where you can enjoy colorful wooden houses, sailing boats, guest harbor, gourmet food and much more.</p>
