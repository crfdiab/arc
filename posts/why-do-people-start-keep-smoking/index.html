<h2 id=why-do-people-start-keep-smoking>Why do people start keep smoking?</h2>
<p>Most people who smoke tobacco start during their teenage years or as a young adult. There are many reasons why a person starts to smoke. For some teens, it is a way to rebel against their parents. Other teens may feel pressure from their friends (peer pressure) and begin smoking as a way to appear “cool”.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-number-one-cause-of-smoking>What is the number one cause of smoking?</h2>
<p>Smoking is a major cause of cardiovascular disease, which is the single leading cause of death in the United States. Smoking causes 1 of every 3 deaths from cardiovascular disease.</p>
<h2 id=is-smoking-the-worst-thing-for-your-body>Is smoking the worst thing for your body?</h2>
<p>Smoking harms nearly every organ in your body, including your heart. Smoking can cause blockages and narrowing in your arteries, which means less blood and oxygen flow to your heart. When cigarette consumption in the U.S. decreased, so did the rates of heart disease.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-i-eat-to-stop-cigarette-cravings>What can I eat to stop cigarette cravings?</h2>
<p>4 foods and drinks that could help smokers quit</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Fruits and vegetables. Cigarettes block the absorption of important nutrients, such as calcium and vitamins C and D.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Ginseng Tea.</li>
<li>Milk and dairy.</li>
<li>Sugar-free gum and mints.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-thing-to-do-to-stop-smoking>What’s the best thing to do to stop smoking?</h2>
<p>The same US study as above also looked at drinks. Fizzy drinks, alcohol, cola, tea and coffee all make cigarettes taste better. So when you’re out, drink more water and juice. Some people find simply changing their drink (for example, switching from wine to a vodka and tomato juice) affects their need to reach for a cigarette.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-researchers-trying-to-prevent-people-from-smoking>Why are researchers trying to prevent people from smoking?</h2>
<p>So, researchers started looking into ways to prevent people from smoking. The strategy of cigarette smoking prevention has lead to many studies which attempt to identify the predictors or risk factors which lead people to smoke. We actually have quite a lot of literature on the matter!</p>
<h2 id=how-to-keep-kids-and-teens-from-smoking>How to keep kids and teens from smoking?</h2>
<p>Many teens and young adults exposed to these efforts are highly impressionable and dealing with social pressures to “fit in” with peers. Raising cigarette prices. Most teens are sensitive to pricing. Higher prices can dissuade would-be smokers. Restricting access.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-against-the-law-to-smoke-cigarettes-in-your-house>Is it against the law to smoke cigarettes in Your House?</h2>
<p>Smoking cigarettes, on the other hand, has no positive health benefits and there is no reason someone should be smoking inside. The laws connected to marijuana use are constantly changing; as a landlord, it’s best to be on your toes about this subject. There are a number of things you can do to prevent someone from smoking indoors.</p>
