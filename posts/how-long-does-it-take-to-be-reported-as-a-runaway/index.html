<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-be-reported-as-a-runaway>How long does it take to be reported as a runaway?</h2>
<p>Report. Runaways should be reported immediately every time they run. Despite what some law enforcement officials mistakenly think, there is no waiting period for reporting runaway youth. Reporting immediately sends the message to your adolescent that running away creates enormous risks and will be treated seriously.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-report-a-runaway-in-georgia>How do I report a runaway in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Anytime you obtain information about your child’s whereabouts call the Sheriff at 770-499-4600. Unless there are criminal charges it is unlikely that the runaway child will be held in a detention center.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-17-year-old-runaway-in-georgia>Can a 17 year old runaway in Georgia?</h2>
<p>In that answer, the attorney says: In the state of Georgia, a 17 year old is not legally a child and is not legally a runaway. So, a 17 year old suffers no repercussions for leaving home against the will of their parents. However, at age 17, they are effectively emancipated from their parents if they choose to be.</p>
<h2 id=do-runaways-go-to-juvie>Do runaways go to juvie?</h2>
<p>Running away from home is not usually a crime, but the individual may proceed to the juvenile courts when the local authorities arrest the youth for certain activities connected to the runaway situation.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-runaway-at-17-in-georgia>What happens if you runaway at 17 in Georgia?</h2>
<p>A 17 yr old is an adult for criminal law purposes, meaning if a 17yr commits a crime he is charged as an adult. For a 17 yr old to move out against the wishes of his parents the legal process would involve petitioning the juvenile court for emancipation.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-laws-for-runaway-children-in-the-us>Are there laws for runaway children in the US?</h2>
<p>Many states have laws on how to deal with runaway children and consequences for their actions. Any child who is a minor and is not emancipated who runs away from home is considered to be breaking the law in certain states. There are nine states with runaway laws regarding minor.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-does-a-child-have-to-be-to-be-a-runaway-in-texas>How old does a child have to be to be a runaway in Texas?</h2>
<p>There is no time limit necessary. If the child leaves home without permission and refuses to return, the child is a runaway. You may, however, run into some resistence from the local police department in taking a report. Remember, also, that in Texas age 17 makes a person an adult for criminal purposes, but a child can still be a runaway.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-be-a-runaway-in-florida>How old do you have to be to be a runaway in Florida?</h2>
<p>It’s unlawful to shelter or aid anyone who is under age 18. Florida’s “Becca Bill” declares that it is against the law for any adult “other than the child’s parent or guardian to shelter a runaway for more than 24 hours without permission of the child’s parent or a law enforcement officer.”</p>
<h2 id=when-to-report-a-runaway-to-the-police-in-florida>When to report a runaway to the police in Florida?</h2>
<p>Florida law states that police must accept a report when it is filed and there is no requirement that the teen must be missing for 24 hours. Florida law requires that all police reports for runaways should be entered into the National Crime Information Center, although the police are not required to begin a search immediately.</p>
