<h2 id=how-many-species-have-gone-extinct-in-the-rainforest>How many species have gone extinct in the rainforest?</h2>
<p>A: An average of 137 species of life forms are driven into extinction every day in the world’s tropical rainforests. The forces of destruction such as logging, cattle ranching have all contributed to the loss of millions of acres of tropical rainforest.</p>
<h2 id=what-animal-is-going-extinct-in-the-amazon-rainforest>What animal is going extinct in the Amazon rainforest?</h2>
<p>The red-faced Uakari (Cacajao calvus) is one of the most endangered monkeys in the Amazon Rainforest. The name ‘Uakari’ stems from an extinct tribe that inhabited the Amazon Rainforest many centuries ago. Habitat destruction and hunting continue to threaten this monkey and their numbers are ever-decreasing.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-rainforest-animals-go-extinct-every-year>How many rainforest animals go extinct every year?</h2>
<p>The extinction rate of today may be 1,000 to 10,000 times the biological normal, or background, extinction rate of 1-10 species extinctions per year.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a-black-jaguar-eat>What does a black jaguar eat?</h2>
<p>Jaguars are opportunistic hunters and can prey upon almost anything they come across. Capybaras, deer, tortoises, iguanas, armadillos, fish, birds and monkeys are just some of the prey that jaguars eat. They can even tackle South America’s largest animal, the tapir, and huge predators like caiman.</p>
<h2 id=is-now-an-extinct-animal>Is now an extinct animal?</h2>
<p>Since then, roughly 80 mammal species have become extinct. Extinction of taxa is difficult to confirm, as a long gap without a sighting is not definitive, but before 1995 a threshold of 50 years without a sighting was used to declare extinction.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-are-extinct-in-the-rainforest>What kind of animals are extinct in the rainforest?</h2>
<p>Animals From The RAINFOREST That Are Extinct. 1 Caddisflies. There are four extinct species of Caddisflies: Tobias’ Caddisflies, Castle Lake Caddisflies, Athens Caddisflies, and Three-tooth 2 Golden Toads. 3 Great Boas. 4 Small Crocodiles. 5 Giant Guinea Pigs.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-extinct-animals-in-the-world>Are there any extinct animals in the world?</h2>
<p>Another animal that is often mentioned among the list of extinct species is the Golden Toad. This little guy lived on Costa Rica high up in the forests. First described in 1966 it became famous for advocating endangered species with it’s unique and amazing golden appearance.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-extinct-species-of-animals-in-madagascar>Are there any extinct species of animals in Madagascar?</h2>
<p>This is also an extinct species from Madagascar (Island east of southern Africa). It looked a bit like an otter and it was a bit bigger. This was a special bird as you can see in the image below. It lived close to Madagascar on Mauritius island and it was pretty huge and it would be up to 3 feet tall (1 meter).</p>
