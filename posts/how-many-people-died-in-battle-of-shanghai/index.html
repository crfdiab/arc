<h2 id=how-many-people-died-in-battle-of-shanghai>How many people died in battle of Shanghai?</h2>
<p>300,000 people<br>
As many as 300,000 people died in the epic three-month struggle that pitted China’s best divisions against Japanese marines, tank, naval gunfire and aircraft. Yet even in China, few people remember the Battle of Shanghai, says Peter Harmsen, author of Shanghai 1937: Stalingrad on the Yangtze.</p>
<h2 id=who-controlled-shanghai-during-ww2>Who controlled Shanghai during ww2?</h2>
<p>the Japanese<br>
During World War II, about 20,000 Jewish European refugees were settled in what was known as the Shanghai Ghetto, a 1-square-mile low-rent area of the Hongkou District, a part of the International Settlement controlled by the Japanese. Life in Shanghai changed on Pearl Harbor Day, December 8 (Shanghai time), 1941.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-us-bomb-shanghai-in-1945>Did the US bomb Shanghai in 1945?</h2>
<p>On 9 August 1945, the day the United States dropped their atomic bomb on Nagasaki and the Soviets plunged into Manchuria, the Chinese Communist Party’s central committee decided to attack and occupy Shanghai with its New Fourth Army, but later abandoned this strategy in view of the disparity in strength between the KMT …</p>
<h2 id=who-colonized-shanghai>Who colonized Shanghai?</h2>
<p>British<br>
The British occupied Shanghai during the First Opium War and it was opened to foreign trade by the terms of the Treaty of Nanking. The British settlement was established by the 1845 Land Regulations, undertaken on the initiative of the intendant Gong Mujiu.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-chinese-died-in-ww2>How many Chinese died in ww2?</h2>
<p>14 million Chinese<br>
Chinese suffering during the war is not in dispute. Some 14 million Chinese died and up to 100 million became refugees during the eight years of the conflict with Japan from 1937 to 1945.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-in-shanghai-that-angered-the-japanese>What happened in Shanghai that angered the Japanese?</h2>
<p>The Chinese soldiers had to rely primarily on small-caliber weapons in their defense of Shanghai, against an overwhelming Japanese onslaught of air, naval, and armored power. In the end, Shanghai fell, and China lost a significant portion of its best troops, while failing to elicit any international intervention.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-shanghai-in-the-1920s>What was the population of Shanghai in the 1920s?</h2>
<p>Of those, only 35,000-50,000 were of European origin, but these controlled half the city. Many White Russians fled to China after the 1917 Revolution – , trickling to Shanghai along the 1920s. The number of people with Russian origins was about 35,000 by the 1930s]</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-population-density-of-shanghai-china>What is the population density of Shanghai China?</h2>

The average density of the population of the Shanghai municipality in total was 3,830 people per square kilometer that year.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-jews-first-come-to-shanghai>When did the Jews first come to Shanghai?</h2>
<p>While a Jewish community has existed in Shanghai since the late 19th century, the first large population of immigrants came in the 1920s and 30s, as thousands of European Jews fled the Bolshevik Revolution for the more friendly and safe shores in Shanghai.</p>
