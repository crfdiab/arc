<h2 id=when-did-korea-start-using-chopsticks>When did Korea start using chopsticks?</h2>
<p>The history of chopsticks in Asia is older than many countries. They’re thought to be over 5000 years old. Originating from China, they began to spread to Japan and Korea by 500 A.D. In ancient times, chopsticks were made from trees or bamboo.</p>

<p>China<br>
According to the California Academy of Sciences, which houses the Rietz Collection of Food Technology, chopsticks were developed about 5,000 years ago in China. The earliest versions were probably twigs used to retrieve food from cooking pots.</p>

<p>Koreans, however, use metal chopsticks, and they are the only people who use metal chopsticks as the norm. Not only are the chopsticks metal, but they are also flat. While you might see round bamboo chopsticks or square-sided wooden chopsticks, the metal chopsticks of Korea are relatively flat.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-chinese-and-japanese-chopsticks>What’s the difference between Chinese and Japanese chopsticks?</h2>
<p>Within about a century of this, chopsticks had migrated to other Asian countries, such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam. One distinct difference between Japanese and Chinese chopsticks was that the former were made from a single piece of bamboo that were joined at the base.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-wood-are-korean-chop-sticks-made-of>What kind of wood are Korean chop sticks made of?</h2>
<p>Unlike China, Japan, Vietnam and Thailand whose chopsticks are primarily made of wood and bamboo, Korean chopsticks were traditionally made of iron and today of stainless steel. Korean chop sticks are typically flat, like the handle of a western fork or spoon rather than round or square like other Asian cultures.</p>

<p>As such, it sticks together and is quite easily picked up by chopsticks. In comparison, many Westerners eat long grain rice (often highly processed) with is much fluffier and the individual grains are more distinct and for the unpracticed hand, difficult to eat with chopsticks.</p>
