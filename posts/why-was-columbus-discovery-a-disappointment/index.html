<h2 id=why-was-columbus-discovery-a-disappointment>Why was Columbus discovery a disappointment?</h2>
<p>On his third voyage Columbus discovered South America. Columbus was disappointed because he did not find a new route to the East. He returned to Spain in 1504. He hoped the king and queen would ask him to lead another expedition but they did not.</p>
<h2 id=why-would-columbus-be-considered-a-villain>Why would Columbus be considered a villain?</h2>
<p>His motivation to come to American continent was not noble. He set a bad example to colonists who came later. In addition, his arrival caused a catastrophe to local residents. Therefore, he is more like a villain than a hero.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-christopher-columbus-become-a-hate-figure-for-many>How did Christopher Columbus become a hate figure for many?</h2>
<p>Anti-Columbus messages are by no means the only ones being sent. Some are using it to share inspirational messages: ” ‘You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore’ – Christopher Columbus. Happy #ColumbusDay!” (Actually a quote from Andre Gide’s 1925 novel, The Counterfeiters .)</p>
<h2 id=is-it-time-to-get-rid-of-columbus-day>Is it time to get rid of Columbus Day?</h2>
<p>It is time to get rid of Columbus Day. No, not entirely, but to change the significance of the day to the remembrance of the indigenous people of that time. Columbus does not deserve a day for himself, the natives he murdered and tortured deserve the respect and recognition for what had happened.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-christopher-columbus-off-limits-to-celebrate>Why is Christopher Columbus off limits to celebrate?</h2>
<p>If Columbus is Off Limits to Celebrate, so are Indigenous Peoples The main reason some Leftists don’t want to celebrate Christopher Columbus is because his actions supposedly led to the genocide of Native American peoples.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-christopher-columbus-a-national-holiday-in-the-usa>Why is Christopher Columbus a national holiday in the USA?</h2>
<p>Most people in the United States celebrate a national holiday today, in memory of Christopher Columbus, the man often credited with “discovering” America. Many believe he doesn’t deserve the honour, however, and on social media, the campaign to re-write his legacy is getting louder every year.</p>
