<p>USS Philadelphia (1799)</p>
<table><tr><th>History</th></tr><tr><th>United States</th></tr><tr><td>Fate</td><td>Captured October 31, 1803, re-captured and burned by the U.S. Navy February 16, 1804</td></tr><tr><td>General characteristics</td></tr><tr><td>Class and type</td><td>Philadelphia-class frigate</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-did-the-americans-recapture-the-uss-philadelphia>How did the Americans recapture the USS Philadelphia?</h2>
<p>In 1803, with Captain William Bainbridge (1774-1833) of New Jersey in command, the USS Philadelphia recaptured an American warship from a Moroccan vessel and blockaded Tripoli. When the ship ran aground on an uncharted reef, Captain Bainbridge and the crew were taken captive.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-us-navy-fight-pirates>Did the US Navy fight pirates?</h2>
<p>PIRACY. The U.S. Navy is forward deployed across the globe working with its international partners protecting international shipping, and deterring, disrupting and suppressing piracy. There are three main regions the Navy focuses its efforts to combat piracy.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-stephen-decatur-an-early-military-hero-to-many-americans>Why was Stephen Decatur an early military hero to many Americans?</h2>
<p>Decatur rose to prominence during the First Barbary War against North African pirates preying on U.S. ships. In 1804 he spearheaded a mission to recapture, and if necessary destroy, the USS Philadelphia, a frigate taken by the pirates in Tripoli harbor.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-homes-have-been-seized-in-philadelphia>How many homes have been seized in Philadelphia?</h2>
<p>In two years, nearly 500 families in Philadelphia had their homes or cars taken away by city officials, according to records from Pennsylvania’s attorney general. Authorities use a civil forfeiture law that allows them to seize people’s property when that property is connected to the sale of illegal drugs.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-responsible-for-the-capture-of-philadelphia>Who was responsible for the capture of Philadelphia?</h2>
<p>Lord George Germain. General Howe had proposed to George Germain, the British civilian official responsible for conduct of the war, an expedition for 1777 to capture Philadelphia, the seat of the rebellious Second Continental Congress. Germain approved his plan, although with fewer troops than Howe requested.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-a-house-in-philadelphia-forfeited>Why was a house in Philadelphia forfeited?</h2>
<p>Police and prosecutors came armed with a lawsuit against the house itself. It was being forfeited and transferred to the custody of the Philadelphia District Attorney. Authorities said the house was tied to illegal drugs and therefore subject to civil forfeiture.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-uss-philadelphia>What was the purpose of the USS Philadelphia?</h2>
<p>Philadelphia was directed to cruise the Straits and blockade the coast of Tripoli, since in May 1801 the Pasha Yusuf Karamanli had threatened to wage war on the United States and had seized U.S. merchant vessels for ransom. Philadelphia departed Gibraltar for the United States in April 1802, arriving in mid-July.</p>
