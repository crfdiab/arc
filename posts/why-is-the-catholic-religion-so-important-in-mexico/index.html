<h2 id=why-is-the-catholic-religion-so-important-in-mexico>Why is the Catholic religion so important in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Spanish colonists introduced Roman Catholicism to Mexico in the 16th century. This religion teaches the doctrine of God as the ‘Holy Trinity’, consisting of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Today, Catholicism is synonymous with the culture and society of Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-roman-catholic-church-influence-colonization-in-the-new-world>How did the Roman Catholic Church influence colonization in the New World?</h2>
<p>The Catholic Church during the Age of Discovery inaugurated a major effort to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the indigenous peoples of the Americas and other indigenous people by any means necessary.</p>
<h2 id=what-role-did-the-catholic-church-play-in-latin-american-revolutions>What role did the Catholic Church play in Latin American revolutions?</h2>
<p>It helped to spur the conquest of the New World with its emphasis on missions to the indigenous peoples, controlled many aspects of the colonial economy, and played key roles in the struggles for Independence.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-the-catholic-church-in-the-mexican-revolution>What was the role of the Catholic Church in the Mexican Revolution?</h2>
<p>La Reforma of the late 1850s sparked an extended period of violent conflict between the conservative supporters of the old order and liberals who sought to displace and diminish the power of the Church. The Mexican Revolution was won largely anticlerical Constitutionalists and the Church’s role in Mexico was restricted constitutionally.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-catholic-church-in-latin-america>What was the Catholic Church in Latin America?</h2>
<p>The Catholic Church was undoubtedly the single most important institution in colonial Latin America.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-the-catholic-church-in-the-new-world>What was the role of the Catholic Church in the New World?</h2>
<p>The role of the Catholic Church in the ‘New World’ was of the upmost importance to both the colonizer and the colonized. However, too often it has been seen in a generalized role where the church and state acted hand in hand, without differentiation between areas, religious orders, and ecclesiastical authority.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-leader-of-the-catholic-church-in-mexico>Who is the leader of the Catholic Church in Mexico?</h2>
<p>The Catholic Church in Mexico is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope, his Curia in Rome and the national Mexican Episcopal Conference.</p>
