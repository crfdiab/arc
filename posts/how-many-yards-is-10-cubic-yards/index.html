One cubic yard of soil covers 100 square feet at a 2 inch depth.</p>

<p>Finding One Side Area If you know your room is 20 cubic yards in volume, convert that to 540 cubic feet. Measure the height of the room from floor to ceiling. If that is 9 feet, divide 540 by 9 to arrive at 60 square feet.</p>

<p>How much is ten yards of topsoil? 27 cubic feet of material, 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet, 27 cubic feet. It will cover an area of 10 feet by 10 feet to a depth of three inches, a third of a yard per 100 square feet for every inch of depth.</p>

<p>YARD TO CUBIC METER (yds TO m3) CHART. 1 yard in cubic meter = 0.76455486 yds. 10 yard in cubic meter = 7.64554858 yds. 50 yard in cubic meter = 38.2277429 yds. 100 yard in cubic meter = 76.4554858 yds.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-convert-a-square-yard-to-a-cubic-yard>How to convert a square yard to a cubic yard?</h2>
<p>To convert square yard to cubic yard, square yard must be multiplied by the thickness in inches and divide by 36. yd 3 = yd 2 * in / 36. If the thickness (height) is measured in feet (ft): To convert square yard (yd^2) to cubic yard (yd^3), square yard must be multiplied by the thickness in feet (ft) and divide by 3. yd 3 = yd 2 * ft / 3</p>
<h2 id=how-to-calculate-square-yards-per-sq-yd>How to calculate square yards per sq yd?</h2>
<p>To quickly find the square yards contained in your area, simply enter the length and width of your rectangle into the calculator above. Use any units, imperial or metric. To estimate costs, enter the price per sq yd. The calculator will instantly give you the square yards you need and the cost of the material.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-calculate-the-volume-of-a-cubic-yard>How to calculate the volume of a cubic yard?</h2>
<p>Calculate Cubic Yards 1 Calculate your area 2 Calculate your volume: Multiply area times the depth to get volume in cubic feet 3 Calculate your cubic yards: Divide cubic feet by 27 to convert to cubic yards and this is your answer 4 Where ft 2 = square foot, ft 3 = cubic foot, yd 3 = cubic yard More …</p>
