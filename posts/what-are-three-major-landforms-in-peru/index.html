<h2 id=what-are-three-major-landforms-in-peru>What are three major landforms in Peru?</h2>
<p>Peru’s landscape consists of three regions stretched north to south: the dry coastal plain (locally called the Costa) in the west, the Andes Mountains (also called the Sierra) in the center, and, in the east, the vast Amazon rainforest (usually called the Selva, and sometimes La Montaña).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-geography-important-to-peru>Why is geography important to Peru?</h2>
<p>The geographic positioning of Peru adjacent to the adjoining Nazca and South American tectonic plates – converging in the Atacama trench off the Pacific coast – serves as the catalyst to many of Peru’s natural hazards. Peru shares control of Lake Titicaca, world’s highest navigable lake, with Bolivia.</p>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-geography-is-found-in-peru>What kind of geography is found in Peru?</h2>
<p>Physical Geography. The three regions are; the coast along the Pacific Ocean, the highest parts of the Peruvian Andes for highlands, and also forest’s and jungles in the Selva. The climate in Peru is usually warm due to the reason of it being located in the tropical zone. The weather climate is about 90 degrees F. year around.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-two-flat-areas-of-peru>Where are the two flat areas of Peru?</h2>
<p>This central spine of mountain highland separates the two flat areas of Peru geography: the coastal zone to the west and the jungle zone to the east.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-up-the-macro-region-of-peru>What makes up the macro region of Peru?</h2>
<p>The Andean mountain range defines the three macro regions that make up the geography of Peru: the coast, the moutains, and the jungle. Although this classification is somewhat simplified, it actually gives us a very clear overall idea of what makes up Peru geography.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-of-a-country-is-peru-in-sq-mi>How big of a country is Peru in sq mi?</h2>
<p>Covering an area of 1,285,216 sq.km (496,225 sq mi), Peru, located in Western South America, is the world’s 19th largest country and South America’s 3rd largest country. As observed on the physical map of Peru above, the rugged Andes Mountains cover almost 40% of Peru. Hundreds of snow-capped peaks jut skyward here, with many exceeding 20,000 ft.</p>
