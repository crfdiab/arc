<h2 id=did-people-predict-hurricane-katrina>Did people predict Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>While Katrina was still a developing tropical storm over the Bahamas, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center consistently predicted Katrina would turn north toward the upper Gulf Coast. That forecast went nearly unchanged for the 56 hours prior to Katrina’s ultimate landfall.</p>
<h2 id=was-there-a-warning-or-watch-for-hurricane-katrina>Was there a warning or watch for Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>The Dire Warning In fact, Mayor Ray Nagin ordered the first-ever mandatory evacuation of New Orleans in response to the heavily worded warnings. That warning was issued nearly 24 hours before landfall.</p>
<h2 id=who-responded-to-the-emergency-of-hurricane-katrina>Who responded to the emergency of Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>The disaster recovery response to Hurricane Katrina included federal government agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the United States Coast Guard (USCG), state and local-level agencies, federal and National Guard soldiers, non-governmental organizations, charities, and private individuals.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-long-lead-warning-for-hurricane-katrina>What was the long lead warning for Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>Long lead warning times were given by the NWS Offices in Mobile, AL and New Orleans, LA as to how high the surge would be. As early as two days before landfall, the NWS Office in Mobile issued a Hurricane Local Statement (at 725pm) that foretold of the historic storm surge values of 8-12 feet well east of Katrina’s center.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-have-been-done-before-hurricane-katrina>What should have been done before Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>However, more could have been done by officials at all levels of government. For example, the EAS—a mechanism for Federal, State and local officials to communicate disaster information and instructions—was not utilized by State and local officials in Louisiana, Mississippi or Alabama prior to Katrina’s landfall. 69</p>
<h2 id=how-much-damage-did-hurricane-katrina-cause-in-new-orleans>How much damage did Hurricane Katrina cause in New Orleans?</h2>
<p>Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5 tropical cyclone that occurred in August 2005, which caused over 1,200 deaths and $125 billion in damage, particularly in the city of New Orleans and the surrounding areas.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-florida-declare-a-state-of-emergency-for-hurricane-katrina>When did Florida declare a state of emergency for Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>In Florida, Governor Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency on August 24 in advance of Hurricane Katrina’s landfall. By the following day, Florida’s Emergency Operations Center was activated in Tallahassee to monitor the progress of the hurricane. Before Katrina moved ashore, schools and businesses were closed in the Miami area.</p>
