<h2 id=why-is-my-peach-pie-runny>Why is my peach pie runny?</h2>
<p>Pay attention to bake times: one reason you’ll often end up with a runny fruit pie is simply that it hasn’t been baked long enough. Any thickener you use needs a little time to set up, and people often see their crust turning light brown and think the pie is done when it’s really not. 3.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-leave-skin-on-peaches-for-pie>Can you leave skin on peaches for pie?</h2>
<p>No need to peel the peaches — the peel provides great color, texture, and flavor. Just gently rub off the peach fuzz with a kitchen towel.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-shoofly-pie-keep>How long does shoofly pie keep?</h2>
<p>You can make this pie ahead of time, but keep in mind the crumb topping won’t be as fresh. Shoofly Pie, because it’s mostly made of molasses, keeps fairly well. Store it at room temperature for three days or in the fridge for up to five days.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-fix-a-runny-peach-pie>How do you fix a runny peach pie?</h2>
<p>How to Fix Your Runny Pie</p>
<ol>
<li>1 – Cornstarch. All it takes is a teaspoon of cornstarch for every cup of fruit that you have in your pie.</li>
<li>2 – Flour. This is one of the less-preferred options.</li>
<li>3 – Instant Pudding. Instant pudding is actually a favorite among veteran pie makers.</li>
<li>4 – Tapioca.</li>
<li>5 – Draining the Juices.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-do-you-thicken-peach-pie-filling>How do you thicken peach pie filling?</h2>
<p>When thickening a fruit pie filling, there are several options to consider. Very often flour or cornstarch is used, but in certain instances tapioca, arrowroot and potato starch can also help achieve the desired consistency.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-peaches-are-best-for-pie>What kind of peaches are best for pie?</h2>
<p>When selecting peaches for pie, choose those with darker-hued skin and bright yellow-orange flesh. These peaches are generically known as “yellow peaches” and Reliance and Sweet Scarlet are the most well-known varieties.</p>
<h2 id=can-we-eat-peaches-skin>Can we eat peaches skin?</h2>
<p>Peach skin is generally healthy and safe to eat for most people. However, peach skin may contain more pesticides than the flesh. If you want to reduce pesticide levels on peach skin, wash and peel the peach before eating it, and/or choose organic ones at the store.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-make-a-peach-pie>What’s the best way to make a peach pie?</h2>
<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Whisk together the 3/4 cup sugar, the 2 tablespoons flour, and salt. Beat in the sour cream, egg, and vanilla. Stir in the sliced peaches. Pour the mixture into the pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-filling-for-a-pennsylvania-dutch-milk-pie>What was the filling for a Pennsylvania Dutch milk pie?</h2>
<p>Often made in individual-serving pie tins, they were created to use up the trimmings of left-over pie crust from the “good pies” the cook was making (see there’s that “waste not, want not again…) The very basic ingredients for the filling were inexpensive and almost always in the pantry; flour, milk, sugar and butter.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-make-a-dutch-milk-pie>How do you make a Dutch milk pie?</h2>
<p>Made by cooks for children using left-over pie dough scraps from “the good pies” they were baking. Mix together flour and sugar with fingers or whisk in small bowl to remove lumps. Sprinkle into crust. Drizzle with milk. Stir with finger to mix. Top with butter. Sprinkle with cinnamon.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-ingredients-for-a-slop-pie>What are the ingredients for a slop pie?</h2>
<p>The very basic ingredients for the filling were inexpensive and almost always in the pantry; flour, milk, sugar and butter. Depending on the ratio of flour to sugar to milk, the filling can be very runny (guess where the moniker of “slop pie” came from) or more firm, like a soft custard.</p>
