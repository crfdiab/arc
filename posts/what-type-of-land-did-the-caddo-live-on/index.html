<h2 id=is-caddo-nomadic-or-sedentary>Is Caddo nomadic or sedentary?</h2>

<h2 id=what-did-the-caddo-grow>What did the Caddo grow?</h2>
<p>They grew corn and pumpkins as primary crops which, later combined with beans and squash, stimulated population growth. The name Caddo derives from a French abbreviation of Kadohadachho (“real chief”).</p>

<p>Caddo Ritual and Religion. In the late 17th century the Hasinai were said to believe in a supreme god called the Caddi Ayo or Ayo-Caddi-Aymay, sometimes translated as “captain of the sky.” The Caddi Ayo was believed to be the creator of all things and was held in great deference.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-the-caddo-indians-live-in-the-united-states>Where do the Caddo Indians live in the United States?</h2>
<p>Where do the Caddo Indians live? The Caddos are original residents of the southern Plains, particularly Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. Most Caddo people today live in Oklahoma. How is the Caddo Indian nation organized? The Caddo Nation has its own government, laws, police, and other services, just like a small country.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-did-the-caddo-indians-eat>What kind of food did the Caddo Indians eat?</h2>
<p>They also hunted for meat from bear, fox, turkey, deer, rabbit and other smaller game. The rivers near their villages provided fish and they also gathered wild plant foods. Food was cooked into cornbread, soups and hominy. The people also grew tobacco and a grain-bearing grass.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-caddo-people-do-after-the-underground>What did the Caddo people do after the underground?</h2>
<p>The exit from the underground closed to the remaining people and animals. The Caddo peoples moved west along the Red River, which they called Bah’hatteno in Caddo. A Caddo woman, Zacado, instructed the tribe in hunting, fishing, building dwellings, and making clothing.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-government-does-the-caddo-indians-have>What kind of government does the Caddo Indians have?</h2>
<p>The Caddo Nation has its own government, laws, police, and other services, just like a small country. However, the Caddos are also US citizens and must obey American law. In the past, each Caddo band was led by a chief chosen by a council of warriors.</p>
