<h2 id=when-did-patrick-henry-say-i-know-not-what-course-others-may-take-but-as-for-me-give-me-liberty-or-give-me-death>When did Patrick Henry say I know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death?</h2>
<p>March 23, 1775<br>
Constitution Daily On March 23, 1775, Patrick Henry signaled the coming revolution when he spoke at a Virginia convention and allegedly implored: “Give me liberty, or give me death!”</p>
<h2 id=what-virginian-famously-said-i-know-not-what-course-others-may-take-but-as-for-me-give-me-liberty-or-give-me-death>What Virginian famously said I know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death?</h2>
<p>It was in St. John’s Church in Richmond, Virginia, that Patrick Henry delivered his most famous speech. With war against Great Britain looming, Henry proclaimed, “I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”</p>
<h2 id=what-did-patrick-henry-say-we-must>What did Patrick Henry say we must?</h2>
<p>“Our petitions have been slighted,” Henry said, “our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne…we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! “The war is actually begun!” Henry cried.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-responsible-for-the-famous-quote-give-me-liberty-or-give-me-death>Who is responsible for the famous quote Give me liberty, or give me death?</h2>
<p>I first encountered Patrick Henry in fifth grade. He was the patriot of “Give me liberty, or give me death!” fame—not to be confused with that other “H” patriot, Nathan Hale, who was disappointed because he had only one life to give for his country.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-patrick-henry-shouting-give-me-liberty-or-give-me-death>Why was Patrick Henry shouting Give me liberty, or give me death?</h2>
<p>Historians say that Henry’s “Liberty or Death” speech helped convince those in attendance to begin preparing Virginia troops for war against Great Britain. Royal Governor Lord Dunmore responded to the speech by removing gunpowder from the magazine.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-after-patrick-henrys-speech>What happened after Patrick Henry’s speech?</h2>
<p>Henry’s speech is credited for inspiring the delegates to take up arms. That same day, the Provincial Congress of Virginia passed a resolution creating a militia for self-defense. Less than a month after Henry’s speech, on April 19, 1775, the first shots of the Revolutionary War were fired outside of Boston.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-give-me-liberty-or-give-me-death-come-from>Where did give me liberty or give Me Death come from?</h2>
<p>“Give me liberty or give me death.”. [From a speech given at Saint John’s Church in Richmond, Virginia on March 23, 1775 to the Virginia House of Burgesses; as first published in print in 1817 in William Wirt’s Life and Character of Patrick Henry.]”.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-henry-henry-when-he-wrote-give-me-liberty-or-give-me-death>How old was Henry Henry when he wrote Give me liberty or give Me Death?</h2>
<p>Henry’s words were not transcribed, but no one who heard them forgot their eloquence, or Henry’s closing words: “Give me liberty, or give me death!” Henry’s first biographer, William Wirt of Maryland, was three years old in 1775.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-biographer-of-henry-henry>Who was the first biographer of Henry Henry?</h2>
<p>Henry’s first biographer, William Wirt of Maryland, was three years old in 1775. An assistant federal prosecutor in Aaron Burr’s trial for treason at Richmond in 1807, and later attorney general of the United States, Wirt began to collect materials for the biography in 1808, nine years after Henry’s death.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-liberty-or-death-speech-take-place>Where did the liberty or death speech take place?</h2>
<p>Less than a month later, skirmishes between British troops and colonial minutemen at Lexington and Concord resulted in “the shot heard round the world” and the first casualties of the Revolutionary War. In Virginia, scores of colonials—many of whom had embroidered the words “Liberty or Death” onto their shirts—flocked to join local militias.</p>
