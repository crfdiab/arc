<h2 id=did-people-return-after-hurricane-katrina>Did people return after Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>The rebuilding of New Orleans, 14 years after the hurricane’s landfall, is still a work in progress. Although 90 percent of New Orleans’s pre-storm population is back and much of the city has been rebuilt, neighborhoods such as the Lower Ninth Ward have not had the same amount of post-Katrina growth.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-poorest-ward-in-new-orleans>What is the poorest ward in New Orleans?</h2>
<p>Lower Ninth Ward</p>
<table><tr><th>Lower Ninth Ward</th></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>State</td><td>Louisiana</td></tr><tr><td>City</td><td>New Orleans</td></tr><tr><td>Ward</td><td>9th</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=is-new-orleans-a-poor-state>Is New Orleans a poor state?</h2>
<p>New Orleans had the nation’s highest official poverty rate among the 50 largest metro areas in 2017, according to Census data released Thursday. Incredibly, the city’s 18.6 percent poverty rate actually brings down the average poverty rate for the state.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-hurricane-katrina-affect-peoples-lives>How did Hurricane Katrina affect people’s lives?</h2>
<p>Hurricane Katrina had many social effects, due to the significant loss and disruption of lives it caused. The hurricane left hundreds of thousands people without access to their homes or jobs, it separated people from relatives, and caused both physical and mental distress on those who suffered through the storm and its aftermath.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-children-return-to-new-orleans-after-hurricane-katrina>When did children return to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>Thousands didn’t return, and the population of children in New Orleans dropped by 43 percent between 2000 and 2010. When the Lee family returned to New Orleans about a year after the storm, several schools had reopened, but much of the system remained in chaos.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-lee-family-go-after-hurricane-katrina>Where did the Lee family go after Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>A decade after the hurricane, New Orleans’ community grapples with the effects of missed schooling and mass displacement. Ten years ago, the Lee family evacuated from New Orleans to a Houston neighborhood so rife with hostility for evacuees that the ice-cream truck refused to stop for them.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-reconstruction-period-after-hurricane-katrina>What was the Reconstruction period after Hurricane Katrina?</h2>
<p>They estimated that the restoration period – in which the built environment is made functional – would last 60 weeks and the reconstruction period – in which the built environment is rebuilt, replaced or improved – would last between 8 and 11 years. Three years after Hurricane Katrina,…</p>
