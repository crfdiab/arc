<h2 id=where-does-it-snow-near-the-ocean>Where does it snow near the ocean?</h2>
<p>Another European snowy beach destination is the Lofoten Islands in Norway. The archipelago sits in the Norwegian Sea and transforms into a winter wonderland every year.</p>
<h2 id=what-places-have-beaches-and-snow>What places have beaches and snow?</h2>
<p>So put away your flip-flops, pack your snow boots and take a nice long walk along one of these winter beaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Sand Beach, Iceland.</li>
<li>Mavericks Beach, California.</li>
<li>Shikine-jima, Japan.</li>
<li>Tofino, British Columbia.</li>
<li>Lofoten Islands, Norway.</li>
<li>Lake Tahoe, California.</li>
<li>Año Nuevo, California.</li>
<li>The Great Lakes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-do-you-not-get-snow-near-the-sea>Why do you not get snow near the sea?</h2>
<p>Consequently, the presence of relatively warm seawater warms the air along the coast, resulting in less precipitation in the form of snow. The opposite effect occurs in the summer, when relatively cold seawater cools the air along the coast making the shoreline cooler than areas further inland.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-it-snow-at-sea>How often does it snow at sea?</h2>
<p>In the climate of the past several decades, one can expect to see snowfall somewhere along the U.S. Gulf Coast about once every five years. The return rate for snowfall at sea level in central and southern California is probably more like once every 20 years, and that span appears to be getting larger (see below).</p>
<h2 id=where-in-england-does-it-not-snow>Where in England does it not snow?</h2>
<p>In a year, the UK gets slightly less than 30 days of snow, mostly received in places with high altitudes, which have colder temperatures. Most of this snow is received in Scotland while England rarely receives snow except in certain parts such as London. Even in London, it may, or it may not snow.</p>
<h2 id=does-blackpool-ever-snow>Does Blackpool ever snow?</h2>
<p>Lying anow of any depth is a rarity now, although most places may see a light snow shower or two over the winter months. It’s very rarely they have snow in Blackpool, lots of rain, but no snow.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-it-snow-in-the-middle-of-the-ocean>Where does it snow in the middle of the ocean?</h2>
<p>Iceland is far from mainland and the weather is extremely varied even in the winter, due to the Gulf Stream. Same goes with Indian and Pacific Oceans, as the western coast northward/southward flow will retard the formation of snow with latent heat of far above 32F/0C surface water.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-more-likely-to-snow-at-the-coast>Why is it more likely to snow at the coast?</h2>
<p>If average temperatures are far below freezing, low water vapor pressure limits snow, and snow is more likely and heavier at the coast. Thanks for contributing an answer to Earth Science Stack Exchange!</p>
<h2 id=why-does-it-snow-so-often-in-england>Why does it snow so often in England?</h2>
<p>By virtue of being close to the Atlantic Ocean, England’s climate is mostly mild, windy, and wet with rare temperature variations. However, compared to the other countries in the UK, England has higher temperatures on both the minimum and maximum sides. Snow events have become rarer over the years in England.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-places-in-the-world-where-it-snows>Are there any Places in the world where it snows?</h2>
<p>In places that are near the equator, it is almost always too warm to snow. In otherwise tropical locations it can snow if there are mountains, such as in Ecuador, but at lower elevations, it is very rare. Ecuador sits right on the equator (hence its name), but you can find snow on its Cayambe volcano and even go skiing, for example.</p>
