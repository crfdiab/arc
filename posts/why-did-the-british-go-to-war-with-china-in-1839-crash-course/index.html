<h2 id=why-did-the-british-go-to-war-with-china-in-1839-crash-course>Why did the British go to war with China in 1839 Crash Course?</h2>
<p>The British went to war because of Chinese military threats to defenseless British civilians, including women and children; because China refused to negotiate on terms of diplomatic equality and because China refused to open more ports than Canton to trade, not just with Britain but with everybody.</p>

<p>British traders were the primary source of the drug in China. The second Opium War was the result of the desire of Great Britain and France to win additional commercial privileges in China, including the legalization of the opium trade, as well as to gain more legal and territorial concessions in China.

<h2 id=why-did-the-british-fight-the-chinese-in-the-opium-war>Why did the British fight the Chinese in the Opium War?</h2>
<p>The British believed the Chinese had always been uncooperative, having allowed only one port, Canton, to be used by western merchants since the 18th century. There were many British politicians and merchants who viewed the dispute as an ideal opportunity to open up China. After several skirmishes, fighting began in November 1839.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-causes-and-results-of-the-opium-wars>What were the causes and results of the Opium Wars?</h2>
<p>The first Opium War was the result of China’s attempt to suppress the illegal opium trade, which had led to widespread addiction in China and was causing serious social and economic disruption there. British traders were the primary source of the drug in China.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-trade-with-china-in-the-19th-century>What was the trade with China in the 19th century?</h2>
<p>By the start of the 19th century, the trade in Chinese goods such as tea, silks and porcelain was extremely lucrative for British merchants. The problem was that the Chinese would not buy British products in return.</p>
