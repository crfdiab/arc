<h2 id=which-are-the-main-producers-in-the-ocean>Which are the main producers in the ocean?</h2>
<p>The primary producers of the ocean are microscopic phytoplankton, including protists like algae and diatoms. The majority of marine consumers are planktonic, including protists and small animals. Most decomposition is carried out by species of bacteria, enabling nutrients to cycle back to producers.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-greatest-producer-in-the-ocean>What is the greatest producer in the ocean?</h2>
<p>Phytoplankton serve as the major primary producers in the marine ecosystem. These microscopic, single-celled plants, bacteria, algae and other organisms harvest sunlight through photosynthesis and store it as chemical energy before becoming food for tiny creatures called zooplankton.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-primary-producers-in-the-ocean>Who are the primary producers in the ocean?</h2>
<p>In the majority of ocean ecosystems the source of energy is sunlight that drives photosynthesis done by micro- (phytoplankton) or macro- (seaweeds) algae, green plants, or photosynthetic blue-green or purple bacteria. These organisms produce ecosystem food that supports the food chain, hence they are referred to as primary producers.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-ocean-produce-its-own-food>How does the ocean produce its own food?</h2>
<p>Light doesn’t penetrate this area of the ocean, so the producers have to use something other than sunlight to make their food. Large hydrothermal vents deep in the ocean spew chemicals from inside the earth. These chemicals allow chemosynthetic bacteria to produce food, just like green plants use sunlight.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-phytoplankton-important-producers-in-the-ocean>Why are phytoplankton important producers in the ocean?</h2>
<p>Phytoplankton become important producers in the sea because can transform inorganic carbon in the atmosphere into organic compounds. It also provide almost all earth’s oxygen and supply food for marine ecosystems.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-producers-in-the-food-chain>Who are the producers in the food chain?</h2>
<p>The starting points in any food chain or web are the living things that make their own food. These are called producers. On land, green plants are the main producers. All the trees and other plants in this forest are made from water, sunlight and a small part of the air. Green plants make their own food.</p>
