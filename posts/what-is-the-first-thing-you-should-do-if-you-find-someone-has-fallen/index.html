<p>Call the ambulance immediately if someone falls.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prevent overcrowding around the casualty; Make space so that he or she can breathe better.</li>
<li>Do not move the casualty unless there are life-threatening hazards; He or she may have suffered a neck or spinal injury from the fall.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-to-do-if-you-find-a-patient-on-the-floor>What to do if you find a patient on the floor?</h2>
<p>In our care home’s case, if I found a resident on the floor you should immediately ring the emergency alarm and wait for my team leader to come and check the resident for any sign of injury, pain, bruises, and bleeding before deciding whether or not to call an ambulance.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-fall-down>What happens to your body when you fall down?</h2>
<p>Falls can cause broken bones, like wrist, arm, ankle, and hip fractures. Falls can cause head injuries. These can be very serious, especially if the person is taking certain medicines (like blood thinners).</p>
<h2 id=what-should-you-look-for-after-a-fall>What should you look for after a fall?</h2>
<p>Seeking medical attention right away after a fall can reduce your risk of experiencing long-lasting injury, chronic pain or even death….Symptoms of a Potential Fall Injury</p>

<li>Headaches.</li>

<h2 id=what-to-do-if-a-child-falls-from-a-height>What to do if a child falls from a height?</h2>
<h2 id=what-can-happen-after-a-fall>What can happen after a fall?</h2>
<p>What Can Happen After a Fall? Many falls do not cause injuries. But one out of five falls does cause a serious injury such as a broken bone or a head injury. These injuries can make it hard for a person to get around, do everyday activities, or live on their own.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-you-do-if-your-tree-is-falling-out>What should you do if your tree is falling out?</h2>
<p>If there are branches falling out, it’s likely that the tree is trying to make itself smaller so there’s less to feed. Pick up the branch and check for rotting or bug damage.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-branches-fall-off-a-tree>What does it mean when branches fall off a tree?</h2>
<p>If you see a large number of branches hanging off other branches, then something is up. If there are branches falling out, it’s likely that the tree is trying to make itself smaller so there’s less to feed. Pick up the branch and check for rotting or bug damage. If you notice any of these signs, that means your tree is unhealthy.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-a-tree-falls-on-your-house>What happens if a tree falls on Your House?</h2>
<p>If a healthy tree falls during a storm from “natural causes,” whoever has the damage will pay for it. Meaning that when a neighbor’s tree falls on your house, you and your insurance company will pay for the damage. What if my tree falls on the neighbor’s property?*</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-thing-to-do-if-you-fall>What’s the best thing to do if you fall?</h2>
<p>What to do if you fall. If you fall try to stay calm. Take time to assess the situation as it can take a few minutes to feel pain from injuries. What you do next will depend on if you’re hurt and whether or not you’re able to get up without help. If you already have a falls plan, try to follow it if you can.</p>
