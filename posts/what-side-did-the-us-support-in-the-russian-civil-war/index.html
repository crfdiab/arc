<h2 id=what-side-did-the-us-support-in-the-russian-civil-war>What side did the US support in the Russian Civil War?</h2>
<p>Allied side<br>
In April 1917 the United States entered the war on the Allied side. US President Woodrow Wilson dropped his reservations about joining the war with the despotic tsar as an ally, and the United States began providing economic and technical support to Kerensky’s government.</p>
<h2 id=what-group-supported-communists-during-the-russian-civil-war>What group supported Communists during the Russian Civil War?</h2>
<p>The Cheka (a forerunner of the notorious KGB), or political police, was formed in December 1917 to protect communist power. By the end of the Civil War the Cheka had become a powerful force. Among the targets of the Cheka were Russian nationalists who objected strongly to the bolshevization of Russia.</p>
<h2 id=did-america-ever-fight-russia>Did America ever fight Russia?</h2>
<p>The United States did not join the war until 1917, but did supply the Russians, and the other Allies, with war materiel. Many Americans also contributed individually to war relief for Russia.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-two-sides-in-the-civil-war>Who are the two sides in the Civil War?</h2>

Crucially, tens of thousands of black women — most also formerly enslaved — “enlisted” as unglamorous but vital domestic laborers, and occasionally as spies.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-russia-during-the-civil-war>Who was the leader of Russia during the Civil War?</h2>
<p>The Provisional Government, led by Socialist Revolutionary Party politician Alexander Kerensky, was unable to solve the most pressing issues of the country, most importantly to end the war with the Central Powers.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-known-as-the-reds-in-the-russian-civil-war>Who was known as the Reds in the Russian Civil War?</h2>
<p>These groups included monarchists, militarists, and, for a short time, foreign nations. Collectively, they were known as the Whites while the Bolsheviks were known as the Reds. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had shown to many how weak the Bolsheviks actually were.</p>
