<p>Who Was Juan Ponce de León? Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León led a European expedition for gold, which eventually brought him to the southeast coast of what would become the United States. He gave Florida its name and went on to become the first governor of Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>Ponce de León in Florida On that first expedition to Florida, Ponce de León explored the coast, including the Florida Keys, and discovered the Gulf Stream, the warm ocean current that would help future Spanish ships maneuver their way home from the New World.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-juan-ponce-de-leon-discover-in-florida>What did Juan Ponce de Leon discover in Florida?</h2>
<p>What did Juan Ponce de León discover? Juan Ponce de León is credited with being the first European to reach Florida. In April 1513 he landed on the coast of Florida at a site between Saint Augustine and Melbourne Beach. He named the region Florida because it was discovered at Easter time (Spanish: Pascua Florida).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-ponce-de-leon-join-the-second-expedition>Why did Ponce de Leon join the second expedition?</h2>
<p>The Moors were expelled from the country for good. While Juan Ponce de León no doubt celebrated this nationalist victory, he was also aware that his country no longer needed his military services. So, per History, he likely joined Christopher Columbus’ second expedition to the New World in 1493.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-ponce-de-leon-do-as-a-young-man>What did Ponce de Leon do as a young man?</h2>
<p>Then, as a young man, Ponce de León enlisted in the Spanish army during the final years of the Reconquista — Spain’s push to “reconquer” the Iberian peninsula by expelling the Moors living in the south. Ponce de León fought in the battle against the Emirate of Granada, the final Muslim stronghold in Spain.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-juan-ponce-de-leon-buried-when-he-died>Where was Juan Ponce de Leon buried when he died?</h2>
<p>In July 1521, a few days after the incident, in Havana, Juan Ponce de Leon died from his wounds. He was buried in Cuba but later relocated to the San Juan Cathedral in Puerto Rico.</p>
