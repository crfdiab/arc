<h2 id=what-did-taizong-of-the-song-dynasty-change>What did Taizong of the Song Dynasty change?</h2>
<p>Three years after assuming the throne, the Taizong emperor took over the two remaining independent states in South China, thereby nearly completing the empire’s unification. He centralized control more thoroughly than ever before in Chinese history, concentrating great power in the emperor’s hands.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-taizong-influence-chinas-growth-with-the-idea-of-a-bureaucracy>How did Taizong influence China’s growth with the idea of a bureaucracy?</h2>
<p>Taizong continued his father’s economic policies, and government remained comparatively simple and cheap. He attempted to cut down the bureaucratic establishment at the capital and drastically reduced the number of local government divisions.</p>
<h2 id=what-reforms-was-taizong-able-to-put-in-place>What reforms was Taizong able to put in place?</h2>
<p>Taizong is routinely cited for his many reforms and his policy of religious tolerance which allowed diverse religions such as Christianity and Buddhism to establish themselves in China alongside the indigenous practices of Confucianism and Taoism.</p>
<h2 id=what-role-did-tang-taizong-play-in-the-reunification-of-china>What role did Tang taizong play in the reunification of China?</h2>
<p>He is traditionally regarded as a co-founder of the dynasty for his role in encouraging Li Yuan, his father, to rebel against the Sui dynasty at Jinyang in 617. Taizong subsequently played a pivotal role in defeating several of the dynasty’s most dangerous opponents and solidifying its rule over China.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-biggest-disadvantage-of-the-song-military>What was the biggest disadvantage of the Song military?</h2>
<p>What was the biggest disadvantage of the Song military? It consumed a huge portion of the government’s revenue.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-the-tang-dynasty-have-on-china>What impact did the Tang dynasty have on China?</h2>
<p>During the rule of the Tang dynasty, China was open to the world. Tang military garrisons protected the Silk Road trade routes of Central Asia, encouraging the flow of goods, ideas, and people between China and Western Asia. Through this vast network, Chinese products, such as silk and porcelain, reached Europe.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-tang-dynasty-to-fall>What caused the Tang dynasty to fall?</h2>
<p>The An Lushan Rebellion was a devastating rebellion against the Tang dynasty of China; it significantly weakened the dynasty. The power of the jiedushi, or provincial military governors, increased greatly after imperial troops crushed the rebels, taking administrative power away from the scholar-officials.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-chinese-believe-would-help-to-scare-off-evil-spirits>What did the Chinese believe would help to scare off evil spirits?</h2>
<p>What did the Chinese believe would help to scare off evil spirits? The people believed that fireworks could help to scare off evil spirits. *Other inventions included a ceramic called porcelain, advances in mapmaking, gas cylinders for natural gas, advances in medicine, and advancements in clock making.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-emperor-taizong-help-the-tang-dynasty>How did Emperor Taizong help the Tang dynasty?</h2>
<p>He helped his father, Emperor Gaozu, to overthrow the Sui Dynasty and establish the Tang Dynasty. Once he became emperor, Taizong expanded China’s rule and ushered in the Golden Age of the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-emperor-taizong-when-he-died>How old was Emperor Taizong when he died?</h2>
<p>Death Emperor Taizong became ill during the summer of 649 and died. He was 51 years old. His ninth son, Li Zhi, took over as Emperor Gaozong. Legacy Emperor Taizong built a lasting legacy in China. His reign was considered one of the most important in Chinese history.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-heir-apparent-to-the-taizong-dynasty>Who was the heir apparent to the Taizong dynasty?</h2>
<p>Despite Taizong’s original designation of his eldest son, Li Chengjian, as heir apparent, that son’s unacceptable behaviour eventually resulted in his banishment and death. Taizong was forced to give the succession to his ninth son, Li Zhi (the future Gaozong emperor), who was not his preferred heir.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-chinese-economic-reforms>What was the result of the Chinese economic reforms?</h2>
