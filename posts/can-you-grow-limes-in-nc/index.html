<h2 id=can-you-grow-limes-in-nc>Can you grow limes in NC?</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, you can grow your own citrus in Southeastern North Carolina, and it doesn’t all have to be in pots that you move around. We started buying more citrus – none of it hardy.</p>
<h2 id=what-citrus-trees-grow-in-nc>What citrus trees grow in NC?</h2>
<p>Hardy citrus. One type of citrus plant that everyone in the Wilmington area can grow outside in the garden is a Satsuma. This sweet-tart mandarin orange type is the easiest of all cold-hardy citrus to grow, and will withstand temperatures that drop into the teens.</p>
<h2 id=what-fruit-grows-well-in-north-carolina>What fruit grows well in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Recommended fruit and nut tree crops for central North Carolina include apples, chestnuts, figs, pears (Asian and European), pecans, persimmons (American and Asian), and plums. ‘Lovell’ and ‘Halford’ rootstocks work well for peaches in the NC piedmont.</p>
<h2 id=what-states-do-limes-grow-in>What states do limes grow in?</h2>
<p>Since the North American Free Trade Agreement came into effect, many Key limes on the US market are grown in Mexico, Central America and South America. They are also grown in Texas, Florida, and California. The Key lime has given rise to several other lime varieties.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-grow-avocados-in-north-carolina>Can you grow avocados in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Avocado varieties that originate from the subtropical highlands of Mexico should be hardy with winter protection in the USDA zone 8a+ areas of North Carolina. Cultivars including ‘Mexicola Grande’, ‘Brogdon’, ‘Winter Mexican’, etc are worth a try in Eastern NC if given the proper winter protection and general care.</p>
<h2 id=what-planting-zone-is-nc>What planting zone is NC?</h2>
<p>North Carolina averages plant hardiness zone of 8a (with average winter temps from 10° F to 15° F) to a zone of 6a (with temps of -10° to -5°). Let’s look at the Triangle area a little more closely. The average extreme minimum winter temperature of the Triangle area is 5° to 10°, which is Zone 7b.</p>
<h2 id=when-should-i-plant-tomatoes-in-north-carolina>When should I plant tomatoes in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>The North Carolina Extension Service growing guide shows an April 20-July 15 planting season for tomatoes in our area. Larger tomatoes prefer nighttime temperatures between 55° and 65° for the fruit to set.</p>
<h2 id=will-an-avocado-tree-grow-in-nc>Will an avocado tree grow in NC?</h2>
<h2 id=is-there-a-lime-shortage>Is there a lime shortage?</h2>
<p>There has been virtually no demand. So, most of the available supply is going to the United States,” says Marcel Verdellen of Satori in the Netherlands. “Brazil wants to send limes but can’t do much. That’s due to the reefer equipment shortage.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-limes-grow-best>Where do limes grow best?</h2>
<p>Limes are grown mostly in Florida, California, along the Gulf Coast, and in Mexico. Limes are the least cold-tolerant of citrus fruits. They are best grown where summers are hot and winter temperatures do not drop below 20°F.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-lime-in-north-carolina>Where can I find lime in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>In North Carolina, dolomite is found only in the mountains. Both types of lime provide calcium for plants, but dolomitic lime also supplies magnesium, a nutrient often low in soils in our area. Other types of lime you may find for sell include hydrated or slaked lime and quick or burnt lime.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-ok-to-grow-a-lime-tree>Is it OK to grow a lime tree?</h2>
<p>Lime fruit has enjoyed a boost in popularity in the U.S. in the past few decades. This has prompted many home gardeners to plant a lime tree of their own. Whether you live in an area where lime trees can grow outdoors year round or if you must grow your lime tree in a container, growing lime trees can be rewarding and fun.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-citrus-trees-grown-in-north-carolina>How are citrus trees grown in North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Almost all citrus trees grown in our area have two parts: the top, or scion, where the fruit is produced, and the bottom, or rootstock, the roots of the plants. Rootstocks can make trees shorter, add disease resistance, increase cold-hardiness and help plants adapt to certain soil types.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-grow-your-own-lemons-in-nc>Can You Grow Your Own lemons in NC?</h2>
<p>Harvesting a sweet, succulent Satsuma tangerine from a tree in your backyard or picking a lemon from the Meyer lemon tree growing in your front window. Believe it or not, you can grow your own citrus in Southeastern North Carolina, and it doesn’t all have to be in pots that you move around.</p>
