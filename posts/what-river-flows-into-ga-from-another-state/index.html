<p>The Chattahoochee River forms the southern half of the Alabama and Georgia border, as well as a portion of the Florida – Georgia border….</p>

<h2 id=which-georgia-river-flows-from-the-northeastern-part-of-georgia-through-the-state-and-borders-alabama>Which Georgia river flows from the northeastern part of Georgia through the state and borders Alabama?</h2>
<p>Chattahoochee River<br>
Chattahoochee River, river having its source in several headstreams in the Blue Ridge Mountains in northeastern Georgia, U.S. It flows southwestward across northern Georgia to West Point, south of which its course marks the Georgia-Alabama and Georgia-Florida boundaries until it joins the Flint River at Chattahoochee.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-chattahoochee-river-run>Where does the Chattahoochee River Run?</h2>
<p>The Chattahoochee River originates in the southeast corner of Union County, Georgia, in the southern Appalachian Mountains and flows southwesterly through the Atlanta metropolitan area before terminating in Lake Seminole, at the Georgia-Florida border. The river runs for a total distance of about 434 miles.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-southern-boundary-of-the-state-of-georgia>What was the southern boundary of the state of Georgia?</h2>
<p>The line extended from the Mississippi River eastward to the Chattahoochee River, moved down that river to its junction with the Flint River, and then followed a direct line east to the headwaters of the St. Marys River. As a result, Georgia’s southern boundary was also that of the United States.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-river-that-flows-through-georgia>Which is the largest river that flows through Georgia?</h2>
<p>Drainage is into the Black Sea to the west and through Azerbaijan to the Caspian Sea to the east. The largest river is the Kura River, which flows 1,364 km from northeast Turkey across the plains of eastern Georgia, through the capital, Tbilisi, and into the Caspian Sea.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-river-or-creek-in-georgia>Is there a river or creek in Georgia?</h2>
<p>That means that if you live in Georgia, you live no more than a few miles from a river or stream! And of course, your local creek flows into a bigger stream or river, which is part of a greater watershed — an area of land that has one thing in common: that when rain falls within its borders, all that water eventually will flow to the same place.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-the-blackwater-rivers-in-georgia-drain-to>Where do the blackwater rivers in Georgia drain to?</h2>
<p>In central Georgia, the Oconee and Ocmulgee rivers merge to form the Altamaha River, which flows to the Atlantic Ocean. Three of the five blackwater rivers in Georgia’s coastal plain, the Ogeechee, Satilla, and St. Marys rivers, drain to the Atlantic Ocean, while the remaining two, the Suwanee and Ochlockonee, are Gulf Coast drainages.</p>
