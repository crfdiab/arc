<h2 id=what-do-engineers-do-to-help-buildings-withstand-earthquakes>What do engineers do to help buildings withstand earthquakes?</h2>
<p>In addition to strengthening a building against earthquake shocks, engineers can actually reduce the force a building is subjected to. They install what are called base isolators, which isolate the base of the building from the earth’s movements.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-study-earthquakes-in-engineering>Why do we study earthquakes in engineering?</h2>
<p>Scientists study earthquakes because they want to know more about their causes and predict where they are likely to happen. This information helps scientists and engineers build safer buildings – especially important buildings in an emergency, like hospitals and government buildings.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-engineers-are-doing-to-help-humans-survive-earthquakes>What are engineers are doing to help humans survive earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Earthquake engineers are working to make roads and buildings safer in the event of a major earthquakes. This includes both improving the design of new buildings and bridges as well as strengthening older units to incorporate the latest advances in seismic and structural engineering.</p>
<h2 id=what-engineers-are-doing-today-to-help-design-buildings-that-can-better-withstand-earthquakes>What engineers are doing today to help design buildings that can better withstand earthquakes?</h2>
<p>As the science behind earthquake engineering is constantly advancing, current engineering professionals can benefit from examining several of the innovations introduced to the industry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead-Rubber Bearings.</li>
<li>Steel Plate Shear Walls.</li>
<li>Controlled Rocking.</li>
<li>Tuned Mass Dampers.</li>
<li>Seismic Cloaking.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-is-seismology-used-to-predict-future-earthquakes>How is seismology used to predict future earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Considerable work has been done in seismology to explain the characteristics of the recorded ground motions in earthquakes. Such knowledge is needed to predict ground motions in future earthquakes so that earthquake-resistant structures can be designed.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-an-earthquake-affect-the-structure-of-a-building>How does an earthquake affect the structure of a building?</h2>
<p>The generation of inertia forces in a structure is one of the seismic influences that detrimentally affect the structure. When an earthquake causes ground shaking, the base of the building would move but the roof would be at rest. However, since the walls and columns are attached to it, the roof is dragged with the base of the building.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-prepare-for-an-earthquake>Why is it important to prepare for an earthquake?</h2>
<p>This is necessary as an earthquake is felt differently throughout a city based on factors, such as distance from the epicentre and type of buildings and type of soil; damage will be more severe for buildings constructed on soft soil as it is less stable than those built on hard rock.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-recent-development-in-earthquake-engineering>Which is a recent development in earthquake engineering?</h2>
<p>Earthquake engineering is a 20th-century development, so recent that it is yet premature to attempt to write its history. Many persons in many countries have been involved in the development of earthquake engineering and it is difficult, if not impossible to identify the contributions of each.</p>
