<h2 id=does-idaho-get-a-lot-of-tornadoes>Does Idaho get a lot of tornadoes?</h2>
<p>Idaho Tornadoes. Compared with other States, Idaho ranks number 36 for frequency of Tornadoes, none for number of deaths, 45 for injuries and 44 for cost of damages.</p>
<h2 id=does-idaho-have-any-natural-disasters>Does Idaho have any natural disasters?</h2>
<p>Natural disasters in Idaho occur in many forms. Wildfires and flooding are the two most common natural hazards that Idaho communities face, but Idaho has also experienced damage from earthquakes, a volcanic eruption, and a man-made engineering disaster (the Teton Dam Collapse).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-dangers-of-living-in-idaho>What are the dangers of living in Idaho?</h2>
<p>Both the violent crime rate and property crime rate are below the national average. The violent crime rate in Idaho is 2.7 crimes per 1000 people compared to a national average of 4.5 crimes per 1,000 people. The property crime rate in Idaho is 21.3 crimes per 1,000 people.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-worst-natural-disaster-in-idaho>What’s the worst natural disaster in Idaho?</h2>
<p>But wildfires (the Big Burn in 1910,) earthquakes (the 7.3 Borah Quake in 1983) and even volcanic ash (Mount St. Helens 1980) are among the worst natural disasters in Idaho history.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-tornado-warning-in-idaho-falls>Is there a tornado warning in Idaho Falls?</h2>
<p>IDAHO FALLS — Tornadoes aren’t something eastern Idahoans usually have to worry about, but, as we saw over the weekend, they can touch down here. On Saturday evening, while an intense storm was crossing eastern Idaho, the National Weather Service issued a tornado warning that was in effect for about 40 minutes.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-most-active-tornado-season-in-idaho>When is the most active tornado season in Idaho?</h2>
<p>Idaho’s tornado season is typically between spring and early summer when the weather is most active. When classifying tornadoes, the NWS uses the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which goes from 0 to 5. Meteorologists look at damage from the tornado to figure out its level. “It’s generally based on damage to infrastructure, to surroundings,” he said.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-tornado-hit-in-boise-idaho>Where did the tornado hit in Boise Idaho?</h2>
<p>BOISE, Idaho — On Monday, a tornado touched down about 14 miles east of Mountain Home. According to the National Weather Service, the tornado was an EF-0, which is the lowest possible level it can be. It didn’t cause any visible damage to structures or properties, and there were no injuries.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-wind-speed-of-the-tornado-in-idaho>What was the wind speed of the tornado in Idaho?</h2>
<p>Saturday’s tornado was an EF0, which means its wind speeds were between 65 to 85 mph. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale rates the intensity of a tornado based on the damage it causes, and provides an approximate of wind speed. Most tornados in eastern Idaho, and across the country, are measured at EF0 or EF1, Keyes said.</p>
