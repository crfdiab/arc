<h2 id=what-is-the-hottest-day-on-record-in-scotland>What is the hottest day on record in Scotland?</h2>
<p>That would take us within a few degrees of Scotland’s hottest July day ever, the 32.4C seen at Wauchope in Roxburghshire, on July 2, 1976.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-hottest-day-in-scotland-2021>What was the hottest day in Scotland 2021?</h2>
<p>28.2C.<br>
Scotland has recorded the hottest day of the year so far with the country currently experiencing a heatwave. The highest temperature of 2021 was seen in Threave, in Dumfries and Galloway, hitting 28.2C. All of the UK’s four nations recorded their highest temperatures of 2021.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-hottest-day-in-british-history>What is the hottest day in British history?</h2>
<p>What is the hottest temperature ever in the UK? The highest ever UK temperature was recorded in Cambridge University Botanic Garden on 25 July 2019, when the mercury hit 38.7C, beating the previous record of 38.5C in Faversham, Kent, in August 2003.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-warmest-place-in-scotland-today>Where is the warmest place in Scotland today?</h2>
<p>North-east residents are enjoying the hottest weather in Scotland today. The Met Office confirmed temperatures at Fyvie Castle reached 26.5C this afternoon.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-highest-temperature-ever-recorded-in-glasgow>What is the highest temperature ever recorded in Glasgow?</h2>
<p>31.2C<br>
(The highest recorded temperature is 31.2C, on the 4th of August 1975.) Despite some infrequent clear or dry days, winters in Glasgow are normally damp and cold. (The lowest recorded temperature is -17C on the 29th of December 1995).</p>
<h2 id=is-scotland-going-to-have-a-hot-summer-2021>Is Scotland going to have a hot summer 2021?</h2>
<p>April and May temperatures will be above normal in the north and below normal in the south, with below-normal rain. Summer will be cooler and drier than normal, with the hottest periods in early July and mid-August. September and October will bring below-normal temperatures and rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=does-it-snow-in-glasgow>Does it snow in Glasgow?</h2>
<p>Despite what many people think, Glasgow does not get much snow at all. Most of the time, when it does snow in the city, the snow doesn’t lie on the ground for very long; it normally melts quickly and turns to slush. That’s when you need wellies. Average number of days per month with gale force winds in Glasgow.</p>
