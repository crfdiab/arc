<h2 id=what-natural-disasters-does-china-face>What natural disasters does China face?</h2>
<p>In the last few decades, almost all types of major hazards except volcanic eruptions have hit China; these include earthquakes, typhoons, floods, droughts and sandstorms, storm surges, landslides and debris flows, hailstorms, cold waves, heat waves, pests and rodent disease, forest and grassland fires, and red tides.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-natural-disasters-in-china>What causes natural disasters in China?</h2>
<p>in a changing climate At both a global and a regional level, climate change has increased and will continue to exacerbate the frequency and intensity of disasters in China. The likelihood of super typhoons and intense rainfall is rising, making riverine and flash floods also more likely.</p>
<h2 id=what-natural-event-killed-the-most-people-in-china>What natural event killed the most people in China?</h2>
<p>On August 18, 1931, the Yangtze River in China peaks during a horrible flood that kills 3.7 million people directly and indirectly over the next several months. This was perhaps the worst natural disaster of the 20th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-common-natural-disaster-in-china>What is the most common natural disaster in China?</h2>

<h2 id=what-was-the-worst-natural-disaster-in-china>What was the worst natural disaster in China?</h2>
<p>Natural disasters in China. It had 5 of the world’s top 10 deadliest natural disasters; the top 3 occurred in China: the 1931 China floods, death toll 3 million to 4 million, the 1887 Yellow River flood, death toll 0.9 million to 2 million, and the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, death toll 0.83 million.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-issues-in-china>Why are there so many issues in China?</h2>
<p>Similarly, the family sector reveals countless instances of discrimination against women in China. For starters, China still suffers from excess female child mortality, as a result of the one child policy and sex-selective abortions, which favor sons over daughters.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-chinese-believe-in-natural-disasters>Why did the Chinese believe in natural disasters?</h2>
<p>Chinese believed that natural disasters would foretell the end of a dynasty or the death of a great leader. This concept of cosmic linkage between natural disasters and human conduct was radically rejected at the height of Maoist years when nature was represented as ‘an enemy to be overcome, an adversary to be brought to heel’.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-natural-hazards-in-your-area>Are there any natural hazards in your area?</h2>
<p>Be aware of ﬂ ood hazards no matter where you live, but especially if you live in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam. Even very small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts, dry streambeds, or low-lying ground that appear harmless in dry weather can ﬂ ood. Every state is at risk from this hazard. Are You Ready?
