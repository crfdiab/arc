<p>Made in the USA: Peanut butter, Pop-Tarts are among products popular primarily in America</p>

<h2 id=what-do-they-not-have-in-ireland>What do they not have in Ireland?</h2>
<p>In Ireland we do not have any killer animals, no snakes (St Patrick banished them), no tigers, no bears, no deadly spiders, no scorpions and the list goes on…. 2. In Ireland we do not pump hormones into our animals.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-us-or-ireland>Which is better US or Ireland?</h2>
<p>A few hundred thousand unemployed Irish people will find no disagreement with a recent Newsweek poll that found that the USA (11) is a better all-round place to live than Ireland (17). In terms of education, the Irish system is regarded as marginally better.</p>
<h2 id=what-american-snacks-are-not-in-ireland>What American snacks are not in Ireland?</h2>
<p>My favourite American snacks you usually can’t get here: peeps, white chocolate covered pretzels, peanut butter chocolate everything, moose munch and tapatio hot sauce. Bring me those. Twinkies. And Snickers, obviously.</p>
<h2 id=is-ireland-friendly-to-american-tourists>Is Ireland friendly to American tourists?</h2>
<p>Ireland is a very friendly country and very knowledgeable about all things American… I’ve come across hundreds of Americans while visiting Irish tourist spots on behalf of Ireland Calling and found them nearly always to be friendly, respectful and deeply interested in local culture and history.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-cheaper-to-live-in-ireland-than-the-us>Is it cheaper to live in Ireland than the US?</h2>
<p>If a city has a an index of 120, it means Numbeo estimates it is 20% more expensive than New York (excluding rent)….Definitions.</p>
<table><tr><th>STAT</th><th>Ireland</th><th>United States</th></tr><tr><td>Real estate prices > Rent index</td><td>40.45 Ranked 24th. 8% more than United States</td><td>37.45 Ranked 30th.</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=are-there-many-irish-americans-who-never-visit-ireland>Are there many Irish Americans who never visit Ireland?</h2>
<p>But there are millions of Irish-Americans who never make it to Ireland, whose stories we do not know. Usually only the economically privileged can afford to travel to Ireland. And the sheer volume of people who identify as Irish-American might in any case make it hard for all of them to visit Ireland in their lifetimes.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-irish-americans-live-in-the-us>How many Irish Americans live in the US?</h2>
<p>And the sheer volume of people who identify as Irish-American might in any case make it hard for all of them to visit Ireland in their lifetimes. The US Migration Policy Institute has recorded 39 million people as claiming Irish ancestry.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-travel-to-ireland-from-the-us>Is it legal to travel to Ireland from the US?</h2>
<p>Though most of the European Union has resumed allowing in some foreign visitors, it has continued to bar most people from the United States. The Irish government merely advises against nonessential travel to the country, but does not prohibit it, a policy set to be reviewed on July 20.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-ireland-and-the-us>What’s the difference between Ireland and the US?</h2>
<p>The Irish government seems to trusts its people — at least more than the government does in the US. The beaches aren’t monitored in Ireland. As a native of the Jersey Shore, I’m accustomed to every aspect of my beach-going experience being monitored, taxed, and controlled by the local government.</p>
