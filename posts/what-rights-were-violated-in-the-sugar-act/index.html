<h2 id=what-rights-were-violated-in-the-sugar-act>What rights were violated in the Sugar Act?</h2>
<p>The colonies disputed the legality of this act since it seemed to violate the Bill of Rights of 1689, which forbade taxation without representation and the raising and/or keeping of a standing army without the consent of Parliament.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-in-response-to-the-sugar-act>What happened in response to the Sugar Act?</h2>
<p>American colonists responded to the Sugar Act and the Currency Act with protest. In Massachusetts, participants in a town meeting cried out against taxation without proper representation in Parliament, and suggested some form of united protest throughout the colonies.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-england-establish-the-sugar-act>Why did England establish the Sugar Act?</h2>
<p>Sugar Act, also called Plantation Act or Revenue Act, (1764), in U.S. colonial history, British legislation aimed at ending the smuggling trade in sugar and molasses from the French and Dutch West Indies and at providing increased revenues to fund enlarged British Empire responsibilities following the French and Indian …</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonists-boycott-the-sugar-act>Why did the colonists boycott the Sugar Act?</h2>
<p>In response to the Sugar, Act colonists formed an organized boycott of luxury goods imported from Great Britain. 50 merchants from throughout the colonies agreed to boycott specific items and began a philosophy of self-sufficiency where they produce those products themselves, especially fabric-based products.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-sugar-act>What was the purpose of the Sugar Act?</h2>
<p>The Sugar Act was passed to counter any smuggling of foreign sugar and to force the colonies to buy sugar from England alone. This act also enabled British officials to illegally seize goods from the colonies under the pretense of counter-smuggling. In many ways, the Stamp Act was similar to the writs of assistance of 1760.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-sugar-act-bad-for-the-colonists>Why was the Sugar Act bad for the colonists?</h2>
<p>It sought to enforce the collection of the molasses and sugar taxes. This greatly angered the colonists because they had become accustomed to decades of evading this tax and, even though the Sugar Act actually lowered the tax to three pence per gallon from six, they still didn’t want to pay any tax on it.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-sugar-act-affect-molasses-smuggling>How did the Sugar Act affect molasses smuggling?</h2>
<p>The widespread smuggling of molasses actually continued until 1766 when the tax was lowered to 1 penny per gallon, lower than the cost of bribing customs officials. The Sugar Act also created a new and stringent system for importers and exporters to comply with.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-sugar-act-of-1764-do-to-rhode-island>What did the Sugar Act of 1764 do to Rhode Island?</h2>
<p>Rhode Island: Colonial period. The Sugar Act of 1764, which was meant to end the trade in smuggling sugar and molasses in the colonies, threatened Rhode Island commerce.</p>
