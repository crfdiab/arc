<h2 id=what-consists-of-all-the-communities-that-live-in-an-area-and-the-non-living-features-of-their-environment>What consists of all the communities that live in an area and the non living features of their environment?</h2>
<p>All the living things, or organisms, and nonliving things that interact in a particular area make up an ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-all-the-living-and-nonliving-factors-in-an-area-called>What is all the living and nonliving factors in an area called?</h2>
<p>An ecosystem is a biological environment consisting of all the organisms living in a particular area, as well as all the nonliving (abiotic), physical components of the environment with which the organisms interact, such as air, soil, water and sunlight.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-made-up-of-all-populations-in-an-area>What is made up of all populations in an area?</h2>
<p>A community includes all the populations of the area. The community and the abiotic factors make up the ecosystem. An organism lives in its habitat within a community.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-are-all-nonliving-parts-of-an-environment>Which of the following are all nonliving parts of an environment?</h2>
<p>The non-living components of the environment are known as abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include things such as rocks,water,soil,light,rocks etc…</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-is-an-example-of-how-an-abiotic-component-affects-a-community>Which of the following is an example of how an abiotic component affects a community?</h2>
<p>Which of the following is an example of how an abiotic component affects a community? A change in an abiotic factor. Fungi break down dead plants and release nutrients back into the soil. Plants get nutrients from the soil therefore.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-nonliving-parts-of-the-environment-called>What are the nonliving parts of the environment called?</h2>
<p>An abiotic factor is a non-living part of an ecosystem that shapes its environment. In a terrestrial ecosystem, examples might include temperature, light, and water.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-physical-environment-where-an-organism-lives>What is the physical environment where an organism lives?</h2>
<p>A habitat is a place where an organism makes its home. A habitat meets all the environmental conditions an organism needs to survive.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-up-a-community-of-living-things>What makes up a community of living things?</h2>
<p>All of the populations that live in the same area make up a community. The community that includes the goldfish population also includes the populations of other fish, coral, and other organisms. An ecosystem consists of all the living things ( biotic factors) in a given area, together with the nonliving environment ( abiotic factors ).</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-nonliving-environment>Which is an example of a nonliving environment?</h2>
<p>The nonliving environment includes water, sunlight, soil, and other physical factors. A group of similar ecosystems with the same general type of physical environment is called a biome. The biosphere is the part of Earth where all life exists, including all the land, water, and air where living things can be found.</p>

<p>T/F (If false, change to make it true) A HABITAT refers to all the populations in an ecosystem. False; community T/F (If false, change to make it true) A COMMUNITY consists of all the organisms in an ecosystem that belong to the same species.</p>
