<h2 id=where-is-the-big-bend-tunnel>Where is the Big Bend Tunnel?</h2>
<p>West Virginia<br>
Big Bend Tunnel is located near Talcott approximately 10 miles east of Hinton, West Virginia. Its construction was one of the largest projects undertaken by the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway (C&O) as it extended its railroad through southern West Virginia. When completed, it was the longest tunnel on the line.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-big-bend-tunnel-built>When was Big Bend Tunnel built?</h2>
<p>1870 and 1873<br>
The first Great Bend Tunnel was constructed between 1870 and 1873 as a throughway for the C&O rail line. It was intended to save engines an extra eight mile trip around the next bend in the rive, which earned the tunnel its name.</p>

<h2 id=how-do-i-start-a-riding-shotgun-event>How do I start a riding shotgun event?</h2>

<p>6,450 feet long<br>
The tunnel is straight, 6,450 feet long, and cuts off a seven-mile meander of the Greenbrier River around Big Bend Mountain. Construction began in February 1870 at both ends of the tunnel and in two intermediate shafts, 365 and 170 feet deep, allowing work on six faces.</p>

<h2 id=how-do-i-start-the-mystery-in-fallout-76>How do I start the mystery in Fallout 76?</h2>

<h2 id=where-is-the-big-bend-tunnel-in-west-virginia>Where is the Big Bend Tunnel in West Virginia?</h2>
<p>Big Bend Tunnel is a decommissioned tunnel on the mainline of the CSX Corporation’s rail line through southern West Virginia west of Talcott, West Virginia.

<h2 id=how-did-the-big-bend-tunnel-get-its-name>How did the Big Bend Tunnel get its name?</h2>
<p>“Big Bend” is a name for a section of the Greenbrier River where the river literally makes a big bend around Big Bend Mountain. The distance around this w-shaped bend is about a eight miles. Surveyors chose to avoid the bend by building the tunnel through the mountain.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-big-bend-tunnel-in-fallout-76>Where is the Big Bend Tunnel in Fallout 76?</h2>
<p>With the Blue Ridge Caravan Company taking over control of the tunnel entrances, the bodies of Sgt. Allemane and Sgt. Holstein of the Fire Breathers have been moved to the boxcars before the entrances. The Big Bend Tunnel appears in Fallout 76, and was expanded upon in the Wastelanders update .</p>
