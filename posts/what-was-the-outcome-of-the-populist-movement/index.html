<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-populist-movement>What was the outcome of the populist movement?</h2>
<p>In the 1892 presidential election, the Populist ticket of James B. Weaver and James G. Field won 8.5% of the popular vote and carried four Western states, becoming the first third party since the end of the American Civil War to win electoral votes. Despite the support of labor organizers like Eugene V.</p>
<h2 id=what-changes-did-the-populist-party-call-for>What changes did the Populist party call for?</h2>
<p>The party adopted a platform calling for free coinage of silver, abolition of national banks, a subtreasury scheme or some similar system, a graduated income tax, plenty of paper money, government ownership of all forms of transportation and communication, election of Senators by direct vote of the people, nonownership …</p>

<p>A social movement that turned political with Farmers’ Alliances. A revolt by farmers in the South and Midwest against the Democratic and Republican Parties for ignoring their interests and difficulties.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-populist-movement-quizlet>What caused the populist movement quizlet?</h2>
<p>Who did the populist movement appeal to? Farmers and ranchers who believed that industrialists and bankers took advantage of them by charging high prices.</p>
<h2 id=was-a-movement-to-increase-the-political-power-of-farmers>Was a movement to increase the political power of farmers?</h2>
<p>Farmers’ Alliance, an American agrarian movement during the 1870s and ’80s that sought to improve the economic conditions for farmers through the creation of cooperatives and political advocacy. The movement was made up of numerous local organizations that coalesced into three large groupings.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-farmers-alliance-and-how-did-it-work-to-improve-conditions-for-farmers>What was the farmers Alliance and how did it work to improve conditions for farmers?</h2>
<p>They supported government regulation or ownership of railways and telegraph companies, an increase in the supply of money, a graduated income tax and a decrease in tariffs, the abolition of national banks, and the establishment of subtreasuries—government warehouses in which farmers could deposit crops and borrow …</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-populist-movement-in-the-united-states>What was the Populist movement in the United States?</h2>
<p>These requests were known as the “Ocala Demands.” From these elements, a new political party, known as the “Populist Party,” emerged. The pragmatic portion of the Populist platform focused on issues of land, railroads, and money, including the unlimited coinage of silver.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-farmers-in-the-populist-movement>What was the role of farmers in the Populist movement?</h2>
<p>In contrast, the economic power of the individual farmer sunk into oblivion. Threatened by ever-plummeting commodity prices and ever-rising indebtedness, Texas agrarians met in Lampasas in 1877 and organized the first Farmers’ Alliance to restore some economic power to farmers as they dealt with railroads, merchants, and bankers.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-populist-movement-want-free-silver>Why did the Populist movement want free silver?</h2>
<p>Free silver advocates wanted the mints to accept silver on the same principle, so that anyone would be able to deposit silver bullion at a Mint and in return receive nearly its weight in silver dollars and other currency. The Populists showed impressive strength in the West and South in the 1892 elections.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-influence-of-the-peoples-party>What was the influence of the People’s Party?</h2>
<p>To me, the major influence of the People’s Party (the Populists) is that it did a great deal to lead to the rise of the Progressives in the early 1900s. As an often-quoted line goes, populism When it did this, it became Progressivism.</p>
