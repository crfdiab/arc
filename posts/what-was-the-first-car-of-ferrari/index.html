<p>1947 125 S<br>
The first Ferrari-badged car was the 1947 125 S, powered by a 1.5 L V12 engine; Enzo Ferrari reluctantly built and sold his automobiles to fund Scuderia Ferrari.</p>
<h2 id=who-owns-the-first-ferrari-ever-built>Who owns the first Ferrari ever built?</h2>
<p>It was built just after the Second World War by manufacturer Enzo Ferrari and has now been restored for $500,000 by one dedicated owner. This may seem like a lot of money, but owner Jim Glickenhaus, from Pebble Beach, California, believes the car could now fetch up to $8million.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-ferrari-start-making-cars>Why did Ferrari start making cars?</h2>
<p>Unlike many of its rivals, Ferrari is a racing operation first and car company second. Ferrari was founded as a racing team with the sale of road cars as a means to fund the racing operation.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-ferrari-come-to-america>When did Ferrari come to America?</h2>
<p>1954<br>
Ferrari brings 60 cars to Rodeo Drive to mark 60 years in the U.S. In April of 1954, a three-time Le Mans-winning race car driver named Luigi Chinetti became the official importer of Ferraris into the United States.</p>
<h2 id=why-ferrari-quit-le-mans>Why Ferrari quit Le Mans?</h2>
<p>In addition, Ferrari was now forced to race also at Le Mans, despite concerns that even the modified engine would not last. Ferrari then retired from Sports car racing to focus on the railing F1 effort.</p>
<h2 id=do-race-car-drivers-pee>Do race car drivers pee?</h2>
<p>First of all, drivers pee before the race and they use salt tablets to dehydrate. As a result, Drivers sweat a lot and fluid come out. So, the body can’t produce enough urine. The answers to that question are, NASCAR drivers don’t need to pee during the race.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-invent-a-ferrari>Who was the first person to invent a Ferrari?</h2>
<p>Enzo Ferrari of Italy, born in Modena, was the founder and creator of the first Ferrari car in 1929. Enzo Ferrari worked for Alfa Romeo and headed the motor racing department there.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-enzo-ferrari-build-his-first-car>When did Enzo Ferrari build his first car?</h2>
<p>Race cars came to the scuderia from Alfa for tuning for almost a decade, and the Ferrari shop in Modena built its first car, the Alfa Romeo 158 Grand Prix racer, in 1937. In 1938, Alfa took its racing program in-house, and Enzo Ferrari went with it. After 10 years on his own, though, working for someone else proved difficult.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-alfa-romeo-ferrari-made>Where was the first Alfa Romeo Ferrari made?</h2>
<p>Moreover, during 1937 the first examples of Alfetta 158 were assembled in Modena under Enzo Ferrari’s supervision. In 1938 Alfa Romeo brought its racing operation again in-house, forming Alfa Corse in Milano and hired Enzo Ferrari as manager of the new racing department.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-motorsport-is-ferrari-involved-in>What kind of Motorsport is Ferrari involved in?</h2>
<p>Since the company’s beginnings, Ferrari has been involved in motorsport, competing in a range of categories including Formula One and sports car racing through its Scuderia Ferrari sporting division as well as supplying cars and engines to other teams and for one make race series.</p>
