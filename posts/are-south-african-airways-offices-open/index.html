<p>On 2 May 2020, the Government of South Africa announced that South African Airways would be ceasing operations after 86 years of service, and that a new flagship carrier would be created for South Africa out of the ashes of the former airline.</p>

The carrier is wholly-owned by the South African government and operates an extensive network of services throughout Africa and international services to North America, South America, Asia, Australia and Europe. SAA became a member of the Star Alliance in 2006. SAA entered business rescue proceedings in Dec-2019.</p>
<h2 id=what-has-happened-to-saa>What has happened to SAA?</h2>
<p>SAA was placed under administration in December 2019, and its long-standing financial woes worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. That meant they had “effectively discharged the business rescue and handed over the operations of SAA back to its board and executive team”, adding SAA was now solvent.</p>
