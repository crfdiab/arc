<p>The Indian general election in 1996 returned a fractured verdict. With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerging as the largest party, with 161 of 543 seats, it was invited first to form a government. It accepted the offer, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee was sworn in as prime minister.</p>
<h2 id=who-won-the-2019-election-australia>Who won the 2019 election Australia?</h2>
<p>The 2019 federal election was held on Saturday 18 May 2019. The Liberal-National Coalition, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, won a majority in the House of Representatives with 77 of the 151 seats and 51.5 per cent of the national two-party preferred vote, a net increase of one seat on the 2016 election result.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-prime-minister-during-the-howard-government>Who was the Prime Minister during the Howard Government?</h2>
<p>Three men served in this capacity during the Howard government: Tim Fischer until July 1999, followed by John Anderson until July 2005 and then Mark Vaile. Decisions of the Executive were made either by the Cabinet or by the appropriate Minister .</p>
<h2 id=when-did-john-winston-howard-become-a-member-of-parliament>When did John Winston Howard become a Member of Parliament?</h2>
<p>Howard’s political career did not begin until 1974 when he won a seat in parliament representing the northwestern Sydney district of Bennelong. He has been returned to parliament in every election since then.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-john-winston-howard-born-and-raised>Where was John Winston Howard born and raised?</h2>
<p>Yet the pro-business measures he has taken as prime minister have led some to question his awareness of the problems of Australia’s blue-collar workers. John Winston Howard was born in the summer of 1939, the youngest of four boys, in a working-class neighborhood of Sydney called Earlwood.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-howard-government-pass-its-legislation>How did the Howard Government pass its legislation?</h2>
<p>Legislation needed the support of the Opposition or minor parties for that legislation to be passed and become law. In the 2004 election, the Coalition won control of the Senate for all but the first nine months of its fourth term, and was able to pass legislation without the support of minor parties.</p>
