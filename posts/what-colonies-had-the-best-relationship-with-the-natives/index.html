<h2 id=what-colonies-had-the-best-relationship-with-the-natives>What colonies had the best relationship with the natives?</h2>
<p>Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn and one of his most important principles was pacifism. His strong believe for non-violence allowed him to create a wonderful relationship with the Native Indians in which his colony treated the Indians with respect even though they were different culturally from the colonists.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-south-carolina-relationship-with-natives>What was South Carolina relationship with natives?</h2>
<p>South Carolina had a great relationship with the Native Americans. They talked, traded, and basically lived with them. The “tribes” helped them by trading and protecting them. But, the Indian population in South Carolina and throughout the United States greatly declined after the arrival of Europeans.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-wrong-with-the-southern-colonies>What was wrong with the Southern colonies?</h2>
<p>English American Southerners would not enjoy the generally good health of their New England counterparts. Outbreaks of malaria and yellow fever kept life expectancies lower. Since the northern colonies attracted religious dissenters, they tended to migrate in families.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-and-are-still-the-three-most-important-tribes-in-south-carolina>What were and are still the three most important tribes in South Carolina?</h2>
<p>This means that descendants of the original tribe organize themselves, either socially or politically, as a group. The Catawba, Pee Dee, Chicora, Edisto, Santee, Yamassee, and Chicora-Waccamaw tribes are all still present in South Carolina as are many descendants of the Cherokee.</p>
<h2 id=what-three-native-american-tribes-had-the-most-influence-in-south-carolina>What three Native American tribes had the most influence in South Carolina?</h2>
<p>By the time of the American Revolution, most Amerindians in South Carolina had organized into four major nations: the Cherokee, Creek, Cusabo, and Catawba.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-the-colonists-and-the-natives>What was the relationship between the colonists and the natives?</h2>
<p>The Settlers and the Natives. The Colonie’s relationship with the natives of the land that they colonied effected the way that the colonies evolve.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-southern-colonies-make-a-living>How did the southern colonies make a living?</h2>
<p>The colonists made a good living in the southern colonies and were not challenged for their land by outside influences other than the Indians towards the west and the Spanish in the south. There were many times when the Indians lashed out and killed settlers, going on raids that resulted in murders.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-problem-with-the-southern-colonies>What was the problem with the southern colonies?</h2>
<p>There were numerous tensions between the Indians in this area and the colonists. The Rappahannocks struggled with the growing colony and loss of their land, and so did the Tuscaroras. The growth of the southern colonies and trade were not the only issues impacting these natives.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-a-powerful-tribe-in-the-southern-colonies>Who was a powerful tribe in the southern colonies?</h2>
<p>Southern Colonies. The Powhatan tribe was a large and powerful tribe that influenced both Virginia and the New England colony of Massachusetts. The involvement of the tribe is noted on the New England Colonies page. They controlled the area all around the Chickahominy River.</p>
