<p>the Norman Conquest of England<br>
Before he became the king of England, William I was one of the mightiest nobles in France as the duke of Normandy, but he is best remembered for leading the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, which changed the course of English history and earned him the sobriquet William the Conqueror.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-william-the-conqueror-want-to-invade-england>Why did William the Conqueror want to invade England?</h2>
<p>Why did William the Conqueror invade England? William laid claim to the English throne after Edward died. He was a distant cousin of Edward and said that Edward had promised him the throne when visiting France in 1051. William invaded England to become King and claim the throne from Harold.</p>
<h2 id=did-william-the-conqueror-lead-the-norman-conquest>Did William the Conqueror lead the Norman Conquest?</h2>
<p>Norman Conquest, the military conquest of England by William, duke of Normandy, primarily effected by his decisive victory at the Battle of Hastings (October 14, 1066) and resulting ultimately in profound political, administrative, and social changes in the British Isles.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-william-of-conqueror-invade-england-in-1066>Why did William of Conqueror invade England in 1066?</h2>
<p>The death of Edward the Confessor in early 1066 would prompt one of the most significant military campaigns in English history, the invasion of William of Conqueror. The reasons for William’s invasion of England in 1066 are two-fold, firstly the reasons he used to legitimise his campaign and secondly the claim that he had to the English throne.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-harold-the-conqueror-get-his-claim>How did Harold the Conqueror get his claim?</h2>
<p>Harold was surprised by this move, expecting William to attack first, so he marched north and killed both his brother and the Norwegian King. One week after the victory, he received word that William had crossed the channel. He met William at Senlac hill and died in battle. William got the claim.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-english-not-want-william-to-become-king>Why did the English not want William to become king?</h2>
<p>The English didn’t want him to become king because he was from Normandy in France. William was an illegitimate child because his parents weren’t married when he was born so in 1035 when his father Robert I of Normandy went on a trip to Jerusalem he had have nobles sware that William would become duke if he was to die.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-norman-conquest>What was the result of the Norman Conquest?</h2>
<p>The thing we live with today that is a direct result of William and the Norman conquest, of course, is the language we’re speaking now, which is a mongrel tongue of English and Norman, Norman-French.</p>
