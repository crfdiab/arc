<h2 id=when-did-muslims-start-going-to-mecca>When did Muslims start going to Mecca?</h2>
<p>The Hajj is associated with the life of Islamic prophet Muhammad from the 7th century AD, but the ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of Abraham.</p>
<h2 id=who-brought-islam-to-mecca>Who brought Islam to Mecca?</h2>
<p>Muhammad<br>
It is the holiest of Muslim cities. Muhammad, the founder of Islam, was born in Mecca, and it is toward this religious centre that Muslims turn five times daily in prayer (see qiblah). All devout and able Muslims attempt a hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca at least once in their lifetime.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-muhammad-and-his-followers-leave-mecca>When did Muhammad and his followers leave Mecca?</h2>
<p>In 622 AD, Muhammad and his followers left Mecca for Medina, a journey which is referred to as the Hijrah. 622 AD is also the year in which the Islamic calendar begins. In 630 AD, the Muslims were strong enough to march an army on Mecca.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-date-of-the-conquest-of-mecca>What was the date of the conquest of Mecca?</h2>
<p>The conquest marked the end of the wars between the followers of Muhammad and the Quraysh tribe. Ancient sources vary as to the dates of these events. The date Muhammad set out for Mecca is variously given as 2, 6 or 10 Ramadan 8 AH. The date Muhammad entered Mecca is variously given as 10, 17/18, 19 or 20 Ramadan 8 AH.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-non-muslim-enter-the-holy-city-of-mecca>Can a non-Muslim enter the holy city of Mecca?</h2>
<p>Do you know that in the Holy City of Mecca, only Muslims are allowed? Non-Muslims may not enter or travel through Mecca and attempting to enter Mecca as a non-Muslim can result in penalties such as a fine or deportation from Saudi Arabia. However, in Medina, both Muslims and Non-Muslims are allowed.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-mecca-important-to-the-people-of-islam>Why was Mecca important to the people of Islam?</h2>
<p>Animism is the belief that all life is produced by spiritual forces separate from matter, and natural phenomena and objects (rocks, trees, the wind, etc.) are alive, and have souls. See section “Muhammad, Background & History. Mecca was cleansed of all its idols, and all the cult images, in the Ka’aba when Muhammad conquered Mecca in 630 AD.</p>
