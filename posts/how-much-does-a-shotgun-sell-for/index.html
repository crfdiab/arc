<h2 id=how-much-does-a-shotgun-sell-for>How much does a shotgun sell for?</h2>
<p>These classic weapons are expensive! You can get a great starter for around $1,000, but if you’re an enthusiast and a collector you might spend up to $4,500!</p>
<h2 id=are-zabala-shotguns-good>Are Zabala shotguns good?</h2>
<p>We tested the Zabala in July 2005. It scored 6 out of 10 for build quality, seven for both handling and styling, and nine for value for money. Picked out for particular praise were the price and the quality of the wood, although the tester did feel the comb could be a little higher to advantage.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-10-gauge-more-powerful-than-a-12-gauge>Is a 10 gauge more powerful than a 12-gauge?</h2>
<p>The difference is that the 10-gauge is larger and more powerful than a 12-gauge. It’s popular with goose hunters, because it throws more shot out at the same speed as a 12-gauge, making it more likely to hit a goose at extreme range, when the shot charge has spread out with a large space between pellets.</p>
<h2 id=are-12-gauge-shotguns-legal>Are 12-gauge shotguns legal?</h2>
<p>All shotguns must have a minimum barrel length of 18 inches. Individuals wishing to buy a shotgun from a licensed firearms dealer must be at least 18 years of age. Shotguns used for deer or bear must be 10 gauge, 12 gauge, 16 gauge, or 20 gauge and shoot slugs or #1 or larger buckshot.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-should-i-pay-for-a-12-gauge-shotgun>How much should I pay for a 12-gauge shotgun?</h2>
<p>You can get a good pump 12-gauge for about $250, or you can pay thousands of dollars for one. As of 2019, Cabella’s has a large range of shotguns. There are numerous single-shot shotguns you can get from Cheaper Than Dirt for $104-$150.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-1-gauge-shotgun>Is there a 1 gauge shotgun?</h2>
<p>“Is there a 1 gauge shotgun/shell?” Yes. Punt guns were made in 1 gauge (also known as “1-bore”), with a diameter of 1.669″ (42.42 mm), and barrel lengths of up to eight feet. It should be noted that the 1-bore was on the smaller end of punt guns; some had a bore of up to four inches!</p>
<h2 id=did-they-ever-make-an-8-gauge-shotgun>Did they ever make an 8 gauge shotgun?</h2>
<p>8-gauge shotgun. They are an obsolete gauge that has not been made in the U.S. since the late 19th century and are illegal today for hunting waterfowl. It’s also illegal to shoot waterfowl with lead shot. The 10-gauge shotgun is the largest one used in the U.S. today.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-such-a-thing-as-a-28-gauge-gun>Is there such a thing as a 28 gauge gun?</h2>
<p>Properly scaled 28-gauge guns, meaning guns that are built on true 28-gauge receivers rather than 28-gauge guns built on larger-gauge receivers, are quite light and a joy to hunt with.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-a-remington-28-gauge-semi-auto-weigh>How much does a Remington 28 gauge semi auto weigh?</h2>
<p>The Benelli Ethos 28-gauge semi-auto weighs just 5.4 pounds, while Benelli’s Ultra Light semi-auto takes weight all the way down to five pounds. If you prefer a little more heft than that in an autoloader, Remington’s 1100 Sporting 28 weighs 6-1/2 pounds. Weight savings aren’t limited to the guns.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-holes-in-a-28-gauge>Are there any holes in a 28 gauge?</h2>
<p>That’s a bit of an exaggeration, of course, but many 28-gauge enthusiasts insist that the 28 delivers a more uniform pattern with almost no holes and no weak outer ring, allowing it to perform better than it should.</p>
<h2 id=when-to-use-the-28-gauge-pheasant-gauge>When to use the 28 gauge pheasant gauge?</h2>
<p>The 28 works just fine on tight-holding wild birds as well as the pen-raised birds you’ll find on many hunting preserves, but you’ll likely want to step up in gauge when birds are flushing wild or far ahead, as often happens with late-season pheasants.</p>
