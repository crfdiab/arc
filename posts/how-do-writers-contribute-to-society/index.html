<h2 id=how-do-writers-contribute-to-society>How do writers contribute to society?</h2>
<p>The writer’s role is what it has always been: he is a custodian, a secretary. A writer must reflect and interpret his society, his world; he must also provide inspiration and guidance and challenge. Much writing today strikes me as deprecating, destructive, and angry.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-american-literature-change-over-time>How did American literature change over time?</h2>
<p>American Literature has changed over time by adapting previous values, beliefs, and literary characteristics when a new era presents itself; this progression is due to changing societal views in…show more content… Throughout this time period American literature shifts from American foundation into American development.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-literature-change-after-world-war-2>How did literature change after World War 2?</h2>
<p>Impressive new novelists, poets, and playwrights emerged after the war. There was, in fact, a gradual changing of the guard. Not only did a new generation come out of the war, but its ethnic, regional, and social character was quite different from that of the preceding one.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-the-writer-and-society>What is the relationship between the writer and society?</h2>
<p>It is produced by writers (human beings) who are the principal elements of the society. Writers write about societal happenings; societal happenings influence what writers write about. Thus, there exists a dialectical relationship between literature and the society. Both influence the other.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-writers-influence-us>How do writers influence us?</h2>
<p>Explanation: Writers influence our lives by their work which sometimes give lessons that can enlighten our mind in choosing what can we do. Some of the work of writers is based on reality, which is also sometimes relatable to some and giving visions.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-romanticism-crucial-to-american-culture>Why is romanticism crucial to American culture?</h2>
<p>Answer: Transcendentalism and Romanticism appealed to Americans in a similar fashion; both privileged feeling over reason and individual freedom of expression over the restraints of tradition and custom. Romanticism often involved a rapturous response to nature and promised a new blossoming of American culture.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-world-war-2-affect-american-literature>How did World war 2 affect American literature?</h2>
<p>The post World War II period had an enormous impact on American society and literature. During this period, American Literature reflected the movement of disillusionment, and portrayed the lost generation. Many WWII writers adapted new approaches and philosophies in writing their novels.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-literature-the-mirror-of-society>Why is literature the mirror of society?</h2>
<p>Literature is a mirror of society because it gives an image, but the image is not necessarily a true image. The image can be distorted in reality or perceived as distorted by society as a whole. Literature tends to focus on subjects current to societal engagement.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-writing-system-change-the-world>How did the writing system change the world?</h2>
<p>A few thousand years later, as variations on the two systems spread throughout the region, the entire ancient world had writing schemes that vastly improved the efficiency of economies, the accountability of governments and, maybe most importantly to us, our understanding of the past.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-writing-change-the-world-for-the-better>How can writing change the world for the better?</h2>
<p>If you are a fan of writing, then you already know the power it has. Writing something powerful has the ability to inspire, motivate, change lives, change minds, even change history (the bible, the alchemist). Even if writing isn’t your “thing”, you probably understand the importance of it. Writing isn’t fun for everyone, but everyone does it.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-american-society-change-during-world-war-2>How did American Society change during World War 2?</h2>
<p>During World War II, that support was propagated by the government in the form of censorship and a strategic public relations plan to maintain the public opinion in favor of the cause. Glorification of America’s involvement in the war helped America maintain the image of “a cause worth fighting for.”</p>
<h2 id=how-did-american-culture-and-attitude-change-in-the-1920s>How did American culture and attitude change in the 1920’s?</h2>
<p>How did American Culture and Attitude Change in the 1920’s? The 1920’s were a time of great social change characterized by apparent prosperity, new ideas, and personal freedom. Known as the “roaring twenties” America was reacting to the depression of the World War. It was like a giant party. New technology, new ideas and great change.</p>
