<p>In the Russian language, the word “king” ( “король” ) is used to refer a foreign Monarchy ruler as well as the most important Chess piece, while the word “tsar” would be never used for that. A king is a king, a Tsar/Czar (Caesar) is pretty much an emperor.</p>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-opera-is-a-life-for-the-tsar>What kind of opera is a life for the Tsar?</h2>
<p>A Life for the Tsar. A Life for the Tsar (Russian: “Жизнь за царя”, Zhizn’ za tsarya), is a “patriotic-heroic tragic opera” in four acts with an epilogue by Mikhail Glinka.</p>
